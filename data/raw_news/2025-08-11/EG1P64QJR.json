  "content": "\u2022 None Taylor Swift announced the title of her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\n\u2022 None She made the big reveal at 12:12 a.m. in a teaser clip from her coming appearance on \"New Heights.\"\n\u2022 None The full podcast episode will premiere on Wednesday and likely include more album details.\n\nTaylor Swift fans rejoice: The chart-topping pop star, who's been largely avoiding the spotlight since concluding the Eras Tour last December, has officially set another new era in motion.\n\nSwift announced Tuesday that her 12th studio album is titled \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" She made the big reveal in a teaser from her forthcoming appearance on \"New Heights,\" the podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce. Swift shows Jason the album cover in the brief clip, but it's blurred out.\n\nThe full episode will premiere on Wednesday at 7 p.m. and likely include more details about the album rollout \u2014 but preorder details from Swift's online store reveal that physical copies will be shipped sometime before October 13.\n\nThe singer's most attentive followers, aka \"Swifties,\" are constantly keeping an eye out for Easter eggs and hints of new music \u2014 but speculation ramped up on Monday when Taylor Nation, the social media arm of Swift's PR team, shared a collection of 12 photos from the Eras Tour, all of Swift wearing different shades of orange.\n\nThe caption said, \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era\u2026'\" with a burning-heart emoji.\n\nEven casual observers of Swift may recognize her custom of color-coding album cycles. Each color usually corresponds with the album's artwork and, in some cases, its lyrics and themes.\n\nSuch was the case for 2012's \"Red,\" named for the color Swift associates with passionate, reckless love affairs, and 2017's \"Reputation,\" an album whose black-and-white aesthetic was partially intended to evoke newsprint.\n\nLater that day, Swift's official website was updated with a countdown to 12:12 a.m. on Tuesday, August 12, set against a sparkly orange backdrop. (The numeric repetition is another of Swift's calling cards.)\n\n\"The Life of a Showgirl\" will be Swift's first new album since announcing that she bought back her masters, giving her complete ownership of her musical catalog and effectively rendering her \"Taylor's Version\" project moot. Before the big reveal in May, Swifties had been eagerly anticipating the rerecorded version of \"Reputation,\" her fan-favorite sixth album \u2014 though Swift has since confessed she has no imminent plans to release it.\n\n\"To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it,\" Swift wrote in an open letter to fans. She added that she did finish rerecording her self-titled debut album \u2014 the only other missing entry in the \"Taylor's Version\" series \u2014 though she didn't clarify when it might come to light.\n\n\"Those two albums can still have their moments to reemerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about,\" she wrote. \"But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.\"\n\nInstead, Swifties will soon get fresh tracks from the prolific songwriter. \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is the follow-up to 2024's \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" a colossal double album that topped the Billboard 200 chart for 17 weeks \u2014 the longest reign of Swift's career thus far \u2014 and spawned the No. 1 hit single \"Fortnight.\"\n\nSwifties have already circulated theories about a Sabrina Carpenter duet\n\nIn the final photo that Taylor Nation shared on Monday, Swift is singing onstage with Sabrina Carpenter, her fan-turned-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Eras Tour opener.\n\nSwifties took her inclusion as a clue that Carpenter is featured on \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" The theory is far from outlandish: Carpenter is releasing her album in August, \"Man's Best Friend,\" so she's definitely been in the studio. Moreover, she's been working closely with Jack Antonoff, Swift's go-to music producer. Antonoff coproduced Carpenter's latest single, \"Manchild.\"\n\nSwift previously collaborated with another Eras Tour opener; her duet with Gracie Abrams, \"Us,\" was included on Abrams' 2024 album \"The Secret of Us\" and nominated for a 2025 Grammy.\n\nThis story is developing.

      "text": "- Taylor Swift wrapped her $2 billion Eras Tour last year and is taking a break between album releases.\n- Critics and Swifties alike have questioned her hiatus, fueling work-life balance debates.\n- President Donald Trump even recently said Taylor Swift is \"no longer 'hot,'\" meaning popular.\nLast month, I was browsing a newsstand's magazine selection when the headline on an Us Weekly cover featuring Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce embracing made me laugh out loud: \"Why Did They Disappear?\"\nI sent a photo of the cover to my friend, a fellow Swiftie, with a snarky caption: \"No one can take time off anymore without getting pinged.\"\nThe explanations for the couple's low profile seemed so obvious: Kelce is a football player in the NFL's offseason, while last year, Swift released her 11th blockbuster album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" and wrapped the cross-continental Eras Tour that grossed over $2 billion. One would think that would set her up nicely for a worry-free vacation, even in this economy.\nInstead, Swifties are documenting each day that passes without a new Instagram post (163 as of writing) like Tom Hanks carving tally marks in \"Cast Away.\" This week, Swift simply liking a post on TikTok was framed as a major development and \"social media comeback.\" Meanwhile, WNBA star Caitlin Clark \u2014 who has publicly hung out with Swift exactly once \u2014 was asked to account for the singer's low profile. (Clark replied that Swift and Kelce are in \"vacation mode.\") Even President Donald Trump got in on the action, proudly suggesting on Truth Social on May 16 that his previous post about hating Swift was the reason she is \"no longer HOT.\"\nThe point I'd first made as a joke was starting to feel more literal. Could the public's attitude toward Swift and Kelce's brief, deserved retreat from the spotlight be a canary in the coal mine? Is the era of protecting work-life balance already over?\nTaylor Swift is famously hard-working \u2014 but fans are still demanding more\nIn the past few years, corporate workers have proudly extolled the benefits of \"quiet quitting,\" \"gentle Fridays,\" and leaving six-figure tech jobs due to burnout. Meanwhile, Gen Z has led the charge in asserting their right to use allocated vacation and sick days without fear of being perceived as lazy or undedicated.\nSwift \u2014 a self-described proud millennial, for the record \u2014 aligns more closely with the baby-boomer ethos. In a song from her latest album, she sings, \"I cry a lot but I am so productive / It's an art.\" Those are not the words of a woman taking spontaneous mental health days. In fact, Swift is renowned for rarely canceling her concerts as long as she can avoid it, often performing in extreme heat or pouring rain.\nOne might assume that in 2025, Swifties would celebrate their idol finally taking a break after spending hundreds of hours onstage over the past two years. Instead, speculation about when Swift's next album might arrive intensifies by the day. As many pop-culture update accounts have noted, this is Swift's longest online hiatus since 2017, when she withdrew from the public eye ahead of releasing \"Reputation.\" On April 26, a fan wrote on X, \"4 months without the eras tour and taylor is nowhere to be found,\" paired with a gif of a hospital patient collapsing.\nUs Weekly isn't the only publication demanding answers about Swift and Kelce's not-so-mysterious \"hiatus.\" Page Six published the headline, \"Why Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have suddenly disappeared from the limelight.\" The tabloid is also running live updates about the singer's supposed movements, mostly fueled by anonymous sources and X posts from Taylor Nation, the social media arm of her PR team.\nSure, Swift is a billionaire who has little in common with most Americans. But the thrust of these demands \u2014 for output, for accountability, for toothless cooperation with the hand that feeds \u2014 feels familiar.\nElon Musk, who led the newly created Department of Government Efficiency for the first three months of Trump's second term, has dominated news cycles with surprise firings, 120-hour workweeks, and mandatory 9 p.m. all-hands meetings. (Musk has said he's still involved with DOGE on a reduced basis.) Tesla employees \u2014 and any federal workers who have been caught in Musk's crosshairs \u2014 are implicitly required to be logged on and locked in.\nMusk isn't alone in this mindset. In recent months, many companies have implemented strict return-to-office mandates and other structural changes that, until recently, would have been criticized as too micro-manage-y.\nUnder these conditions, with men like Musk and Trump setting the national tone and anxieties about staying employed reaching new highs, it's no wonder why any time spent off the clock feels like a bubble under constant threat of popping \u2014 whether by a magazine cover questioning your disappearance or a Saturday email from HR asking for an itemized list of what you accomplished last week.\nIt's ironic, though, that just last year, Swift was chastised by critics for her hyper-productivity: Releasing a 31-track album in the midst of the Eras Tour led some to decry her business tactics as excessive, greedy, and overdone. Now, after a comparatively brief stretch of laying low and playing it cool, the script has flipped. But after two decades of extreme scrutiny, Swift is well acquainted with this tightrope walk. As she sings to open her 10th studio album, \"I'm damned if I do, give a damn what people say.\""

      "text": "- Taylor Swift's single \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n- The song is Swift's 12th chart-topper, joining the ranks of hits like \"Shake It Off\" and \"Anti-Hero.\"\n- All of Swift's No. 1 songs are listed below in chronological order of their peak dates.\n1. \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\"\nDespite writing ubiquitous hits like \"You Belong With Me\" and \"Love Story\" earlier in her career (which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4, respectively), \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" was Swift's first-ever song to top the chart.\nThe country-pop-crossover smash was released as the lead single from Swift's fourth studio album \"Red.\" It rose from No. 72 to No. 1 in its second week of tracking and remained atop the chart for three weeks.\n2. \"Shake It Off\"\n\"Shake It Off\" was released as the lead single from Swift's fifth album \"1989.\" It became her first song to debut at No. 1 and remained atop the chart for four weeks.\n3. \"Blank Space\"\n\"Blank Space,\" the second single from \"1989,\" debuted at No. 18 on the Hot 100.\nIt rose to No. 13 before soaring to No. 1 in its third week \u2014 dethroning \"Shake It Off\" and making Swift the first woman in history to replace herself in the chart's top spot.\n\"Blank Space\" went on to become one of Swift's biggest hits, reigning atop the chart for seven weeks.\n4. \"Bad Blood\" featuring Kendrick Lamar\nA remix of \"Bad Blood\" featuring Kendrick Lamar was released as the fourth single from \"1989\" on May 17, 2015.\nIt rose from No. 53 to the chart's top spot after the music video premiered at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards and broke the Vevo record for most views in 24 hours.\n5. \"Look What You Made Me Do\"\nDespite mixed reactions from critics, Swift's lead single for \"Reputation\" rose to No. 1 after its first full week of tracking, breaking the weekly streaming record for a song by a woman.\nOnce again, Swift's music video broke the record for most views within 24 hours, racking up 43.2 million views in its first day.\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" remained atop the chart for three weeks.\n6. \"Cardigan\"\nSwift announced the arrival of her eighth album, \"Folklore,\" just one day in advance. The second track, \"Cardigan,\" was released at the same time as the album and promoted with a whimsical music video.\n\"Folklore\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 while \"Cardigan\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist in history to open atop both charts in the same week.\n7. \"Willow\"\nJust five months after \"Folklore,\" Swift repeated her pandemic-era strategy and surprise-released \"Evermore\" alongside its lead single. The music video for \"Willow\" is painted as a witchy sequel to \"Cardigan,\" with plenty of Easter eggs for fans buried in the details.\nAgain, \"Evermore\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 while \"Willow\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to debut atop both charts simultaneously \u2014 twice. (She has now done it six times.)\n8. \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault)\"\n\"Red (Taylor's Version)\" was the second rerecorded album Swift released. It was accompanied by the long-awaited extended version of \"All Too Well,\" a fan-favorite track from the original album.\n\"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" was promoted with a self-directed short film and plenty of theories about the song's potential muse.\nIt debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart. (The record was previously held by Don McLean's \"American Pie (Parts I & II)\" at 8 minutes and 37 seconds.)\n9. \"Anti-Hero\"\n\"Anti-Hero\" was released alongside \"Midnights\" and promoted as the album's lead single.\nIt quickly became Swift's biggest hit ever, reigning atop the Hot 100 for eight weeks and surpassing \"Blank Space\" as her longest-running No. 1 song.\nThe same week that \"Anti-Hero\" debuted at No. 1, Swift became the first and only artist in history to occupy the entire top 10 on the Hot 100. The hit single was flanked by \"Lavender Haze\" (No. 2), \"Maroon\" (No. 3), \"Snow on the Beach\" (No. 4), \"Midnight Rain\" (No. 5), \"Bejeweled\" (No. 6), \"Question...?\" (No. 7), \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" (No. 8), \"Karma\" (No. 9), and \"Vigilante Shit\" (No. 10).\n10. \"Cruel Summer\"\n\"Cruel Summer\" was originally released as the second track on Swift's 2019 album \"Lover.\"\nAlthough it was identified early as a fan favorite, the song was never promoted as a single and debuted modestly at No. 29 on the Hot 100.\nFour years later, Swift transformed \"Cruel Summer\" into a showstopping spectacle on The Eras Tour. Streams of the song began to surge and it reigned atop Billboard's Pop Airplay chart for two months. Swift's label sent the song to pop radio in June 2023.\nFinally, following the release of \"The Cruelest Summer\" EP \u2014 which includes a live version of the song and a remix by LP Giobbi \u2014 the song reached No. 1 on the Hot 100, marking Swift's milestone 10th chart-topper. It later returned to the top spot, notching four weeks total.\n11. \"Is It Over Now?\"\n\"Is It Over Now?\" was released as the final vault track on \"1989 (Taylor's Version),\" a rerecording of her beloved fifth album.\nAlthough it wasn't initially slated as a single, passionate fan reception pushed Swift's team to serve the song to pop radio.\n\"Is It Over Now?\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, dethroning \"Cruel Summer.\" Swift remains the only woman in history to replace herself in the top spot; she previously achieved the feat in 2014, when \"Blank Space\" took the crown from \"Shake It Off.\"\n12. \"Fortnight\" featuring Post Malone\n\"Fortnight\" was released alongside \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and promoted as the album's lead single.\nThe Post Malone duet debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 while \"Poets\" simultaneously debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, earning Swift's biggest sales week to date.\nOnce again, Swift managed to occupy the entire top 10 of the Hot 100, becoming the first and only artist to achieve the feat twice. In fact, the top 14 positions on the chart were occupied by \"Poets\" tracks, including \"Down Bad\" (No. 2) and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" (No. 3), all the way through to \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" (No. 14).\nSwift is now tied with Madonna and The Supremes for the fifth-most No. 1 hits in history."

The below list includes Brittany Howard's earthy funk from Athens, Alabama; Tems' alt\u00e9 from Nigeria; The Mar\u00edas' dream-pop from Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Puerto Rico; The Last Dinner Party's indie-rock from London, and many more.\nKeep reading for all 20 top picks, ranked in ascending order.\n20. \"Timeless\" by Kaytranada\nThere is no party playlist you could make that would be better than playing \"Timeless\" top to bottom. Across 21 songs, Kaytranada proves himself a top-notch curator of grooves, summoning the perfect cast of sidekicks for his mission \u2014 put simply, to make you dance dance dance dance \u2014 from Ravyn Lenae, Tinashe, and PinkPantheress to Channel Tres, Anderson .Paak, Childish Gambino, and Thundercat.\nBest songs: \"Drip Sweat,\" \"Do 2 Me,\" \"Witchy,\" \"Wasted Words,\" \"Snap My Finger\"\n19. \"Dark Times\" by Vince Staples\nBefore Kendrick Lamar surprise-dropped \"GNX,\" Vince Staples had hip-hop heads fully covered. The two rappers share an affinity for intellectual lyrics, an aptitude for tackling complex themes, and a history of critical acclaim \u2014 but where Lamar's music is at least somewhat motivated by commercial interests, Staples is unburdened by ego and expectations.\n\"No one's coming to me,\" he told Zane Lowe, \"looking for a single or looking for a party record, or things of that nature. I don't feel those pressures.\"\nStaples thrives in the album's brooding sonic landscape, which invites the listener to stay fully absorbed. Take 35 minutes to do nothing but listen.\nBest songs: \"Black&Blue,\" \"Shame on the Devil,\" \"\u00c9touff\u00e9e,\" \"'Radio,'\" \"Little Homies\"\n18. \"Prelude to Ecstasy\" by The Last Dinner Party\nThe Last Dinner Party's much-hyped debut album, \"Prelude to Ecstasy,\" over-delivers on the promise of excitement and novelty. Although several of its highlights were released ahead of time as singles, the album's in-between moments are the furthest thing from filler; each composition is lush and grandiose, never allowing for a dull moment. You may be tempted to accuse the British quintet of melodrama, but you get the feeling that's exactly what they were going for.\nBest songs: \"Burn Alive,\" \"The Feminine Urge,\" \"Beautiful Boy,\" \"Portrait of a Dead Girl,\" \"Nothing Matters\"\n17. \"Willson\" by Ashe\n\"Willson\" is Ashe's third full-length album, completing the trilogy that spells out her real name (Ashlyn Rae Willson), but it's her first as an independent artist.\nAfter canceling her global tour in 2023, Ashe decamped to Nashville, where she'd planted the seeds of her songwriting career. After a period of tending to her burnout and building a life with her now-fianc\u00e9, she was able to be creative again for creativity's sake. \"I painted the walls and renovated and gardened. I bought power tools and put up the wainscoting in the bathroom. I got dirt under my fingernails,\" she told Forbes. \"That was a huge part of separating myself from what my entire identity was wrapped up in, which was my career.\"\nAshe has always made music that breaks with trends and conventions, but with \"Willson,\" her unfettered approach is more apparent than ever. Throughout the album, she sings quite literally about liberation, autonomy, and shedding her people-pleasing tendencies, backed by spacious, soaring production that sounds as free as she feels.\nBest songs: \"Please Don't Fall In Love With Me,\" \"Running Out of Time,\" \"Cherry Trees,\" \"I Wanna Love You (But I Don't),\" \"Ashe\"\n16. \"Forever\" by Charly Bliss\nThe third studio album from New York-founded foursome Charly Bliss is the perfect musical sugar rush, packed with fizzy vocals and guitar riffs so candy-coated you'll mistake them for synths.\nCharly Bliss has often been described as \"bubblegrunge,\" earning high praise for their poppy takes on '90s indie-rock. \"Forever\" leans more bubble than grunge, echoing Taylor Swift's \"The Archer\" in the Jack Antonoff-approved standout \"Nineteen\" and often evoking Carly Rae Jepsen's beloved \"Emotion.\"\nBut make no mistake: Even as Charly Bliss' soundscape has evolved, their songwriting hasn't lost its Warped Tour-adjacent angst. \"I'm Not Dead\" yearns for a life with more fuck-ups and fulfillment (\"If I'm a rock star, I'm not doing it right\") while \"I Don't Know Anything\" is explicit about the harrowing realities of the music industry (\"You bet on yourself and you lose every day\"). But it's the deceptively upbeat single \"Back There Now\" that contains the album's spikiest turn of phrase: \"A boy like you would hang me if I gave you the rope.\"\nBest songs: \"Calling You Out,\" \"Back There Now,\" \"Nineteen,\" \"I'm Not Dead,\" \"I Don't Know Anything\"\n15. \"What a Devastating Turn of Events\" by Rachel Chinouriri\nRachel Chinouriri's disarming candor, empathy, and attentiveness come through loud and clear in her songwriting. Listening to her debut album, \"What a Devastating Turn of Events,\" you get the feeling that she walks around with her arms outstretched, ready to engage anyone in conversation.\nChinouriri's best songs are personal but rarely self-serving; she'll narrate tales about a lonely month she spent in Los Angeles (\"When you don't belong, the hills will know\") or a cousin in Zimbabwe who committed suicide after getting pregnant (\"Out of wedlock which her family despised / But if she lost it, it would still be a crime\") that double as meditations on racism and reproductive healthcare.\nBut not all of her songs are so heavy. Chinouriri is a proud student of Britpop (Blur, Oasis) and noughties indie-rock (Phoenix, Kings of Leon), though she filters her research through a modern feminine lens (Olivia Rodrigo, Lily Allen circa \"It's Not Me, It's You\"). \"What a Devastating Turn of Events\" strikes a tricky balance between being substantial, at times intense, and being downright fun to listen to.\nBest songs: \"Garden of Eden,\" \"The Hills,\" \"Never Need Me,\" \"All I Ever Asked,\" \"What a Devastating Turn of Events\"\n14. \"For Your Consideration\" by Empress Of\nLorely Rodriguez, known professionally as Empress Of, has collaborated with an array of indie-pop geniuses, from Blood Orange to Caroline Polachek to MUNA and toured with Carly Rae Jepsen and Maggie Rogers.\nIf you like any of those artists \u2014 or, better yet, all of them \u2014 you'll love Rodriguez's magnum opus, \"For Your Consideration.\" The compact 11-song tracklist sounds like someone put all the best experimental dance music and punchy synth-pop into a blender and sprinkled it with the essence of Rosal\u00eda's \"Motomami.\" The result is a treat that's jam-packed with flavor, made to be slurped and savored.\nBest songs: \"Preciosa,\" \"Femenine,\" \"Sucia,\" \"Baby Boy,\" \"What's Love\"\n13. \"Bright Future\" by Adrianne Lenker\n\"Bright Future,\" the sixth solo album by Adrianne Lenker (also known as the frontwoman for Big Thief), is at once haunting and comforting.\nLenker's singular brand of songwriting honors the traditions of folk music while breaking new ground, unfurling scenes of unrequited queer love (\"We could be friends / You could love me through and through / If I were him\") and the desire for a gentle, patient life (\"Do you wanna dance? / Sometimes I think I try too hard\") in her signature one-take warble.\nThere's a palpable melancholy in her reveries \u2014 an awareness that nothing is quite so easy or so pure \u2014 but still undeniable beauty in the hope of it all. \"I have so much nuance and complexity to what I need,\" Lenker told Crack Magazine, \"and I do not feel by any means I've wrapped my mind around it.\"\nBest songs: \"Sadness As a Gift,\" \"Fool,\" \"No Machine,\" \"Free Treasure,\" \"Vampire Empire\"\n12. \"Charm\" by Clairo\nClairo is doing her best Carole King on \"Charm,\" and she could take this role to the bank.\nMuch like King's seminal work, \"Tapestry,\" Clairo's third studio album is characterized by billowing warmth, a soundscape largely achieved with jazzy piano chords, woodwinds, and humble lyrics that capture basic truths of love, devotion, and heartache: \"It's second nature,\" \"You make me wanna go buy a new dress / You make me wanna slip off a new dress,\" \"Honey, was it enough? Is it ever enough?\"\nBest songs: \"Sexy to Someone,\" \"Second Nature,\" \"Terrapin,\" \"Juna,\" \"Add Up My Love\"\n11. \"Born In the Wild\" by Tems\nTems has already left her fingerprints across the pop landscape, whether listeners realize it or not. You may recognize her voice from Drake's \"Fountains,\" Future's \"Wait for U,\" Beyonc\u00e9's \"Move,\" or, most likely, Wizkid's \"Essence,\" which was nominated for a Grammy and became the first song by all Nigerian artists to reach the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nBut Tems was not destined to be a featured guest. Her first full-length album, \"Born in the Wild,\" makes it clear that her fate is musical royalty. (Prophetically, her parents named her Temilade, which means \"the crown is mine\" in Yoruba.)\n\"Born in the Wild\" pulls triple duty, showcasing Tems as a dynamic vocalist, producer, and, in the words of Boutayna Chokrane for Pitchfork, \"author of her own lore.\" Although the album carries traces of her forebears, from Lauryn Hill, Destiny's Child, and SZA to the reggae-fusion legend Diana King, whose \"L-L-Lies\" is interpolated in \"Gangsta,\" Tems is credited as the lead songwriter on all 18 tracks. Her voice and vision remain at the forefront.\nBest songs: \"Burning,\" \"Love Me JeJe,\" \"Ready,\" \"Boy O Boy,\" \"T-Unit\"\n10. \"The Great Impersonator\" by Halsey\nHalsey has long been devoted to concept albums, whether it's the Shakespearean fever dream of 2017's \"Hopeless Fountain Kingdom\" or the pregnancy-induced body horror of 2021's \"If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power.\"\nTheir latest album, \"The Great Impersonator,\" both cements and subverts their legacy as a shapeshifter. Across the 18-song tracklist, Halsey adopts different genres, tones, and impressions, but she constantly oscillates between fantasy and sincerity. On the opening track, \"Only Living Girl in LA,\" Halsey takes a cue from Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Only Living Boy in New York\" \u2014 written as a tender farewell to the duo's partnership \u2014 while cracking dark jokes about the crowd at her funeral. The PJ Harvey-inspired scorcher \"Dog Years\" draws a parallel between suicidal ideation and putting down her pet. \"Letter to God (1983)\" is a convincing Bruce Springsteen pastiche, which nearly distracts from the desperate pleas for divine intervention.\nOnly by trying on costumes, Halsey seems to suggest, can she feel safe enough to expose her most private fears and urges.\nThere's a sense of tragedy that pervades this practice, as well as the music itself. \"The Great Impersonator\" was written during a time of grave physical illness and familial upheaval, or, in Halsey's words, \"the space between life and death.\"\nHalsey confronts her catastrophes with emotions scaled to match. She is at turns furious, devastated, resentful, resigned, and wracked with guilt \u2014 both of the survivor's and mother's variety. \"I don't ever wanna leave him,\" she sings of her young son, Ender, \"but I don't think it's my choice.\"\nMore than anything, \"The Great Impersonator\" captures the never-enoughness of life itself. Halsey is doing everything, saying everything, feeling everything, because it might be their last chance \u2014 and isn't that the point?\nBest songs: \"Ego,\" \"Panic Attack,\" \"I Believe In Magic,\" \"Lonely Is the Muse,\" \"Arsonist\"\n9. \"What Now\" by Brittany Howard\nThanks to her rich timbre and multi-octave range, Brittany Howard's voice is immediately discernible, whatever style of rock 'n' roll she happens to be commanding that day.\nAs the frontwoman for Alabama Shakes, it was '60s-flavored Southern soul (\"Boys & Girls\") and psychedelia (\"Sound & Color\"). In her second solo album, Howard leans even deeper into her soul and funk instincts, swathed in fuzzy guitar licks and jazz-inflected brass arrangements. \"What Now\" reveals Howard at the peak of her powers, bending every instrument to her virtuosic will.\nBest songs: \"I Don't,\" \"What Now,\" \"Red Flags,\" \"Prove It To You,\" \"Power to Undo\"\n8. \"Short n' Sweet\" by Sabrina Carpenter\nSabrina Carpenter is a pop star with a capital P and a capital S. She knows exactly what she's doing, and this clarity of purpose and personality is what makes \"Short n' Sweet\" shine through 2024's deluge of pop albums.\nThese days, most of the top singer-songwriters follow the Taylor Swift Theory of Pop Music, believing they must be confessional and soul-bearing in order for their music to resonate with fans. Carpenter's sixth studio album (yes, sixth, though she considers it to be her second \"big girl\" album) offers a rebuttal.\nThat's not to say Carpenter isn't a skilled lyricist; Jack Antonoff, who produced much of \"Short n' Sweet,\" confirmed that Carpenter wrote every word in \"Sharpest Tool,\" the album's best song. She's just a different kind of lyricist, wielding humor, innuendo, and wordplay as many of her peers might wield their diaristic details.\nEven the most generalized, nonspecific songs in the tracklist, like the smash hit \"Espresso\" or the sexy standout \"Bed Chem,\" manage to feel sticky and memorable. Carpenter delivers each line with vocal flair and charisma, reshaping the broadest phrases to fit her specific persona. On paper, \"That's that me espresso\" could've been written by anyone, but now that we've heard the song, it could only make sense coming out of Carpenter's mouth.\nBest songs: \"Please Please Please,\" \"Sharpest Tool,\" \"Coincidence,\" \"Bed Chem,\" \"Espresso\"\n7. \"Imaginal Disk\" by Magdalena Bay\nMagdalena Bay is the indie-pop band that every music critic and chronically-online-cool-girl is obsessed with right now.\nIf you're not familiar with their surrealist TikTok account or the album cover that inspired Rosal\u00eda's Halloween costume, the band is actually just two people: Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin, both Miami natives with Argentinian-Jewish roots, who met in high school. They're a couple now, though some people mistakenly believe they're related. Think of it like The White Stripes for the digital age \u2014 if Jack and Meg White were listening to a lot of early Grimes and doom-scrolling on their phones.\n\"Imaginal Disk\" is the culmination of their 13-year partnership, the fruit of two true creatives who are perfectly in sync. The music is very much of the moment, full of distorted synths and anxious lyrics about \"divine digits,\" warped mirrors, and TV-induced nightmares \u2014 but, miraculously, it never strays into the realm of pretentious, patronizing slush. Tenenbaum and Lewin may be preoccupied with the splendors and ills of the modern world, but they're not preaching or speaking down to us because they are us.\nBest songs: \"Killing Time,\" \"Image,\" \"Death & Romance,\" \"Fear, Sex,\" \"That's My Floor\"\n6. \"Tyla\" by Tyla\nTyla's self-titled is the most impressive debut album of the year, parading an assortment of moods and genres \u2014 namely Afrobeats, amapiano, pop, and R&B \u2014 with the poise of a seasoned superstar.\nListening to \"Tyla,\" I can't help but remember how I felt listening to Rihanna's \"Music of the Sun\" in 2005, that flutter in my stomach when I knew something big was about to happen \u2014 or, more accurately, someone.\nLike most great pop albums, \"Tyla\" is accessible and versatile with a song for every mood. \"Water\" may be her \"Pon de Replay,\" but she's also got her independent-girl anthem (\"No.1\"), her timeless love song (\"Butterflies\"), her heartbreak memento (\"To Last\"), and, of course, her party-starters (\"Jump,\" \"On My Body\"). Through it all, Tyla never sacrifices her signature sound for the sake of mass appeal.\nBest songs: \"Truth Or Dare,\" \"Butterflies,\" \"On and On,\" \"Jump,\" \"To Last\"\n5. \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" by Taylor Swift\nTaylor Swift as a concept looms large over her 11th studio album \u2014 so much so that it was summarily dismissed by people who've grown tired of \"her whole thing.\" As Swiftian history shows us, this fatigue happens cyclically every few years.\nBut as Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield wrote in \"Heartbreak is the National Anthem,\" his new book about Swift's place in music history, \"Many people often find Taylor infuriating and exhausting. So does Taylor Swift.\"\nThat may as well be the thesis for \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" At 31 songs, the album is instantly overwhelming. It's self-effacing and self-aware to a truly comical degree. (I will never forget where I was when I first heard Swift sing, \"I'm having his baby. No, I'm not! But you should see your faces.\") It's full of heel turns, hallucinations, and contradictions. She pledges, \"I can fix him,\" then ends the same song with, \"Woah! Maybe I can't.\" Later, she swears she'll forget him \u2014 in a song that also swears he's a swindler who deserves jail time. She begs God to send her a soulmate, but three tracks later, she compares the sensation of leaving a man to emerging from a frozen lake. In the album's lead single, she literally casts herself as an asylum patient.\nAs Sheffield notes, \"There's something scary about all her try-try-try energy, but that's the only possible way she could write songs like these.\" Swift is always erupting, never walking it back, and never playing it cool. It's annoying. It's relatable. It's annoyingly relatable. But for her fellow triers, it's sheer magic. It's a crucial part of her allure as an artist, and it's also what makes the \"The Tortured Poets Department\" \u2014 yes, even the extra 15 songs \u2014 such a damned, accursed thrill.\nBest songs: \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" \"Guilty as Sin?,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" \"Loml,\" \"The Black Dog,\" \"How Did It End?,\" \"The Prophecy\"\n4. \"Submarine\" by The Mar\u00edas\nOne year after The Mar\u00edas released their debut album, 2021's \"Cinema,\" the band reached a watershed moment: They were featured on Bad Bunny's 2022 blockbuster \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" Their duet, \"Otro Atardecer,\" has over 481 million streams on Spotify to date.\nBad Bunny's cosign promised more ears and a much bigger platform; a well-executed sophomore album could change their trajectory forever. It seemed the stars had aligned.\nIn reality, their path forward wasn't promised. Lead singer Mar\u00eda Zardoya and drummer and producer Josh Conway, the duo that founded the band and cowrote the songs, broke up. They'd begun dating shortly after meeting, drawn together by their artistic chemistry. Dousing that spark could've spelled the end of The Mar\u00edas.\nTo avoid this fate, the bandmates had the wisdom to impose a six-week sabbatical \u2014 the longest they'd been apart in their eight years of knowing each other, Zardoya told Elle. They both took the time to travel. \"We were in our 'Eat, Pray, Love' era for sure,\" she said. \"The isolation was necessary for us to heal, then come together and make this project. We overcame a lot to make it happen.\"\n\"Submarine\" may be the best album written by actively splitting lovers since Fleetwood Mac's \"Rumours,\" though The Mar\u00edas' version is markedly more serene. Zardoya swaps the righteous fury of Stevie Nicks for soothing melodies and abiding tenderness, sounding more like Selena mixed with Sade. Conway compliments his ex's hushed vocals with glinting synths and waves of reverb.\nThe effect is all-encompassing, fluid, almost reverent \u2014 quite like sitting at the bottom of a pool, watching the sunlight glitter on the surface, as Zardoya does in the cover art. There isn't a single dissonant moment or skippable song to pull you out of its depths.\nBest songs: \"Echo,\" \"Run Your Mouth,\" \"Blur,\" \"No One Noticed,\" \"Vicious Sensitive Robot\"\n3. \"Hit Me Hard and Soft\" by Billie Eilish\n\"Hit Me Hard and Soft\" is Billie Eilish's third studio album and her best yet by far. Compared to the lonely visions of 2019's \"When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\" or the self-indulgent soliloquies of 2021's \"Happier Than Ever,\" this world feels richer, more curious and expansive.\nAlthough the tracklist only has 10 songs, every chord, every ad-lib, and every transition has been carefully considered as part of a whole. String motifs and key lyrics resurface across the album, and the eerie and reflective closing track, \"Blue,\" fuses two scrapped songs from Eilish's past into something new.\nEilish's brother and collaborator Finneas O'Connell once described this album as containing \"real ghosts\" because they resurrected old material. This may explain why its centerpiece, \"Chihiro,\" shares a name with the protagonist of \"Spirited Away,\" a movie about stumbling through a portal to an alternate dimension that's full of strange monsters and spirits. Chihiro is thrust into a great adventure at an extremely young age \u2014 much like Eilish when she shot to fame as a teenager. Her only options are escape or immersion.\nEilish's previous albums ooze with the itch to escape. In \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" Eilish finally chooses the latter.\nBest songs: \"Chihiro,\" \"Birds of a Feather,\" \"The Greatest,\" \"The Diner,\" \"Blue\"\n2. \"Brat\" by Charli XCX\nThe \"best\" album of the year is always debatable, but one thing is for sure: \"Brat\" will go down in history as the main character in 2024's cultural discourse.\nThe artwork's acid green seeped into every corner of observable life, from statue gardens and brand campaigns to Times Square and the White House. Even NASA hopped on the trend, using \"Brat\" lyrics in an Instagram caption to describe the lingering glow of a supernova. \"Buried at the center is the star's tell-tale heart,\" the agency wrote, \"which beats with rhythmic precision.\" How very fitting.\nAfter many years of languishing in pop's middle class (justice for \"How I'm Feeling Now\"), Charli XCX broke into the mainstream with her most idiosyncratic work to date. Ironically, it was her previous effort, 2022's \"Crash,\" that was created with the intention of showing off her pop-star chops \u2014 both as a cynical stunt and an earnest bid for attention.\nAt the time, the experiment seemed to fail. \"Crash\" was well received by critics but failed to lift Charli into pop's upper echelon.\nAnd yet, it was precisely this kind of failure \u2014 or, at least, the perception of failure in the competitive world of \"stan Twitter\" \u2014 that made the existence of \"Brat\" possible. Throughout the tracklist, Charli is haunted by her own legacy. She frets constantly about being compared to other women in the industry. Do they even notice when she's fixing her hair or snagging her tights? Do they see her standing in the background? Do they also wish they could rewind to simpler times, before they cared about Billboard charts and sales numbers? She even wonders whether her music career is worth putting her personal life on hold for.\nEven when Charli is playing her familiar role, the \"365 party girl,\" her brags are still legacy-oriented. \"I'm your favorite reference, baby,\" she insists in the opening track, \"360.\" In the standout single \"Von Dutch,\" she teases, \"It's OK to just admit that you're jealous of me.\" Put in conversation with the album's deep cuts, these lyrics seem more defensive than they do at first brush. Charli is ready to call herself an icon, but she wants you to say it back.\n\"Brat\" is a uniquely Charli album, but as NASA accidentally noted, it's also a tale as old as time: Buried at the center, beneath the neon lights and pulsing synths, Charli's tell-tale heart is beating, keeping her alive, begging to be heard.\nBest songs: \"Sympathy Is a Knife,\" \"Von Dutch,\" \"So I,\" \"Girl, So Confusing,\" \"365\"\n1. \"Cowboy Carter\" by Beyonc\u00e9\n\"Brat Summer\" may have taken over the online lexicon in 2024, but once again, it was Beyonc\u00e9 who made the most technically impressive and thematically effective album of the year.\nFollowing the footsteps of \"Renaissance,\" the best album of 2022, \"Cowboy Carter\" is part of an ongoing trilogy that probes the limits of genre \u2014 and, crucially, the roles that race and gender play in imposing those limits. Beyonc\u00e9 is the perfect and perhaps only musician alive who could stage such an experiment with this level of mastery, foresight, and cultural impact.\nYou could pinpoint pretty much any three-track run on \"Cowboy Carter,\" and you'd find proof why it's the album of the year. Take \"Ameriican Reqiuem,\" a mini-dissertation on prejudice in the music industry, then \"Blackbiird,\" an illuminating blend of young Black voices in country music with a classic-rock song that was inspired by the Little Rock Nine, topped by \"16 Carriages,\" a soulful ballad that draws from Beyonc\u00e9's outlaw-esque roots, and you've still only covered the first 11-ish minutes.\nBeyonc\u00e9 has many musical gifts, including (but not limited to) identifying fresh talent, reinventing samples, fine-tuning even the tiniest details, and synthesizing many themes and perspectives to form one coherent narrative. Her range is already well established, but on \"Cowboy Carter,\" each of these skills is deployed to its fullest extent.\nThe album opens with a pointed set of questions: \"Can you hear me? Or do you fear me?\" But Beyonc\u00e9 knows the breadth of her power, so she already knows what the answer will be. She closes the album by asking again, but this time, it's tinted by the shadow of a smirk: \"Tell me, can you hear me now?\"\nBest songs: \"Ameriican Reqiuem,\" \"Bodyguard,\" \"Daughter,\" \"Alliigator Tears,\" \"II Most Wanted,\" \"Ya Ya,\" \"II Hands II Heaven,\" \"Sweet Honey Buckiin'\""

      "text": "- Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been dating since the summer of 2023.\n- The pop star and athlete, both 35, have gushed about each other in interviews.\n- Swift recently made her debut appearance on Kelce's Instagram page.\nWe'll take a wild guess and say that Travis Kelce's favorite track from Taylor Swift's \"Midnights\" might be \"Mastermind.\"\nShortly after he turned up to the Eras Tour with a friendship bracelet and a dream, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end began dating the multi-Grammy-winning superstar.\nKelce, 35, laid the groundwork in the summer of 2023. He made his feelings known for Swift, 35, after he failed to get some one-on-one time when she performed on his home turf in Missouri. Soon, all the dominoes cascaded in a line: Swift began attending NFL games, openly cheering for the Chiefs, and stepping out with Kelce for date nights in New York City.\nHere's a complete timeline of their relationship so far.\nJuly 8, 2023: Kelce attends Swift's Eras Tour show stop in Kansas City.\nKelce officially entered his Swiftie era when he attended the second of the \"Anti-Hero\" singer's two performances on his home turf.\nBefore the concert at Arrowhead Stadium, Kelce was seen chatting with other Swifties and even trading friendship bracelets, according to a video posted on X (formerly Twitter).\nJuly 26, 2023: A few weeks later, Kelce says on his podcast that he wanted to give Swift his number at the show.\nSpeaking on his podcast, \"New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce,\" the athlete said he was \"butt hurt\" because he couldn't give Swift a friendship bracelet (a tradition among Swift's concertgoers) that included his phone number.\n\"I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\" Kelce told his brother and cohost, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce.\nJason then asked which number he put on the bracelet \u2014 the number on his Kansas City Chiefs jersey (87) or his phone number.\n\"You know which one,\" Travis responded. He also quipped that while Swift \"doesn't meet anybody\" before her shows, he \"took it personal.\"\nAccording to Swift, she and Kelce began dating \"right after\" the podcast episode aired.\nIn an interview with Time magazine, Swift confirmed her relationship with Kelce and offered details about the beginning of their romance.\n\"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" she said. \"We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.\"\nSeptember 21, 2023: Kelce says he's \"thrown the ball in her court\" and invites Swift to one of his football games.\nTwo months after his podcast episode, Kelce told ESPN's Pat McAfee that after trying to woo the Grammy winner with a friendship bracelet, he extended an invite to one of his upcoming games.\n\"I told her, 'I've seen you rock the stage at Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead and see which one's a little more lit,'\" Kelce said in the interview.\n\"So we'll see what happens in the near future,\" he added.\nSeptember 24, 2023: Swift attends the Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears three days later.\nSwift sent the internet into meltdown when she accepted to Kelce's invitation. However, according to Swift, the lovebirds were already official by the time she attended her first game on September 24.\n\"By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,\" she told Time. \"I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\"\nOn that fated day, Swift was photographed wearing Kansas City colors as she watched the game from Kelce's private suite, alongside his mom, Donna Kelce.\nWhen Kelce \u2014 already considered one of the best tight ends in NFL history \u2014 hauled in a touchdown pass from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the third quarter, Swift rose to her feet and cheered.\nAfter chest-bumping with another spectator in the box, the singer appeared to shout, \"Let's fucking go!\" as Mama Kelce smiled and applauded.\nAfter the game, images of Kelce and Swift walking out of the stadium together and driving off in his old-school convertible car were shared on X.\nThe pair ended their night at Prime Social Rooftop, which Kelce rented out for Swift, his family, and his teammates, per Entertainment Tonight. In photos obtained by TMZ, the couple wasn't shy about showing their affection for each other as Swift was seen wrapping her arm around Kelce's neck as they chatted with other partygoers.\nIn the days following, an anonymous source told People that Kelce and Swift had been \"hanging out\" and were still in the \"super, super early days\" of getting to know each other.\n\"They're having fun,\" the source told the outlet. \"This was Taylor's first time meeting his mom and dad, and everyone was enjoying themselves.\"\nMeanwhile, Kelce debriefed the Swift-inspired frenzy on his podcast.

I think it brings a little more to the atmosphere, brings a little bit more to what you're watching,\" Kelce said.\n\"But at the same time, I think they're overdoing it a little bit,\" he continued.\nNBC Sports, which aired the game, frequently cut to shots of Swift cheering on the Chiefs. The NFL also briefly changed its bios on Instagram and X to reference Swift after the Chiefs beat the Jets.\nIn response, the NFL defended its coverage of the pair in a statement obtained by ESPN.\nOctober 5, 2023: Kelce celebrates his 34th birthday. Swift reportedly flies to Missouri to spend the weekend with him.\nAccording to multiple outlets, the \"Fearless\" singer spent a few days with Kelce following his 34th birthday.\nUs Weekly, Page Six, and the Daily Mail reported that Swift flew from her home in Nashville, Tennessee to Kansas City, Missouri the day after his birthday.\nThe two were not seen out together, and an anonymous source told Us Weekly that the pair chose to have a \"chill night\" together. It's unknown when Swift left, but she was not present at the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Minnesota Vikings the following Sunday.\nOctober 12, 2023: Swift shows up to her third Chiefs game, one day after premiering \"The Eras Tour\" movie.\nThe \"Cruel Summer\" singer returned to the Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on Kelce as his team took on the Denver Broncos.\nIn a video shared by People, Swift was seen wearing a Chiefs-branded jacket for the game, where she caught up with Kelce's parents in the family suite.

But there's another end of it where it's like, 'Man, this is a lot.'\"\n\"This is another level of stardom that typically football players don't deal with,\" he added.\nOctober 24, 2023: Kelce's dad praises Swift as \"smart\" and \"genuine.\"\nIn an interview with People, Ed Kelce described Swift as \"a very, very sweet, very charming, down-to-earth young woman.\"\nThe athlete's father also praised her first impression as \"very genuine,\" presumably referring to the Chiefs game on October 12, when Swift and Ed were seen chatting in the stands.\n\"I'll tell you something very special that I noticed about Taylor the first time I met her,\" Ed shared. \"We're sitting in the suite, she gets up and in the front room, she gets up to go get a drink or something and she starts picking up empty bottles, cans, plates that are scattered around. Because in the suites everybody gets stuff and you empty it down wherever you can.\"\n\"And I'm just thinking, I don't think she got the diva memo. She didn't get the spoiled musician,\" he continued. \"She doesn't know how to pull that off. And that really to me said a whole lot.\"\nNovember 3, 2023: Kelce responds with a smile when asked if he's \"in love\" with Swift.\nAt a press conference in Frankfurt, Germany, where the Kansas City Chiefs would soon play the Miami Dolphins, Kelce fielded a direct question about his feelings for Swift.\nAccording to ESPN's NFL reporter Jeff Darlington, the reporter asked, \"What is the latest status, and are you in love?\"\n\"I got to see her last week.

Magazine, the NFL player said he was a Swiftie before he began dating the pop star.\nHe praised Swift's songwriting, especially her song \"Blank Space,\" and even described his girlfriend as \"a genius.\"\n\"I've never been a man of words,\" Kelce said. \"Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been fucking mind-blowing.

And we're just proud of each other.\"\nJanuary 26, 2024: Kelce says he and Swift are happy to ignore the \"outside noise.\"\nDuring a Chiefs press conference, Kelce fielded questions about navigating his relationship amid his growing fame.\n\"As long as we're happy, we can't listen to anything that's outside noise,\" Kelce said. \"That's all that matters.\"\nKelce added that he'd be \"silly\" to deny Swift's role in his growing fan base, but his priority is still his job.\n\"I brought this upon myself, and I do enjoy having fun with it all, and the biggest thing is making sure my focus is right here in this building,\" Kelce told reporters.\nJanuary 28, 2024: Swift celebrates with Kelce when the Chiefs secure their spot in the Super Bowl.\nFor her 12th NFL appearance, Swift watched the Chiefs beat the Baltimore Ravens to secure their spot in Super Bowl LVIII.\nAfter the game, she joined Kelce and his family on the field to celebrate. The couple shared several hugs and kisses in front of the crowd.\nFebruary 11, 2024: Swift joins Kelce on the field after he wins the Super Bowl.\nAt the 2024 Super Bowl, Kelce and the Chiefs became NFL champions for the second year in a row.

Swift also wore a \"New Heights\" hat to support Kelce's podcast.\nKelce later said that he prefers to watch concerts \"from the fans' perspective.\"\n\"I'm a fan of the music. I'm a fan of live shows,\" Kelce said on his podcast. \"I want to see it from the front of the stage. Yeah, we probably could've finessed it that way [watching backstage], but I think it's just that much more of an experience if you're in the pit, man. If you're in the madness with all the fans. It was awesome though.\"\nApril 19, 2024: Swift releases her new album \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" which may include a nod to Kelce.\nSwift's 31-track double album \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" contains two songs that may nod to Kelce.\nThe first is \"The Alchemy,\" which doubles as a love song and an ode to Swift's enduring career. The lyrics feature several sport-related metaphors like \"Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team\" and \"Where's the trophy? He just comes running over to me.\"\nAccording to the liner notes, \"The Alchemy\" was copyrighted in 2023, so it's unclear how deeply tied to Kelce it can be. (Swift's albums are typically finished several months ahead of their release date, ensuring vinyl factories have enough time to fulfill preorders.)\nHowever, \"So High School,\" which also seemingly references Kelce, was released in the deluxe half of \"TTPD,\" meaning it wasn't included with physical copies of the album. A song can be made available to stream almost immediately after completion, so it's possible the song was written more recently.\n\"So High School\" is perhaps the only straightforward love song on \"Poets,\" depicting a relationship that transports Swift back to her \"You Belong With Me\" days \u2014 the giddy rush of young love and lust.\nThe track appears to include direct references to Kelce, including \"You know how to ball, I know Aristotle,\" \"You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her,\" and \"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?\"\nBack in 2016, Kelce played a game of \"Kiss, Marry, Kill\" with AfterBuzz TV, in which he chose to kiss Swift.\nApril 27, 2024: Kelce calls Swift his \"significant other\" at a charity gala.\nKelce brought Swift as his date to the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Golf Classic gala in Las Vegas.\nIn a highlights reel shared by Kelce's teammate, the couple can be seen walking into the event holding hands.\nOther clips shared by fans at the event show Kelce and Swift cuddling and kissing at their table.

Kelce, who wears No. 87 for the Chiefs, was in the audience. Kelce was spotted dancing with Swift's close friend, Gigi Hadid, and filming Swift on his iPhone.\n\"Can you believe it's our 87th show tonight?\" Swift asked the audience during her acoustic set, just before playing \"The Alchemy\" and \"Begin Again\" as the evening's surprise songs.\nDuring the concert's \"1989\" segment, Swift also debuted a new outfit: a glittering yellow top with a red ombr\u00e9 skirt. Fans interpreted this as a nod to Kelce and the Chiefs because the team's colors are yellow and red. (Kelce previously said his favorite song of Swift's is \"Blank Space\" from \"1989\").\nFinally, to close the evening, Swift tweaked the lyrics of \"Karma\" to salute \"the guy on the Chiefs\" for the second time.\nJune 23, 2024: Kelce makes his debut appearance on The Eras Tour stage.\nDuring Swift's third and final performance in London, Kelce made a surprise appearance during her onstage costume change for \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\nThis scene depicts Swift getting shot and killed at the end of \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.\" Then, she's picked up and revived by a set of dancers dressed as ringmasters. These characters force Swift to strip down, put on heels, and keep performing through the pain \u2014 a segue into her meta bop (and \"TTPD\" album highlight) \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\"\nKelce joined the skit as another ringmaster. He picked up Swift's body from the stage, carried her to the fainting couch, and mimed applying powder to her face with a makeup brush.\nKelce is now cemented in Swiftian history as the first boyfriend to join Swift onstage during one of her concerts.\nSeptember 7, 2024: Swift brings Kelce as her date to a friend's wedding.\nSwift and Kelce were spotted out together in New York City, where they attended the wedding of Karen Elson and Lee Foster, per Vogue.\nElson is a model, while Foster is the owner of Electric Lady Studios, where Swift has recorded many songs over the years \u2014 from \"Lover\" to \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\nSwift wore a cream-colored floral dress for the occasion, paired with a Vivienne Westwood purse, Louboutin sandals, and $64,000 worth of jewelry.\nSeptember 8, 2024: The couple attends the US Open together.\nDuring an extended break from the Eras Tour, Swift and Kelce attended the 2024 US Open Tennis Championships, where they were photographed cuddling, kissing, and singing along to \"I Believe In a Thing Called Love\" by The Darkness. They even wore color-coordinating outfits.\nThe couple was joined by friends like Brittany Mahomes and the Haim sisters.\nSeptember 11, 2024: Swift gives a shout-out to \"my boyfriend Travis\" at the VMAs.\nSwift's \"Fortnight\" won video of the year at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards. During her acceptance speech, she described her joyful experience filming (and directing) the video.\n\"Something that I'll always remember is when I finished a take and I'd say 'cut,' and we'd be done with that take, I would always hear someone cheering from across the studio where we were shooting it,\" she said. \"That one person was my boyfriend, Travis.\"\nAfter an eruption of applause, Swift continued to thank Kelce for his positive attitude.\n\"Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic,\" she said. \"So I want to thank him for adding that to our shoot because I'll always remember that.\"\nOctober 7, 2024: After skipping a few games, Swift makes a stylish return to Arrowhead Stadium.\nDespite recent tabloid speculation about their relationship status, Swift showed up to cheer for Kelce when the Chiefs took on the New Orleans Saints.\nSwift wore a Vivienne Westwood set and glitter freckles for the occasion in Kansas City, where the Chiefs won their fifth consecutive game and extended their undefeated season.\nJanuary 26, 2025: Once again, Swift celebrates on the field when the Chiefs win the AFC championship.\nFor the second year in a row, Swift watched the Chiefs become AFC champions at Arrowhead Stadium \u2014 her ninth attendance of the season and 22nd total. She joined Kelce and his team for the on-field celebrations.\nFebruary 9, 2025: Swift supports Kelce at Super Bowl LIX.\nSwift traveled to New Orleans to cheer for Kelce at their second Super Bowl as a couple.\nEarlier that week, the couple was spotted dining with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes at Lilette, a popular French restaurant in the city.

      "text": "- We're living in the era of musicians raised by Taylor Swift.\n- Gayle, Maisie Peters, Baby Queen, and Gus Dapperton told BI about her impact on their songwriting.\n- Stars like Sabrina Carpenter, Olivia Rodrigo, and Troye Sivan also count Swift as an influence.\nSabrina Carpenter said working with Swift is \"a childhood dream come true.\"\nBack when Carpenter was 9 years old, still years away from becoming a Disney Channel star, she uploaded a video of herself singing Swift's country hit \"Picture to Burn\" on YouTube.\nNow, at 24 years old, Carpenter said she thinks of Swift as an \"older sister\" after opening for her monumental Eras Tour, playing international shows from Mexico City to Melbourne.\n\"That is one of my main inspirations ever since I was a little girl,\" Carpenter also told Billboard of Swift. \"Watching her in and of itself is how you learn. I admire her work ethic and her talent and she's just so amazing.\"\nGayle was greatly influenced by \"Picture to Burn\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble.\"\nGayle, 19, shot to fame with her viral hit \"Abcdefu\" and earned a Grammy nomination for song of the year.\nDuring a 2023 interview with Business Insider, she reminisced about growing up with Swift's \"iconic\" songs, specifically citing \"Picture to Burn,\" which was released when Gayle was just 2 years old.\n\"Some of her music videos when I was younger, she looked like a fairy princess to me,\" Gayle said. \"Oh my gosh, she is, wow. Just fangirling here.\"\nThe singer-songwriter also said Swift's hit single \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" is associated with one \"very big core memory\" after watching the music video \"every day\" at summer camp.\nTaking notes from Swift's hit songs eventually led to a cosign from Swift herself; Gayle joined The Eras Tour last year as a supporting act, opening several shows ahead of Paramore and Haim.\nGracie Abrams described Swift as \"one of the blueprints for vulnerability as a young woman.\"\nAbrams, a longtime admirer of Swift, recently began working with the superstar's \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore\" collaborator Aaron Dessner. She has repeatedly covered Swift's songs, including \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" from \"Midnights\" and the revered 10-minute version of \"All Too Well.\"\n\"I just respect the shit out of her with everything that she does,\" the 23-year-old singer-songwriter told Teen Vogue. \"I've always been so inspired at every stage of my life as a fan of hers.\"\nIn fact, the respect is mutual. Abrams appeared as the opening act for dozens of stops on The Eras Tour, and in 2021, Swift publicly praised Abrams' haunting single \"Rockland.\"\n\"I definitely don't believe that happened. I had a crazy physical reaction,\" Abrams said of the praise. \"I don't know how to operate, or function ever again. But I'm her biggest fan. Everything that she does is fucking unbelievably inspiring, motivating, it makes me want to do better and be the best version of myself as a writer and a person.\"\nAbrams will return to The Eras Tour stage when Swift returns for the second North American leg this year, playing a string of shows in New Orleans, Toronto, and more.\nPhoebe Bridgers praised Swift as \"an incredible businessperson and an incredible writer.\"\nBridgers, who was also tapped to open for Swift on The Eras Tour, said it was a \"dream\" to collaborate on \"Nothing New,\" one of the vault tracks released on \"Red (Taylor's Version).\"\n\"I just am so excited to have people take it at face value the day that it comes out, because I got teary recording it. I just couldn't be more excited,\" she told Billboard last October.\n\"She is an incredible businessperson and an incredible writer,\" Bridgers continued. \"What she's been able to build just from writing adeptly from a young age is insane.\"\nUpon the song's release, the 28-year-old Grammy nominee took to Twitter to express her gratitude and disbelief.\n\"I was 18 when red came out,\" she wrote. \"How is this real.\"\nMaisie Peters has described herself as \"the biggest Swiftie ever.\"\nPeters, 23, told BI that Swift is \"formative to everything I make.\"\n\"I remember listening to 'Back to December' for the first time and just being like, 'This is incredible,'\" Peters said.\nAsked if it gets tiresome to field questions about being a Swiftie, Peters responded with a definitive, \"No.\"\n\"With somebody like Taylor, there's so much you can draw on,\" she continued. \"She's so inspiring in so many different aspects of what she's done. So I'm here to talk about Taylor Swift all day.\"\nAlthough said she Peters hadn't met her idol just yet, she did sign to Gingerbread Man Records, the label run by noted Swift pal Ed Sheeran. He also cowrote three songs on her debut album, \"You Signed Up for This.\"\n\"I've never met Taylor Swift and everyone always goes, 'Oh aren't you so excited?' And I am so excited, but also it's going to be crazy because she's been so important to my life that it's sort of like meeting an otherworldly being,\" Peters said.\nBaby Queen was inspired to pursue a career in music after seeing the \"Love Story\" music video.\n\"I just decided from the age of 12 after discovering Taylor Swift,\" Baby Queen told BI. \"I was like, 'This is what I'm doing.'\"\nThe pop-rocker, 26, whose birth name is Bella Latham, also revealed that her brutally honest single \"These Drugs\" was partially inspired by Swift \u2014 namely the gut-punch bridge, a craft that Swift is famous for mastering.\n\"It's like where you put all the emotions, what Taylor does. She puts all the emotions into the bridge,\" she said. \"You hear the story and then the bridge comes and it's like, 'OK, I know Taylor's going to shoot me through the heart and she's going to kill me.'\"\nGus Dapperton has also cited \"Love Story\" as a major influence.\nDapperton, 27, told BI that his music is heavily inspired by artists like Odd Future and King Krule \u2014 fellow skater kids who had \"weird voices\" and no inhibitions \u2014 as well as supermassive stars like Britney Spears and Swift.\n\"When I hear my sister sing those big pop songs, it's impossible to deny how beautiful they sound,\" he said. \"My family would all be in the car chanting Taylor Swift songs and stuff. I think 'Love Story' by Taylor Swift is one of my favorite songs of all time. My dad would just turn up the volume as loud as possible.\"\n\"That's why I never denied the pleasures of pop music growing up,\" he added.\nTroye Sivan has long been inspired by Swift's songwriting prowess.\nSivan has been naming Swift as his ideal cowriter since 2016.\n\"I really, really, really want to write with Taylor Swift,\" he told Billboard. \"I'm sure that everyone would say that, but for me\u2026 as a student of pop music, I feel like I have so much that I could learn from her.\"\nTwo years later, when asked about his \"dream duet partner,\" Sivan said Swift again, joking that he \"may as well reach for the stars.\"\n\"We [already] performed live,\" he told Variety, referring to his cameo appearance on her \"Reputation\" tour in 2018. \"I admire her so much as a writer. So even if we didn't duet and we just wrote together, I would be totally into that idea \u2014 so I could watch her work. She's a master of pop.\"\nMore recently, the 27-year-old pop star listed \"This Is Me Trying,\" \"You Are In Love,\" and \"Clean\" as his top three favorite songs by Swift.\n\"When she hits that stride, I get so jealous, and I just want to listen to the song over and over and over again,\" he told Jared Frieder for Interview magazine. \"I'm always like, 'Damn, Taylor Swift is so good.'\"\nClairo said she \"cried uncontrollably\" when she met Swift.\nClairo, 25, managed to team up with Swift's longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff to create her 2021 album \"Sling.\" However, the year prior, she was \"shocked\" when Swift initiated contact with her at the 2020 NME Awards.\n\"I crouched down with her, so we were both on the floor talking to each other,\" the celebrated indie songwriter later told NME. \"It looked so ridiculous. No one could talk to me after that happened, I was crying so much.\"\nIndeed, the year before their meeting, Clairo had made a bold declaration on Twitter: \"I would let taylor swift punch me any day.\"\nAccording to Conan Gray, Swift \"raised an entire generation of songwriters.\"\nBack in 2020, Swift shared Gray's debut album \"Kid Krow\" on her Instagram story, praising the track \"Wish You Were Sober\" as a \"masterpiece.\"\nThe duo's mutual respect is so well-documented that Swift enlisted Gray, 25, to help promote the release of her first rerecorded album, \"Fearless (Taylor's Version),\" in 2021.\n\"I've never met her, but she's been kind to me,\" Gray later told GQ. \"Taylor raised an entire generation of songwriters. She taught a lot of people how to write pop songs.\"\nThe \"Superache\" singer also revealed that \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was the first song he heard by Swift that changed his outlook on songwriting.\n\"It was one of the first YouTube videos I ever watched too. I remember that day so vividly,\" Gray said. \"My family had one computer that we all would use and I remember we all huddled around it and watched together. I remember thinking, 'Wow, Taylor Swift is the coolest person on the earth.'\"\nOlivia Rodrigo hailed Swift as her \"all-time idol\" and \"the best storyteller of our generation.\"\nThese days, Olivia Rodrigo, 21, is taking more cues from rockers like No Doubt, The Breeders, and The White Stripes.\nBut during her breakneck rise to fame, Rodrigo gushed about Swift on countless occasions and even sampled Swift's music on her acclaimed debut album \"Sour.\"\nRodrigo also received a \"really sweet\" handwritten letter from her idol after the success of her single \"Drivers License.\"\n\"I don't want to divulge too much because it's really sweet and personal,\" Rodrigo told Billboard.\n\"But she talks a lot about how, I think, you make your own luck in the world. And when you do kind things to others, good things come your way,\" she added.\nIndeed, Rodrigo has already taken some of Swift's career advice: She previously told The Guardian that she has retained control of her master recordings because she was inspired by Swift's public battle to own her music.\nGriff said there's \"a new wave of young pop musicians\" that evoke Swift in their songwriting.\n\"She's probably one of the No. 1 people that I look up to in terms of being a songwriter and being a top female in the music industry and being so consistent and coming back, time after time after time, with incredible songs,\" Griff, 23, told Nylon. \"I even said that to her.\"\nGriff met her hero at the 2021 Brit Awards, where she received the annual rising star award and performed her single \"Black Hole.\"\n\"Taylor sent flowers, which was really nice. And we got to hang out after the show in her dressing room, so that was pretty crazy,\" she told Billboard.\nGriff also told Harpers Bazaar that Swift gave her advice about handling the \"pressures of industry and business and writing my next album \u2014 just [to] take my time and do it on my own terms.\"\nSwift even gave Griff a shout-out when she accepted the global icon award that evening. More recently, Swift shared Griff's song \"Vertigo\" on Instagram, writing, \"I love this one.\""

      "text": "- Taylor Swift's newest album \"The Tortured Poets Department\" has returned to No. 1 for a 17th week.\n- \"Poets\" is her biggest album ever on the Billboard 200 chart, outlasting \"1989\" and \"Fearless.\"\n- Swift's self-titled debut album performed the worst on the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 5.\nTaylor Swift gave us fair warning in her newest album: \"Try and come for my job.\" Over three months later, she's still in her self-described \"glittering prime.\"\nReleased on April 19, \"The Tortured Poets Department\" logged 12 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, a career-best for Swift.\nThe uninterrupted reign of \"Poets\" is rare for a streaming-era release. It's the first album ever by a female artist to spend its first 12 weeks atop the chart, surpassing a record previously held by Whitney Houston's 1987 blockbuster \"Whitney.\" The all-time record for a consecutive streak among women is held by Carole King's masterpiece \"Tapestry,\" which spent 15 weeks at No. 1 in 1971.\nAfter briefly dropping to a lower position, \"Poets\" returned to No. 1 for five additional weeks, extending her personal record.\nSwift is no stranger to chart success. Keep reading for a ranking of her 15 studio albums (including both originals and rerecords) based on their Billboard 200 performances.\n9. \"Taylor Swift\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 5\nSwift's self-titled debut is the only studio album in her catalog that hasn't reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\"Taylor Swift\" debuted at No. 19 and scaled the chart for more than a year, peaking at No. 5 in 2008.\n8 (tie). \"Lover\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for one week\nSwift's seventh studio album was the first one that she owned outright, thanks to her new label contract with UMG.\n\"Lover\" was promoted by several singles, including \"You Need to Calm Down,\" \"The Archer,\" and \"The Man.\" Four years later, once Swift kicked off The Eras Tour, \"Cruel Summer\" climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed there for four weeks, becoming the album's biggest hit.\n8 (tie). \"Red (Taylor's Version)\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for one week\nThe extended tracklist for \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" included the storied 10-minute version of \"All Too Well,\" a longtime fan-favorite song in Swift's catalog.\n\"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" was released alongside a short film directed by Swift and promoted by a convention-breaking performance on \"Saturday Night Live.\" It became the longest song to reach No. 1 in the history of the Hot 100.\n7 (tie). \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for two weeks\n\"Fearless\" was the first rerecorded album that Swift ever released.\nThe \"Taylor's Version\" series was inspired by the sale of Swift's masters to Scooter Braun in 2019, which she described as her \"worst case scenario\" in a passionate open letter. Swift decided to remake and rerelease her first six albums in a bid to reclaim ownership of her life's work. (Braun later sold Swift's masters to a private-equity company.)\nIn addition to faithfully recreating each tracklist, Swift decided to add never-before-heard songs \"from the vault\" that were written during the album's original creative process but cut from the final product.\n\"I've spoken a lot about why I'm remaking my first six albums, but the way I've chosen to do this will hopefully help illuminate where I'm coming from,\" Swift explained. \"Artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one who really knows that body of work.\"\n\"For example, only I know which songs I wrote that almost made the 'Fearless' album,\" she continued. \"Songs I absolutely adored, but were held back for different reasons.\"\nMany were skeptical that the \"Taylor's Version\" project would be embraced by fans, let alone achieve commercial success.\nThose skeptics were forced to eat their words when \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\" began to outpace the original on streaming platforms. According to Billboard, \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\" earned more equivalent album sales in its first week of release than \"Fearless\" earned over the entire next year.\n7 (tie). \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for two weeks\nThe rerecorded version of Swift's third album featured six songs from the vault, including two duets: \"Electric Touch\" with Fall Out Boy and \"Castles Crumbling\" with Hayley Williams, one of Swift's oldest friends.\n6 (tie). \"Reputation\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for four weeks\n\"Reputation\" arrived after an extended period of silence. Her longtime feud with Ye (then known as Kanye West) and Kim Kardashian reached a fever pitch; Swift decamped to London and withdrew from the public eye.\nShe returned with a new snake-infested aesthetic and \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" a cheeky lead single that poked fun at her own persona.\nSwift also declined to participate in interviews or media appearances while promoting her sixth album. Instead, she relied on a simple tagline: \"There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation.\"\n6 (tie). \"Evermore\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for four weeks\n\"Evermore\" was surprise-released just five months after Swift's previous album, \"Folklore.\" The two were billed as \"sister albums,\" created under near-identical conditions with the same team of collaborators.\n\"To put it plainly, we just couldn't stop writing songs,\" Swift explained on social media.\n\"Evermore\" was nominated for album of the year at the 2022 Grammys, but lost to Jon Batiste's \"We Are.\"\n5 (tie). \"Speak Now\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for six weeks\nSwift's third album had a lot to live up to, following the blockbuster success of \"Fearless.\"\nIn response to skeptics \u2014 who questioned whether the teen phenom was relying too heavily on her collaborators \u2014 Swift decided to write \"Speak Now\" entirely by herself. She is the only songwriter credited on the standard tracklist.\n5 (tie). \"Midnights\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for six weeks\nSwift's 10th studio album sold over 1 million copies in its debut week, the first to cross that seven-figure threshold since Swift's own \"Reputation.\" (She has now achieved the feat on seven different occasions.)\n\"Midnights\" also won album of the year at the Grammys, joining \"Fearless,\" \"1989,\" and \"Folklore\" in the prestigious group of victors. Swift is the only artist in history to win album of the year four times.\n5 (tie). \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for six weeks\nThe rerecorded version of \"1989\" was released nine years after the original. Swift added five vault songs to the tracklist, including the fan-favorite closer \"Is It Over Now?\"\n4. \"Red\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for seven weeks\n\"Red\" is Swift's fourth studio album. It featured a mishmash of Max Martin-produced pop bangers (\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" \"I Knew You Were Trouble\") and country-rock breakup anthems (\"State of Grace,\" \"Holy Ground\").\n3. \"Folklore\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for eight weeks\n\"Folklore\" marked a sonic departure for Swift, stripping down her favored synth-pop production to reveal introspective reflections and intricate story arcs.\nThe pandemic-era album was coproduced by Swift, Jack Antonoff, and Aaron Dessner of The National. It received rave reviews from critics and is widely considered her best work to date.\n2 (tie). \"Fearless\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for 11 weeks\nSwift's sophomore effort had the longest run at No. 1 of any album in the 2000s. \"Fearless\" has since been certified diamond by the RIAA.\n2 (tie). \"1989\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for 11 weeks\nSwift's fifth album marked her official pivot from country to pop music, a move that Swift said she had to \"really fight \u2014 and I mean aggressively fight \u2014 to have happen.\"\nIn addition to its double-digit streak atop the Billboard 200, \"1989\" yielded several hit singles on the Hot 100, including \"Shake It Off,\" \"Blank Space,\" and \"Bad Blood.\"\n1. \"The Tortured Poets Department\"\nBillboard 200 peak: No. 1 for 17 weeks\nSwift's 11th studio album did not leave the No. 1 slot for 12 straight weeks after its debut in April, fending off new releases from stars like Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and Zach Bryan.\nSwift briefly yielded the top spot to Eminem and Stray Kids before \"Poets\" notched 13th, 14th, and 15th consecutive weeks atop the chart.\nThe album eventually fell to lower positions, but then in December, it returned for two more weeks at No. 1 after Swift released physical versions of '\"The Anthology\" version for Black Friday.\nThe album's 17-week reign brings Swift's total sum of weeks atop the chart to 86, extending her record among solo artists.\nSince the Billboard 200 was launched in 1956, only The Beatles have logged more weeks at No. 1 than Swift."

      "text": "- Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concluded on Sunday in Vancouver.\n- The tour was an unprecedented financial success, becoming the first to gross over $2 billion.\n- It was a spectacle of endurance and nostalgia that will be difficult for any artist to replicate, Swift included.\nTwenty-one months, 149 shows, and about 484 hours of singing and dancing later, Taylor Swift took her final bow on the Eras Tour on Sunday.\n\"You guys have made this into something completely unrecognizable from anything I've ever done in my life,\" Swift told the crowd in Vancouver. \"With your traditions, with your passion, with the way you care about this tour \u2014 it's unparalleled. I've never experienced anything like it.\"\nThe Eras Tour has been widely celebrated as a cultural phenomenon and money-making marvel. Swift's tour boosted local economies across the globe, from the US to the UK to Singapore. Fans shelled out thousands to see their idol perform a marathon of hits from across her catalog (plus a few surprise deep cuts per show), a spectacle that stretched for over three hours every night. At the end of it all, the Eras Tour became the first tour in history to gross over $2 billion, Swift's production company confirmed to The New York Times.\nBut while all that may be true, there's reason to believe not even Swift's commercial juggernaut has the power to forever alter the touring landscape. The Eras Tour will go down in history as a high watermark for the industry, one it will be difficult for any artist to reach again \u2014 Swift included.\nAs a literal billionaire, Swift's Eras Tour set a standard that's impossible for most artists to meet. In an industry where you have to spend money to make money, the majority of performers who aren't global superstars don't have that much money to spend. In fact, the costs of touring are so high that even major acts like Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and The Black Keys are canceling dates or entire tours.\nBy contrast, Swift has devoted nearly two decades to building her loyal consumer base and her fortune. She's one of a few stars who's perfectly capable of traveling the world, employing a crew of hundreds, and bringing her elaborate stagecraft to life without worrying about the upfront costs.\nYet even those who do have the resources don't necessarily have a desire to mount a tour as intensive as Swift's. Billie Eilish, who broke Swift's own record as the youngest artist in history to win album of the year at the Grammys in 2020, is now three albums deep and currently touring in support of \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" which also garnered critical acclaim.\nIn Swiftian terms, that puts Eilish in her \"Speak Now\" era, riding a similar wave toward dominance. Seven or eight albums down the road, would she be able to stage a three-and-a-half-hour retrospective of her career, a feat that requires months of intensive cardio and dance training? Probably. Would she want to? Probably not.\n\"I'm not doing a three-hour show, that's literally psychotic,\" Eilish told fans in May, per Billboard. \"Nobody wants that. You guys don't want that. I don't want that. I don't even want that as a fan. My favorite artist in the world, I'm not trying to hear them for three hours. That's far too long.\"\nFor many artists, it would be. But Swift is a rare breed. Pulling off the Eras Tour demanded a special blend of longevity, ambition, financial freedom, physical endurance, fan worship, mass commercial appeal, and, let's be honest, self-congratulatory bravado that, at least at this time in music history, is arguably unique to Swift.\nIn \"The Eras Tour\" concert film, Swift admitted that people were initially skeptical about the concept \u2014 but she's accomplished, wealthy, beloved, and stubborn enough that she could ignore her doubters.\nThe eras theme was also particularly smart positioning for Swift at this moment in her career. After Swift's former label sold her catalog without her permission in 2019, she began rerecording and rereleasing her first six albums, a project that asked fans to rekindle their love for her old music \u2014 and their old selves.\nTwo of these rerecorded albums, \"Fearless\" and \"Red\", were unveiled ahead of the Eras Tour, while two more, \"Speak Now\" and \"1989,\" were announced by Swift onstage. The two endeavors worked in conjunction to legitimize each other, infusing fresh tunes into the tour's acoustic sets and giving Swifties the feeling that no matter how deep Swift was into the nearly two-year length of her tour when they saw her perform, she was still fresh off of a new release.\nSwift signed a new label contract ahead of \"Lover,\" so she owns outright every album she's released since then. Once she releases the final two installments of the \"Taylor's Version\" series (\"Reputation\" and \"Taylor Swift\"), the \"Taylor's Version\" project will be over. Similarly, the conditions that allowed the Eras Tour to flourish will never recur.\nOf course, Swifties still have plenty to look forward to. She is famously prolific, so another brand-new album isn't out of the question in the coming years.\nIt's even possible that Swift could stage another billion-dollar tour in her career. Why not? Every time it seems she's reached her peak earning potential, she releases another album that outsells her last.\nBut even if Swift could release another 11 albums and, in another 18 years, launch the Eras Tour Part Two \u2014 would she want to recreate its rare, peculiar magic instead of trying something new? Her own words point to no.\n\"I'll never forget the call when I explained my idea of the concept for the Eras Tour to my team. At the time, I was working on the 'Midnights' album, and if we were to do what I've always done, I would've embarked on planning the Midnights Tour,\" Swift wrote in her new photo book.\n\"But there's nothing I hate more than doing what I've always done.\""

      "text": "- Taylor Swift's Eras Tour was honored as \"Tour of the Century\" at the 2025 iHeart Radio Music Awards.\n- Swift wore a snake-shaped necklace in a pre-recorded video to accept the award.\n- It could be an Easter egg for \"Reputation (Taylor's Version),\" but it's a smart move either way.\nTaylor Swift's attentive fans would never miss a potential Easter egg, and at the iHeart Radio Music Awards on Monday, Swift seemed all too happy to fuel their hunt.\nAlthough Swift did not attend the awards ceremony in Los Angeles, it was previously announced that her $2 billion-grossing Eras Tour would be honored by iHeart as \"Tour of the Century.\" In a pre-recorded acceptance speech, Swift kept it simple by wearing her signature red lipstick and a black long-sleeved top, drawing the eye to her sole accessory: a delicate gold necklace shaped like a snake.\nSwift's jewelry selection sent fans into detective mode on social media. For Swifties, the snake is known as the emblem for her sixth studio album, 2017's \"Reputation.\"\nIn 2021, Swift famously embarked on a quest to rerecord her first six albums. So far, she has released four, leaving just two remaining in the vault: \"Taylor Swift\" and \"Reputation.\"\nSwifties have been anxiously anticipating \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" for years, constantly cooking up new theories for when it might be released. But despite many hints and winks that have kept Swifties on their toes, including on-theme outfits and song snippets, the album has not yet been officially announced.\nSwift's snake necklace could be the vital clue fans have been waiting for. It seems like an intentional way to signal that \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" is on the horizon, especially given that the jewelry resembles a necklace Swift previously wore in the music video for \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" the original album's lead single.\nPlus, Swift herself is a fan of wearing her hints.\n\"Easter eggs can be left on clothing or jewelry,\" Swift told Entertainment Weekly in 2019. \"This is one of my favorite ways to do this.\"\nOn the other hand, this could just be Swift's way of keeping the Easter egg hunt active, even during her downtime.\nSince the Eras Tour ended in December, Swift has been laying unusually low for someone with her unparalleled productivity. She has not shared any updates on Instagram in over three months (a drought in Swiftian terms), and save for attending the Grammys and supporting her boyfriend's football career, she has largely refrained from stepping out in public. As of this writing, it has been 333 days since Swift unveiled her most recent album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" She hasn't gone that long without releasing or even announcing new music since the gap between 2019's \"Lover\" and 2020's \"Folklore\" (336 days, but who's counting?).\nSwifties already know that \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" is coming. The real question is when. Swift's necklace doesn't solve that mystery, but it does keep it alive in the meantime, freeing Swift up for private pursuits.\nOf course, Swift deserves to take a break just like anyone else, particularly after the athletic demands of a two-year global tour. But for most artists who want to make money, staying relevant is a big part of the gig.\nSwift's ability to stir up theories and generate headlines, even in the absence of new music, is one of her greatest assets as a pop star and businesswoman. For her, it can be as simple as wearing a necklace."

      "text": "- Taylor Swift was nominated for six awards at the 2025 Grammys but lost in every category.\n- Swift still appeared to have a blast at the show, cheering for her peers and dancing all night.\n- Swift's self-assured vibe speaks to her stature in the industry. She doesn't need to win to be a winner.\nTaylor Swift may have gone home empty-handed from the 67th annual Grammy Awards, but Swifties would be wise to keep their pitchforks tucked away.\nSwift received six nominations this year, mostly for \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" her wildly successful 11th studio album. (She was also nominated for her collaboration with Gracie Abrams on her song \"Us.\") Swift attended the awards show wearing a shimmering ruby minidress, a golden \"T\" on her thigh, and, despite loss after loss, an unshakeable aura of delight.\nAs each of Swift's chances for an award came and went \u2014 best music video, best pop vocal album, best pop duo/group performance, record of the year, song of the year, and album of the year \u2014 viewers who have heard tales of her charts-obsessed gluttony and hunger for approval would have expected Swift to appear deflated.\nTo be fair, that assumption is far from unfounded. Back in 2014, Swift admitted she was devastated when her fourth album, \"Red,\" lost album of the year to Daft Punk's \"Random Access Memories.\" In her Netflix documentary, \"Miss Americana,\" Swift is shown reacting with palpable shame to the news that her album \"Reputation\" was nearly shut out of the 2018 nominations. \"I just need to make a better record,\" she decides, tail between her legs.\nAs the show ended Sunday night, the X account for Swift's PR team seemed to acknowledge the loss with an upbeat message thanking fans for supporting \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\"Nofuckinbody loved #TSTTPD more than you, and we couldn't be prouder of what this album has accomplished,\" it reads, in part. \"Until our next board meeting.\"\nGoing home empty-handed just one year after breaking a major Grammy record would be tough for anyone to handle, especially for a high achiever with fans and critics following her every move.\n\"There's so much pressure going into putting new music out,\" Swift laments in the documentary. \"If I don't beat everything I've done prior, it'll be deemed as a colossal failure.\"\nOn Sunday, however, Swift appeared confident and like she was having more fun than anyone who made it to the podium. The many cameras inside the event rarely caught Swift in the audience when she wasn't grinning, dancing, or cheering.\nSwift did get a moment onstage to present the award for best country album. When she pulled Beyonc\u00e9's name from the envelope, her face lit up with uninhibited glee.\nIt was one of the most heartfelt and meaningful exchanges of the evening \u2014 bringing a canon pop-culture event full circle.\nAt the 2009 VMAs, after Swift was infamously interrupted onstage, Beyonc\u00e9 sacrificed her acceptance speech for video of the year to let a young country darling reclaim her moment. On Sunday, more than 15 years later, that former ingenue handed country music's top prize to the icon who always respected and inspired her.\nSwift wasn't a nominee in that category, but even her losses seemed to glimmer with karmic energy.\nWhen Sabrina Carpenter won best pop vocal album for \"Short n' Sweet,\" Swift could be seen relishing the announcement like a proud mom, her mouth agape.\nCarpenter is part of a new generation of pop stars raised on Swift's music who even shared covers of Swift's songs on YouTube when she was a child. These days, Swift has transformed from Carpenter's idol to her mentor and friend, even tapping the \"Espresso\" singer to open for multiple legs of the Eras Tour.\nLater, when Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" beat Swift's \"Fortnight\" for record of the year, she lifted her glass to toast the rapper.\nThis was no empty gesture; Swift and Lamar are close collaborators who teamed up for the first time in 2015 for a remix of \"Bad Blood.\" Their duet gave Lamar his first-ever No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and he returned to Swift's side eight years later to rerecord his verse for \"Bad Blood (Taylor's Version).\"\nSwift didn't reserve her praise and excitement for friends, either. She was spotted gossiping with Chappell Roan, dancing jubilantly to Charli XCX's \"Von Dutch,\" and clinking glasses with Jay-Z when Beyonc\u00e9 won album of the year.\nSkeptics will say this was all performative, but anyone who's seen \"Valentine's Day\" or \"Cats\" could tell you that she's not much of an actor.\nOf course, being perceived as a sore loser or wet blanket would be bad for business, and Swift is never one to squander a photo op. But Swift has reached a point in her career where she can truly enjoy her success \u2014 and the demonstrable proof of her influence, stature, and longevity \u2014 without trying to outshine her past achievements. She'll toast to that."
