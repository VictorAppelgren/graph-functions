  "description": "Sean Kingston will spend 3\u00bd behind bars, a judge decided Friday, for his involvement in a $1-million fraud scheme. His mom is serving 5 years for the same crime.",
  "content": "Sean Kingston was sentenced to prison on Friday, months after a Florida court convicted him and his mother of defrauding several businesses of more than $1 million.\n\n\u201cBeautiful Girls\u201d hitmaker Sean Kingston will spend three and a half years behind bars for his involvement in a months-long scheme that defrauded luxury goods businesses of more than $1 million.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Leibowitz handed down the 35-year-old performer\u2019s sentence Friday, months after a Florida jury convicted the singer (born Kisean Paul Anderson) and his mother, Janice Turner, in March on one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and four counts of wire fraud each.\n\n\u201cWe respect the Court\u2019s decision and the judicial process,\u201d Kingston attorney Zeljka Bozanic told The Times in a statement. Bozanic said Kingston\u2019s defense team is \u201ccontent\u201d the court opted for a shorter prison sentence \u2014 the government had requested five years in prison \u2014 and said \u201cmost of the restitution in this case was paid back, even before these charges were brought.\u201d\n\n\u201cSean is taking this as a learning experience and will continue moving forward in a positive direction,\u201d Bozanic added. \u201cWe are actively reviewing all available options, including potential appeals, to ensure his rights are fully protected.\u201d\n\nDuring his court appearance in a South Florida courtroom Friday, Kingston apologized to the judge and said he had learned from his actions. Under house arrest since his conviction, Kingston was taken into custody immediately despite a defense attorney\u2019s request that Kingston self-surrender at a later date due to health issues. Prior to the sentencing, Bozanic filed a sentencing memorandum requesting that the court consider a shorter sentence.\n\n\u201cMr. Anderson accepted responsibility in this case and has made all the positive steps toward learning and growing from this situation,\u201d Bozanic said in the memorandum, which also describes the singer\u2019s previous charitable acts. The document notes that Kingston has \u201cnever served prison time before\u201d and that a \u201chigh sentence is not necessary to deter future conduct.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida accused Kingston and his mother of swindling more than $480,000 worth of jewelry from one person and, from others, a Cadillac Escalade worth nearly $160,000 and furniture costing upward of $86,500. Prosecutors said Kingston and his mother also stole more than $200,000 from Bank of America and more than $100,000 from First Republic Bank \u2014 allegations they initially denied.\n\nSWAT officers descended on the \u201cTake You There\u201d singer\u2019s Florida home last May. His mother was arrested during the raid and Kingston was arrested soon after near the Fort Irwin Army base in San Bernardino County. Turner was sentenced to five years in prison last month.\n\nKingston rose to popularity in the early 2000s for \u201cBeautiful Girls,\u201d which samples Ben E. King\u2019s \u201cStand By Me.\u201d He is also known for the songs \u201cEenie Meenie,\u201d \u201cFire Burning\u201d and \u201cMe Love.\u201d\n\nTimes editorial library director Cary Schneider and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Comedian Paul Rodriguez arrested in Burbank again on suspicion of drug possession\n- Share via\nComedian Paul Rodriguez faces fresh allegations of narcotics possession after being arrested on similar charges less than five months ago in the same city.\nBurbank police arrested the 70-year-old \u201cBlood Work\u201d and \u201cRat Race\u201d actor around 8:30 p.m. Monday at a parking structure in the city\u2019s downtown area, police Sgt. Stephen Turner confirmed to The Times on Thursday. Rodriguez was booked later at Burbank City Jail on suspicion of misdemeanor narcotics possession.\nHe was released early Tuesday morning with a citation and is due in court Sept. 5. A legal representative for Rodriguez did not immediately respond to The Times\u2019 request for comment Thursday.\nPolice showed up at the parking structure for a welfare check after a witness voiced concern about a man and woman leaving a restaurant in the area. According to Turner, the witness told police the woman and the man, later identified as Rodriguez, were \u201cunder the influence and not alert.\u201d Officers located people who matched the witness\u2019 description in a vehicle in the structure. Rodriguez was in the driver\u2019s seat and a woman was in the front passenger seat.\nComedian Paul Rodriguez was arrested after police allegedly found narcotics in his vehicle Friday night in Burbank.\n\u201cThe investigation led to the discovery of alprazolam [Xanax] and heroin inside of the female\u2019s personal bag,\u201d Turner said, adding that the woman was arrested on suspicion of drug possession.\nOfficers also allegedly found Xanax and \u201csuspected fentanyl\u201d in Rodriguez\u2019s vehicle. The actor said the drugs weren\u2019t his, Turner said.\nThe details of Rodriguez\u2019s arrest Monday echo those from his previous arrest in Burbank in March. The \u201cA Million Little Things\u201d actor was arrested after police allegedly found narcotics in his vehicle during a traffic stop.\nRodriguez disputed law enforcement\u2019s recounting of the incident, telling TMZ in March that he was sleeping in the passenger seat when a \u201cCaucasian\u201d officer on a \u201cpower trip\u201d slapped him to wake him up. Rodriguez told the outlet that the drugs belonged to the person who was driving.\nSoulja Boy sings \u2018first day out\u2019 as he celebrates his release from police custody. He was arrested in Los Angeles over the weekend on suspicion of felony weapons possession.\nAt the time, Rodriguez\u2019s attorney Bobby Samini called the charges against his client false and said the comic\u2019s arrest and treatment by police were a \u201cviolation of his civil rights.\u201d\n\u201cHe fully cooperated with law enforcement at all times,\u201d Samini said in March. \u201cLaw enforcement asserted that the driver of the vehicle was in possession of a controlled substance. Mr. Rodriguez did not have any controlled substance in his possession, nor was he under the influence of any controlled substance.\u201d\nRodriguez, who was born in Mexico and raised in East Los Angeles, began his career at L.A. comedy clubs in the late 1970s and has written and starred in numerous comedy specials. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also includes hosting gigs for Univision and MTV programs and roles in films \u201cMade in America,\u201d \u201cTortilla Soup\u201d and \u201cThe World\u2019s Fastest Indian.\u201d\nTimes senior Sacramento reporter Taryn Luna contributed to this article."

      "text": "ENHYPEN sheds \u2018boy band\u2019 label ahead of BMO Stadium performance in los angeles\n- Share via\nImagine if almost every moment in your life was documented: the good, the bad, the funny, the embarrassing and even the most heartbreaking. For the K-pop superstar group ENHYPEN, they don\u2019t need to imagine it. It has been a part of their lives since they were teenagers, when they participated in the Korean competition series \u201cI-LAND\u201d in 2020.\nPremiering at the height of BTS mania, in which BTS made an appearance, the series was a joint venture between multinational entertainment companies CJ Entertainment and HYBE. It was a global success, with worldwide online viewership of over 20 million across 12 episodes, and participation from over 178 countries in the vote casting.\nEvery part of the contestants\u2019 lives was documented as they lived and trained at the compound, with every fan-favorite moment turned into fan edits and memes. Even after the series concluded, it didn\u2019t take long for the group to debut and return to the public eye. Within two months, ENHYPEN \u2014 comprised of Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo and Ni-ki \u2014 released their first EP, \u201cBorder : Day One.\u201d\nSince then, the group\u2019s meteoric rise has been nonstop: They\u2019ve released 11 albums (five of which have placed in the Billboard 200 Top 10), performed at this year\u2019s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and accomplished two world tours. The group is currently on its third international jaunt, the \u201cWalk the Line\u201d world tour, and is set to perform Saturday at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe it has only been five years since they debuted. Now almost all in their early 20s, the group\u2019s members are trying to prove that they\u2019re no longer the boys they once were at the start of their careers. With their latest EP release, \u201cDesire : Unleash,\u201d they want to show ENGENEs \u2014 the name for their fandom \u2014 how much they\u2019ve grown as artists and as people. Their recent Coachella set showcased a more edgy side to their performance, one that they had arranged themselves.\n\u201cOne of the most impressive moments in our growth journey was Coachella,\u201d says Heeseung. \u201cWhen I think back to when we just debuted, I don\u2019t think we were even boys. We were almost babies. We began this journey with such young members, and we\u2019ve made it all the way here. We grew physically, but throughout this journey, we also grew mentally, and that has helped us show the best side of ourselves.\u201d\nGrowing up in the public eye was not easy for the group, whose youngest member, Ni-ki, was 14 years old during the competition. They had to adapt to their new lifestyle quickly, but felt fortunate to be surrounded by a good team and staff that made it easier. Though Ni-ki is aware his childhood was not the norm, he says he received a lot of mental stimulation that helped him develop into the person he is now.\n\u201cBecause I started in this scene from a young age, I had to go through many changes,\u201d Ni-ki explains. \u201cFor example, my personality underwent many changes, and I realized many different things because I was in a good environment for that to happen.\u201d\nSunoo admits they were a little immature and clumsy during \u201cI-LAND\u201d and even during their debut, but it was really who they were at the time. What has been depicted through the show, behind-the-scenes footage and their social media is who they are.\n\u201cNow that I think about it, we showed almost everything,\u201d Sunoo admits. \u201cDuring the show, we were showing the very raw version of ourselves. I think our fans did love those sides of us as well. As we grew, they got to love us even more.\u201d\nLeader Jungwon believes that having everything on social media helped the group\u2019s popularity as they debuted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since they couldn\u2019t meet their fans offline, they relied on social media to connect with them. He says, \u201cThere are clear pros and cons of being in this [digital] era. Before we debuted and appeared on \u2018I-LAND,\u2019 social media was already widespread, making it easy for things about us to go viral.\u201d\nDr. Hye Jin Lee, a K-pop scholar and clinical assistant professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, notes that social media may have helped ENHYPEN grow further, as social media usage reached an all-time high during the pandemic. TikTok users soared around that time, providing another platform for the group to increase its visibility and share its music through short-form content. With over 30 million fans on TikTok, the group follows viral trends and dance challenges, as well as having done livestreams on both TikTok and its company\u2019s official app, Weverse.\n\u201cENHYPEN had to rely on digital media to meet and interact with fans due to debuting at a time when in-person performances weren\u2019t possible,\u201d Lee explains. \u201cThat has allowed them to build strong connections with their fans. That\u2019s why they\u2019re more prolific on social media. They post on Weverse daily and are very active on TikTok.\u201d\nENHYPEN is conscious of its public image and the constant surveillance by its fans through the group\u2019s media and livestream appearances. At first, they were cautious of the image they wanted to project. However, over time, they realized it was better just to be themselves.\n\u201cThese days, I want to show who I am and the natural side of myself,\u201d says Sunghoon. \u201cGoing forward, as I age, the perception that I would like to have would change as well. As you get older, the way you think also changes. But, at the moment and present, I just want to be who I am in front of other people.\u201d\nFans noticed these changes, as the members have begun to express their opinions and boundaries openly. Jungwon recently admitted during an interview that he felt he was too young when he first performed their the group\u2019s song \u201cFever.\u201d Jake began opening up about the pressures he felt throughout his career. Sunoo, who was given the nickname \u201cDdeonu\u201d for his cute expressions, has started to turn down doing cute poses during interviews and livestreams.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think being cute all the time is very suitable for who I am at this moment,\u201d Sunoo shares. \u201cOur fans still would love to see me being cute and adorable, so I don\u2019t think I can do away with it completely. So when they want to see that side of me, I go ahead, but I don\u2019t go out of my way to do it when there isn\u2019t any request. That\u2019s the kind of balance I\u2019m trying to strike at this moment.\u201d\nJay has taken it a step further, going on the group\u2019s official livestream channels to offer advice to ENGENEs who are struggling or seeking guidance. He adds his own life experiences to his words of comfort and advice, opening up another side to the serious artist.\n\u201cBeing in this career for the past five years, I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s really impossible to make things up,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that one side that we can truly show to people is when we\u2019re true to ourselves. Whenever I do something or think about something, I try to be sincere and honest about my feelings and no longer make things just because I want to be seen in a certain way or leave a certain kind of impression.\u201d\nFans have looked out for the group\u2019s best interests, including commenting on the members\u2019 hectic schedule. As one of the most in-demand groups in the industry, with several comebacks, tours, fashion shows, press days, variety shows, brand ambassadorships and writing/producing music, ENHYPEN\u2019s members know what they\u2019ve signed up for in becoming a K-pop artist.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very heartwarming that our fans are very concerned about our health, but I want to say that the very core of everything that we do is coming from our passion,\u201d says Jake. \u201cNo one is telling us to do this. We want to do this. We chose this for ourselves. Going back to that thought helps us stay grounded and motivated.\u201d\nAlthough they cherish the \u201cI-LAND\u201d and debut memories of the past five years, they are looking ahead to the group\u2019s future in 2025. Jay says this year marks a significant turning point in their careers, highlighted by Coachella, \u201cDesire : Unleash\u201d and the \u201cWalk the Line\u201d world tour.\n\u201cThis is a consistent flow,\u201d says Jay. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be this momentum that will bring us to our next step as ENHYPEN. We will use this as a beginning to venture out into many more fields ahead.\u201d\nSunghoon is looking forward to making it to a decade with the group, curious about how that will look for them together and individually.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure ENHYPEN will be together, but I think we\u2019ll be more active in pursuing our individual pursuits,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m curious to find out what that will look like and how much more we will have grown [by then]. When we work as individuals, we work hard, and when we get together again, we will work amazingly as a team.\u201d"

      "text": "Sean Kingston arrested in SoCal\u2019s Fort Irwin after SWAT raid on singer\u2019s South Florida rental\n- Share via\nSinger-rapper Sean Kingston was arrested in San Bernardino County on Thursday, hours after a SWAT team raided his rented mansion in South Florida.\nKingston, known for hits \u201cBeautiful Girls\u201d and \u201cFire Burning,\u201d was arrested near the Fort Irwin Army base without incident in connection to a Florida warrant, the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed to the Associated Press. The Teen Choice Awards winner, 34, was detained hours after his 61-year-old mother, Janice Turner, was arrested in Florida.\nSWAT officers descended Thursday afternoon on Kingston\u2019s rented mansion in Southwest Ranches, an affluent Fort Lauderdale suburb that touts action star Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson among its high-profile residents. A spokesperson for the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Department did not immediately respond to The Times\u2019 request Friday for more details about the arrests.\nThis article was originally on a blog post platform and may be missing photos, graphics or links.\nLaw enforcement officers could be seen after the raid loading a van with goods, AP said. Video from NBC6 South Florida showed several high-end vehicles \u2014 including a Mercedes-Benz, a pair of Bentleys and a Tesla \u2014 parked outside the property.\nRobert Rosenblatt, a legal representative for the \u201cEenie Meenie\u201d singer (real name Kisean Anderson) and his mother, told AP on Thursday he is \u201caware of allegations\u201d against his clients and is \u201cconfident of a successful resolution.\u201d Before his own arrest, the Jamaica-raised artist seemingly addressed the raid and his mother\u2019s arrest on Instagram.\n\u201cPeople love negative energy,\u201d he wrote in a since-expired Instagram story. \u201cI am good, and so is my mother!..my lawyers are handling everything as we speak.\u201d\nKingston and his mother have both faced legal troubles. Turner pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud for stealing more than $160,000 and served nearly a 18 months in prison, AP reported, citing legal records. She is being held at Broward County\u2019s Main Jail in lieu of a $160,000 bond.\nKingston, who was hospitalized in 2011 for a near-fatal jet ski crash, was sued in February for allegedly defrauding a Florida company that installed a 232-inch TV in his home. Attorney Dennis Card, who sued Kingston and was present for the raid, told AP that the search was partly connected to the lawsuit.\nYou\u2019re the teen prince of the summer\u2019s signature song, the kind that has reigned over iTunes, ring tones and MySpace alike, an innocent but cunning confection that\u2019s seeped into nearly everyone\u2019s consciousness in Doppler form from so many cars blasting it out of souped-up speakers.\nCard\u2019s complaint alleges that Kingston reached out to Ver Ver Entertainment about buying the $150,000 television. The musician allegedly told Ver Ver Entertainment\u2018s owners that he and \u201cEenie Meenie\u201d collaborator Justin Bieber would do commercials for the company if they agreed to a lower down payment. He put $30,000 down, but the commercials never came to fruition, the lawsuit alleges. Kingston made no additional payments, Card alleges. Kingston and Bieber have not released a song together since their 2010 hit.\n\u201cIt is amazing what you can get away with if you are a celebrity,\u201d the attorney told AP on Thursday. \u201cHe creates this larger-than-life, \u2018I am rich\u2019 persona. His mother is a necessary component in this. He presents himself as a family-oriented guy, \u2018I\u2019m taking care of my mom,\u2019 but she knows full well what is going on.\u201d\nKingston also faced multiple charges of weapons-law violations, fraud and robbery in Florida in 2018. He is serving two years\u2019 probation for trafficking stolen property for a 2020 incident involving an unpaid jewelry bill, according to the Florida Department of Corrections database.\nKingston will remain in California pending extradition to Florida."

      "text": "Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs faces uncertain future after partial legal victory on sex charges\n- Share via\nThe federal trial of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs wrapped up this week with a partial victory for the music mogul with jurors finding him guilty of transportation for prostitution, but clearing him of charges that could have kept him behind bars for life.\nBut the dramatic legal saga that captivated the public and provided a glimpse into the life of one of the nation\u2019s most powerful music figures is far from over. He still faces dozens of civil lawsuits accusing him of misconduct and sexual assault.\n\u201cThis verdict does not make the civil cases go away, where the burden of proof is much lower,\u201d said Dmitry Gorin, a former sex crimes prosecutor and defense attorney. \u201cThe criminal case may have been more successful in state court as to what the government actually proved \u2014 domestic violence and extortion.\u201d\nDuring the trial, prosecutors portrayed Combs and his associates as operating a mob-style racketeering operation that lured female victims, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Once he had gained their interest, prosecutors said Combs used force, threats of force, coercion and drugs to get them to engage in sex acts with male prostitutes while he occasionally watched in gatherings that Combs referred to as \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d\nThe government alleged his company, Bad Boy Entertainment, functioned as a criminal enterprise that threatened and abused women and used members to engage in a litany of crimes including kidnapping, sex trafficking, bribery, arson, forced labor and obstruction of justice. But jurors rejected prosecutors\u2019 assertions, clearing Combs of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and racketeering, which could have carried a life sentence.\nHow much time Combs will spend behind bars for the prostitution-related conviction remains unknown. He has been in custody since he was first arrested in September.\nThe jury\u2019s split verdict leaves Combs facing up to 10 years in prison for each of the two counts of prostitution. In a letter to the court seeking to keep him in jail, prosecutors listed sentencing guidelines ranging from 51 to 63 months, or just over five years. The guidelines were based on a variety of enhancements alleging multiple victims, that Combs acted as a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d for his onetime lover, Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura, and ex-girlfriend identified only as Jane, during the freak-offs.\nFormer federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani said the amount of time Combs serves will depend on whether the judge accepts the government\u2019s enhancements. Those details will be litigated before a sentence is handed down, he said.\n\u201cI personally think this is sour grapes by the prosecution because they lost badly on the most serious counts,\u201d Rahmani said. \u201cCombs may be a terrible person, but he\u2019s not guilty of anything but minor prostitution charges. I think he should get time served or close to it.\u201d\nGorin said it\u2019s likely that Combs\u2019 attorneys will push for probation.\n\u201cHe was found responsible for paying sex workers to travel across state lines, but at the end of the day that is a loss for the government,\u201d he said.\nStill, Judge Arun Subramanian has considerable latitude in deciding just how much time Combs will serve. Regardless of the length of the sentence, Combs will be required to serve at least 85% of his term because he was convicted of federal charges. Defendants convicted of felonies in state cases often only serve about 50% of the time they were sentenced when they\u2019re given credit for good behavior.\nSo far, Subramanian hasn\u2019t gone easy on the celebrity.\nHe ruled Wednesday that Combs would remain jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn until his sentencing hearing, citing past violent incidents that his attorneys acknowledged during the trial.\nIn explaining his decision, Subramanian referenced testimony by Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, Jane, that the celebrity choked and dragged her during an argument in June 2024 when Combs was aware he was being investigated.\n\u201cIt is impossible for the defendant to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he poses no danger,\u201d Subramanian said.\nCombs\u2019 attorneys had proposed a $1-million bond and offered to surrender his passport, have him undergo drug testing and restrict his travel to New York, Los Angeles and Miami.\nIn a letter arguing for his release, Combs\u2019 attorneys noted that Combs has children and an 85-year-old mother with various health conditions who would like her son to be her primary caretaker.\n\u201cIt would be unjust to continue detaining Mr. Combs at the MDC even one day longer, especially since \u2014 given the sentencing guidelines for these prostitution offenses \u2014 he would otherwise be entitled to serve any additional time imposed at a lower-security facility,\u201d his attorneys wrote.\nStill, Subramanian said detention is \u201cmandatory\u201d for the prostitution-related charge, under the law known as the Mann Act. Combs\u2019 sentencing date has not been set, but the judge proposed holding the hearing in October, meaning Combs will have been in custody for more than a year.\nRahmani acknowledges that the judge\u2019s decision to hold Combs and set a sentencing for October may not be a good sign for the hip-hop mogul.\n\u201cIt does suggest he plans to sentence Combs to more than time served, perhaps a lot more,\u201d Rahmani said.\nLouis Shapiro, a defense attorney who represents defendants in federal cases, echoed that the judge keeping Combs in custody suggests he\u2019s leaning toward the prosecution\u2019s view of sentencing.\n\u201cI expect the judge will meet the parties in the middle and impose at least a two-year sentence, where he gets credit for the time he already served,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThe government is trying to focus the judge on the evidence of Diddy\u2019s domestic violence, even though he wasn\u2019t convicted of it. Given that the judge didn\u2019t release him after the verdict, it would indicate that the judge is buying into their argument.\u201d\nAnother wild card also remains \u2014 a possible presidential pardon.\nIn May, as the trial was underway, a reporter asked President Trump about the case, noting he has the power to pardon individuals convicted of federal crimes.\nTrump told reporters no one had asked him about pardoning the celebrity. He said he hadn\u2019t been following the case closely and would \u201ccertainly look at the facts.\u201d\n\u201cI know people are thinking about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think some people have been very close to asking.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Combs was exultant after the jury delivered its verdict, acquitting him of the most serious charges the government levied against him.\nFor his defense team, the result was vindication of what they\u2019ve maintained all along: \u201cHe has not sexually assaulted anybody, certainly hasn\u2019t sex-trafficked anybody and the jury found that today,\u201d attorney Teny Geragos said.\n\u201cOne thing stands between all of us and a prison, and that is a jury of 12 citizens,\u201d Marc Agnifilo, Combs\u2019 lead defense attorney, said outside the courthouse. \u201cAnd we had a wonderful jury, they listened to every word. And they got the situation right, or certainly right enough.\u201d"

Schulz comics or memorizing the TV specials \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I really was a fan of outside of music\u201d \u2014 but he loved Vince Guaraldi\u2019s music for the animated specials.\nHe started studying Charlie Brown and the gang when he was hired to write the title song for \u201cIt\u2019s the Small Things, Charlie Brown,\u201d sung by Charlie\u2019s sister Sally in the 2022 Apple TV special. And he recently dove back into the world of these iconic characters when he returned to write the final three songs for \u201cSnoopy Presents: A Summer Musical.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good that I came to fully appreciate the world of \u2018Peanuts\u2019 as an adult,\u201d says Folds, although he adds that he was still starstruck about writing for Charlie Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cI was asking the Schulz family, \u2018Can I say this?\u2019 and they\u2019d say, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s yours.\u2019\u201d\nFolds\u2019 best-known songs, such as \u201cBrick,\u201d \u201cSong for the Dumped,\u201d \u201cArmy,\u201d \u201cRockin\u2019 the Suburbs\u201d and \u201cZak and Sara,\u201d may seem too sardonic or dark for the sweet world of Snoopy and company. But he sees it differently.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of deep stuff there. \u2018Peanuts,\u2019 like \u2018Mister Rogers,\u2019 presents an empathetic and nuanced, not dumbed-down view of the world, and that is rare for kids programming,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to say stuff in my songs that kids will understand but that will go over the heads of many adults.\u201d\nHe also knows how to approach the storytelling aspect of musical writing pragmatically.\nWithin the show\u2019s parameters, Folds is grateful to the creators for giving him his artistic freedom. \u201cThey give me carte blanche and don\u2019t push back\u201d Folds says, adding that when he puts in poetic imagery \u2014 \u201dI\u2019m not calling myself f\u2014ing Keats or anything,\u201d he adds as an aside \u2014 director Erik Wiese would weave those ideas into the animation. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool to see.\u201d\n\u201cMy ambition is to have them tell me that my lyrics meant they could delete pages of script,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s what these songs are for.\u201d\nWiese says Folds was the ideal person to \u201ctake the mantle\u201d from Guaraldi: \u201cHe brings a modern thing and his lyrics are so poetic; on his albums he always touches your heart.\u201d\nWriter and executive producer Craig Schulz, who is Charles\u2019 son, was impressed by both Folds\u2019 songwriting and the responsibility the musician felt to the \u201cPeanuts\u201d brand. \u201cHe has a unique ability to really get into what each of the gang is thinking and drive the audience in the direction we want to,\u201d says Schulz, adding that there was one day where the writers got on the phone with Folds to explain the emotions they needed a scene to convey \u201cand suddenly he says, \u2018I got it, I\u2019m super-excited\u2019 and then he hangs up and runs to the piano and cranks it out.\u201d\nThe first song Folds wrote for \u201cA Summer Musical\u201d was when Charlie Brown realizes that the camp he holds dear \u201cis going to get mown over in the name of progress. I wanted him to have the wisdom of his 60-year-old self to go back to \u2018when we were light as the clouds\u2019 to let him understand the future,\u201d he says. So it\u2019s a poignant song even as he\u2019s writing about Charlie Brown looking through \u201cold pictures of people he met five days ago. That\u2019s the way kids are \u2014 they\u2019re taking in a whole world and learning a lot in five days.\u201d\n(He did not write the show\u2019s first two songs, though you\u2019ll hear plenty of Folds-esque piano and melody in them because, Wiese says, \u201cWe wanted it to sound cohesive.\u201d)\nIn the final song, Folds\u2019 lyrics celebrate the saving of the camp (yeah, spoiler alert, but it\u2019s \u201cPeanuts,\u201d so you know the ending will be happy), but he laces in the idea that these children are inheriting a lot of bad things from older generations, including climate change. But it\u2019s not cynical, instead adding an understanding that their parents did the best they could (with a \u201cHello Mother, Hello Father\u201d reference thrown in for the old-timers) and that this new generation will do the best they can and make their own mistakes.\nFolds says it\u2019s important for people in the arts and on the left to bring a realistic view but not to become doomsayers.\n\u201cI see how bad it could get, but there are two stories you can always tell that might be true \u2014 one way to talk about climate change will leave people saying, \u2018We\u2019re screwed anyway so I\u2019ll just drink out of plastic bottles and toss them in the garbage,\u2019 but the other way is to motivate people, to tell a story that shows an aspiration towards the future.\u201d\nThat does not mean, of course, that Folds is blind to the perils of the moment. He stepped down as the National Symphony Orchestra\u2019s artistic advisor at the Kennedy Center to protest Donald Trump\u2019s power play there.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be a pawn in that,\u201d he says. \u201cWas I supposed to call my homies like Sara Bareilles and say, \u2018Hey, do you want to come play here?\u2019\u201d But he\u2019s focusing on the positive, noting that he\u2019s now working with other symphony orchestras with that free time.\nFolds has recently also tried countering the turmoil of our current era: Last year he released his first Christmas album, \u201cSleigher,\u201d and his 2023 album \u201cWhat Matters Most\u201d opens with \u201cBut Wait, There\u2019s More,\u201d which offers political commentary but then talks about believing in the good of humankind, and closes with the uplifting \u201cMoments.\u201d\nAnd obviously, Folds knows that a show that stars a beagle and a small yellow bird that defies classification is not the right place to get bogged down in the issues of the day. Even when the lyrics dip into melancholy waters, they find a positive place to land.\n\u201cIn this era I don\u2019t want the art that passes through my world to not have some semblance of hope,\u201d he says."

The warrant alleges that they also stole more than $200,000 from Bank of America and more than $100,000 from First Republic Bank.\nPolice also charged Kingston with allegedly violating the terms of his two-year probation for trafficking stolen property in a 2020 incident involving an unpaid jewelry bill.\nBoth Kingston and his mother have each faced legal woes in the past. In 2006, Turner pleaded guilty to bank fraud for stealing more than $160,000 and served nearly 18 months in prison. In 2018, Kingston faced multiple charges of weapons-law violations, fraud and robbery in Florida.\nAt the time of the SWAT raid, Rosenblatt told AP that he was \u201caware of the allegations\u201d against his clients and was \u201cconfident of a successful resolution.\u201d"
