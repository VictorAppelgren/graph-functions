      "feedback": "Nice work anchoring to the A85HNI04L briefing, but to reach world‑class quality you should reorganize into a tight, testable 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and quantified anchors drawn only from the source. Edit suggestions in one compact paragraph: reframe as a formal base case plus two explicit alts (e.g., Alt 1: Gemini‑powered Siri launch on a 2026 timeline with App Intents cross‑app integration; Alt 2: Apple pursues an internal Linwood path with limited external bets) and map each to concrete triggers (e.g., a public Gemini integration milestone on Apple servers; a spring 2026 App Intents upgrade readiness; any formal confirmation from Apple/Alphabet) and clear invalidation rules (e.g., Gemini agreement falls through; Apple delays beyond 6 months; regulatory/privacy constraints force opt‑in constraints). Anchor timing to known data: the Siri upgrade is “potential 2026 release” with 3–6 month horizon for near‑term catalysts (A85HNI04L), plus the ongoing Apple/AI ecosystem context (e.g., ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence demonstrations and external‑AI collaboration signals) alluded to in the same piece (A85HNI04L). Quantify where possible with firm numbers from the material (e.g., 2026 release window; 3–6 month horizon) and flag where you must refrain from numeric guesses; include a concise watch‑list of signals: Gemini integration confirmation, App Intents progress, official Apple Intelligence updates, and any announced shifts in Apple/AI spend (A85HNI04L). Strengthen causal chain by tracing how Gemini/Apple partnership affects Siri workflow, latency, and cross‑app actions, and explicitly note regulatory/privacy dynamics as a gating variable; end with a base case, two clear alts, the principal risks, watch‑list signals, and a clear confidence tag. Place (A85HNI04L) after each assertion tied to the source, and avoid extraneous peripheral product chatter not directly relevant to the Siri/ Gemini narrative.",
