  "content": "5 Of The Most Famous Private Aircraft Crashes & The Technical Failures Behind Them\n\nPrivate aviation, a diverse sector that extends beyond the realm of military, large-scale passenger, or commercial transport operations, offers more than just a means for the wealthy to jet-set to exotic locales. It encompasses a wide range of activities, from private recreational flying in propeller-driven Cessnas to the high-powered jet aircraft and turbine helicopters that transport VIPs and donated organs. Private jet travel differs from commercial travel, often to the traveler's benefit. Some of the fastest private jets in the world whisk VIPs to destinations in the blink of an eye. Regulations and dutiful maintenance make flying as safe as possible \u2014 impressively so, given the number of flights that take place without a hitch daily. Aviation professionals of all types strive to minimize accidents by learning from mistakes and meticulously maintaining their certifications and aircraft. Yet, with over 22,000 private jets (about two-thirds of which are American-owned) registered, and an untold number of privately operated helicopters and propeller aircraft accumulating millions of flight hours each year, it's a tragic fact that Murphy's Law will rear its ugly head from time to time. The costs of private aviation are such that it's a privilege typically associated with wealthy individuals. Because many high-profile individuals use private jets, some of these incidents capture the public's attention and make headlines worldwide. We explore some famous private aircraft crashes and examine the technical reasons behind the tragedy.\n\nFew embody the modern jet-set lifestyle better than the music star. Traveling between cities and continents to play shows around the world is a dream for millions. However, the high-flying lifestyle comes with its share of risks. Travis Barker, drummer of pop-punk behemoth Blink-182, was aboard a Learjet 60 on September 19, 2008, waiting to begin the runway roll for a flight from Columbia, South Carolina, to Los Angeles, California. With him aboard were 35-year-old Adam Goldstein, known to music fans as DJ AM, and Barker's employees and friends Chris Baker, aged 29, and Charles Still, aged 25. In the cockpit, 31-year-old pilot Sarah Lemmon was at the controls alongside 52-year-old co-pilot James Bland. Disaster struck as the Learjet, embarking on a 150 mph takeoff down an 8,000-foot runway at Columbia Metropolitan Airport, failed to take flight. Instead, it broke through the fence at the end of the runway, crossed a large highway, and collided with an embankment, where it burst into flames. Of the six souls aboard, only two emerged from the wreckage: Barker and Goldstein. Both suffered severe burns and mental trauma from the incident. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ultimately concluded that the combination of a design flaw in the Learjet and poor maintenance was responsible. The tires on the aircraft reportedly lost 2% of air pressure per day if not topped off and would require replacement after eight days without maintenance. Those on the Learjet's landing gear had not been checked for three weeks. All four of the aircraft's tires blew out during takeoff, resulting in the vicious crash. The involved parties and estates later settled several lawsuits. Goldstein lost his life to an accidental overdose in 2009, leaving Barker the incident's sole survivor.\n\nPayne Stewart was a successful professional golfer known for his anachronistic style. He wore traditional vintage golf clothing while competing on the PGA tour. His travel style was less anachronistic. As a professional athlete in a profitable sport, Stewart traveled on private jets. After all, it's much easier to bring equipment like golf bags and other luxuries aboard when you fly private, which is precisely what he was doing on October 25, 1999, alongside at least four people. The Learjet 35 carrying Stewart's party planned a five-flight sequence from Orlando, Florida, to Houston, Texas, over two days. Yet the aircraft went down hundreds of miles off course, smashing into a field near Aberdeen, South Dakota, killing everyone on board. How did a modern private jet fly so far off course before crashing? The first clue came from the Air Force pilots sent to investigate the errant craft after it failed to establish communication during an air traffic control handoff. The pilots reported seeing frost on the inside of the windscreen but no movement inside the craft. The wayward Learjet's crew made no further radio communications before the plane began a right turn and descent nearly 3 hours after losing contact. Powerless F-16 pilots from North Dakota's National Guard Air Wing watched it spiral before impacting the ground. The NTSB report ultimately determined the probable cause of the accident as rapid decompression of the plane, which caused its occupants to lose consciousness, including the pilots, leaving it to fly on autopilot until it ran out of fuel. Although depressurization was officially determined to be the probable cause, the NTSB was unable to establish the reason the plane's pressurization system malfunctioned.\n\nOn October 20, 1977, a twin-propeller Convair 240 carrying members of the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd and their associates crashed outside of Gillsburg, Mississippi. Some members of the party had reservations about the aircraft's condition due to its performance during a previous flight. Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant reportedly philosophized that when \"It's your time to go, it's your time to go\" during the discussion. Ultimately, 24 passengers and two pilots boarded for a 2-hour-45-minute flight from Greenville, South Carolina, to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Shortly after the 4:02 p.m. takeoff, the pilot reported to air traffic control (ATC) that he had 5 hours of fuel. About 2.5 hours later, the pilot reported to Houston's air traffic control that the aircraft had run dry. In the cabin, band members saw the right engine flame out and cease, followed shortly by the left engine, leaving the horror-stricken travelers gliding silently thousands of feet above wooded terrain. The Convair crashed into the woods, killing band members Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, both pilots, and a road manager. Of the 26 aboard, 19 survived \u2014 likely because the fuel-starved aircraft didn't catch fire on impact. Witness testimony and other evidence suggested the poorly maintained right engine required more fuel to operate at proper parameters. Its operating switch had been set to auto-rich for several flights. Maintenance and flight crews failed to address the issue and perform procedures that may have diagnosed it, ultimately dooming one of rock's biggest acts in its prime.\n\nWhile helicopters are generally slower than fixed-wing craft, their unique hovering and landing capabilities make them invaluable. Today's fastest civilian helicopters, for instance, are widely used in tourism, particularly in densely populated areas like New York City. On April 10, 2025, a Bell 206-L helicopter took off from a Manhattan heliport with a family of five tourists and a pilot. The plan was to enjoy the skyline of New York, including a circle of the Statue of Liberty, before flying the Hudson River air route. However, as the chopper approached the Holland Tunnel, a series of loud noises signaled the disintegration of the airframe, leading to a fatal plunge of over 600 feet. The dramatic footage of the crash, coupled with the tragic loss of a family, captured global attention. Following the crash, divers and investigators retrieved wreckage from the river. A forensic examination, along with footage of the incident and eyewitness accounts, indicated that the helicopter's rear rotor detached, resulting in an immediate and irreversible loss of control. The FAA and NTSB have yet to issue a final report. Still, theories for the detached rotor include mechanical failure or a mast bump \u2014 an event during which the main rotor blade strikes the tail of the aircraft \u2014 as possible causes of the catastrophic damage.\n\nThe tragic death of Aaliyah, a rising star in the pop music world, sent shockwaves in 2001. At the tender age of 22, she had already left an indelible mark on the music industry. Little did she know that her promising career would be cut short when she boarded a Cessna 402B with eight other people. While Cessna builds larger private jets, its 402B is a twin-engined propeller-driven aircraft. The model involved in the crash had a certified maximum takeoff weight of 6,300 pounds and was designed to accommodate no more than 10 passengers and crew. The 4,117-pound empty weight of the aircraft, nearly 600 pounds of luggage, and 804 pounds of fuel, plus the weight of the people, combined for an estimated 1,000-pound surplus. Making things worse, the aircraft's center of gravity was 4.4 inches outside of the maximum limit. The crash of the overloaded Cessna, just after takeoff, was a preventable tragedy that claimed the lives of everyone on board. The technical root of the issue was a complex mixture of gravity, thrust, and lift, but it was human error that paved the way.",

      "text": "Which Is The Biggest Jet Cessna Makes?\nIn the minds of many enthusiasts, the Cessna name is likely linked with small planes. The brand's best-known model, the 172, even made it into our list of the most iconic airplanes in aviation history. However, the brand also builds the Citation range of business jets, which range in size from small regional jets to continent-crossing models. The largest of those is the Citation Longitude, which can fly for up to 3,500 nautical miles and carry up to 12 passengers. With two pilots and four passengers onboard, the Citation Longitude can fly from New York to London nonstop. The west coast of Africa and the northern third of South America (including cities like La Paz, Bolivia, and Lima, Peru) are also within reach.\nOne of the reasons that the famous Cessna 172 has been so successful is its low operating cost. It makes a great choice for a first plane, with operating costs running around $100 per flight hour for the most budget-conscious owners. Flying in a Citation Longitude will cost far more per hour, at $2,874, although Cessna claims it's the cheapest super-midsize private jet to run in terms of overall operating costs. The Longitude also boasts long maintenance intervals and can go for up to 18 months or 800 flying hours between scheduled services.\nHow much does a Cessna Citation Longitude cost?\nAs well as being cheaper to run compared to its rivals, the Cessna also alleges that the Citation Longitude has the quietest cabin in its class. It can also be optioned in a variety of configurations, although all these advantages come at a price. Cessna does not publicly disclose exact pricing figures for its top-spec jets, but reports pin the 2024 Citation Longitude's starting price at around $29.9 million. That's a significant investment, but it's still far less than many of the larger, more luxurious private jets favored by America's biggest celebrities. Many of these more lavish jets can cost three times the Cessna or more, with the costliest carrying nine-figure price tags.\nHowever, the Citation Longitude isn't pitched as a lifestyle jet for celebrities \u2014 instead, it's marketed towards corporate clients who use their jets to ferry their VIPs across the country for meetings and events. The jet's ability to fly between major global financial hubs without stopping, combined with its competitive operating costs, makes it a sensible choice for long-distance jaunts in the same way that Cessna's smallest planes remain a great choice for hobby flyers and learners."

      "text": "8 Surprising Things You Can Bring On A Private Jet (And 5 Things You Can't)\nNothing screams luxury more than having an entire plane cabin to yourself. With access to ample space and freedom, flying privately is one of the most convenient ways to move across long distances. There are many things you can do and find in private jets that are inaccessible on commercial airlines. Also, you don't have to worry about take-off times and flight schedules, and if you're a public figure, it offers you the added advantage of discretion. So it's unsurprising that businessmen, entertainers, and wealthy entrepreneurs opt for this means of travel when they can.\nAnother major perk of private jets is the fact that they are not subject to the long and strenuous security checks that commercial flights are infamous for. Many operators will let you know that you can bring a wide variety of items along. However, it's easy to wrongly assume that you can bring anything and everything on board. Private jets have governing rules as well, and while some operators are pretty lax, others have very strict guidelines that they operate by. With that said, here are eight surprising things you can bring on a private jet (and five things you can't).\nCan: firearms and hunting gear\nIf you have a planned hunting expedition on your next trip or feel the need to carry a firearm along, going private is actually a pretty good way to transport your gear. Like with commercial flights, this is not without restrictions. Of course, you'll need to have a license, and the laws in your destination would determine whether or not you can actually carry this kind of item along. If they do allow it, then all you need to do is inform your pilot and private jet operator ahead of time. They may also help with relevant documentation and compliance requirements.\nJust as in a commercial flight, your firearms would be unloaded and locked in a compartment during the flight, along with knives, fishing rods, archery sets, and other hunting materials. However, there are some advantages you get from opting to transport your firearms privately.\nThere's the obvious fact that you don't have to stand in long queues to get your items checked. In addition, you don't have to deal with strict and very limited restrictions on the weight of your items or the kind of luggage you can carry, which can be such a bummer when you have a lot to carry.\nCan: private chefs\nIf there's one thing you don't have to deal with on a private jet, it's the standardized and often unremarkable meals of commercial airlines. Dining on a private jet can be quite the experience, and you can enjoy in-flight gourmet offerings, whether provided by the aviation company or from personally hired staff.\nIn most cases, passengers would opt for what the company has to offer. Many private jet operators are luxury-oriented, given that they cater to a customer base of wealthy entrepreneurs, businessmen, and entertainers, so typically, you wouldn't have to worry about what to eat or drink. You may be offered a custom menu where you get to specify what you want to eat during your flight. In many cases, you may even request meals from specific restaurants, which the operator would arrange ahead of time. So while there's often no need for it, there's still usually the option to bring your private chef along. While chefs don't typically cook on board, they might help organize a menu, plan meals, or cater to your specific dietary needs on the flight.\nCan: various kinds of pets\nFlying along with your pet on a commercial flight usually means leaving the animal in the cargo hold or restricting it to a carrier for the duration. You may also face restrictions on the number, weight, or size of pets you can bring onboard. With private jets, while there are also rules, there are major benefits, plus you don't have to deal with hassle as much.\nYour pet can comfortably relax with you in the cabin and move about throughout the flight, although during take-off and landing, some operators request that it be leashed to the seat. Some attendants are trained in first aid for pets, and have been known to request ahead for the size, weight, and breed of your pet to properly prepare for how to take care of its needs. And yes, you can bring your hamster or bird along, although you may need approval for larger animals and breeds.\nBear in mind that vaccination requirements are still in place for pets that cross borders, so you'll need to get adequate documentation and certifications for your pets. Presenting this information for a private flight eliminates line-standing and checkpoints, ensuring a smooth and quicker process that is less stressful than the commercial experience for you and your pet.\nCan: oversized sports and musical instruments\nThere's a reason private jets are really common among entertainers and musicians \u2014 the convenience of carrying as much luggage as you need is trulyunmatched. With commercial airlines, there are restrictions on how many items you can carry as, even the length, width, and weight of each of these items. However, when flying private, you pretty much only have to worry about the cargo capacity of the plane.\nAs long as the private jet can accommodate it, based on its size and type, you can bring your items along. Very light jets, for instance, are meant for short trips and few passengers, so they can only accommodate small bags. However, with midsize jets, you can carry things like ski equipment and golf clubs, and large jets can even accommodate your musical instruments, several oversized suitcases, and snowboards. So there's really little to worry about, even when traveling in groups.\nCan: interior decoration\nIf you're going to spend hours moving across countries or states in a private plane, you might as well ensure you enjoy the visual appeal of your immediate environment. There are many occasions that warrant flying private, and personal taste can play a large role in how things look and come together on a jet.\nJets are typically designed to meet the high-end taste of customers, from leather seats to polished wood and fine tailoring, but you are also open to a range of customizations. For instance, if you have a wedding celebration, you can request floral designs along with soft lighting and colors that give off a romantic theme. For a business engagement, neutral tones and simple, ergonomic designs can meet the aesthetic. You can even have an interior design theme based on the seasons or festivities.\nAll these can generally be provided on request by the operator. However, you have the freedom to bring your own harmless design elements, like art pieces, simple decor, or balloons, as long as it is approved.\nCan: liquids in large quantity\nOne of the many restrictions that exist when flying commercially is the quantity of liquid and aerosols you can take on board. The TSA has a 3-1-1 liquid rule, which specifies that as a passenger, each liquid item you carry should not exceed 3.4 ounces, containers must fit into one quart-sized bag, and only one bag is allowed per passenger. This rule extends to creams, toothpaste, hairspray, soaps, colognes, and shampoos that can be carried in hand luggage.\nWhen you fly private, these rules are largely out the window. You can travel with your preferred liquids on board, whether drinks or toiletries. You can even bring alcohol, including champagne, whiskey, and cocktails, and this can even save you the cost of opting for the in-flight options. It also gives you the freedom to enjoy the brand of your choice.\nDifferent operators might, however, have rules and restrictions on the quantity and type of liquids you can bring onboard, and some might restrict you from drinking your alcohol during the flight.\nCan: human remains\nHuman remains might be one of the absolute weirdest things you can bring on a plane, and it may seem morbid to some, but it's really not uncommon for people to want to be buried in their ancestral homes or in specific locations when they pass away. This could be in an entirely different country, state, or continent from where they died. In such cases, one of the options you have is through a private jet charter.\nA private jet is even more convenient in cultures or religions where burials must be done expediently. In a Muslim burial, for instance, the deceased is buried within 24 hours and so requires prompt transportation. Some operators allow you to contact them on such short notice, during which you'll be given a quotation notice and have preparations made accordingly.\nThe deceased may be transported in the cargo hold or even in the passenger cabin, where family members can stay in close proximity. Note that some of the major considerations in these cases include the dimensions of the cabin door, the size of the aircraft, and the size of the coffin or casket.\nCan: personal entertainment\nFlights take several long hours, and this can get boring very fast. Entertainment is a pretty big deal for many passengers. On first-class commercial flights, customers get access to an array of options, from games to movies and TV. With the entire cabin to yourself, private jets offer you even more space, along with a more expansive range of entertainment options.\nDue to the fewer restrictions of private jets, you can bring almost every source of entertainment along, from toys to games and devices. Private jets typically offer free Wi-Fi, and with the high-definition screens on many modern flights, you can enjoy various movies and access to streaming. If you prefer, however, you can bring your own laptops or tablets instead.\nIt's also not uncommon to see virtual reality and augmented reality setups on modern jets. So, if you're traveling with a kid and hoping to keep them occupied or entertained throughout the flight, or you just need access to some fun stuff on the flight, you'll have little to worry about.\nCan't: harmful chemicals\nDespite the wide range of freedoms and luxuries allowed on private jets, you can't actually bring everything along. In fact, jet operators often require you to inform them ahead of time before bringing certain types of items on board, especially liquids. Commonly prohibited liquid include organic peroxides, such as bleaching agents. Most household cleaning chemicals are not allowed.\nMoreover, disabling things like pepper spray and mace is required due to their ability to cause harm. Less obvious are cooking oils, which, despite not being inherently dangerous, may also be prohibited on some jets. This could be due to various reasons, one of which is the likelihood of spills, leaks, and stains. When close to hot surfaces or electrical systems, they may also pose the risk of fire.\nMany of these items are categorized as hazardous materials (HAZMAT), and they are also subject to restrictions on commercial flights. While some private jets have a strict restriction policy for these items, others may allow some of them under specific guidelines.\nCan't: explosives and flammables\nIt goes without saying that explosives are a major hazard on flights. As a result, there are stringent prohibitions on these items. When you think of explosives, you might think of detonators and grenades, and while these are indeed strictly banned on planes, there are many more items that fall under this category. Fireworks are a popular one.\nFireworks include various kinds of pyrotechnic devices, including firework novelty items like Roman candles, firecrackers, ground spinners, smoke fireworks, and bottle rockets. So, if you're traveling for a festivity, a good tip to keep in mind is to purchase your fireworks locally. The explanation for this is simple: fireworks can ignite mid-flight and cause harm.\nApart from fireworks, petrol, solvents, paints, and lighter refills are also considered flammables and unsafe to carry along on a private jet. As far as aviation security is concerned, explosives and flammables could be in liquid, solid, or mixture, and they include any part, element, or chemical material that could be essential components of an explosive or flammable device, so long as it poses any danger to passengers, crew, or aircraft.\nCan't: Illegal substances\nSubstances like marijuana, despite being legal in different states and regions, are generally restricted on flights, whether private or commercial. In the United States, 42 states have legalized medical marijuana, and 24 allow recreational use. Still, marijuana is illegal on the federal level, and this means you wouldn't be able to fly with weed or other cannabis-infused substances.\nIn fact, it's illegal to possess or transport marijuana by virtue of the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and a breach of this can come with severe penalties. On top of that, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued strong warnings and significant fines to enforce passengers and pilots from transporting or smoking marijuana on flights.\nSmoking generally can be harmful on planes due to fire risks, but there's also the risk of contact high, which can affect members of the crew or the pilot. Justin Bieber's infamous incident in 2014, where he smoked marijuana on a private jet, actually forced the pilots to wear oxygen masks. So, in summary, any substances that are illegal to carry around or distribute would not only likely be disallowed but can also attract legal problems.\nCan't: infectious biological substances\nDue to the health risks that they carry, biological material is heavily regulated both nationally and internationally. Anything that could be infectious is generally subject to strict rules before it can be transported.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) is responsible for overseeing the transportation of materials considered hazardous. It classifies infectious substances into two types: things that, when they come in contact with otherwise healthy humans or animals, can cause life-threatening diseases or permanent disability, and things that generally aren't capable of such harm.\nItems like infected blood, bacteria, and viruses fall under the materials considered harmful and are usually subject to restrictions on flights. You would have to notify the operator if all such items are being transported, especially if they do not fall under exceptions, which include dried blood on absorbent material or biological material that no longer poses risks of infection. Some private jets also specifically cater to medical needs and facilitate the transportation of blood, organs, and medical supplies.\nCan't: red wine\nEven though wine is known to be less enjoyable in the air due to the dampened taste and aroma, sipping a glass still just seems like one of the many freedoms you should be able to enjoy on a private jet. And yes, you can enjoy a variety of wine options on your flight, but you might not be able to bring some red wine along.\nRed wine itself is a symbol of luxury and a favorite for many. However, it contains tannins, which are compounds that tend to cling to fibers. So, while it isn't illegal to bring along on most jets, companies often ban or restrict its use. Private jets have expensive and meticulously maintained interiors, and the risk of stubborn stains is a pretty big deal. During a bumpy ride, your wine can easily spill and create a mess that's troublesome to get rid of.\nSome operators might not prevent you from bringing red wine on board, but they would recommend or appreciate that you don't. Note that while you might have to forfeit this drink for the duration of your flight, you still at liberty to enjoy champagne, white wine, and many of your other favorite libations."

      "text": "Speed Demons: 9 Of The Fastest Private Jets In The Sky Today\nThere's no doubt that the life of the wealthy involves many benefits not available to ordinary folks. Access to VIP sections, World Series tickets, the best restaurant seats, the coolest cars out there, and fabulous homes are just a few of the perks. However, despite how much it costs, owning a private jet is perhaps the ultimate level of convenience and status. Airplanes are still the safest way to travel; celebrities use private jets to fly around the world without the worry and inconvenience of being mobbed in the airport. Executives use them to keep tabs on vast business empires. Politicians use them for diplomatic trips.\nA private jet can whisk you directly to wherever you want to go in a fraction of the time it would take to arrive commercially. Forget the lines at the TSA, or waiting at baggage claim \u2014 you can skip the onerous chores of traveling and fly just as fast as a commercial airline. Some private jets fly even faster than that.\nSo, if getting from Point A to Point B faster than anyone else is essential, which private jets do the job best? To find out, here's our list of 10 of the fastest private jets in the sky today.\nMeasuring power and speed\nDeciphering a jet's performance specs can be a tad tricky. Aircraft essentially need two things to fly: lift and thrust. Wings provide lift by creating an area of low pressure as air flows over them. Create more lift than you have weight and you're airborne. But another force at work wants to bring your airplane to the ground: drag. To defeat drag, an aircraft needs thrust.\nAirplanes must use thrust to overcome their drag the same way lift overcomes its weight. Most jet engines, therefore, are rated by the amount of thrust they provide, as it is a direct measure of how much a jet can carry and how fast it can take it. This brings us to Mach. Yes, when you ride a commercial jet, the speed is measured in miles per hour, but most aviation buffs speak in terms of Mach, or the speed of sound. Chuck Yeager taught us that sound travels 767 miles per hour \u2014 or Mach 1. The aviation industry measures aircraft speed in relation to Mach. So, double the speed of sound, or 1534 mph, is Mach 2, while half of it, 384 mph, is Mach 0.5.\nWhen an aircraft goes fast enough for supersonic flight, it creates a sonic boom, which is against the law in many countries for civilian aircraft. Therefore, private and commercial jets stay below that magical Mach 1 number.\nLearjet 75\nEveryone has a budget, and if the heavy-duty speed demons put too much of a crunch on the wallet, the frugal millionaire can opt for the Learjet 75. With a 2019 list price of a mere $14 million, the 75 might not be able to accommodate an entire baseball team, but it should still get you and six of your closest friends to Vegas lickety-split.\nThe Learjet 75 is a mid-sized jet with a relatively manageable estimated per-hour cost to fly of $1,785. For reference, heavy-duty private jets can cost up to $7,500 per hour. Powered by a pair of Honeywell TFE731-40BR jet engines with 3,850 pounds of thrust each, the 75 isn't going to break any records, but it's no slouch in the speed department. A max cruise speed of Mach 0.67 and a range of 2,040 nautical miles can see it across most of North America in a matter of hours.\nCessna Citation X+\nOne of the most recognizable names in private aviation, Cessna has been producing models of the Citation since 1972. Over the years, the jet has undergone several revamps, upgrades, and redesigns. Considered a Supermidsized jet, the Citation X+ may not be able to keep up with the heavies and their larger engines, but it's still a performer.\nBack in 2014, the Citation X+ earned the title of the fastest jet in general aviation by setting speed records for its 3-leg trip from Wichita to Seattle to Miami and back in the space of a single day. Cessna discontinued the Citation X+ after delivering only 29 of the updated airframes. The upgrades included a pair of Rolls Royce AE 3007 engines delivering 7,034 pounds of thrust each.\nWith a max speed of Mach .0935, Cessna's claim to be the fastest business jet in the sky has some credence. However, the max cruise speed is a more sedate 528 knots, or Mach 0.79. Still, for a midsize jet, the Citation X+ enjoys respectable speed while hauling up to 9 passengers and a crew of 2 to a range of 3,880 miles.\nGulfstream G650ER\nGulfstream is one of the best private jet manufacturers in the world, so it's no surprise that it produces some of the fastest jets in the sky today. Favored by executives and celebrities alike, the Gulfstream 650ER is famous for its customizable interior, high speed, and excellent range.\nThe ER stands for extended range, giving the 650ER the ability to travel 500 nautical miles farther than the standard G650. Of course, that number varies based on how heavily laden it is, but the G650ER can carry as many as eight passengers and four crew up to 7,000 nautical miles (about 8,000 miles) in a single leg \u2014 that's nearly a third of the way around the globe at the equator!\nDual Rolls Royce BR725 A1-12 engines give the aircraft up to 17,000 lbs of thrust each. But how fast does that translate to? The maximum speed for the GR650 is Mach 0.925, about 93% of the speed of sound, or 710 mph ground speed. However, top speed is not cruise speed, and it's never a good idea to run your jet at top speed for an entire flight. High-speed cruise on the G650ER is set at Mach 0.90, while the more fuel-efficient long-range cruise speed is Mach 0.85.\nBombardier Global 7500\nThe top of the Bombardier line is not just one of the largest and longest-range jets in the world; it's also amongst the fastest. Bombardier has four separate living spaces, a suite just for the crew (can't have them harshing your vibe with their spatial needs), and a full-size kitchen. With 2,637 cubic feet of interior volume, It's essentially an apartment in the sky with a $72 million price tag and a $6,000 per hour maintenance cost.\nFor that price, owners can take up to 19 passengers and between two and four crew members up to 7,700 nautical miles without refueling. A pair of GE passport engines give a combined 38,000 pounds of thrust, pushing the Global 7500's top speed in line with other heavy private jets. The Bombardier is capable of reaching Mach 0.925. Its average cruising speed is a tad slower, but still plenty fast, at Mach 0.85.\nGulfstream G500\nThe Gulfstream G500 may be the little sibling of the G650, but that doesn't mean it's slow. The G500 offers a high-speed cruise equal to the 650ER. First tested in 2015, the G500 is a tad smaller than the 650, with a total interior length of 47 feet. It accommodates up to 13 passengers, with sleeping space for as many as 6, depending on the buyer's chosen layout.\nThe G500 is powered by a pair of high-thrust Pratt and Whitney PG814GA engines, each of which produces around 15,000 pounds of thrust. Not quite as much as the G650ER, but with less plane to push, the engines are enough to deliver a top speed of Mach 0.925. Normal cruise speed has the G500 cutting through the air at Mach 0.85 and an economy cruise of Mach 0.73.\nSlower speed means increased range, and with the proper configuration, the G500 is capable of nonstop flight between Seattle and Seoul. Though less impressive than the long-range 650ER's 7,000 nautical mile range, the possibility of traveling 5,300 nautical miles without refueling is respectable.\nDassault Falcon 8x\nFrench aviation company Dassault not only has a place defending the skies of Europe with its Rafale fighter jet; it also builds a series of highly regarded business jets. While the Dassault Falcon 10x promises next-generation performance, the 8x has been delivering premium speed and range to discerning private jet owners since 2016.\nThe Falcon 8x has a range of 6,450 nautical miles (7,422 miles), nearly on par with the G650, and reaches a top speed of Mach 0.925. The Dassault 8X can connect New York to Beijing or London to Singapore without refueling.\nThe plane's high-speed cruising clocks in at Mach 0.90, while long-range cruising hits Mach 0.85, making it as fast as any private business jet of its generation. Unlike many of the jets on this list, the Falcon 8x has a triple-engine configuration with a trio of Pratt and Whitney PW307Ds, each supplying 6,722 pounds of thrust.\nBombardier Global 8000\nA new generation of private jets promises more range, higher speeds, and larger capacities, and the Global 8000 delivers. Bombardier's new flagship boasts a top speed of Mach 0.94, a tick faster than the previous generation. It may not seem like much compared to the Mach 0.925 to Mach 0.93 range of its older brethren, but its cruise speed makes the most significant difference.\nThe dual GE Passport 20 engines each deliver 16,500 pounds of thrust, which can propel the jet at an ultra-high speed cruise of Mach 0.92, not far from its overall top speed. High-speed cruise hits Mach 0.90 and a typical cruise speed sits at Mach 0.85. What's particularly interesting for the frugal private jet owner is that these incredible speeds are possible with an overall reduction in fuel burn of about 8% \u2014 pretty substantial savings without sacrificing speed.\nAnother benefit of the Global 8000 is its increased range. Although its capacity of 19 passengers is no greater than previous iterations of the Global line, a top-of-class 8,000 nautical miles makes the Global 8000 genuinely global.\nGulfstream G700\nGulfstream's upcoming addition to its heavy private jet stable is just a touch shy of the Bombardier Global 8000's promise. Its top speed of Mach 0.935 and 7,750 nautical mile maximum range set it high in its category, while just missing the new Bombardier's high water mark.\nA pair of Rolls Royce Pearl engines create 18,000 pounds of thrust each and carry it along at a comfortable Mach 0.90 cruise speed, and Mach 0.85 for long-range cruising. The G700 may not reach the highest echelons of speed, but it has the most extended cabin at 57 feet, with 8 feet of space from beam to beam and a maximum height of 6 feet, 5 inches.\nGulfstream lets clients choose their own layout, with up to five separate compartments, including a possible master suite with a shower. The G700 will require a crew of three to operate, which shouldn't be surprising considering it is one of the largest private business jets available.\nDassault Falcon 10 X\nDassault's most modern entry into the private jet market is in the sky, but it won't be available to consumers until 2025. Set to compete with the Bombardier Global 7500 and Gulfstream G700, the Falcon 10X will have a top speed of Mach 0.925 and be able to fly 7,500 nautical miles, making a hop between New York and Paris or Los Angeles possible.\nAll this greatness comes at a steep cost of $75 million, but Dassault claims it will offer more interior modularity than any other aircraft in its class. Its interior has the most significant dimensions: a cabin width of just over 9 feet and a 6-foot-8-inch height clearance.\nThe Rolls Royce Pearl 10X engines are still under development but represent the largest and most potent of the Pearl series, each delivering 18,000 pounds of thrust. Traveling at Mach 0.85, the 10x can carry up to eight passengers and four crew up to 7,500 nautical miles."

      "text": "Things You Can Find In Private Jets That Aren't In Commercial Planes\nEver since the first private jet in the world, the Learjet 23, took flight in 1963, the landscape of private jet aviation has undergone a profound transformation. Today, high-net-worth individuals choose convenience over money and prefer flying in private jets instead of commercial jets. The global private aviation sector is also booming, with projections suggesting the market will be worth $80.8 billion by 2034, with the U.S. taking the lead. Fun fact: Half of the private jets in the world are owned by Americans, with some of the biggest private jet airports also located in the U.S. Not only are private jets fast, they are also a safer means of travel than commercial planes.\nPrivate jets also are of different types: entry-level jets, light jets, super-light jets, mid-size jets, super mid-size jets, heavy jets, ultra-long-range jets, and airliners. The Bombardier Challenger 300/350 is globally the most used private jet. The most expensive one, the Bombardier Global 8000, costs roughly $78 million. That cost is just for the raw private jet. When you add personalization to the mix, the sky is the limit. But the question remains: Why are people investing so much in private jets? The answer is simple: comfort and amenities.\nOf course, a few airlines do offer several luxuries with their first-class and premium suites, but the amenities and customization that you get with a private jet are second to none. Which is what we will be discussing in this article, as we list things you can find in a private jet but not on commercial planes.\nComfortable and convertible seating area\nThe best part about flying in a private jet is that you have a dedicated seating area. The bespoke seating is nothing like the cramped rows of commercial airlines. The chairs are no ordinary ones; They are luxurious and comfortable. They are also movable and adjustable as per preference. While the seating capacity is based on the size of the private jet, most private jets offer individual seating, club-style seating with face-to-face arrangements, conference-style setups, or sofa-like lounges.\nSome private jets also offer reclining seats that can be converted into beds whenever required. Generally, private jets offer seats that can not only move but can also swivel and recline. These seats are crafted of high-quality materials (as with Gulfstream, which uses handcrafted leather) and other exceptional-quality fabrics. They are also ergonomically designed to provide the best comfort. For instance, Bombardier Global 7500 and 8000 jets' Nuage zero-gravity seating provides best-in-class comfort. Private jets also offer temperature-controlled seating and chairs with a massage function.\nOne benefit is that not only do you get comfortable seats that can move or convert into a bed, but there is ample space for you to stretch, walk around, and socialize, which is something you won't get on commercial first-class seats. Aside from the comforts that you get on private jet seats, they are also equipped with adjustable tablets, power outlets, and reading lamps, along with private entertainment displays. And you get these high-tech features in an environment of complete quiet and privacy, not possible on commercial flights.\nFull-Size bedrooms with King or Queen beds\nUnlike commercial airlines' first-class or premium suites, private jets not only provide comfortable seats but also offer a private, enclosed space dedicated to relaxing during long flights. Based on the type of private jet, you will find either a king or queen bed. But they can be of different shapes depending on the private jet's interior and the owner's preference. Since a complete bedroom on an aircraft requires a huge space and is mostly on the rear of the jet, you will find such luxurious bedrooms in heavy, ultra-long-range jets and airliners.\nPrivate jets, such as the Boeing Business Jet (777X, 737-Max, 787), the ACJ320neo, Embraer Lineage 1000E, Bombardier Global 7500/8000, Falcon 8X, and Gulfstream G650ER, among others, offer a full-size bedroom due to their ample cabin space. In midsize and super-midsize jets, sleeping facilities may be limited to convertible sofa-cum-beds or lie-flat seating, which may require additional bedding. However, whether it is a dedicated bedroom or a flexible arrangement, these sky bedrooms often come with plush furnishings, luxurious interiors, ambient lighting, and separate climate control.\nPrivate jet bedrooms can also be equipped with entertainment systems so that you can relax watching your favorite movie or show as you enjoy a premium experience 40,000 feet in the air. These private spaces may also come with a door for privacy, sleeping suits, slippers, carpets, and luxury bedtime skincare routine products. Large airliners such as the Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 can be configured with multiple bedrooms.\nFully-equipped full-size bathrooms\nWhile commercial airlines have those cramped lavatories, one of the best things about a private jet is that everything that you have onboard is for your private use. Which means you also get a private, full-size bathroom. Some jets may include multiple lavatories, but there is a provision of at least one private lavatory that is either connected to the bedroom or is located separately. For obvious reasons, large airliners offer better and more spacious bathrooms than mid-size or super-mid-size private jets.\nLight jets, such as the Cessna Citation CJ2 and Embraer Phenom 300, offer lavatories that are separated from all other spaces using hardwood or pocket doors. These can include a wash basin with a mirror, a flushable toilet, and some storage space. Mid-size and super-mid-size private jet interiors are more spacious, and along with standard fittings, they come with more storage and maneuvering space. They may also come with multiple basins.\nHeavy and long-range airliners are the ones where you will find full-sized lavatories, which will also include a full-size shower area. They are fitted with modern bathroom appliances, ambient lighting, mirrors, multiple wash basins, ample storage areas, and a dedicated closet. Luxury airliners such as Boeing Business Jets, ACJ (Airbus Corporate Jet), and Embraer's Lineage 1000E come with multiple bathrooms with spa facilities. Some may include a Turkish bath and other features like anti-bacterial surface treatments, a hands-free faucet in the sink, and a hands-free toilet flush.\nOnboard chefs and gourmet dining\nTraveling first class or in a premium suite gets you a wide range of eatery options. But those are standard, and you cannot ask for something made specifically for you. You have to order what's on the menu. But when traveling in a private jet, you have the option to hire your choice of catering service and eat what you like. You can expect gourmet meals and diverse cuisines, from non-vegetarian to vegan. Plus, you can have them serve you the best bottle of wine in the sky en route to your destination.\nYou can even take a 5-star chef with you on board your private jet and have him cook delicacies exclusively for you. Menus are fully customizable, and passengers can order signature dishes or specific cuisines as per their taste buds. As far as the kitchen equipment and dinnerware are concerned, that depends on the type of service that you have booked and the flight size. You can expect anything from glassware and steel utensils to silverware or even golden dinnerware.\nRefreshment centers are also part of large private jet interiors. Here, you can socialize with fellow passengers over a glass of the world's most expensive drink or enjoy your favorite cocktail served by a specialized bartender. This means you don't have to eat a tin-foil-packaged food but can have whatever you want to satisfy your hunger. The Bombardier Global 8000 is known to have the industry's best-equipped and largest kitchen.\nConference rooms\nFlying in a private jet isn't just about comfort; It is also about maximizing productivity. Private jets come with dedicated conference areas equipped to accommodate a good number of people. Typically, you will find a club seating arrangement with a conference table (oval, circular, or rectangular) at its center. Digital screens are also fitted for presentations, along with multiple power outlets to charge devices, Wi-Fi, and satellite phones that keep you connected even at 40,000 feet in the sky.\nUnlike a commercial airline, where meetings are virtually impossible, a private jet offers a quiet and private space, especially for business discussions. The size of the conference room depends on the aircraft category and type. Light jets may offer fold-out tables and swivel chairs, whereas midsized private jet interiors may allow for a small meeting space. If you want a luxurious, fully-equipped, and dedicated conference room, then large jets or business airliners are the ones to opt for.\nIn many jets, the dining room doubles as a conference room, thanks to convertible furniture and flexible layout. Aircraft like the Bombardier Global 7500 go a step further by offering a conference suite for six people with a table that spans the width of the jet. There is also a dedicated meeting space with sets of seats facing each other, along with a theater room that can also be used as a conference room.\nAdvanced entertainment systems\nOne aspect of a private jet interior that sets it apart from a commercial airline is the presence of advanced entertainment systems. Forget about the limited entertainment options you get in a regular airliner; When traveling in a private jet, you have access to high-speed Wi-Fi, allowing you to watch and enjoy content on your devices. Some of the major in-flight Wi-Fi providers include Inmarsat, Gogo, ViaSat, and others.\nBased on the aircraft category, a private jet may offer multiple LCD screens, superior audio systems, and a large divan or sofa set. Speaking of sound systems, the best you can currently get is on the Bombardier Global 7500/8000, thanks to Bombardier's l'Op\u00e9ra, which is the industry's most advanced and immersive audio system. The industry's largest TV, a 55-inch 4K TV, is also present inside the Bombardier Global 7500/8000.\nThere are also provisions to connect your favorite gaming console and have a one-on-one with your friend playing FIFA. To offer immersive entertainment, new-age private jets also provide AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality) experiences at the passenger's disposal, which can be used for interactive gaming as well.\nAmple cargo space\nPrivate jets don't only offer unparalleled luxury; They also bypass several limitations of commercial aircraft, one of which is cargo space. There are no restrictions on the amount of liquid that you can carry in private jets. You can carry certain goods that are banned on commercial planes, such as certain firearms, knives, hunting equipment, and even fishing gear. However, there are rules that you need to follow, and you also need to let the pilots know beforehand.\nThere is simply so much space that you don't have to follow the standard restrictions of a commercial flight. You can take your skis, snowboards, and expensive golf clubs all with you to your destination, but the more cargo, the larger the jet. Oversized luggage and fragile or valuable items such as musical instruments and paintings can also be safely brought inside a private jet.\nUnfortunately, if you were thinking of carrying your Rolls-Royce with you in a private jet, that is not possible. But certain large-sized private jets allow space for carrying your bicycle. Do note that you still have to go through security checks for certain items. It is also wise to check with your private jet operator about which items are allowed so that you can avoid unnecessary confusion. For those wanting extra space, the Embraer Lineage 1000 is known to have the biggest luggage storage space of any private jet.\nPersonalized cabin climate control\nBeyond comfortable sofas, flat beds, and elegant divans, private jets offer something extremely important yet often overlooked: individual climate controls for the cabin. Maintaining a comfortable cabin climate and optimal altitude pressure only enhances the private jet travel experience.\nCabin altitude pressure refers to the simulated pressure that your body feels while flying. Usually, private jets maintain a cabin pressure equivalent of 4,000-6,000 feet, which is much lower than the 6,000-8,000 feet of cabin pressure typically maintained by commercial flights. The benefits? You get fewer headaches, more oxygen, and you are less tired, as the pressure is almost similar to ground level. Personalized temperature control also allows passengers to be in their comfort zone. Some private jets allow for separate climate control settings for different cabins.\nMeaning, you can keep your bedroom at a cozy temperature while you can keep things cool in the kitchen. Private jets are also equipped with HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filtration systems, which, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, \"remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns (\u00b5m).\" This ensures that the environment inside the aircraft is healthy.\nCustom decor and interiors\nIf you have money and you own a private jet (or several, like many celebrities), then whatever you have in your imagination can be done with the interior. You can go berserk and have your private jet's interior look like a 5-star hotel or a penthouse in the sky. For instance, you can take inspiration from how Lufthansa Technik AG, in collaboration with Boeing Business Jets (BBJ), unveiled the \"CelestialSTAR,\" its VVIP cabin concept for the BBJ 777-9.\nIn simple words, you can have the world's most comfortable bed, multiple sofas, a TV, a fully equipped kitchenette, and other accessories draped in the best furnishing materials. You can go for a different layout and choose whether to have multiple bedrooms or washrooms, or want a conference room along with an entertainment suite.\nOr, you can opt for something like London-based design firm Winch Design that completely revamps the interior of the private jet using its original layout. If you want your private jet to stand out, you can get involved in choosing the fabric material, appliances, taps, lighting, window shades, and every other granular aspect of the aircraft you can imagine.\nCrew rest areas\nJust like the passengers onboard want their shut-eye, the crew, including the pilot of the aircraft, also need to have some rest during long-haul flights. Certain rest rules for pilots and other crew members impact flight times, duty days, and hours at the controls in order to maintain alert pilots and aircrew, including flight attendants. Private jets may come with flight attendants, but it depends on various factors.\nAccording to the FAA, flight attendants aren't required on an aircraft that has 19 or fewer passenger seats, but with an appropriate certificate, private jet operators can add flight attendants. The number of flight attendants also depends on the size of the flight. Large private jets have dedicated crew rest areas where the attendants, including the pilot, can rest if the flight hours exceed duty hour limits.\nAlthough private jets generally won't go for a flight of 15,332 km (the world's longest flight by Singapore Airlines), they come with dedicated spaces for crew to sit and relax, which could include a foldable chair or a jump seat, on either the left or right side of the cabin door or the main door.\nPet-friendly accommodation\nPets on a commercial flight come with limitations. Your pet needs to be of a specific size and breed, and also they need to be inside their pet carrier, under the seat, or in front of you. You need to pay extra charges for carrying your pet on a commercial flight. This could be a traumatic experience for your pet, as they are treated like luggage. However, if you are traveling via a private jet, your pet will have the ultimate luxury of roaming around the cabin, in full freedom, without any limitations.\nPrivate jets offer a safe and comfortable space for your pets. There are also relaxed rules for pets, meaning you could bring pets of all sizes and breeds. Also, they can be fed their favorite food on board, and private jets are open to host multiple pets at once. Traveling with pets on a private jet also means that you can bypass the stringent pet documentation and other health certificate requirements often required in commercial aircraft.\nSince the pet will be traveling with you inside the cabin, you won't have to worry about the climate conditions. The private jets also depart on your schedule, meaning you have ample time to get your pet ready for showtime."

      "text": "10 Of The Fastest Civilian Helicopters, Ranked By Top Speed\nSince its groundbreaking invention in 1939, the helicopter has steadily transformed the world of transport, though it took a decade or two to really reach its potential. The Korean War served as the first large-scale stage of the helicopter when the Bell 47, one of the most iconic military helicopters in history, proved to be a literal lifesaver as it transported the wounded from the battlefield to hospitals in rear areas.\nFrom its military roots, the helicopter has branched out into many civilian applications. Its unique ability to hover, attain high speed, and requirement for a small landing footprint make it a perfect fit for a wide range of tasks. Today, modern civilian helicopters are involved in everything from transporting donated organs to ferrying CEOs and pop stars to rescuing stranded adventurers and aiding law enforcement in chasing down criminals.\nThough often spoken of in the same breath as airplanes, helicopters, as a general rule, are not as fast as their fixed-wing siblings. Some of the fastest private jets in the sky today can achieve upward of 700 mph, but most helicopters operate between 150 and 160 mph. While those speeds might not raise many eyebrows, the pure utility of helicopters makes them an integral part of today's transportation network.\nIn honor of the helicopter's convenience and life-saving service, we examine some of the fastest choppers on the civilian market, ranked by top speed.\nBell 407 \u2014 161 mph\nFounded in Buffalo, New York on July 10, 1935, Bell is one of the oldest aviation firms in the country. The company initially focused on building fixed-wing fighter planes like the P-39 Airacobra but pivoted to helicopters with the Model 30 in 1941. The Bell 47 model performed some of the same duties as the later Army workhorse Huey helicopter did in the skies over the battles of the Korean War , and the company is still in the chopper business all these years later.\nThe Bell 407 has more than a quarter century of history, with the first production bird taking flight in November 1995. The modern version uses a Rolls-Royce 250-C47E/4 turbine engine, which makes 862 shaft horsepower (shp). Depending on its configuration, it can accommodate one pilot and up to six passengers as long as it does not exceed its maximum gross weight limitation of 5,250 pounds (6,000 pounds with an external load).\nWith a maximum cruise speed of 153 mph, the Bell 407 is a quick ride, even though it may not match the speed of the fastest civilian birds or the power of military airframes. Bell rates the Vne speed \u2014 aviation jargon for the maximum safe speed an airframe should not exceed, even in a dive \u2014 at 161 mph.\nAirbus H125 \u2014 176 mph\nFirst introduced in 1974 as the A\u00e9rospatiale AS350, the H125 has had a long and storied career. A member of the Ecureuil family of Airbus helicopters, it was built under the name Eurocopter and was previously known as the AS350 Squirrel and AS350 AStar. In 2015, Airbus tweaked its naming conventions. Since then, it has operated as the H125.\nIrrespective of its name, the helicopter stands out for its adaptability and agility as a single-engine chopper, earning praise for its smooth operation and diverse mission capability. At the heart of the H125 is a Safran Arriel 2D engine generating 952 shp at takeoff power. The H125 boasts a maximum takeoff weight of 5,225 pounds (6,173 pounds with an external load). It can house up to two pilots and six passengers, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of tasks.\nAirbus offers variations of the H125 tailored for search and rescue, law enforcement, firefighting, and powerline missions. At maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), it can cover a range of up to 340 nautical miles (NM) and operate for 4 hours and 27 minutes at a fast cruise speed of 156 mph. This makes it one of the fastest police helicopters on the market, although most departments likely do not utilize its maximum speed of 176 mph.\nSikorsky S-76 \u2014 178 mph\nAside from life-saving capabilities, helicopters are often used to transport high-profile individuals. The Sikorsky S-76, introduced in 1977, is a prime example of this. It has been the preferred mode of transportation for heads of state, serving as the primary heli transportation for 10 nations. It has ferried everyone from CEOs to oil-rig roughnecks heading offshore, cementing its status as a versatile people hauler.\nFor helicopter enthusiasts, the S-76 may ring a bell as the civilian counterpart of the UH-60 Blackhawk, known for its roles in Black Hawk Down and Operation Neptune Spear. The S-76 shares a similar mechanical structure with its military sibling, but it focuses more on comfortable transportation. It also serves as an air ambulance and search-and-rescue platform. One of its key features is the ability to fly with a single pilot, reducing costs for corporations and other for-profit organizations. With a 12-person capacity, this mid-sized chopper is not just a mode of transportation but a party bus in the sky.\nThe S-76C++/ model uses two Arriel S2S engines that deliver 923 shp at maximum takeoff power and 853 shp in operation. The top-of-the-line S-76D replaces those with 1,077 shp Pratt & Whitney PW210S turboshafts. Sikorsky sets the maximum speed at 178 mph, making it a pretty speedy helicopter for all of your CEO-hauling needs.\nBell 429 \u2014 178 mph\nOnce again, Bell takes a prominent place with the versatile Bell 429, a helicopter that shares its American roots with the S-76. This adaptable aircraft is a key player in various sectors, including VIP transport, public safety, helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), and the energy field. Its customizable cabin is designed with a focus on comfort and quiet operation.\nThe Bell 429 has its roots in a previous generation of helicopters. It was developed from the Bell 206L LongRanger and 400/440 TwinRanger of the mid-1980s. With development reaching back to those choppers, Bell introduced what would become the 429 at the 2005 Heli-Expo as the GlobalRanger. It went operational in 2009, primarily as a medical helicopter.\nWith a fuel capacity of 217 gallons, the standard Bell 429 has a range of approximately 425 miles and a typical cruising speed of between 172 and 178 mph, depending on conditions like weather and load. The 429 weighs 4,465 pounds empty and boasts a maximum internal load of up to 3,255 pounds, with an additional 3,000 pounds of cargo hook capacity. However you load it, the 429 can't take off weighing more than 8,000 pounds total.\nLeonardo AW139 \u2014 192 mph\nLeonardo da Vinci's creations \u2014 some of which you may not have realized he invented \u2013 covered nearly every conceivable genre of study. He famously designed (but never built) a helicopter-like contraption we know as the aerial screw. This is why Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica chose the name Leonardo when it rebranded in 2017. It claims to have been inspired by Da Vinci's genius for systemic thinking. The Leonardo AW139 is one product of the company's approach to aviation.\nGeared up to service the medical, security, and energy fields, the AW139 is a sizable helicopter capable of carrying one to two crew members and as many as 15 passengers. Of course, not all configurations prioritize passenger transport. In a medical configuration, it can accommodate two stretchers, up to five medical personnel, and a full suite of life-support equipment.\nThe AW139 is a high-performance helicopter with an overall length of over 54 feet (rotors included) and a height of 16 feet. Its maximum gross weight is 14,110 pounds, and its maximum range is 737 miles. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney PT6C-67C turboshaft engines, each capable of producing up to 1,700 hp, the AW139 can reach speeds of as much as 192 mph at maximum output.\nAS365 Dauphin \u2014 201 mph\nThis one is a little sneaky, as the AS365 Dauphin \u2014 formerly of Eurocopter and now of Airbus \u2014 is used for a quasi-military mission. The Dauphin is the helicopter you've seen in movies rescuing mariners in distress as the Coast Guard's primary rescue platform. The Coast Guard, although primarily a military organization, is technically under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security, a civilian agency. This is why we're calling it a civilian helicopter, so we can include it on this list for being speedy and cool.\nThe Dauphin has been in service with the Coast Guard since 1984, when the HH-65A debuted in its original version. Since then, various upgrades have kept it in service until the present day. Overall, the MH-65, as it is known now, has logged over 1.7 million hours of flight time for the Coast Guard. It has to be rugged and reliable, as lives depend on its successful operation.\nThe latest MH-65 is a dual-engined machine utilizing a pair of Arriel 2C/2C2 engines, each of which makes 853 shp. It's a powerful machine that can cruise at an impressive 170 mph and reach a maximum speed of 201 mph. If you're waiting in the water for a rescue, you might want the crew to risk pushing it that hard.\nAirbus Racer \u2014 252 mph\nThe 200 mph mark is rarified air for the civil helicopter arena, and companies are pressing to develop machines that reach higher speeds than ever. The Airbus Racer is something of an experimental airframe, and not (yet) ready for civilian mass production, but it shows enormous potential.\nCurrently, Airbus uses the Racer as a testbed for technology that could enter the market. One of its main focuses is developing an aerodynamic airframe. That's a goal of any aviation company, but just looking at the Racer clues viewers in on its next-gen potential. Aside from a sleek design, it features a pair of box-wing outriggers equipped with additional rotors and a twin-boom tail that forgoes the typical rear rotor setup.\nThe Airbus team set a goal of reaching a fast cruise speed of 253 mph, which it achieved within two months of the Racer's first flight. Test pilot Herv\u00e9 Jammayrac later pushed it up to an impressive 260 mph. It achieved its incredible speed in part due to a design that produces a drag coefficient in the same range as Airbus's smallest models despite its larger size.\nAdvanced aerodynamics is all well and good, but there's no replacement for power, and the Racer has it in spades. A pair of Safran Aneto-1X engines each make 2,500 shp \u2014 25% more than engines of similar volume. The potential of the Racer is yet to be maximized, but it looks like a promising upcoming addition to civilian aviation.\nSikorsky X2 \u2014 288 mph\nAirbus isn't the only aviation firm looking to break new barriers in the pursuit of speed. Sikorsky, under the ownership of Lockheed Martin, has its own experimental prototype. The X2 employs a non-traditional design to explore the helicopter's potential in a unique way.\nThe X2 uses a pair of rotors, one mounted above the other, similar to Russia's KA-52, the answer to America's AH-54 Apache attack helicopter. It's called a coaxial rotor system, and each main rotor can rotate and tilt in opposite directions. The system makes the X2 a marvel of maneuverability, as the counter-rotating blades can work in opposition to each other for faster turns. Think of tank treads turning in the opposite direction to spin.\nWhile the coaxial rotors catch the eye first, what may go unnoticed is a pusher propellor, referred to as a propulsor, settled between the twin-boom tail. The propulsor helps the X2 get up to speed quickly and excel at low-level flight. Unlike some of the other fast helicopters on this list, the X2 is a single-engine design, using an LHTEC T800-LHT-801. The Light Helicopter Engine Turbine Company, a joint venture between Honeywell and Rolls-Royce, builds it. The engine makes 1,340 hp and drove the X2 to 288 mph in September 2010.\nAlthough the X2's design was initially intended for use in conflict zones, Sikorsky has not ruled out the possibility of introducing this advanced technology to the civilian market if there is a demand. This potential expansion of the X2's applications is something that aviation enthusiasts can hope for.\nEurocopter X3 \u2014 294 mph\nIf the X2 is good, the X3 must be better, right? Unfortunately, for aeronautical engineers, it's not that easy, though in this case there's some truth to the supposition. The Eurocopter X3 is considered a gyrodyne, a helicopter/plane hybrid. Like the CV-22 Osprey or the AW609 in the next section, it can take off and land like a helicopter but operates more like a fixed-wing aircraft while in flight, albeit a tad differently from a tilt-rotor craft.\nThe X3 uses a primary rotor like a helicopter for vertical operation and a pair of outrigger engines similar to the Airbus Racer for forward motion. The rear rotor is replaced by a pair of turboprop engines that quickly push it up to speed. It could only accommodate two people and was primarily envisioned for search and rescue operations in which speed is a life-saving (or denying) factor. There are no plans to utilize the X3 for transport missions.\nIn 2011, the X3 broke records by achieving a cruising speed of 267 mph using only 80% of its power. Three years later, in June 2013, it reached a top speed of 300 mph before the pilot reined it down to a cruise of 293 mph.\nAlas, the day of the X3 is already over. After 199 test flights from which engineers gleaned reams of data, the airframe was retired and now lives a peaceful existence as an exhibit at the Bourget National Air and Space Museum outside of Paris.\nLeonardo AW609 \u2014 310 mph\nLeonardo makes the list again, and the design of the AW609 would likely make its namesake proud. There is a space between helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, most famously occupied by the game-changing CV-22 Osprey used by military organizations. Leonardo hopes to bring the hybrid tilt-rotor aircraft to the civilian world.\nAt a glance, the AW609 is clearly not your typical helicopter. Its engine nacelles remain vertical for takeoff and landing and then tilt to horizontal for flight. This allows it to achieve speeds rivaling fixed-wing aircraft while maintaining the convenience and small landing footprint of a helicopter. It also doesn't require a runway, so landing pads on hospitals or hovering over a sinking ship is very much in its wheelhouse.\nLeonardo envisions the AW609 as having energy services and private transport applications but has especially high hopes in time-critical situations like search and rescue and medical evacuation. Its high-speed capability could save lives when seconds count.\nIt is not just speed at which the AW609 excels. It can achieve up to 25,000 feet of altitude \u2013 higher than many helicopters can fly \u2014 and features a comfortable, pressurized cabin. It is also specially designed to fly safely in icing conditions that could ground other aircraft, another testament to its potential under adverse weather conditions. The engines are the same Pratt & Whitney PT6C-67A turboshafts found in Leonardo's AW139, but in this unique configuration, they can push the AW609 up to 310 mph."
