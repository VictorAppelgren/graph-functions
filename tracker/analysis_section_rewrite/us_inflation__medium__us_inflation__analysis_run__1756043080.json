      "feedback": "The draft does a solid job stitching policy, AI/alt‑investments, and some real‑world datapoints, but to reach world‑class quality it needs a sharper, fully articulated 3–6 month catalyst map, tighter causal logic, and rigor on numbers and sources. Actionable edits: 1) Build a explicit 3–6 month catalyst map anchored to 1) policy progress on the “Big Beautiful Bill” (tax cuts ~$4.4 trillion over 10 years and debt impact ~$4 trillion) and its likely timing, 2) RNC leadership impact from Gruters’ stance and any midterm messaging cadence, 3) NC Senate primary dynamics and fundraising tempo, and 4) AI/healthcare adoption milestones (HeartSciences FDA/Medicare paths) with concrete windows (e.g., regulatory milestones, reimbursement decisions, tender/coverage cycles). State the linkages clearly: policy momentum → macro variables (growth, inflation, debt dynamics) → asset pricing/risk premia. Use explicit time windows (e.g., 0–6 weeks, 6–12 weeks, 3–6 months) and note path‑dependence (e.g., if OBBB moves faster, debt dynamics tighten; if stalled, discount rate and capex signals stay muted). 2) Upgrade the scenario structure: present Base Case, Bull Case, and Bear Case with at least one preferred path and 1–2 alternates, each with trigger counts, probability weights, and expected P/L style implications for risk assets and selective AI/real‑asset exposures. Include a one‑paragraph “path to invalidation” for each scenario (e.g., if debt/GDP breaches a critical threshold or if Medicaid work‑requirements face legal challenges, etc.). 3) Deepen the first‑principles grounding and transmission: articulate why debt dynamics and growth policy matter for rates, financial conditions, and equity risk premia; quantify the plausible macro impulse from productivity gains via AI (cite Range/Batra figures only as a qualitative guide unless you can quote numerics from the sources; otherwise keep ranges and label as sensitivity). 4) Quantify with precision and consistency: extract and present concrete numbers from sources (EPJYXB7DX; FOM34PUWA; V8TEZOR8R; UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F) in compact bullets: e.g., 97% rise in UAS jobs (712→1,400) with avg salary ~$105,912; Pacaso growth metrics (21% YoY gross volume, 24% EBITDA lift, 1.8T addressable vacation‑home market expansion); HeartSciences’ Medicare reimbursement starting 2025 and FDA path to 2026 revenues; Douglas Tires: typical 40k–60k miles, 50k warranty. 5) Reconcile conflicts and cover critical sources: acknowledge CBO/CRFB debt/tax‑cut estimates (EPJYXB7DX) vs. broader debt dynamics, and explicitly call out any uncertainties or data quality issues in UAS and consumer‑durables data (FOM34PUWA; V8TEZOR8R); ensure every key claim ties to a source ID and avoid overreaching claims (e.g., don’t extrapolate equity returns beyond stated ranges). 6) Structure the narrative to match the SECTION FOCUS: present the catalysts with timing, the macro/policy/positioning channels, and 1–2 alt paths with defined invalidation points; end with a clean Base Case, 1–2 Alternatives, explicit risks, watch‑list signals, and a concise confidence assessment (cite sources after the related claims: EPJYXB7DX; ILYC1M41F; UPV3X2MQ6; FOM34PUWA; V8TEZOR8R). 7) Improve readability and guardrails: remove or relegate tangential items (e.g., broad consumer‑durable anecdotes without direct market transmission) unless you can tie them to pricing/consumption channels; keep all numeric assertions sourced and avoid generic statements. This will tighten causal coherence, improve scenario fidelity, and raise the piece to world‑class analytic standard. (EPJYXB7DX; ILYC1M41F; UPV3X2MQ6; FOM34PUWA; V8TEZOR8R)",
