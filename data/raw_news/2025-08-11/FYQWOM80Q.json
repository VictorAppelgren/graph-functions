  "description": "LA officials are trying to put the brakes on deadly street takeovers running riot across the City of Angels.",
  "content": "Authorities tired of street meet-up scofflaws driving circles around them moved to put the brakes on the deadly pastime Monday by pushing for stiffer penalties for the criminals.\n\nTinseltown has been plagued in recent years by the illegal gatherings, organized on secretive social media channels, in which hooligans in cars take over public roadways for donuts, burnouts and other stunts.\n\nThe locations are broadcast on private social media, and organizers can make big money promoting wannabe speed demons on their channels, authorities said.\n\n\u201cThese reckless stunts are terrorizing our local communities, sometimes leading to death and often leading to looting, vandalism and other crimes,\u201d LA District Attorney Nathan Hochman told reporters at a press conference Monday.\n\nHochman spoke after 40 to 50 cars took over the street in front of Crypto.com Arena, home of the LA Lakers in the wee hours Saturday.\n\nIn April, county officials agreed to double the fine for participating in street takeovers, making it $1,000, plus up to 90 days in jail. Even spectators could land fines and jail time.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough for Hochman.\n\n\u201cI would ask the Board of Supervisors to keep ratcheting up the penalties,\u201d he said at LA\u2019s Hall of Justice, calling for a fine of $2,500 for the second offence and $5,000 for the third.\n\nHe also warned that a would-be speed demon\u2019s car might end up in a city scrap pile.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a driver and you want to see that car crushed, literally crushed as we impound it, go ahead and test us,\u201d Hochman said.\n\nOn Friday, a judge sentenced Dante Chapple-Young to 13 years in prison for slamming his car into a crowd of people while doing donuts at a street takeover in 2022, killing 24-year-old Elyzza Guajaca.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been long and hard for me and my family,\u201d Guajaca\u2019s mother Lorraine told reporters at the press conference Monday, fighting back tears. \u201cWe have put [the driver] where he belongs.\u201d\n\nThree people have died in street takeovers this year, authorities said.\n\n\n\nThe LA Police Department has intervened in 517 street takeovers since January, but officers only show up at around one in four of the incidents the department is alerted to, according to LAPD Deputy Chief Donald Graham.\n\n\n\nGraham explained that going in guns blazing can make the situation even more dangerous.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you interdict too hard, now you\u2019ve got 150 cars fleeing from a location at 100 miles an hour, which creates a whole other problem,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nGraham also said illegal street mobs are becoming more vicious \u2014 both for civilians and the officers trying to break them up.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it was when I was doing street racing enforcement back in the early 2000s, when you showed up with two or three black-and-whites with the lights on and everybody took off,\u201d he continued, explaining that even the act of calling for backup \u201cbecomes a real danger for [officers] as crowds of two to three hundred turn on those black-and-whites.\u201d\n\nCops are working to monitor the social media channels that broadcast info about upcoming takeovers, and organizers may face felony conspiracy charges.\n\n\n\nBut the organizers usually broadcast on private pages or encrypted messaging apps, and they make last-minute changes to throw the cops off their trail, Graham said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have our means [of investigating], and some of them I can\u2019t get into here in an open forum, but it is more complicated than simply \u2018Oh, did you see what\u2019s on your Insta?'\u201d\n\nThe LA County Board of Supervisors also plans to send letters to social media companies warning them to crack down on street takeover organizers \u2014 and threatening to hold them liable for the death and destruction if they don\u2019t comply.",

      "text": "Illegal migrant who raped, killed Rachel Morin sat emotionless at sentencing in front of her anguished family\nThe Salvadorian illegal migrant who viciously raped and killed Rachel Morin was emotionless as her grieving children remembered their \u201ckind\u201d and \u201cdetermined\u201d mom at his sentencing Monday \u2014 where he was given life without the possibility of parole.\nHarford County Circuit Court Judge Yolanda Curtin threw the book at Victor Martinez-Hernandez, 24, after an hours-long hearing Monday where Morin\u2019s family members, including four of her five children, delivered emotional victim impact statements.\nMorin\u2019s eldest daughter described her mom, who has the \u201cbest laugh,\u201d as \u201ckind, strong, honest, determined and funny,\u201d in a heartbreaking written statement she asked the prosecutor to read to the court, WBAL-TV reported.\n\u201cI had to relive the worst two days of my life in order to write this,\u201d the statement from the 20-year-old read.\nHer three youngest children delivered their statements via audio recordings.\n\u201cShe was a good mom,\u201d her son could be heard saying in one recording. \u201cEvery time I see a picture of her I think about the life I had with her and my four sisters. I miss her.\u201d\nMorin\u2019s children range in age from 9 to 20.\n\u201cYou took a life that was not yours to take,\u201d the judge told Martinez-Hernandez, according to WBAL-TV. \u201cYour acts not only brutalized a young woman but also terrorized a community.\n\u201cYou are not a candidate for rehabilitation. There is simply no hope to rehabilitate you.\u201d\nA jury found Martinez-Hernandez guilty in April of murdering Morin, 37, as she was exercising on the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail in Bel Air, Maryland, on Aug. 5, 2023.\nHe strangled her and then bashed her head against rocks before hiding her partially naked body in a drainage culvert on the trail that is about 30 miles northeast of Baltimore.\nMorin\u2019s younger brother, John Morin, said through tears Monday that he\u2019s experienced a \u201ctidal wave of grief\u201d since his sister\u2019s slaying, according to a post on X by ABC 2 reporter Blair Sabol.\nMartinez-Hernandez remained stony-faced and emotionless as the family members told the judge about the toll that Morin\u2019s murder had taken on the family.\nAfter, through a Spanish translator, Martinez-Hernandez addressed the judge, thanking her \u201cfor the opportunity to speak\u201d but that he would \u201cnot be giving any testimony.\u201d\nMorin\u2019s mother, Patty Morin, told the court she has suffered nightmares, panic attacks, and insomnia since her daughter\u2019s death.\n\u201cThe depths of grief are equivalent to the depths of love felt,\u201d Patty said. \u201cThis will impact generations to come.\u201d\nAhead of the sentencing, the heartbroken mom told Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that she didn\u2019t know if she wanted to hear from her daughter\u2019s murderer at the sentencing, because she would never really know if an apology was simply a bid for a lighter penalty.\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know, because even if he spoke, would I believe what he said?\u201d Patty said. \u201cIf he said he was sorry, could I believe that he actually is or if he\u2019s just saying that to you know, to hope for a lesser sentence.\u201d\nThe killer wasn\u2019t captured until nearly a year later in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June 2024, after investigators were able to match the DNA taken from his sock to the DNA found at the crime scene.\nHe was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree rape, first-degree sexual offense and kidnapping and faced up to life in prison. He didn\u2019t face the death penalty as the Free State doesn\u2019t allow capitol punishment.\nMartinez-Hernandez entered the country illegally after allegedly slaying another woman in his home country of El Salvador.\nMorin\u2019s killing gained national notoriety as an example of former President Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous border policies.\nPatty was outspoken against Biden for his policies, which she blamed for the fact that Martinez-Hernandez was able to get into the country and kill her daughter.\nThe murder of Laken Riley also made headlines as Jose Ibarra, a Tren de Aragua gang member, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for slaying the promising 22-year-old nursing student on Feb. 22, 2024, in Georgia."

It is decentralized and operates independently of a central bank.\nUnlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by a physical commodity or government, and their value is determined by market demand and supply. Cryptocurrencies can be used to buy goods and services, transfer funds, and trade in markets. Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Cronos.\nMany cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are created through a process called mining, which involves solving complex mathematical equations to validate and record transactions on a blockchain. This mechanism is also called Proof of Work (PoW). Another consensus mechanism that has increased in popularity \u2014 as it is more energy efficient \u2014 is Proof of Stake (PoS). Instead of mining, PoS relies on network participants validating transactions. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, uses this consensus mechanism.\nUnlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by a physical commodity or government, and their value is determined by market demand and supply.
