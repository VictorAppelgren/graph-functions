      "feedback": "The draft is largely on‑target but a few sentences drift from a direct, citation‑backed causal link to the S&P 500. 1) In the “sticky inflation” sentence, add an explicit clause such as “… erodes S&P 500 earnings and raises the equity discount” and keep the (FAN5RYW6T) citation. 2) In the “stronger dollar” sentence, replace “increases FX risk for U.S. equities” with “increases FX risk for the S&P 500” and keep (XTQIQRP5K). 3) Ensure every sentence ends with a citation that supports the stated impact on the S&P 500 (e.g., add (B1KYJ1GPU) to the Fed‑cut lift sentence if not already present). 4) Remove any extraneous clauses that do not directly tie back to the index (e.g., “which would signal weakness” can stay but should be linked to the S&P 500 impact). 5) Tighten the paragraph to 4–6 bullet points: (i) concentration risk (FAN5RYW6T); (ii) Fed‑cut lift (B1KYJ1GPU, Z7O1DCHS7, 97MD1FHW8, 3YAQ8JUPL); (iii) inflation/tariff headwinds eroding earnings (FAN5RYW6T); (iv) stronger dollar FX risk (XTQIQRP5K); (v) 2‑yr/10‑yr spread warning (Z7O1DCHS7); (vi) watch signals (FAN5RYW6T, XTQIQRP5K).  This keeps each line a concise, evidence‑based view of the S&P 500 with explicit causal links and proper citations.",
