  "title": "Why ESIM Adoption Is Still So Slow\u2014And What Needs To Change",
  "description": "If we want eSIM to become the global norm, we must encourage user-first design, transparent pricing and clear, consistent education.",
  "content": "When eSIM technology entered mainstream devices\u2014first in smartwatches, then in iPhones and Android devices\u2014it was heralded as the next evolution in mobile connectivity. By allowing users to activate a cellular plan without physically inserting a SIM card, eSIM promised seamless, digital onboarding.\n\nAnd yet, in 2025, eSIM adoption remains tepid in many consumer markets. For a technology with obvious advantages, that's puzzling.\n\nAs the CEO of a global digital connectivity provider, I've spent the last few years working at the intersection of telecom infrastructure and user experience. What I've learned is simple. It's not the technology that's broken; it's the outdated, fragmented ecosystem surrounding it.\n\neSIM Works\u2014So Why Isn't The World Using It?\n\neSIM technology streamlines onboarding, reduces manufacturing waste and makes switching between carriers frictionless. From a consumer experience and logistics standpoint, it's a no-brainer.\n\nSo why do most mobile users still rely on traditional plastic SIM cards? According to Kaleido Intelligence's market analysis, while eSIM-connected devices are proliferating in the IoT and enterprise markets, their adoption in the consumer market still lags significantly behind expectations. The answers share a common factor: Most friction comes not from the technology itself but from how humans implement it.\n\nTraditional carriers have little incentive to speed up eSIM adoption, because eSIM undermines their core customer retention mechanisms. Users can switch carriers in minutes, removing a key friction point that previously acted as a \"soft lock-in.\" As a result, most major carriers either delay the rollout of eSIM, restrict its use to secondary devices or bury it deep in technical menus.\n\nAs Mobilise Global notes, many MNOs fear an increase in churn and a decline in revenue per user due to easier switching. Until telcos see eSIM not as a threat but as an opportunity to build better, more dynamic customer relationships, progress will remain slow.\n\nAccording to a consumer survey by eSIMcard.com, a niche eSIM resource site, fewer than 40% of consumers feel confident activating an eSIM on their own. Many cite confusing instructions, unclear compatibility and inconsistent onboarding flows as reasons for abandonment.\n\nIn practice, users often encounter QR codes that expire, vague instructions or apps that don't support their device. In an age of one-click everything, eSIM activation still feels like configuring a home router circa 2008. This disconnect is hindering adoption and trust.\n\nWhile most flagship smartphones now support eSIM, mid-tier and entry-level markets remain underserved. In many regions, such as Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, this lack of device support is a significant blocker to adoption.\n\nThis device gap significantly limits mass adoption, especially in prepaid markets where users upgrade slowly. And even within supported devices, not all carriers allow eSIM provisioning. The result: a fragmented ecosystem where capability does not translate into usability. Fragmentation, combined with inconsistent regulation across regions, creates a trust barrier that slows mass-market adoption.\n\neSIM promised a new era of mobile freedom, but most consumers still don\u2019t know it exists.\n\nTelcos and OEMs have largely failed to educate the public. Aside from Apple\u2019s bold move to remove SIM trays in U.S. iPhones, there has been no widespread campaign to explain eSIM\u2019s value. Digital-first players like Holafly, Airalo and Ubigi are filling the gap, especially for travelers, but their outreach remains niche compared to what\u2019s needed for mass adoption.\n\nWhat Needs To Change\n\nIf we want eSIM to reach its potential, three shifts must happen. First, carriers must reframe eSIM as an opportunity. Instead of viewing eSIM as a churn risk, telcos should embrace it as a platform for loyalty through enhanced service, dynamic plans and seamless user experience.\n\nThe user experience also needs radical simplification. QR codes and manual provisioning must go. eSIM onboarding should be as easy as logging into Netflix. Startups building eSIM activation layers with clean APIs and no-code integrations will lead the way.\n\nFinally, consumers need to be educated about the technology. People don't adopt what they don't understand. eSIM needs storytelling, community onboarding and product-led demos that reduce fear and increase trust.\n\nThe eSIM revolution was never about the chip. It was about the choice: the ability to switch networks with ease, travel without roaming fees and stop being locked in. But technology alone doesn\u2019t drive change. If we want eSIM to become the global norm, we must encourage user-first design, transparent pricing and clear, consistent education. Until then, eSIM will remain a hidden feature in an over-marketed phone.\n\nThe technology is ready, and the infrastructure is improving. The next chapter of mobile connectivity will be written by those who prioritize simplicity, transparency and trust. Whether eSIM becomes the norm depends on how boldly we tell its story, and how relentlessly we fight for user-first simplicity.\n\nis an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.",

      "text": "Emma Sky\n06 Jan 2025\neSIM is undoubtedly the most promising solution, and it is hard to ignore. Despite its affordability and flexibility, it eliminates the need for physical plastic SIM cards and frees us from swapping them repeatedly. Having so much to offer with futuristic appeal, why is eSIM not popular in the world?\nIn this blog, we will examine the challenges to eSIM's global adoption and find out why eSIM is not popular.\n4.9\nHighly Rated\nBased on 500,000+ customer reviews\nTrusted worldwide\nOver 1 million travelers across the globe have trusted us\nTravel Friendly\nNo swaps, global connectivity ensured\nMany users think that buying and activating an eSIM is extremely technical. They think that traditional SIMs are more convenient. They just need to be inserted into the phone, unlike eSIMs, which are activated digitally using methods like QR codes or some software settings.\nThe wrong understanding of the activation process develops complexity among users, who think that they are less tech-savvy. For example, a research report by GSMA stated that less than 40% of smartphone users are familiar with eSIM activation.\nMoreover, to find a solution for this, manufacturers or providers could set an approach of step-by-step guiding tutorials or in-store assistance. This activity will set aside the wrong understanding of users about activation of eSIM, converting more physical SIM card users.\nMany countries have yet to adopt eSIM technology. The USA, Germany, and Japan have embraced eSIM entirely, while others lag. The reason behind uneven adoption is regional limitations in telecom infrastructure.\nFor example, countries like Africa and Southeast Asia still prioritize traditional SIM connectivity over eSIM as a secondary option. This ignorance disturbs users' trust in eSIMs for international travel, causing them to experience connectivity issues and lose interest in using them.\nOne major barrier to eSIM adoption is device compatibility. Only expensive high-end devices, such as flagship phones or premium wearables, can support eSIM. Users on a budget face a lack of options and don\u2019t use eSIM for international travel.\nHowever, there is a prediction made by market experts that it all depends on production costs. Soon, the production cost will decrease, and mid-range devices will be supporting eSIM.\nWhy is eSIM not popular? Another reason prevails, and that is control. The user thinks that traditional SIMs are in their control, and they can swap them easily whenever they want or their device malfunctions. On the other hand, while using eSIM, they are worried about control and:\nHowever, eSIM profiles are encrypted, and it\u2019s very difficult to hack them. Switching requires some further steps, but you won't lose any data.\nAdopting eSIM is not just a problem for users, it's also a challenge for the carriers or providers. For eSIM operations, the required infrastructure is very costly because of the resources, training, and technical support. eSIM carrier providers hesitate to provide services for eSIM due to:\nIn the USA, giant carrier providers T-Mobile and AT&T offer competitive plans for users worldwide. However, costly plans reduce the adoption rate of eSIMs.\nAlthough eSIMs are a game changer for travelers and digital nomads, most people are unaware of the technology. The reason behind this is the lack of marketing and educational campaigns for people who do not know the benefits and functionality of eSIMs.\nMost people think that eSIM is a costly and unnecessary luxury. The reality is the opposite; eSIM is for international, affordable roaming and dual-SIM setups.\nThe solution to this unawareness is that carriers and manufacturers should initiate campaigns for eSIM publicity. These campaigns should contain targets like telling the benefits of eSIM and coverage capabilities.\nThose who are looking to switch or adopt eSIM for their daily or international exposure need to know the benefits. The following picture shows you the featured benefits of eSIM and physical SIM:\neSIM offers sustainability and convenience, but users are forced to use physical eSIM cards because they do not understand or are not educated yet about the technology.\nWhy is eSIM not popular? After reading every possible reason, you know the answer. These adoption barriers make it challenging for eSIM to reach its full potential. eSIM is undoubtedly a promising technology, but without proper educational and marketing campaigns, it remains an underutilized technology.\nBut if you are interested in learning more or buying an eSIM for your next trip, try the eSIM Card. They offer tailored packages within budget and provide coverage in more than 200 countries.\nFAQs\neSIM is designed to work globally, almost everywhere, where a cellular network carrier is operational. Whether you are in a tourist country or at a remote location where there is no one except you. If there is a tower in the range, you will stay connected without any hassle.\nYes, you can use both SIMs, but that requires device compatibility for eSIM support, and it should be a dual SIM phone. Most flagship phones of Samsung or Apple are compatible with both SIM usage.\n4.9\nHighly Rated\nBased on 500,000+ customer reviews\nTrusted worldwide\nOver 1 million travelers across the globe have trusted us\nTravel Friendly\nNo swaps, global connectivity ensured\nWith eSIM Card, you can save 100% on roaming fees"

      "text": "Connectivity is a necessity. And eSIM technology has emerged as a promising solution to both consumers and service providers, offering the potential to revolutionise how we stay connected. So why is eSIM not popular?\nDespite its numerous advantages, from seamless switching between networks to enhanced security features, eSIM adoption has been slower than anticipated. In this blog, we\u2019ll cover the reasons behind the slow uptake of eSIM and explore the challenges and opportunities it presents.\nTL;DR\n- eSIM faces many hurdles to popularity, including:\n- Resistance from traditional players\n- Lack of consumer awareness\n- Regulatory hurdles\n- Cost considerations\n- Complex implementation\n- Security and privacy concerns\n- Efforts between stakeholders and innovative solutions can pave the way for wider eSIM adoption.\nResistance from Traditional Players\nThe telecoms industry has been slow to embrace eSIM. And it could stem from multiple perceived threats against their core businesses.\nThe main reason why traditional players are resistant to adopting consumer eSIM technology is because they see it as a threat to their current business models. Telecom operators are particularly concerned about reduced SIM card sales and the possibility of losing long-term subscriber contracts, which could significantly affect their revenue streams and profitability. These operators have invested significant resources in infrastructure and marketing strategies based on the traditional SIM card model, making it difficult for them to fully embrace a technology that fundamentally alters the dynamics of customer engagement and retention dynamics.\neSIM has the potential to give consumers more flexibility and control over their connectivity options, which poses a direct challenge to the traditional strategy of locking customers into long-term contracts. Operators are worried about losing the ability to control subscriber churn and may struggle to adapt their pricing and service offerings to compete in a more dynamic and fluid market.\nDevice manufacturers are also hesitant to adopt eSIM technology due to concerns about its potential impact on their business models. Integrating eSIM technology into devices requires significant research, development, and testing investment, with no guarantee of widespread adoption or acceptance from consumers. Manufacturers must weigh the potential benefits of eSIM, like reduced device complexity and enhanced user experience, against the risks of alienating telecom partners and disrupting existing supply chain dynamics. Ultimately, the fear of the eSIM experience is driving traditional players away from adopting eSIM.\nOpportunities for collaboration and partnerships\nDespite initial resistance, there are significant opportunities for collaboration and partnership between traditional players and eSIM providers. By working together, telecom operators, device manufacturers, and eSIM providers can leverage their strengths to drive market adoption and innovation.\nPartnering with eSIM providers also offers telecom operators the chance to differentiate their services, attract new customers, and tap into emerging revenue streams, such as IoT connectivity and enterprise solutions. By embracing eSIM, operators can position themselves as innovators in the evolving telecommunications landscape and gain a competitive edge in the market.\nDevice manufacturers can also team up with eSIM providers to enhance the value proposition of their products and differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace. By integrating eSIM functionality into their devices, manufacturers can offer consumers greater choice, flexibility, and convenience while reducing the complexity and cost of device management.\nMoreover, collaboration between traditional players and eSIM providers can drive digital identity, authentication, and security innovation. By combining their expertise and resources, stakeholders can develop new use cases and applications for eSIM, unlocking new opportunities for revenue generation and market expansion.\nLack of Consumer Awareness\nThe lack of eSIM awareness and its benefits poses a significant barrier to adoption. Educating consumers about eSIM functionality, such as remote provisioning and network flexibility, is crucial. Telecom SaaS providers can play a vital role in raising awareness through targeted marketing campaigns and educational initiatives.\nThere are a few reasons why consumer awareness of eSIM is so low despite its long existence. However, the main issue lies on the OEMs\u2019 and SPs\u2019 sides.\nAs shown in the image below from a GSMA Intelligence report, only 15% of consumers were aware of eSIM from an OEM, and only 8% received information from their mobile phone operator.\nSource: GSMA Intelligence\nAccording to a GSMA Intelligence report, eSIM awareness among consumers was around 20% in 2020. More recent data suggests that 2023 awareness was still lower than 30%. The level varies across different regions, generations, and smartphone brands owned by consumers. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the awareness is low and growing slowly.\nSo, are consumers unwilling to try new technology? It\u2019s quite the opposite of what the eSIM statistics suggest.\nAccording to a recent eSIM Consumer Pulse 2022 report, 81% of 2,500 surveyed customers across the US, UK, and Australia were in favour of or open to eSIM-only smartphones. Additionally, only 15% of consumers don\u2019t want their provider to sell eSIMs, compared to 58% who do.\nThis perfectly highlights the gap in efforts to improve the uptake for the eSIM future.\nRegulatory Hurdles\nIt\u2019s not just traditional players and consumers that affect eSIM adoption. There are plenty of eSIM challenges that also affect adoption.\nAnd one of them is regulatory challenges. Inconsistent standards and certification processes across different regions create obstacles to eSIM deployment. It is crucial to establish clear and consistent regulatory frameworks to ensure interoperability.\nThe GSMA has developed a compliance framework for eSIM-capable devices, eUICCs, and Subscription Management servers, as shown in the image below. These requirements prioritise eSIM security assurance, functionality, and interoperability. Such frameworks will promote compatibility, making it easier for users to switch between different mobile network operators and devices without hassle.\nWhile this is a robust compliance framework for new players in the eSIM game, it may seem daunting about where to even start ensuring that their service can be compliant.\nTelecom SaaS providers are crucial in promoting eSIM adoption by influencing policymakers and advocating regulatory reforms. By engaging with policymakers, they can highlight the benefits of eSIM technology and the need for supportive regulatory frameworks. Through advocacy efforts, they can create awareness and promote the adoption of eSIM technology, which will enable users to experience the technology\u2019s benefits, such as flexibility, cost savings, and improved user experience.\nCost Considerations\nThe initial investment and ongoing costs associated with implementing eSIM technology present a business adoption barrier. However, potential long-term cost savings through reduced SIM card distribution and management expenses are significant.\nBusinesses encounter initial investment and ongoing costs when implementing eSIM technology. However, potential long-term cost savings through reduced SIM card distribution and management expenses make eSIM adoption enticing.\nComplexity in Implementation\nTechnical challenges, such as system integration and compatibility issues, complicate the implementation of eSIM technology. Managing eSIM profiles and provisioning across different devices and platforms adds to this complexity. eSIM vendors offer solutions to simplify implementation processes, including APIs and cloud-based solutions.\nSecurity and Privacy Concerns\nThere are often security and privacy concerns surrounding eSIM, including the risks of hacking and data breaches, which deter adoption.\nLike any technology, eSIMs also have certain risks and vulnerabilities. Some of the potential risks include the possibility of malicious actors intercepting and manipulating eSIM communications, exploiting vulnerabilities in eSIM software or hardware and gaining unauthorised access to sensitive user data stored on the eSIM chip. Additionally, eSIMs can be subject to social engineering attacks or other forms of user error, such as inadvertently exposing login credentials or failing to update software regularly.\nHowever, eSIM offers several advantages over physical SIM security, such as better protection against physical theft or loss, as well as the ability to remotely manage and update eSIM profiles.\neSIM providers must implement encryption and secure provisioning protocols to address these concerns. Providers are advised to adhere to data protection regulations when deploying eSIM technology.\nRECOMMENDED READING\nOur solution \u2013 eSIM as a Service\nWe have the perfect solution, making implementing eSIM as part of your service offering easier than ever.\nLarger service providers already possess the necessary resources, technology, relationships, and negotiating power to address consumer eSIM challenges effectively.\nOur eSIM as a Service solution empowers Service Providers to create fully digital customer journeys and future-proof their brands. Leveraging our HERO platform\u2019s capabilities and our telecom industry expertise, we enable SPs to swiftly and efficiently launch a successful consumer eSIM offering without the need for complex integrations.\nConclusion\neSIM could change the way we connect. So why is eSIM not popular? It seems there are still a few hurdles to overcome before becoming the standard, including regulation, a lack of support from traditional players in the telco industry and a lack of consumer awareness.\nTo overcome these challenges, businesses and industry leaders need to work together. By addressing these key challenges and leveraging the opportunities presented, and with the right efforts, eSIM could revolutionise the future of connectivity and become the standard connectivity method."

First, eSIMs are embedded directly into devices, making it difficult for unauthorized users to remove or tamper with them. Second, eSIMs utilize secure elements to store sensitive data, such as your mobile identity, which helps prevent hacking. Additionally, eSIM activation requires scanning a QR code or using a specific activation code, adding another layer of security. Overall, eSIM technology provides a robust and reliable way to ensure the security of your mobile communications.\nCan I tether / use Personal Hotspot?\nYou can easily use your Yesim profile to share mobile data with other devices. All you need to do is install the Yesim profile on your device and turn on Personal Hotspot in the settings. This feature is enabled by default on your account, and there are no additional fees for using it, though any data used while tethered will be deducted from your plan.\nCan I keep my personal WhatsApp / Snapchat / Telegram number while using Yesim's eSIM?\nYes.

You pay only for the traffic you have used according to the eSIM data plan you bought.\nWhat is the fair usage policy for eSIM unlimited data plans?\nTo meet the high demands of our users, we at Yesim have developed unlimited plans to meet their needs. However, due to the Fair Usage Policy (FUP), after reaching a certain amount of provided data some speed reduction might be applied.\nAfter using the allocated amount of high-speed wireless data, users still have access to unlimited data. Fair Usage Policy allows users to use the internet for web browsing and emailing, providing uninterrupted access to online services at a lower speed.\nWhy is my mobile internet data speed sometimes lower than usual?\nThe speed of mobile data can be affected by many factors, such as the type of smartphone you are using, the available network technology, the websites or applications you are accessing, the time of day, network congestion, other factors in the transmission path, and the cell tower's or area's data usage. Additionally, the download and upload speeds depend on the country's network infrastructure and boradband connection type. Low internet speed is usually caused by a mobile operator's poor coverage and can be remedied by rebooting your phone and sending us screenshots of the internet speed with and without LTE mode enabled.\nWhat makes Yesim different from other eSIM services?\nYesim distinguishes itself from other eSIM providers by forming partnerships with local operators globally in 200+ destinations, offering cost-effective data packs without middlemen, robust coverage, virtual phone numbers, incorporating VPN technology for security, and providing easy activation processes.

  "argos_summary": "eSIM promises seamless, digital onboarding and reduced waste, yet adoption lags because carriers fear churn, consumers lack clear instructions, and device support is limited mainly to high\u2011end phones, especially in emerging markets. Fragmentation across carriers, inconsistent regulation, and a fragmented ecosystem create trust barriers, while marketing and education are minimal. To accelerate uptake, telcos must reframe eSIM as a loyalty tool, simplify activation beyond QR codes, and launch consumer\u2011focused campaigns that highlight its benefits. The technology is ready, but widespread use will depend on user\u2011first design, transparent pricing, and coordinated industry effort.",
