  "title": "PCIe 8's ludicrously fast speeds break the terabyte barrier",
  "description": "PCI Express 8 will increase the available PCIe bandwidth to a terabyte's worth of data across a x16 connection, the PCI Special Interest Group, or about seven times what it is today.",
  "content": "As expected, by 2028 your PC will be internally passing a terabyte\u2019s worth of data per second as part of PCI Express 8.0.\n\nThe PCI Special Interest Group said Tuesday that the PCIe 8 specification is due to be released in 2028, with speeds of 256 gigatransfers per second. In real-world terms, that works out to 1 terabyte per second being passed over a x16 connection via the PCI Express 8.0 bus.\n\nThe new data rate should come as no surprise, as the SIG has consistently released iterative PCI Express standards that double the available bandwidth about every three years. In June, the PCIe SIG formally announced the PCI Express 7 specification, projected to be released in 2027. At that time, the SIG disclosed the existence of PCIe 8 without the bandwidth data, but the projection was easy enough to make.\n\nThe timing of it all can be a bit confusing. Practically, the fastest PCI Express devices currently available for the PC, such as the fastest PC SSDs, use the PCI Express 5 protocol \u2014 128GB/s at x16 speeds. Last week, the first PCI Express 6.0 SSD shipped: the Micron 9650, which can hypothetically process 256GB/s at a time. (They can\u2019t, in reality. The drive reads of up to 28,000 MB/s \u2014 which is roughly 13 percent under the peak PCIe 6.0 bandwidth, with sequential writes of 14,000 MB/s.)\n\nThe graphic below shows the progression of PCI Express speeds, but also hints as the hypothetical limits of certain components, too. SSDs typically use a x4 interface, so they\u2019ll have a maximum hypothetical data rate of 256GB/s under PCI Express 8, versus the 32GB/s they operate under with the current PCI Express 5. Graphics cards, conversely, use a x16 connection, meaning that PCIe 8 will supply about seven times more bandwidth than it does today.\n\nThe Micron 9650, however, is aimed at data centers, not the PC. Micron\u2019s release of the 9650 coincides with our report that the PCI Express 6.0 integrator\u2019s list of actual PCIe 6 hardware will be released this year, though data centers and AI may gobble up all of the available hardware. Silicon Motion\u2019s CEO told Tom\u2019s Hardware that the company doesn\u2019t expect PCI Express 6.0 to appear in PCs for a few years.\n\nThat\u2019s what the PCIe SIG is saying for the first PCIe 8.0 devices, too: they\u2019ll be used for artificial intelligence and machine learning first and foremost, then high-speed networking and quantum computing.\n\n\u201cAs artificial intelligence and other data-intensive applications continue to scale rapidly, PCIe technology demand will be sustained in the long run due to its high bandwidth, scalability and power efficiency,\u201d said Reece Hayden, principal analyst at ABI Research, as quoted by the PCI-SIG. \u201cData center networks are already preparing to implement PCIe 6.0 technology and are showing great interest in the PCIe 7.0 specification. The introduction of the PCIe 8.0 specification further ensures that the industry\u2019s bandwidth requirements will be supported well into the future.\u201d\n\nA terabyte\u2019s worth of bandwidth, though, is no joke, and neither are the thermal issues that come with it. The two key problems that need to be addressed are when AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm plan to add PCI Express 6 to their PC roadmaps \u2014 let alone 7 or 8 \u2014 and how device makers will deal with the corresponding increase in heat that the increased bandwidth will bring with it.",

      "text": "Over the past few years, high-end PCs have come to be associated with PCI Express 5.0, the infrastructure that connects graphics cards and SSDs. That\u2019s close to changing, as the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG) hits a key milestone this year to bring the higher-bandwidth PCI Express 6 to PCs.\nMost of the news today from the PCI SIG is theoretical: the SIG has formally announced PCIe 7.0, projected for 2027, and it\u2019s laying the groundwork for PCIe 8.0. Meanwhile, PCI-SIG is even allowing PCI Express to work over optical connections.\nThat will all make a difference, eventually. But the most meaningful announcement might be the eventual announcement of the PCIe 6.0 integrator\u2019s list, projected to be released in 2025. (Editor\u2019s Note: Toms\u2019s Hardware quoted one executive who believes that PCI Express 6.0 hardware won\u2019t arrive for PCs until perhaps 2030.)\nLike other industry consortiums, the PCI-SIG works on developing the PCI Express specification with industry partners. The SIG develops its own requirements and then tests each product for compliance. Finally, it publishes its integrators\u2019 list of actual products that have been tested against the specification. Near the top of the current list are AMD\u2019s own 7th-gen Ryzen processors, which followed AMD\u2019s 12th-gen \u201cAlder Lake\u201d chips into the market as the first PC processors with PCI Express 5.0 connections, in 2022.\nPCI-SIG\nCould the PC shift to PCIe 6 in 2025?\nWhat some forget about the PCI Express SIG is that it moves slowly and on parallel timelines. The final 1.0 specification of PCIe 6 was actually announced in 2022, and the SIG has actually moved on to PCI Express 6.3\u2014even though we haven\u2019t seen a single PCIe 6 product yet. That still signals that the industry has moved past the specification phase and into product development and testing.\nToday, the PCI SIG is saying that the first integrator\u2019s list associated with PCI Express 6 is projected for 2025. That implies that the first PCI Express 6.0 processors, chipsets, SSDs, and graphics cards could debut near the end of the year, about the time when Intel\u2019s next-gen Panther Lake chip is expected.\nWe know, on paper, what PCIe 6 can do: 64 gigatransfers per second, which equates to 64GB/s on the x4 connections that SSDs use and 256GB/s on an x16 connection of a dedicated graphics card. PCIe 7 will offer 512GB/s of bidirectional I/O bandwidth, double the 256GB/s of PCI Express 6 and four times that of the current PCI Express 5, which offers 128GB/s, all across a x16 connection.\nWe don\u2019t know what this will mean in the real world\u2014not only in throughput, but especially for heat. PCIe 5 SSDs already ship with optional heat sinks, and companies like Frore and, most recently, xMEMS have suggested active cooling solutions for SSDs, too. But last year, an Intel PCI Express driver surfaced, suggesting that the PC could thermally throttle a PCIe 6 link to avoid overheating. The SIG hasn\u2019t addressed this, and it remains a potential speed bump in PCIe\u2019s development.\nThe SIG hasn\u2019t said anything about PCIe 8, but with bandwidth essentially doubling since the 8 gigatransfers/s of PCI 3.0, we can guess that the target will be 256GT/s, or the first terabyte connection (1.024TB/s) in PCI Express history. You\u2019ll just have to wait a while\u2014probably until 2028 for the specification itself, then two to three years later for actual products."

      "text": "SSDs, or solid state drives, have drastically improved the computing experience over the last decade or so. Thanks to them, once ponderous boot times now border on instantaneous, programs and games are far more responsive, and the frustratingly long waits to load large files are largely a thing of a past.\nSo\u2026 if you\u2019re not yet using an SSD, what are you waiting for? If you already have an older SSD, you might consider upgrading it for the even headier performance offered by cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 designs. If your PC sports those technologies, of course.\nThat said, a premium drive may not deliver any more real-world performance than a bargain drive. Mainstream software, including Windows has yet to implement the numerous performance tricks, such as multiple queues, that NVMe SSDs offer.\nPROMOTION\nClone & Migrate SSDs | EaseUS Disk Copy\nReady to upgrade to SSDs? EaseUS Disk Copy helps you make it in one click.

It did well in our testing and is available for just $45 in the 500GB capacity and $68 at 1TB.\nCrucial P3: Further considerations\nIt\u2019s only PCIe 3.0 (3Gbps), but many users are still on that older spec and won\u2019t benefit much from the faster, but generally pricier PCIe 4.0/5.0 SSDs. The P3\u2019s TBW (terabytes that may be written) rating is also quite low at 220 per terabyte of capacity (the unfortunate norm for QLC NAND), but we\u2019ll forgive that in light of the price.\nThough the P3 is cheap, prices have dropped on faster PCIe 4.0 models (5.0 still carries a premium) since this review, so newer technology might make sense in terms of future-proofing for you next machine. Regardless, all NVMe SSDs are subjectively lightning-fast, so the P3 can save you money without any sacrifice in satisfaction.\nRead our full Crucial P3 review\nWD Black SN7100 SSD \u2013 Best PCIe 4.0 SSD\nPros\n- Top-notch HMB performance\n- Affordable\n- Sexy name\nCons\n- Slower random performance than DRAM designs\nWho should buy the WD Black SN7100?\nUsers who want the fastest 1TB to 4TB PCIe 4.0 SSD that won\u2019t break the bank will want the WD Black SN7100. We were wowed by the 2TB version\u2019s first-place finish among host memory buffer (HMB/DRAM-less) SSDs in our benchmarks. It also beat out a number of DRAM designs.\nWD Black SN7100: Further considerations\nThe fact that it\u2019s an HMB design, i.e. it uses your system\u2019s memory for primary caching duties as opposed to featuring DRAM onboard, means the SN7100 is very competitively priced. We\u2019re talking close to $50 less than our previous pick, the Solidigm P44 Pro, for both the 1TB and 2TB capacities.\nCombine that with an industry-standard five-year warranty / 600TBW rating (terabytes that can be written) per TB, and you\u2019re looking at the best PCIe 4.0 SSD for average users and gamers.\nRead our full WD Black SN7100 NVMe SSD review\nWD Blue SN5000 \u2013 Best budget PCIe 4.0 SSD\nPros\n- Good everyday performance\n- Very affordable\n- Fastest NVMe SSD writing 450GB\nCons\n- Top performance requires HMB support\nWho should buy the WD Blue SN5000?\nGamers and non-gamers alike who are on a strict budget will save money without sacrificing top-flight performance with this PCIe 4.0 HMB (Host Memory Buffer/DRAM-less) SSD. At just $65 for a 1TB model at the time of writing, the Blue SN5000 is almost a steal.\nWD Blue SN5000: Further considerations\nIn our testing, the SN5000 ranked among the fastest Host Memory Buffer (HMB) SSDs we\u2019ve tested. And unlike the SN580 before it, the SN5000 didn\u2019t falter during the 450GB transfer test, placing fourth among all SSDs. Yes, you lose nothing in sequential performance these days with HMB.\nRead our full WD Blue SN5000 NVMe SSD review\nTeamgroup Z540 \u2013 Best PCIe 5.0 SSD\nPros\n- PCIe 5.0\n- Up to 4TB in capacity (soon)\n- Second-fastest SSD we\u2019ve tested overall\nCons\n- Not particularly cheap\nWho should buy the Teamgroup Z540?\nUsers looking for every last ounce of performance should be looking at this PCIe 5.0 SSD from Teamgroup. In all fairness, the Z540 traded benchmark wins and finished a hair behind our previous top pick the Crucial T705. But the Teamgroup Z540 beats that competitor when it comes to price, making it the new top pick for this category.\nTeamgroup Z540: Further considerations\nAs with any PCIe 5.0 SSD, there are important caveats. For starters, you\u2019re paying a hefty premium over extremely fast, and in some ways faster (real-world sequential performance) Host Memory Buffer NVMe PCIe 4.0 drives.\nOnly if you use multi-threaded software and your system sports a late-gen Intel CPU (which the Phison PS5026-E26-52 controller inside this drive is optimized for), can you be assured of benchmarking-busting performance.\nRead our full Teamgroup Z540 PCIe 5 SSD review\nPNY CS2150 PCIe 5.0 SSD \u2013 Best budget PCIe 5.0 SSD\nPros\n- Fast PCIe 5.0 HMB performer\n- Affordable for the speed\n- Maintains decent write rate after secondary cache is exhausted\nCons\n- Not as fast as PCIe 5.0 DRAM designs\nWho should buy the PNY CS2150?\nAnyone who enjoys more for less will like this drive \u2014 serious coin can be saved on a PCIe 5.0 SSD by opting for a Host Memory Buffer (HNB) design such as PNY\u2019s CS2150. Using the host system\u2019s memory as the SSD\u2019s primary cache instead of dedicated DRAM on the drive means significantly lower manufacturing costs.\nPNY CS2150: Further considerations\nHMB doesn\u2019t stop the CS2150 from competing with more expensive SSDs. Indeed, the 2TB version that we tested placed 9th overall among all types of NVMe SSDs and it ran neck-in-neck with the Corsair MP700 \u2014 another HMB SSD whose performance impressed us.\nPNY\u2019s CS2150 trumps its Corsair peer by costing from $10 to $40 less than the latter in the 1TB and 2TB versions, respectively. You still get the industry standard standard five-year warranty and 600TBW (terabytes that can be written) guarantee.\nIf you have the PCIe 5.0 M.2 slot to support it, this SSD is an affordable way to performance future-proof your storage.\nRead our full PNY CS2150 PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSD review\nCrucial P310 (2230) \u2013 Best SSD for Steam Deck\nPros\n- Fastest 2230 SSD we\u2019ve tested\n- Available at up to 2TB\nCons\n- Low TBW endurance rating\nWho should buy the Crucial P310?\nAnyone looking to upgrade the capacity or speed of their Steam Deck storage should seriously consider the P310 \u2014 it\u2019s the fastest (by a rather large margin) 2230 short-form-factor SSD that we\u2019ve tested.\nFor a Steam Deck and many other small devices, you can\u2019t use a commonplace 2280 (22mm wide, 80mm long) PCIe NVMe SSD \u2014 you need a 2230 type, meaning one that measures 22mm wide, by only 30mm long. Some will also accept the slightly larger 2242 SSDs.\nCrucial P310: Further considerations\nThere are a few very close competitors, such as the the WD Black SN770M, the Corsair MP600 Core Mini \u2014 but the P310 is our top choice because, as previously mentioned, it proved the fastest 2230 type we\u2019ve tested in every benchmark save for the 450GB write. It\u2019s a little pricier than the SN770M, but by a mere $10 at both the 1TB and 2TB capacities at the time of this writing.\nIf optimum speed is what you\u2019re after, and you don\u2019t foresee regularly writing huge 450GB files, the P310 is the ticket.\nRead our full Crucial P310 NVMe SSD (2230) review\nSeagate Game Drive SSD \u2013 Best SSD for PS5\nPros\n- Very good overall performance\n- Excellent random 4K performance\n- Low-profile heatsink\n- Twice the TBW rating of the competition\nCons\n- On the pricey side\n- Maxes out at 2TB\nWho should buy the Seagate Game Drive SSD?\nThose who want a great-performing SSD that will outlast the useful life of a PS5, should seriously consider the Seagate Game Drive SSD. It\u2019s a PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD with a superb TBW rating that\u2019s fully endowed with DRAM for primary caching duties. DRAM maximizes small-file performance in Sony\u2019s console system, which doesn\u2019t support the Host Memory Buffer technology (using system memory for primary caching) that many bargain SSDs employ.\nSeagate Game Drive SSD: Further considerations\nAs to outlasting the console, Seagate provides a generous five-year warranty with the drive and spectacularly \u2014 a double-the-industry-norm 1,275TBW rating. TBW (terabytes that may be written) is the mitigating factor in SSD warranties, like the miles in an auto warranty. Exceed them and the SSD may become read-only.\nThe 1TB and 2TB Game Drive SSDs are a bit pricey, but the extra bucks bring you that TBW peace of mind. Note also, that while Seagate claims the Game Drive is optimized for a PS5, it\u2019s no slouch as a regular SSD either. In our performance tests it was the second-fastest PCIe 4.0 SSD with random (small file) operations that we\u2019ve ever tested.\nRead our full Seagate Game Drive PS5 NVMe SSD review\nSamsung 870 EVO \u2013 Best SATA SSD\nPros\n- Excellent performance with small file operations\n- Long writes don\u2019t slow down\nCons\n- A little expensive\nWho should buy the Samsung 870 EVO?\nUsers who are looking to add some fast storage via an old-school, but still effective 2.5-inch SATA SSD will want Samsung\u2019s spectacular (for SATA) 870 EVO. It\u2019s the fastest SATA SSD we\u2019ve tested, is available with up to 4TB of capacity, and is exceedingly affordable given the speed.\nSamsung 870 EVO: Further considerations\nWhile not as fast as NVMe, 550MBps/fast seeking SATA still blows the doors off of hard drives. The 870 EVO\u2019s price: $100 for 1TB, $170 for 2TB, and $260 for 4TB and speed speak for themselves \u2014 though Samsung\u2019s excellent Magician SSD management software also deserves a shout-out.\nRead our full Samsung 870 EVO SATA SSD review\nCrucial BX500 \u2013 Best budget SATA SSD\nPros\n- Good everyday performance\n- Low price per gigabyte\nCons\n- QLC NAND slows drastically during very long writes\nWho should buy the Crucial BX500?\nThose looking to add uber-affordable storage via SATA, should consider the exceedingly cost-effective Crucial BX500. You can get its 1TB model for $60, almost $40 less than the equivalent Samsung 870 EVO, while a 2TB version costs just $110.\nCrucial BX500: Further considerations\nThe drive also comes in nearly dirt-cheap 240GB and 480GB capacities. But be wary of smaller capacity QLC NAND SSDs if you regularly write large amounts of data, as they can slow drastically during such operations.\nRead our full Crucial BX500 SATA SSD (2TB) review\nCrucial X9 Pro \u2013 Best external SSD\nPros\n- Super small form factor\n- Great 10Gbps performance\n- Handsome design\nCons\n- Not the least expensive 10Gbps SSD available\nWho should buy the Crucial X9 Pro?\nThe Crucial X9 Pro is a sure bet for anyone who wants the fastest 10Gbps performance at a still affordable price. A svelte beauty that delivers 1GBps transfer rates, the X9 Pro is sold in 1TB ($90), 2TB ($130), or 4TB ($237) capacities.\nCrucial X9: Further considerations\nIn our testing, the X9 Pro performed admirably against the 10Gbps competition. Excelling especially in the real-world 48GB transfer tests and the 450GB write test \u2014 where it smoked the other 10Gbps drives we\u2019ve tested.\nCrucial also sells the 20Gbps X10 Pro, but you\u2019ll pay quite a bit more for the doubled speed, and said speed is also dependent upon a USB 3.2\u00d72 port. We think that the X9 Pro will serve the average user perfectly fine with excellent all-around performance at a significantly cheaper price point.\nFor many more external SSD recommendations, see our roundup of the best external drives.\nRead our full Crucial X9 Pro review\nOther notable SSD reviews\nWhile the following SSDs did not make our list of recommendations, some of them came very close: the Lexar NM1090 Pro is a fast PCIe 5.0 SSD, just not quite as fast as its peers; the Crucial T710 a PCIe 5.0 stunner that can come with a beefy heatsink; the Lexar NQ780 is a buy recommendation at the right price; the Orico IG740-Pro compensates for merely okay performance with some cool extras; the PNY CS2342 is an awesome teeny-tiny SSD for Steam Deck; the XPG Mars 980 Blade has great performance in random ops, making it a good choice for running an OS from; the Samsung 9100 Pro is the fastest NVMe SSD you can buy, but it isn\u2019t cheap; the WD SN850X 8TB SSD is the drive you want for fast speeds and large capacities; the Kingston NV3 is good value with top performance at a competitive price; the Adata 970 Pro will appeal to gamers with PCIe 5.0 speed and a fan-cooled heatsink; the PNY CS2150 is a PCIe 5.0 value buy; the Addlink G55H belongs on your PCIe 5.0 short list.\nHow we test SSDs\nAll SSD are tested using a combination of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. To mimic a typical user experience, our real-world tests include 48GB transfers of both a single file and many small files, as well as a 450GB transfer.\nThe performance numbers we refer to apply only to the drive we were shipped, as well as the capacity tested. SSD performance can vary by capacity due to more or fewer chips to read/write across and the amount of NAND available for secondary caching. Vendors also occasionally swap components. If you ever notice a large discrepancy between the performance you experience and that which we report (systems being roughly equal), by all means \u2014 let us know.\nYou can learn more in our articles on how we test internal SSDs and how we test external drives.\nWhy you should trust PCWorld for SSD reviews and buying advice\nIt\u2019s in our name, PCWorld. Our reviewers have been testing PC hardware for decades. Our storage evaluations are thorough and rigorous, testing the limits of every product \u2014 from performance benchmarks to the practicalities of regular use. As PC users ourselves, we know what makes a product stand out. Only the best SSDs make this list.\nWho curated this article?\nHaving started computing by flipping switches, Jon Jacobi has witnessed storage morph from punch cards and tape to solid state. He\u2019s been using and testing HDDs, SATA SSDs, and NVMe SSDs for PCWorld for well over two decades. To paraphrase a well-known commercial, you might say he\u2019s seen a thing or two.\nHow to choose the best SSD\nThere are several factors that you should take into consideration when choosing an SSD.\nShould I buy an NVMe or SATA SSD?\nOnly look for SATA if your computer or device doesn\u2019t support the far, far faster NVMe. Note that an M.2 slot in an older computer might be mSATA rather than NVMe. Read your user guide or manual to see if it\u2019s NVMe-capable/NVMe-bootable. It should be both to take full advantage of NVMe.\nShould I look for a DRAM or HMB SSD?\nSSDs using DRAM for primary caching offer faster random (small file) operations, while those that forego the cost of DRAM use a technique called host memory buffer (HMB). HMB does just what it sounds like, employs your computer (the host) memory for primary caching.\nAfter a rough start, HMB has developed marvelous sequential-transfer performance as fast or faster than DRAM designs, though as just stated above, random operations still lag behind those DRAM designs.\nIf you want the best overall, and especially random performance, then you want a DRAM design. You\u2019ll pay for it though: HMB designs are often half the price.\nWhich PCIe generation should my SSD use?\nAn NVMe SSD won\u2019t perform any faster than the PCIe generation of the CPU/motherboard it\u2019s installed in. Because of that, using a PCIe 5.0 SSD on a PCIe 3.0/4.0 system offers almost no benefit.\nIn truth, as Windows and most Windows software doesn\u2019t support multiple queues \u2014 a major factor in NVMe performance \u2014 you can save a lot of money without sacrificing much real world speed by sticking with PCIe 4.0, even in 5.0 motherboards.\nNVMe performance even on PCIe 3.0 is insanely fast. Basically, don\u2019t overbuy.\nHow much capacity should I opt for in my SSD?\nYou want as much capacity as you can afford. SSDs currently ship in capacities from 250GB to 8TB. More capacity also means more NAND for secondary caching, and less chance you\u2019ll see any slowdowns on long writes.\nWhat type of warranty should I look for with my SSD?\nMost internal SSDs are warrantied for five years, while externals are more likely to be covered for only three years. These numbers don\u2019t vary much, but make sure it\u2019s not less than that. The warranty can be overridden by the next topic: TBW.\nWhat\u2019s a TBW rating?\nThe TBW rating (terabytes that may be written), is the manufacturer\u2019s estimate/rating of how much data may be written to an SSD before it morphs into a read-only device. This is due to cells, which are voltage traps, wearing out after a certain number of writes. Reads don\u2019t wear on a cell like a write.\nAverage TBW rating these days is 600TBW (TLC) per 1TB of capacity. QLC SSDs tend to have much lower TBW ratings, generally 250TBW per TB or less. That\u2019s still a lot of writes.\nWhat should I look for in the way of BIOS support?\nTo get the most out of an NVMe drive, you want to run your operating system off of it, which requires a system that can boot from NVMe. Any modern PC will, but if you\u2019re rocking older, but still viable hardware, read the specs.\nFAQ\nWhat is the best NVMe SSD?\nIf we had to choose any one SSD to fill our system, it would be the WD Black SN7100. This PCIe 4.0 SSD comes in up to 4TB of capacity. The 2TB version that we tested was the fastest overall in our benchmarks. Because the drive uses a host memory buffer design for cache, as opposed to onboard DRAM, it\u2019s competitively priced, making it an excellent price-to-performance value.\nWhat is the best cheap NVMe SSD?\nThe best cheap SSD in our view is the WD Blue SN5000, followed closely by Kingston\u2019s NV3. Both of these PCIe 4.0 SSDs are fast, and very affordable. However, when it comes to PCIe 5.0, the PNY CS2150 is your bargain choice.\nWhat is the best gaming SSD?\nEssentially, gaming consoles are computers so the same SSDs that are best for PCs are the also best for gaming consoles. That said, the excellent performance and super-generous TBW rating of Seagate\u2019s Game Drive PS5 SSD makes it our current choice. The DRAM design (which uses onboard memory for secondary caching) results in class-leading random ops performance, as well a full compatibility with PS5.\nWhat is best SATA SSD?\nOur current favorite SATA SSD is the Samsung 870 EVO. It\u2019s fast and affordable.\nWhat is the best cheap SATA SSD?\nThe current best buy when in comes to bargain SSDs is the Crucial BX500. It\u2019s fast enough, and dirt cheap.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between an SSD and HDD?\nAn SSD, or solid state drive, is a non-mechanical device that uses non-volatile memory (generally NAND) to store data. An HDD, or hard disk drive, is mechanical and stores data on spinning platters as magnetic marks. Read/write heads traverse the platter to seek and transfer data. Because of all the moving parts on an HDD, they have a higher chance of failure over time.\nAre SSDs good for long-term storage?\nSSDs are excellent for long-term storage, though that depends on what you consider long term. Theoretically, the NAND memory cells, which are voltage traps, could leak over time and become unreadable, but in the decade or so that SSDs have been in heavy use, we\u2019ve not seen this type of degradation. Short answer, a couple of decades, yes; a couple of millennia, perhaps not.\nWhat is the best SSD brand for PC?\nIf you want the best guarantees look to Seagate. Samsung and WD are also long-standing favorites with well-earned reputations for quality products.\nThat said,nearly all the second-tier vendors and even some of the top-tier companies use the highly competent industry bigwig Phison for their SSD designs. In other words, there aren\u2019t any real dogs among relatively well-known SSD sellers.\nRelated content\n- Latest SSD reviews\n- Is USB or Thunderbolt better for portable SSDs?
