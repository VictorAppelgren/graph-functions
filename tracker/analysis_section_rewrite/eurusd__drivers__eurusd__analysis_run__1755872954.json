      "feedback": "To elevate your analysis to world-class quality, enhance the depth and clarity of reasoning by explicitly outlining the causal chain between rising inflation, consumer behavior, and S&P 500 performance, ensuring coherence throughout. Strengthen alignment with the SECTION FOCUS by integrating macro, policy, and technical drivers more distinctly, while adhering to length constraints. Ground your arguments in first principles by providing specific scenarios for inflation persistence and Fed responses, detailing potential catalysts and triggers for market movements. Quantify your assertions with precise data points and ranges, avoiding generic statements; for instance, specify how much corporate margins might contract under various inflation scenarios. Increase citation density by referencing all critical sources accurately and reconciling any conflicting information. Finally, refine your watch-list by clearly delineating the timing and significance of each signal, ensuring it directly ties back to your core thesis.",
