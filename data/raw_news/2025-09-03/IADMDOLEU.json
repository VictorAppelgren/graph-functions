  "title": "Could the Super Bowl Be Moved to Presidents Day Weekend? Roger Goodell Weighs In",
  "description": "The NFL commissioner gave his take on whether the Super Bowl could one day fall on the Sunday before Presidents Day.",
  "content": "With millions of fans already wishing the day after the Super Bowl was a national holiday, what if it actually was?\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was asked in an exclusive interview on TODAY on Sept. 3 if it's possible the Super Bowl would ever annually be played the Sunday before Presidents Day, a national holiday observed on the third Monday of February.\n\n\"I think if you went to 18 weeks regular season that would probably occur,\" Goodell told Savannah Guthrie and Craig Melvin. \"It is possible somewhere in the calendar. Could happen before that just because of the calendar, the way it lays out. But I think 18 weeks would get you to that point, and I think it would be a really great move.\"\n\nThe NFL regular season is currently 18 weeks long and features teams playing 17 games with one bye week. The Super Bowl has traditionally fallen on the second weekend of February as a result.\n\nThe next Super Bowl is set for Feb. 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the home of the San Francisco 49ers. Presidents Day is on Feb. 16 in 2026.\n\nGoodell suggested that if the league moved to an 18-game regular season over 19 weeks, it would extend the season a week later. That change would allow the Super Bowl to fall on Presidents Day weekend, ensuring that anyone who had too much fun at a Super Bowl party wouldn't have to fake being sick to bail out of work the next day.\n\n\"I do think it makes sense for a lot of reasons,\" Goodell said.\n\nGoodell said after the owners meeting in May that an 18-game season had not been formally discussed, according to NBC Sports.\n\nThe 2025 season, which kicks off on Sept. 4 on NBC, is the fifth season of the 17-game schedule. From 1978 through 2020, NFL teams played 16 regular-season games. Before 1978, it was a 14-game schedule.\n\nThe NFL and the NFL Players Association would have to come to an agreement for an 18-game season to become reality, so right now it's all just theoretical.\n\nKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, one of the NFL's biggest stars, said in July that he's \"not a big fan\" of an 18-game season because of the increased risk of injury that could cause teams to be without their best players in the playoffs.\n\n\"If there were a way, I think you got to add some bye weeks in there to give more time for guys\u2019 bodies,\" Mahomes told CNBC.\n\nPlayers have also expressed that they would want bigger salaries if another game is added.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not paying us enough money already,\u201d Pittsburgh Steelers safety DeShon Elliott told ESPN in 2024. \u201cThey\u2019re stingy with their money, so they want to make us play 18 games, as a player union, we should get way more money than what we\u2019re getting \u2014 and not just the top guys. And the thing is, they\u2019re not out here playing football. They\u2019re not here running around putting their bodies on the line. They don\u2019t care. All they care about is making money, but if you\u2019re going to make money on the top end, the bottom end has to make money, too.\u201d\n\nIn his interview on TODAY, Goodell also weighed in on various other topics, including whether Travis Kelce's fianc\u00e9e, pop star Taylor Swift, will perform at the Super Bowl in 2026.",

      "text": "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is the face of the NFL. He\u2019s not the face of the NFL\u2019s push for an inevitable 18th regular-season game.\nIn an interview with CNBC Sport, Mahomes addressed the topic of another game that counts.\n\u201cI think that you\u2019d have to find a way to have more bye weeks, more time spread out,\u201d Mahomes told Alex Sherman of CNBC. \u201cBecause, I mean, you\u2019ve seen the amount of injuries that have kind of piled up there at the end of seasons, and you want to have the best players playing in the biggest games. And so if there were a way to get to 18 games, I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not a big fan of it. But if there were a way, I think you got to add some bye weeks in there to give more time for guys\u2019 bodies.\u201d\nBengals quarterback Joe Burrow previously has argued that, if there\u2019s another regular-season game, there should be a second bye.\nA second bye makes a ton of sense. Yes, the network hated the two-bye season of 1993, because it diluted the number of week-in and week-out games. But there are six more franchises now than there were then.\nThe other problem is scheduling. The league justifies an 18th game in part by pointing to the reality of a Super Bowl on President\u2019s Day Weekend. Adding an extra bye will result in the Super Bowl overshooting President\u2019s Day \u2014 unless the NFL is willing to revert to the days of Week 1 on Labor Day Weekend. (And maybe it should.)\nHowever it plays out, an 18th game is coming. The only question left is whether the NFL Players Association agrees to it before the 2030 season, or whether the NFL has to lock them out until they inevitably take the best deal on the table before missing game checks in 2031."

      "text": "Will Taylor Swift perform during the halftime show of the next Super Bowl?\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell wouldn\u2019t say as much, but he certainly didn\u2019t rule out the possibility when asked about it Sept. 3 on TODAY.\n\u201cWe would always love to have Taylor play. She is a special, special talent, and obviously she would be welcome at any time,\u201d Goodell said.\n\u201cIs it in the works?\u201d Savannah Guthrie asked.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything about it,\u201d Goodell replied.\n\u201cIs it a maybe?\u201d followed up Savannah.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maybe,\u201d he said.\nCraig Melvin then asked when people could expect to hear an announcement.\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting on my friend Jay-Z,\u201d Goodell joked in response. \u201cIt\u2019s in his hands. I\u2019m waiting for the smoke to come out.\u201d (Jay-Z and his company, Roc Nation, produce the Super Bowl halftime shows.)\nSwift, of course, has become a presence at Kansas City Chiefs games the last few seasons while dating Travis Kelce. The pair got engaged last month.\nSuper Bowl 60 will take place Feb. 8 at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The NFL season kicks off Sept. 4 when the defending Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, host the Dallas Cowboys at 8:20 p.m. on NBC.\nGoodell also addressed the potential for the Super Bowl to be moved to a different date. While the game has been played in February for several years, there has been chatter around the idea of making the day after it a holiday so people don\u2019t have to go into work after staying up late. That has some fans pushing for the game to be played over Presidents Day weekend.\nAccording to Goodell, the Super Bowl could be played that weekend if the league expands its schedule to include 18 regular season games.\n\u201cI think if you went to 18 weeks regular season, that would probably occur,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible somewhere in the calendar, could happen before that, just because of the calendar it lays out. But I think 18 weeks would get you to that point. I think it\u2019d be a really great move.\u201d\n\u201cI do think it makes sense for a lot of reasons. Again, the quality of our game, and also, I think the timing works out great,\u201d he added."

      "text": "The NFL appears to be on a path toward extending the regular season to 18 games, but that was not a topic of discussion at this week\u2019s owners\u2019 meeting.\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said at the conclusion of the meeting that there was no discussion of shifting the schedule from 17 regular-season games and three preseason games to 18 regular-season games and two preseason games.\nThe NFL added a game to the schedule to make the regular season 17 games in 2021, and the 2025 season will be the NFL\u2019s fifth 17-game regular season. The league lengthened the regular season from 14 to 16 games in 1978.\nSuffice to say, no one thinks it will take four decades to grow the schedule from 17 to 18 games like it did to go from 16 to 17.

      "text": "TWELVE MINUTES AFTER booing Roger Goodell as he strode on the set of \"The Pat McAfee Show\" in front of a live audience in the hours leading up to the second round of the 2024 NFL draft in Detroit, fans abruptly changed their tune.\nThe jeers turned to hoots and hollers as the NFL commissioner told McAfee he wasn't a fan of preseason games, and they increased a few seconds later when Goodell said he'd be in favor of eliminating one of the three current preseason games to expand the regular-season schedule from 17 games to 18.\n\"I'd rather replace a preseason game with a regular-season game any day,\" Goodell said. \"That's just picking quality. If we got to 18 and two, that's not an unreasonable thing.\"\nJust like that, a once-dormant conversation was reignited, ripping through group chats and locker rooms. An additional regular-season game seems like a no-brainer win for the league and the fans. That 18th game means more revenue for the league and its owners, and it would push the Super Bowl back to Presidents Day weekend, meaning many would enjoy a Monday holiday after the Sunday night Super Bowl.\nBut for players, it's not so clear-cut.\n\"I think it's up to every player to decide,\" Indianapolis Colts center Ryan Kelly said. \"If they said, 'Hey, you guys get 70% of revenue and we'll take 30 as owners,' a lot of guys would sign up for that if you make $100 million playing quarterback [the current revenue split is approximately 52% to 48% in favor of owners]. So I think everybody's got a line they draw in the sand, and we'll see where that is.\"\nESPN surveyed players from multiple teams for their opinion on adding an 18th game and playing the Super Bowl on Presidents Day weekend. Although most were indifferent about a later Super Bowl, some had strong feelings about adding a regular-season game at the expense of a preseason game, while others were still wrapping their heads around the possibility and the ripple effects.\n\"Eighteen games sounds great when Roger's on the Pat McAfee [Show],\" said Kelly, who is on the NFLPA's executive committee. \"Until you're the one that's going out there and putting the helmet on for 18 of those games, then come talk to me.\"\nAS PITTSBURGH STEELERS safety Damontae Kazee considered the question about an 18-game season, teammate DeShon Elliott stood a couple of lockers away shaking his head vehemently as he overheard the exchange.\n\"Whatever the league gives you, man, you just got to adjust to it,\" Kazee said with a shrug. \"I got to this point in my life, I'm an old head now, about to be 31. You just got to adjust to everything and go on from there. ... Them giving us 18 games, I mean, I wouldn't complain about it.\nElliott interjected: \"I would. They don't pay us enough.\"\nKazee laughed and continued: \"I mean, I'm straight. I wasn't getting paid like this where I was at. ... It can be positive for both sides. People look at it as another week to feed your family. ... I love it.\"\nThat exchange between the teammates is a microcosm of discussions being held in locker rooms around the league.\nOf the players surveyed by ESPN, 46% were in favor of an 18-game schedule with stipulations and 8% voted yes without stipulations.\n\"If they take out a preseason game, I'm OK with that as long as the pay correlates with what they're asking us to do,\" Carolina Panthers tight end Tommy Tremble said. \"If they're gonna make us do one more game, then they need to add something to the check. I'm totally fine doing my job, man. But whatever they decide, hopefully it's for the best intentions of the league and for the players themselves.''\nAdded teammate Josey Jewell: \"Another game equals more money? Sure. Let's do it.\"\nBut to those who went through the contentious collective bargaining agreement negotiations in 2020, adding a second bye week, eliminating two preseason games and depositing an extra week's game check isn't enough.\nAs negotiated in the last CBA, NFL players can receive a maximum of 48.8% of the revenue in any 17-game season. If league owners are intent on adding an 18th game before the expiration of the current CBA in 2030, the union could use the opportunity to increase the players' share of revenue.\n\"They're not paying us enough money already,\" Elliott said. \"They're stingy with their money, so they want to make us play 18 games, as a player union, we should get way more money than what we're getting -- and not just the top guys. And the thing is, they're not out here playing football. They're not here running around putting their bodies on the line. They don't care. All they care about is making money, but if you're going to make money on the top end, the bottom end has to make money too.\"\nElliott was part of the 19% of players surveyed who were completely against regular-season schedule expansion. Fellow Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick is part of that group, too.\n\"Why do we keep adding games?\" Fitzpatrick asked. \"I think 17 is more than enough, plus a playoff. ... The dudes that play a hundred percent of the snaps in the regular season are probably barely playing in the [removed] preseason game, so it doesn't really do too much.\"\nFor many of those players, no amount of compromise and extra money can account for the extra risk to player health and safety.\n\"You're talking about player safety, but how do you have player safety when you add a game?\" Steelers offensive lineman James Daniels said. \"If they were worried about player safety, it would take away games, but it's not about player safety, it's about money and extra games -- an extra prime-time game -- that brings millions of dollars to the NFL, millions of dollars to cities everywhere. I understand it from both sides.\"\nBuffalo Bills offensive lineman Dion Dawkins echoed Daniels, adding that longer seasons can increase the injury risk and shorten careers, all while decreasing opportunities for players to prepare for their inevitable life after football.\n\"It's hard to grow yourself,\" Dawkins said. \"I'm so big into playing ball, like No. 1. But you still have to grow your person for when football is over, right? And when it comes to them 18 games, it just shortens that time for when the offseason comes and you can really dive into who you really are. And your most valuable asset is when you're playing. When you're not playing, nobody cares, and it sucks, but you have to build yourself so when you're done playing, you're relevant.\"\nWhile more than half of players surveyed raised points for and against an expanded schedule, 27% of respondents didn't have a concrete response to a potential 18-game proposal.\n\"It's a long season, man,\" San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy said. \"You go through so much physically and mentally and everything. But if we're going to extend it another game, I think another bye would be pretty nice. But at the same time it's longer ... I don't really know how I feel 100% on it yet.\"\nAnd many others expressed apathy and a resignation that they'd end up doing whatever others decided.\n\"It's above my pay grade,\" Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf said. \"So if we play 18 games, I'll be out there for 18 games.\"\nOF ALL THE ideas the commissioner floated in that McAfee interview, the suggestion of a Presidents Day weekend Super Bowl earned the loudest applause from the fans gathered outside the set.\nAnd yes, a byproduct of an 18-game schedule with an additional bye week is bumping back the Super Bowl to the third weekend in February, making the day after the Super Bowl a national holiday. A fan's dream come true.\n\"I think [fans] should have that day off [after] anyway,\" Bills defensive lineman DaQuan Jones said.\nPanthers running back Miles Sanders deflected the question.\n\"Hey, man, we've got to make it there first,\" he said.\nLike Sanders, many players in the league care less about the date of the big game and more about simply being in it -- even if it means they're playing an extra-long season.\n\"A couple people are going to feel like [NBA MVP Nikola] Jokic -- ready to go home,\" Las Vegas Raiders cornerback Nate Hobbs said. \"But, it takes what it takes. The real champions are going to emerge, and the real, mentally strong survive. And I know we've got that on our team, so it really don't matter.\n\"Presidents Day and February all run into each other. To me, it's all the same. It is what it is, man. I know it's all for entertainment.\"\nTHE IDEA OF an 18-game schedule -- and the division around it -- is hardly new. League owners first formally proposed an \"enhanced\" schedule in 2010, offering to eliminate two preseason games in exchange for the addition of two regular-season games.\nIn response, the NFLPA's good-faith counterproposal asked for a reduced voluntary workout period, two bye weeks and a specific number of helmet-less and pad-less practices during training camp.\nAt the time, some of the league's most prominent figures spoke out against it. \"Don't get me wrong, I love the game of football,\" then-Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis said in 2010. \"If fans want to show their love, they should let everyone know that we are not machines. I've been blessed to play this game for so long, but it's time to start thinking about what legacy and impact changes like this will leave for the players of tomorrow and us after we retire.\n\"I know our fans may not like preseason games, and I don't like all of them, but swapping two preseason games for two end-of-season games -- when players already play hurt -- comes at a huge cost for the player and the team.\"\nNearly a decade after the 2011 lockout, a tightly contested 2020 CBA allowed for a one-game addition to the regular season in addition to an expanded playoff field.\nAs expected, the league wasted little time implementing that extra regular-season game, moving to a 17-game schedule beginning with the 2021 season.\nWhile league owners were nearly unanimous in efforts to expand the schedule during previous CBA negotiations, there are signs that not all would be on board with the move to 18 games.\n\"Substituting a regular-season game for a preseason game is probably more acceptable for the fans,\" New York Giants owner John Mara said in May. \"I can't say I'm necessarily crazy about extending the season. I worry more about player fatigue and wear and tear on the players moving forward. That's one of the reasons why we have to have the discussion with them.\"\nEven if public opinion -- and some locker room opinion -- strongly supports adding an 18th game, there's a steep mountain to climb to expand the schedule.\nFor the two sides to engage in negotiations before the current CBA's expiration after the 2030 season, the owners would first have to come to a consensus about the 18-game schedule. Then, after presenting a proposal to the league, the ownership group and NFLPA would engage in negotiating an entirely new CBA -- think of it as ratifying a new constitution rather than simply adding an amendment.\nIn those negotiations, the union would undoubtedly come up with its own wish list to facilitate acceptance of the additional game -- a list that could include a revamped offseason workout schedule as well as an improved revenue split. Once negotiations were hammered out, a vote would go to the NFLPA board and membership to ratify a new CBA, with a majority needed for approval.\nWith a push toward 18 games comes rare leverage for the players. It's an opportunity that doesn't come along often, one the league's players are carefully mulling as calls intensify for more games and longer seasons.\n\"I'm always down to play more football,\" Raiders wide receiver Davante Adams said. \"But it makes more sense when you're fighting for something, too.\"\nESPN reporters Ben Baby, Alaina Getzenberg, Paul Gutierrez, Brady Henderson, Stephen Holder, David Newton and Nick Wagoner contributed to this story."

  "argos_summary": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said an 18\u2011game regular season could shift the Super Bowl to Presidents Day weekend, sparking fan enthusiasm but raising player concerns over added injury risk and pay. Goodell noted the change would require an 18\u2011week schedule and a second bye week, while the NFLPA has yet to formally discuss the proposal. Players are divided, with many demanding higher compensation or additional bye weeks, and the league must negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement before the 2030 deadline to make the change possible.",
