      "text": "Bakkt Holdings, Inc., a once-diversified digital asset platform, is living that adage out in real time. The company is emerging from a period of recalibration, having lost some crucial banking partners this year, with a new focus, a new leadership team and a new vision for domestic digital assets.\nThat vision? To become a pure-play infrastructure provider for programmable money and agentic commerce.\n\u201cBakkt\u2019s evolution into a focused crypto infrastructure company is accelerating with remarkable momentum,\u201d Andy Main, co-CEO and president of Bakkt, told investors on Monday\u2019s (May 12) first quarter 2025 earnings call. \u201cThe regulatory tailwinds we are experiencing have created unprecedented opportunity.\u201d\nBacked by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt is shifting away from its early multi-pronged approach to crypto and loyalty services. It is repositioning itself as a leaner, more nimble company squarely focused on global digital payments and regulated crypto trading.\nPer executives and company materials, in Q1 2025, Bakkt entered into a cooperation agreement with Distributed Technologies Research (DTR), aiming to integrate DTR\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) and stablecoin payment infrastructure into Bakkt\u2019s regulated trading platform.\nCo-CEO Akshay Naheta emphasized the transformative potential of this partnership.\n\u201cBy integrating DTR\u2019s cutting-edge payments infrastructure and AI capabilities with Bakkt\u2019s U.S. regulated trading platform, we will create a comprehensive ecosystem designed for frictionless movement between crypto trading, AI-powered solutions and global digital payments,\u201d Naheta said.\nThe collaboration is expected to culminate in a commercial agreement by Q3 2025, introducing new products such as a merchant checkout widget and a white-label AI-powered plug-in for global money movement.\nSee also: Bakkt Ditches Custody Business, Names New Co-CEO, and Bets Everything on Crypto\nAgentic Commerce and the DTR Pivot\nCentral to Bakkt\u2019s proposed transformation is its deepening alliance with DTR. While still contingent on a definitive commercial agreement, the partnership signals a move into agentic commerce: a potentially new frontier where AI agents initiate programmable payments across borders in real time.\nThe cooperation agreement with DTR grants Bakkt early access to DTR\u2019s infrastructure. This includes APIs for AI-driven payments, fiat-to-stablecoin bridges, and foreign exchange settlements in over 90 countries. The technology stack is expected to be SOC 2-compliant and fully integrated with Bakkt\u2019s existing platform.\nThe pivot comes after a challenging period for Bakkt. In 2024, the company began a strategic retreat from non-core offerings. A definitive agreement has already been signed to divest its crypto custody business, and further talks are underway to sell its loyalty division. These moves are designed to concentrate resources on crypto infrastructure and digital payment solutions.\nDespite its momentum, Bakkt faces material headwinds. Revenue, while bolstered by crypto trading, remains volatile. Until the DTR agreement is finalized and successfully integrated, the company\u2019s new product roadmap is still theoretical.\nOperationally, the shift from a diversified service model to a specialized infrastructure play requires flawless execution. Bakkt will need to attract global partners, manage compliance across jurisdictions, and deliver seamless UX \u2014 all while maintaining tight cost discipline.\nRead more: Bakkt Suffers Major Setback as Bank Partners Drop Platform\nThe Stablecoin Surge \u2014 and Bakkt\u2019s Bet\nStablecoins, once viewed as niche crypto tools, are now at the heart of Bakkt\u2019s strategy. Stablecoins currently account for just 3% of cross-border payments volume, but Bakkt\u2019s leadership cited forecasts that suggest a leap to 20%, or $64 trillion, by 2032.\nBakkt is positioning itself as a conduit for these flows. With DTR\u2019s ION network, the firm plans to offer on-chain FX conversion, cross-border settlements and regulatory-compliant custody in over 90 countries. Future products include \u201cBakkt Checkout,\u201d which will allow merchants to accept stablecoin payments and receive instant fiat conversion, and \u201cBakkt Agent,\u201d an AI-driven plugin for global money movement through chat or voice.\n\u201cWe\u2019re enabling intent-driven financial actions \u2014 from voice-activated payments to seamless global settlements. No wallets to download, no clunky onboarding,\u201d said Ankit Khemka, Bakkt\u2019s new Chief Product Officer and a former Revolut executive. \u201cThink of it as programmable money, with AI doing the heavy lifting.\u201d\nFor the most recent quarter, Bakkt posted Q1 net revenues of $12.6 million, down 25.9% year-over-year, due in part to the departure of key partners like Webull and declining loyalty program transactions.\nAnd while notional crypto trading volume dipped 39.1% quarter-over-quarter following a post-election cool-off, it still rose 16.6% year-over-year to $1.06 billion. The firm\u2019s crypto-enabled accounts continue to climb, reaching 6.8 million, while assets under custody grew 52.5% YoY to $1.87 billion \u2014 mirroring broader crypto market growth.\nThere was no Q&A portion of the earnings call, and Bakkt\u2019s share price remained relatively stable in after-hours trading."
