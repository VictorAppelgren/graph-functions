Learn how to time your next trade here \u2192\nPresident Donald Trump has reportedly indicated that he may expand the use of military forces to other U.S. cities after deploying thousands of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. as part of his campaign against violent crime.\nThe president said Chicago could be next, criticizing the city\u2019s leadership and vowing to \u201cstraighten out\u201d its public safety issues, reports The Daily Beast.\nTrump told reporters that the National Guard\u2019s presence in the nation\u2019s capital had restored order and claimed residents had lived in fear for years before the intervention. He praised the troops for coordinating with local law enforcement while insisting that the deployment of \u201cregular military\u201d forces had not yet been necessary.\nRoughly 2,000 troops remain stationed in Washington, concentrated around Union Station and the National Mall.\nTrump asserted the crackdown was working, pointing to a week without homicides as proof of success, although crime data shows several similar stretches earlier in the year without federal involvement.\nCrime in D.C. rose sharply in 2023 but has since declined, with homicides and carjackings returning closer to pre-pandemic levels, The Daily Beast adds.\nThe president singled out Chicago as the next likely target for troop deployment, saying \u201cChicago\u2019s a mess\u201d and accusing its mayor of incompetence. He also floated the idea of extending the effort to New York and Los Angeles.\nTrump admitted he had not spoken with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker but suggested Democrats were privately asking for federal help, though he did not provide names.\nBy law, federal control of Washington\u2019s police force cannot extend past 30 days without congressional approval.\nTrump, however, argued that a national emergency declaration would allow him to keep troops in place \u201cas long as I want.\u201d\nCritics have warned that his portrayal of Washington as uniquely dangerous contradicts statistics and exaggerates the level of violence compared with other U.S. cities.\nRead Next:\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "President Donald Trump nominated Sergio Gor, his head of presidential personnel, as U.S. Ambassador to India on Friday, despite ongoing controversies surrounding Gor\u2019s background and a public feud with Elon Musk over alleged federal document falsification.\nStrategic Appointment During Diplomatic Crisis\nTrump announced the nomination on Truth Social, stating he was \u201cpromoting Sergio Gor to be our next United States Ambassador to the Republic of India, and Special Envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs.\u201d The president cited Gor\u2019s loyalty and claimed his team placed nearly 4,000 people across government, though this figure remains unverified.\nThe nomination comes as U.S.-India relations face significant strain over trade disputes and Russian oil purchases. Trump threatened to \u201csubstantially\u201d raise tariffs on Indian goods after India\u2019s continued energy trade with Russia, which now accounts for 39% of India\u2019s oil imports compared to 2.5% pre-war.\nGor\u2019s Background and Qualifications\nAccording to The New York Times report, Gor previously worked for Senator Rand Paul and maintained close relationships with Trump\u2019s extended circle, including Donald Trump Jr. He helped create a publishing venture that paid millions to Trump for book production while out of office and ran a super political action committee (PAC) supporting the president in 2024, backed heavily by former Marvel Entertainment executive Isaac Perlmutter.\nTrump praised Gor as a \u201cgreat friend, who has been at my side for many years,\u201d emphasizing the importance of having someone he can \u201cfully trust\u201d in the world\u2019s most populous region. The bilateral trade relationship topped $129 billion last year, making the ambassadorial role crucial during current tensions over India\u2019s Russian oil purchases.\nConfirmation Challenges Amid Musk-Gor Feud\nThe appointment faces complications from Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk\u2018s public accusations that Gor \u201cdeliberately lied about where he was born on Federal forms,\u201d calling it a \u201cserious crime.\u201d\nThe feud escalated after Gor reportedly pushed Trump to pull Jared Isaacman\u2019s NASA nomination, further straining Musk\u2019s ties with the White House. Though the White House maintains that Gor has undergone proper vetting and holds the necessary security clearance.\nGor requires Senate confirmation for the ambassadorship, though his special envoy role needs only presidential appointment.\nRead Next:\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Sunday pledged to remove homeless people from Washington, D.C., and put criminals \"in jail,\" escalating a public safety push that city leaders say overstates current crime levels.\nWhat Happened: \"The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.\"\nHe said that he will hold a Monday press conference to \"stop violent crime in Washington, D.C.\"\nDetails of the plan remain unclear. A U.S. official told Reuters the administration is preparing to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to the capital, though no final decision has been made and roles are still being determined. Unlike states, where governors activate Guard units, the D.C. National Guard answers to the president.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser rejected the premise of a surge in crime, noting D.C. police data show violent crime down 26% and overall crime down about 7% so far this year compared with 2024. \"We are not experiencing a crime spike,\" she said to MSNBC on Sunday.\nWhy It Matters: The White House last week increased federal presence in the city after a brutal assault on a young administration staffer that angered Trump. By Saturday, officials told Reuters that 450 federal officers were on D.C. streets. On Sunday, Trump posted his homelessness directive and previewed Monday's briefing.\nLegal questions loom. The White House has not explained what authority it would use to evict people citywide. The federal government directly controls federal lands and buildings in D.C. Prior Guard deployments in the District have included the response to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\nTrump has been clear on his public-safety agenda in the capital, including an executive order in March this year directing the cleanup of homeless encampments on federal land and earlier talk of a federal takeover of D.C. governance. Those moves frame Sunday's vow and the potential Guard deployment now under consideration.\nPhoto: noamgalai from Shutterstock\nRead Next:\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

The Democratic governor stated there is no emergency justifying military intervention in Illinois.\nTrump has already stationed approximately 2,000 National Guard troops in Washington D.C. as part of his administration\u2019s crime reduction initiative in Democrat-controlled cities, according to a BBC report.\nDefense Secretary Arms D.C. Troops Amid Expanded Operations\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered National Guard personnel patrolling Washington streets to carry service-issued weapons, reversing an earlier Pentagon directive.

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 National Guard troops deployed to Washington this month to support President Donald Trump's effort to mitigate crime began carrying firearms Sunday evening, according to the federal task force managing the operation.\nThe majority of the guard members will carry M17 pistols, their service-issued weapons, a Defense Department official with knowledge of the planning said, while a small number of the troops will be armed with their service M4 rifles. The troops are authorized to use their weapons for self-protection and \"as a last resort\" in response to an \"imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm,\" the federal task force said.\nA spokesperson for the task force said National Guard members supporting safety and security will be armed, whereas troops who are assigned to \u201cbeautification\u201d tasks across the district, which includes tasks like community restoration, most likely will not be.\nSeveral armed National Guard troops were seen Sunday evening patrolling the Chinatown neighborhood of D.C., wearing patches labeled \"MP\" to signify their role as military police.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday ordered the authorization of roughly 2,000 National Guard troops in D.C. to begin carrying weapons. It marked a shift in the posture of the guard members, who had been unarmed as they worked to support law enforcement by assisting with community safety patrols, traffic control points and crowd flow support.\nThe federal task force said it is \"currently staffing\" a request by local police for \"increased Guardsmen presence at pre-specified metro locations\" to coincide with the start of school year for many D.C. area schools.\nIn carrying out Hegseth's directive, the Army said that \"Guard members receive initial, regular, ongoing and refresher training\" and \"complete annual weapons qualifications, prior to carrying weapons.\"\nA White House official told NBC News that despite being armed, as of Saturday night, the National Guard troops in D.C. are not making arrests and will continue to focus their work on protecting federal assets and providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers making arrests.\nMore than 2,200 National Guard soldiers and airmen, a majority from out of state, have been deployed to D.C. to support what Trump has framed as a concerted effort to tackle crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. At the time of the initial troop deployment this month, violent crime had dropped roughly 27% year over year, according to D.C. police data. Currently guard members from D.C., West Virginia, South Carolina, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee are assisting the District and federal government agencies.\nNearly 60% of guard members in D.C. are from out of the district after several Republican state leaders sent hundreds of troops there. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey deployed more than 400 troops to D.C. \"as a show of commitment\" to Trump's initiative, the most of any state leader.\nDemocrats have bashed the deployment as partisan in nature, accusing Trump of trying to exert his presidential authority through scare tactics and noting that his primary targets have been cities with Black leadership.\nTrump threatened Sunday to send the military into Baltimore after he sparred with Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, deriding the city as \"crime-ridden.\"\n\u201cBut if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the \u2018troops,\u2019 which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social, using a derogatory nickname to refer to Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.\nDeploying the National Guard to cities like D.C. is historically uncommon, as the force is typically used to respond to situations like natural disasters and civil unrest."
