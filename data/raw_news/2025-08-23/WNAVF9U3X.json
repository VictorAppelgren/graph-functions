  "title": "X Agrees to Settle $500M Class Action Lawsuit Over 2022 Layoffs",
  "description": "The exact payouts were not disclosed, but X has agreed to settle a class action lawsuit concerning $500 million worth severance pay owed to employees following 2022's brutal round of layoffs at the company.",
  "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s X has agreed to settle with thousands of former employees who sued the company after they were dismissed following Musk\u2019s 2022 takeover. Following a decision by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, the upcoming hearing scheduled for September has been postponed.\n\nThe company, then known as Twitter, laid off almost 60% of its employees in the immediate aftermath of Musk\u2019s 2022 takeover, affecting nearly the entire content moderation and communications teams.\n\nThe exact size of the payouts has not been disclosed.\n\nThe news comes after the class-action lawsuit, initially dismissed in July 2024, was appealed. The suit alleged that 6,000 former Twitter employees were owed $500 million or more in collective severance pay. It was brought by Courtney McMillian, the company\u2019s former Head of People Experience, and Ronald Cooper, a former operations manager. They claimed that X failed to adequately inform staff about changes to their severance plan and did not adhere to the plan in place before Musk bought Twitter.\n\nEmployees were originally promised two months of base pay, with an additional week for every year they had been at the company, according to the filing. However, the lawsuit alleged that employees, in many cases, received only one month\u2019s pay.\n\nDespite the apparent end of this case, this isn\u2019t the end of X\u2019s employment disputes. In 2024, some of Twitter\u2019s former top brass, including CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde, and General Counsel Sean Edgett, filed a separate lawsuit claiming they were owed more than $128 million in unpaid severance.\n\nMeanwhile, X\u2019s legal issues in other areas show no signs of disappearing quickly. The platform faces the threat of a criminal investigation in France for alleged \u201corganized interference,\" as well as a revived lawsuit alleging X was negligent in its handling of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and slow-walked its response to reports.",

      "text": "Former Twitter executives sue Elon Musk over firings, seek more than $128 million in severance\nFormer Twitter executives sue Elon Musk over firings, seek more than $128 million in severance\nFormer senior executives of Twitter are suing Elon Musk and X Corp., saying they are entitled to a total of more than $128 million in unpaid severance payments.\nTwitter\u2019s former CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde and General Counsel Sean Edgett claim in the lawsuit filed Monday that they were fired without a reason on the day in 2022 that Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, which he later rebranded X.\nBecause he didn\u2019t want to pay their severance, the executives say Musk \u201cmade up fake cause and appointed employees of his various companies to uphold his decision.\u201d\nThe lawsuit says not paying severance and bills is part of a pattern for Musk, who\u2019s been sued by \u201cdroves\u201d of former rank-and-file Twitter employees who didn\u2019t receive severance after Musk terminated them by the thousands.\n\u201cUnder Musk\u2019s control, Twitter has become a scofflaw, stiffing employees, landlords, vendors, and others,\u201d says the lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Northern District of California. \u201cMusk doesn\u2019t pay his bills, believes the rules don\u2019t apply to him, and uses his wealth and power to run roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Musk and San Francisco-based X did not immediately respond to messages for comment Monday.\nThe former executives claim their severance plans entitled them to one year\u2019s salary plus unvested stock awards valued at the acquisition price of Twitter. Musk bought the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share, taking control in October 2022.\nThey say they were all fired without cause. Under the severance plans, \u201ccause\u201d was narrowly defined, such as being convicted of a felony, \u201cgross negligence\u201d or \u201cwillful misconduct.\u201d\nAccording to the lawsuit, the only cause Musk gave for the firings was \u201cgross negligence and willful misconduct,\u201d in part because Twitter paid fees to outside attorneys for their work closing the acquisition. The executives say they were required to pay the fees to comply with their fiduciary duties to the company.\n\u201cIf Musk felt that the attorneys\u2019 fees payments, or any other payments, were improper, his remedy was to seek to terminate the deal \u2014 not to withhold executives\u2019 severance payments after the deal closed,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nX faces a \u201cstaggering\u201d number of lawsuits over unpaid bills, the lawsuit says. \u201cConsistent with the cavalier attitude he has demonstrated towards his financial obligations, Musk\u2019s attitude in response to these mounting lawsuits has reportedly been to \u2018let them sue.\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "US administrations highlighting the power of tech platforms like Facebook or TikTok to aid and abet foreign political influence is nothing new. Now, France is taking aim at Elon Musk\u2019s X for \u201corganized interference.\u201d\nThe Paris Public Prosecutor's Office has opened a criminal investigation into the platform. In the official filing, X stands accused of the \u201calteration of the functioning of an automated data processing system by an organized group\u201d as well as the \"fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system by an organized group.\u201d\nAccording to French newspaper Le Monde, these are considered \u201cmajor computer hacking offenses,\u201d which can carry sentences of up to 10 years in prison and a \u20ac300,000 (roughly $350,000) fine under French law.\nThese also give the French prosecutor the power to order search operations and police interviews\u2014at least in theory. The filing named both X as a legal entity and specific individuals, though none of their identities were disclosed.\nThe news follows the Paris Public Prosecutor's Office opening a preliminary investigation in February, following a report by a team of French cybersecurity researchers employed by the office.\nThe reports come as X\u2019s involvement in European politics has proved controversial in recent years, to say the least. Musk\u2019s use of the platform to spread support for German's right-wing, anti-immigration, party the AfD has led to widespread condemnation, including Tesla boycotts and plummeting sales in the country.\nThis also wouldn\u2019t be the first time that X has been involved in serious legal proceedings with a major democracy. The platform was involved in a multi-year legal battle with Brazil, which led to X temporarily being banned in the country, as local judges accused it of seeding political unrest. The proceedings eventually led to X paying fines of over $5 million to the Brazilian government.\nNeither X nor Musk has commented on the reports as of yet.\nMany French politicians have spoken out in support of the decision, with French centrist lawmaker Eric Bothorel saying that X has seen a \"reduction in the diversity of voices\" accompanied by a \"lack of clarity\" regarding its algorithm changes. He called X a \"threat to our democracies\" in a recent post on the platform."

These cases illustrate the growing legal scrutiny of Musk\u2019s management of X and its compliance with employment and regulatory obligations.",
