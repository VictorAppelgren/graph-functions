  "content": "Despite the gruesome appearance of a dislocated pinkie finger and the optics of it being the latest worry in a career already full of them, Anthony Richardson appeared to escape with just a minor injury after all.\n\nThe Colts quarterback could return to practice as soon as Saturday, ESPN reported, after X-rays Thursday night \u2014 during halftime of Indianapolis\u2019 preseason opener against the Ravens \u2014 were negative and Richardson was initially considered day-to-day.\n\nThe outlet added that Richardson even made some light throws on the sideline before getting ruled out, an early sign the No. 4 overall pick in 2023 is avoiding the worst.\n\nRichardson\u2019s injury occurred midway through the opening quarter \u2014 on just the Colts\u2019 second drive of the game \u2014 when Ravens linebacker David Ojabo raced toward Richardson unblocked from the left side of the defensive line and dropped the signal-caller for a sack.\n\nColts head coach Shane Steichen told reporters postgame that Richardson\u2019s pinkie finger \u201cpopped out,\u201d and Indianapolis medical staff popped it back in, according to ESPN.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t worth the risk of having Richardson attempt to continue playing, with the 23-year-old in an ongoing competition alongside Daniel Jones for the starting job.\n\nRichardson got the start in the opener, and Jones was supposed to start their second preseason game against the Cowboys on Aug. 16, but it\u2019s unclear if Steichen\u2019s plans will change after Jones entered Thursday and completed 10-of-21 passes during the Colts\u2019 24-16 loss.\n\nBefore exiting, Richardson, who has started 15 games while collecting 21 total touchdowns and 13 interceptions across an up-and-down first two seasons, went 2-for-3 for 21 yards.\n\nHe has also dealt with shoulder, back, foot and hip injuries, as well as a concussion, since joining the NFL.\n\n\u201cI feel like I was doing decent out there, besides that one play right there,\u201d Richardson told reporters postgame, according to The Washington Post. \u201cBut everything happens for a reason. Still got next game, so I\u2019m not too worried about it.\u201d\n\nJones, formerly the Giants\u2019 $160 million quarterback who was released in the middle of last season, signed a one-year, $14 million deal with the Colts to compete for the starting job and revive his career after joining the Vikings\u2019 practice squad late in 2024.",

  "summary": "Anthony Richardson, the Colts quarterback, may return to practice as soon as Saturday after a dislocated pinkie finger during the team's preseason opener against the Ravens. The injury occurred mid-game, but X-rays were negative and Richardson was initially considered day-to-day. Despite making some light throws on the sideline, Richardson appears to be avoiding the worst. This injury comes as part of a larger injury to Richardson's career, which has included shoulder, back, foot, and hip injuries. Richardson is currently competing with Daniel Jones for the starting job with the Colts.",

      "text": "Daniel Jones\u2019 Colts debut did not look much different from his Giants career.\nJones entered Thursday\u2019s 24-16 preseason loss to the Ravens earlier than expected when Anthony Richardson went down with a dislocated pinky on his throwing hand in the first quarter.\nThe Duke product finished his night with 10 completions on 21 attempts for 144 yards. He committed no turnovers but did not lead any touchdown drives.\n\u201cGot to be ready to go. That\u2019s part of the game,\u201d Jones said of replacing the injured Richardson. \u201cSome good, some bad. Caught a rhythm there I think at points, and we were moving the ball well, executing, but a couple things here and there kept us from getting in the end zone.\u201d\nBefore leaving with the injury, Richardson completed 2 of 3 attempts for 21 yards.\nThe two are in a battle for the starting quarterback position, but Jones didn\u2019t necessarily get a leg up with his up-and-down play after Richardson went down.\nJones took over on third down during the Colts\u2019 second drive, approximately eight minutes into the game, and handled all the quarterback reps until halftime as Notre Dame rookie Riley Leonard played the second half.\nIn Jones\u2019 first full drive, he passed for one first down before Indianapolis was forced to punt on the next set of downs. Jones was sacked for a loss of nine yards on third down.\nHis next time out, Jones led the Colts to a field goal, utilizing two big pass plays of over 20 yards.\nJones followed up the scoring drive with another one-first-down series that ended in a punt and two more drives that wound up in field-goal range, with Colts kicker Spencer Shrader converting one of the kicks.\nLeonard handled the entire second half, but was unimpressive as he tallied 92 yards on 12-for-24 passing with an interception. He added 34 rushing yards, highlighted by a 21-yard scamper, and helped lead the team to its lone touchdown drives.\nAfter the game, Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said Richardson\u2019s pinky \u201cpopped out, popped back in.\u201d\nJones joined the Colts in the offseason on a one-year, $14 million contract for the opportunity to duel with the former fourth-overall pick in Richardson, who has battled injury and inconsistent play through his first two seasons.\n\u2014 with AP"

      "text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr. could return to practice as soon as Saturday after sustaining a dislocated right pinkie in Thursday night's preseason opener, sources told ESPN.\nRichardson was sacked forcefully by unblocked Baltimore Ravens linebacker David Ojabo in the first quarter, leaving the smallest finger on his throwing hand bent at an outward angle as he ran off the field.\nMembers of the team's medical staff quickly popped the joint back into place, and Richardson began testing his ability to grip a football in hopes of returning to the game. He resumed throwing light passes on the sideline. But by then, coach Shane Steichen had made the decision to rule him out of the game, with veteran Daniel Jones finishing the first half before yielding to rookie Riley Leonard in the second half.\nRichardson underwent X-rays at halftime, which were negative, sources said.\nColts players have a scheduled day off Friday but return to training camp in Westfield, Indiana, on Saturday. If Richardson can throw the ball effectively, he is likely to be on the field.\nAfter the game, Richardson said the finger was \"tender,\" adding, \"it'll be a little bit more so in the morning. But I'll be good.\"\nLess clear is how the Colts will handle their quarterback situation moving forward. They have divided starting reps mostly equally between Richardson and Jones, and Steichen had planned to give Richardson extensive playing time in the preseason opener, with Jones slated to see expanded playing time next week. But after Jones came off the bench to play the final 23 minutes of the first half Thursday, that plan went out the window.\nRichardson completed 2 of 3 passes before his injury. Jones entered and completed 10 of 21 passes for 144 yards."
