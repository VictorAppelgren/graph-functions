The show also discussed U.S. policy on the Ukraine war, AI regulation, a federal judge’s order to dismantle a Florida detention camp, and an FBI raid on former national security adviser John Bolton. Analysts debated the implications of Trump’s industrial policy, the independence of the Fed, and the broader geopolitical tensions involving China and Russia.",
