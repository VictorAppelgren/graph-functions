  "title": "5 most underrated Coen Brothers movies",
  "description": "Honey, Don't! is an important reminder that every Coen brothers movie is worth watching, especially the most underrated ones.",
  "content": "The Coen brothers haven\u2019t made a movie together since 2018, which is an out-and-out tragedy. The pair is responsible for some of the best movies in the history of American cinema. With Honey Don\u2019t! hitting theaters now (the second movie Ethan has directed without Joel), it\u2019s worth looking back at all the movies the two of them made together.\n\nMore specifically, we wanted to highlight a few of the Coens\u2019 movies that don\u2019t always get the attention they deserve. These movies aren\u2019t Fargo, but they\u2019re pretty great in their own right.\n\nThe Coens don\u2019t get nearly the respect they deserve when they make unconventional comedies, which is part of the reason Hail, Caesar! was not appreciated the way it should have been.\n\nSet in the early 1950s, Hail Caesar! follows Eddie Mannix, a fixer working for the fictional Capitol Pictures, who is forced to solve all manner of problems related to the studio and its stars. The biggest problem turns out to be a kidnapping plot involving one of the studio\u2019s biggest names. Mannix will have to unravel this mystery before things get out of hand.\n\nYou can rent Hail, Caesar! on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nTo the diehards, Barton Fink isn\u2019t underrated. But if you\u2019re a more casual movie fan, this might seem like one of the duo\u2019s least accessible films, and understandably so. The movie tells the story of a playwright who moves to Los Angeles to write for the pictures, only to find himself descending into some version of hell (maybe literally, maybe not).\n\nOstensibly about writers\u2019 block, Barton Fink is also a movie about the particular nature of life in Hollywood, where creativity and ideas are turned into products, and all the artists can do is try their best.\n\nYou can rent Barton Fink on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nComing just before Fargo confirmed forever that the Coens were directors we should take seriously, The Hudsucker Proxy was the perfect explanation of why some critics were skeptical of them. It\u2019s an unusual comedy that calls back to the films of directors like Preston Sturges and Ernst Lubitsch.\n\nThe Hudsucker Proxy was their biggest budget at the time and also a bit of a flop. Today, it\u2019s clear that The Hudsucker Proxy is one of the funniest films ever made, filled with perfect jokes, even if its story of one man\u2019s rise and fall in business is a little clich\u00e9d. \u201cYou know, for kids?\u201d\n\nYou can watch The Hudsucker Proxy on Tubi.\n\nThe Man Who Wasn\u2019t There (2001)\n\nOne of the most under-discussed movies of their career, The Man Who Wasn\u2019t There is a fairly straightforward noir story set in the 1940s in a small northern California town. Starring Billy Bob Thornton as unhappy barber Ed Crane, the film follows Crane as he executes a blackmail scheme after discovering that his wife is cheating on him.\n\nAs is often the case with the Coens\u2019 movies, things don\u2019t go exactly as planned. Highly stylish and a little depressing, The Man Who Wasn\u2019t There deserves more attention than it received.\n\nYou can rent The Man Who Wasn\u2019t There on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe last movie the Coens made together was also the first one they ever made for a streaming service. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is unlike any other movie the brothers ever made because it\u2019s an anthology film told in six distinct chapters, each of which has its own story and characters.\n\nWhat that naturally means is that some chapters might be more appealing to you than others. On the whole, Buster Scruggs is a portrait of the brutality of the Old West, and its variety is a reminder of the Coens\u2019 originality.\n\nYou can watch The Ballad of Buster Scruggs on Netflix.",

      "text": "Director Yorgos Lanthimos and actress Emma Stone\u2018s latest collaboration, Kinds of Kindness, is currently playing in theaters. Like the duo\u2019s previous two feature efforts, 2018\u2019s The Favourite and 2023\u2019s Poor Things, the film is darkly funny, violent, and sexually explicit. It feels, therefore, like a natural addition to Stone and Lanthimos\u2019 growing collection of projects. There is, however, one thing that separates Kinds of Kindness, which also stars Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Hunter Schafer, Joe Alwyn, and Margaret Qualley, from The Favourite and Poor Things. Unlike those films, Kinds of Kindness is an anthology piece.\nThe film is comprised of three loosely connected stories, which star the same actors, but in different roles. It\u2019s unique in Lanthimos\u2019 filmography for that very reason, but Kinds of Kindness is far from the first movie to tell multiple stories in an anthological format. It is, in fact, the latest addition to cinema\u2019s long list of anthology movies, which includes some of the most experimental and artistically rendered films that you\u2019ll likely ever watch.\nHere are five, in particular, that everyone should see.\nCreepshow (1982)\nDirected by George A. Romero and written by Stephen King himself, Creepshow is a cult classic of the horror genre, and for good reason. Devised by two of the most gifted and twisted horror creators of all time, the 1982 anthology film tells five standalone stories that double as the contents of an in-universe horror comic. The stories themselves are just as terrifically demented as Romero and King\u2019s involvement would suggest, and they\u2019re executed with such uninhibited glee that you can\u2019t help but enjoy the ride that Creepshow offers.\nFeaturing practical effects by legendary movie makeup artist Tom Savini, there\u2019s a handmade quality to Creepshow that only makes its stories of ghostly revenge, alien invasion, intense pathological fears, monsters, and murder seem all the more theatrical and warped. There have been plenty of horror anthology films since Creepshow, but few hold as revered a spot in the history of cinema.\nCreepshow can be rented or purchased on Amazon Prime Video.\nDreams (1990)\nOne of Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa\u2019s greatest late-career achievements, 1990\u2019s Dreams offers eight cinematic vignettes that were \u2014 as the movie\u2019s title suggests \u2014 inspired by recurring dreams that Kurosawa had throughout his life. The resulting film is one unlike any other. It\u2019s an anthology work that simultaneously feels immensely personal and movingly universal, and it features some of the most stunning images that have ever been captured on film. As is often the case with Kurosawa\u2019s movies, there are moments, shots, and scenes in Dreams that immediately lodge themselves in your brain and stay there \u2014 inviting you to rewatch it just to experience them again.\nYou\u2019d be wise to do so. It\u2019s a movie that becomes increasingly special the more you return to it, and its power only seems to sharpen over time. As a film that stands on its own, it\u2019s a transportive, absorbing piece of work that, quite fittingly, feels like it was made not within the confines of our material world, but pulled from a separate, more spiritual place. As a look inside one of cinema\u2019s greatest minds, it\u2019s both inspiring and invaluable.\nDreams is streaming on Tubi.\nThree Times (2005)\nThere\u2019s a double meaning to the seemingly simple title of this mid-2000s masterpiece from Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien. On the one hand, it refers to the fact that the film follows the same two actors, Shu Qi and Chang Chen, as they play different sets of lovers who meet \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 three times. Its title is also fitting for a film that explores three different eras of Taiwanese history. The movie\u2019s first story stars Chang as a soldier who falls in love with a pool hall hostess (Qi) in the 1960s; its second follows a 1911 courtesan (Qi, again) who tries to find liberation and security in her relationship with a oft-traveling freedom fighter (Chang); its third focuses on a popular singer who breaks up with her girlfriend in order to date the male photographer she\u2019d already been having an affair with.\nThree Times\u2018 triptych structure and recurring themes of love and connection allow it to achieve a lyrical quality that is only reinforced and heightened by Hsiao-Hsien\u2019s signature, long camera shots, which repeatedly drift back and forth from Qi and Chang\u2019s faces and bodies without ever cutting. The movie immediately strikes the right chord with its pitch-perfect, mid-60s first story, which would rank high as one of the world\u2019s greatest short films had it been released on its own. It only grows more ethereal and haunting from there as its shifts in time to introduce questions about how the ways we connect and love inevitably change to suit the periods in which we live. Three Times was notably cited by Barry Jenkins as a major influence on his 2016 Best Picture-winning drama Moonlight, and while it may be the least known title on this list, it\u2019s just as worthy of your time as all the rest.\nThree Times can only be watched on DVD at press time.\nThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018)\nLike the next film on this list, Joel and Ethan Coen\u2018s The Ballad of Buster Scruggs was unfairly criticized when it was released for committing the simple crime of failing to be one of its directors\u2019 best films. However, while no one could rightly call the Western anthology movie a masterpiece on the same level as No Country for Old Men, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, or A Serious Man, that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t great. On the contrary, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is one of the best anthology films of recent memory. Comprised of six completely separate vignettes set against the backdrop of the American West, the film is alternately hilarious, heartbreaking, and terrifying, depending on what kind of story its telling at any given moment.\nThe one thing it never is, though, is predictable. Its stories are told with the same idiosyncratic, no-holds-barred sense of spontaneity that has long defined the Coens\u2019 work. Together, the two brothers use their skills here to craft a film that manages to both parody and pay tribute to the violent absurdity, grim ruthlessness, and earnest optimism that defined the Old West. It\u2019s worth seeking out, frankly, for its fifth story, The Gal Who Got Rattled, which may be the closest we ever get to seeing the Coens make a real, proper Western epic.\nThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs is streaming now on Netflix.\nThe French Dispatch (2021)\nThe French Dispatch is, like so many of Wes Anderson\u2019s movies, a dollhouse-like construction. The 2021 film tells both the history of its eponymous, fictional New Yorker-esque magazine and the four stories that make up one issue of it, which are brought to life in stunning black-and-white and color sequences that blend beautifully together. Written and directed by Anderson, it counts plenty of his favorite recurring players among its cast, including Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson, and Saoirse Ronan, all of whom turn in memorable work in a film that ranks as one of this decade\u2019s most underrated.\nWhen it was released in 2021, The French Dispatch was met with lukewarm praise from critics, who were quick to deem it one of Anderson\u2019s minor efforts. It admittedly might not rank as one of his greatest movies, but it\u2019s also far from the slight miss that many called it. The film is another decidedly singular, endlessly rewatchable dramedy from the auteur, and it features a handful of unforgettable performances from some of Anderson\u2019s less frequent collaborators \u2014 namely, Benicio del Toro, Frances McDormand, and Jeffrey Wright. The latter actor gives, perhaps, the most spellbinding performance of his storied career in a sequence that contains a scene between him and fellow Asteroid City star Stephen Park that ranks as one of Anderson\u2019s best ever.\nThe French Dispatch is streaming on Hulu."

      "text": "Blood Simple is a gloriously clean, well-constructed darkly comic noir that rides the border between pure satire and utter nihilism. Forty years after its release in January of 1985, the first Coen brothers film remains one of the defining debut features of the past half-century. Like Athena springing full-formed from the head of Zeus, all of the Coen motifs perfectly formed right out of the box.\nA beautiful visual language\nLike all Coen films before 2004\u2019s The Ladykillers, Blood Simple is officially directed by Joel Coen to conform with DGA regulations at the time which allowed only one credited director on a project. But the brothers have always directed, written, produced and edited their films together, and Blood Simple, with its stylized shots \u2014 a view down the barrel of a discarded gun, two lovers framed in a massive arched window \u2014 is, like all of their movies, a succession of perfect images, gilded in neon purples and deep, dark blues. With director of photography Barry Sonnenfeld, himself later an accomplished director (of 1991\u2019s The Addams Family, among others), the Coens create a parade of painting-like frames almost startling in their ceaselessness, clearly influenced not only by classic noir but also roughly contemporary films like Terrence Malick\u2019s Days of Heaven, with its uncanny sense of the big-sky American west.\nJoel Coen and Frances McDormand\nThe movie is notable for its formation of one of Hollywood\u2019s longest-lasting power couples \u2014 director Joel Coen and his future wife, star Frances McDormand, met at her audition. Unsurprisingly, as with anything in which McDormand appears, the film belongs to her. To the uninitiated, what will be most surprising is the degree to which she sneaks up on the story, taking it over suddenly and without warning after a slow start. She plays Abby, unhappy wife of Texas bar owner Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya, a New York-accented outsider). In the first scene, she\u2019s leaving her husband and hitching a ride with his employee, Ray (John Getz). In the rain-soaked car sequence that plays under the credits, the Coens already introduce the visual theme that reoccurs throughout the movie, as an almost epilepsy-inducing passing of shadows obscure Getz and McDormand beyond the point of recognition. If the people in this movie ever truly see each other, it\u2019s only sporadically, and in minute flashes \u2014 no wonder, then, that so many of the subsequent scenes are obscured by the shadows (or shot through the blades) of ubiquitous overhead ceiling fans.\nThe role of comedy\nRay and Abby end up in bed in a hotel room, there to be surreptitiously photographed by the extraordinarily sweaty private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) who Marty has hired to follow them. Marty, wracked with jealousy, hires Visser to kill them both. Visser, though he\u2019s clearly a podunk nobody with his cruddy Volkswagen bug and hand-rolled cigarettes, takes the gig. What follows is enough misunderstanding for a French farce, in which none of the participants are particularly trustworthy, though some are grislier than others. No wonder Visser spends much of the film, including his climactic final scene, giggling uncontrollably. The movie is careful to take its characters seriously, but some of this stuff is just inescapably funny \u2014 Visser, Ray, and Marty are all different shades of stupid, and mostly too weak-stomached to function as the cold-blooded killers it turns out they\u2019ll need to be. Thematically, we\u2019re establishing with the bedrock of a filmic mentality that the Coens would carry into even the most serious of their subsequent films (even their cold butcher knife of a masterwork, No Country for Old Men) \u2014 under the best-laid plans of violent men runs a constant undercurrent of cosmic irony.\nFuture Coen collaborators\nAll of the future regular members of the Coen stable are, like their directors, firing on all cylinders from the get-go. Carter Burwell, who would go on to write music for all but one of the films the Coens made from 1985 until their ostensibly temporary (but still ongoing) breakup in 2018, provides a synth-and-piano score that sounds like a series of sonar messages emerging from the depths of the ocean. Walsh, who would go on to appear in the Coens\u2019 second film, Raising Arizona, puts on a deliciously unintelligible Southern drawl to create a character alternately turgidly unresponsive (a fly seems always to be buzzing around his forehead) and chillingly determined. (There\u2019s even a cameo from future Raising Arizona and O Brother, Where Art Thou? star Holly Hunter, as a voice over a telephone.)\nMcDormand steals the show\nBut again, the movie belongs to Frances McDormand, whose Abby Marty spends much of the movie unaware of the ill-formed machinations of the men in her life and upon whom reality comes crashing in only in the last scene of the movie, which she plays to perfection. There\u2019s an element of Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019s Laurie Strode in McDormand\u2019s Abby as she undertakes her final face-off against Visser in the spare apartment she\u2019s rented to escape from her husband. She, too, sweats (everyone in this movie is always sweating in the oppressive Texas heat), backs up against walls and sinks shudderingly to the ground, a pistol trembling in her hand. But her fiery eyes are unyielding. Julian Marty, Visser, and Ray are fascinating figures from a noir perspective \u2014 like many of their genre forebears, they appear to be enacting every possible safeguard against their schemes falling apart, but they\u2019re constantly making obvious errors, leaving proof of their malfeasance or loose ends they have to tie up. In the last fifteen minutes of the film, Abby, by contrast, is the closest thing the story has to an action hero, clambering along the sides of buildings, firing well-timed shots, and acting as the focal point of one superbly staged piece of violence I won\u2019t spoil here. As in the Coens\u2019 Fargo (1996), in which McDormand plays a Minnesota police officer who needs only a momentary glance at the crime scene to understand everything that happened perfectly, McDormand is the smartest woman in the room. Seems right to me.\nA perfect ending\nOf course, even Abby\u2019s victory is based on the same circumstance that guides nearly everything in Blood Simple \u2014 misunderstanding. (Even as she confronts Visser, she thinks he\u2019s Marty.) In the film\u2019s final shot, Visser, though hardly triumphant, is laughing once again, as much at himself as at Abby. What fools these mortals be.\nBlood Simple is streaming on Max."

      "text": "Dark comedy is where humor meets absurdity, with the best films in the genre delivering laughs from unexpected and even unsettling places. The genre thrives on contrast, often juxtaposing the bleakest realities of life with laugh-out-loud comedy, expertly walking the tightrope between funny and horrifying. These films often expose humanity and society\u2019s flaws, making audiences laugh while leaving them plenty to think about.\nThe best dark comedy movies are the perfect blend of disturbingly grim and outrageously hilarious, from the satirical modern classic Parasite to the \u201990s crime favorite Fargo. These flicks will have fans guffawing one minute and questioning their own sense of humor the next, providing wholly entertaining and unique viewing experiences that cinephiles will enjoy.\nWe also have guides to the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\n10. Get Out (2017)\nIn Jordan Peele\u2019s stellar directorial debut, a young Black man finds himself in a nightmarish situation when his first time meeting his white girlfriend\u2019s parents goes horrifically wrong. Get Out follows Chris Washington\u2019s (Daniel Kaluuya) terrifying experiences when he learns that Rose Armitage\u2019s (Allison Williams) family is hiding a cult-like conspiracy that involves hypnotism and a disturbing form of body-swapping. The Armitages are definitely not the open-minded and welcoming family they presented themselves as, with their sinister secret soon revealed during the surreal weekend.\nGet Out is a social horror movie that embraces dark humor to deliver biting satire on racism. Full of uncomfortable scenes like awkward interactions between Chris and Rose\u2019s family, there are several layers to unpack even before the twisted premise is fully revealed. With the 2017 award-winning film, Peele has established himself as a talented auteur in a genre that has often been used to explore deeper societal issues.\n9. Harold and Maude (1971)\nHarold and Maude is a deliciously dark cult classic that follows 20-year-old Harold Chasen (Bud Cort), a wealthy young man obsessed with death, who spends his days attending strangers\u2019 funerals and staging elaborate fake suicides. Harold\u2019s life takes an unexpected turn when he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman who embraces life with uninhibited joy. She tries to show Harold the value of life and shares her love for the weird and unconventional. Their friendship soon blossoms into an unusual romance, and Harold learns to see the beauty in life through Maude\u2019s carefree spirit.\nDirector Hal Ashby\u2019s 1971 film was initially critically panned, with many appalled by its oddball relationship and macabre subjects like death and suicide. It has since been re-evaluated as one of the greatest movies of the \u201970s, however, thanks to its charming use of black comedy to deliver surprisingly sharp insights on existentialism and what makes life worth living. Harold and Maude\u2018s offbeat humor and romance that challenges societal norms were way ahead of their time, making it a timeless movie to revisit today.\n8. In Bruges (2008)\nBefore Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson starred in the Oscar-award-winning The Banshees of Inisherin, they worked together on another dark comedy directed by Martin McDonagh, 2008\u2019s In Bruges. The film is centered on hit men Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson), who are sent to the picturesque Belgian town of Bruges after a botched job in London. Ray, haunted by guilt over accidentally killing a child during his first assignment, despises Bruges and struggles during the entire time he\u2019s there. Ken, the older and more seasoned hit man, actually enjoys the old medieval town, at least until he receives further instructions from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes).\nIn Bruges soars thanks to the incredible chemistry between the two leads, with Farrell and Gleeson perfectly capturing their opposing characters and the unique bond they have despite their differences. McDonagh\u2019s script is witty, with bleak comedy often rooted in Ray\u2019s inability to accept his own recent mistake. With a clever twist bordering on the absurd, the 2008 British comedy movie promises a one-of-a-kind viewing experience for fans of the genre.\n7. Heathers (1988)\nDirector Michael Lehmann\u2019s Heathers is a genre classic that takes aim at high school life through a darkly comedic story that follows Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder). Initially part of a ruthless clique known as the Heathers in Westerburg High, Veronica grows tired of her role in the toxic group made up of three girls all named Heather. She finds an ally when a rebellious new student, J.D. (Christian Slater), has ideas to end the reign of the popular crowd. Veronica questions her decision when their plan to \u201celiminate\u201d the popular kids, disguising their deaths as suicides, spirals out of control.\nHeathers is hailed as one of the best dark comedies ever thanks to its scathing and unapologetic depiction of the casual cruelty so many experience in high school, especially at the time the film was released. The 1988 film uses humor to deftly touch on more serious topics like bullying and suicide, with Ryder and Slater\u2019s off-the-charts chemistry and wickedly fun performances cementing Heathers as a teen movie for the ages.\n6. A Clockwork Orange (1971)\nSet in a near-future society, A Clockwork Orange is a darkly comedic dystopian film that follows Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), a psychopathic delinquent who leads a gang of \u201cdroogs\u201d in committing heinous acts of \u201cultraviolence.\u201d Alex\u2019s nights of fun and violence abruptly end when he is arrested and subjected to a controversial government experiment aimed at \u201ccuring\u201d his violent tendencies through aversion therapy. Stripped of his ability to choose between good and evil, Alex finds himself unable to return to his past self and is instead reduced to a pawn within a larger battle over free will.\nAmong director Stanley Kubrick\u2019s best movies, A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant adaptation of Anthony Burgess\u2019 eponymous 1962 novel, with the filmmaker using an unsettling and bold approach to produce a satirical masterpiece. The 1971 film uses its bizarre humor to capture the absurdity of a society obsessed with control and the suppression of individuality. Through Alex\u2019s arc, it asks what true evil looks like in a world where unchecked state power can take away humanity, becoming a landmark cinematic masterpiece in the process.\n5. Pulp Fiction (1994)\nThe masterpiece that turned director Quentin Tarantino into a household name, Pulp Fiction is a one-of-a-kind film that stood out for its unconventional narrative. Its non-linear storyline revolves around a colorful cast of characters, including hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and their mobster boss\u2019 wife, Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). In another part of town, a pair of small-time robbers, Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) contemplate their next move. Bruce Willis also makes an appearance as the boxer Butch Coolidge.\nDivided into seemingly unrelated segments that eventually converge, Pulp Fiction tells its crime-thriller narrative with a healthy dose of dark comedy. Its sharp dialogue and unexpected reveals are all delivered with comedy that embraces absurdity, often mixing casual conversations with sudden bursts of violence. The 1994 movie\u2019s twisted sense of humor would prove to be incredibly influential, ensuring Tarantino\u2019s spot among the most outstanding talents of his generation.\n4. American Psycho (2000)\nAmerican Psycho is a dark comedy, satirical horror, and psychological thriller film all in one. Directed by Mary Harron and set in 1980s Manhattan, it follows the wealthy investment banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who is the epitome of the yuppie lifestyle by day, with the character focused on appearances, designer brands, and a meticulously crafted persona. This all transforms by night, when his psychopathic tendencies surface and he commits gruesome acts of violence against colleagues, women, and anyone who crosses his path. However, as the film progresses, it becomes unclear whether Bateman\u2019s brutal actions are delusions or not.\nWith its razor-sharp satire of consumer culture and brilliant use of humor to critique the excesses of wealth and vanity, American Psycho deserves its reputation as a widely celebrated classic. Its wickedly funny social commentary is delivered through both the mundane \u2014 such as Bateman\u2019s obsessively detailed skincare routine \u2014 and the disturbing \u2014 like every bloody murder in his apartment. The 2000 movie successfully exposes the superficiality of the yuppie lifestyle and the dehumanizing effects of capitalism while offering a wildly entertaining viewing experience.\n3. Fargo (1996)\n\u201cOh, geez\u2026\u201d Director Joel and Ethan Coen\u2018s Fargo is a crime comedy film that takes place in Minnesota and North Dakota, where Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a struggling car salesman, plans to have his wife kidnapped so he can extort ransom money from his rich father-in-law. This plan quickly spirals out of control, however, with the criminals he hires leaving dead bodies behind. The investigation into these crimes is led by Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a pregnant and unflappably cheerful police chief, who slowly pieces together the bizarre puzzle.\nFull of Midwestern charm and unexpected dark humor, Fargo relies on the bizarre juxtaposition between the brutality of the crimes it depicts and the Coen brothers\u2019 signature wit. The film is full of deadpan interactions and moments that capture the quirks of Midwestern life. It also undoubtedly soars thanks to an Oscar-award-winning performance from McDormand, whose earnestness and warmth make it impossible not to root for her success.\n2. Parasite (2019)\nA film that needs no introduction and certainly the best among the recent string of eat-the-rich movies, Parasite became an international phenomenon when it first premiered. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, it has a deceptively simple premise that\u2019s centered on the underprivileged Kim family, who infiltrate the wealthy Park family\u2019s household by posing as skilled workers. As they enjoy their new jobs and time spent in the Kims\u2019 huge house, the story takes an sudden genre-bending turn that leads to some startling consequences in the final act.\nOften hailed as a modern masterpiece, Parasite is a grim portrayal of the violence of class disparity and the universal reality that is inequality. It not only entertains with its incisive satire, but shocks with an iconic twist that forces audiences to confront uncomfortable truths about privilege. The 2019 movie would become a global hit and make history as the first non-English-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, among other well-deserved prestigious accolades that reflect its status as a legendary work from South Korea.\n1. Dr. Strangelove (1964)\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a quintessential dark comedy that satirizes the Cold War-era paranoia and the terrifying prospect of nuclear annihilation. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film portrays a catastrophic series of events set in motion by a deranged U.S. Air Force general, Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who orders a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union where he believes a communist plot is brewing. As the U.S. government scrambles to recall the bombers, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and his advisers, including the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (also Sellers), gather in the War Room to prevent a global catastrophe.\nAn acerbic satire that\u2019s still painfully relevant six decades later, Dr. Strangelove showcases the very real fears people had about their safety and society\u2019s fragility in the face of devastating weapons. It forces viewers to laugh at Cold War logic, where the fate of the world hinges on the irrational decisions of a few powerful men. Sellers expertly portrays this absurdity in his career-defining performance that sees him play three characters that have become synonymous with the genre."
