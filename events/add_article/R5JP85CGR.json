      "summary": "Russian and Belarusian gymnasts, including Olympic champion Angelina Melnikova, have been granted neutral athlete status by the FIG for the Paris World Challenge Cup, sparking backlash. The decision violates FIG neutrality criteria, as Melnikova is linked to the Russian military and has publicly supported the Ukraine war. Ukrainian officials, led by the UGF, have threatened protests and called the move sport‑washing. The controversy highlights tensions between sports governance and geopolitical conflict.",
