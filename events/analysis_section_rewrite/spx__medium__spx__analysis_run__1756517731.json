      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – Add an explicit handle reference for the ticker:  \n   - `CRWD: +6.4% (fair‑value upside)` – cite KNWKYIQ1W.  \n   - Also map the 22.4% revenue growth to `CRWD: +22.4% YoY` (KNWKYIQ1W).  \n   - If you mention margin improvement, map to `CRWD: +8.1% (target) from -4.2% (current)` (KNWKYIQ1W).\n\n2. **Catalyst Window** – Clearly state the 3–6 month window:  \n   - “Q3 2025 product rollout (end‑Q3) → first full‑year guidance early Q4 2025.”  \n   - Cite KNWKYIQ1W for both events.\n\n3. **Remove/Trim Generic Sentences** – Any phrasing that does not tie directly to CRWD or its metrics (e.g., “cloud security trend” without a direct CRWD link) should be shortened or removed. Keep only the causal chain that drives CRWD’s valuation.\n\n4. **Quantify Risks & Watch Signals** – Provide concrete ranges:  \n   - “Risk: margin pressure if Falcon adoption < 30% → potential 2–4 bp drag.”  \n   - “Watch: Q3 earnings, Falcon Flex conversion rate, operating‑margin guidance.”  \n   - Cite KNWKYIQ1W for each metric.\n\n5. **Conciseness** – Trim any repetition of the same ID citation; keep one per paragraph or logical block.\n\nApply these edits to produce a 3–6 month, handle‑mapped, catalyst‑driven, concise view that meets the Argos standards.",
