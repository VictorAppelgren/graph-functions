  "content": "Shares of language-learning app Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) fell 6.2% in the afternoon session after the stock continued to pullback following a significant rally the previous week driven by its strong Q2 2025 earnings report. The company had reported a 41% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 46% increase in subscription revenue, exceeding analyst expectations and leading to a substantial jump in the stock price. The rally was fueled by the company's raised full-year guidance and a positive investor reaction to its AI-driven growth strategy and expansion into new subjects like music and chess.\n\nHowever, the current decline can be attributed to several factors. First, OpenAI's GPT-5 launch event featured a demonstration of the new model being used to create a simple French language app & give foreign language speaking assistance. This is clear competition and disintermediation. Stock action also appears to be partly attributable to profit taking, where investors sell their shares to lock in gains after a significant price increase.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $322.88, down 5.2% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Duolingo? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nDuolingo\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 33 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago when the stock gained 3.3% on the news that markets rebounded following a sharp sell-off in the previous trading session as a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. The July Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report revealed a significant slowdown in the labor market, with the economy adding only 73,000 jobs, well below the anticipated 110,000. Furthermore, data for May and June was revised downwards, indicating 250,000 fewer jobs were created than initially reported. This weaker economic data has led investors to increase their bets on a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a rate cut in September has surged to over 80%. Lower interest rates are generally seen as a positive for growth-oriented stocks, as they can boost economic activity and increase the present value of future earnings, fueling broad-based rallies in sectors like technology.",

      "text": "Duolingo (DUOL)\nWe\u2019re bullish on Duolingo. Its fast revenue growth, profitability, and exceptional prospects make it a spectacular asset.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Like Duolingo\nFounded by a Carnegie Mellon computer science professor and his Ph.D. student, Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a mobile app helping people learn new languages.\n- Annual revenue growth of 42.5% over the past three years was outstanding, reflecting market share gains\n- Market share will likely rise over the next 12 months as its expected revenue growth of 29.8% is robust\n- Excellent EBITDA margin highlights the strength of its business model, and it turbocharged its profits by achieving some fixed cost leverage\nIs Now The Time To Buy Duolingo?\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nIs Now The Time To Buy Duolingo?\nDuolingo\u2019s stock price of $343.90 implies a valuation ratio of 48.8x forward EV/EBITDA. There\u2019s no denying that the lofty valuation means there\u2019s much good news priced into the stock.\nIf you like the company and believe the bull case, we suggest making it a smaller position as our analysis shows high-quality companies outperform the market over a multi-year period regardless of valuation.\n3. Duolingo (DUOL) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nLanguage-learning app Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 41.5% year on year to $252.3 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was optimistic at $259 million at the midpoint, 2.3% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP profit of $0.91 per share was 56.4% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nDuolingo (DUOL) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $252.3 million vs analyst estimates of $240.8 million (41.5% year-on-year growth, 4.8% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $0.91 vs analyst estimates of $0.58 (56.4% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $78.68 million vs analyst estimates of $61.07 million (31.2% margin, 28.8% beat)\n- The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $1.02 billion at the midpoint from $991.5 million, a 2.4% increase\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $291.8 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $281.2 million\n- Operating Margin: 13.2%, up from 10.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 34.2%, down from 44.6% in the previous quarter\n- Monthly Active Users: 128.3 million, up 24.7 million year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $15.47 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded by a Carnegie Mellon computer science professor and his Ph.D. student, Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a mobile app helping people learn new languages.\nThe company offers courses in widely-spoken languages such as Spanish, Mandarin, and French as well as less-known ones like Navajo. Duolingo primarily operates through a mobile app that can be downloaded on the app store and uses gamification to engage its users - for example, the app motivates users by awarding points for streaks of consistent practice. Additionally, adaptive learning is used to personalize the learning experience, where content and difficulty are adjusted based on the student's progress and performance.\nThe pain points Duolingo addresses are the difficulty and expense of learning new languages. Traditional language courses require people to be physically present at a scheduled time and can really put a dent in the wallet. Classes might also move at a certain speed, which can be too fast or slow for certain learners. With Duolingo, users can learn wherever there is an internet connection, on their own schedule, and at their own pace. All this for free (ad-supported tier) or a reasonable cost.\nThe company utilizes both a free version (ad-supported tier) and a paid version. Its main source of revenue is from subscriptions, and there are various tiers with more expensive ones providing more courses, features, and practice or assessment materials. Duolingo also generates revenue through advertising, partnerships, and language proficiency tests where the company offers assessments that are accepted by many universities and institutions around the world. For example, the Duolingo English Test is used by thousands of universities and institutions worldwide as a measure of proficiency.\n4. Consumer Subscription\nConsumers today expect goods and services to be hyper-personalized and on demand. Whether it be what music they listen to, what movie they watch, or even finding a date, online consumer businesses are expected to delight their customers with simple user interfaces that magically fulfill demand. Subscription models have further increased usage and stickiness of many online consumer services.\nCompetitors offering language-learning services include Coursera (NYSE:COUR) and private companies Rosetta Stone, Babbel, Busuu, and Lingvist.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Over the last three years, Duolingo grew its sales at an incredible 42.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth surpassed the average consumer internet company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis.\nThis quarter, Duolingo reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 41.5%, and its $252.3 million of revenue beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 4.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 34.5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 27.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is admirable and suggests the market sees success for its products and services.\n6. Monthly Active Users\nUser Growth\nAs a subscription-based app, Duolingo generates revenue growth by expanding both its subscriber base and the amount each subscriber spends over time.\nOver the last two years, Duolingo\u2019s monthly active users, a key performance metric for the company, increased by 36.5% annually to 128.3 million in the latest quarter. This growth rate is among the fastest of any consumer internet business and indicates its offerings have significant traction.\nIn Q2, Duolingo added 24.7 million monthly active users, leading to 23.8% year-on-year growth. The quarterly print was lower than its two-year result, suggesting its new initiatives aren\u2019t accelerating user growth just yet.\nRevenue Per User\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track because it measures how much the average user spends. ARPU is also a key indicator of how valuable its users are (and can be over time).\nDuolingo\u2019s ARPU growth has been mediocre over the last two years, averaging 3.9%. This isn\u2019t great, but the increase in monthly active users is more relevant for assessing long-term business potential. We\u2019ll monitor the situation closely; if Duolingo tries boosting ARPU by taking a more aggressive approach to monetization, it\u2019s unclear whether users can continue growing at the current pace.\nThis quarter, Duolingo\u2019s ARPU clocked in at $1.97. It grew by 14.2% year on year, slower than its user growth.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nA company\u2019s gross profit margin has a significant impact on its ability to exert pricing power, develop new products, and invest in marketing. These factors can determine the winner in a competitive market.\nFor internet subscription businesses like Duolingo, gross profit tells us how much money the company gets to keep after covering the base cost of its products and services, which typically include customer service, data center and infrastructure expenses, royalties, and other content-related costs if the company\u2019s offerings include features such as video or music.\nDuolingo has robust unit economics, an output of its asset-lite business model and pricing power. Its margin is better than the broader consumer internet industry and enables the company to fund large investments in new products and marketing during periods of rapid growth to achieve higher profits in the future. As you can see below, it averaged an excellent 72.6% gross margin over the last two years. That means Duolingo only paid its providers $27.43 for every $100 in revenue.\nDuolingo produced a 72.4% gross profit margin in Q2, marking a 1.1 percentage point decrease from 73.4% in the same quarter last year. Duolingo\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 1.3 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs.\n8. User Acquisition Efficiency\nConsumer internet businesses like Duolingo grow from a combination of product virality, paid advertisement, and incentives (unlike enterprise software products, which are often sold by dedicated sales teams).\nDuolingo is extremely efficient at acquiring new users, spending only 16.8% of its gross profit on sales and marketing expenses over the last year. This efficiency indicates that it has a highly differentiated product offering and strong brand reputation, giving Duolingo the freedom to invest its resources into new growth initiatives while maintaining optionality.\n9. EBITDA\nInvestors frequently analyze operating income to understand a business\u2019s core profitability. Similar to operating income, EBITDA is a common profitability metric for consumer internet companies because it removes various one-time or non-cash expenses, offering a more normalized view of profit potential.\nDuolingo has been a well-oiled machine over the last two years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a consumer internet business, boasting an average EBITDA margin of 25.7%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Duolingo\u2019s EBITDA margin rose by 26.4 percentage points over the last few years, as its sales growth gave it immense operating leverage.\nIn Q2, Duolingo generated an EBITDA margin profit margin of 31.2%, up 4.2 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and because its gross margin actually decreased, we can assume it was more efficient because its operating expenses like marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead grew slower than its revenue.\n10. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nIn Q2, Duolingo reported EPS at $0.91, up from $0.51 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Duolingo\u2019s full-year EPS of $2.42 to grow 59%.\n11. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nDuolingo has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model and cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that enable it to stay ahead of the competition through investments in new products rather than sales and marketing. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the consumer internet sector, averaging an eye-popping 35% over the last two years.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Duolingo\u2019s margin expanded by 26.5 percentage points over the last few years. This is encouraging because it gives the company more optionality.\nDuolingo\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $86.32 million in Q2, equivalent to a 34.2% margin. This result was good as its margin was 4.1 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nDuolingo is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $1.10 billion of cash and $93.84 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $1.00 billion net cash position is 6.5% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n13. Key Takeaways from Duolingo\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Duolingo blew past analysts\u2019 revenue and EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year revenue guidance was raised and full-year EBITDA guidance trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, we think this was a very good quarter with some key metrics above expectations. The stock traded up 10.8% to $381.36 immediately following the results.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Duolingo?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 10:26 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Duolingo.\nThere are multiple reasons why we think Duolingo is an elite consumer internet company. First of all, the company\u2019s revenue growth was exceptional over the last three years. On top of that, its powerful free cash flow generation enables it to stay ahead of the competition through consistent reinvestment of profits, and its impressive EBITDA margins show it has a highly efficient business model.\nDuolingo\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 48.8x. There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s a bit of a market darling given the lofty multiple, but we don\u2019t mind owning an elite business, even if it\u2019s expensive. It\u2019s often wise to hold investments like this for at least three to five years, as the power of long-term compounding negates short-term price swings that can accompany high valuations.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $497.24 on the company (compared to the current share price of $343.90)."
