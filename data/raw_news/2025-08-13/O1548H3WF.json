  "description": "Even Hollywood legends have regrets.",
  "content": "Leonardo DiCaprio has one big regret about his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say it even though you\u2019re here: My biggest regret is not doing \u2018Boogie Nights,'\u201d DiCaprio, 50, told Paul Thomas Anderson, who directed the 1997 porn epic, during an Esquire interview published Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt was a profound movie of my generation,\u201d DiCaprio stated, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone but Mark [Wahlberg] in it.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood icon told Anderson, 55, that he thought \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d was \u201ca masterpiece\u201d when he saw it for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that you\u2019re the person asking that question,\u201d DiCaprio said to the director, \u201cbut it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nDiCaprio turned down the role of Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler in \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d to play Jack in James Cameron\u2019s disaster film \u201cTitanic.\u201d\n\nWahlberg, 54, took the lead role in Anderson\u2019s film about a young nightclub dishwasher who becomes a porn star.\n\nThe movie, which was nominated for three Oscars, also stars Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Heather Graham.\n\nIn 2008, DiCaprio spoke to GQ about choosing \u201cTitanic\u201d over \u201cBoogie Nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I would have,\u201d he said when asked if he could go back and change his decision. \u201cBut it would have been a different direction, careerwise. I think they\u2019re both great and wish I could have done them both.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have been happy to do them both,\u201d the Oscar winner continued. \u201cAnd the truth is, if I\u2019d not done \u2018Titanic,\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t be able to do the types of movies or have the career I have now, for sure. But it would have been interesting to see if I had gone the other way.\u201d\n\nDiCaprio, who is starring in Anderson\u2019s upcoming action thriller \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d told the director that he \u201crarely\u201d watches his own films, but he\u2019s seen \u201cThe Aviator\u201d the most.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply because it was such a special moment to me,\u201d he said of starring in the Howard Hughes biopic. \u201cI had worked with Marty [Scorsese] on \u2018Gangs of New York,\u2019 and I\u2019d been toting around a book on Howard Hughes for ten years. I almost did it with Michael Mann, but there was a conflict and I ended up bringing it to Marty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thirty,\u201d DiCaprio recalled. \u201cIt was the first time as an actor I got to feel implicitly part of the production, rather than just an actor hired to play a role. I felt responsible in a whole new way. I\u2019ve always felt proud and connected to that film as such a key part of my growing up in this industry and taking on a role of a real collaborator for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d actor also explained how he\u2019s made it a point to not overwork himself at this point in his career.\n\n\u201cI do things more sparingly, which means you\u2019re anxious to get back to your real life once you\u2019ve finished filming,\u201d DiCaprio told Anderson. \u201cLife goes on hold when you\u2019re filming. Everything stops and gets put on the back burner in your real life. I might be more concerned if I worked too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo go from film to film, I would be scared about what do I have to come back to?\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate for that.\u201d",

      "text": "The storied Plaza Hotel is bustling as usual on a Saturday night, but the vast restaurant on the first floor is empty. Leonardo DiCaprio has somehow persuaded the hotel to close it off for the two of us, simply so we will be audible and uninterrupted.\nAs we gnaw mainly on bread, the conversation caroms every which way, and there's a lot to catch up on. There are his two latest films\u2014Ridley Scott's Body of Lies, with its black helicopter full of intrigue, violence, and betrayal, which opened in October, and Sam Mendes's adaptation of the classic Richard Yates novel _Revolutionary Road, _which opens next month. Not to mention his reunion with Kate Winslet, his relationship to Scorsese, and, of course, YouTube. Now and again, a waiter pads in and meekly asks if there's anything we need. But for the most part it's just the two of us, occasionally peering around the room, startled by the silence and the sheer ghostliness of hundreds of impeccable table settings on scores of perfect white tablecloths, each unattended.\nLD It's like The Shining in here. Just me and you.\n**GQ It is. Wait\u2014The Shining is in your top five movies of all time, right By definition, then, that's your favorite Kubrick film **\nBy definition, you're very correct, but I think it's hard to\u2026 I don't even define 2001 as a film; it's more of a religious experience.\nDo I have it right that The Bicycle Thief is also near the top of your list\nTop three! That's one of the purest movies I have ever seen.\nTalking of pure movies, have you ever seen the Ealing Studios movies\u2014Alec Guinness, late 1940s\nI haven't seen much of Alec Guinness's younger work. I have seen Brian Atene on YouTube refer to himself as \"a young Alec Guinness.\" Have you seen that Brian Atene clip It was the taped audition that he did for Stanley Kubrick, and he begins [intoning with mind-bending pretentiousness], \"Good day, Mr. Kubrick.\u2026\" It was a YouTube sensation.\nI've seen that. Horrifying!\n[still in the ludicrous Juilliard haughtiness of Atene] \"I like to think of myself as a young Alec Guinness.\u2026 Since I am saying whatever I want to Mr. Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest directors in the world, though not quite as good as Michael Curtiz, the director of The Sea Hawk\u2026\" Brilliant. He's actually kind of a genius.\nDon't. Please stop that.\nYou know, Brian Atene also really did go to Juilliard!\nI'm begging you.\nOkay. But how great is YouTube Endless entertainment. Endless! Every day. What the hell You can type in anything, like \"frogs getting laid,\" and they have, like, seventy clips. It's fabulous.\n**I'm going to avoid spoilers, but I was thinking of your love of The Shining when I watched Revolutionary Road. There's Frank Wheeler, your character, saying, \"I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities\"\u2014and you remember Jack's speech to Wendy in The Shining. **\nYes, yes!\n**\"Have you ever thought about my responsibilities\" Anyway. This movie has you again co-starring with Kate Winslet. How much has your working relationship changed **\nIt felt like no time had passed in the way that we're so comfortable with each other personally and professionally. We've been friends for such a long time, and we knew what boundaries we have with each other professionally, and we knew that we could get great stuff out of each other. She's one of my best friends. But was this different It was, in that we were a part of every nuance of this movie. There was a different level of intimacy. It was a much more hands-on approach, and we were both more responsible for our characters and the tone of the film. That's just something that comes with age and experience. After all, we were barely 20, 21 years old in Titanic.\n**How did you channel the 1950s I mean, the politeness and the measured speech and the, um, not feeling alive Obviously, neither of us is an expert on that, because we didn't live through that time. But you embodied Frank. **\nThe novel was so ahead of its time. The '50s was America's prepubescence, in the sense that we were just developing our moral high ground. People were getting white picket fences and trying to find an iconic American image. The novel is about two people not wanting to conform to that, not wanting to be comfortable in that environment, not wanting to be cookie-cutter clich\u00e9s. They're holding on to their individualism desperately, you know As alien as the '50s seem to us now, we're all still holding on to a lot of that, that picture-perfect image. It's all still there. And here are these two characters striving to live a somewhat bohemian existence. Meanwhile, they find themselves trapped. And I think they were destined to be apart. I don't think the suburban lifestyle is what tears them apart. They're destined to be apart.\nAaaand there's the spoiler.\n[laughs] That is maybe a spoiler; you're right.\nIt's fair to say you've had an unusual life so far. Can you relate to the emptiness and the hopelessness of suburbia as portrayed in that script Or do you need to It's not like your dad was the man in the gray flannel suit.\nRichard Yates's novel is a classic for a reason. The conversations that each character has in his or her head\u2026 While I'm sitting here kissing my wife and telling her how much I love her, and how everything is gonna be okay, there's this inner voice that just detests her and detests my life and knows I'm lying about everything. That inner dialogue in the book was fabulous for all of us.\nWhen you hear Kate's character say you were \"just some boy who made me laugh at a party once\"\u2014how do you relate to that guy I'd bet you've never heard a line like that in your entire life. Has any girl ever hit you that hard Be honest.\nNo. But certainly there have been some cruel words exchanged. And that's what you draw on. Buddy, it's the human things you draw on. We go through life, we meet certain people and have connections with them. And it's much like what Kubrick would say.\u2026\nI love you bringin' that around.\nNo, it's true. It's like in _Eyes Wide Shut. _Two people in a loving relationship who have this stronghold of marriage, but what brought them together A giant accident brought them together. Timing brought them together. It's like when Nicole Kidman is telling Tom Cruise's character\u2014\nHow she'd walk away after one\u2014\nYeah, \"I would have walked away with this other guy.\" I love that moment.\nI know that when you're shooting, you can't judge Frank Wheeler, because you had to be Frank Wheeler. But in the end, looking back on it, what do you make of him\n[long breath] What do I make of him I have compassion for him. Any man can identify with something in Frank Wheeler's character, that desperation and that instinctual urge\u2014to please the wife, to please the family\u2014while simultaneously making himself completely unhappy in the process. [laughs] Do you know what I mean Just wanting credit for saying, \"I did this.\" But at the same time, he's this loathsome creature. He's banging his secretary. I don't even know where I'm going with that, but it's such a human character.\nNot so unusual, really.\nIronically, the women I've heard from who have seen this movie They've sided with Frank Wheeler, even though he's the one going off and sleeping with someone else when he's married and has two kids. They forgive him for that! His lack of control and his self-loathing\u2014they identify with that, I guess. And they think he's trying to do what's best for his family and trying to conform to this environment the best he can. Maybe a lot of guys who see this movie will see him as a weaker sort of coward. But I guess any man can identify with the wanting-to. And also with the need to get credit for doing a good job in a relationship.\nLast time I saw you, six years ago, you also had two movies coming out at virtually the same time [Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can]. Can't you just do one movie at a time\nI know! It always happens. It's happened to me three times\u2014two movies opening within a month of each other. It's because I always have one director who takes way too long to edit and another who flips it out really fast.\nYou've just wrapped your fourth movie\u2014Shutter Island\u2014with Martin Scorsese. What did you take away from those experiences\nFor me, I don't sit there working with someone of that caliber and think, \"What am I learning\" To be honest, I try to be as focused as he is. I try to bring as much to the table as he does. It's less about learning something\u2014although I have learned a tremendous amount from his film knowledge. Every time he and I do a movie, he screens four or five movies beforehand to give me a frame of reference. And every time you have a conversation with him, you know you're in the best possible hands. It's a good experience to walk on a set and think, \"Even though I might disagree with him, his experience trumps mine,\" and so I have no doubts. I'm all good with it. That's a great feeling to have.\n**You two clearly have a shorthand at this point. **\nWe think somewhat alike. And we dislike the same things a lot. We're just very direct with each other. We give each other information in as clear and honest a way as possible, without any fluff around it. He's very blunt with me about how he feels about what I'm doing. There's no one else whose opinion I'd respect more.\nHey, don't talk down Spielberg!\nOh, I wouldn't! I would never. They're similar animals. Working with both of them at roughly the same time, I couldn't help but see the similarities. They're intense film nuts. They grew up living and breathing and eating cinema, and it shaped everything in their lives.\nWhat do you know now that you didn't know when you started out\nThis is what I know the most You have to take full responsibility for your character and for yourself on-screen. You can have the relationship with a director where the director shapes it, but you have to own it. I didn't understand that when I started out. Then, it was always, Let me go to the director and see what he wants. As opposed to bringing something to the table and then having that open for discussion. You have to be able to shock\u2014well, not shock, but surprise the director and sometimes go in a direction he didn't expect.\n**The way Scorsese described you\u2014it was pretty glowing. \"The energy of a young De Niro.\" **\n_[DiCaprio's arms cross tightly] _\nAnd your body language tells me that makes you self-conscious. And it's fantastic that even when I point out the body language, it doesn't change!\n_[laughs] _Yes. Look, any actor would absolutely feel the same way I do about working with a director like that. It's a no-brainer.\nAfter all these years, you're still carrying these cinnamon toothpicks around and wearing baseball caps all the time. What does that logo stand for\u2014\"FAU\"\nI have no idea. But I love baseball caps! This is the real reason I wear 'em I just like the design and the pattern. People come up to me and say, \"You went to FAU!\" Wait\u2014this is Florida Atlantic University.\nYou're just guessing now. So\u2026Body of Lies. You and Russell Crowe, directed by Ridley Scott On paper, that should be an Oscar machine. Don't you think they almost owe you an Oscar at this point After all these performances\nNot at all! Mm-mmm. I've always felt more like I'm in \"proving stuff to myself\" mode. That was one of the roughest movies I've ever done, though.\nHow so\nThe subject matter was very tough. The politics were very stressful. And the locations were hard-core. We were in Rabat, Morocco; Ouarzazate, Morocco; and Washington, D.C.\nWhat drew you to do that film, politically\nI thought it was a very intelligent work about the state of American foreign relations and the way we interact with other countries\u2014and the way they view us. But also, it wasn't in your face, it wasn't preachy\u2014and especially with something as touchy as this, I don't think preachy movies work very well. [wincing] I'm sorry. This shrimp is awful. Try it.\nAre we both going to be vomiting in four hours\n_[in grand, declarative voice] _We are sending it back! I don't gamble with seafood, my friend! It's on my bill, anyway.\n**No, it's not. **\nThat's what I do\u2014I pay for things.\nWhat was your chemistry like with Russell Crowe How was it, getting thrust into the middle of that Crowe-Scott dynamic\nYeah. I went from doing the Kate Winslet suburban-relationship period drama to blowing stuff up in the desert with cars flipping over my head! The dynamic with Sam Mendes and Kate was like doing a stage play\u2014we rehearsed and did take after take and just ground each other down emotionally. And then going to work with Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott They had a real shorthand together. I mean, they'd mumble stuff to each other_ [does some unintelligible rapid-fire Aussie talk],_ and suddenly four scenes would be taken out. And I'd think, What just happened\nRidley's style is completely unlike anything I've ever done. He's able to see the film in his eyes; he's able to edit in his mind while watching seven monitors. And he likes to just throw you into the elements and see what you do. Then he'll come in and say, \"Here's what to change.\" What he's able to pull off with his crews\u2026 I'm in the middle of the desert, and I've got a gun on someone in some cave, and I'll hear from an assistant director, \"We just got word that Ridley wants a 747 flying above you right now. It's just going to be a couple of seconds. It's on standby; it's swirling around, waiting right now.\" There's this intense group of people working twenty-four hours a day, giving Ridley what he wants, and Ridley wants certain things at certain times. It was a badass film to be a part of. It reminded me of a Titanic experience. Jim Cameron would say, \"Okay, we need to flood the top two floors, and I want a giant wave, and I want 400 extras jumping out the window while that happens.\" And I thought, Cool. And someone would say, \"We'll have that for you in twenty minutes.\" And I thought, What That level of organization\u2014I just don't have that type of brain.\nIs it true you had a recurrence of OCD after shooting The Aviator\nI never actually had OCD. I know I did say that at some point, but I didn't. I studied this. OCD is us reverting to a reptilian part of our brain where we have to organize everything. It's about cleanliness and protecting the home nest. That's why you see rodents running around and picking things up and constantly organizing.\nWhat is wrong with you\nHey, that's what it is! We all have that in our brain early in life, but some people get locked in, like a stuck gearshift. That's what OCD is. They can't stop themselves from, say, stepping on everything they see that has a floral pattern. Or thinking, Don't enter this area of the house, because it's dirty. They honestly feel like they will die or something horrifically wrong will happen unless they go through this process. I don't have OCD\u2014I don't!\u2014but I remember when I was little, I would step on cracks.\u2026\nYou would step on cracks\n_[quite seriously] _Didn't you You did, right Well, I stopped doing all that at a certain age. So when I did the movie, I wanted to bring out any compulsive habit I'd had in the past, and it didn't wear off for a year afterward. I was going around stepping on cracks.\nNot stepping around cracks You had, like, reverse OCD. That's ROCD.\nYeah\u2014stepping on them. And for some reason, at airports I had to step on every stain that I saw, so I'd be darting around doing that.\nWas there anything that stuck with you after Revolutionary Road\nIt was one of the more emotionally painful movies. It was depressing, making this film, I have to say. As great as it was to work with Kate, I was happy to get out of\u2026not happy to wrap the film, but happy to stop arguing with my wife for months straight, confined in a tiny suburban house. We were really shooting in a tiny little house, and the entire crew was there, smashed into this little two-bedroom house. There was no way to get out; there was nowhere to run. The claustrophobia was pretty intense after a while. After eighteen months of work, I'm trying to figure out what normal life is like again.\nAre you seeing friends Are you dating a girl\n_[coyly] _I am seeing my friends, yes.\nBut you've never dated a girl\nI have dated a girl. I have, plenty of times!\nYou're not much in the tabloids anymore. Have you noticed that\n[whispers in mock terror] Don't say that too loud!\nAnd by the way, what strip joint are we going to later on\nActually, I'm not in the tabloids anymore. I am sometimes, but I've watched the culture change. I'm old hat. And I love it. You know what it is with me This is something I'd like to clarify. I've heard people say, \"Because you hide, it makes you seem ungrateful.\" The mere fact that these\u2014I'll use the word_ piles_\u2014are earning money from exploiting my image is the only reason I hide myself or am not a photo-friendly person. I do not like the way they conduct themselves. I think they're disrespectful and dangerous. The reason I don't pose or smile or that I seem mad is that I don't want them to make a living off my private life.\nAs a journalist, I resent the idea that you think you deserve a private life. Publicly, of course, you're known for your politics. What does this last eight years mean in terms of energy policy\nDo you realize the progress we could have made Eight years is an unbelievable amount of time. The biggest travesty is that we're the most powerful country in the world and haven't made a tiptoe toward renewable technologies. And we should be the ones paving the way, the ones other countries look up to. That makes me extremely sad.\nThe old hack question Are there films you regret turning down\nSure. _Boogie Nights _is a movie I loved and I wish I would've done.\nYou turned down something for Titanic, no\nThat was Boogie Nights!\nOh! So\u2026if you could go back, would you take Boogie Nights over Titanic\n[pauses for an age; furls brow] Well, that's an interesting question.\n**Isn't it **\nI'm not saying I would have. But it would have been a different direction, careerwise. I think they're both great and wish I could have done them both.\nBut Titanic made you a mega-\u00fcber-superstar.\nI would have been happy to do them both. And the truth is, if I'd not done Titanic, I wouldn't be able to do the types of movies or have the career I have now, for sure. [pauses again] But it would have been interesting to see if I had gone the other way.\nEven for you, it's hard not to wonder about the road not traveled. Which brings me back to Revolutionary Road. Yates said it was about \"a lust for conformity\" and Americans grasping for \"security at any price.\" Ring any bells\nYeah. Well, I just hope our country has learned its lesson and can go in another direction. We _all _do, right I hope that things can change. There's so much to do. Ahhh, I could go on a rant here\u2014but I'm not gonna do it!\nMarshall Sella ** _is a _ GQ** correspondent_._"

      "text": "A Leonardo DiCaprio performance is always an intense experience: Howard Hughes losing his mind, Jordan Belfort debasing himself, Hugh Glass surviving against all odds. We are watching one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest of all time at work.\nHis latest film, One Battle After Another, is no exception. DiCaprio plays Bob Ferguson, a washed-up revolutionary and dad to a teenage daughter, Willa, played by Chase Infiniti in her first film role. Opposite him are Teyana Taylor as the absent mom, Benicio Del Toro as the ally, and Sean Penn as the villain. One Battle After Another is a big movie\u2014an action film with car chases, a spy-craft yarn with a clandestine agent who\u2019s drunk and stoned, and a political thriller with reverberations for our interesting times. But at its core, the movie is a story about a father and daughter and what it means to show up for the people you love. It\u2019s also very funny.\nThe writer and director is Paul Thomas Anderson, whose films\u2014like Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and There Will Be Blood\u2014are operatic renderings of human frailty. The movies are visceral and often haunting. They can also be hilarious, and they\u2019re always wildly entertaining.\nOne Battle After Another is his first film with DiCaprio. Both men rarely give interviews, and their life and work are the subject of bottomless curiosity and speculation. This summer, they had two conversations: one in Leo\u2019s kitchen, another over the phone. They recorded their talks and gave the transcripts to Esquire, which we edited and condensed. (Anderson also photographed DiCaprio for us in Los Angeles.) We gave them some prompts, some of which they indulged, others not so much. But the result is a rare glimpse into the minds of two of Hollywood\u2019s most daring and original men.\nPaul Thomas Anderson: Any regrets?\nLeonardo DiCaprio: I\u2019ll say it even though you\u2019re here: My biggest regret is not doing Boogie Nights. It was a profound movie of my generation. I can\u2019t imagine anyone but Mark [Wahlberg] in it. When I finally got to see that movie, I just thought it was a masterpiece. It\u2019s ironic that you\u2019re the person asking that question, but it\u2019s true.\nAnderson: Why did it take us so long?\nDiCaprio: I know One Battle After Another has been on your desk for a long time. It was a personal story for you in a lot of ways and certainly pertinent to the world that we\u2019re living in right now. But ultimately, wanting to do this movie was pretty simple: I\u2019ve been wanting to work with you\u2014Paul\u2014for something like twenty years now, and I loved this idea of the washed-up revolutionary trying to erase his past and disappear and try and live some sort of normal life raising his daughter.\nAnderson: It\u2019s a nice character, someone who starts out wanting to change the world on the far left but gets increasingly cranky and closed off as he gets older.\nThis article appeared in the Sept 2025 issue of Esquire\nsubscribe\nDiCaprio: And lives in constant paranoia. It was fun creating a character that\u2019s weirdly a hybrid of both political parties and beliefs\u2014and certainly not Father of the Year.\nAnderson: No one can outrun what\u2019s inevitable, which for him is to be a father and to have another generation come up from behind. So what\u2019s inevitable is middle age. What\u2019s inevitable is complacency. What\u2019s inevitable is looking at the next generation with disdain simply because they\u2019re not doing it how you think they should, which is just a code for \u201cThey\u2019re not doing it like we did it.\u201d And so what comes next is being cranky, no matter how liberal and rah-rah you were in your youth. When you get down to the mundane, daily battles of life, they just wear on you.\nDiCaprio: Especially if you\u2019re living in secrecy. What are your options? You\u2019re going to sit there and microdose and smoke pot and watch old revolutionary movies and not have a cell phone, right? Which became another huge theme in the movie too.\nAnderson: I\u2019m going to ask you a question, and you\u2019re going to answer as quickly as you can. If you didn\u2019t know how old you are, how old are you right now?\nDiCaprio: Thirty-two.\nAnderson: Good answer. What you\u2019ll have to do is investigate what happened when you were thirty-two, and then you\u2019re going to discover and uncover why that was your answer. Here\u2019s how that relates to your character in the film: He fell in love with a woman named Perfidia. She broke his heart into a million pieces, put it back together, smashed it again, put it back together, and smashed it once more for good measure. She left him stuck in time, unable to move forward. What\u2019s inevitable with that broken heart is to sit around with it for a long time and stew in it. All you do is stay in one place. By the way, my answer was twenty-seven.\nAnderson: By the time I came to you, four or five years ago, the script was probably 80 percent there. I had never quite figured out the story\u2019s policies on phones.\nDiCaprio: You were always into this idea of a no-phones world.\nAnderson: I knew it had to be addressed. You brought me to the idea that Willa having a phone is a choice to rebel against her father\u2019s wishes. Now that was a good idea. It\u2019s always fun when that happens with a new idea, that immediate shift where you lean into something that you were entirely opposed to. The movie benefited from it.\nDiCaprio: It\u2019s about the disconnection between generations. It\u2019s about how this daughter and father relate to one another, and that we are living in a completely different world than the next generation. We think we understand it, but we don\u2019t. This is how they communicate.\nAnderson: If you\u2019re from a generation that either enjoyed or was driven mad by the mystery of wondering where somebody is or when they might call next, or thinking, I have to rush home to my answering machine to find out if somebody\u2019s called, imagine if someone had said you could walk around with an answering machine in your pocket. To her generation\u2019s point, why would I not let somebody know where I am every second of the day? I don\u2019t understand what your problem is. Why wouldn\u2019t you film yourself dancing? How could you dance and not film yourself?\nDiCaprio: I remember with my little sister and her friends, they asked, \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d I lived in the days where there was an answering machine, and when you had plans, you either needed to be there on time, or you\u2019d call on a pay phone to check your answering machine to see if they left a message, to see if they were going to be late. And then you\u2019d have to call their answering machine so they could check their answering machine. They were like, \u201cYou guys must have never had plans\u2014how did you ever communicate?\u201d There was a lot of waiting around; you had to stick to your word.\nAnderson: Do you remember when we were both starting, if you met anybody from the generation before us, and they were successful Hollywood players, they had answering services. That was like, Holy shit, they don\u2019t have an answering machine; they have an answering service.\nDiCaprio: I tried to explain beepers. If it was stressful, you\u2019d say your number and then 911911911. That means stop whatever you\u2019re doing and call.\nAnderson: Well, beepers were generally for drug dealers.\nDiCaprio: That\u2019s not true. We all had beepers.\nAnderson: I never had a beeper. My drug dealer had a beeper.\nDiCaprio: All my friends had beepers. They would click it on their jeans and you\u2019d run around\u2014beep beep beep\u2014just look and like, Oh my homey\u2019s calling, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\nAnderson: Here\u2019s a question Esquire wants me to ask. \u201cYou turned fifty last year. Does it feel like a natural time for reflection?\u201d\nDiCaprio: \u201cYou turned emotionally thirty-five last year.\u201d\nAnderson: \u201cYour age is fifty, but your emotional maturity is thirty-two.\u201d How does that feel?\nDiCaprio: So they\u2019re asking about age?\nAnderson: They\u2019re asking if it\u2019s a natural time for reflection.\nDiCaprio: Well, it creates a feeling like you have a desire to just be more honest and not waste your time. I can only imagine how the next few decades are going to progress. I look at my mother, for example, and she just says exactly what she thinks and wastes no time. She spends no time trying to fake it.\nAnderson: Yeah.\nDiCaprio: Being more upfront and risking having things fall apart or risk the disagreements or risk going your separate ways from any type of relationship in life\u2014the personal, professional\u2014it\u2019s that you just don\u2019t want to waste your time anymore. You have to just be much more upfront. It\u2019s almost a responsibility because much more of your life is behind you than it is ahead of you.\nAnderson: That\u2019s a good answer.\nDiCaprio: What was it about this movie that made you want to dedicate twenty years to it?\nAnderson: Political films can be like eating your vegetables. There are many exceptions of great films that are political; however, right now the only thing I want to see is a story that I can relate to. And the only thing that matters is the emotional. The emotional comes from the story of a family. It comes from the way we love and hate. When films preach, I stop listening. It\u2019s impossible to keep pace with the state of the world\u2014this is why it\u2019s best to focus on the things that never go out of style. You can figure out what never goes out of style by realizing what in a story is going to be the thing an audience really cares about. Our question is: Can a father find his daughter? Or: What does it mean to be a family?\nDiCaprio: You are considered a very art-house director. Would you call it that? What do you call it?\nAnderson: Well, there\u2019s no need to be insulting.\nDiCaprio: No, what\u2019s the term? You don\u2019t do incredibly commercial movies, let\u2019s put it that way. You are a writer, director. You have your own vision. What\u2019s the term?\nAnderson: Box-office challenged?\nDiCaprio: No, you do appreciate big-budget movies, like a Marvel film. I\u2019ve heard you talk about Terminator 2\u2014about going to film school and somebody saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re here to make Terminator 2, you\u2019re in the wrong place.\u201d And you said, \u201cWell, fuck that. Terminator 2is a fucking great movie.\u201d This, to me, is a Paul Thomas Anderson version of an action film. I was like, car chases? How\u2019s Paul going to do French Connection? What is he going to do that we haven\u2019t seen Michael Bay do and make it a Paul thing?\nAnderson: Twenty years ago, I started writing this story, and the kernels of it were basically just to write an action car-chase movie. I would go to this story every couple years. Sometimes I thought I would like to adapt Thomas Pynchon\u2019s Vineland, a book written in the eighties about the sixties. But I was looking at it in the early 2000s, thinking of what the story means at that time. Cut to a whole other story that I had floating around that was about a female revolutionary. In other words, for twenty years I\u2019ve had all these various strands, and in a way, none of them ever went out of style, because whatever seems to be happening politically seems to always be the same. Same shit, different year.\nDiCaprio: A lot of people say One Battle After Another was based on Vineland. I never read Vineland. You never spoke to me about it. There\u2019s a lot of references to the book, but I since have read it, and I see some of the roots of where this story came from, and the whole idea of what happens to these revolutionaries in their post-sixties life.\nAnderson: Vineland was always going to be too hard to adapt, so I stole the parts that spoke to me and just started running like a thief. I guess that\u2019s what all us writers do\u2014we\u2019re fucking thieves. I always liked the structure of Les Mis\u00e9rables. You have a wild and crazy first act, and then you settle into the story, and you must pick up the pieces of the wreckage or you must reckon with the choices you made in the first act. This is a very good dramatic structure.\nDiCaprio: There are themes of Star Wars and Terminator 2 in this. It\u2019s interesting to see how you merged your vision of the zeitgeist\u2014of what everyone\u2019s talking about today politically\u2014but with these very relatable themes for a larger audience.\nAnderson: Those mythical characters, at least the ones those Star Wars characters are based on, have been around forever, and they never go out of style. It is the classic \u201cnothing changes.\u201d The story of a chosen child and opposing forces in pursuit of her magic\u2014this is an oldie but a goodie and certainly one that fits these times. Once you settle into a story that works, the next question is the tone, and our tone ended up reflecting everyone\u2019s character. Our tone reflects the absolute absurdity of human nature.\nDiCaprio: My character is not your typical heroic Terminator-type character that has any superpower, any special ability, but he\u2019s just relentless, you know?\nAnderson: Well, that goes back to\u2014\nDiCaprio: The Bad News Bears. He\u2019s in The Bad News Bears of modern-day dad heroes.\nAnderson: That\u2019s right\u2014he\u2019s got a lot of Walter Matthau from Bad News Bears. When I watched the Mission: Impossible films, they usually start out with a code that Tom Cruise has to give back and forth. I would daydream, What would happen if Ethan Hunt forgot that code word just once? Would the other end of the line say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know you\u2019re Ethan Hunt. Let\u2019s just get on with it.\u201d Or would they say, \u201cSorry, I know you\u2019re Ethan Hunt, but I still need the password.\u201d\nDiCaprio: We had a lot of talks about how to create a heroic character and bring a sense of reality and not have it be the typical choices that we\u2019ve always seen. You said to me, It\u2019s in the relentless pursuit of wanting to protect his daughter, not giving up, being there for her. It\u2019s a story about a father and daughter and what you do in those positions, even if you\u2019re up against all odds. There was some point in which we were talking about him going to John Wick extremes. I was like, No, give me a shittier gun, or what if there is no gun? Eliminating the violence from his character was the key to unlocking him.\nAnderson: I also thought it was interesting that we never quite knew exactly how it was going to end. But I like where we landed. The dramatic center of it was for Willa to say, \u201cWho are you?\u201d Saving the day was you saying, \u201cI\u2019m your dad.\u201d\nDiCaprio: And that\u2019s what the story\u2019s really about.\nAnderson: That\u2019s heroic. That\u2019s more heroic than shooting somebody. Saving her is saying: \u201cI\u2019m the guy who\u2019s been here the whole time. I\u2019m your dad.\u201d\nAnderson: If it\u2019s a Saturday and I\u2019m flipping around thinking, What do I want to watch? chances are I\u2019m going to land on something that has some kind of action-adventure element to it. The first thing that pops to my mind is Midnight Run. I\u2019ve been dreaming of trying to make a film as fun as Midnight Run since I first saw it.\nDiCaprio: A masterpiece.\nAnderson: I saw it three or four times the week it came out. It\u2019s the high-water mark of a great film for a broad audience. Usually we shove an action movie into a section of the room that disallows us from taking it too seriously. There are exceptions, like Mad Max, but for the most part we don\u2019t let our action films cross with our more dramatic stories, as if you can\u2019t have good acting and someone driving a car or shooting a gun. But Midnight Run is the total package.\nDiCaprio: I was recently talking about that movie, and a very famous comedian was like, \u201cThat may be the greatest fucking two-man comedy ever done. It\u2019s brilliant.\u201d When my dad was telling me about what acting is, he took me to the theater in Burbank to watch Midnight Run. He said: \u201cYou want to be an actor, son? That\u2019s the guy right there\u2014that\u2019s acting.\u201d\nAnderson: Do you ever watch any of your old movies?\nDiCaprio: I rarely watch any of my films, but if I\u2019m being honest, there\u2019s one that I have watched more than others. It\u2019s The Aviator. That\u2019s simply because it was such a special moment to me. I had worked with Marty [Scorsese] on Gangs of New York, and I\u2019d been toting around a book on Howard Hughes for ten years. I almost did it with Michael Mann, but there was a conflict and I ended up bringing it to Marty. I was thirty. It was the first time as an actor I got to feel implicitly part of the production, rather than just an actor hired to play a role. I felt responsible in a whole new way. I\u2019ve always felt proud and connected to that film as such a key part of my growing up in this industry and taking on a role of a real collaborator for the first time.\nAnderson: I can stop and watch it anytime.\nDiCaprio: We should talk about Adam.\n[Adam Somner was a British-born first assistant director who worked with Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and Anderson before his death from cancer last year. He is credited as a producer on One Battle After Another.]\nAnderson: Sure.\nDiCaprio: There was nobody like him. The fact that this man would just go to the utmost extremes to somehow bring everything into order was one of the most magical things I would see in my whole career. And he worked with the greatest directors in the world, and they trusted him. It allowed me to watch you or somebody like a Marty juggle so many different departments with so many different questions, which is why I don\u2019t have a powerful urge to direct. Because I\u2019m just trying to figure out what is this line going to be. I would go into a spiraling vortex for hours about how to say that line. I know we get emotional talking about him, but there was just absolutely no one better.\nAnderson: Without question. As it relates to you and me, we had wanted to work together for twenty-five years or something like that. It was always going to be the right time when it was the right time. But Adam, since he\u2019s been working with you, has been saying, \u201cGet going. You guys are gonna fucking love it. I\u2019m telling you because I\u2019ve been with you both independently. Now\u2019s the time!\u201d\nDiCaprio: I didn\u2019t know that.\nAnderson: It was nice that his match of us together got to come true. There was a pretty large waiting room of customers to get the services of our man Adam. I\u2019d like to think I was at the front of the line, but we all know Steven was, as Steven is the king. But the joy of giving him the script and waiting for his feedback and approval, which was always supportive, but he was never a yes-man. He is not going to tell you it\u2019s great if it\u2019s not great. That is worth everything. You\u2019re surrounded by your own insecurities and your own confidence. When one rises, when the other one falls, to have somebody who\u2019s so steady and secure and has good taste on top of talent, well, it\u2019s all you can ask for, and that\u2019s what he was. But he was also somebody who knows how to set a table for an actor, keep it quiet, keep it cool, let them do their work. It\u2019s why Daniel Day-Lewis would fucking not be on a set without Adam Somner keeping it cool, you know? It\u2019s why you feel safe.\nDiCaprio: I remember listening to Marty\u2019s story about Adam when we were doing the orgy sequence in Wolf of Wall Street. We had an intimacy coordinator there for the first time in cinema history, I believe, because it was a full-on Caligula orgy on a 747. Adam worked with the intimacy coordinator, and it was like a dance. Adam would say, nasty bit, nasty bit, hover over here, nasty bit, nasty bit. For Marty, it was one of those Chia Pet things, everything was already grown for him.\nAnderson: I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like when we have to go to work again without him. It\u2019s going to be a big gaping hole.\nDiCaprio: Chase [Infiniti] was incredible.\nAnderson: Yes, she was.\nDiCaprio: We did an extensive audition process, and there was some point at which you said, \u201cThis is the one.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, this is the one.\u201d And this was her first movie.\nAnderson: We started with filming your scenes with her. I remember thinking, I\u2019m really going to keep an eye on her today; she must be very nervous. And she wasn\u2019t nervous\u2014maybe she was, we all probably were. But the point is, she was so instantly a professional. We shot the final scene at the beginning. I think we all collectively said, \u201cThis will never be in the movie. We\u2019re going to go make the movie, and we\u2019ll come back to this; we\u2019re never going to get anything good here.\u201d And lo and behold, I think we got something quite magical.\nDiCaprio: That final scene\u2014it\u2019s very, very moving. And then Teyana [Taylor] was just absolutely fantastic. What an ability to improv and embody that character.\nAnderson: Teyana was best when you just give her the green light to cut loose. Just let her cook and make sure you\u2019re filming it right. That\u2019s the best way to do that.\nDiCaprio: And Sean, of course.\nAnderson: Sean Penn, I mean, he\u2019s just old enough that, for us starting out, he was this hero. You\u2019re like, Wow, that\u2019s an actor, that\u2019s a man.\nDiCaprio: After knowing him so long, I\u2019m just so happy he got to have a character like this, because it wasn\u2019t going to be the traditional way to play him. You knew Sean was going to bring some element that was askew. I only got to do one scene with him.\nAnderson: It\u2019s just one in the supermarket, right? I will always remember that as a great day, when you kept looking around, asking, \u201cAre we going to close this supermarket down?\u201d Me saying, \u201cNo, we\u2019re just going to shoot.\u201d And then the cashier at the checkout, in the middle of your scene, takes out her phone and starts taking pictures of you. That made me laugh. I guess she got bored taking pictures after a while.\nDiCaprio: Do you like the idea of controlled chaos in what you do?\nAnderson: Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good all the time. You have to pick and choose when you think it\u2019ll be appropriate. There are certain moments when you\u2019re like, I want to feel the unknown entering. We shot a scene in Punch-Drunk Love of Adam Sandler on a telephone calling Emily Watson in a hotel room. He\u2019s standing in a street in Honolulu, and he calls her, and it\u2019s fantastic. But when we were standing there, I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s good, but it\u2019s a little low energy, and I don\u2019t really know what else I would do to fix it.\u201d As we were wrapping up for the day, someone said, \u201cYou can\u2019t leave your truck here\u2014tomorrow is this huge Japanese American Parade day.\u201d And of course we say, \u201cWait a minute, there\u2019s a parade going on? We could put the phone booth right there and shoot in the middle of a parade? Let\u2019s come back.\u201d That was the kind of thing where there\u2019s something larger happening than your film. Sometimes you\u2019re going to fail. But there are other times where you can catch lightning in a bottle. Adam was supposed to get quite angry at his sister on one of these phone calls, and he was kind of getting there, but not really. These drummers are coming down the road making this tribal banging at the same time he\u2019s supposed to reach this peak. The music had to affect him. He fucking launches into this fantastic take of anger; he\u2019s lost his mind.\nDiCaprio: It\u2019s the \u201cI\u2019m walking here!\u201d moment, right?\nAnderson: That\u2019s right. We got quite lucky with some of that stuff on this film. We shot underneath a freeway underpass, forty feet from the border of Tijuana, while we were raiding the immigration camp. I couldn\u2019t tell the real immigrants who were sneaking across the border from the background artists that we\u2019d hired. No one could. I\u2019d watch them walk in the back of a scene and think, Is that a background cross or is that somebody really crossing? And it would be people that were really crossing the border.\nDiCaprio: Tell me about the line from Benicio\u2019s character. About freedom.\nAnderson: It\u2019s a Nina Simone line. An interviewer asks, \u201cWhat is freedom to you?\u201d And she says, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what freedom is. No fear. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d That wasn\u2019t in the script, but the deeper we got into shooting, that kept reverberating in my mind. Don\u2019t be afraid. Keep going. It became perfect to throw it into Benicio\u2019s mouth. And as a philosophy, it certainly holds true for me. Freedom is no fear. Let\u2019s hope we can all get there.\nDiCaprio: What do you make of the state of the movie business today?\nAnderson: I\u2019m just trying to rapidly live in reverse to hold on to any shred of the Olden Times that\u2019s left. This is called denial and nostalgia\u2014wish me luck. I\u2019m only half kidding. The irony is that the best part of life is the constant forward momentum. It only moves in one direction, so hop on and hold tight. Every \u201csky is falling\u201d panic has been screamed and screamed again. Best to remain calm, keep your head down, and dedicate yourself to the work at hand. The rest is just noise. I love our business, and I\u2019ve seen it flourish and eat itself and then turn around and grow strong and then make the same mistakes it made years earlier. Through it all, it\u2019s still standing. Or in other words, \u201cYou never got me down, Ray.\u201d\nDiCaprio: Raging Bull.\nAnderson: This is not me talking; this is Esquire. \u201cYou give so much to every role you play, once filming wraps, what do you do to come down from it?\u201d\nDiCaprio: Sheesh.\nAnderson: How do you recover? What is what? What does a jet-setter like yourself do?\nDiCaprio: Ironic, because I\u2019m on a yacht off Croatia right now.\nAnderson: I\u2019d expect nothing less. I\u2019ll rephrase the question: Do you get the blues after filming? Because I sure do. How do you avoid it?\nDiCaprio: I think I\u2019m good at it because I take a lot of time off between films. I do things more sparingly, which means you\u2019re anxious to get back to your real life once you\u2019ve finished filming. Life goes on hold when you\u2019re filming. Everything stops and gets put on the back burner in your real life. I might be more concerned if I worked too much. To go from film to film, I would be scared about what do I have to come back to? I\u2019m very fortunate for that.\nAnderson: That makes sense. Sometimes when a film starts, it\u2019s very hard to get used to how little structure there is. How far from normal it is. The lack of sleep, the circus lifestyle of it all. And then, when it\u2019s over, a hundred days later, it\u2019s very challenging to return to the structure of everyday life.\nDiCaprio: It\u2019s much more difficult for directors, in my mind. We get to go home and bounce back into our normal rhythm and in a much different way until promotion time.\nAnderson: Which leads me into the next question, which Esquire wants me to ask: \u201cWhat do you worry about? What keeps you up at night?\u201d Besides saying dumb shit while you\u2019re promoting your movie. You know what, don\u2019t answer that.\nPhotographed by Paul Thomas Anderson\nStyled by Warren Alfie Baker\nGrooming by Kara Yoshimoto Bua using Chanel Beauty for A-Frame Agency\nTailoring by Suzy Yun\nProduction by Jill Roy at 3Star Productions\nDirector of Photography: Pearl Minnie Anderson\nVideo Editor: Sam Miller\nEsquire Editor in Chief: Michael Sebastian\nEsquire Senior Entertainment Director: Andrea Cutler\nEsquire Visual Director: James Morris\nEsquire Design Director: Martin Hoops"

I\u2019m so vain for no reason. No one has ever gone to a Kathy Griffin show to see her beautiful, youthful face. You come to hear my jokes, which is what I want.\u201d\nThe two-time Emmy Award winner joked that she told doctors she wanted a \u201cgood, healthy [face] yank\u201d to remove wrinkles so she wouldn\u2019t have to return in \u201csix months.\u201d\nThe \u201cMy Life on the D-List\u201d personality shared that doctors also gave her an eyelid plasty and performed work on her chin.\nShe admitted that the surgery was not easy to recover from.\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cSo these b\u2013ches that are like \u2018it\u2019s like getting a tooth filled, it\u2019s nothing!\u2019 No, it\u2019s painful.\u201d\nThe former reality star started undergoing facial transformations in her 20s, which included getting a nose job at 26.\nThe \u201cSuddenly Susan\u201d alum\u2019s recent glow-up is a stark contrast from her appearance in July of last year, when she was spotted looking nearly unrecognizable during an outing near her Malibu home.\nThe star looked very different as she wore a white shirt from her 2018 \u201cLaugh Your Head Off World Tour\u201d and bared her forehead in the sun.\nThe \u201cDilbert\u201d voice star confessed that her natural hair is \u201cwiry and curly,\u201d and she often has \u201cmagic\u201d hair, in the form of wigs, that help her achieve her well-known look.\nGriffin has admitted to using wigs publicly ever since she shaved her head in August 2017 to stand in solidarity with her sister, Joyce, who was undergoing chemotherapy at the time."

It feels like an overused word, but it is the correct word. He was a devoted father. His four children were and will always be his greatest love and his greatest legacy,\u201d the obituary continued.\n\u201cHe was the son, brother, father, friend, and love you prayed to have in your life,\u201d it added. \u201cAbove all, he was a dreamer.\u201d\nBesides River and Remington, Blackstock shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18, with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth, who, like Clarkson, was not mentioned in the obit.\nJones was previously married to Greg Goose LaPoint, according to wedding photos on her Facebook page dated September 2021.
