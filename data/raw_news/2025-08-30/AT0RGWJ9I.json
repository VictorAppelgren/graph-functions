The policy went into effect Aug. 1 and applies to all school events, booster clubs and outside groups using district facilities.\n\nHouse-Gregory and some residents, including former Pace football coach Kent Smith, asked Santa Rosa School Board members to reconsider the decision at the Aug. 7 meeting, without success.\n\nThe Santa Rosa County Board of Commissioners saved the day, however, by approving House-Gregory\u2019s request to use county land with a holding pond near the Pace Library for the fireworks show.\n\nThat same night, House-Gregory shot off fireworks during the Patriots Kickoff Classic.\n\n\u201cThe moment the first fireworks went off, the crowd erupted in cheers. It was fantastic. They loved them,\u201d House-Gregory recalled.\n\nOn Friday morning, Aug. 29, he said he expected even more excitement at the first home game of the season that night \u2013 especially since the Patriots were playing the Crusaders, longtime rivals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big crowd tonight. In the past, this game has always drawn a lot of fans who love the Patriots and seeing the fireworks,\u201d Foster said.\n\nThe display is sponsored by Pace High\u2019s supporting organizations such as the Quarterback Club, which pays $4,000 to $5,000 for the fireworks each year.\n\nHouse-Gregory, who has been managing the fireworks for the past six years, said the community was extremely supportive of his efforts.\n\n\u201cWe received numerous calls from parents, students and businesses thanking us for staying true to this tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot thank the Santa Rosa County commissioners enough for allowing us to continue the fireworks tradition.\u201d\n\nThe school district said the decision to not allow fireworks or pyrotechnics was made in coordination with local fire officials and is based on National Fire Protection Association codes, state legislation, Florida School Board Insurance Trust liability concerns, and the lack of proper safety setbacks on school campuses.\n\nAlexandra Timmons, the district\u2019s director of risk management, said the recommendation to change the policy was not made in haste and was an objective one regarding risk and liability exposure.\n\n\u201cOur Florida School Boards Insurance Trust is to prohibit (fireworks). They are not an exclusion, but their recommendation is to prohibit them. There\u2019s great exposure to injury and we would assume a lot of that liability,\u201d she told board members. \u201cOur member districts in the trust do not allow fireworks and as a member of that insurance pool, we have a responsibility to mitigate the risks within our district because any claims that come to us, obviously, are part of that entire claims factor when they are looking for reinsurance.\u201d\n\nTimmons said even if a vendor provides appropriate liability insurance coverage and lists the school district as an additional insurant and certificate holder, the Santa Rosa School District could still be a named party in litigation.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pensacola News Journal: Pace High School football game fireworks will continue",

  "summary": "The tradition of fireworks at Pace High football games, which began 31 years ago, was temporarily halted when Santa Rosa County District Schools decided to prohibit them due to concerns about liability. The policy, which went into effect on August 1, applies to all school events, booster clubs, and outside groups using district facilities. Steve House-Gregory, who manages the fireworks, was allowed to use county-owned land near the school where fans could still see the display. The Santa Rosa county Board of Commissioners approved House's request to use this land for the fireworks show. The district's director of risk management, Alexandra Timmons, stated that the policy was not made haste and was an objective one regarding risk and liability exposure.",
