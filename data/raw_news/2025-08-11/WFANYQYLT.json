  "title": "Sophie Turner fires back at social media critic who said she's 'forgotten' about children",
  "description": "Sophie Turner is defending her parenting on social media after a commenter criticized the actress for sharing a post that didn't feature her children.",
  "content": "The British actress, who shares daughters Willa and Delphine with ex-husband Joe Jonas, defended her parenting on social media after an Instagram user criticized her Aug. 4 post for not featuring her children, who are 5 and 3, respectively.\n\nThe lighthearted post featured several clips of Turner, 29, and friend Ellie Wasserberg attending a concert from rock band Oasis, which kicked off its highly anticipated comeback tour in July. For her concert attire, the \"Game of Thrones\" alum was seen decked out in tour merch that included a baby blue Oasis band tee and beige bucket hat.\n\n\"Bucket hats & beers\u2026. That'll do me,\" Turner captioned the post.\n\nHowever, one fan was not amused by Turner's non-parenting fun. User @elizabethwakes96 wrote: \"I think she has forgotten that she has two kids.\"\n\nTurner and Jonas, 35, split in September 2023 after the Jonas Brothers singer filed to dissolve their marriage, claiming that the couple's relationship had become \"irretrievably broken.\" Amid their divorce, Turner sued Jonas for allegedly withholding their children's passports and refusing to allow them to return to England (lawyers for both Jonas and Turner later requested that a judge dismiss the federal lawsuit, effectively terminating Turner's case).\n\nTurner, who has been open about the emotional difficulties of coparenting, responded to the criticism in a fiery Aug. 7 comment.\n\n\"Ah I'm so sorry, sometimes I forget some people can't think for themselves,\" wrote Turner in a mocking tone. \"So\u2026. Get this\u2026.There's this crazy thing called shared custody. Maybe, just maybe, they were with their dad that day.\"\n\nIn an October 2024 interview with Harper's Bazaar U.K., Turner reflected on the isolation of coparenting, describing the periods without her children as \"absolute agony.\"\n\n\"I want them to see me having a social life and enjoying work and thriving in my career and relationships. I want them to see a hard-working mum,\" Turner said. \"I'll come back and say, 'This is why Mummy was away \u2014 it's because she's doing this for you, so Father Christmas can come with a big bundle of presents.'\"\n\nDespite the initial flak Turner received for her concert post, many users came to the actress's defense in the comments section.\n\n\"Is it that incomprehensible to you that her children might have other trusted caregivers aside from her? The dad perhaps?\" @laura_kai_02 wrote. \"Is it that strange to you that a dad look after his own children every now and again?\"\n\n\"Just because you are a parent doesn't me you don't exist as a person,\" @emmiejack0810 wrote. \"You are still you, and you still need you time. Rock on girl!!!!!\"",

      "text": "Sophie Turner, Joe Jonas reach temporary custody agreement for daughters amid divorce\nSophie Turner and Joe Jonas reached a temporary agreement regarding sharing custody of their two daughters after the \"Game of Thrones\" star petitioned for the return of their children back to England.\nAccording to a second interim consent order filed Tuesday, Turner and Jonas will each have custody of their daughters, ages 3 and 1, for alternating periods ranging from 1\u00bd to three weeks through Jan. 7, per a court document obtained by USA TODAY.\nTurner will have custody of their daughters Oct. 9 through Oct. 21 and they will then be in Jonas' custody starting Oct. 21 until Nov. 2. The children will spend Thanksgiving with Jonas and Christmas and New Year's with Turner. Each parent is able to temporarily travel with their children to the United Kingdom or any U.S. state during their allotted time.\nThe estranged couple has until Dec. 23 to share an update on their plans following the interim consent order.\nJoe Jonas, Sophie Turner's discussions about custody are 'productive'\nAccording to the judge's filing on Tuesday, Jonas and Turner \"are engaged in mediation with United States and United Kingdom co-mediators.\" Third-party mediators help parents reach an agreement on how children spend time with their parents through determining custody and visitation.\n\"Due to the ongoing and productive nature of mediation, (Turner and Jonas) jointly request entry of this Second Interim Consent Order in anticipation of an amicable resolution of all issues being reached,\" according to the filing.\nThis temporary arrangement doesn't mean the judge has made a decision regarding Turner's Sept. 21 petition for returning the children to England. However, the order does supersede the previous Sept. 25 interim consent order in which the two agreed to not travel outside of New York with their children.\n'A united decision': Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner confirm they're divorcing after four years\nTemporary custody schedule comes after Sophie Turner claimed Joe Jonas refused to return daughters to England\nTuesday's development comes more than two weeks after Turner filed a lawsuit against Jonas for allegedly refusing to return their children to England amid their high-profile divorce.\nTurner claimed that though the children were supposed to be returned to her on Sept. 20 so they could travel to England, Jonas withheld their daughters' passports and \"refuses to send the children home to England.\"\nIn a Sept. 21 statement to USA TODAY, a representative for Jonas, Jeff Raymond, disputed Turney's claim and said the former couple's daughters \"were not abducted\" by their father.\n\"After being in Joe's care for the past three months at the agreement of both parties, the children are currently with their mother,\" the rep said. \"Sophie is making this claim only to move the divorce proceedings to the UK and to remove the children from the U.S. permanently.\"\nTurner's petition was filed Sept. 21 under The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, both of which provide solutions for children internationally abducted from one parent.\nTurner stated in her filing that she planned to file a case in England. Jonas' custody of their children is a \"breach\" of Turner's \"rights of custody under English law, England being the children\u2019s habitual residence,\" according to her lawsuit.\nSophie Turner, Joe Jonas are having a messy divorce. But not all celebrities are\nSophie Turner, Joe Jonas offer conflicting reports on whether children lived in the US or UK\nJonas filed for divorce from Turner in Miami-Dade County court on Sept. 5.\nIn the petition, Jonas claimed the children had been living with Jonas in Miami, Florida, \"and other locations throughout the United States.\"\nMeanwhile, Turner said in her lawsuit filed in New York that their daughters have lived in England since April 10. That month, she and Jonas \"made England their permanent home,\" the filing says.\nTurner's suit gives insight into the couple's split, claiming \"the breakdown of the parties' marriage happened very suddenly,\" alleging an \"argument\" on Aug. 15 that preceded Jonas' divorce filing in early September.\nTurner \"found out through the media that the Father had filed for divorce,\" according to her petition.\nContributing: Naledi Ushe, USA TODAY\nGirls' night: Sophie Turner, Taylor Swift step out amid actress' divorce from Joe Jonas"

      "text": "How 'Game of Thrones' went from everyday fantasy to a bonafide phenomenon\nOnce upon a time, all the way back in 2011, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was not \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d we know today.\nIt's hard to remember now, on the eve of the HBO series' highly anticipated eighth and final season arriving April 14, but it wasn't always this big a deal. When the fantasy series debuted, it wasn\u2019t the buzziest show of the year. It didn\u2019t win best drama at the Emmys. It didn\u2019t prompt a thousand think pieces. Its budget didn\u2019t rival those of Marvel films. It had good reviews \u2013 garnering an 80% score on the Metacritic aggregation site \u2013 and good ratings, averaging 2.2 million viewers for the premiere episode. But it didn't have all glowing reviews, or amazing ratings. It was, all in all, just fine.\nSign up for our \"Game of Thrones\" newsletter now\nHow did we get from a modest first season, in which events too expensive to film happened offscreen, to a world in which \u201cThrones\u201d became one of the biggest pop-culture events of the decade?\nOver the past eight years, the sword and sorcery epic about warring kings and frozen undead monsters conquered television. Its slow rise to dominance was unique, helped by plot twists, bloody character deaths, controversy and awards. It did so in the same manner its surviving characters have conquered (or tried to conquer) the fictional realm of Westeros: With violence, surprise, luck and mistakes.\nWatching the first few episodes again today is shocking for the lower quality of its special effects, the endless exposition and plodding storylines. It didn't earn its reputation for great action, magic and ruthless violence right away. By the middle of that first 10-episode season, the series came into its own creatively, just in time for the writers to pull off the first big twist of George R.R. Martin's novels.\nThe idea that any character could die at any time was what made \"Thrones\" stand out, and the first victim was de facto protagonist Ned Stark, played by the series\u2019 biggest star, Sean Bean, who was beheaded in the ninth episode, surprising viewers who hadn't read the books. But the real moment \u201cThrones\u201d transitioned from a show loved by fantasy fans to one that enthralled a broad audience was the infamous Red Wedding.\nMore: HBO will soon have far more shows, but just one potential \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 prequel\nIt was a massive event, a turning point in the show that helped establish the series\u2019 creative sensibility. It was an effective scene not simply because it was violent and astonishing; it was also a grotesquely, beautifully written, acted and directed sequence.\nIf you are unfamiliar with those fateful minutes at the end of the third-season episode, they depicted the murders of Robb and Catelyn Stark (Richard Madden and Michelle Fairley) and Robb\u2019s pregnant wife Talisa (Oona Chaplin), the result of a betrayal by characters we thought we knew. The violence in the sequence, in which Talisa was stabbed repeatedly in her pregnant belly and Catelyn\u2019s throat was sliced ear to ear, was horrific. It tipped the scales in the throne game toward the Lannisters and left the Starks, who should be the victors given their general goodness, with no leader or army.\nAfter the Red Wedding, deaths, blood and shocks became routine. The evil King Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) died at his own wedding in Season 4. Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal) was killed in the series\u2019 most graphic sequence, involving head-crushing, that same year. In Season 6, Cersei (Lena Headey) blew up a temple full of her enemies \u2013 and hundreds of innocent bystanders.\nBut it wasn\u2019t death and destruction that propelled \u201cThrones.\u201d Starting in Season 4, critics and fans began complaining about the series\u2019 use of violence against women, including rape scenes that were not in Martin's novels.\nSex, nudity and sexual violence had been a part of \u201cThrones\u201d from its very first episode, but two sequences drew criticism: Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) raping his sister Cersei in Season 4 and Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) raping Sansa (Sophie Turner) in Season 5. After the Sansa scene, some fans declared that they were done with the series forever.\nBut in some ways, the controversy around the sexual violence only served to heighten the awareness and interest in the series, as controversy often does. But fortunately, the series has shifted gears, deepening its female characters and cutting back on those criticized rape scenes.\nMore: Kit Harington on grueling last 'Game of Thrones' season: 'Everyone was broken at the end'\nBy the time it entered its sixth season in 2016, \"Thrones\" had become a true phenomenon. Fresh off its first Emmy win as outstanding drama (for Season 5, arguably its worst), the series bounced back from a minor ratings dip, resurrected fan favorite Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and finally brought its disparate characters together in highly anticipated reunions. The ratings keep growing: The show's most recent episode, 2017\u2019s Season 7 finale, marked a series high, with 12.1 million same-day viewers, and plenty more afterward.\nWhen you think about the biggest TV shows of the past, you can usually remember a moment when they crystallized into a hit. \u201cSurvivor\u201d blasted out of the gate with huge ratings. \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d won the \u201cNetflix effect,\u201d as TV ratings soared once early seasons appeared on the streaming service. \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\" well, blew up when it put a bomb in a body after the Super Bowl.\n\"Thrones\" has had its big moment over and over again, enjoying exceptional growth at a time when TV viewership is declining almost everywhere else. The confluence of events that led to its small-screen dominance may never happen again. When it ends May 19, can any new series claim its throne?"

      "text": "Sophie Turner had a 'beautiful relationship' with Joe Jonas, is 'very happy' with new beau\nA month out from her divorce from Joe Jonas being finalized, \"Game of Thrones\" star Sophie Turner is moving on with her life.\nIn an interview with Harper's Bazaar U.K. that published Wednesday, the 28-year-old actor reflected on the emotional tool of her yearlong, high-profile divorce from the Jonas Brothers singer.\n\"I'm going through a legal process right now where I can't really say much, but it was incredibly sad. We had a beautiful relationship, and it was hard,\" Turner said. Though it's unclear when the interview took place, her and Jonas' divorce was finalized in Florida on Sept. 6, almost exactly a year after Jonas filed a petition for dissolution of marriage due to an \"irretrievably broken\" marriage.\nThe details of their divorce have not been made public. Earlier this year, the two stars came to a shared custody agreement, according to court filings reviewed by USA TODAY, following an initial custody battle that Turner took to court last fall and dismissed in January. She and Jonas have said their children \u2013 4-year-old Willa and 2-year-old Delphine \u2013 \"will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the U.K.\"\nSophie Turner is 'so happy' to be back in the UK after 6 years in the US\nTurner, who starred in the British TV series \"Joan\" that aired its finale earlier this month, opened up about how healing it has been to be back in the U.K. full-time after starting and raising her family in the U.S., where Jonas was born. Their family lived in Los Angeles and Miami, but Turner experienced homesickness.\n\"I'm so happy to be back. It felt as if my life was on pause until I returned to England,\" she said. \"I just never really feel like myself when I'm not in London, with my friends and family. I was away for so long \u2013 six years \u2013 and it was when my friends were getting engaged, and when I got pregnant. I went for dinner with someone the other day, and she said, 'I never got to touch your belly.' We didn't have those key experiences with each other.\"\nShe also said she found issues such as gun violence and Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022 made it difficult for her to remain in the U.S.\nAnother \"cathartic\" experience amid Turner's divorce was filming an upcoming psychological thriller titled \"Trust.\" In the Carlson Young-directed movie, Turner reportedly plays a Hollywood star who must evade criminals after isolating amid a highly publicized scandal.\n\"That one really mirrored my life from this past year, and it was a very cathartic experience for me,\" she said. \"It was a chance to let out some serious anger, which was fun. So that felt right for me to do.\"\nSophie Turner says it's 'absolute agony' when she's not with her kids\nSharing custody over her two daughters means Turner often has periods without seeing them \u2014 an experience that she describes as \"absolute agony.\" While flying solo, at the time of the Harper's Bazaar interview, she stayed at her friend's west London home so she wouldn't be alone.\nBecoming a mother \"changed me so much in every way. Before I had kids, I was very depressed and anxious, and I would isolate (myself) a lot. Now, I think I live my life for them,\" Turner said.\n\"I want them to see me having a social life and enjoying work and thriving in my career and relationships. I want them to see a hard-working mum,\" Turner added. \"I'll come back and say, 'This is why Mummy was away \u2013 it's because she's doing this for you, so Father Christmas can come with a big bundle of presents.'\"\nTurner, who developed an eating disorder due to the pressures she faced as a child star growing up on the set of \"Game of Thrones,\" also said part of her parenting involves instilling healthy habits in her children.\n\"The great thing about being a mother is that I get to teach my kids how to have a healthy relationship with their bodies, which feels like a justice to myself,\" she said.\nSophie Turner admits relationship with Peregrine Pearson happened 'very quickly'\nBeing back in her homeland isn't the only thing lifting Turner's spirits after her divorce.\n\"We're very happy,\" she said when asked about Peregrine Pearson, a British aristocrat she's been linked to since October 2023. She went Instagram official with him in January.\n\"It came around very quickly. I just needed to go on a date to know how to do it again. That was the first date and the last date, and it's been great,\" Turner said. \"He's lovely. He's funny, and he brings out the cheeky side of me, the fun side. He lights me back up.\"\nOn Sunday, she dedicated an 11-slide Instagram post to her \"angel pie\" boyfriend on his 30th birthday. A few days later, she appeared to chastise people who made judgments in the comments.\n\"Hey guys, I would love if there was no hate towards ANYONE in these comment sections. Love you \ud83d\ude18,\" Turner commented."
