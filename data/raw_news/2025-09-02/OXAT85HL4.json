OPENAI WAS A CLIENT -- IS A CLIENT, INCLUDING RATT GAMES, ELECTRONIC ARTS, MICROSOFT AS CLIENTS. BLOOMBERG IS A CLIENT AS WELL. CAROL: STUFF CERTAINLY CONTINUING IN THE AI SPACE. WE WILL FOCUS ON THAT BUT OUR FOCUS FOR TODAY IS SEPTEMBER AND ALL THAT IS COMING AT GLOBAL INVESTORS, INCLUDING USE THAT BROKE FRIDAY. A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S GLOBAL TARAFFS WERE ISSUED ILLEGALLY UNDER AN EMERGENCY LOT OF HOLDING A RULING BY THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE. THAT ACTION EXTENDING THE CHAOS IN GLOBAL TRADE. WE WANT TO KNOW HOW STRONG AN ACTION THIS IS LEGALLY AND COULD IT UNDO TARAFF ACTIONS AND WHAT IS IT MEAN FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S WATCHING INVESTORS IN THE FED THAT IS WATCHING -- WATCHING, INVESTORS AND THE FED THAT IS WATCHING? WE WILL GET THE LATEST ON LISA COOK AND THE LEGAL FIGHT SHE'S HAVING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. ERIC LARSON IN THE HOUSE. AND MICHAEL HERE IN STUDIO. ERIC, THE RULING ON THE GLOBAL TARIFFS. EXPLAIN THE CASE, THE SIGNIFICANCE. ERIC: DEFINITELY A BIG DEAL. WE WEREN'T NECESSARILY EXPECTING IT FRIDAY NIGHT. IT UPHELD THE RULING FROM MAY OF THE U.S. TRADE COURT FINDING TRUMP ISSUED THE TARAFFS ILLEGALLY, THE LIBERATION DAY TARAFFS. THEY WERE ISSUED UNDER AN EMERGENCY LAW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN USED IN THAT MANNER BEFORE. THE MAJORITY OF THE APPEALS COURT SAID FLAT OUT THAT IS NOT WHY CONGRESS PASSED THAT LAW, THEREFORE THIS IS ILLEGAL. THEY SAID WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DELAY OR PAUSE THE STAY OF THE RULING UNTIL IT GOES TO THE SUPREME COURT POTENTIALLY. RIGHT NOW THE TARIFFS REMAIN IN EFFECT. ONCE AGAIN, JUDGES HELD THEY WERE ISSUED ILLEGALLY. TIM: MIKE MCKEE, YOU HAVE NOT GOTTEN CALLS FOR REFUND YET ON TARIFFS? MICHAEL: INTERESTING QUESTION OF HOW THAT WOULD BE DONE. TIM: IT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION. MICHAEL: WHAT WOULD -- ONE WOULD PRESUME THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO REFUND ALL THE TARAFFS COLLECTED, IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY GO BACK TO THE IMPORTERS OF RECORD THAT PAID IT. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ARGUING MOST OF THIS IS BEING PAID BY OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE BEEN PAYING IT. HOW MUCH HAVE YOU PAID THAT YOU SHOULD GET YOUR MONEY BACK? THAT IS SOMETHING I AM SURE WILL BE THOUGHT ABOUT IN THE COURTS AS WELL. THEY HAVE TO SET UP A SYSTEM PRESUMING TRUMP GOES ON TO THE OTHER TARAFF POSSIBILITIES HE HAS TO COLLECT THOSE TARAFFS. I'M SURE THERE WILL BE LAWSUITS FILED ON THOSE. THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM BEING DONE. CAROL: WHAT IS THE NEXT LEGAL ACTION AND HOW LIKELY IS IT IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE UNTHINKABLE CONTINUES TO HAPPEN? THE LOGICAL DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAPPEN. WALK US THROUGH THAT. ERIC: WE CAN EXPECT THAT TRUMBULL ASKED THE SUPREME COURT TO TAKE THE CASE. THEY PROBABLY WILL AGREE TO DO SO. BOTH SIDES WILL COME TO THE COURT AND SAY THEY WILL SUFFER MORE HARM FROM THIS ILLEGAL ACT. YOU CAN EXPECT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD SAY THESE TARIFFS ARE IN PLACE. HOW CAN YOU UNDO THEM NOW? WE ARE COLLECTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THEM. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRADE DEALS. THAT IS SAYING IT IS TOO LATE. WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE TARIFFS BECAUSE IT IS DONE. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE CASE, A GROUP OF DEMOCRATIC LED STATES AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO SAY I'M SORRY, YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT GOING INTO IT AND YOU KNEW THEY WERE ILLEGAL IN THE TRADE COURT SAID SO. YOU CREATED A MASS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF WITH THESE REFUNDS AS WE DISCUSSED. CAROL: WITH THIS SUPREME COURT, SHOULD WE ASSUME THIS IS A COURT THAT SEEMS HEAVILY STACKED IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAVOR? SHOULD WE ASSUME? ERIC: WE NEVER WANT TO ASSUME BECAUSE HE HAS A MAJORITY THAT HAS WILL CONSISTENTLY IN HIS FAVOR, EVEN IN TIMES ON A LOT OF LEGAL EXPERTS WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THEM NOT TO BASED ON PRECEDENT AND THE CONSTITUTION, SURE, IT COULD GO EITHER WAY. CAROL: TIM IS LAUGHING. MICHAEL: I HAVE SEEN LEGAL ANALYSTS AND SCHOLARS RIGHT THIS WEEKEND THEY SHOULD BE A SLAMDUNK CASE AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT GIVES HIM TARIFF POWER AND THE NONDELEGATION CLAUSE FROM CONGRESS. IT SEEMS TO LAW PROFESSORS IT IS VERY WEIRD THE COURT COULD DO THE OPPOSITE, BUT NOBODY THINKS THAT IS POSSIBLE -- THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. TIM: IS A BACKUP PLAN IT COMES TO IMPLEMENT THINK TARIFFS? MICHAEL: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TARIFF AUTHORITIES HE CAN USE, SOME OF WHICH HE IS USED TO PUT ON THE TARIFF ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM AND AUTOS. THERE ARE TARIFF HE CAN PUT ON FOR NATIONAL SECURITY PURPOSES. THERE HAS TO BE A FINDING THERE IS A NATIONAL SECURITY NEED. TIM: AND THERE IS AN EXPIRATION DATE. MICHAEL: THE ONE PEOPLE .2 IS A SECTION OF THE TARIFF LAW THAT ALLOWS THEM TO PUT ON TARIFFS IF THERE IS A SITUATION WHERE THE UNITED STATES IS SUFFERING FROM UNFAIR TRADE THAT LASTS FOR 150 DAYS. THEY CAN PUT 15% TARIFFS ON. THAT COULD BE A BRIDGE TO WHATEVER THEY END UP DOING. THAT IS THE UNIVERSAL ONE. A LOT OF THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE COUNTRY BY COUNTRY, WHICH WOULD TAKE UP SOME TIME TO GET THE REPORTS DONE AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THEM AND WHAT LEVEL OF TARIFF YOU WILL PUT ON. CAROL: I WANT TO SPEND A MINUTE ON LISA COOK. ERICA, WHAT IS NEXT IN THAT LEGAL BATTLE YOU THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ON OUR RADAR? THIS IS THE FED GOVERNOR PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS FIRED AND LISA COOK HAS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. ERIC: THERE WAS A HEARING ON FRIDAY MORNING. THERE WAS NO RULING. WE ARE WAITING FOR A RULING ON WHETHER OR NOT SHE CAN STAY IN HER JOB WHILE THE CASE PROCEEDS. EITHER A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER THAT WOULD KEEP HER IN HER JOB FOR A FEW WEEKS OR MORE, OR A LONGER-LASTING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION THAT WILL LAST FOR THE REST OF THE CASE. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHICH TYPE OF RULING THE JUDGE WILL ISSUE. THERE MIGHT BE NEGOTIATIONS BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WILL PREVENT THE NEED FOR AN EMERGENCY TRO. WE ARE GOING TO GET ANOTHER FILING FROM COOK TODAY, THIS AFTERNOON POTENTIALLY. WE MIGHT GET ANOTHER RESPONSE FROM TRUMP'S SIDE. IT COULD BE DAYS BEFORE WE GET A ROOM. MICHAEL: THIS JUST INTO THE EYEWITNESS NEWS NETWORK. WHILE YOU WERE TALKING I GOT AN EMAIL FROM YOUR EDITOR. ERIC: IT SAYS SEPTEMBER 4. MICHAEL: THE FILING FROM THE COOK SIDE IS IN. APPARENTLY THE LAWYERS FOR COOK ONE PERMISSION TO FILE A LONGER BRIEF. THEY HAVE ASKED FOR FRIDAY. ACTUALLY, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 4. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT OPPOSE THAT. NO RULING BEFORE SEPTEMBER 4. THE QUESTION IS, UNTIL SUCH TIME ISSUE EMPLOYED OR NOT? WE DON'T SEEM TO KNOW. ERIC: IT IS POSSIBLE THEY MIGHT TELL THE JUDGE THEY HAVE COME TO AN AGREEMENT ABOUT HER STAYING IN HER JOB UNTIL THERE IS A RULING THAT WE DON'T KNOW YET. CAROL: JUST A THOUGHT. CROSSING SOME THINGS ALL THE UNCERTAINTY LIST. YOU GUYS ROCK. DEREK LARSON AND ECONOMICS AND POLICY CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL MCKEE. SOME OF THE ISSUES COMING AT INVESTORS THIS MONTH. TIM: WE WILL STAY ON HOW THAT SHOULD BE OR COULD BE IMPACTING THOSE AND HOW INVESTORS MAKE DECISIONS OR PUT OFF THOSE DECISIONS. HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE CONFIDENCE MAP CHARTING A PATH, A BOOK THAT DIGS DEEP WHEN IT COMES TO DECISION-MAKING. CAROL: A FRIEND OF THE PROGRAM, PETER ATWATER FROM THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. PETER, GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE FIRST TRADING DAY OF SEPTEMBER. SUMMER IS OVER. WE ALWAYS FEEL A MOOD SHIFT. ANY REASON TO THINK THIS MONTH WILL ALSO POTENTIALLY BE PROBLEMATIC FOR INVESTORS? IS IT A DIFFERENT SEPTEMBER THIS TIME AROUND? PETER: THANKS FOR LETTING ME BE HERE TODAY. I DO THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY CHALLENGING SEPTEMBER. SEVERAL THINGS ON MY RADAR SCREEN. I'M WATCHING EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN YIELDS AND TODAY WE HAVE SEEN A CLEAR LINKAGE BETWEEN HIGHER YIELDS AND LOWER EQUITY MARKETS. IF THAT NARRATIVE CONTINUES, THAT COULD BE QUITE A MOMENT FOR THE STOCK MARKET. POLITICALLY, FRANCE, GERMANY, ENGLAND IS A REAL MELTING POT TODAY OF POPULISM. THAT IS FRONT AND CENTER IN MY MIND. CAROL: HOW PROBLEMATIC WOULD GET HER INVESTORS? HOW DO YOU SEE IT PLAYING OUT AND DO YOU ALSO ANTICIPATE -- WE MENTIONED YOUR BOOK GOING INTO THIS. WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS ON TOP OF MIND FOR INVESTORS NOW WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING DECISIONS TO DEPLOY ASSETS OR PULLBACK, WHAT TO DO IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. WE TALKED ABOUT THE TRADE RULING ON TRADE, WHETHER OR NOT ALL OF THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIVING THE LAST FIVE OR SIX MONTHS COMES UNDONE. PETER: WHEN I LOOK AT THE POPULATION TODAY ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE, THERE IS A SENSE OF INVULNERABILITY LIKE I HAVE NOT SEEN. IT MAKES WHAT WE SAW IN 2021 LOOK TIMID. INVESTORS, PARTICULARLY RETAIL INVESTORS BELIEVE THE MARKET IS UNSINKABLE. I SAW SOMEBODY ANALOGIZE IT TO RASPUTIN. THE ON TILLABLE MARKET -- UNKILLABLE MARKET. INVESTORS THINK THEY CAN IGNORE THE GEOPOLITICS AROUND THEM. I DON'T THINK THAT WILL ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE THE CASE. AT THE SAME TIME, I SEE DESPONDENT'S, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE LOW-END CONSUMER. I USED THE TALK ABOUT THE ARMS AND LEGS OF THE K SHAPED ECONOMY. NOW I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT FINGERS AND TOES. THE CLUSTERING HAS BECOME SO EXTREME AT THE VERY TOP AND AT THE VERY BOTTOM. THAT GAP NOW APPEARS TO BE UNPROFITABLE. -- UNC ROSSABLE. SHARED POWERLESSNESS UNITES THE BOTTOM. LAWMAKERS NEED TO BE ATTUNED TO THAT. TIM: WE ARE GETTING HEADLINES FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT NOW. HE IS SPEAKING ON THE SCOTT JENNINGS RADIO SHOW AND SAYS HE WILL APPEAL THE TARIFF RULING. HE REPEATS THAT GLOBAL TARIFFS ARE AN ECONOMIC EMERGENCY AND SAID WE WILL SEE A REVERBERATION IF WE DON'T WIN ON TARIFFS. HOW SHOULD INVESTORS BE THINKING ABOUT THIS? HE TALKED ABOUT CHAOS AND CLARITY. I THINK THERE IS MORE CHAOS WHEN IT COMES TO THE POLICY AS A RESULT OF LEGAL BATTLES, AS A RESULT OF THE BACK-AND-FORTH WITH THESE LAWYERS, WITH THESE RULINGS. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY CLEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING. PETER: NO, IT IS NOT CLEAR. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF VERY ME HERE NOW DECISION-MAKING WE HAVE SEEN ON THE PART OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. I THINK FOR INVESTORS, THEY HAVE PRESUMED WHEN MARKETS DECLINED THE ADMINISTRATION WILL STEP BACK AND PIVOT IN THEIR FAVOR. THE TACO TRADE. WHAT IS BECOMING REALITY IS THOSE WHO ARE RUNNING BUSINESSES -- WE SAW THIS IN THE MANUFACTURING REPORTS EARLIER TODAY, THEY ARE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THE UNCERTAINTY AND POWERLESSNESS THEY FEEL. THE RESULT IN THOSE SITUATIONS, AS YOU WOULD EXPECT, THEY ARE PULLING BACK ON ORDERS. THEY ARE MAKING MORE DELIBERATE EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS. THE REAL ECONOMY I THINK IS DECOUPLING FOR THE MARKETS IN THE MARKETS BELIEVE THEY ULTIMATELY PREVAIL. THE REAL ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO SHOW THEM THAT IS NOT THE CASE. CAROL: WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE PRESIDENT IN TERMS OF WATCHING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND HIS WILLINGNESS OR UNWILLINGNESS TO BACK OFF OF POLICIES THAT UPSET THINGS? WE SAW A 180 WHEN IT CAME TO TARIFFS EARLIER THIS YEAR. HOW DO YOU FACTOR THAT IN NOW? PETER: WHAT I SEE SINCE THEN IS A GROWING SENSE OF INVULNERABILITY. I SEE THAT POLITICALLY, FINANCIALLY, ECONOMICALLY. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SEES ITSELF AND SEES ITS DECISION-MAKING AS JUST IRREPRESSIBLE. ON OPPOSABLE -- UNOPPOSABLE. THAT SUGGESTS A LEVEL OF INSULARITY, ISOLATIONIST THAT IS INCREASINGLY DECOUPLED FROM WHAT WE ARE SEEING ON MAIN STREET. IT IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE PRESIDENT OUT DOING RALLIES IN THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION THE WAY HE DID BEFORE. INSTEAD HE'S VERY ISOLATED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE -- IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND MAR-A-LAGO AND PLACES WHERE -- TIM: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? THE ENERGY OF THE RALLIES WAS SOMETHING THAT A YEAR AGO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT, EVEN UP TO THE ELECTION. HE LIKES TO GO ON TOUR TO CELEBRATE WHAT HE VIEWS AS WINS. WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S BEEN QUITE ABOUT THIS? PETER: MY OWN VIEW WOULD BE THAT HE DOES NOT SEE IT AS NECESSARY AT THIS POINT. HE HAS WON. THERE IS A SENSE THAT SUPPORT IS NO LONGER NEEDED FOR HIM TO BE EFFECTIVE IN HIS ROLE. I THINK THAT IS A CHALLENGE -- WILL BECOME A CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT IS ONE THING TO UNIFY A CROWD AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY, IN THIS CASE FORMER PRESIDENT BIDEN. THE CHALLENGE IS MAINTAINING THAT MOMENTUM AND COHESION POST VICTORY. IT SURPRISES ME THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN HIM OUT THERE TRYING TO SUSTAIN THE CROWD. CAROL: IN THE NEXT SEGMENT WE WILL TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE NEW AXIS OF POWER, CHINA, INDIA AND RUSSIA. I WONDER AS WE TALK ABOUT THE U.S. SEEMINGLY OR ACCURATELY OR ACTUALLY TURNING MORE INWARD AND THE REST OF THE WORLD MOVING ON TO NEW ALLIANCES, WHAT IS THAT MEAN FOR THE U.S. FINANCIAL MARKETS? WHAT IS THAT MEAN FOR U.S. INVESTORS? PETER: I THINK YOU ARE SEEING NOT ONLY THE UNITED STATES TURNING INWARD BUT EUROPE TURNING INWARD. IT TOO IS PULLING BACK. NOT ONLY GLOBALLY BUT AMONG ITSELF. IT IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT WE HAVE A WESTERN WORLD THAT IS INCREASINGLY ISOLATIONIST AT A TIME THAT THE EASTERN WORLD APPEARS TO BE COMING TOGETHER. HAVING SAID THAT, WE ARE TALKING, ABOUT THREE VERY DOMINANT INDEPENDENT NATIONALIST LEADERS WHO TODAY IS VERY CONVENIENT FOR THEM TO CREATE WHAT LOOKS TO BE COHESION AGAINST THE WEST. I WOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THAT OF CONFIDENCE DROPS IN THOSE GEOGRAPHIES THEY WILL BECOME VERY INWARDLY FOCUSED. CAROL: WE ARE TALKING WITH PETER ATWATER AT THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY AND THE AUTHOR OF \"THE CONFIDENCE MAP.\" DO YOU NOT BY WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN ALL THE FOOTAGE, THE HANDSHAKING, THE LAUGHING BETWEEN PRESIDENT PUTIN, XI JINPING AND PRIME MINISTER MODI? IS IT JUST FOR THE CAMERAS? PETER: I DO BUY IT. I BUY IT PARTICULARLY SYMBOLICALLY THAT IT BEHOOVES THEM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE COHESIVE AGAINST THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE MY ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND AND THAT'S ONLY EFFECTIVE SO LONG AS THE THREE OF THEM CONTINUE TO SEE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS THEIR JOINT ADVERSARY. TIM: JUST AN UPDATE FROM YOU ABOUT A QUESTION WE FIRST DISCUSSED IN MARCH WHEN YOU ARE ON THE PROGRAM WHEN WE ASKED IF YOU BELIEVED THE U.S. WOULD BE UNINVESTABLE. I'M CURIOUS IF YOU THINK THE U.S. IS MORE OR LESS UN INVESTABLE THIN IT WAS BACK IN THE SPRING. CAROL: THAT RESPONSE WENT A LITTLE VIRAL. I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU THAT. PETER: YEAH, I DO BELIEVE IT IS MORE UNINVESTABLE TODAY THAN IT WAS BEFORE IN MARCH. MY REASON HAS TO DO WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL DIMINUTION OF SHAREHOLDER PRIVACY WE'VE SEEN. THE NEW ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN PURSUING NATIONALIST ECONOMIC POLICIES. I THINK THAT MAKES THE UNITED STATES PARTICULARLY AT THESE VALUATIONS FAR LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN IT HAD BEEN. CAROL: WE NEED TO RUN. PETER, THANK YOU SO MUCH. BE WELL. PETER ATWATER AT THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. HIS BOOK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ON AIR WITH HIM, \"THE CONFIDENCE MAP.\" TIM: LET'S GET AN UPDATE ON THE TRADE. LISA MATEO IN FOR CHARLIE PELLETT. LISA: WE ARE IN THE RED. WALL STREET KICKING OFF SEPTEMBER TRADING LOWER WITH THE NASDAQ DOWN MORE THAN 1%. SAME FOR THE S & P AND THE DOW. HEADING OVER TO THE TWO-YEAR YIELD, 3.65%. YIELD ON THE 10-YEAR, 4.28%, UP ABOUT FIVE BASIS POINTS. THE DOLLAR SPOT INDEX OF ABOUT HALF OF THE PERCENT. WILL U.S. FACTORY ACTIVITY THAT SHRANK IN AUGUST FOR A SIXTH STRAIGHT MONTH NOW DRIVEN BY PULLBACK IN PRODUCTION OF THE ISM MANUFACTURING INDEX, SLIDING FROM 48 IN JULY. OPENAI AGREED TO BUY PRODUCT TESTING START UP FOR $1.1 BILLION. IT'S AN ALL-STAR DEAL -- ALL STOCK DEAL IN ONE OF THE LARGEST ACQUISITIONS IN THE CHATGPT MAKERS HISTORY. IT LOOKS LIKE CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO SPEND ON JEWELRY. SIGNET JEWELERS LIMITED, THE OWNERS OF ZALES, THEIR SHARES ARE UP MORE THAN 2%. FOR ON-DEMAND NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY'S SUBSCRIBE TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW OR EVER YOU GET YOUR PODCAST. I'M LISA MATEO AND THAT IS THE BLOOMBERG BUSINESS FLASH. CAROL: I'M CAROL MASSAR WITH TIM STENOVEC LIVE ON BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK DAILY. WE SAY THIS A LOT BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY LIVING IN SOME INTERESTING TIMES. TAKE WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY, KIM YEARS DASH CAM WAS CAPTURING XI JINPING IN A HUDDLE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND NARENDRA MODI. TIM: PRESIDENT XI'S MOST POWERFUL PARTNERS RESISTING AMERICA ON THE WORLD STAGE MET AT A SUMMIT IN A CHINESE PORT CITY. PRESIDENT XI HELD THE HAND OF HIS INDIAN COUNTERPART AS THE MEN LAUGHED CASUALLY. IT WAS A STRIKING THANKSGIVING WANT TO OF NEW DELHI AND BEIJING WERE SEEN AS RIVALS. TAKING NOTE OF THE DEEPENING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIA AND CHINA EARLIER ON BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. > > IF YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH INDIA, INDIA DOES NOT WANT TO BE LOOKING AROUND AND SEEN CHINA ON THE LEFT AND PAKISTAN ON THE RIGHT AND BELARUS ACROSS THE ROOM. IT WOULD RATHER BE IN A GROUP OF COUNTRIES THE UNITED STATES AND OTHERS AND STRENGTHENING TRADE RELATIONS THERE. IT WILL PUSH BACK IF IT THINKS IS BEING PUSHED INTO A CORNER. WE ARE SEEING A SITUATION WHERE CHINA IS BECOMING AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW. CAROL: THAT WAS LELAND MILLER FROM CHINA BEIGE BOOK. LET'S GET TO IT AND EXPLAIN OR GET DETAIL ON HOW XI SEES WHAT THE CAMERAS CAPTURED AT THE MEETING OF LEADERS OF CHINA, INDIA AND RUSSIA AND WAS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES. BACK WITH US IS WENDI CUTLER AND JOINS US FROM THE NATION'S CAPITAL. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK WITH TIM AND MYSELF. YOU SPENT THREE DECADES AS A DIPLOMAT NEGOTIATOR IN THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT WAS CAPTURED ON CAMERAS OF THOSE THREE LEADERS, LET'S START THERE AND WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES. WENDY: BIG IMPORTANT WEEK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD. THREE OF THE MOST POWERFUL LEADERS IN THE WORLD REALLY SHOWED AN AFFECTION AND AGREED ON AN AGENDA GOING FORWARD. FOR ME, SEEING MODI AS ONE OF THE THREE LEADERS COMES AS A SURPRISE GIVEN WHERE WE WERE JUST THREE MONTHS AGO WITH INDIA. WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF CONCLUDING ONE OF THE EARLIEST TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH DELHI. THINGS HAVE CHANGED QUICKLY. I'M NOT SAYING MODI IS ALL IN WITH XI JINPING AND BUT HE LOOKED -- PUTIN BUT HE LOOKED COMFORTABLE WITH HIS FELLOW LEADERS. TIM: IS A WAY FOR -- IS THERE A WAY FOR U.S. TO BRING INDIA CLOSER OR WHERE IT WAS THREE MONTHS AGO? LAST WEEK WITH THE 50% TARIFFS, IT WAS A BIG DEAL BETWEEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES. IS THERE A WAY TO GO BACK TO WHERE IT WAS? WENDY: I THINK IT WILL BE HARD TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE THREE MONTHS AGO. I DO THINK WE CAN MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. THE BEST STEP FORWARD WOULD BE TO FIND A WAY TO AGREE ON A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH INDIA. WE GOT VERY CLOSE. THEY WERE VERY FEW ISSUES LEFT, INCLUDING OPENING UP INDIA'S DAIRY MARKET. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS GEOSTRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP I WOULD HOPE WE COULD FIND A WAY FORWARD ON THE TRADE FRONT, ALLOW FOR THE RELAXATION OF THE TARIFFS, AND MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF GETTING THIS RELATIONSHIP BACK ON TRACK. I THINK SOME PERMANENT DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE. CAROL: THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT LEADERS. IT IS NOT MEAN GIRLS THAT DON'T LIKE A GIRL AND THEY ARE GETTING TOGETHER TO TICK SOMEBODY OFF. THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT COUNTRIES. WHAT THEY DO MATTERS. IT IS NOT JUST SOMETHING YOU DO CASUALLY, RIGHT? THIS IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT BEYOND PRESIDENT TRUMP BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WENDY: ABSOLUTELY. IT TOOK US 20 YEARS AND A NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIONS TO WARM RELATIONS WITH INDIA TO THE POINT WE WERE THREE MONTHS AGO. IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO BUILD -- DESTROY RELATIONSHIPS OR HURT THEM VERSUS TO BUILD THEM. THIS IS A BIG SETBACK. THAT SAID, WE SHOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND INDIA AND CHINA, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON BETWEEN THOSE COUNTRIES. WHILE RELATIONS MAY WARM UP, THEY HAVE SERIOUS CHALLENGES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THEIR RELATIONSHIP, INCLUDING A BORDER DISPUTE, A LARGE AND GROWING INDIAN TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA AND THE FACT THAT CHINA IS FLOODING INDIA LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION WITH A LOT OF EXPORTS THAT ARE DISPLACING LOCAL PRODUCTION. I THINK WE JUST NEED TO KIND OF KEEP THIS ALL IN MIND AS WE SIGN OFF, THE UNITED STATES, AND SAY CHINA AND INDIA ARE BEST FRIENDS. EACH OF THOSE LEADERS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. THEY WANTED TO SHOW THE WORLD THEY ARE A GROUP AND WORKING TOGETHER. THEY ARE ALSO VERY SKILLED POLITICIANS AND I THINK THERE WAS A REASON WHY EACH OF THEM WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON IN PARTICULAR THIS WEEKEND. TIM: WE ARE GETTING COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT NOW. NOW, THIS SCOTT JENNINGS SHOW IS PLAYING A RECORDING OF AN INTERVIEW THAT WAS DONE BY THE PRESIDENT RECENTLY. THE PRESIDENT SAYS \"THEY NEVER USE THE MILITARY ON US\" TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA AND CHINA, AND HE IS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT RUSSIAN AND CHINA TIES. SHOULD THE PRESIDENT BE CONCERNED ABOUT RUSSIA AND CHINA TIES? WENDY: EVERY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE CONCERNED. THAT SAID, THESE TIES HAVE BEEN STRONG FOR MANY YEARS AND XI JINPING AND PUTIN HAVE MET CLOSE TO 50 TIMES SINCE BOTH OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE, SO THOSE TIMES WILL CONTINUE TO BE CLOSE. TO SAY THAT WE DON'T CARE OR IS NOT A BIG DEAL, I DON'T REALLY AGREE WITH THAT. I ALSO THINK, FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION, THEY ARE LOOKING TO IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONS NOT ONLY WITH RUSSIA BUT WITH CHINA, AS WELL. IN SOME WAYS, IT IS IN THEIR INTEREST TO NOT LOOK LIKE THEY ARE WORKING AGAINST THOSE TWO COUNTRIES WORKING TOGETHER, BUT TRYING TO BE MORE NONCHALANT ABOUT IT. CAROL: SOMETHING I WANT TO ASK YOU, THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING ON THE SCOTT JENNINGS RADIO SHOW, ANOTHER HEADLINE, THE PRESIDENT REPEATING THAT THE GLOBAL TARIFF IS AN ECONOMIC EMERGENCY. THERE ARE SOME THAT WOULD ARGUE THAT THE U.S. NEEDED TO STEP UP ITS EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS MARKETS, AND IT WASN'T JUST A REPUBLICAN THING, IT WAS A DEMOCRATIC THING, AS WELL, IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PUSHBACK AGAINST CHINA. THE PANDEMIC REVEALED HOW MUCH OF OUR SUPPLY CHAINS WERE OVERSEEN BY CHINA. WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM IS DOING, WHAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU, WHAT DOESN'T? WENDY: HERE IS THE DEAL. THERE ARE NUMBER OF TRADE LAWS THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD USE TO PURSUE OUR TRADE AGENDA AGAINST CHINA. HE USED SECTION 301 OF THE TRAY LONG-TERM TRUMP 1.0. NO ONE CHALLENGED HIS LEGAL AUTHORITY TO USE THAT STATUTE. SO THIS IS COMING DOWN TO HIS USE OF A STATUTE, IEEPA, WHICH IS BASICALLY PREMISED UPON A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, AND THEN GIVES THE PRESIDENT UNLIMITED POWER. THAT IS WHERE THE COURTS ARE PUSHING BACK. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, THERE ARE OTHER STATUTES THAT FRANKLY COULD BE USED AND ARE MORE FIT FOR PURPOSE THAN IEEPA IN THE CURRENT SITUATION. CAROL: ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO ASK YOU, BECAUSE WE JUST DID A BIG DEEP DIVE INTO THAT RULING WE GOT FRIDAY NIGHT, WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE APPEALS COURT RULED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TARIFFS WERE ISSUED ILLEGALLY, UPHOLDING THAT MAY RULING BY THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE. SOUNDS LIKE THERE WILL BE OF SOME BACK-AND-FORTH BEFORE WE GET A RESOLUTION. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WILL ULTIMATELY END UP? WILL THEY BE OVERTURNED, NOT LIKELY? DO YOU HAVE A GOOD THOUGHT ON THAT? WENDY: ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY DO, I DON'T BELIEVE THEM. THIS WILL PROBABLY GO TO THE SUPREME COURT AND NONE OF US CAN PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THE POINT I WOULD MAKE, EVEN IF THE PRESIDENT LOSES AND THE SUPREME COURT VOTES AGAINST HIM, THERE ARE OTHER TRADE LAWS THAT HE CAN USE TO ADVANCE HIS TRADE AGENDA. YES, IT WOULD BE A SETBACK, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE THAT HE WOULD GIVE UP ON TARIFFS. I THINK WE ARE LIVING IN A TARIFF WORLD UNDER DONALD TRUMP FOR THE NEXT THREE AND HALF YEARS, WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. TIM: DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE JUST FOR THE NEXT THREE AND HALF YEARS, AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT, EVEN IF IT WAS A DEMOCRAT, WOULD REMOVE THESE TARIFFS? THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR A GOVERNMENT THAT LIKES TO SPEND MONEY, WHETHER YOU ARE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TAKE PLACE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. ONE THAT HAS NOW, THANKS TO THE NEW TAX BILL, HAS SOME SERIOUS SOURCES OF REVENUE. WENDY: THE OTHER POINT I WOULD ADD, BIDEN CAP TO MANY OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS IN PLACE, AS WELL. I THINK YOU MAKE AN EXCELLENT POINT. THAT SAID, THE NEXT PRESIDENT MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT AGENDA IN PUTTING A LOT OF EMPHASIS IN TRYING TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS. ONE OF THE HEARSE THINK THEY WILL ASK FOR IS A RELAXATION OF TARIFFS. I'M NOT SURE THAT ALL OF THE TARIFFS WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE AS IS, OR THERE COULD BE OTHER OPTIONS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS REACHED, OR OTHER STEPS TAKEN WHICH COULD ALLAY SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. CAROL: MAKES IT TRICKY FOR INVESTORS, CEOS TO MAKE DECISIONS WHEN THINGS COULD SWITCH AGAIN IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WENDY CUTLER, VP OF THE ASIA SOCIETY POLICY INSTITUTE. WHEN WE COME BACK, ACTION IN THE PACKAGE GOODS CONSUMER SPACE. PRESSURE ON PEPSI. LISA: 2:40. I'M LISA MATEO. MARKETS WATCHING THE NEXT STEPS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AFTER MOST OF THE DEAREST WORLD -- TARIFFS WERE RULED ILLEGAL. THE NASDAQ IS DOWN 1%. THE DOW IS DOWN .9%. THE S & P 500 IS OFF BY ABOUT 1%. 73 POINTS. 2-YEAR, 3.60 5%, UP FOUR BASIS POINTS. 10-YEAR, 4.20 7%, UP FOUR BASIS POINTS. WTI CRUDE ABOUT 2%. SPOT GOLD AT 3530. SHARES OF TARGET ARE DOWN NEARLY 4%, THE MOST SINCE MID AUGUST. THE REASON WHY? THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ENDORSED A BOYCOTT AGAINST THE RETAILER'S DECISION TO END SOME DIVERSITY PROGRAMS. FRONTIER AIRLINES FLYING HIGH COME UP 13%. DEUTSCHE BANK LIST OF THE CARRIER TO A BUY FROM A HOLD, SAID IT IS BEST POSITIONED TO BENEFIT FROM SPIRIT'S BANKRUPTCY. WE CHECK IN WITH SHARES OF AIR POLICE, UP ABOUT 6%. ELON MUSK PREDICTING TESTABLE DERIVE 80% OF ITS VALUE FROM HUMANOID ROBOTS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE FIRST TALKED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO.

FOR ON-DEMAND NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, SUBSCRIBE TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW OR WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. I'M LISA MATEO. THAT IS A BLOOMBERG BUSINESS FLASH. CAROL: I AM SO INTO A HUMANOID ROBOT. BRING IT ON BABY DO MY LAUNDRY, THE DISHWASHER. I AM SO INTO THAT. TIM: UNTIL IT TURNS AGAINST YOU. UNTIL IT TURNS INTO THE BOSS. THEN WHAT HAPPENS? CAROL: IT IS ALL FUN AND GAMES UNTIL IT TURNS AGAINST YOU. WHAT WAS THAT MOVIE THAT WAS ON? THE DAUGHTER OF BRIAN WILLIAMS, ALLISON WILLIAMS, SHE BRINGS HOME A ROBOT. YOU ARE THE COOL ONE THAT WATCHES ALL OF THE STREAMING STUFF. TIM: FALSE. I AM CATCHING UP ON \"BLACKMAILER.\" -- \"BLACK MIRROR.\" IT IS LITERALLY OUR LIFE RIGHT NOW, THIS EPISODE FROM 10 YEARS AGO, AI. IT IS HAVING A SEASON THAT IS BRINGING BACK VIEWERS WHICH IS PRETTY REMARKABLE. CAROL: VERY TOPICAL, LIKE SNL. TIM: THEY ARE TAKING TWO WEEKS IN BETWEEN EPISODES TO REALLY DEAL WITH THE NEWS AND BRING YOU THOSE CURRENT EVENTS. CAROL: I THINK IT IS PRETTY COOL STUFF. INTERESTING. TIM: CAROL MASSAR, BIG \"SOUTH PARK\" FAN. CAROL: CATCHING SOME CLIPS ONLINE, IT IS PRETTY FUNNY. HUMOR IS A PART OF CULTURE. IT'S OK, EVERYBODY. TIM: DID YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH KRAFT HEINZ? SHARES ARE LOWERED TODAY BY ABOUT 7.5%, THE COMPANY PLANNING ON SPLITTING INTO TWO COMPANIES. ONE SELLING HEINZ KETCHUP, THE OTHER SELLING SLOWER GROWING GROCERY PRODUCTS. WARREN BUFFETT SAYING DISAPPOINTED IN THE PLAN SPLIT, BUT HE CAN SEE THAT THE MERGER HE ORCHESTRATED MORE THAN A DECADE AGO WAS NOT A BRIGHT IDEA. CAROL: KIND OF ICONIC WHEN THEY CAME TOGETHER. HE DID SPEAK WITH BECKY QUICK OVER AT CNBC ABOUT THIS SPECIFICALLY. I WILL SAY, WHAT IS INTERESTING IN OUR RIGHT UP ON THIS, WE REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE KRAFT HEINZ BET MARKS A RARE MISSTEP FOR WARREN BUFFETT. THE MAKER OF HEINZ KETCHUP AND KRAFT MAC & CHEESE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH A MAJOR SHIFT AWAY FROM PACKAGED FOODS. THINK ABOUT HOW WE EAT. HOW MANY PEOPLE EAT. IT IS NOT LIKE IT WAS MAYBE 30 YEARS AGO. EVEN 10 YEARS AGO. TIM: IT HAS CHANGED A LOT, BUT CONSUMERS WHAT HAS CHANGED, BUT IT'S ALSO AT A TIME WHEN YOU SEE COMPANIES FOR THE LAST DECADE AND BIGGER WAS BETTER AND TOGETHER WAS STRONGER. YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK WITH DR. PEPPER-KEURIG, THE BREAKUP OF GE, THE WAY THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING FOR SHAREHOLDERS. I KNOW THIS STUFF IS VERY CYCLICAL. WHAT MOVES ONE WAY WILL NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN, BUT WE ARE IN AN ERA WHERE COMPANIES ARE DECIDING, ONE PLUS ONE IS THREE. CAROL: THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE BUYING OR NOT BUYING. KRAFT HEINZ, THE STOCK IS DOWN 7% TODAY. ALSO SOME NEWS ON PEPSICO. ELLIOTT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUILDING A STAKE OF $4 BILLION IN THE COMPANY. PEPSICO RALLYING ABOUT 6% TODAY. WITH US NOW IS KEN SHEA, SENIOR ANALYST FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS. HE IS OUT THERE IN PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY. LET'S START WITH KRAFT HEINZ. IS THIS ALL ABOUT CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND TRENDS? KEN: IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO JUST THAT. 2012, KRAFT SPUN OFF MONDELEZ. CAROL: IT IS LIKE A FAR AWAY LAND. ANYWAYS, CONTINUE. KEN: THE THOUGHT WAS, LET'S BREAK UP THE GROWTHY BUSINESS FROM THE SLOW GROWTH BUSINESS, OSCAR MEYER, CHEESES AND SO ON. FAST-FORWARD TO TODAY, THE COMPANY IS FURTHER SEGMENTING THAT HUGE CONGLOMERATE. THEY ARE SAYING THE GROCERY BUSINESS, THE CHEESE, OSCAR MEYER, THEY KEEP ON GETTING DISSED, THE OTHER BUSINESS IS HIGHER-MARGIN AND WILL SEPARATE IT. DOES IT ADD VALUE? TIME WILL TELL. IT SEEMS WE LEARN THAT BIG CONGLOMERATES AND SLOW GROWTH BUSINESSES ARE TOUGH TO ADD VALUE TO. YOU HAVE TO MANAGE THEM COME YOU CANNOT JUST KEEP CARVING THEM UP. TIM: LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE MEDIA WORLD WHAT COMCAST, SPINNING OFF ITS MEDIA DIVISIONS. I AM CURIOUS, IN YOUR VIEW, IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS CYCLICAL OR THE NEW NORMAL? THESE COMPANIES ARE SAYING, WE ARE GOING TO SEPARATE THE HIGH-VALUE, HIGH-GROWTH STUFF FROM THE LEGACY STUFF, BY THAT ARE TALKING METEOR CONSUMER PACKAGE GOODS. KEN: IT KIND OF DEPENDS. IN THE CASE OF KEURIG-DR. PEPPER, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE COLD BEVERAGE BUSINESS WAS UPPER THE COFFEE BUSINESS. I THINK THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THAT. IT'S A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF PRICE INCREASES. THAT MAY BE A COMPANY SPECIFIC THING. KRAFT HEINZ, I DON'T THINK IT IS CYCLICAL. I THINK IT IS CHANGING LIFESTYLES AND PREFERENCES. WE KNOW WITH THE GLP-1 DRUG ON TATE, CONSUMERS ARE TELLING US THEY ARE CUTTING BACK ON HIGH CALORIC FOODS INCLUDING RED MEATS, GRAVITATING TOWARD HEALTHIER OPTIONS. THEY LIKE CONVENIENT OPTIONS. IT IS REALLY A SHIFT IN CONSUMER TASTE THAT IS ULTIMATELY DRIVING THIS. CAROL: WE ARE TALKING WITH KEN SHEA OF OUR BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE TEAM. AT THE SAME TIME, PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING COMMENTS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS LIVE, SURROUNDED BY MEMBERS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, THE VICE PRESIDENT VANCE BEHIND HIM, SECRETARY HEGSETH IS THERE. MONITORING THE COMMENTS. AS EXPECTED, TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THE U.S. SPACE COMMAND MOVING FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA TO COLORADO. LET'S LISTEN IN FOR JUST A MOMENT. > > HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT. THAT IS BILLIONS BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE MILLIONS. IT IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS DECISION WILL HELP AMERICA DEFEND AND DOMINATE THE HIGH FRONTIER, AS THEY CALL IT. I WANT TO THANK SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH, DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE, TROY MEEK, THANK YOU. GREAT JOB YOU ARE DOING. THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL. THIS IS ONE THAT EVERYONE WANTED TO KNOW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATORS KATIE BRITT -- I WANT TO GIVE MY CONDOLENCES. GRANDMOTHER JUST PASSED AWAY. SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF YOU. VERY PROUD OF YOU. THANK YOU, KATIE. TO PRODUCE YOU INDIRECTLY, I CAN TELL YOU. TOMMY TUBERVILLE, GREAT COACH. I WON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH ALABAMA FOOTBALL THIS WEEKEND. YOU ARE NOT USED TO THAT. AUBURN WON. SO YOU ARE HAPPY. TOMMY HAS BEEN A GREAT SENATOR, FANTASTIC GUY ALL AROUND. HE WAS ALSO A TREMENDOUS COACH. HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE CHAIR MIKE ROGERS, THANK YOU. WHERE IS MIKE? DOING GREAT, MIKE. REPRESENTATIVES BARRY MOORE ALL, ROBERT ADDERALL, GARY PALMER, DARRELL STRAHL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN MY FIRST TERM, WE CREATED AND I CREATED A THING CALLED SPACE FORCE. SO IMPORTANT. WE WERE LOSING THE RACE IN SPACE VERY BADLY TO CHINA AND RUSSIA. NOW WE ARE FAR AND AWAY NUMBER ONE IN SPACE, AND REESTABLISH SPACECOM WITH A MISSION TO PROTECT AMERICAN SPACE ASSETS AND DETECT ANY THREAT TO OUR HOMELAND. WE INITIALLY SELECTED HUNTSVILLE FOR THE SPACECOM HEADQUARTERS BUT THOSE PLANS WERE WRONGFULLY OBSTRUCTED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, AND AS YOU KNOW THEY MOVED INTO A DIFFERENT LOCALE. TODAY, WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH WHAT WE WANT TO DO, THE PLACE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE THIS. THIS WILL BE THERE FOR HOPEFULLY HUNDREDS OF YEARS. THAT IS WHERE IT IS GOING TO BE. I WANT TO THANK COLORADO. THE PROBLEM I HAVE WHAT COLORADO, ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS, THEY WENT TO ALL MALE-IN BUILDING, SO THEY HAVE AUTOMATICALLY CROOKED ELECTIONS. WE CANNOT HAVE THAT BIG WHEN A STATE IS FOR MAIL HAVE BEEN IN VOTING, THAT MEANS THEY WANT DISHONEST ELECTIONS. THAT PLAYED A BIG FACTOR ALSO. IN HUNTSVILLE, SPACE, PLAYED KEY ROLE IN BUILDING THE GOLDEN DOME. THAT WILL BE A BIG THING. EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN IT. MISSILE DEFENSE SHIELD, WE WILL BE HAVING A GOLDEN DOME THE LIKES OF WHICH NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. FINEST, THE BEST. CANADA CALLED, THEY WANT TO BE A PART OF IT. CANADA WANTS VERY MUCH TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT. WE ARE GOING TO WORK SOMETHING OUT WITH THEM I HOPE. TO ALSO ENSURE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES OF WHICH WE ARE WAY AHEAD OF ANYBODY ELSE, NOBODY CLOSE, REMAINS UNMATCHED LONG INTO THE FUTURE. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK SECRETARY HEGSETH TO SAY A FEW WORDS. HE WAS A PART OF IT. EVERYONE OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD CALL ME AND LOBBY ME. KATIE, I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU ANYMORE. I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. SHE SAID, THAT'S RIGHT. AND THEY GOT THEIR WAY. I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE. THESE ARE REALLY SPECIAL PEOPLE. THEY ARE POLITICIANS IN MANY WAYS BUT THEY ARE GREAT PATRIOTS, EVEN MORE SO THAN POLITICIANS. THEY FOUGHT HARD TO GET IT AND IT'S AN HONOR TO GIVE IT TO HUNTSVILLE. PETE? SAY A FEW WORDS, PLEASE. CAROL: YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE OVAL OFFICE. THE DEFENSE SECRETARY NOW STEPPING TO THE PODIUM. THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT MOVINGCOMMAND -- THE HEADQUARTERS, RELOCATING FROM ALABAMA, A RED STATE -- FROM COLORADO, FROM A DEMOCRATIC BLUE STATE TO A RED STATE, ALABAMA. THAT IS THE BIG HEADLINE, ALSO TALKING ABOUT WORKING OUT SOMETHING WITH CANADA ON THE GOLDEN DOME, THE PROTECTION IN TERMS OF DEFENSE. TIM: THE PRESIDENT SAID HIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM WITH COLORADO IS MAIL-IN VOTING, AND THAT WAS WHAT HIS ISSUE IS WITH THE STATE. CAROL: EXACTLY. TIM: IN 2020, WE SHOULD NOTE, THE PRESIDENT DID VOTE BY MAIL. CAROL: INTERESTING TO SEE THE STUFF MOVING AROUND. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS FROM THE OVAL OFFICE AND BRING YOU ANYTHING OF NOTE. IN THE MEANTIME, WE WANT TO SAY THANKS TO KEN SHEA, WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT KRAFT HEINZ SPLITTING UP INTO TWO SEPARATE COMPANIES. HE IS OUR SENIOR ANALYST FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS JOINING US FROM BI HEADQUARTERS. YOU ARE WATCHING \"BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK DAILY.\" TIM: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME STOCKS ON THE MOVE TODAY. WE ARE JOINED BY A EMILY GRAFFEO FROM THE BLOOMBERG NEWS CROSS ASSET TEAM. A LOT TO CHOOSE FROM ESPECIALLY ON THE DOWNSIDE TODAY. EMILY: I WILL START OUT ON A HIGH NOTE. WHY NOT? PEPSICO, TICKER PEP, WAS UP 6% TODAY. NOW IT IS UP ABOUT 2% BUT ON DEALNEWS. ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN A 4% STAKE IN THE COMPANY. THEY WILL BE ONE OF THE LARGEST INVESTORS. THE MOVEMENT IN SHARES TODAY SHOW THAT SHAREHOLDERS LIKE POTENTIAL CHANGE COMING WITH ELLIOTT. THEY SAID IN THE PRESENTATION, ELLIOTT, THAT PEPSICO SHOULD REVIEW AND STREAMLINE THEIR SNACKS PORTFOLIO MY DIVEST UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS, AND THEY ARE ALSO CONSIDERING RE-FRANCHISING THE BEVERAGE UNITS, BOTTLING NETWORK. I LEARNED ABOUT BUNDLING TODAY. TIM: IT WORKED OUT WELL FOR COCA-COLA. EMILY: BASICALLY LET PEPSICO FOCUS ON THE BRAND AND THE MARKETING OF THE SODAS, OUTSOURCE ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT GO TOWARD MODELING THE SODAS. CAROL: THEY HAVE A MASSIVE BOTTLING OPERATION. I WAS DOING SOME GOOGLING ABOUT FRITOS, WHICH IS OWNED BY PEPSICO. TIM: YOU LIKE THEM? CAROL: LOVE THEM. EMILY: THAT IS ONE OF THEIR CORE BRANDS, SO I WOULD IMAGINE PEPSICO WOULD FOCUS MORE ON MAKING THAT. THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY HAS ACTUALLY PLUNGED MORE THAN 20% FROM THE PEAK IN MAY 2023. ALTHOUGH IT IS A NAME THAT WE WOULD KNOW AND LOVE, THE BRANDS NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP HERE. TIM: PRE-PANDEMIC, MAYBE EVEN AFTER THE PANDEMIC, FOR QUITE A WHILE, THE SNACK BRANDS BUSINESS WAS HOPING TO KEEP PEPSI AFLOAT, SOMETHING THAT ANALYST SAID, COCA-COLA DOESN'T HAVE THIS SNACK SIDE OF THE BUSINESS THAT PEPSI DOES. AGAIN, CONSUMER PREFERENCE IS SHIFTING. CAROL: WE ARE NOW EATING A LOT OF VEGGIES AND HUMMUS. LET'S TALK ABOUT CONSTELLATION BRANDS. EMILY: MAYBE ANOTHER STORY OF CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES. CONSTELLATION BRANDS, THE PARENT COMPANY OF A NUMBER OF ALCOHOL BRANDS, MODELO, CORONA. THEY CUT THEIR FISCAL 2026 GUIDANCE TODAY CITING WEEK CONSUMER DEMAND THAT WILL HURT INVENTORY REBALANCING AT THE DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL. THAT STOCK FELL 7%. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE CEO HAD TO SAY, OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, HIGH-END BEER BUY RATES DECLINED. I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SHOW. GEN Z DOESN'T LIKE ALCOHOL AS MUCH AS OLDER GENERATIONS. CAROL: A LOT OF BEVERAGE COMPANIES TALK ABOUT THE PUSHBACK IN DECLINING NUMBERS, WHETHER IT IS WINE OR BEER. EMILY: IT IS NOT ME. [LAUGHTER] TIM: IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, YOU DON'T DRINK DURING THE WEEK, WHICH IS SOMETHING I LEARNED ABOUT YOU. A GENERATION AGO, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD THAT FROM SOMEBODY. CAROL: DO YOU MAKE UP FOR IT ON THE WEEKEND? TIM: YOU MAKE ME SOUND SO LAME. CAROL: I GUESS IT IS DIFFERENT. EMILY: GEN Z IS FOCUSED ON WELLNESS. YOU DON'T SEE THAT AS MUCH. YOU CAN SEE THAT IN CONSTELLATION BRANDS' FORECAST. SALES GROWTH FROM 6% DOWN TO 4%. CAROL: WE HAVE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT KRAFT HEINZ, FOR GOOD REASON. 30 SECONDS ON WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT. EMILY: THE STOCK IS DOWN MAJORLY TODAY. THEY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SPLIT INTO TWO SEPARATE COMPANIES BUT THE STREET IS NOT HAPPY. WARREN BUFFETT IS NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT. BASICALLY, TWO COMPANIES, ONE SELLING HEINZ KETCHUP, BOXED MEALS, ANOTHER SELLING SLOWER GROWING GROCERY PRODUCTS. RIGHT NOW THE STOCK IS DOWN OVER 7%. CAROL: THEY ARE WONDERING WHERE THIS ULTIMATELY GOES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE, EMILY GRAFFEO.
