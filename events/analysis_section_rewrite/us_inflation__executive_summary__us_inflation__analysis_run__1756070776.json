Elevated Velocity signaling) with exact source IDs; include 3–4 invalidation tests with concrete signals and sources (inflation/wage growth momentum per J99EM2TPZ and T1QE6JPIX, tariff momentum reversal per 0J41Q7KTX/S15934PBQ, and policy credibility via U6HXAJR4J/U6H); finish with a tight 4–5 item watch-list (tariff pass-through, GM milestones, AI‑adoption metrics in auto retail, Pacaso/Range financing milestones) and 4–8 week horizons, attaching IDs after each claim; ensure the probabilities/weights (Base 45–55%, Tariff-escalation 20–30%, AI/EV-led 25–35%) and the 0–2/2–4/4–6 month cadence are stated as the backbone, with all claims tied to NL5YYTLF2, SGB2PAZGK, J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, EPJYXB7DX, WTNT85IPR, UPV3X2MQ6, 0J41Q7KTX, S15934PBQ, CDBMWIUTB, 2QRLB974F, YVQU6QCY4, and U6HXAJR4J; move ancillary household/retirement content to an appendix to preserve focus on the market view.",
