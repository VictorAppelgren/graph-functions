  "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Aegon Ltd. (AMS:AGN) share price has soared 194% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also up 8.9% in about a month. This could be related to the recent financial results that were recently released - you could check the most recent data by reading our company report.\n\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Aegon moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nWe know that Aegon has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Aegon stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Aegon, it has a TSR of 269% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nIt's nice to see that Aegon shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 30% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Aegon , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.",

  "argos_summary": "Aegon Ltd. has delivered a 194% share\u2011price increase over the past five years, with a total shareholder return of 269% that is largely driven by dividends. The company has transitioned from loss to profitability, with earnings growing at about 2.9% annually, but its revenue has declined sharply at roughly 34% per year. Financially, Aegon maintains a debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratio of 45.5% and an interest coverage of 3.2x, while its free cash flow remains modest. Despite solid dividend payouts and a strong TSR, the firm\u2019s earnings growth lags the broader insurance industry and its revenue trend signals potential challenges ahead.",
