Devers fired back as first base umpire Dan Bellino tried to hold him back.\nAs tensions rose, both dugouts emptied onto the field, with Giants stars Matt Chapman and Willy Adames both throwing shoves at Freeland despite umpires trying to prevent things from escalating.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he got like that,\u201d Devers said of Freeland after the game through an interpreter, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I mean, I did the same thing I do every time I hit a home run.\u201d\nThings appeared to finally cool down before the teams came close to one another, with cooler heads finally prevailing without more shoving.\nFreeland, Adames and Chapman were all ejected.\nThe Rockies starter called Devers\u2019 home run trot \u201cextremely disrespectful.\u201d\n\u201cExtremely disrespectful to show me up like that in the first inning after hitting a home run. Standing there, watching it, taking your sweet time getting down to first base,\u201d Freeland said, per the Denver Post. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this league quite some time, and I know he has as well. I just find that extremely disrespectful, and I felt that I needed to let him know about that.\u201d\nOnce the Giants cleared the field and Antonio Senzatela took over the pitching duties for Colorado, the umpiring crew made Devers finish rounding the bases after his 30th long ball of the season in what was a bizarre way to start the NL West clash."

      "text": "Access the Yankees beat like never before\nJoin Post Sports+ for exciting subscriber-only features, including real-time texting with Greg Joyce about the inside buzz on the Yankees.\nTry it freeAn Astros ace is accused of a bush-league maneuver \u2014 and this one doesn\u2019t involve a trash can.\nEx-MLB pitcher Dallas Braden and plenty of others allege that Houston lefty Framber Valdez intentionally plunked his catcher, Cesar Salazar, with a pitch after some confusion moments after allowing the game-changing grand slam to Trent Grisham in the Yankees\u2019 7-1 win Tuesday night.\n\u201c(One hundred percent) intentional,\u201d Braden tweeted above a clip of the controversial pitch. \u201cAbsolute trash behavior.\u201d\nValdez denied through a translator that he intentionally plunked his catcher and added that he apologized to Salazar, who said he pushed the wrong button on PitchCom.\n\u201cIt was not intentional,\u201d Valdez said after allowing six runs in five innings.\n\u201cI called for a sinker, and that\u2019s the pitch I wanted. There was a lot of noise and that\u2019s what I thought he wanted me to throw, but, no, it was not intentional.\u201d\nThe supposed inflection point for this alleged teammate-on-teammate crime happened in the fifth inning with Grisham at the plate in a 2-0 game with the bases loaded and two outs.\nAs Valdez readied to throw his 1-0 pitch, it appeared he shook his head \u2014 as Braden noted in a breakdown \u2014 and Salazar then motioned for him to step off the mound.\nValdez, though, committed to the pitch \u2014 later saying that he specifically called that offering \u2014 and threw a 96-mph sinker that Grisham went the other way with for a game-changing grand slam.\nThe lefty appeared quite ticked after allowing the homer.\nTwo pitches later, Valdez fired a pitch that Salazar clearly did not expect, and it hit off his protector\u2019s chest in a jarring moment, with the ball careening off the catcher.\nBraden noted this should not happen due to PitchCom, which allows the two to be on the same page.\n\u201cThis is the era of PitchCom,\u201d Braden said. \u201cYou can hear what\u2019s coming, you know what\u2019s coming, if you have any second guesses, you step off.\u201d\nWhen asked about how he communicated to Salazar that he wanted the sinker, Valdez said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d before later noting that he did not hear the curveball choice due to the noise.\n\u201cThat was just the pitch that I had in mind,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cHe called for a curveball, but I was already in mind that I was going to throw a sinker. That\u2019s what I threw, so that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\nValdez did not help himself by immediately turning his back after the pitch hit his catcher, not even checking to see if he was OK.\nSalazar notably started at Valdez for a few moments after the pitch before pushing his mask upward and walking toward Valdez before throwing the ball to him.\nValdez \u201cemphatically\u201d spoke in Spanish with Salazar in the clubhouse after the game, per MLB.com.\n\u201cWe just got crossed up,\u201d Valdez said through a translator.\n\u201cI called for that pitch, I threw it and we got crossed up. When we went down to the dugout, I excused myself with him and I said sorry to him and I take full responsibility for that.\u201d\nSalazar didn\u2019t accuse Valdez of any bad behavior, instead noting how many Yankees fans invaded Daikin Park for the important series.\n\u201cNo, didn\u2019t get crossed up,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cThere was a good amount of Yankees fans, so it was pretty loud after the grand slam. Maybe my PitchCom wasn\u2019t in the right spot, I pressed the wrong button, ya know?\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s outing marked yet another poor showing from the lefty ace while he heads toward free agency, with Valdez now 1-4 with a 5.66 ERA in his last seven starts.\nHe\u2019s 12-8 with a 3.40 ERA spanning 27 starts this season.\nThe Astros still lead the Mariners by three games in the AL West and occupy the No. 3 seed in the AL.\n\u201cHeat of the moment got to us,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cHe apologized after, he\u2019s great. There wasn\u2019t anything bad about it, just pressed the wrong button and I was expecting another pitch.\u201d"

      "text": "Access the Yankees beat like never before\nJoin Post Sports+ for exciting subscriber-only features, including real-time texting with Greg Joyce about the inside buzz on the Yankees.\nTry it freeHOUSTON \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Caballero arrived to the Yankees with the reputation of easily getting under opponent\u2019s skin.\nBut he may have the same knack with umpires, which is not nearly as productive.\nCaballero got ejected for the second time in two weeks Tuesday in the fourth inning of the 7-1 win over the Astros at Daikin Park.\nThe utilityman was upset after he was hit on the leg by a bouncing pitch from Framber Valdez, but he went around on his swing, with home plate umpire Ramon De Jesus ruling it a strike. He did not get much leash for arguing before De Jesus gave him a quick hook.\n\u201cAt this point, all I\u2019m thinking is I can\u2019t even look at them,\u201d Caballero said. \u201cNot really [warranted], but at this point, I can\u2019t get thrown out there.\n\u201cI was just explaining, \u2018How can you see everything happen? You\u2019re paying attention to the strike zone, paying attention to the ball bouncing, paying attention that I\u2019m jumping out of the way, you\u2019re paying attention [to] did the ball hit me, and you also see that I swung? That\u2019s crazy.\u2019 And he tossed me.\u201d\nIt was a brutal spot for Caballero to get his second ejection as a Yankee, on a night when he was starting at third base for his right-handed bat against the lefty Valdez. Caballero, who had doubled and stolen third in his first at-bat, was likely to move to the outfield by the end of the night, too, as a defensive replacement for Giancarlo Stanton. But instead he hit the showers early with lefty-hitting Ryan McMahon replacing him at third base, and Jasson Dom\u00ednguez eventually replacing Stanton in left field.\nManager Aaron Boone, who did not get out in time to protect his player from getting tossed, said he didn\u2019t \u201clove it,\u201d but added that he was \u201cnot as upset\u201d as he was when Caballero got ejected in extra innings against the Rays last month in Tampa and put the Yankees in an even tougher spot with a shorter bench.\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want our guys getting ejected from the game,\u201d Boone said. \u201cAs much as I can, I try to interject. He\u2019s too important to our team and to this game tonight. So it\u2019s something we got to continue to talk about and work on and hopefully improve on. But I don\u2019t want to put this in the Tampa class.\u201d\nPaul Blackburn gave the rest of the bullpen a breather, pitching the final two innings in relief of Max Fried and striking out four. He also made a nice play to end the game, snaring a soft liner and throwing to first for a double play.\nAustin Slater (hamstring strain) started a third rehab game on Tuesday night with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, going 1-for-3 with a walk and playing seven innings in left field. He figures to return from the IL by this weekend. \u2026 Cody Bellinger was named the AL Player of the Week on Tuesday after batting .444 with a 1.278 OPS last week."

      "text": "Superman has his kryptonite. Sisyphus had his rock. And Taylor Fritz has Novak Djokovic.\nFritz is gone from the U.S. Open, extending the American men\u2019s funk of Grand Slam futility to 22 straight years. And he was defeated once again by the man he\u2019s still never beaten, ousted by Djokovic 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in the quarterfinals.\n\u201cHe was the better player second and third set. I got really out of trouble in the second, somehow found a way,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI was just trying to survive.\n\u201cIn important moments in the fourth, I served well, mixed it up, came to the net. Just tried to give him a different look and waited patiently for my opportunity. \u2026 It\u2019s one of those days where you just have to grind. You just have to play with your heart and fight. That\u2019s what really gave me the win in the end.\u201d\nThat win sent the 38-year-old into a celebratory dance from \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d \u2014 in honor of his daughter Tara\u2019s birthday Tuesday \u2014 and into the semis vs. Carlos Alcaraz. And the loss sent Fritz to a galling 0-11 against his nemesis, wondering just what he\u2019ll have to do to finally break through.\nWell, breaking would be a start. He was 2-of-13 on break points, 0-of-5 just in the final game of the second set. For many moments, Fritz was every bit as good as Djokovic. The Serb won 130 points to his 126 \u2014 but Fritz couldn\u2019t get the ones he absolutely, positively had to have, double-faulting to end the match.\n\u201cRealistically, I just can\u2019t come out of those first two sets down two sets to love. I need to play better,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that makes the great players great: They win the big points.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to need to go out and take those points from him. He\u2019s not just going to hand them over to me. That\u2019s exactly what happened. \u2026 So it was tough for me to go out and take those points.\u201d\nThe night started off-kilter for Fritz, taking the court with his trademark Hugo Boss headband on upside down. When he finally changed it to start the third set, the momentum changed as well. But it was too little, too late.\nWith the crowd desperately wanting to get behind the last U.S. man standing, Djokovic willingly played the villain.\n\u201cI wear my heart on my sleeve for this sport,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cIt still matters.\u201d\nDjokovic had taken a bow after one impossible forehand crosscourt winner, then put his hand to his ear and waved to the crowd after taking the second set. But when he got heated at chair ump Damien Dumusois for not doing the impossible \u2014 silencing fired-up New Yorkers \u2014 the Frenchman offered him sage advice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to help, Novak,\u201d Dumusois warned.\nThe crowd \u2014 some of whom paid $10,000 to be in the stands \u2014 doubled and tripled down. They got louder, and Fritz got better, breaking to go up 3-1 in the third.\nWith just two aces through the first two sets, Fritz hit seven in the third. He capped a 13-shot rally with a winner to take the set.\nBut he wouldn\u2019t get the fourth.\nFritz is one of tennis\u2019 better servers, with the second-most aces on the tour this season. But after averaging 15, he didn\u2019t have any in the opening set, and was 1-of-11 on his second serve.\nDjokovic is history\u2019s greatest returner, and in the second set Fritz got just 38 percent of his first serves in.\nWith Djokovic serving up 5-3, Fritz had five break points but couldn\u2019t convert any of them. There was a 25-shot rally that saw Djokovic go for the line and point to his ear to troll the crowd en route to taking the set.\nFritz had been the last man to drop the first two sets to Djokovic and force a fifth, four years ago in Australia. But at 5-4 in the fourth, Djokovic stepped back deeper on Fritz\u2019s serve and the American\u2019s double-fault handed him the match.\n\u201cI had so many more chances that you\u2019re not going to see on a stat line,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cI was converting and playing these points just really poorly.\n\u201cJust bad decision-making, because I wasn\u2019t playing as well as I would\u2019ve wanted to.\u201d"
