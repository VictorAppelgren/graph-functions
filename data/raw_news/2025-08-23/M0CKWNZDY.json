  "description": "What does \"EMAW\" mean? Here's an explanation of Kansas State's rallying cry, its origin and what it stands for.",
  "content": "Kansas State opens the 2025 college football season on a big-time stage, when it takes on Big 12 foe Iowa State in the Aer Lingus College Football Classic in Week 0.\n\nThe annual international game in Dublin, Ireland, has been the first game of the season every year since 2022. The matchup will certainly draws loads of attention, for not only fans of both programs, but also those ready to see live action for the first time in months. College football fans unfamiliar with both teams will be exposed to plenty of traditions from both sides of the \"Farmageddon\" rivalry for the first time.\n\nK-State's \"EMAW\" saying is one of its chief rallying cries, and will definitely come into play during the game.\n\nHere's what \"EMAW\" means and how the saying was created:\n\nWhat does EMAW mean for Kansas State?\n\n\"EMAW\" means \"Every Man A Wildcat,\" and it has been the predominant rallying cry for Kansas State fans for years.\n\nIt's unclear when the saying started, but it's commonly said by fans to one another, and also is showcased on campus. It also appears on Kansas State-branded clothing from time to time.\n\nKansas State's famed \"Every Man A Wildcat\" banner that hung across the press box at Ahearn Field House disappeared in April 1971, never to be seen again. It was said to have been stolen by K-State baseball players, who tore it down and cut the banner into pieces, distributing it to each other, according to the university.\n\nBut the piece that included Willie Wildcat, Kansas State's mascot, reappeared in 2024 when a man tried selling his piece of the banner that had been sitting in his basement. The man eventually decided to return it to the school, and it's now framed and back at Ahearn Field House.\n\n\"That logo represents all that Kansas State basketball is about,\" former basketball coach Lon Kruger told the school. \"Shoot, Ahearn Field House, the old dirt floor that the court sat on, the clock that wound down and confused the opponents, that logo hung above all of that. Very, very special memories.\"",

      "text": "Kansas State University Athletics\nTraditions\nNICKNAME\nThrough its first 19 seasons of athletic competition, Kansas State had used \"Aggies\" as its nickname. But prior to the 1915 season, new coach John \"Chief\" Bender gave his squad the nickname \"Wildcats.\" The moniker lasted the one season Bender coached at K-State. Under Coach Z.G. Clevenger in 1917, the school team became known as the \"Farmers.\" In 1920 another new coach, Charles Bachman, took over the program, renaming the team \"Wildcats.\" This time, the nickname stuck.\nKansas State University, itself, is referred to in many different shortened versions. The preferred name is \"K-State\", which is used by alums, friends and journalists from coast to coast.\nWILLIE WILDCAT\nWillie, a student bedecked in a oversized Wildcat head, is Kansas State\u2019s No. 1 fan. Willie Wildcats are selected yearly by a panel appointed by the cheerleading coach. The mascot is a central part of athletic contests, but also attends functions around the state as an ambassador. Traditionally, the identity of the student portraying Willie is kept secret.\nTOUCHDOWN I-XI\nIn 1922, Hall-of-Famer Charles Bachman asked alumni to consider donating an actual Wildcat to the school to serve as a mascot. KSAC alumni Herbert R. Groome and John E. McCoy, both veterinarians in Twin Falls, Idaho, donated \"Touchdown I\" to the school shortly after the animal was nursed back to health under their care. (The bobcat had an encounter with a porcupine, and his face and throat were punctured by numerous quills. Unfortunately, Touchdown I never fully recovered from its fight, dying of pneumonia shortly after arriving in Manhattan.)\nAlthough the bobcats have served as K-State\u2019s wildcat mascot since 1922, the animals no longer attend K-State games. Touchdown XI, the 11th in the line, was kept at Manhattan\u2019s Sunset Zoo.\nCOLOR\nThe school color Royal Purple was adopted in the fall of 1896 by a committee of \"Miss Minnie L. Copeland, Jr. and Miss Winnifred Houghton and Miss Ina E. Holyrod, of the senior class, and perhaps one or more others.\" Although K-State\u2019s only official color is purple, white has been used as a complimentary color for many years. Silver is also a common second or third color. Former head basketball coach Cotton Fitzsimmons incorprated gold during his two-year stint (1968-70), but gold or yellow has not been used since that time. The term \"Purple Pride,\" which is often used in association with KSU athletics, was given rise during the tenure of head football coach Vince Gibson (1967-74).\nPOWERCAT LOGO\nOne of the most recognizable athletic logos in the nation is the K-State Powercat. The logo was introduced by Bill Snyder shortly after his arrival in Manhattan as the attitude of the entire athletics department and university was changing.\nManhattan native Tom Bookwalter, in cooperation with head coach Bill Snyder,\ncreated the powerful logo that is a prominent feature on the K-State football helmet, at Wagner Field, on the back of the Dev Nelson Pressbox, clothing, flags, bottled water, vanity plates for cars and just about anywhere in Manhattan.\nPrevious logos used by the athletics department included a line drawing of a wildcat head and the cartoonish \"Willie the Wildcat\" that is used only by the Alumni Association.\nALMA MATER\nThe Alma Mater was selected as a result of an 1888 campus contest. H.W. Jones (\u201988) was responsible for K-State\u2019s prized result. Jones\u2019 original work was four stanzas including the chorus. His version has been slightly altered over the years to include just two stanzas and the changing of the words from Kansas State Agricultural College to Kansas State University.\n\"I know a spot that I love full well, 'Tis not in forest nor yet in dell, ever it holds me with magic spell, I think of thee Alma Mater.\nKSU, we\u2019ll carry the banner high, KSU long, long may thy colors fly. Loyal you to thee thy children will swell the cry.\nHail, Hail, Hail Alma Mater.\"\nFIGHT SONG (WILDCAT VICTORY)\n\"Fight you K-State Wildcats. For Alma Mater fight-fight-fight.\nGlory in the combat for the purple and the white. Faithful to our colors, we will ever be, fighting ever fighting for a Wildcat Victory!\nGO STATE!\"\nWABASH CANNONBALL\nEveryone knows that familiar tune Wabash Cannonball. In fact, Wabash and K-State are almost synonymous. What many people do not know is how the song became an integral part of Wildcat athletics. In the fall of 1968 the department of music burnt down. Every piece of music in the building was destroyed. The only thing that was salvaged was what was in the band director\u2019s brief case. That included a piece of music titled the Wabash Cannonball. With an upcoming basketball game and no music, that left only one thing to do. The band members played the song loud and often. A song that originally had no connection to KSU became a second fight song.\nSLOGANS\nSeveral chants and slogans are used in association with the team. \"Purple Pride\" and \"Eat 'Em Up, Eat 'Em Up K-S-U\" are just a few. One of the most popular phrases among fans is \"EMAW\" or, \"Every Man a Wildcat\". Tracing its roots back through decades of K-State athletics history, fans are unified behind the rallying cry, declaring they are all part of the Wildcat nation."

      "text": "Kansas State thinking College Football Playoff after Avery Johnson declined NIL offers\nOf course it came back around. All it took was Chris Klieman to admit it, and open yet another window to the absurdity of the now transactional sport of college football.\nFortunately for Kansas State, star quarterback Avery Johnson didn\u2019t bite at NIL offers from bigger schools.\nBecause pushing out a championship starting quarterback last year for his potentially rare backup, only to have the potentially rare quarterback leave a year later, would\u2019ve been peak transfer portal nonsense.\nInstead, there was Johnson, representing K-State at Big 12 Media Days, setting lofty goals for Year 2 as a starter. And maybe finally reaching those Johnny Manziel comparisons.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for the season to begin,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday, July 8 at Big 12 Media Days. \u201cWe\u2019re shooting for a Big 12 championship. Anything else would be a letdown.\u201d\nAnd speaking of letdowns, get a load of this drama: It was prior to last season when Klieman \u2013 one of two coaches in school history to win a conference championship in the modern era \u2013 gambled on Johnson by placing the program in his hands.\nWill Howard had one season of eligibility remaining, and was a year removed from leading K-State to its first Big 12 championship since 2012. He and Klieman met, and they decided maybe both needed a fresh start.\nJohnson led K-State to nine wins in 2024, and had the Wildcats in the College Football Playoff hunt until the last week of the regular season.\nHoward led Ohio State to the national championship.\nBIG PLANS: The billionaire booster who wants to save college sports\nTOP 25: Ranking the best college football quarterbacks\nIn a not so surprising twist of irony, when the offseason arrived, guess who was fielding transfer opportunities from major Power conference teams? That would be Johnson \u2014 the same quarterback Klieman elevated over Howard in 2024 to prevent Johnson from leaving for the transfer portal in the first place.\nLook, it\u2019s a business now. A crazy, unbridled mess of a business.\n\u201cBut he likes it here,\u201d Klieman said of Johnson, who threw 25 touchdown passes in 2024, and rushed for more than 600 yards in his first season as a starter.\nReally, he does. Johnson grew up in Wichita, about two hours south of the campus in Manhattan. He knows Kansas, he has lived Kansas.\nMore important: Kansas loves him. Johnson has an impressive NIL portfolio, which recently added deals with CVS and a regional telecommunications provider.\nThis on the heels of a deal last year with a local car dealership, which paved the way for him to drive around Manhattan in a lavender Corvette Stingray and black Mercedes AMG GT.\nNot only that, you, too, can swig Johnson\u2019s favorite drink (strawberry lemonade) thanks to an NIL deal with a local drink manufacturer. So yeah, life is good in Kansas.\nNow it\u2019s time to make it even better on the field.\nJohnson says he has gained \u201c10-12 pounds\u201d in the offseason, has built strength and hasn\u2019t lost what makes him so dangerous: speed and dynamic athleticism.\nHe says the game moves slower now, and Klieman added more pieces around Johnson with key transfer portal additions to further develop the pass game. Three of K-State's top four receivers arrived this offseason from other schools.\n\u201cThe best supporting cast I could ask for,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different feeling now. I\u2019m so much farther ahead of where I was at this time last year.\u201d\nLast month, Johnson was invited to the Manning Passing Academy, an invitation typically reserved for the elite of the game. He roomed with Gunner Stockton (Georgia), Marcel Reed (Texas A&M) and Austin Simmons (Mississippi).\n\u201cAn SEC room,\u201d Johnson joked.\nWho knows just how close he came to joining that conference, and competing in the quarterback-heavy league. How close K-State went from experiencing both sides of transfer portal turnover at the most important position on the field.\nFrom a difficult choice one year, to a difficult departure the next. From learning on the job one season, to improving his completion percentage, and making better decisions post snap.\nHe understands the position and the concepts. Now it\u2019s all about refining his game, and reaching the massive expectations coming out of high school.\n\u201cI love this team, I love the chemistry we\u2019re building,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEverybody should be excited.\u201d\nBecause Johnson didn\u2019t bite \u2014 and allow what goes around to come back around.\nMatt Hayes is the senior national college football writer for USA TODAY Sports Network.

The article highlights K\u2011State\u2019s rich heritage\u2014from the historic Powercat logo and Willie Wildcat mascot to the evolution of nicknames and school colors\u2014and notes the return of the banner that disappeared in 1971. It also discusses quarterback Avery Johnson\u2019s decision to stay at K\u2011State amid NIL offers, his 2024 performance, and the coaching stability under Chris Klieman, positioning the Wildcats as a contender for a Big\u202f12 title.
