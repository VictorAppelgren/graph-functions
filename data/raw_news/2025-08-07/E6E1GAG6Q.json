  "content": "Democratic strategist James Carville urged on Wednesday that Democrats open \"Pandora\u2019s Box\" and execute multiple controversial power grabs to \"save democracy,\" including establishing a permanent electoral majority the next time they gain power.\n\n\"The Democrats talk about democracy \u2013 the importance of democracy and preserving democracy and saving democracy,\" Carville said. \"Well, the truth of the matter is, people are right when they say this democracy is really imperfect.\"\n\nCarville listed several perceived imbalances in the current system, including Texas attempting to redraw its congressional districts. He argued that if Democrats can pull off a resounding victory in 2028 \u2013 winning the presidency, the Senate, and the House \u2013 they should use it to enshrine their power in unprecedented ways.\n\n\"They are just going to have to unilaterally add Puerto Rico and District of Columbia states,\" Carville said.\n\n\"They're going to have to do it. They're just going to have to do it. And they may have to expand the [Supreme Court] to 13 members,\" he said.\n\nWhile he once would have viewed such actions as politically risky, Carville argued that the Democrats have no other choice in this era of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Any of those things in isolation I would be skeptical about. I would be cautious about. I would say, 'Well, I don't know if that's the greatest idea in the world, you're opening Pandora's Box,\u2019\" he said. \"If you want to save democracy, I think you got to do all of those things because we just are moving further and further away from being anything close to democracy.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCarville said he was unsure if \"it's something that they should talk about during the campaign,\" but argued it should be a day one priority once Democrats are elected.",

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX, is reintroducing a constitutional amendment to cap the number of Supreme Court Justices at nine, amid calls to expand the court.\nCruz, now joined by 19 cosponsors including Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy (LA), Chuck Grassley (IA), Mike Crapo (ID), Thom Tillis (NC) and John Cornyn (TX), previously introduced the amendment in 2021 and in 2023.\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Cruz said Democrats are seeking to \"use the Court to advance policy goals they can\u2019t accomplish electorally.\"\n\"Such a move would be a direct assault on the design of our Constitution, which is designed to ensure the Supreme Court remains a non-partisan guardian of the rule of law,\" Cruz said. \"This amendment is a badly-needed check on their efforts to undermine the integrity of the Court.\"\nLikewise, Grassley said the amendment would ensure the Court's independence from political pressures.\n\"Democrats\u2019 radical court packing scheme would erase the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and destroy historic precedent,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"The Court is a co-equal branch of government, and our Keep Nine Amendment will ensure that it remains independent from political pressure.\"\nThe nine-justice court currently has a conservative supermajority. Following various landmark decisions in recent years, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, Democrats have re-upped calls to impose court reforms, including expanding and packing the court as well as imposing term limits.\nIn October, then-Vice President Kamala Harris entertained the notion of imposing court reforms during a CNN town hall. Harris was asked if she would support expanding the number of justices from the current nine to 12.\n\"There is no question that the American people increasingly are losing confidence in the Supreme Court and, in large part, because of the behavior of certain members of that court and because of certain rulings, including the Dobbs decision and taking away a precedent that had been in place for 50 years, protecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body,\" Harris said during the event.\n\"So, I do believe that there should be some kind of reform of the court, and we can study what that actually looks like.\"\nPORN CASE IN THE SUPREME COURT THIS WEEK IS ABOUT PROTECTING CHILDREN, SAYS REPUBLICAN AG\nRep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, also called for reforming the Court that same month, saying in social media posts, \"We need to radically reform the broken Supreme Court.\"\nDemocrats have consistently proposed legislation to expand the Supreme Court to a 13-justice bench.\nIn May 2023, Georgia Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson joined Democratic Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Tina Smith of Minnesota, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as Democratic Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York, Cori Bush of Mississippi, and Adam Schiff of California, in reintroducing the Judiciary Act of 2023.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"We want to prevent this kind of rot and decay from ever overtaking a Supreme Court again,\" Johnson told Fox News Digital in October."

They claim the redistricting will disenfranchise minority voters.\nSpeaking to former CNN host Don Lemon from an \"undisclosed location\" in New York, Jones emphasized the importance of standing up against such \"racist\" actions to avoid the same mistakes that led to the Holocaust.\nBETO ENCOURAGES DEMOCRATS TO FIGHT 'FIRE WITH FIRE' IN TEXAS REDISTRICTING BATTLE\n\"We better have the courage to stand up, otherwise we will fall for anything,\" she said. \"And in this country, we will be defeated, deported.

How was somebody in a position to kill all them people?\u2019 Well, good people remain silent or good people didn't realize that what happens to them can very soon happen to me or somebody I love.\n\"And so, even if you made it, man, you have an obligation to help people who can't because, God forbid, they end up targeting you and your family.\"\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital on Tuesday, Jones apologized for her comments and retracted her comparisons to the Holocaust.\n\"I made a statement on \u2018The Don Lemon Show\u2019 comparing Trump's attempt to disenfranchise Black and Brown people to the Holocaust. That was a mistake, and I apologize for it. Trump is coming for my community, and I get emotional about it and make strong statements. But that was going too far, and I retract that comparison,\" the statement read.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott's press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, criticized Jones' original comments.\n\"Fleeing Texas House Democrats continue to beclown themselves through this desperate, anti-democratic stunt. Unlike these radicals, Governor Abbott refuses to abandon Texans. If the House Democrats who deserted Texans were serious about delivering results, they would come back to the Texas Capitol and do the job voters elected them to do,\" Mahaleris told Fox News Digital.\nFox News Digital also reached out to the Texas Democratic Party for comment.\nIn the interview with Lemon, Jones also dismissed the argument made by Texas Republicans that she and other Democrats will need to return to the state eventually, remarking she \"ain\u2019t got to do nothing but die.\"\n\"[T]he point is, I will stay gone as long as I need to stay gone. And I hope that my colleagues feel as convicted as I do. That right now, you know, I always wondered what I would have done would I've been walking on\u2026the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Would I have been willing to walk for over a year with the Montgomery bus boycott. And you know what? Now is our civil rights moment, people,\" Jones said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAfter several Democrats failed to return to the Texas State Capitol on Monday afternoon, Texas Speaker of the House Dustin Burrows announced he would sign arrest warrants against any absent Democrat lawmakers if authorized by a vote of the chamber. Abbott then swiftly called on the Texas Department of Public Safety to arrest the \"delinquent Texas House Democrats.\"\nAbbott has also threatened to expel the Texas House Democrats for leaving the state.\nFox News' Alec Schemmel contributed to this report."
