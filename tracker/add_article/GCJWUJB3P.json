      "summary": "Elon Musk has declared that roughly 80% of Tesla’s future value will come from its humanoid robot, Optimus, even though the bot remains in early development and could take years to deploy at scale. Tesla’s Master Plan Part IV frames Optimus as a key AI‑powered product that could transform labor by automating repetitive or dangerous tasks in factories and homes. Musk envisions thousands of Optimus units working alongside humans at Tesla plants, with a projected unit cost of $20,000–$30,000, while the company faces stiff competition from other robotics firms such as Boston Dynamics, Figure, and Robotera.",
