      "feedback": "To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, enhance the depth and clarity of reasoning by explicitly articulating the causal chain between the Fed's potential policy shifts and their direct impact on market dynamics, particularly in the technology and retail sectors. Integrate first-principles grounding by referencing key economic indicators such as inflation rates, employment figures, and real rate differentials to substantiate claims about the structural regime shift. Ensure specificity by detailing potential catalysts, such as the Jackson Hole meeting outcomes and the September jobs report, while quantifying risks with ranges or probabilities where applicable. Increase citation density by directly linking statements to specific sources, ensuring all critical sources are covered and conflicts reconciled. Finally, refine the conclusion to clearly delineate the base case scenario, key risks, and what to watch, while expressing confidence levels in a more nuanced manner.",
