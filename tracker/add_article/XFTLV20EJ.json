      "summary": "Galvanize Therapeutics has enrolled its first patient in the PROPEL Registry, a multicenter observational study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of its Aliya Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) ablation system for soft tissue lesions in organs such as lung and liver. The Aliya PEF system uses short, high‑voltage electrical pulses to ablate tumors without damaging surrounding structures, preserving extracellular matrix and potentially stimulating immune responses. The registry will enroll up to 1,000 patients across 50 U.S. centers, following them for up to 24 months to capture procedural data, peri‑operative outcomes, and radiographic responses. By systematically collecting real‑world evidence, Galvanize aims to inform evidence‑based integration of its PEF technology into clinical care pathways and expand treatment options for patients with complex or previously irradiated lesions.",
