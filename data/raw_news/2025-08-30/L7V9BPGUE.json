  "content": "Stats Show Shocking Surge In Attacks On Churches In America\n\n            Authored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,\n\nIn 2024, the United States witnessed a significant uptick in acts of hostility targeting churches, with a total of 436 documented incidents\u2014a sharp increase from 315 in 2023 and nearly double the 230 reported in 2022.\n\n\n\nThis data, compiled by the Family Research Council (FRC), highlights a troubling trend amid broader societal shifts, including a decline in regular religious attendance from 42% to 30% over the past two decades, according to Gallup polls.\n\nThe incidents spanned a wide range of hostile actions across 43 states. Vandalism was the most prevalent, accounting for 284 cases that included property destruction, defacement, burglary, and ransacking.\n\n\nNEW: Data from the Family Research Council shows a stunning surge of attacks on churches in America.\nWow. Churches are under siege.\nInstances of hostility [including vandalism] against U.S. churches are skyrocketing:\n2024: 415 incidents\n2023: 485 incidents\n2018\u20132021 combined:\u2026 pic.twitter.com/CDOCpA76Wo\n\u2014 The Vigilant Fox \ud83e\udd8a (@VigilantFox) August 29, 2025\nArson followed with 55 events, encompassing both confirmed attempts and fires of uncertain origin, occasionally linked to individuals struggling with mental health.\n\nGun-related incidents surged to 28, more than doubling from 12 the previous year, involving threats, brandishing during services, and actual shootings. Bomb threats numbered 14, primarily hoaxes delivered via calls or emails.\n\n\nJUST RELEASED: New edition of our Hostility Against Churches Report\nFamily Research Council identified 415 hostile incidents in 2024, affecting a total of 383 churches.\n\ud83d\udd17 https://t.co/publ8N7JZd\n/1 pic.twitter.com/MU85K2upsg\n\u2014 Family Research Council (@FRCdc) August 11, 2025\nAdditionally, 47 other violent acts were recorded, such as assaults during church break-ins, exemplified by an event at Zion Baptist Church in Kentucky. Geographically, California led with 40 incidents, followed by Pennsylvania at 29, and Florida and New York tied at 25 each.\n\nMotives behind these acts varied widely, from unknown causes and financial theft (like stealing copper wiring) to political disagreements on issues like sexuality, and even juvenile pranks.\n\nNotably, pro-abortion motivations dropped dramatically to just 2 incidents, compared to 59 in 2022 following the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nHostility related to LGBT issues persisted at 33 cases, a slight decrease from 42 in 2023, while satanic motives fell to 1 from 12 the prior year.\n\nThe FRC, which has been tracking these incidents, has itself been designated as an anti-LGBT hate group by the leftist Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nAs religious landscapes evolve, these findings underscore ongoing challenges to places of worship in America.\n\nThe findings come in the wake of a horrific shooting at a Catholic Church school in Minneapolis.\n\n\n\nYour support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.
