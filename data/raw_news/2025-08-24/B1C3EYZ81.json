The following customization options are available for the report:\n-\nDetailed Volume Analysis\n-\nCriss-Cross segment analysis (e.g. Product X Application)\n-\nCompetitive Product Benchmarking\n-\nGeographic Analysis\n-\nAdditional countries in any of the regions\n-\nCustomized Data Representation\n-\nDetailed analysis and profiling of additional market players\nAn accurate research report requires proper strategizing as well as implementation. There are multiple factors involved in the completion of good and accurate research report and selecting the best methodology to compete the research is the toughest part. Since the research reports we provide play a crucial role in any company\u2019s decision-making process, therefore we at SNS Insider always believe that we should choose the best method which gives us results closer to reality. This allows us to reach at a stage wherein we can provide our clients best and accurate investment to output ratio.\nEach report that we prepare takes a timeframe of 350-400 business hours for production. Starting from the selection of titles through a couple of in-depth brain storming session to the final QC process before uploading our titles on our website we dedicate around 350 working hours. The titles are selected based on their current market cap and the foreseen CAGR and growth.\nThe 5 steps process:\nStep 1: Secondary Research:\nSecondary Research or Desk Research is as the name suggests is a research process wherein, we collect data through the readily available information. In this process we use various paid and unpaid databases which our team has access to and gather data through the same. This includes examining of listed companies\u2019 annual reports, Journals, SEC filling etc. Apart from this our team has access to various associations across the globe across different industries. Lastly, we have exchange relationships with various university as well as individual libraries.\nStep 2: Primary Research\nWhen we talk about primary research, it is a type of study in which the researchers collect relevant data samples directly, rather than relying on previously collected data. This type of research is focused on gaining content specific facts that can be sued to solve specific problems. Since the collected data is fresh and first hand therefore it makes the study more accurate and genuine.\nWe at SNS Insider have divided Primary Research into 2 parts.\nPart 1 wherein we interview the KOLs of major players as well as the upcoming ones across various geographic regions. This allows us to have their view over the market scenario and acts as an important tool to come closer to the accurate market numbers. As many as 45 paid and unpaid primary interviews are taken from both the demand and supply side of the industry to make sure we land at an accurate judgement and analysis of the market.\nThis step involves the triangulation of data wherein our team analyses the interview transcripts, online survey responses and observation of on filed participants. The below mentioned chart should give a better understanding of the part 1 of the primary interview.\nPart 2: In this part of primary research the data collected via secondary research and the part 1 of the primary research is validated with the interviews from individual consultants and subject matter experts.\nConsultants are those set of people who have at least 12 years of experience and expertise within the industry whereas Subject Matter Experts are those with at least 15 years of experience behind their back within the same space. The data with the help of two main processes i.e., FGDs (Focused Group Discussions) and IDs (Individual Discussions). This gives us a 3rd party nonbiased primary view of the market scenario making it a more dependable one while collation of the data pointers.\nStep 3: Data Bank Validation\nOnce all the information is collected via primary and secondary sources, we run that information for data validation. At our intelligence centre our research heads track a lot of information related to the market which includes the quarterly reports, the daily stock prices, and other relevant information. Our data bank server gets updated every fortnight and that is how the information which we collected using our primary and secondary information is revalidated in real time.\nStep 4: QA/QC Process\nAfter all the data collection and validation our team does a final level of quality check and quality assurance to get rid of any unwanted or undesired mistakes. This might include but not limited to getting rid of the any typos, duplication of numbers or missing of any important information. The people involved in this process include technical content writers, research heads and graphics people. Once this process is completed the title gets uploader on our platform for our clients to read it.\nStep 5: Final QC/QA Process:\nThis is the last process and comes when the client has ordered the study. In this process a final QA/QC is done before the study is emailed to the client. Since we believe in giving our clients a good experience of our research studies, therefore, to make sure that we do not lack at our end in any way humanly possible we do a final round of quality check and then dispatch the study to the client."
