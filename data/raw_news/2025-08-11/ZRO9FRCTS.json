  "description": "Nvidia and Broadcom supplier Lam Research breaks out into buy range.",
  "content": "Led by Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), 10 stocks from the broad semiconductor sector etched a spot on this month's list of new buys by the best mutual funds. And while Nvidia and Broadcom grab much of Wall Street's focus, chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) has just launched a new breakout into a buy range.\n\nLam Research also joins Nvidia and Broadcom on two other elite lists. In addition to both making Investor's Business Daily's Big Cap 20, both have earned a spot on the IBD Leaderboard.\n\nBased in Fremont, Calif., Lam Research supplies wafer fabrication equipment to the major players in the semiconductor industry, including Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nWith a stellar 98 Composite Rating, it ranks No. 1 among its peers in the semiconductor equipment group. KLA (KLAC), which also made the latest list of new buys by top funds, hails from the same industry.\n\nIncluding its latest report on July 30, Lam Research has posted average earnings growth of 39.6% over the last three quarters. Sales growth during that time accelerated from 16% to 34%. Revenue came in at over $5.1 billion in the latest fiscal quarter.\n\nIn the latest report on new buys by the best mutual funds, Lam Research took in $12.32 billion in capital inflows.\n\nIn another sign of demand, the stock earns a 1.3 up/down volume ratio. For that metric, any number above 1.0 points to demand.\n\nShowing its high-quality institutional sponsorship, an impressive 257 funds with an A+ rating from IBD own shares of Lam Research stock.\n\nSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Are Buying\n\nWhile Nvidia and Broadcom continue to notch new highs, Lam Research has just cleared a handle entry. It now trades within a 102.59 \u2013 107.72 buy zone.\n\nThe handle can be interpreted as part of a giant cup-with-handle base on a weekly chart. As the stock crafted the handle, the relative strength line has turned higher, a positive sign of market leadership.\n\nInvestors can also view Lam Research as approaching the 20% profit goal from a smaller and early stage cup-with-handle entry of 86.04.\n\nFollow Matthew Galgani on X (formerly Twitter) at @IBD_MGalgani.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nTop Funds Pour More Money Into This Stock Than Into Nvidia, Palantir\n\nSee Which Stocks Just Came On \u2013 And Off \u2013 IBD Stock Lists",
