  "title": "This Samsung tablet is better than any gaming handheld I've ever tried",
  "description": "Could tablets be the future of portable gaming?",
  "content": "Portable gaming is on the rise again, long after the golden era of the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS back in the noughties. While the Nintendo Switch was released back in 2017, that was a hybrid device that could also function as a living-room console; the real piece of kit that revived gaming on the go was Valve's Steam Deck, which hit shelves in February 2022.\n\nEver since, countless PC gaming handhelds have cropped up - and continue to do so, with the ROG Xbox Ally premiering at Gamescom 2025. Alongside some of the new devices at the latest gaming trade show, I also stumbled across the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, which, I'll freely admit, I initially dismissed.\n\nAs I peered over the shoulder of someone else testing it out on the showfloor - because my curiosity got the best of me - the graphics looked phenomenal. So I had to sit down and try it out for myself, and while my expectations were low, they were very quickly blown out of the water.\n\nThe title loaded up to demo the gaming tablet was the free-to-play gacha game Genshin Impact. Now, while this is hardly a super-demanding game in terms of graphics, picking such a colourful game was certainly the right choice to show off how fantastic this AMOLED display is. At 14.6 inches, the display is much larger than any currently available gaming handhelds.\n\nI continued to run around in-game to see if the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra\u2019s performance was as good as its display. The whole time I was playing, I didn\u2019t face any issues with performance. No lag, no stuttering, and no visual glitches whatsoever. I was able to experience smooth, non-stop gameplay thanks to the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ CPU.\n\nWhile this is, of course, a mobile-first chip, the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ CPU is powerful enough to be comparable to some desktop-class processors. I wasn\u2019t able to monitor framerates since this was just a demo session, but the performance I was getting was extremely promising.\n\nPair this with the healthy 16GB of RAM contained inside the tablet, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is gunning for the best gaming laptops. I was genuinely blown away with the experience I was having with this tablet, and it\u2019s not actually a dedicated gaming tablet like the Asus ROG Flow Z13, but it still delivers excellent performance.\n\nAnother factor that seriously sets the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra apart is how thin it is. At just 5.4mm thick, you never have to worry about whether it'll fit in your bag, and at 718g, it won't weigh you down either. By comparison, most gaming handhelds are fairly chunky.\n\nThe one let-down of gaming on a tablet is being limited in your controls, having only a touchscreen at your disposal. However, pair this with one of the best mobile gaming controllers for phones or tablets, and you\u2019ve even got yourself the ergonomics and inputs of a gaming handheld. Alternatively, get yourself one of the best wireless mice and a Bluetooth keyboard to pair with it, and you have an ultra-portable laptop that you can game on.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra was plugged in during my entire demo session, so I wasn\u2019t able to actually monitor the battery life, which could be an issue - in our review, we noted that the battery life was a bit lackluster, with about 9 hours of use off a single charge (and probably less if you're gaming, too). That being said, it still annihilates any handheld gaming PC; the 80Wh battery in the MSI Claw will only last you around two hours on average.\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra was absolutely amazing, and while previously I\u2019ve turned my nose up at tablets when it comes to gaming, this demo session has really changed my perspective.\n\nMy experience was better than many gaming handhelds that are on the market right now, and with so many games now gaining popularity on mobile platforms, including Resident Evil: Survival Unit and Call of Duty Mobile, investing in a high-quality tablet that you can not only game on but also use as a regular productivity device might be a great option for you.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 The best tablets in 2025\n\u2022 Huawei\u2019s new MatePad has got me thinking: where are all the good cheap tablets?",

      "text": "The best wireless keyboards in 2025\nExperience cable-free typing and button-mashing with the best wireless keyboards\nThe best wireless keyboards are key if you want to live a tangle-free existence or have a cleaner, more minimalist looking setup. If you\u2019re tired of dealing with cables and detangling them, getting a wireless keyboard will minimize the amount of wires you have to deal with.\nOf course, if you\u2019re worried about performance, you don't have to. Wireless keyboards have come a long way over the last few years. They are much more reliable than in the past, touting a longer range, lower latency, and a more reliable connection \u2013 not to mention impressively long battery life. And, the best ones are as accurate and responsive as their wired counterparts, even making it to our best keyboards list. Some of the wireless gaming keyboards even come with features like RGB lighting.\nSo, no matter if you\u2019re on your gaming PC or getting down to business, you should consider one of the best wireless keyboards on this list. Whether you want to live tangle-free or have a cleaner, more minimalist looking setup, it should do the trick. And, no matter what you choose, you should pair it with one of the best wireless mice.\nThe best wireless keyboard overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nChoosing the best peripherals isn\u2019t just about finding the best looking one. The Cherry Stream Desktop is proof of this, and while it might look like it time-traveled from the Aughts or the late 90s, this wireless keyboard is the most compelling choice out there overall.\nExtremely affordable, comfortable to use, and easy to set up, we found this keyboard from Cherry to be a pleasure to type on because of its incredibly responsive performance and satisfying tactile feedback. It\u2019s a bit sparse on special features, but it also makes up for that with the wireless mouse it comes bundled with. Both utilize one USB wireless receiver, which means you\u2019re not only saving money, you\u2019re also hitting two birds with one single port.\nRead our full Cherry Stream Desktop review\nThe best budget wireless keyboard\n2. Logitech K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe\u2019ve been using the Logitech K380 as our go-to work keyboard for months now, and we can honestly say that it\u2019s one of the best keyboards out there for writers, digital nomads, and folks who spend most of their time pounding away. But, even if you\u2019re not always typing on your computer, the fact that it\u2019s very cheaply priced for what it offers also makes it a fantastic choice for you.\nAdding to its value, it also comes with features like multi-device connectivity (specifically, up to three) and multi-platform compatibility. You can even toggle from one device to another with just a press of a button for the ultimate productivity if you\u2019re multitasking. That\u2019s without mentioning its super sleek and portable form factor, which makes it not just travel-ready, but also travel-friendly. We only wish Logitech made it rechargeable, but with a 24-month battery life, this missing piece is hardly a deal-breaker.\nThe best quiet wireless keyboard\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Razer Pro Type Ultra delivers that satisfying tactile feedback without the unnecessarily loud click-clacking that's not completely appropriate in an office setting, thanks to its silent and linear mechanical keys. Of course, this being a Razer keyboard, it also comes fully-loaded with features with three connectivity options, multi-device connectivity, and a luxurious wrist pad to keep your wrists comfortable. Due to the added height of the keys, we found our wrists bending upward, but that's exactly what the wrist pad is for.\nif you don't feel like having to charge every time the battery runs out, you can naturally go wired. Not that you would have to constantly worry about that since it's got up to 214 hours of battery life on Bluetooth and up to 207 hours when using the 2.4GHz dongle. The Razer Pro Type Ultra may be expensive, but it's completely worth the price.\nRead our full Razer Pro Type Ultra review\nThe best low-profile wireless keyboard\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWireless gaming keyboards, like wine, have gotten better with age, and the best example of that is the Razer Deathstalker V2 Pro, the first in Razer's new line of low-profile gaming keyboards. With three connectivity options: Bluetooth, USB wired, and 2.4GHz wireless, a full-key programmable design, and up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge, this wireless keyboard is nothing short of impressive.\nIt's also incredibly comfortable to type on, whether you're gaming or seeing yourself through a full day's worth of emails. Its optical switches are fast, accurate, and satisfying to use. And, its short travel distance of 2.8mm and short actuation of 1.2mm (if you get the linear optical version) only enhances your experience.\nIt may be a bit of a late comer in the low-profile scene, but it's muscling its way into this form factor market with impressive specs nonetheless. Whatever it is you need a wireless keyboard for, you can't go wrong with it.\nRead our full Razer Deathstalker V2 Pro review\nThe best TKL wireless keyboard\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLogitech G\u2019s G915 TKL Lightspeed keyboard is one of the best looking keyboards we\u2019ve ever used, touting a sleek and incredibly slim deck and even thinner floating keys. That\u2019s without mentioning its cool volume wheel and unique round keys for connectivity and media controls.\nIt doesn\u2019t just go by looks alone, however. Its performance and feature set are just as impressive, rocking an actuation distance of 1.5 mm, long wireless range, and low latency. Rounding those off are its onboard memory that lets you save two lighting and three macro profiles, a battery life rating of 40 hours when its RGB is at 100% brightness, and its Game Mode button that disables the Windows key. And, while it\u2019s compact, it doesn\u2019t completely abandon its special and arrow keys. In other words, what you\u2019ve got here is a wireless keyboard that\u2019s just as great for productivity as it is for gaming, whether you\u2019re on-the-go or at your desk.\nRead our full Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed review\nThe best mini wireless keyboard\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere are quite a few impressive mini keyboards that recently hit the shelves, but only a handful deliver wireless connectivity and fewer still do so impressively. If we were to list the best mini keyboards with wireless connectivity, then the Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini Hyperspeed would be sitting at the very top.\nDespite its size, this new release from Razer more than punches above its weight, touting an incredibly robust build, vibrant RGB lighting, and satisfying tactile feedback. Go with Razer\u2019s yellow switches, and you\u2019ll also get a quieter typing experience without sacrificing your comfort. But, what\u2019s truly impressive about this wireless keyboard is its connectivity. Offering both USB wireless and Bluetooth connections, it not only boasts an impressively long wireless range, but also zero discernable latency (much like its full-sized brother, the BlackWidow V3 Pro). That\u2019s even when you\u2019re in one room with the keyboard and the computer it\u2019s connected to is in another. That\u2019s already impressive in its own right, but given the competition, that\u2019s really saying something.\nRead our full Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini Hyperspeed review\nThe best wireless keyboard for Mac\n7. Apple Magic Keyboard\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWho are we kidding? The best wireless keyboard for Apple\u2019s Macs and MacBooks is the actual wireless keyboard Apple specifically designed for them. Now touting the company\u2019s scissor switches, the Magic Keyboard is aptly named, as the experience of typing on it may be bordering a magical experience.\nIt\u2019s true there\u2019s not really a lot of features here. Very much an Apple product, this one focuses more on form and function, and not as much on features. There\u2019s still much to love, however. It pairs incredibly easily with an Apple computer, and it\u2019s among the thinnest and most compact keyboards we\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of using. And, if you plan on investing in the new iMac 24-inch, you can even get it in the same shade (of which there are six on top of the usual silver). Unfortunately, you can only get these colors if you purchase the matching AIO, but here\u2019s to hoping Apple will make them available for individual purchase.\nThe best wireless keyboard for productivity\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFrom the moment you start using it, it's clear that the Logitech Signature K650 wireless keyboard has been built for productivity. It comes with a bunch of excellent time-saving features that will complement your workflow, yet its wallet-friendly price of $49.99/\u00a349.99 makes it affordable for almost any budget.\nChief among these features is the modified row of function keys. While they retain their normal uses (albeit as secondary features), their main abilities are to run various pre-programmed shortcuts. You can open or close a browser tab, refresh your web browser, launch the emoji picker, mute or unmute your microphone, and much more. Instead of having to fumble around with your mouse looking for these on-screen controls, you can just save yourself time by pressing the keyboard's shortcut buttons.\nAnd there's more to it than just that. There are plenty of connectivity options, a comfortable typing experience, solid battery life, and you can even switch between Windows and macOS key layouts if you use both operating systems. We weren't particularly convinced by the wrist rest, but it's only a minor concern on what is otherwise a really strong keyboard.\nRead our full Logitech Signature K650 review\nHow to choose the best wireless keyboard for you\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nChoosing the best wireless keyboard is just a little more involved than choosing a traditional wired keyboard. You have to account for reliability, accuracy, ergonomics, and build, of course. But, you must also ensure that the one you're choosing comes with fast and solid connectivity, whether it uses 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth (or both). You have to check the range, of course, but having very low latency is much more important.\nAnother important factor is battery life. Know that not all wireless keyboards come with a rechargeable battery so if it's important to you to have it, be sure to check if your choice comes with one. Naturally, check just how many hours you're getting on a single charge as well. Some offer long battery life, some you do have to charge constantly. If you are ok with getting a non-rechargeable model, however, it's likely to offer a much longer battery life of up to one or two years.\nHow we test keyboards\nTesting keyboards is a serious matter. After all, it is your main interface for interacting with your PC or laptop, and many people use it all day long for work and play. That means that not only does it have to be reliable and to perform well, but it has to also be comfortable and satisfying to use.\nEach keyboard that lands on our desks is treated and utilized as our main keyboard for a week or more. That's the best way to ensure that we're not only experiencing it the way consumers would in the real world, but also coming across any quirks, flaws, and issues.\nWe take a look at its design and ergonomics, ensuring that they don't cause finger, wrist, and shoulder fatigue but rather prevent it. If compact, we also test out just how travel-friendly or ideal for small setups they are. If a keyboard has additional features, we test those out as well, checking how effective and useful they are.\nWhen it comes to wireless keyboards, we take a closer look at the connection, whether it's 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth. We take a look at just how reliable and solid that connection is, whether there are discernible lags, and what its range is. Finally, we take everything we've learned and compare them with the keyboard's price to gauge if it is a great value and worth recommending.\nAre wireless keyboards good for gaming?\nIn short: yes. Many wireless keyboards are perfect for gaming \u2013 just look at our five-star review of the Alienware Pro Wireless for proof.\nYou might be concerned that wireless connections aren't as solid as using a cable, and it's true that linking your keyboard to your PC using Bluetooth can lead to increased latency. If you're a professional gamer, that's best avoided, but it's probably less of an issue for casual gamers. Even so, many wireless keyboards come with an included USB dongle that wirelessly connects to your PC instead of using Bluetooth, so you can just stick with that and enjoy a rock-solid connection that is perfect for gaming and just as effective as anything wired.\nAs well as that, using a wireless keyboard and its lack of a lengthy cable means less clutter on your desk, which in turn means fewer objects that your mouse (or its own cable) could bump into. During a fast-paced gaming session, that could make all the difference to your gameplay effectiveness.\nWhat are the main disadvantages of wireless keyboards?\nWhile wireless keyboards can be an excellent option, they do come with some disadvantages. For one thing, relying on Bluetooth connectivity can lead to slight increases in latency, as we mentioned above. To many people this might not be noticeable, but you'll want to steer clear of that if you're aiming to get serious about gaming.\nElsewhere, you'll also have to deal with the issue of battery life. While a wired keyboard can go on indefinitely, wireless keyboards will eventually need to be charged up or have their batteries replaced. Luckily, you should be able to keep using your keyboard as it's charging, but it's still something to bear in mind.\nAnd because of the extra connectivity tech packed inside them, wireless keyboards often cost a little more than their wired siblings. The difference is not normally enormous, but it can be noticeable.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMichelle Rae Uy is the former Computing Reviews and Buying Guides Editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "I didn\u2019t think 4K gaming handhelds were possible, but this DIY Nvidia RTX 4090 model has proved me wrong\n- A new video on YouTube shows a DIY handheld gaming PC using an Nvidia RTX 4090 gaming laptop GPU\n- It features a 4K 60Hz display, 64GB of RAM, and 4TB of storage space\n- It's a sign that handheld gaming PCs could be more powerful than current mainstream models are\nNvidia's RTX 5000 series GPUs remain in the spotlight after their launch in January, with Super model GPUs expected to arrive later this year. However, the previous generation's laptop GPUs have been utilized in an unexpected way \u2013 and it points to the possibility of more powerful portable gaming.\nAs reported by Notebookcheck, NITTRX has showcased a DIY custom handheld gaming PC on YouTube, running multiple triple-A games at 4K on high settings, utilizing an RTX 4090 laptop GPU. Yes, you read that right \u2013 and it's working alongside Intel's Core i9 14900HX, a powerful 24-core and 32-thread processor.\nNow, that may instantly raise some red flags concerning thermals, battery life, and power consumption, but as the screenshot shows below, there's adequate cooling; the RTX 4090 laptop GPU temperature mostly remains at 162F / 72C, while the CPU fluctuates between 151F and 158F, or 66C and 70C.\nHaving tested a decent number of handheld gaming PCs from MSI, Lenovo, and Asus, I can say that the thermal performance of this DIY handheld is very similar to that of the mainstream devices. This is all while housing 4TB of storage via two 2TB SSDs and 64GB of RAM via two 32GB sticks \u2013 all of which should contribute to higher temperatures, but those temperatures are nowhere near what would be considered excessive.\nIt's also worth noting that this handheld is using a Dell 12.5-inch 4K 60Hz display (specifically the Sharp LQ125D1), but frame rates reaching triple digits in game tests truly show what the RTX 4090 laptop GPU is capable of. Great performance is achievable on current handhelds using AMD APUs and Intel SoCs, but this is possibly the best handheld gaming PC you'll see for a while.\nThis shows that it's no longer a matter of whether or not 4K handheld gaming is possible. It's now a matter of whether handheld gaming PC manufacturers are willing to make the leap and design more powerful handheld gaming PCs, which would likely target a niche audience, depending on pricing.\nAnalysis: These are the handhelds that should have premium prices, not the new AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme models\nI've been fairly vocal about my frustration with handheld gaming PCs and the sudden spike in their pricing, without much of a performance leap over previous hardware to justify it. We're seeing this happen with the new MSI Claw A8 pushing close to $1,000, despite early benchmarks suggesting a minimal 10% performance increase in games using AMD\u2019s new Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, compared to the Ryzen Z1 Extreme.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe only handhelds with potential high price tags that can be justified are the Ayaneo Flip 1S DS, which uses AMD's powerful AMD's Ryzen AI HX 370 processor; the Lenovo Legion Go 2, mostly due to the addition of an OLED screen; and of course, this custom-made RTX 4090 handheld.\nUnfortunately, I don't see any of the mainstream handheld gaming PC manufacturers getting any ideas from this DIY setup. Producing such devices would require plenty of durability tests, and the resulting handhelds would essentially rival gaming laptops on a larger scale.\nA 12.5-inch display is also undesirable, which I've previously stated regarding the Acer Nitro Blaze 11 \u2013 and I still hold that opinion about this DIY device, although it's far more tolerable given the hardware and the available resolution.\nI'd love to see a device like this be replicated by a mainstream manufacturer \u2013 and if there's anything we should take away from this DIY project, it's that 4K handheld gaming isn't impossible after all.\nYou might also like...\n- No, the ROG Xbox Ally won't launch during Gamescom \u2013 a new leak suggests its actual launch date is further away than we thought\n- Nvidia is reportedly slashing RTX 5000 series GPU prices \u2013 but I'm expecting scalpers to ruin our fun\n- Buckle up, MSI \u2013 the Lenovo Legion Go 2 looks set to outperform the Claw A8, based on new benchmarks\nIsaiah is a Staff Writer for the Computing channel at TechRadar.

We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best gaming laptop overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the very best gaming experience on a laptop: Packed with cutting-edge mobile gaming technology, this laptop is an absolute beast that will play the latest PC games with ease.\n\u2705 You want something to take to work: The powerful components mean this is also a great workstation laptop, and thanks to its subtle and classy design, you could take this into the office without raising eyebrows.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: Razer doesn't make budget devices, and while for the high asking price for the Blade 16 you get incredible performance, there are some great affordable alternatives out there.\n\u274c You value portability: The Razer Blade 16 is impressively thin for a gaming laptop, but the 16-inch screen does mean that this isn't the easiest laptop to lug around.\nRazer's iconic gaming laptop is back for 2025 and better than ever. We reviewed the high-end model with Nvidia's mighty RTX 5090 laptop GPU, and we were blown away by the performance, with the Razer Blade 16 easily handling anything we threw at it. This included playing games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2 at their highest settings. With help from Nvidia's DLSS and Multi Frame Generation (MFG) features, we got Alan Wake 2, a graphically-intensive game, running at around 200fps (frames per second) - an incredible result. Meanwhile Cyberpunk 2077, one of the best looking games of recent times, hit a whopping 217fps even with ray tracing set to max. Basically, you'll be able to play any game at its highest settings for a long, long time to come.\nThe design of the Razer Blade 16 (2025) is stunning, with a sleek thin and light design that puts other gaming laptops to shame. Build quality is excellent, and while there's no 4K option for the display, at 16-inches with a 240Hz refresh rate and OLED technology, games look absolutely gorgeous when played - we're still reeling from walking the neon-drenched streets of Cyberpunk 2077's Night City. This all comes at a cost, however, with the Blade 16 starting at a rather intimidating $2,999.99 / \u00a32,699.99 / AU$4,899.95, which means it simply won't be an option for a lot of people. If that's the case, read on for some much more affordable gaming laptop picks that will still provide an excellent gaming experience. However, if you have the money and want the very best gaming laptop that's on sale right now, then the Razer Blade 16 (2025) is the laptop to get.\nRead the full Razer Blade 16 (2025) review\nTake a look at our Razer discount codes for the best Razer offers and savings.\n\ud83d\udcbb The Razer Blade 16 (2025) delivers power and style in spades, offering best-in-class performance in games and even managing to hold its own as a day-to-day work laptop thanks to the improved battery life. Nvidia RTX 5000 GPU options bring DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation to the party, and some small but smart design tweaks from the previous model help make this an even better high-end laptop. Read the full review: Razer Blade 16 (2025)\nThe best affordable gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re a competitive gamer: The RTX 4050 GPU and 165Hz refresh rate are great for eSports.\n\u2705 You're on a tight-ish budget: You won\u2019t spend a lot to get decent gaming performance, especially at 1080p.\n\u274c You value portability: This is one very bulky gaming laptop.\n\u274c You\u2019re tired of the 'gamer' aesthetic: A lot of great laptops have dated, 'gamer' designs, but this one is a bit more dated than some others.\nWith an outstanding mix of specs, speedy display, and fantastic price for its midrange configuration, the Acer Nitro 16 is one of the best laptops for gaming for those with enough money to do a midrange machine, but only just barely.\nThe Nitro 16 will get you excellent 1080p gaming performance, especially thanks to a speedy 165Hz display that makes it perfect for esports and other competitive titles. Not a lot of gaming laptops for under $1,500/\u00a31,500/AU$2,100 can say that.\nStill, there are trade-offs, and the more aggressive 'gamer' design on the Nitro 16 really could have used more innovation rather than stick with what gaming laptops have been doing for the past several years. It's webcam isn't great either, and it's a rather bulky machine to the point where it might have been a desktop replacement if it had better specs. Still, if you're looking just past the 'budget' horizon for your next gaming laptop, this is an excellent choice.\nRead the full Acer Nitro 16 review\n\ud83d\udcbb The Acer Nitro 16 offers solid gaming performance at a budget-friendly price, featuring a 165Hz refresh rate and a robust keyboard with RGB backlighting. While it does not excel in aesthetics and is somewhat bulky, its overall functionality and affordability make it a commendable choice for competitive gamers on a budget. Read the full review: Acer Nitro 16\nThe best premium gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best-designed gaming laptop money can buy: The Alienware 16 Area-51 is one gorgeous-looking gaming laptop with an exceptional build quality.\n\u2705 You want premium gaming performance: The Alienware 16 Area-51 comes with some of the most powerful mobile components you can get in 2025, offering excellent gaming performance no matter what title you're playing.\n\u274c You want the best screen: The Alienware 16 Area-51's screen isn't the best out there, with colors sometimes looking washed out. If screen quality is essential, check out the Razer Blade 16 (2025) above, which is our pick as the best gaming laptop overall.\n\u274c You want long battery life: Most gaming laptops offer poor battery lives due to the powerful components they use, and sadly the Alienware 16 Area-51 is no different. There are gaming laptops out there that offer better battery life, so if that's important look elsewhere.\nAlienware has a fine reputation for creating gorgeous gaming laptops that don't just look great, they are also packed with cutting-edge hardware, and the Alienware 16 Area-51 continues this fine tradition - in fact, we'd say this is the best gaming laptop Alienware has ever made, and that's high praise indeed.\nIn our review we highlighted the design, especially the multi-zone customizable lighting, smart port placement, clever ventilation, and clear glass panel on the bottom to show of the internals as particularly impressive. The mechanical keyboard feels amazing to play on (as well as work on), and gaming performance in general was incredibly impressive, with demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong, Forza Motorsport (2023), and Doom: The Dark Ages all easily hitting over 60fps at their highest settings.\nThis results in the best premium gaming laptop your money can buy. Speaking of which, with a price starting at $1,999.99 / \u00a32,149.01 / AU$4,198.70, this is an expensive laptop, especially if you go for one of the higher configurations.\nThere are some flaws, however. There's no escaping the fact that the screen quality is a tad disappointing, with colors failing to 'pop' as much as more vibrant screens found in some gaming laptops. Battery life is also disappointingly short at just over three hours, but that is par for the course for gaming laptops, sadly.\nRead the full Alienware 16 Area-51 review\n\ud83d\udcbb The Alienware 16 Area-51 stands out with an eye-catching design that sets a tough standard for competitors. Underneath, it delivers impressive gaming performance, an excellent keyboard, and capable speakers. While the 240Hz display offers fast refresh rates, the overall image quality doesn\u2019t quite live up to expectations, and battery life during non-gaming use is lackluster. Read the full review: Alienware 16 Area-51\nThe best budget gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want good 1080p performance: This laptop is more than capable of playing the latest PC games at full HD.\n\u2705 You\u2019re looking for your first gaming laptop: While not the most stylish, its performance is ideal for first-time buyers.\n\u274c You want the best of the best: With the entry-level specs, don't expect to get top-tier performance.\n\u274c You care about portability: This laptop is a bit on the heavy side, so don't expect to carry it around much.\nThe MSI Katana 15 brings accessible 1080p gaming in a laptop, especially for those not keen on spending over $1,000 for a gaming device. Resembling the bold designs of pre-pandemic gaming laptops, it focuses on essential gaming performance. It's a top choice for budget gamers, despite some style and battery compromises. Priced starting at $999, it features a 13th-Gen Intel Core i7, 16GB of RAM, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, and a 1TB SSD, outperforming similarly priced laptops with older specs.\nAlternatives like the Acer Nitro 5, with slightly older components, offer cheaper but less powerful options. The MSI Katana 15 also has pricier versions, with the highest model at $1,899, offering an Intel Core i9, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 4070, though still limited to a 1080p display. Configurations vary by region, with different processor generations and price points.\nDespite its bulk and dated design, the Katana 15 prioritizes gaming performance. Its thermal design effectively cools both CPU and GPU. Performance-wise, it impresses, handling demanding games like Control and Far Cry 6 smoothly, with minor adjustments needed for games like Cyberpunk 2077. The Katana 15, while not without its limitations, offers a balanced gaming experience, showcasing how it effectively blends power and affordability.\nRead the full MSI Katana 15 review\n\ud83d\udcbb The MSI Katana 15 provides solid 1080p gaming performance at an affordable price, making it a strong entry-level option for gamers. It features decent specifications for the price but compromises on aspects like battery life and trackpad quality, making it less ideal for portable use. Read the full review: MSI Katana 15 (2023)\nThe best large-screen gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want desktop-level performance, but portable: Sure, the MSI Titan 18 HX AI isn't the most portable laptop, but it beats lugging around a desktop gaming rig, without sacrificing performance.\n\u2705 You want great performance: Performance scores high on every benchmark with high frame rates at highest settings thanks to the cutting-edge components you'll find within.\n\u274c You want something affordable: The MSI Titan 18 HX AI comes with high-end hardware, and that means that the price is also very high. There are plenty of great gaming laptops on this list that are almost half the price.\n\u274c You want to travel lots with your laptop: The MSI Titan 18 HX AI is more portable than a desktop PC, but it's still very large and bulky, so if you want a laptop to game on while travelling, this probably isn't the best choice.\nA while ago, if you wanted the very best gaming experience, you had no option but to buy (or build) a gaming desktop PC, but these days, laptops like the MSI Titan 18 HX AI have proved that you can get desktop-level performance in a reasonably portable laptop form factor.\nThe MSI Titan 18 HX AI offers the most powerful mobile components, with a top-of-the-range Intel Core Ultra 9 200HX series processor, and the Nvidia RTX 5090 laptop GPU with a huge 24GB of GDDR7. While gaming PCs with the desktop version of the 5090 will still be more powerful (the laptop 5090 is a cut-down version), the MSI Titan 18 HX AI will likely out perform the vast majority of gaming PCs. It also features a huge 18-inch display, so even if you don't have it hooked up to a gaming monitor or TV, you're still getting a very immersive experience.\nThat large screen does mean this isn't the most portable of gaming laptops, but even so, it's still far easier to carry around than a gaming PC, making it a great choice for students or people who like to take part in LAN parties and esports. Performance-wise the MSI Titan 18 HX AI delivers in spades, with even graphically-demanding games like Metro: Exodus and Cyberpunk 2077 hitting well over 60fps on their highest settings. Whack on DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation and you can get some fantastic results that fully make use of the 120Hz refresh rate of the large screen. Unfortunately, the ultra-powerful components mean battery life isn't that great - and the price is also very, very high.\nRead the full MSI Titan 18 HX AI review\n\ud83d\udcbb The MSI Titan 18 HX AI isn't your typical gaming laptop. Rather than focusing on portability and good-enough performance, the Titan brings serious power to the table - where it'll stay most of the time. It's not without faults, like loud fans and a touchy trackpad, but when you consider the capabilities of an RTX 5090 paired with a gorgeous 4K display, the MSI Titan 18 HX is easy to recommend as a large-screen desktop replacement if you have the scratch. Read the full review: MSI Titan 18 HX AI\nThe best desktop replacement gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a high refresh rate display: For fast-paced games where reaction speeds can make a big difference to winning or losing, the 240Hz screen on the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W is ideal, especially paired with the RTX 5080 GPU.\n\u2705 You want a laptop that acts as a desktop replacement: Thanks to the powerful components sitting within the portable laptop form factor, the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W is a great desktop replacement laptop that gives you far more portability than a standard PC.\n\u274c You need a laptop with long battery life: Yes, this is a gaming laptop, and yes we're complaining about battery life. The MSI Vector A18 HX A9W, like many on this list, has a very short battery life, so you'll need to plug it in when playing.\n\u274c You want something portable: This laptop isn't just heavy, its 18-inch display means it won't fit in just about any backpack.\nWe fell in love with the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W while reviewing it, mainly thanks to the excellent performance it delivered in some of our favorite games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, and the Resident Evil 4 remake. Making full use of the powerful RTX 5080 GPU, even the most demanding of games hit over 100fps, and with DLSS and Multi Frame Generation turned on, some games were even north of 200fps - giving the 240Hz refresh rate of the screen an opportunity to truly shine.\nBuild quality is excellent, though this is a large gaming laptop, which means it's best suited as a desktop replacement, which gives you gaming PC-like performance in a more portable laptop design, though if you want a gaming laptop that's comfortable to carry around, I recommend you consider the Razer Blade 16 instead.\nOne of the things we loved the most about the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W is the ECO-Silent mode, which is enabled via the MSI Center software. This mode reduces the power sent to components, which in turn lowers their temperatures and minimizes fan noise. Thanks to an excellent set of customization options, including setting whether the ECO-Silent mode sticks to using the less powerful integrated graphics of the AMD Ryzen 9955HX processor, or making use of the RTX 5080 graphics card (which means more power is used, but also gaming performance is much better), the ECO-Silent mode did a fantastic job of reducing fan noise with minimal impact to gaming performance.\nFor people (like me) who get frustrated by gaming laptops that sound like they are about to take off when playing games, the ECO-Silent mode is a real game changer, and an all-too-rare example of a manufacturer's pre-installed software offering genuinely useful tools to improve the experience of the user.\nOn the downside, battery life is short, and it can take a while to fully charge. As a desktop replacement, you'll be wanting to use this while plugged in for the most part, especially as gaming performance drops significantly when just using the battery (a feature that lowers the power sent to the components to maximize the battery life).\nAlso, with the MSI Vector A18 HX A9W starting at $2,999.99 / \u00a33,199 / AU$6,599 for the RTX 5080 model, this is also a very, very expensive machine. You'll not need to buy a new one for many years to come, but that doesn't make that high initial outlay any easier to stomach.\nRead the full MSI Vector A18 HX A9W review\n\ud83d\udcbb The MSI Vector A18 HX A9W is easy for me to recommend to people buying a gaming laptop, with a powerful RTX 5080 mobile GPU acting as the driving force for high-quality gaming. At its native 2560x1600 resolution, it storms through the most demanding triple-A games like Cyberpunk 2077 without much effort. However, it is very expensive, so I know it won't be for everyone. Read the full review: MSI Vector A18 HX A9W\nThe best laptop for video editing and gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a powerful laptop for gaming and creative work: Thanks to the powerful components and excellent desktop-level performance, plus a gorgeous OLED screen, the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i is a brilliant choice for people who want a laptop for not just gaming, but also doing creative work such as photo and video editing.\n\u2705 You want the best-looking display on a gaming laptop: The Lenovo Legion Pro 7i's screen is easily the best you can get on a gaming laptop in 2025 thanks to a stunning OLED panel that makes colors bright and vibrant, HDR support and an incredibly fast 240Hz refresh rate.\n\u274c You have a tight budget: This is another very expensive gaming laptop, and while for the money you're getting cutting-edge components and the best display you'll find on a gaming laptop, it also means this will be out of reach for a lot of people.\n\u274c You want a long battery life: If you want a laptop, even a gaming one, that you can use for long periods of time without needing to plug it in, then this won't be for you. The powerful components and demanding screen tech mean battery life is particularly low.\nSpending a large amount of cash on a new gaming laptop can be hard to justify, but if the laptop, like the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, can also double as a device to work on, those high prices become much easier to swallow.\nThe reason why I've picked the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i as the best laptop for both gaming and working on is in part due to the incredibly powerful components which don't just make playing the very latest AAA games on it a joy, but also means demanding creative projects, like 3D modelling, video editing, and content creation can be completed quickly. If your income depends on completing projects for clients, being able to turn them around more quickly and take on more work could actually mean that buying the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i is a wise investment - and the fact that it can play games is the icing on the cake.\nAnother reason why I think this is the best gaming laptop for also doing creative work in is because of the gorgeous OLED screen with HDR support and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. This means that colors don't just look bright and vibrant, they are also accurate, which can be essential for people working in the creative industry.\nOf course, that OLED screen also makes games look incredible, and the 240Hz refresh rate means that titles feel fast and responsive. Even if you don't need a laptop for creative work, the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i is an excellent gaming laptop that handles the latest games with ease. Our only reservations in the review are the very high price and short battery life.\nRead the full Lenovo Legion Pro 7i review\n\ud83d\udcbb Yes, the battery life of the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i isn't great, but this is a gaming laptop, and a powerful one at that. It can handle just about anything gaming-wise, comes with a gorgeous OLED screen, and has more than enough ports for all your gaming needs. Just be ready to spend quite a good chunk of change on it. Read the full review: Lenovo Legion Pro 7i\nbest gaming laptop: FAQs\nWhat are the best gaming laptop brands?\nThere are several major brands for gaming laptops to look out for from several manufacturers.\nAcer: Acer makes some of the best gaming laptops for those on a budget thanks to its Nitro line, but its Predator brand of gaming laptops are for more high-end and enthusiast users.\nAsus: Asus has a number of gaming laptop brands that are very popular with gamers, including its budget-friendly TUF Gaming brand, its midrange Republic of Gamers (ROG), and its high-end Strix brand.\nDell: Dell has two main gaming brands under two different company names, Dell and Alienware. Dell gaming laptops like it's G-series are more budget-friendly offerings, while Alienware has two major brands, the x-series and m-series, with the former being more midrange, while the latter is more high-end.\nGigabyte: Gigabyte's main gaming brand is its Aorus line of laptops, which can range from budget-friendly to high-end, but it also sells budget gaming laptops under the stand-alone Gigabyte imprint.\nHP: HP currently has two gaming brands, the lower-end Victus series and the high-end Omen line. While Omen laptops can dip into the near budget category, depending on the specs, you won't ever see a Victus laptop loaded with top-of-the-line specs like RTX 4080 GPUs.\nMSI: MSI has been a gaming laptop mainstay almost since the form factor's beginnings, and so it has several gaming laptop brands like its high-end Titan, its midrange Vector, and more affordable Katana and Cyborg laptops.\nOrigin: Origin's main gaming laptop brand is its EON like, but Origin is more of a custom gaming laptop builder, and it is one of the few companies where you can custom-build your laptop, offering many different aesthetics as well.\nRazer: The OG gaming laptop maker, Razer released the original gaming laptop, the Razer Blade, in 2011, and continues to produce different sizes and configurations of the Blade, all of which are generally excellent.\nWhich component matters most for gaming laptops?\nWhile all components play their part in your gaming experience, the GPU is the one component most directly tied to how many frames per second you'll be able to get for a given resolution, so this should be your focus, with RAM and CPU following after, then storage. You won't need more than a 1440p display for the most part, and a 1080p display on a laptop is more than enough for a great gaming experience.\nIs it worth it to get a gaming laptop?\nDefinitely. The gap between gaming PCs and mobile devices has significantly narrowed, as laptops have become both more compact and more powerful. If you're looking for a device that saves space and offers portability, yet still packs enough power to handle everything from less demanding games to the most graphically-intensive titles, one of the top gaming laptops should be on your list.\nAre gaming laptops good for video editing?\nThanks to their powerful dedicated graphics cards, which are often paired with powerful processors and plenty of RAM, gaming laptops make excellent devices for video editing. Nvidia even releases 'Studio' drivers for its laptop graphics cards which focus on creative applications, rather than the usual 'Game Ready' drivers which, as the name suggests, focus on maximizing gaming performance. Many gaming laptops also offer best-in-class displays, often with support for the DCI-P3 wide color gamut for professional-class color accuracy.\nAre gaming laptops as good as desktops?\nA few year's ago the answer to the question of what's better, a gaming laptop or a gaming PC, was pretty clear cut: a gaming PC is the way to go for pure performance. These days, the answer isn't quite as easy thanks to mobile components coming along in leaps and bounds, so you can often find high-end gaming laptops that can beat many desktop PCs. However, gaming desktop PCs remain the most powerful way to play the best PC games, as desktop components still have the edge compared to their laptop counterparts. Gaming PCs also aren't as constrained when it comes to cooling, as you can fit in more fans and liquid cooling loops into the larger designs - which also benefit from better airflow. Because gaming laptops need to be relatively thin and light, keeping components cool under load is more tricky. Desktop PCs can also be cheaper, and due to their modular nature they are easier to upgrade when the time comes. However, gaming laptops are better for people who need flexibility and portability as they are much easier to carry around. Check out our guide to the best gaming PCs for our pick of the ultimate gaming rigs.\nHow to choose the best gaming laptop for you\n1080p: Nvidia RTX 5050/5060 or AMD Radeon 7600M XT\n1440p: Nvidia RTX 5070/5070 Ti or AMD Radeon 7800M\n2160p: Nvidia RTX 5080 / 5090 or AMD Radeon 7900M\nSelecting the best gaming laptop is straightforward if you have a substantial budget, but finding a high-quality gaming laptop becomes more challenging with limited funds. Fortunately, the market now offers more budget-friendly CPUs and GPUs that don't skimp on power.\nFor all resolutions, 16GB RAM and at least 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD storage is recommended. Increasingly, 8GB RAM isn't going to be enough for gaming, and many modern PC titles can use up 100GB of storage, so 512GB might not be enough for your game library. You'll also need an Intel Core i5 or Core 5 Ultra processor, or an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, at minimum, but an Intel Core i7/Core 7 Ultra processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 equivalent is recommended.\nFor 1080p gaming, to get 60 fps on most games at their highest settings, you'll need at least an Nvidia RTX 5050 or AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT GPU, though an Nvidia RTX 5060 is preferred. If the video memory (VRAM) of the GPU is 8GB, then 1080p is the best resolution to play at (you certainly don't want less than 8GB).\nFor 1440p gaming, to get 60 fps on most games on max graphical settings, you'll need to make sure you have at least an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU, though an RTX 5070 Ti is better, and for AMD, a Radeon RX 7800M will be enough for 1440p gaming. You'll want to make sure that the VRAM for the GPU is 12GB at a minimum.\nFor 2160p (4K) gaming, you'll need a bare minimum of an Nvidia RTX 5080 or AMD RX 7900M GPU, but to ensure that you're getting consistent 60 fps on most modern PC titles, you may want to invest in a gaming laptop with an RTX 5090 graphics card. You'll certainly want a GPU with no less than 16GB of VRAM. Remember, even if a gaming laptop doesn't come with a 4K screen (few do), you can still connect it to a 4K monitor or 4K TV.\nHow we tested these gaming laptops\nEvaluating a gaming laptop is more complex than it might seem, much like the process of choosing the right one. We approach this task with the utmost seriousness, even if it involves extensive gaming \u2013 a necessary sacrifice, of course.\nIn our rigorous testing process, every gaming laptop undergoes thorough evaluation to ensure it lives up to its promises and justifies your investment. This involves not only playing the latest and most popular games to assess gaming and thermal performance but also conducting synthetic benchmarks like PCMark 10, 3DMark, and Geekbench 6, along with battery life tests.\nCurrently, as of July 2025, these are the games we use to benchmark the gaming laptops we review. Recently, we've included both native game performance as well as looking at how upscaling technology, particularly DLSS, impacts performance. While native gameplay remains the best way to judge the raw power of a gaming laptop, most PC gamers play with upscaling enabled, so we want our benchmarks to reflect the experience many gamers will have.\nGame | Settings |\nCivilization VII | Balanced Upscaling, Max Resolution, High | Max Resolution, High | 1080p, Medium |\nShadow of the Tomb Raider | Balanced Upscaling - Max Resolution, Highest | Max Resolution, Highest | 1080p, Medium |\nTotal War: Warhammer III: Mirrors of Madness | Max Resolution, Ultra | Max Resolution, Ultra | 1080p, Medium |\nCyberpunk 2077 | Balanced Upscaling - Max Resolution, Ultra | Max Resolution, Ultra | 1080p, Medium |\nBlack Myth: Wukong | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Cinematic | 1080p, Cinematic |\nMonster Hunter Wilds | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nDune: Awakening | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nCounterstrike 2 | Max Resolution, Very High | 1080p, Low |\nRed Dead Redemption 2 | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nMetro: Exodus | Max Resolution, Extreme | 1080p, Extreme |\nAssassins Creed: Shadows | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nHorizon: Zero Dawn Remaster | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nF1 2024 | Balanced Upscaling [50%] - Max Resolution, Max Quality | 1080p, Max Quality |\nWe are continually revising the list of benchmarked games to ensure we're testing gaming laptops with a mix of the very latest games alongside ever-popular games, with a mix of genres. While most of the games we benchmark are used to test the capabilities of a laptop's GPU, we also include titles such as Total War: Warhammer III, which are more CPU-intensive to make sure the processor of the gaming laptop we're reviewing can keep up without causing performance bottlenecks.\nWhen benchmarking these games, we're evaluating the average frame rate the gaming laptop achieves. This is measured in frames per second (fps), and the more frames per second the game hits, the better the performance.\nAnother very important factor to consider when buying any laptop is the battery life. Due to the power-hungry components inside the best gaming laptops, their batteries don't last nearly as long as standard laptops. It's also worth noting that many gaming laptops will reduce the performance of the GPU and CPU (a process sometimes known as 'throttling') when on battery power, so for the best gaming performance, you'll usually want it plugged in anyway.\nOf course, when you're not gaming, you'll still want to use your laptop when away from a plug socket, so we extensively test out each gaming laptop's battery with a series of benchmarks designed to run the battery down and record the times.\nThese benchmarks replicate real-world use such as web browsing (our Web Surfing Battery Informant benchmark), general use, and gaming (PCMark 10), and video playback (where we run a looped 1080p video with screen brightness set to 50% until the battery dies). We combine this with real-world experience during the review,s where we use the laptop on battery power throughout a work day and see how fast the laptop takes to fully charge its battery to get the best possible idea of how long a laptop's battery lasts.\nWe also scrutinize the laptop's peripherals. This includes checking the display's quality and response time, the comfort and responsiveness of the keyboard, the availability and variety of ports, the overall design, and the webcam's performance for potential game streaming use.\nFinally, we weigh all these factors against the laptop's price. We assess if its performance and features justify the cost and whether it offers the best value to customers.\nToday's best gaming laptop deals\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\n- Matt HansonManaging Editor, Core Tech"

Today's slates run the gamut from professional-grade computers like the Apple iPad Air with the Apple M3 inside, one of the best Apple iPads, to dependable Android productivity machines like Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, one of the best Android tablets. Our team rigorously tests tablets every day, so we know what separates the must-haves from the money-wasters.\nHow do we pick our winners? We hammer out stories on these tablets with a keyboard attached, fight it out in the latest games with an Xbox controller, and binge-watch entire seasons of our favorite shows. We read, browse, and doomscroll through social media until the battery cries for bedtime. Then, it's off to Future Labs, where we subject each tablet to a gauntlet of benchmark software and our own proprietary tests to measure the performance down to the last pixel.\nWe've finally tested the first tablet with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the OnePlus Pad 3, and it's leapt to the top of our Android tablet ladder as one of the best tablets for the needs of most people. Unless you need to run professional-strength software or use this tablet instead of a laptop, the OnePlus Pad 3 will be one of the most satisfying tablets you can choose.\nWill there be more tablets coming in 2025? We'll be on the lookout, and we're still testing more bargain tablets and options from brands that don't usually make this list, so check back soon to see if a new contender will emerge as the best tablet you can buy.\nQuick List\nBest iPad for most people\nApple's latest iPad 11th generation tablet didn't change much over its predecessor, but it didn't need to. The iPad is the most reliable and simplest tablet you'll find, with great battery life and enough power to run your favorite apps for years to come.\nRead more below\nBest premium iPad\nThe newest iPad Pro is the thinnest product Apple has ever produced. With an M4 chipset on board, the iPad Pro is more powerful than most computers. It also uses a super-bright OLED display. It's not cheap, but the 13-inch iPad Pro is the best tablet money can buy.\nRead more below\nBest Android for most people\nThe third time is charming with the OnePlus Pad 3, a high-powered Android tablet that finally pushes Android to the forefront of premium tablets. The Pad 3 has the best display, the fastest processor, and the biggest battery of any Android tablet, making it an easy pick for serious tablet users who want a powerful, portable Pad.\nRead more below\nBest premium Android\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is water resistant, and its big screen is great for drawing with the included S Pen. It's performance is built for gaming, but it handles multi-tasking better than most tablets. This is a perfect tablet for tablet bundle deals from your mobile carrier.\nRead more below\nBest budget tablet\nYou can find a tablet cheaper than this, but Apple's iPad 10.2 from 2021 is a great deal right now and offers much better value than the really cheap Android tablets. Plus, it will get new iPadOS updates for a few more years. We're always keeping a keen eye out for tablet deals on this one.\nRead more below\nBest battery life\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus is a surprisingly good tablet that competes nicely against Apple's big iPad Air M3. It's not as powerful, but it gives you so many more features, including a water resistant design, the best multitasking on any tablet, and an S Pen in the box. If you haven't considered this beautiful, durable powerhouse tablet, you really should.\nRead more below\nLoad the next three products...\nBest for gaming\nWith a powerful new Apple M3 chipset inside, the iPad Air is the perfect tablet for gaming. It has a fantastic display, great battery life, and it's light enough to be portable and easy to hold while playing.\nBest for drawing\nThe Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra is one of the largest tablets you can buy, and that makes it perfect for drawing and creation. It isn't the fastest tablet around, and battery life might keep you close to the wall outlet, but it's the best big drawing tablet if you want versatile, powerful tools for creativity.\nBest compact\nThe iPad mini wins the award for best compact tablet by a knockout: all the best competitors stopped making small tablets. It's more powerful than the base model iPad, and even though the latest update was underwhelming, this is still a great tablet, especially if you like them small.\nThe best tablet 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWe've tested every tablet included here extensively, so you know you can trust our recommendations and know that each entry has earned a place on this list.\nThe best iPad for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want a solid tablet and you have an iPhone or MacOS computer, the iPad should be your first stop. Apple's enrty-level tablet is refined, powerful, and reliable, with just enough features to keep you entertained or help you be productive. There's a reason Apple has dominated tablets since the iPad created this market.\nThe latest iPad 11 doesn't offer much more than before, but it doesn't have to. This tablet uses the Apple A16 processor found in older iPhone models, not the latest Apple M4 or M3 chipset, like the iPads Pro and Air. That won't bother most users, as this tablet is plenty powerful for gaming, working, and creating.\nThe latest iPad 11th generation tablet from Apple seems to deliberately keep the entry level from using Apple Intelligence, for better and for worse. That's fine by me, I haven't been so impressed with Apple's AI that I would spend more money to have it on my iPad. This iPad 11 still has the rest of Apple's great iPadOS features, and it will be upgradeable to the luscious new iPadOS 26 later this year.\nUnless you're running serious creativity software or you need to use this tablet as a laptop replacement, there's little need for most folks to upgrade to a more expensive iPad than this. The iPad 11-inch 11th generation tablet with the Apple A16 inside is the perfect starter tablet for Apple fans and anybody who just wants a bigger screen to go with their smartphone.\nRead the full iPad 11-inch (2025) review\nThe best premium iPad\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe iPad Pro 13 (2024) is unquestionably the biggest and baddest tablet money can buy in 2024. At 13 inches, it's the largest iPad ever, but it's also the most advanced, offering tandem OLED technology on an Apple XDR-branded display.\nThe newest iPad Pro comes equipped with an Apple M4 chip, too, meaning it's just as powerful as the very best MacBooks. This particular model boasts 20% better thermal performance than the previous iPad Pro, while also offering four times the rendering performance. So, if you thought the iPad Pro 12.9 (2022) was powerful, you'll be blown away by the iPad Pro 13 (2024).\nFor creative types, Apple's new iPad Pro supports the impressive Apple Pencil Pro stylus, not to mention the redesigned Magic Keyboard. When it comes to cameras, you'll get 12MP rear snapper, though you'll need to turn to your phone (or proper camera) for any ultra-wide and telephoto shots.\nNaturally, you'll have to pay handsomely for the privilege of owning this particular tablet, and if you just want to video chat with friends and watch movies, then it's serious overkill. However, if you're in the market for the best of the best, look no further than the iPad Pro 13 (2024).\nRead our full iPad Pro 13 (2024) review\nThe best Android tablet for most people\nSpecifications\nThe OnePlus Pad 3 finally endows an Android tablet with the fastest Qualcomm processor around, the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. With Qualcomm's push, the Pad 3 is the fastest Android tablet you can buy, with amazing battery life to boot. In fact, like recent OnePlus phones, it's hard to find anything I don't like about this tablet.\nThe OnePlus Pad 3 has the best display on any tablet in this price range. It's more sharp than the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus, and it draws faster than the Samsung tablet or the iPad Air 13-inch, with a 144Hz refresh rate. In our tests, this display was exceptionally bright and clear, but the Pad 3 still had amazing long battery life.\nYou don't need a OnePlus phone to appreciate the OnePlus Pad 3, though it might help. OnePlus doesn't add as many cross-device features as Samsung or Apple, but if you buy an accompanying keyboard, you can quickly tap your phone to pair the two devices and share content across each.\nThe OnePlus Pad 3 is a premium tablet with a high price tag, so it isn't for everybody. If you don't need this much power or such a huge display, there are better options available. If you want the absolute best, most stunning Android tablet I've seen, with power that pushes performance over the top, the OnePlus Pad 3 should be the top tablet on your list.\nRead our in-depth OnePlus Pad 3 review\nThe best premium Android tablet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is a top-tier tablet that's bursting at the seams with features you won't find on Apple's rival iPad tablets or other Android tablets. It's a serious contender for the tablet throne, and it's the best premium Android tablet you can buy.\nPowered by a MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ processor, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is a gaming powerhouse, with even better gaming benchmark performance one some tests than an iPad Pro M4 tablet. This chip excels at graphics performance, making it ideal for demanding games.\nBut it's not just about raw power. Samsung's software, with the included S Pen, elevates this tablet to a productivity machine. Multitasking is a breeze, and the S Pen adds a layer of precision and control that's perfect for creative work and note-taking.\nAt 12.4 inches, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus isn't very portable, and Apple's newer 13-inch iPad Pro (2024) takes the lead in slimness. However, Samsung scores a major point by including the S Pen in the box, unlike Apple, who makes you shell out extra for the Apple Pencil. While benchmark tests might give the iPad Pro an edge in processing power, the Tab S10 Plus holds its own in real-world performance. Plus, Samsung's IP68 water resistance makes it a more durable and versatile companion for everyday life.\nPrice-wise, the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus goes head-to-head with the 11-inch iPad Pro. But with Samsung, you get more screen real estate, a larger battery to keep you going, and the S Pen included.\nSamsung also makes the best tablet software. It's incredibly intuitive for multitasking, and you can even transform the Tab S10 Plus into a desktop-like experience by connecting it to a monitor and keyboard.\nUltimately, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is the Android tablet to beat. It's a powerful, versatile, and feature-rich device that challenges Apple's dominance in the tablet space.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus review\nThe best budget tablet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe iPad 10.2 (2021) is not the cheapest tablet you can buy, but it might be the cheapest tablet you SHOULD buy, since it's such a powerful tablet and a great entryway into Apple's walled garden. You can find cheaper tablets from Samsung, Amazon, and other brands, but Apple's iPad 10.2 gives you the experience of a premium tablet, for the cheapest possible price.\nEven though it's a bit older, Apple supports its iPad tablets with regular software updates, so you can be sure that this tablet will get iPadOS on the same day as the best iPads you can buy. You can't say that about older Samsung Galaxy Tab tablets or any of the bargain tablets you might find. Apple's service and support are second-to-none, even when you're buying the least expensive iPad it makes.\nBetter yet, Apple's iPad 10.2 doesn't saddle you with ads or unnecessary software, like Amazon Fire tablets, and it feels much faster than similarly-priced Samsung tablets. You'll have no trouble running the latest apps, playing games on the larger screen, and browsing any website you please.\nIf this is still too much to spend, check out our list of the best budget tablets you can buy, but if you can afford to buy Apple's least expensive iPad, you'll be happier that you did.\nRead our full iPad 10.2 (2021) review\nThe best battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus suffers from terrible naming, but don't let that get in the way of admiring Samsung big iPad Air competitor. The FE means it's cheaper than a Tab S10 Plus, but it's still water resistant, packed with great software, and perfect for drawing, Journaling, and doodles.\nWhile Samsung tablets seem underpowered on paper compared to the competition, you won't notice any slowdown as you snap multiple windows to the screen or play games on the huge display. The Tab S10 FE Plus handled everything we threw it's way in our hands-on testing. No task was too big for this tablet.\nIf you travel with your tablet and want to read or work by the pool, you need to forget about the iPad and get this tablet instead. Samsung's water resistant design is no joke. You can use this tablet in the bathtub, and if it gets dirty you can wash it in the sink. Don't do that with any iPad you care about.\nThis tablet also comes in a smaller flavor without the Plus, and it's the same inside either way, so pick your favorite size. Unlike the iPad, I've seen great deals on this tablet as well during the big sales holidays, so you might hold out and find a spectacular discount as well.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus review\nThe best gaming tablet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe 2025 iPad Air, available in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, becomes a seriously compelling mobile gaming platform thanks to the inclusion of Apple's powerful M3 chip. While the design remains unchanged, retaining the sleek aluminum build and vibrant Liquid Retina display (though without ProMotion 120Hz refresh), the M3 transforms the Air into a powerful gaming machine. This upgrade, without a price hike from the previous M2 model, makes the new Air a fantastic value for gamers.\nThe M3 chip's performance is where this iPad Air truly shines for gaming. It handles demanding AAA titles with ease, thanks to hardware-accelerated ray tracing. Games like Death Stranding and Resident Evil run smoothly, showcasing impressive visuals.\nBeyond raw power, the iPad Air boasts other features beneficial to gamers. The stereo speakers get surprisingly loud, providing immersive audio without headphones. Battery life is also a strong point, providing all-day usage for most tasks, including extended gaming sessions. The iPadOS experience is fluid, and multitasking features like Stage Manager even allow you to keep a game running in a window while you browse the web or chat with friends.\nThe iPad Air (M3) is an excellent choice for tablet gaming. With a vibrant display, great speakers, and solid battery life, the iPad Air offers a premium mobile gaming experience without the premium price tag of the iPad Pro. It's a great choice for gamers who want a versatile device that excels at both entertainment and productivity.\nRead our full Apple iPad Air 11-inch (2025) review\nThe best drawing tablet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is one of the biggest mainstream tablets you can buy, and it's great for drawing or basic productivity tasks. Samsung's software excels on a tablet display, and the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra brings features that no iPad can match, like its water resistant design and its microSD expansion slot.\nThat said, you might be happier finding a deal on the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra if you can, because the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra isn't much of an upgrade... like, at all. In some ways, it's actually a step backwards, like that MediaTek 9300 processor that has no business on Samsung's big creativity and business tablet.\nIf you want the biggest and best Android display, look no further, and the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra handles everything you'll find in the Google Play Store with ease, including fast multiplayer games, Adobe photo and video tools, and more.\nIf you mostly want a tablet you can get wet, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and FE Plus are cheaper options that handle almost everything the Ultra can do, only smaller. Hopefully this year will bring a powerhouse Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra to topple this list.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra review\nThe best compact tablet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere's still nothing like the Apple iPad mini. If you want a compact tablet that you can fit in a jacket pocket, the iPad mini isn't just the best small tablet you can buy, it's one of the only small tablets worth buying. You can find media playing tablets from Amazon and cheaper Android brands with small screens, but if you need a good compact tablet, the Apple iPad mini is a great choice, and it's the only one worth considering.\nSadly, that's because the best tablet makers have opted for larger sizes, and we no longer have a small Galaxy Tab from Samsung or a small Pixel or Nexus tablet from Google. That doesn't mean the iPad mini is only worth choosing because it's the default. The iPad mini is surprisingly powerful, though Apple has left it behind the larger iPad pack by including an A17 Pro chipset instead of an Apple M2 or better platform.\nThe iPad mini is ready for all of the latest software and games, including Apple Intelligence, since it uses the same processor as the iPhone 15 Pro.\nWith such performance, the iPad mini (2024) isn't cheap, and it hasn't gotten any major new features with the latest update, but it's still a capable compact and the best small tablet you'll find.\nRead our full Apple iPad mini 8.3-inch (2024) review\nHow we test tablets\nOur reviewers test the best tablets at home and in the office, and work with Future Labs to make sure each tablet is tested by our performance laboratory. We use tablets in our daily lives every day, and will replace our work laptop computers with a tablet for regular use and testing. We travel with tablets and use them extensively for work and personal travel. We use tablets for fun, for games, for creating art, for getting work done, and for doing nothing at all.\nFAQs\nWhat is the best brand of tablets?\nIs the Apple iPad or the Samsung Galaxy Tab the best tablet brand, or is there another tablet brand to consider?\nTablet makers often match features to your smartphone, so the best brand of tablets for you may be the same brand as your phone. The Apple iPad and the Samsung Galaxy Tab are two of our favorite tablet brands, and OnePlus boasts an excellent tablet, too: the OnePlus Pad.\nWhat should I look for when buying a tablet?\nThe first thing to look for is the operating system, if you want to use your tablet alongside your Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy phone. If that doesn't matter, you should consider the size of the display and how you'll be carrying and using the tablet. If you plan on doing more professional work on your tablet as a laptop replacement, you should consider the tablet's performance handling multiple apps or pro-level apps. Of course, price is always a consideration, because the least expensive tablets are surprisingly capable, and you may not need to spend more.\nWhat tablet can replace a laptop?\nThe Apple iPad Air and iPad Pro models are also powerful enough to do work, but Apple does not make it easy to keep multiple windows and multiple apps open at the same time. Apple makes better keyboard accessories for its tablets, especially the Magic Keyboard, but that accessory is expensive, and most tablets will work with any Bluetooth or USB-C keyboard you find. Samsung makes better office productivity software for tablets, but its latest tablets lack a great keyboard option that equal the Apple Magic Keyboard.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra might be just the right tablet for you, but if you don\u2019t need a big, water-resistant Android, you should probably just buy an iPad Pro. Other than the design, the Tab Ultra lags in performance, battery life, and advanced, Pro-level software to justify the high price tag. If it were hundreds less, I\u2019d rave about this tablet, but instead it overpromises and underdelivers.\nPros\n- +\nBrilliant big display is great for everything\n- +\nWater resistant design is unique and durable\nCons\n- -\nMediaTek processor performance doesn\u2019t match Samsung\u2019s top phones\n- -\nBattery life can\u2019t compete with iPad Pro, doesn\u2019t come close\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra review: One-minute review\nMaybe a giant tablet like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra seems wild to some, but to me it makes a lot of sense. I love a huge screen; the bigger the better. I want a tablet that can be a work surface, a drawing space, a tabloid newspaper, and a television stand-in when I\u2019m moving to a new house and my TV is packed. Like all of Samsung\u2019s \u2018Ultra\u2019 devices, the Tab S10 Ultra is all I need and much more.\nHow much more? There\u2019s the S Pen, of course, which clings loosely to the back of the Tab S10 Ultra, so you\u2019ll definitely want to buy Samsung\u2019s Smart Book Cover case, at least.\nAlso, the Tab S10 Ultra is water resistant enough to take a dunk, which may seem superfluous for a tablet that would never possibly fit in a toilet, but it speaks to the Tab's durability. You can use it in the bath tub, or the pool, or in a wet environment, then wash it in the sink. That\u2019s pretty amazing for a tablet this size.\nThere\u2019s also\u2026 um, actually that\u2019s kind of all there is? Okay, there\u2019s Galaxy AI, of course, but nobody should buy a premium Android tablet for features like Sketch to Image or Circle to Search. Maybe someday AI will be a \u2018system seller,\u2019 as the gamers say, but for now it\u2019s barely a bonus feature.\nOtherwise, this is almost exactly the same as last year's Tab S9 Ultra, which is both good news and bad. The good news is that last year\u2019s tablet was great! I reviewed the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and I thought it was a powerhouse for productivity, and you actually get a lot of technology, even though the price is high.\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is so close to last year\u2019s model that all of the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra accessories work with this tablet. But a warning: if you want a keyboard, don\u2019t buy Samsung\u2019s offering. I wouldn\u2019t usually knock accessories so hard, but this is an important component of a laptop replacement tablet. Samsung needs a much better keyboard for the Tab S series. Samsung\u2019s keyboard is flimsy and unpleasant.\nThe Tab S10 Ultra version has an AI key... awesome. For the same price (even less!), Apple owners get a Magic Keyboard that's rigid and premium. You can lift the iPad by the lip of the keyboard, but don\u2019t try that with Samsung\u2019s QWERTY.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe good news is that all the third-party cases and covers for the Tab S9 Ultra fit the S10 Ultra. Cool, there are some good options on Amazon, at least. But that means this tablet is basically unchanged from last year, on the outside at least.\nUsually, when a product doesn\u2019t change much year-over-year, there's either a big upgrade under the hood, or there is a price drop for new buyers. Unfortunately, neither of those things happened.\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the same price as the Tab S9 Ultra in the US and UK, and it\u2019s $50 more in Australia. Inside, you get a\u2026 hold on, [checks notes] MediaTek Dimensity 9300. Wait, seriously?! Samsung is using a MediaTek processor? Instead of Qualcomm? Instead of Samsung Semiconductor!?\nOooooookay. Well, the results are what you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s a good brain for a tablet, but it isn\u2019t a Snapdragon. Last year\u2019s Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra came with the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chipset found in the Galaxy S23 family. This year\u2019s Galaxy S24 uses a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. The MediaTek 9300 can mostly keep up with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and once in a while beat it, but not always.\nWhy is there a MediaTek chip in this flagship Samsung tablet? MediaTek makes a respectable, less expensive chip that focuses more on graphics performance than overall raw power. The Tab S10 Ultra does have slightly better graphics capabilities than a Galaxy S24 phone, but this is supposed to be Samsung\u2019s best tablet. Why is it only slightly better?\nApple is loading its comparably priced iPad Pro with an Apple M4 chip, which is more powerful than most Windows laptops. Samsung gives you a lot more display on the Tab S10 Ultra, but at the cost of so much performance that it knocks the Ultra back into a lower category. This is a gigantic mid-range tablet, not a premium flagship.\nIf you want to run pro-level software, you should buy Apple\u2019s tablet. If you want the biggest, best display to run all of your Android apps and games and watch your favorite content, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is a great choice, with a screen that will knock your socks off. But we all know it should be a few hundred bucks cheaper.\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra review: price and availability\n- Starts at $1,1199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,049 for 12GB RAM and 256GB storage\n- A 5G version is available, but not in the US\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is Samsung\u2019s biggest and most expensive tablet, and it costs a bit less than the iPad Pro 13-inch, which is a point in its favor, considering Samsung gives you a humongous 14.6-inch display. That\u2019s not a small difference: the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra display offers 65% more screen area than the iPad Pro 11-inch.\nBesides the big screen, does the Tab S10 Ultra justify its price tag? Let\u2019s consider features that you won\u2019t find anywhere else. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is water resistant, like all of Samsung\u2019s recent Galaxy Tab S tablets (including the Galaxy Tab S9 FE, if you need a cheaper, water-resistant tablet). If you\u2019re going to use your tablet in the rain, or in the pool, or if you just want to doomscroll in the bathtub, the Galaxy Tab S is your only choice.\nOtherwise, Samsung\u2019s key advantage is, surprisingly, software. Samsung does a much better job with tablet software than Apple. It\u2019s easier to multi-task, open multiple windows, and use your tablet with an external monitor and keyboard. Samsung even does a great job integrating its tablet with your Samsung phone and Galaxy Book laptop, if you have recent Samsung devices.\nAll of Samsung\u2019s tablets are good at multitasking, you don\u2019t need to spend $1,1199.99 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,049 to get this software experience. Even the Tab Ultra\u2019s display isn\u2019t the advantage it was in the past. Apple\u2019s latest iPad Pro tablets pack the most advanced OLED I\u2019ve ever seen on a tablet. It\u2019s thinner, brighter, and sharper looking than Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, even if it\u2019s smaller.\nSamsung gives you an S Pen with the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, while Apple makes you pay $129 / \u00a3129 / AU$219 for an Apple Pencil. That\u2019s a nice bonus, but it doesn\u2019t justify Samsung\u2019s high price.\nApple gives you a desktop-class chip, while Samsung includes a MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ chipset that is\u2026 not bad? It\u2019s good at gaming, but not as powerful as Apple\u2019s M4 in the iPad Pro, and it doesn\u2019t even top the Apple M2 in the iPad Air, except in a few graphics benchmarks.\nApple gives you a better, more advanced display, a thinner tablet, and incredible power. Unless you need a water-resistant tablet, or if your games are only available on Android, it\u2019s hard to justify the price tag for the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. The Tab S9 FE is a much better buy for those benefits.\nRAM/Storage | 12GB/256GB | 12GB/512GB | 16GB/1TB |\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra | $1,199.99 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,099 | $1,319.99 / \u00a31,299 / AU$2,299 | $1,619.99 / \u00a31,549 / AU$2,799 |\n- Value: 3/5\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra review: specs\nStarting price | $1,1199.99 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,349 |\nOperating system | One UI 6.1 on Android 14 |\nChipset | Mediatek Dimensity 9300+ |\nMemory (RAM) | 12GB / 16GB |\nStorage | 256GB / 512GB / 1TB |\nDisplay | 14.6-inch AMOLED 120Hz |\nWeight | 718g |\nBattery | 11,200mAh |\nCharging | 45W wired |\nIP Rating | IP68: 1 meter under water for 30 minutes |\nIt was a shocking move for Samsung to include a MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ chipset in its Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. The last Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra used the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, which was the same processor used in the Galaxy S23 Ultra phone, launched the same year. This year\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra phone uses a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, and that\u2019s what I expected on the premiere tablet.\nWhy use MediaTek instead of Qualcomm or a Samsung Exynos chip? My guess is that Samsung wants to diversify its chip supply, and the Tab S10 Ultra is a safe place to stick the first processor from a new partnership. [Full disclosure: I worked on Samsung\u2019s PR team from 2011 to 2017 and was never involved in chip decisions, I only know what other technology journalists know.]\nSamsung will tell you that the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 is exceptional at gaming, and it wanted this tablet to appeal to gamers. While MediaTek does win some benchmark races on the graphics side of Future Labs testing, it falls short on processing performance compared to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon, and it\u2019s generations behind Apple\u2019s M4 chipset when it comes to processing power.\nI\u2019ll talk about whether the MediaTek 9300 delivered on that gaming promise below in the Performance section (spoiler: it did, but it\u2019s still a mobile chipset).\nOtherwise, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has an impressive list of specs. It comes with plenty of RAM to start, 12GB, and you can boost that to 16GB if you buy an upgraded storage model.\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra also uses Wi-Fi 7, which the iPad Pro still lacks. If you have the latest networking equipment installed and you want to take advantage, the Galaxy Tab is ready.\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra review: display\n- Massive 14.6-inch screen is a new level of tablet bigness\n- Samsung thankfully sticks with Wacom tech for the S Pen\nYou can\u2019t find a bigger, better display on a tablet than the huge 14.6-inch OLED screen on the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. If you are considering a tablet as a laptop replacement, the Tab S10 Ultra gives you more screen space than a 14-inch Macbook Pro, though finding the right keyboard could be tricky.\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab gives you much more screen real-estate than a similarly-priced iPad, but is it still a better display? The latest iPad Pro uses an OLED screen that is more sharp, with 264 pixel-per-inch density, compared to 239 ppi on Samsung\u2019s display. Is that enough to notice? Not really, but bragging rights are important at this price.\nApple\u2019s latest iPad Pro is also much brighter than the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, which makes a difference if you work outside, though the iPad Pro can\u2019t handle a rain storm like the Galaxy Tab.\nSamsung still refuses to support Dolby Vision on its displays, and you can spot the difference side-by-side if you compare, say, Netflix movies on an iPad Pro and the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. There is HDR10+ support, but not the Dolby HDR video standard.\nI\u2019m happy to see Samsung keeps using Wacom\u2019s electromagnetic resonance (EMR) technology for its S Pen. I\u2019ve seen a few mobile manufacturers switch to their own technology recently. That usually means a battery and an added expense. Samsung\u2019s S Pen has a battery, but it\u2019s for additional features like Bluetooth and the motion sensor; the pen still works without a charge if you just want to draw.\n- Display: 5/5\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra review: design\n- Water resistant design is unique among premium tablets\n- Same size and shape as Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra\nWith a tablet this big, the design should get out of the way of the screen and the viewing experience, so I\u2019m not expecting much. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has some design highlights but nothing special. I like the cool, tech-y antenna lines on the back that give it a futuristic sheen, but otherwise it\u2019s just a big slab.\nThere are four speakers hidden around the edges of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, so things get loud when you hold the tablet in landscape mode for movie watching. The camera is also centered for landscape viewing, as it should be.\nThe only buttons on the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra are the power and volume buttons, and Samsung has managed to screw up the volume keys. You\u2019ll need to remember which side is up, because the Galaxy Tab won\u2019t help.\nHere\u2019s what I mean: an Apple iPad is smart enough to know that however you are holding the tablet, pressing the volume rocker button on top should turn up the volume. If you hold the iPad upside down, it flips the orientation of the volume keys.\nThe Galaxy Tab has fixed Up and Down volume keys, and if you hold the tablet upside down, you need to press down to turn the volume Up. If this seems hard to explain, it\u2019s even worse to use in real life.\nIf you plan on using the S Pen and not losing the S Pen, I highly recommend buying Samsung\u2019s back cover. It has a nice garage that holds the S Pen in the right spot to charge wirelessly against the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. I wish there was a proper silo like there is on the Galaxy S24 Ultra phone, but that would mean a much smaller S Pen, so I\u2019ll accept the trade off.\nI don\u2019t recommend Samsung\u2019s keyboard case, and I\u2019m not sure there is a great option to turn the Galaxy S10 Ultra into a proper laptop replacement, which is a huge miss on Samsung\u2019s part. Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard, which costs less than Samsung\u2019s Keyboard Cover with a trackpad, is a much more premium accessory. You can lift the iPad Pro by grasping the front of the Magic Keyboard, while Samsung\u2019s expensive keyboard cover feels cheap and flimsy, with keys that are too shallow.\n- Design: 4/5\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra review: software\n- Still the best tablet software for multitasking\n- No significant enhancements for gaming\nSamsung\u2019s One UI software, running on top of Android 14, is packed with features, and maybe overstuffed for a smaller smartphone screen, but on a big tablet Samsung lets you cut loose. You can run up to four windows on screen at once, and it\u2019s easy to tile and arrange windows by dragging them where you want them. You can open apps or conversations in pop-up bubbles, and we haven\u2019t even got to the pop-up note taking and screen writing with the S Pen.\nWhile Apple pays lip service to multitasking on the iPad Pro, Samsung really makes it easy to do two or more things at once. I could research on the web while taking notes in Google Docs, or chat on a webcam meeting on one side, play a game on the other, and doomscroll in a floating window.\nWhile Samsung\u2019s operating system is great, I\u2019m worried that a big, expensive tablet like this is let down by the Android ecosystem. What are the premium apps that require so much screen size and power? Well, maybe not power, since the MediaTek processor isn\u2019t exactly a powerhouse. But it's pretty good at gaming, and Samsung has said this tablet is aimed at gaming enthusiasts.\nSo, where is the gaming software? When you buy an Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro, our best gaming phone, you don\u2019t just get top performance. You get a suite of software tools to help you control your game, tweak your system settings, and stream your sessions over your favorite social network. That\u2019s what it takes to call your device a gaming device. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra was great for playing games, but it\u2019s not an excellent gaming device.\n- Software: 4/5\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra review: performance\n- Good enough for Android, but not competitive with the iPad Pro\n- There better be a Snapdragon 8 Elite in the next Tab Ultra\nIt\u2019s a very weird time for Samsung to release a Galaxy Tab Ultra with a relatively underpowered MediaTek chipset. Apple offers the iPad Pro tablet with an Apple M4 chip that's more powerful than most Windows laptop computers. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra doesn\u2019t come close to that level of performance.\nThen we have Qualcomm, which followed up one of its best chips in memory, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, with a chipset that could truly be a revolutionary step forward, the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite. The latter wasn\u2019t available in time for the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra launch, but the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 has been the most powerful chip in smartphones over the past year. Samsung should know, that\u2019s the chip inside the Galaxy S24.\nFor the same price, you can have an Apple M4-powered iPad Pro. Heck, you could buy a Samsung Galaxy Book 4 360 laptop with a Snapdragon X processor inside and you\u2019d get more in just about every way for the same price. Why pay for a big, mid-range Android tablet when you can have a premium convertible laptop or professional-strength iPad?\nIf the answer is Android games, then the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra will satisfy hardcore gamers with its performance, but I wonder if a gigantic tablet is what the mobile gaming world wants.\nMany games won\u2019t work with a joystick. Genshin Impact, for instance, works with a joystick on the iPad, but not on Android tablets. That means I need to hold the huge tablet and manipulate the controls that were meant for a mobile phone.\nThere are quite a few games like this, and while I enjoyed playing games with my Xbox controller connected, I had a hard time manipulating onscreen controls while holding the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the huge size of this tablet, but for some tasks it simply might be too big.\n- Performance: 3/5\nGalaxy Tab S10 Ultra review: battery\n- Less battery life than last generation\n- Much less battery time than an iPad Pro\nBattery life on the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra was, frankly, unacceptable. While the tablet lasted through most of a work day, I usually kept it plugged in or charging when I was working at a desk because the big display can chug through battery time.\nOur Future Labs tests report the same. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra performed worse on our battery tests than the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. Both tablets came in behind Apple\u2019s iPad Pro, but the Tab S9 Ultra lasted around 9.5 hours and the Tab S10 lasted just over 9 hours. A small difference, but battery life should never, ever go down year over year.\nIn comparison, an iPad Pro 13-inch will give you almost 15 hours in the same test. That\u2019s a huge loss for Samsung, and battery life needs to be a priority on the next generation of Galaxy Tab S devices.\nI have to imagine that a Tab S10 Ultra with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 would have offered better battery life, based on tests I\u2019ve seen comparing the Gen 2 and Gen 3 platforms. Too bad Samsung didn\u2019t use that chipset here.\n- Battery: 2/5\nShould you buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s expensive, but you get a whole lot of screen for the money, in addition to a pen. Still, it\u2019s too expensive for what you get. | 3 / 5 |\nDisplay | The best part about the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra \u2013 it\u2019s big, beautiful, and ready for your artistic hand or your gaming fingers. | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | The same size and shape as last year, and it stays water resistant and durable, which is a unique selling point you won\u2019t find on any iPad. Still, I wish it was thinner. | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | Samsung makes the best tablet software you\u2019ll use, it\u2019s as good as using a desktop for productivity work. There aren\u2019t a lot of pro Android apps, though, and Galaxy AI is a questionable selling point. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Nope, the MediaTek chip is disappointing compared even to Samsung\u2019s base model Galaxy S24 phone. This is supposed to be the ultra-premium flagship tablet. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Battery life is shorter this year than last year, which is a big fail when you realize the iPad Pro lasts more than 50% longer, even with its desktop-class processor inside. Samsung must do better. | 2 / 5 |\nBuy it if\u2026\nYou play a lot of Android games\nIf you\u2019re playing a lot of games on your Android tablet, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra offers impressive gaming performance and the best big screen for gaming.\nYou want a big office tablet that\u2019s easy to use\nAn Android tablet is much simpler than a Windows tablet, and you have your work accounts loaded, just like with your phone. Go ahead, work on the Tab.\nYou want to draw and play and have fun\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is a big tablet for fun, indoors and outdoors, for doodling and gaming and playing with AI. Don\u2019t take it too seriously.\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026\nYou need a serious productivity tool\nIf you need real power and performance, and real desktop apps, you might need an iPad Pro or iPad Air.\nYou can get a deal on the Tab S9 Ultra\nThis is almost the same tablet as last year, so if you find the Tab S9 Ultra for much cheaper, just buy it instead.\nYou want a laptop replacement\nThe Tab S10 Ultra doesn\u2019t have any great keyboard options to help you replace a laptop, though you can use any desktop keyboard and mouse instead of Samsung\u2019s accessories.\nAlso consider\nNot convinced by the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra?

I carry two or more tablets when I travel for work and personal business, and I travel every month, often every few weeks.\nI used the Galaxy Tab 10 Ultra for two months as my primary work tablet, using it when I traveled for business and as a second screen at my office when I was working. I loaded it with my work accounts and apps, including Slack, Google Meet, Airtable, and Vampire Survivors.\nI tested the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra\u2019s durability by dunking it in my sink filled with water and rinsing it repeatedly. I used the Tab S10 Ultra with Samsung\u2019s keyboard with trackpad cover, as well as with my own SteelSeries USB-C keyboard, and a Bluetooth mouse. I also connected the Tab Ultra to my Dell monitor.\nI played many games on the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, mostly using an Xbox controller with Bluetooth. I played Genshin Impact, Call of Duty Mobile, Vampire Survivors, and games from my Xbox Series X console over Wi-Fi.\nThe Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra was also tested and benchmarked in Future Labs independently.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nOverall, using the Asus ROG Flow Z13 has been an exceptional experience; however, there are a few flaws here that prevent this gaming laptop/tablet hybrid from achieving a perfect score. While you get over 60fps in most games, even when playing with 'Ultra' graphics settings, at this price point you can pick up standard gaming laptops that provide better performance. However, there's no denying that this is a very sleek device for easy on-the-go gaming. It\u2019s lightweight, stays cool and quiet, and is extremely portable thanks to its compact design.\nPros\n- +\nGreat and consistent performance\n- +\nSleek and compact design\n- +\nStays cool and quiet even when playing AAA titles\nCons\n- -\n-Very expensive\n- -\n-Battery life is very short when gaming\n- -\n-Not available worldwide\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nAsus ROG Flow Z13: Two-minute review\nThis year has seen some of the best gaming laptops and gaming handhelds ever made hit the market, which means it can be hard to decide which device you want to pick up for your on-the-go gaming needs.\nHowever, what if you were to take both device categories and smoosh them together? You get the Asus ROG Flow Z13: a high-performance gaming tablet which, unlike other gaming tablets on the market, actually allows you to play ambitious AAA titles and achieve not just playable but good frame rates, all while staying cool and quiet.\nThe downsides, which stop this device from achieving a perfect score, is the battery life not being great when gaming. However, it does last a decent amount of time when using it for general browsing or watching videos.\nIt\u2019s also very expensive, coming in at over $2,000, which means this device is not for those who are on a budget, with gaming laptops in the same price range delivering much higher performance.\nAsus ROG Flow Z13 review: Price and availability\n- How much does it cost? $2,099 / \u00a32,199\n- When is it available? Available now\n- Where can you get it? Only available in certain regions\nComing in at $2,099 / \u00a32,199, this is an exceptionally expensive device in terms of gaming tablets. However, with alternatives unbale to offer a similar level of performance, it's hard to compare price-wise with other gaming tablets.\nHandheld alternatives are products like the Asus ROG Ally X, the gaming handheld from the same company, which comes in at $799 / \u00a3799, which is quite a bit cheaper, but uses the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme, which does not offer the same level of in-game performance.\nFor that, you'll be a bit stuck when it comes to handheld gaming PCs - you'll need to consider the best gaming laptops instead, which can offer better performance without the price premium the Asus ROG Flow Z13's unique 2-in-1 design seems to demand - and that means you're also not getting the same kind of portability.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Asus ROG Flow Z13 is available in certain regions including the UK and US, however unfortunately it cannot be picked up worldwide.\n- Value: 3 / 5\nAsus ROG Flow Z13 review: Specs\nThis gaming tablet from Asus ROG Flow Z13 comes in one iteration in 2025.

Compared to many gaming laptops that weigh around 3kg, the Asus ROG Flow Z13 comes in at just 1.2kg, perfect for taking your device on the go.\nIn terms of style, you get a simple and sleek tablet with a detachable keyboard and trackpad. There\u2019s a small window on the back of the device that allows you to view some of the components inside, which is a really nice touch.\nWhile it doesn\u2019t have an OLED screen - something that did shock me initially - the Asus ROG Flow Z13 still has a pretty nice display. It won\u2019t blow you away by any means, but it has a great color range and an exceptional refresh rate for a tablet at 180Hz.\nThere are a fair amount of ports on the Asus ROG Flow Z13 , including USB-A, two USB-C ports (either can be used for charging), HDMI, an audio jack, and a microSD card reader. This is great for those who are hoping to use other gaming peripherals with their device as there are plenty of options to plug in.\nThe included keyboard is extremely slim, and while I usually despise tablet keyboards, this one wasn\u2019t as squidgy as alternative options. It made for a satisfying typing and gaming experience, however for those playing competitive titles, I would recommend opting for an external gaming keyboard for those precise responses.\n- Design score: 5 / 5\nAsus ROG Flow Z13 review: Performance\n- Gaming performance is impressive\n- Overall user experience is great\n- Quiet when in use\nThese are the results of our benchmarking tests for the Asus ROG Flow Z13:\n3DMark: Night Raid: 36,307; Fire Strike: 11,230; Time Spy: 4,634\nGeekBench 6: 2,162 (single-core); 11,575 (multi-core)\nCrossMark: Overall: 1,417; Productivity: 1,241; Creativity: 1,760; Responsiveness: 1,100\nTotal War: Warhammer III (1080p, Ultra): 63; (1080p, Low): 122\nCyberpunk 2077 (1080p, Ultra): 73; (1080p, Low): 93\nDirt 5 (1080p, Ultra): 39; (1080p, Low): 80\nPCMark 10 Battery Life: 6 hr 4 min\nTechRadar movie test: 5hr 55 min\nIn terms of performance, the Asus ROG Flow Z13 delivers some pretty good framerates for a gaming tablet, however considering the price point, I was actually expecting more.\nWhile for the most part, you get above 60 fps when playing in 1080p at Ultra graphics presets, equivalently-priced gaming laptops would likely be delivering significantly better performance, as they can make use off more powerful hardware without having to fit it into a tablet-like form factor.\nThe Asus ROG Flow Z13 stayed very quiet the whole time I was using it. Even when putting it through its paces, like running AAA titles at Ultra, I was barely able to hear the device which makes it perfect for using on the go so you\u2019re not disturbing everyone around you.\nAs you\u2019d expect, due to how quiet it was, it also stayed very cool which is great for a tablet as it means you can still hold it and use the touchscreen as intended without worrying about burning your hands and fingers.\nThe speakers are pretty good, however as always I would recommend plugging in and using a headset to ensure the best gaming experience. For watching videos and movies, the speakers are absolutely perfect since you don\u2019t need the directional precision.\nOutside of the actual performance I was getting in-game, using the device itself has been a very pleasant experience. I enjoyed typing on it, and I found it easy to switch between tablet and laptop mode by just removing or flipping the keyboard back.\nOne downside for me was the built in trackpad, I found it a little bit slow in terms of responsiveness, while fine for browsing and general use, I obviously opted for a gaming mouse when playing.\n- Performance score: 3.5 / 5\nAsus ROG Flow Z13 review: Battery life\nThe battery life of the Asus ROG Flow Z13 is actually surprisingly great, surpassing even some of the highest-performance and more expensive gaming laptops I\u2019ve tried recently.\nWhen benchmarking the battery, I was able to get around sixhours of usage, which is more representative of watching videos on the device rather than gaming. When gaming on the Asus ROG Flow Z13, I found I got closer to four hours of battery, with AAA games draining the device even faster.\nFor example, when playing Cyberpunk I only got around an hour of half of game time before the device shut off, which certainly limits how portable this device actually is, no matter how thin and light it might be.\n- Battery life: 3 / 5\nShould I buy the Asus ROG Flow Z13?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | This is a very expensive device, but it\u2019s hard to compare to alternatives as it's so unique. | 3 / 5 |\nDesign | You get a sleek and stunning device which is lightweight and has an excellent range of ports. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | This tablet delivers great performance while staying cool and quiet however laptops at a similar price point would surpass this easily. | 4 / 5 |\nBattery life | While delivering a better battery life than some gaming laptops on the market, it's significantly reduced when gaming. | 3 / 5 |\nTotal Score | This unique gaming tablet can be used as a more traditional laptop, and offers impressive performance and a fantastic and innovative design.

I was sure to use the device all day for my typical workday, and then also used it for gaming in the evening.\nI took it on the go with me to different locations where I needed to work to see how it would feel outside of my workstation.

      "text": "I've been testing the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Asus ROG Ally for weeks \u2013 and so far, there's a clear winner\nI've been pursuing an 8-inch handheld gaming PC with enough processing power to storm through triple-A games easily, and simply put, the MSI Claw 8 AI+ is the answer. Not only does it have an immersive 1,920 x 1,200 display resolution, but the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor is what all handheld gamers would want.\nNew software and driver updates are proving significant in enhancing performance in games, with improved 1% lows (the lowest frame rates) and better frame pacing at lower wattages.\nOne of its trademarks is the ability to set the TDP (Thermal Design Power, or essentially, power consumption) to 17W, which extends battery life and, of course, decreases high temperatures, while still managing to provide high frame rates.\nIt's the first handheld I've used where I've been able to confidently run certain games on high graphics presets, without a heavy compromise on performance. You can do the same on other handheld gaming PCs, but not without heavy use of upscaling via either AMD's FSR 3 or Intel's XeSS, so there's a significant nosedive in image quality \u2013 which would be less of an issue if FSR 4 became available for handhelds, but I digress.\nThis isn't a full review just yet, so without giving too much away, I can at least say that the MSI Claw 8 AI+ is the best handheld gaming PC I've ever used so far. However, that's not the entire picture, as it's not exactly the winner in competition with other handhelds for now, and one in particular.\nThe Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme is the victor in the battle against the MSI Claw 8 AI+, for now...\nNow I know that might be a surprising read for you, but just hear me out. I've had my Asus ROG Ally for over a year now, playing plenty of triple-A and Indie games, so I have a good grasp of just how great this device is. AMD's Ryzen Z1 Extreme still holds up extremely well (no pun intended).\nThe new AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor is present in the MSI Claw A8, and recent benchmarks indicate a performance boost over its predecessor, the Z1 Extreme, but not by much (at least with what many were anticipating).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFurther benchmarks also indicate that the Ryzen Z2 Extreme has similar in-game performance results to the Claw 8 AI+'s Core Ultra 7 258V. Both the Claw 8 AI+ and the Claw A8 are around the same price; the Claw 8 AI+ retails at $900 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,799, with prices increasing due to tariffs, and the Claw A8 starts at \u20ac975 (around $1,140 / \u00a3840 / AU$1,750) in Germany.\nI've been very critical of handheld PC makers and the price point for upcoming handhelds, and I must note that while the MSI Claw 8 AI+ is easily the most powerful mainstream handheld gaming PC available now, the price is still not warranted in my book.\nThe Asus ROG Ally can often be found much cheaper than the $649 / \u00a3599 / AU$1,299 retail price, and you'll get fantastic performance across several games. Yes, as I've said, the MSI Claw 8 AI+ is the go-to for more power, performance, and battery life, but I often use my handhelds plugged in, and I don't think the jump in performance from a ROG Ally is significant enough to pay so much more.\nGames like Cyberpunk 2077 on the ROG Ally can hit 60fps and above with adjusted graphics settings at 1080p, and it's even better when using frame generation in-game or via Lossless Scaling.\nPerhaps the most important factor is that Bazzite, a SteamOS clone, is significantly better than Microsoft's Windows 11 for handheld gaming, and is nearly flawless on the ROG Ally in my experience. That's because performance in games is better on SteamOS compared to Windows 11, since there are no issues with bloatware or unnecessary processes running in the background.\nAs for the MSI Claw 8 AI+, compatibility is still in beta, and it's not using AMD hardware, so Bazzite, for now, isn't ideal to install on the device. It's an important point to make, because I genuinely believe that the Windows 11 experience on the MSI Claw 8 AI+ (alongside its MSI Center M software) is what hogs its potential.\nCertain games don't run well (like Devil May Cry 5), or won't run at all (notably Batman: Arkham Knight) on the Claw 8 AI+, which seemingly stems from Intel driver issues. These problems aren't prevalent in games, don't get me wrong, but enough for it to be a negative against the ROG Ally.\nIf the price of the MSI Claw 8 AI+ drops and Bazzite fully supports it, I'll change my tone\nI don't want to sound like a broken record, but the only handhelds that warrant prices close to or over $1,000 are ones like the Ayaneo Flip 1S DS at $1,299 / \u00a3961 / around AU$1,990 in early bird pricing (close to the MSI Claw 8 AI+'s price), which uses one of AMD's best APUs, the Ryzen AI 9 370, featuring two screens, with the main one as an OLED.\nThere's an even stronger case for the recently announced GPD Win 5, which is set to use the best AMD APU, the Ryzen AI+ Max 395, that rivals Nvidia laptop GPUs. I'm not saying I would buy those, because I don't need that level of power in a handheld device. What I'm saying is that high prices are justified with significantly more powerful hardware than what is currently available.\nSo, if the MSI's pricing falls to a more reasonable standard, which I honestly don't see happening, and Bazzite finally has full support for the Claw, then I'm all in.\nI would love to get a Lenovo Legion Go S Z1 Extreme, as that is up my alley thanks to its eight-inch display, but it's nowhere to be found in the UK. For now, it makes more sense for me to stick with the Asus ROG Ally.\nYou might also like...\n- Nvidia and MediaTek\u2019s rumored gaming laptop chip could match the RTX 4070\u2019s performance \u2013 and that\u2019d be a potential game-changer for handhelds\n- Intel\u2019s Nova Lake processors rumored to have unique hybrid architecture \u2013 are we moving away from discrete GPUs?\n- I didn\u2019t think 4K gaming handhelds were possible, but this DIY Nvidia RTX 4090 model has proved me wrong\nIsaiah is a Staff Writer for the Computing channel at TechRadar.

      "text": "Best gaming laptops of Gamescom 2025 - top picks from MSI, Samsung and more\nGaming on the go\nGamescom 2025 has been extremely eventful for the world of gaming hardware, with major manufacturers like Microsoft and MSI unveiling all-new gaming handhelds. However, falling by the wayside thanks to the bigger reveals is the flurry of incoming gaming laptops - and I\u2019ve rounded up all of the ones I saw, which we could see featured in our best gaming laptops guide when they release.\nI only got to spend a short time with each of these laptops as I traversed the cavernous halls of the event, but what I\u2019ve seen so far in terms of features, design, and specifications (featuring high end components from the likes of Intel, AMD, and Nvidia) have given me a good idea of what we can expect from these devices.\nWith big-league gaming brands like Samsung, MSI, and Lenovo all showcasing new devices, it makes perfect sense that these gaming laptops are the best I\u2019ve seen at Gamescom this year.\nMSI Titan 18 HX Dragon Edition Norse Myth\nNow\u2026 while the Titan 18 HX Dragon Edition Norse Myth may feel like a bit of a gimmicky collector's product rather than an actual mainstream gaming laptop, I\u2019m here to set the record straight and say that\u2019s far from the truth.\nFeaturing an Intel Core Ultra 9 200HX series processor paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, this thing is an absolute gaming beast, capable of tackling just about any title you boot up on it without any issue. In our MSI Titan 18 HX review earlier this year, we praised the laptop's powerful performance and top-notch physical design.\nThe design of the device is the main draw, and for good reason; it's absolutely stunning, with a hand-drawn etched pattern on the lid. You also get a 3D dragon and rune design on the palm rest, as well as an RGB trackpad, just in case you wanted that little bit of extra pizazz while using this thing.\nHP Omen Max 16\nThe HP Omen Max 16 takes the crown for the best screen I\u2019ve seen all week, with its 16-inch OLED display that absolutely blew me away. I played Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 on this device, and the depth of color and true blacks when walking into a dark room really took this experience up a notch.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhile OLED screens are becoming more popular and hopefully soon enough will be the industry standard, the real kicker with the HP Omen Max 16 was the spec sheet this display is paired with. You get an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX as well as an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, making for stunning graphics that take full advantage of that fantastic screen.\nLenovo Legion Pro 7\nIf the Lenovo Legion Pro 7 didn\u2019t have an RGB keyboard, I might not have even noticed it was a gaming laptop. Its sleek design conceals some pretty hardcore internal specs, including an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32 GB of RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card, all wrapped up inside a tidy chassis that could easily be mistaken for a productivity laptop.\nWhile this device isn\u2019t ultrathin - let's be honest, gaming laptops never are - it does measure roughly 2.5cm thick, which is much thinner than some other RTX 50-series gaming laptops, like the MSI Titan 18 HX, which comes in at 3.2cm thick. This makes it easier to take on the go for those who are regular commuters or just want a more portable gaming device.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra\nOkay, I know the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is not a gaming laptop, but somehow it was still one of the best gaming devices I saw at Gamescom, delivering impressively high-quality gaming performance. In this tablet, which is ridiculously thin and light at just 5.4mm thick, is a MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ CPU, which provides the graphical output for the device and does an amazing job.\nYou also get a 14.6-inch AMOLED display, as large as some gaming laptops, which looked absolutely beautiful as I played Genshin Impact. The range of colours in the game was made even more stunning thanks to the AMOLED panel, and when using this device, I genuinely forgot I was playing on a tablet. Pair this device with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and you\u2019ve got yourself the most portable gaming setup to exist.\nStay tuned for our full reviews of each of these devices when they release.\nYou might also like...\n- Gamescom Congress 2025 was bigger than ever before \u2013 here's why that matters to gamers\n- I think the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the only gaming laptop I'd spend money on \u2013 and it's all thanks to Nvidia's powerful RTX 5070 Ti\n- I tested an outrageous Acer Predator laptop with Nvidia 5090 GPU, and I wish I could recommend it, but I just can\u2019t at this price\nJasmine is a gaming hardware and tech journalist with an appreciation for all things others dare to call boring or complicated.\nPreviously of GamesRadar and The Mirror, Jasmine has reviewed and covered hundreds of devices from laptops to sound bars, monitors to cameras and almost everything in-between.\nIn her spare time, Jasmine enjoys playing games that make her rage and building PCs, which also makes her rage \u2013 as well as spending time with her three cats.

      "text": "Rumored Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra details shared in major specs dump\n- A leaker has shared a list of rumored specs and prices for upcoming Samsung Galaxy tablets\n- Deallabs writer bill-bil kun shared rumored information about the Galaxy Tab S11, Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, and Galaxy Tab S10 Lite\n- The report, while comprehensive, is light on named sources\nSpecs and details for the next Samsung Galaxy tablets have been revealed in what could be one of the biggest tablet leaks we\u2019ve ever seen.\nAs Notebookcheck reports, a well-known France-based leaker has shared purported details of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11, Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, and Galaxy Tab S10 Lite.\nIf these rumors are anything to go by, Samsung could be planning a big shakeup for its tablet line when it comes time to replace the current-gen Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra.\nThe last time Samsung released an 11-inch tablet with flagship-grade hardware was the Galaxy Tab S9 in 2023 \u2013 there was no \u2018standard\u2019 Galaxy Tab S10 to speak of.\nThe information comes courtesy of a Deallabs report authored by contributor and noted game leaker bill-bil kun, and includes pricing and technical specs for each of the three new models.\nWhile the report doesn't name many of its sources, the information given matches what we'd expect to see from a single-generation upgrade.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S11 and Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra rumored specs\nAccording to these new rumored specs, the Galaxy Tab S11 will sport an 11-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1600, the same size and resolution as the Galaxy Tab S9's screen.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Galaxy S11 Ultra is tipped to get a larger 14.6-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2960 x 1848, which is the same size and resolution as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra\u2019s.\nAs for internals, Deallabs reports that both the Galaxy Tab S11 and Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra will have the MediaTek MT6691 chipset \u2013 this is a code name for the Dimensity 9400 chipset, a powerful flagship-grade mobile chipset. Last year\u2019s Galaxy Tab S10 models used the Dimensity 9300+ chipset, so this seems like a logical upgrade.\nThey also claim the Galaxy Tab S11 will come with 12GB of RAM and an 8400mAh battery, while the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra will have either 12GB or 16GB of RAM, depending on storage configuration, as well as a larger 11,600mAh battery. Both tablets are said to support 45W charging.\nDeallabs says the Galaxy Tab S11 will be available with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage, and the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra with 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage (the latter of which models, they claim, comes with 16GB of RAM).\nAs for other hardware, both tablets are said to feature a 13MP main camera and 12MP selfie camera, four speakers, WiFi 6E (WiFi 7 on the Ultra) and Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity with optional 5G, and an included S Pen.\nMoving on to the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite Deallabs' report lists it as having a 10.9-inch display with a resolution of 2112 x 1320. They say this tablet will get the Exynos 1380 chipset (the same found in the Galaxy Tab S10 FE), an 8000mAh battery with 25W wired charging, an 8MP main camera and 5MP selfie camera, two speakers, and support for WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3.\nThey add that the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite will come in two configurations \u2013 a model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S11 and Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra rumored pricing\nThe report also gives rumored pricing for each model in euros, which we can convert to other currencies for a rough estimate.\nThe Galaxy Tab S11 is said to start at at \u20ac899, which is about $1,050 / \u00a3800 / AU$1,600), the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra at \u20ac1,339 (about $1,600 / \u00a31,150 / AU$2,400), and the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite at \u20ac459 (about $540 / \u00a3400 / AU$800).\nIt's worth highlighting again that all of the above is rumor for now, but if these specs are the real deal we could be looking at some serious new contenders for the title of best tablet on the market.

      "text": "Huawei\u2019s new MatePad has got me thinking: where are all the good cheap tablets?\nI\u2019ll tell you a secret: I hate having to update our best cheap tablets guide. Not because I\u2019m against the idea of affordable tech slates, but because I feel bad about the state of the cheap tablet market in 2025.\nThere are really only a handful of lower-end tablets worth considering at the time of writing, and it\u2019s a challenge to recommend anything other than Apple\u2019s latest entry-level iPad, which, I acknowledge, stretches the definition of \u2018affordable\u2019 for most people.\nI\u2019m mildly relieved, then, that Huawei has announced a refreshed version of its impressive MatePad 11.5 tablet, which is coming to the UK and Europe later this month. This 11.5-inch slate will boast a 120Hz LCD display with a 2.5k resolution, 8GB of RAM, a sizeable 10,100mAh battery, and optional PaperMatte technology \u2013 all decent specs, if Huawei gets the price right.\nOf course, if you\u2019re living in the US, this is useless information. The MatePad 11.5 won\u2019t be getting a truly global release, just as the OnePlus Pad Go and all of Xiaomi and Honor\u2019s budget-friendly tabs are confined to British, European, and Asian markets.\nFor our friends across the pond (I\u2019m writing this from London), the cheap tablet situation boils down to three, maybe four options. If you\u2019re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the iPad 11-inch (2025) is, hands-down, one of the best tablets you can buy, while Android fans should consider the Lenovo Tab or Lenovo Idea Tab Pro. For a truly affordable option, I\u2019d recommend one of Amazon\u2019s cheap and cheerful Fire tablets.\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 never came to the US, and while US folks can buy the larger Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, that device launched almost two years ago, meaning it\u2019s hard to recommend in 2025. There\u2019s still no sign of the Galaxy Tab A10 series.\nSimilarly, the Google Pixel Tablet debuted in May 2023, and we haven\u2019t heard a peep about a potential second-generation model (August\u2019s Made by Google showcase will almost certainly be reserved for the Pixel 10 series and Pixel Watch 4).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt\u2019s nothing new for US buyers to have access to a smaller pool of products than those in other regions \u2013 good luck getting one of the best Xiaomi phones or best Oppo phones in the US \u2013 but the affordable tablet situation feels particularly dire.\nThere are, of course, various strategic, economic, and even political factors at play here, and I\u2019m not going to weigh in on whether those factors are right or wrong. Rather, I\u2019m just drawing attention to a problem I keep encountering when updating our best cheap tablets guide each month: there are very few options worth recommending to a global audience.\nApple\u2019s entry-level iPad is an excellent device, but I\u2019d like to see Google and Samsung have another proper crack at the lower end of the tablet market.\nYou might also like\nAxel is TechRadar's Phones Editor, reporting on everything from the latest Apple developments to newest AI breakthroughs as part of the site's Mobile Computing vertical.

      "text": "The best mobile controllers 2025: upgrade your portable play\nI've tried everything from cheap options to the most premium picks\nOne of the best mobile controllers is essential if you\u2019re serious about mobile gaming. No matter what kind of titles you play, a capable mobile gamepad is likely going to improve your experience. For pad-friendly games like Genshin Impact or Zenless Zone Zero, a mobile controller allows for a much more console-like feel and helps you avoid those smaller touchscreen cramps.\nBut the best mobile controllers are great for more than just comfort. For first-person shooters like Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, a mobile controller can massively improve your precision with accurate thumbsticks and therefore lead to much better performance online. Even those who play retro games using emulators can benefit from a mobile controller, as physical buttons are more faithful to the layouts and feel of old consoles.\nI\u2019m an avid mobile gamer and have tested countless mobile controllers here at TechRadar Gaming, so I\u2019ve put together this guide to help you find the best one for your needs. In addition to evaluating the individual features and performance of each model featured, I\u2019ve also carefully considered the price to ensure that one is truly the best value option in its class.\nBefore I break down my top picks, if you\u2019re looking to really upgrade your mobile play consider grabbing some of the best gaming earbuds to enhance your phone\u2019s audio too.\nI'm a dedicated mobile gamer with almost half a decade of experience writing about games and hundreds of hours spent in Call of Duty: Mobile and Zenless Zone Zero. I've also reviewed tens of mobile controllers for TechRadar. Before joining our gaming team, I worked at the UK's biggest PlayStation magazine and have contributed to the likes of PC Gamer, SFX, and Edge.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nBest overall\nThe Backbone One 2nd Gen is the best overall mobile controller at its price point thanks to its wide compatibility, iconic design, and tactile clicky buttons.\nBest budget\nBest budget\nThe GameSir X2s Type-C is an incredible value mobile controller that offers a comfortable design and reliable controls with few compromises.\nBest premium\nBest premium\nAlthough pricey, the Razer Kishi Ultra is quite simply the ultimate mobile controller right now and worth every cent if you have the budget.\nBest for Call of Duty: Mobile\nBest for Call of Duty: Mobile\nSpeedy thumbsticks and useful rear paddles mean that the Asus ROG Tessen excels as a controller for Call of Duty: Mobile or other fast-paced FPS titles.\nBest Bluetooth\nBest Bluetooth\nThe Turtle Beach Atom is an impressively compact controller and a good choice if you want something that uses a wireless Bluetooth connection.\nBest mobile controllers in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Backbone One 2nd Gen is the overall best mobile controller at the moment and is a fantastic all-round performer. It was the peripheral to popularize the now common extending design, which can slide open to sandwich your phone.\nIt boasts wide compatibility with its Type-C connector, which works readily with both Android and newer iOS devices. With some small rubber adaptors included in the box, it can fit around most phone cases too. You don\u2019t even need to worry if you own an older iPhone, as there are also Lightning connector variants available.\nWhen it comes to performance, there are very few areas where you can fault the Backbone One 2nd Gen. It has robust face buttons with a lovely clicky feel, reliable thumbsticks, and a top-notch d-pad that\u2019s a brilliant fit for 2D platformers. You also get a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is perfect for a wired gaming headset, and an additional Type-C port for passthrough charging - preventing your phones from running dry while you play.\nWhile it works out of the box in a plug-and-play capacity, the compatible Backbone app boasts plenty of great features - including plenty of customization and an in-built game launcher. Just bear in mind that some app features sadly require an additional subscription to access.\nFor PlayStation lovers or those most interested in PS Remote Play, check out the dedicated PlayStation Edition. This variant is the same price as the regular black version but features an all-white design with PlayStation button markings to really channel that DualSense Wireless Controller goodness. The Backbone One 2nd Gen is my go-to travel companion, as it\u2019s small enough to cram in a bag and works wonderfully with a wide range of genres.\n- Read more: Backbone One 2nd Gen review\nBest budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re on a tighter budget, then I highly recommend the GameSir X2s Type-C. This pad has a unique design inspired by the look and feel of the Nintendo 2DS, with a soft and spongy D-pad that will be immediately familiar to anybody who has used that handheld. Like the 2DS, it\u2019s a lot cheaper than the competition and is easy to find at less than half the cost of the Backbone One 2nd Gen.\nIn performance terms, the GameSir X2s Type-C definitely punches above its weight. Its large flat shape makes it very comfortable in the hands, even over long periods of play. It also features Hall effect thumbsticks and triggers, which should help this controller last a lot longer than others.\nEvery game I played, be that the native Android version of Vampire Survivors or Far Cry 5 via Amazon Luna cloud streaming, felt snappy and responsive throughout. This model also boasts a unique movable Type-C connector, which can twist and pivot slightly when plugged into your phone. In practical terms this makes it much easier to attach or remove your device, reducing the chance that you might accidentally damage its charging port.\nThe only major downside of the GameSir X2s Type-C, aside from the annoying lack of a headphone jack, is its build. This is a controller that certainly feels cheap when you take it out of the box, especially if you\u2019re used to more premium peripherals. It\u2019s very lightweight and seems almost hollow in the hands though this isn\u2019t particularly surprising and is acceptable given the low asking price.\n- Read more: GameSir X2s Type-C review\nBest premium\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Razer Kishi Ultra is expensive, but it\u2019s truly the ultimate mobile controller for those with a healthy budget. It\u2019s hands down the best mobile gamepad that I\u2019ve ever used, even today, and offers a simply unparalleled portable gaming experience.\nIt\u2019s supremely comfortable thanks to its full-size grips (which are roughly equivalent in size to each side of the Xbox Wireless Controller) and works with a wide range of both Android and iOS devices - including small tablets like the iPad Mini 6 or iPad Mini 7.\nThe quality of its controls is second to none, with smooth thumbsticks and Hall effect triggers in addition to a set of lovely mechanical buttons. I played a wide range of Apple Arcade titles using an iPad Mini 6 throughout my testing of this model and in every case I was completely blown away. Playing Sonic Dream Team and Honkai: Star Rail was the closest I\u2019ve felt to a portable console experience, beating out even the Nintendo Switch OLED when it came to performance and visual quality. On top of bright RGB lighting, you also get remappable inputs next to the shoulder buttons which are ideal if you want to tinker with different control schemes.\nIf all that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s compatible with the superb Razer Nexus app, which offers a dedicated launcher. It also has a supremely useful virtual controller mode that opens the door to compatibility with software that doesn't otherwise offer dedicated mobile controller support by letting you map on-screen buttons to different inputs. This was a particular blessing in League of Legends: Wild Rift, which is otherwise exclusively playable with touch inputs.\n- Read more: Razer Kishi Ultra review\nBest for Call of Duty: Mobile\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re a dedicated Call of Duty: Mobile or Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile player, then you\u2019re going to need a controller that\u2019s a particularly good fit for first-person shooters. That\u2019s exactly where the Asus ROG Tessen comes in, with quick thumbsticks and shallow triggers that ensure you won\u2019t be let down by your controller when you\u2019re required to react quickly in a match. You also get two durable metal rear paddles, which can be mapped to functions like throwing grenades, reloading, or sliding so you don\u2019t ever have to take your fingers off the trigger.\nLike the Razer Kishi Ultra, the Asus ROG Tessen also features some strong RGB lighting that really adds to its aesthetic. It\u2019s also one of the most portable entries on this list thanks to its overall light weight and a unique folding mechanism which allows you to fold the controller in half for easier storage.\nOne thing I did notice, however, was that the controller could become uncomfortable after playing for a few hours. It has quite angular grips, which I found could dig into my palms over time, though this shouldn\u2019t be a concern if you\u2019re playing games that rely on short, fast-paced matches.\nWith that in mind, the biggest downside of the Asus ROG Tessen is by far its limited compatibility. This is a controller that is exclusively compatible with Android phones, leaving iOS users with alternatives like the Backbone One 2nd Gen.\n- Read more: Asus ROG Tessen review\nBest Bluetooth\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThose after a Bluetooth mobile controller should look no further than the Turtle Beach Atom, which is available in both iOS and Android variants.\nUnlike the other entries on this list, this gamepad relies on wireless Bluetooth rather than a physical connector. This means you don\u2019t have to worry about whether your phone has a Type-C or Lightning connector which makes it a good choice if you\u2019re currently on an older device that you intend to upgrade soon and don\u2019t want to lose access to your peripherals.\nIt\u2019s also super portable, as it comprises two interlocking pieces that can combine together to slip in the included carrying case. Unfortunately, as a Bluetooth device you will have to charge this up separately to your phone - so make sure that you\u2019ve plugged it in for a while before your next big trip. Luckily, its battery life is strong, with roughly 20 hours of juice which should be enough for even the longest of journeys.\nWhile I think the buttons and thumbsticks are good, the D-pad leaves a lot to be desired in my eyes. It\u2019s very flat, which makes it easy to quickly hit inputs if your fingers are on the thumbsticks but makes it a bit uncomfortable to hold down for any period of time. Your mileage with it is really going to come down to what games you play: if it\u2019s something that requires frequent D-pad inputs, then you\u2019re better off with an alternative like the GameSir X2s Type-C.\nOtherwise, with a price roughly on par with the Backbone One 2nd Gen, this is a good Bluetooth alternative.\n- Read more: Turtle Beach Atom review\nFAQs\nWhat is the best controller for mobile?\nThe best controller for mobile is largely going to come down to your own personal needs and budget. Having tested lots of mobile controllers, I think that the Razer Kishi Ultra is the best option on the market - but it is far and away the most expensive option here. The Backbone One 2nd Gen is therefore a great all-rounder, as it comes in at a more affordable price while offering great controls and a decent set of features.\nWhat controller can I use for mobile?\nYou can use lots of different controllers for mobile, including standard standard Bluetooth controllers like the Xbox Wireless Controller. I prefer dedicated mobile controllers, however, as they have been designed specifically for use with a phone. Most also feature a way to hold on to the phone while it\u2019s in use, which makes it much easier to play portably.\nWhat controller is best for Call of Duty: Mobile?\nBased on my hands-on testing, the Asus ROG Tessen is a fantastic fit for Call of Duty: Mobile. It\u2019s fully compatible with the game and compact, making it easy to bring out and about when you\u2019re practicing matches on the go. It also features reliable thumbsticks, quick triggers, and fast, clicky buttons on top of two remappable rear paddles made of a durable metal material. It even has a strip of RGB lighting, giving you the ability to customize its look.\nHow we test the best mobile controllers\nI have personally evaluated each of the mobile controllers featured on this list, in addition to a wide range of others including the Scuf Nomad, original Backbone One, Turtle Beach Recon Cloud, and Mobile Controller MG-X Pro. I\u2019m a dedicated mobile gamer, trying products with a range of different devices.\nI usually play on an iPhone 15 Plus or Samsung S23 Plus, though have also tried mobile gamepads with compatible tablets such as the iPad Mini 5 and Lenovo Legion Tab 3.\nIn addition to writing about games and gaming products for almost half a decade, I also test a wide range of other controllers at TechRadar Gaming, so I\u2019ve garnered plenty of knowledge on what makes a particular controller worth your time and money.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDash is a technology journalist who covers gaming hardware at TechRadar.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Steam Deck is a brilliant gaming device that should appeal to PC gamers looking for a way to play their games while on the go, but who don\u2019t fancy a gaming laptop. For console gamers who want a polished, straightforward experience, knock half a star off our score, but don\u2019t discount the Steam Deck either.\nPros\n- +\nWell built\n- +\nGood performance\n- +\nHuge library of games\n- +\nInnovative and flexible\nCons\n- -\nSlow load times\n- -\nShort battery life\n- -\nSoftware has some quirks\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe Steam Deck launched in February 2022, and since its release, Valve has been regularly updating the gaming handheld to assuage some of the issues users experienced when they first used the system.\nThere are three different storage types available for the Steam Deck - 64GB, 256GB, and 512GB. The 64GB Steam Deck has an eMMC storage card and the 256GB and 512GB Steam Decks are equipped with NVMe SSD, but all three will come with a carrying case for easy and safe travel. Also, the higher your storage capacity goes, the more \u201cextras\u201d you\u2019ll get on or with the Steam Deck.\nIf you want to order a Steam Deck through Valve, you\u2019re going to have to wait until at least October 2022 when order availability opens again. You can currently use your Steam login to make an order reservation, so when inventory is restocked you\u2019ll have 72 hours to complete your Steam Deck purchase.\nWhen the Steam Deck first hit the market, a key complaint was its battery life - or rather lack of it. Valve has improved the Steam Deck experience via software updates that haven\u2019t just been patches, but added to the overall usability, accessibility, and PC game playability of the handheld system.\nSteam Deck: What's been updated?\nValve\u2019s Steam Deck updates have covered everything from bug fixes to controller configuration updates to new framerate display options. Updates have steadily rolled out throughout March and continued into April to make players\u2019 Steam Deck experience even more enjoyable. The most recent update will now allow users to install Windows 11 and create their own lockscreen and pin passcode if they choose.\nThere have been multiple Steam Deck keyboard updates resulting in 21 different languages and various layouts available beyond the standard QWERTY English keyboard. Valve is working on other keyboard layouts as well, including Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. Users can now switch between windows in the same application, like web browser tabs.\nOne issue that hasn\u2019t quite been solved yet is the whine from the Steam Deck\u2019s fan which can be high-pitched and grating, even if it isn\u2019t particularly loud. However, it\u2019s said that the latest Steam Deck update has tried to correct the fan whining, reducing the fan\u2019s pitch and making it run almost silently. The only drawback of the fan update is the slightly raised temperature of the Steam Deck CPU.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Steam Deck\u2019s continual updates show that it\u2019s a handheld system steadily improving from its already impressive reviews. We loved the Steam Deck when we first tested it out in February 2022 despite some of its flaws, so the most recent updates truly showcase the potential of the Steam Deck. Check out our original review below to see if a Steam Deck is a good fit for you.\nSteam Deck: Two-minute review\nThe Steam Deck is one of the most eagerly anticipated product launches in recent times, with Valve trying its hand at making a handheld console.\nIt\u2019s certainly an ambitious task, but one that Valve mostly pulls off. However, as much as you may think the Steam Deck is a Nintendo Switch rival, it\u2019s actually more of an alternative to gaming laptops.\nThis means if you\u2019re a PC gamer with a large Steam library, and you\u2019re used to the quirks and annoyances that come with playing PC games, then you\u2019ll likely love the Steam Deck and overlook its rougher edges.\nHowever, if you\u2019re a console player who\u2019s used to more polished products that keep things as simple and straightforward as possible, you may be disappointed.\nSome of the rough edges of the Steam Deck are a part of its charm, however, and in some cases are due to the flexibility of the device, which traditional consoles just can\u2019t offer. You can plug in pretty much any USB-C hub, hook up a monitor or TV and play games on the big screen. You can also use the Steam Deck in desktop mode, allowing you to install a variety of Linux apps, turning the Steam Deck into a fully-fledged mini PC. You can even install other operating systems, such as Windows 11.\nThis versatility puts the Steam Deck above its traditional competitors, and while people looking for a Nintendo Switch-like experience may not be sold, for PC gamers thinking about getting a gaming laptop, the Steam Deck is a brilliant device with a huge amount of potential, especially for people who like to tweak.\nGame support is one of those rough edges. If you buy a Nintendo Switch game, you can expect it to work on your Nintendo Switch. However, buying a game on Steam doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will run on the Steam Deck. This is mainly due to the Steam Deck running on Linux \u2013 specifically Steam OS 3.0 \u2013 while many Steam games are Windows only. Valve has helped work on a nifty solution, known as Proton, which lets you play games on Linux, but it\u2019s not perfect. And some games \u2013 especially ones using anti-cheat software \u2013 won\u2019t run.\nValve has a simple way of identifying which games can run on the Steam Deck. Games with a green tick in the Steam Library UI means they\u2019re Steam Deck verified, and will run without any issues. Default graphical settings and control options work well, and all menus and text will be legible.\nThere are also games that have yellow ticks. These games are \u2018playable\u2019 but not fully tested, and there may be some issues getting them to run. At the moment, most of your Steam library will likely fall into this category.\nThen, there\u2019s the \u2018Unknown\u2019 category, where there\u2019s not enough information to know how well a game plays. There's also an 'Unsupported' category which means games definitely won't run. This is thankfully relatively small at the moment, and mainly relates to games where you need certain hardware that's not supported on the Steam Deck, such as virtual reality titles. You can check how much of your library is playable on the Steam Deck using Valve\u2019s Steam Deck Compatibility website.\nThis is worth doing, as one of the key selling points for PC gamers is that your Steam library can be played on the Steam Deck, without having to buy your games again. If you have a huge library of Steam games already, the $399 / \u00a3349 starting price becomes much better value.\nWe say \u2018starting\u2019 price, as this is for the entry level model with 64GB of eMMC storage and a carrying case. However, we recommend you invest in the 256GB SSD model, for $529 / \u00a3459, which offers a lot more storage that is also faster.. There\u2019s also a model with 512GB SSD for $649 / \u00a3569, which also comes with anti-glare glass. All models have a microSD card slot to expand storage, which is a nice option, but comes with slower load times for games.\nThe Steam Deck is also solidly built, and while it is large, it isn\u2019t uncomfortable, though you may struggle if you have smaller hands. But what\u2019s amazing about the Steam Deck is the sheer amount of game experiences on offer. It handled the visually stunning God of War without any issue, and it\u2019s a great showcase for indie games. The latter is where the Steam Deck really impresses, with games that are meant to be played in short bursts, and stylish graphics that don\u2019t heavily tax the Steam Deck hardware.\nThe inclusion of a suspend feature, which allows you to quickly resume games whenever you want to play them, is very welcome. Less welcome is the fact that the battery life of the Steam Deck is pretty poor, with it just about managing one and a half hours while playing God of War. For less intensive games, you can expect around four hours.\nSteam Deck: Price and availability\nHere is the Steam Deck configuration sent to TechRadar for review:\nCPU: AMD Zen 2 four core 2.4-3.5GHz\nGraphics: AMD RDNA 2\nRAM: 16GB LPDDR5\nScreen: 7-inch, 1,280 x 800 touchscreen, 60Hz\nStorage: 256GB PCIe SSD\nPorts: USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5\nWeight: 1.47 pounds (0.67kg)\nSize: 11.73 x 4.6 x 1.9 inches (29.8 x 11.7 x 4.9cm; W x D x H)\nThe Steam Deck was originally going to launch December 2021, but Valve announced that it was delaying the launch until February 25, 2022. However, as with many gaming products at the moment, you can\u2019t just go and buy one. Instead, keen buyers have been able to reserve a unit. Due to the huge demand, quick-fingered customers managed to reserve an early unit that will launch on or near February 25.\nAt the time of writing, if you sign up to reserve one now, you won\u2019t get a unit until \u2018after Q2 2022\u2019. This means you could be waiting a while before you can get one. For anyone hoping to buy a Steam Deck instead of waiting for the chance to buy a PS5 or RTX 3080, you'll be disappointed to learn that the Steam Deck is also supply constrained.\nThe Steam Deck comes in three versions: a basic version that sells for $399 / \u00a3349, which comes with 64GB of eMMC storage and a carrying case.\nThe mid-range option costs $529 / \u00a3459 and includes a 256GB NVMe SSD inside for faster storage, a carrying case and an exclusive Steam Community profile bundle. This is the version we had in for review.\nFinally, the highest tier option costs $649 / \u00a3569 and includes 512GB of NVMe SSD internal storage, premium anti-glare etched glass, an exclusive carrying case, exclusive Steam Community profile bundle, and an exclusive virtual keyboard theme.\nWe don\u2019t currently have prices or availability information for Australia, but will add it as soon as we get more information.\nThe main difference between the Steam Deck models is storage capacity. While the base model looks the best value, 64GB of storage is far too low for modern games. God of War, one of the most impressive games you can play on the Steam Deck, for instance, requires 65GB of storage space, which means you won\u2019t be able to run it on the base model.\nThe good news is that every Steam Deck comes with a microSD card reader, so you can expand the storage reasonably easily. This means you\u2019ll probably have to factor in the price of a microSD card when buying the base model, making it not quite as good value as it might first appear.\nHowever, this does make the 256GB version better value, as you have the option of upgrading the storage later, and the NVMe SSD inside the 256GB and 512GB models is much faster than any microSD card you\u2019ll use (especially as the Steam Deck is limited to UHS-I speeds, which peak at 150mb/s).\nThe 512GB model not only comes with twice the storage of the 256GB model, but also a slightly different screen. We got a chance to try out that model as well, and while the anti-glare coating certainly reduces reflections, it\u2019s not enough of a change to justify the higher price. So, the 256GB model remains the Steam Deck we recommend.\nThe Steam Deck is undeniably expensive, with even the base model costing more than the Nintendo Switch, which retails for $299 / \u00a3279.99 / AU$469, and even the new Nintendo Switch OLED, which retails for $349 / \u00a3309.\nNintendo has the edge, then, when it comes to upfront cost, but many multiplatform games will cost less on Steam than for the Nintendo Switch. If you already have a large library of PC games, then you\u2019ll also have a ready-made selection of games that you don\u2019t need to buy again.\nThis is a huge selling point when it comes to PC gamers. It means when we fire up the Steam Deck, we already have hundreds of games at hand.\nCompared to a gaming laptop or PC, the Steam Deck is a lot more affordable. While it\u2019s not as versatile as a traditional laptop or PC, as Valve has been keen to point out, it is essentially a computer. This means you can connect it to a USB dock and use a keyboard, mouse and monitor, and you can use Steam OS 3.0, which is a Linux distro based on Arch Linux, in desktop mode. This gives you a KDE Plasma desktop environment that\u2019s similar to Windows. You can then install other software, like word processing apps. If you want, you can also install other operating systems, such as other Linux distros or even Windows 11.\nSteam Deck: Design\nWhile the Steam Deck is a handheld console, it\u2019s also one of the biggest we\u2019ve used, and is noticeably larger and heavier than the Nintendo Switch. In the run up to its release, Valve claimed that it had spent a lot of time designing the Steam Deck so that it would offer comfortable, extended play sessions.\nThe size certainly takes some getting used to, especially if you\u2019re used to smaller handhelds or traditional game pads, and more frantic games like Hades can feel a bit uncomfortable.\nHowever, the longer we spend with the Steam Deck, the more comfortable it becomes. On the front of the Steam Deck are two thumbsticks on each side of the screen, with capacitive touch sensors built-in, which Valve claims provide \"a level of precision and comfort not found on other portable gaming devices\".\nThey certainly feel robust, responsive and accurate, and are the control method we use the most. Below the thumbsticks are two square trackpads, which offer mouse control for games that require them. They are similar to the trackpad on the Steam Controller, and offer subtle haptic vibrations, which is a nice touch. However, we rarely use them.\nSlightly above the left-hand thumbstick there is a D-Pad, which is handy for 2D and retro games, and in the same position above the right-hand are four buttons: A, B, X and Y, laid out in the same position as on an Xbox controller.\nThere\u2019s also a View button, Menu button, Steam button and Quick access button as well. This sometimes feels a little over the top, as it\u2019s not always clear what the buttons do in certain contexts, and sometimes they double up functionality.\nBut, if you like buttons, you\u2019ll love the Steam Deck! On the top of the Steam Deck there are two volume buttons, a power button, two shoulder buttons (L1 and R1) and two triggers (L2 and R2). There\u2019s also a headphone jack, USB-C port for charging and hooking up a USB hub, and status LED.\nStill not enough buttons for you? Well, the good news is that there are four more on the back. While this certainly gives the Steam Deck a certain amount of versatility, especially when playing PC games that require hotkeys that would usually be found on a keyboard, we never really use them in the games we play. While having more buttons than is necessary is better than not having enough, these extra buttons do sometimes get in the way, as you can accidently hit them when holding or picking up the Steam Deck, which can have unwanted consequences when playing a game.\nAt the front of the Steam Deck there\u2019s also stereo speakers and two microphones, allowing you to speak clearly to your teammates without needing a headset.\nThe Steam Deck has a 7-inch,1,280 x 800 display with a 16:10 aspect ratio. It\u2019s also touchscreen, which adds another nice optional input method. While we don\u2019t use it in games, it\u2019s handy for quickly selecting options in menus.\nThe screen is bigger than the Nintendo Switch\u2019s 6.2-inch display, and the same size as the Switch OLED\u2019s screen. Both Switch models have a resolution of 1280 x 720, so the Steam Deck has a slightly higher vertical resolution. While many games support various aspect ratios, some still stick to 16:9, which means there are black bars along the top and bottom of the Steam Deck\u2019s screen, so you don\u2019t benefit from the extra resolution.\nThankfully, most modern PC games can cope with a variety of resolutions and aspect ratios, so they fit the screen perfectly.\nThe resolution also makes a lot of sense. On a 7-inch screen, it looks sharp and vibrant (not as good as the OLED panel in the latest Switch, however), and the relatively low resolution means games don\u2019t tax the Steam Deck\u2019s hardware too much, potentially leading to better performance and battery life.\nOne thing to point out is that unlike most other handheld consoles, the Steam Deck has fans, with heat exhausts at the top of the console. When the Steam Deck starts working hard, these whirr into life. It\u2019s not the loudest, but it is noticeable, and while PC gamers may not mind, fans of silent handhelds may be a bit put off.\nSteam Deck: Performance\nThe performance of the Steam Deck is a mixed bag, at times seriously impressing us, and other times frustrated. When it comes to the frustrations, a lot of it is due to running an early version of Steam OS, with Valve pushing out updates and fixes almost daily.\nMany game developers are also working on getting their games Steam Deck Verified. These games, which appear in your library with a green tick icon, have been extensively tested on the Steam Deck and offer smooth gameplay, and interface options that are easily readable on the Steam Deck\u2019s screen. If you load one of these up, you\u2019re essentially guaranteed that it will play well on the Steam Deck without having to fiddle around with any settings.\nThe number of Steam Deck Verified games is constantly growing, and includes big releases such as God of War, as well as classics like Portal 2. When we first started reviewing the Steam Deck, Hades \u2013 a brilliant game we thought would be perfectly suited to the Steam Deck \u2013 wasn\u2019t Steam Deck Verified. However, after a couple of days, the developers released an update that made it verified. Even in its unverified state, however, it still played very well.\nThis may be the experience you get for many of the games that are labelled as \u2018Playable\u2019. This means they\u2019ve not yet been verified, but should still run on the Steam Deck. There are some games listed as \u2018Playable\u2019 that run just as well as verified games. However, there are some, such as Monkey Island 2, which have annoying bugs. In the case of the point-and-click LucasArts classic, we can\u2019t load the game past the main menu.\nThere will also be some games that are labeled \u2018Unsupported\u2019. Due to the sheer size of Steam\u2019s library, there will likely be plenty of games that fall under this category, especially more obscure titles. This doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t play at all, but there may be bugs, uncooperative interfaces or text that doesn\u2019t look quite right.\nThankfully, the Steam Deck has plenty of options that allows you to tweak the game to run better. Making some games full screen \u2013 rather than windowed \u2013 and adjusting the resolution makes them run better. There are also numerous pre-made controller options to help you find the best control scheme for a game, especially one that\u2019s not been designed for controller use.\nThis kind of tweaking is part and parcel of PC gaming, so for PC gamers, you may not mind this at all. However, for console gamers who are used to a more polished experience, this could be off putting.\nThe good news is that generally we have no issues playing any games that were Steam Deck Verified, with all the default settings working well. Stick with these if you don\u2019t like messing around with options.\nEven in these early days, the scope of Steam Deck Verified games is impressive, and it\u2019s genuinely a thrill to play a graphically intense game like God of War on a handheld device. To then be able to switch to addictive indie games like Hades and Hotline Miami (which is perfect for the Steam Deck) is a joy, and means the potential of the Steam Deck is extremely exciting.\nWe did knock God of War down from \u2018Ultra\u2019 settings to \u2018High\u2019, for more consistent performance, and on the 7-inch screen it looks phenomenal, it never dips below 30 fps, and mainly stays around 40 fps.\nHowever, while impressive, it\u2019s clearly not a game with handheld play in mind. Similarly, some first person shooters felt cumbersome, but that may be because we much prefer keyboard and mouse for those types of games.\nBut fast and frantic games you can pick up and play for short bursts (like the aforementioned Hades and Hotline Miami) really work well. By tapping the Power button the Steam Deck goes into suspend mode. When pressing power again, the Steam Deck turns on in a couple of seconds, and you\u2019re right back where you were.\nThis is a great touch that adds to the appeal for the Steam Deck. Quick resume is something console gamers are now quite used to, but not on PC. One game that was a particularly pleasing surprise on the Steam Deck is Portal 2. Valve\u2019s iconic physics-bending FPS puzzler \u2013 from back when Valve actually made games \u2013 has been given a new lease of life here. While we mentioned that some FPS games don\u2019t quite feel like they fit on the Steam Deck, Portal 2 works brilliantly. In part it\u2019s because it\u2019s a slower-paced game that emphasizes problem solving over quick reflexes, but also because the game is essentially made up of short, separate, puzzles, making it ideal for picking up and playing when you\u2019re traveling, for example. Even though it\u2019s an older game, it still looks fantastic, and it\u2019s been a real joy to return to this game after so long. As it\u2019s a Valve title, it may not come as a surprise that this is Steam Deck Verified.\nPerformance isn\u2019t perfect, however, and even on less graphically intense games, there can occasionally be stuttering. But, on the whole, performance is good and we have a feeling that these little hitches will be ironed out as Steam OS, Proton (the tool that allows Windows games to run on Linux) and games themselves are updated.\nValve has made a big deal of the Steam Deck being essentially a handheld PC, and for good reason. You can switch from Big Picture mode (the default setting) to a desktop view of SteamOS 3. And from here you can install and use other applications. These can be installed either via a web browser, or through the Discover Software Center.\nThis allows you to use the Steam Deck as a full-fledged PC, and there\u2019s a huge range of applications you can use on SteamOS, thanks to a committed community of open source developers. You can also hook the Steam Deck up to a USB hub, and connect a mouse, keyboard and monitor to it, making it viable to use as a mini desktop PC. It\u2019s impressive stuff, and it\u2019s great that Valve is committed to openness and flexibility, as you can use pretty much any USB-C hub, rather than expensive proprietary accessories.\nUnlike the Nintendo Switch, however, docking the Steam Deck doesn\u2019t offer any performance improvements, and when you use a high resolution screen, such as a 4K TV, the hardware limitations of the Steam Deck are more apparent. Still, it allows you to play games on the big screen with a keyboard and mouse, and again, the results are very good.\nLinux, especially an Arch-based distro, isn\u2019t the most user-friendly operating system for beginners, however, so if you\u2019re not used to it, you\u2019ll probably want to keep the Steam Deck in Steam Big Picture mode. When in desktop mode, everything you do is kept separate, which means major updates to Steam OS shouldn\u2019t wipe out your work. However, there\u2019s always the danger when playing around in Linux that you break something, needing a factory reset.\nYou can also install Windows 11 on the Steam Deck. This gives you a greater choice of games, as you\u2019ll be able to install non-Steam Windows-only games from developers like Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard, who don\u2019t publish on Steam. At the time of this review, Windows 11 support was a bit flakey with some driver issues, but, again, this is something that will likely improve in time thanks to continued updates.\nEven with our 256GB model with a solid state drive, load times for games were quite long. Coming from a gaming PC with a super-speedy SSD (or a console like the PS5) makes the load times a noticeable chore. It\u2019s worse when using a microSD, as speeds are limited to UHS-I, which is around 104MB/s. This is far slower than any SSD, and for large games can introduce longer load times.\nFrom the SSD, Portal 2 \u2013 a rather old game now \u2013 took 51 seconds to load to the menu, and a further 23 seconds to load up our saved game. That\u2019s a total of 1 minute and 14 seconds to go from launching the game to getting to play it. While that may not seem like a huge amount when written down, it certainly feels like it when you\u2019re using the Steam Deck and waiting for a game to load.\nLoad times are less of an issue for older titles or indie games. The Steam Deck also has a neat workaround in the form of the aforementioned Suspend option. Waking up the Steam Deck loads into the game you were playing with your progress intact in a matter of seconds.\nThis makes picking up and playing a game for a quick blast on the Steam Deck really appealing, especially for PC gamers who would usually have to turn on their PC, wait for Windows to boot, then load up a game. It also means, apart from that initial load, or when reloading a save due to dying, the \u2018Suspend\u2019 feature means load times are a non-issue. It\u2019s also not a huge drain on the battery \u2013 it lost 8% while being suspended for 16 hours while we were using it.\nValve has also added a feature during our time with the Steam Deck where it\u2019s possible to run multiple apps at once. This could be handy for playing music apps while also playing games, but it also means you can run two games at once, and switch between them without loading.\nThis obviously puts more strain on the Steam Deck, especially the RAM and battery, and there\u2019s even a warning message when you attempt to launch a second game that explains it could impact performance, but hopefully as the software matures for the Steam Deck, having two games open at once will be less of a resource hog.\nGames on the 7-inch screen look good, especially 2D games, with titles like Hades looking bright and vibrant. While the reflection-resistant screen of the top-end 512GB version is certainly very nice, we found the standard screen to be perfectly fine. Audio quality from the two speakers was a pleasant surprise, however, with a decent amount of punch and stereo separation. You can of course use headphones (either via audio jack or Bluetooth) as audio output as well.\nOverall performance of the Steam Deck impressed us, with it handling both graphically impressive AAA titles and indie games well. Due to the form factor and overall hardware, we found the Steam Deck to particularly excel at indie games that you can pick up and play, rather the cinematic games or titles with overly complex controls.\nSteam Deck: Battery Life\nUnfortunately during our time with the Steam Deck, battery life is an issue. When playing God of War, the Steam Deck lasts just one and a half hours on battery, below the two hour minimum Valve claims. Obviously, this is a particularly intensive game, but it means playing games for long periods of time without charging the Steam Deck isn\u2019t possible.\nThat\u2019s going to upset a lot of people who may have been planning on using the Steam Deck for long flights, for example. There are things you can do to prolong the Steam Deck, such as turning down settings or using a battery pack, and because it charges via USB-C it should be easy to charge it a bit when needed, but it certainly makes this portable gaming system feel less\u2026 well, portable.\nPC gamers who have had to put up with dire battery lives in gaming laptops for years will be nodding sagely at this point. After all, if you want something small yet powerful enough to play modern games, battery life is going to take a hit. For console gamers used to longer battery lives in their handhelds, though, an hour and a half is going to sting.\nThe good news is that when playing less intensive games, battery life is much better, with 2D games giving us hours of enjoyment over multiple play sessions.\nIf you keep your expectations in check, then, the Steam Deck\u2019s battery life isn\u2019t too much of a disaster, but if you want to play AAA games for hours on end, you\u2019ll need a charger.\nBuy it if...\nYou have a huge Steam library\nGot loads of games on Steam already? Then the Steam Deck will come with a huge variety of games you can play straight away.\nYou don\u2019t like gaming laptops\nGaming laptops aren\u2019t for everyone, but the Steam Deck offers you the ability to play your PC games in a more portable form factor.\nYou like flexibility\nThe Steam Deck is impressively open when it comes to hardware and software. You can use third party hubs and peripherals easily, install Linux desktop apps and even install alternate operating systems.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou love Nintendo\nWhile the Steam Deck resembles the Switch in some ways, it actually offers quite a different experience. And, while Xbox and some PlayStation games are on Steam, Nintendo doesn\u2019t do PC games.\nYou want long battery life\nThe Steam Deck\u2019s biggest issue is its battery life. Realistically, you\u2019re going to get two to three hours of play on a single charge.\nFirst reviewed February 2022\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Core Tech, looking after computing and mobile technology.
