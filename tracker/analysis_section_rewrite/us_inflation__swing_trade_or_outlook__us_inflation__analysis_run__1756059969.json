      "feedback": "This draft strengths lie in a clear regime frame and an explicit macro–labor/automation narrative, but it fails the required four-line Movers & Scenarios format, muddles the causal chain with overly long phrasing, and under-anchors probabilities and claims to the actual IDs in the source material. Actionable edits: restructure to exactly four lines for Movers & Scenarios, with 2 Ups and 2 Downs, each line fitting: Up/Down | Time window (0–3 months or 3–6 months) | Driver/Mechanism (compact 2–4 words) | What to watch (1–2 concise items, plus an explicit invalidation trigger) | Probability % (grounded to evidence and cited with IDs after the line). Do not mix 0–3 weeks or longer narrative content; keep each line tight and one idea per line. Tie every numeric claim or probability to present IDs (e.g., NL5YYTLF2; IGP1Q4ZEJ; 11; WTNT85IPR; S15934PBQ; U6HXAJR4J; F8GF45MEU; J99EM2TPZ; RHXDOHQQX; 37UZC9X8I; 65UUBU0OR) and remove any references to non-ID sources (e.g., “Scraped Source 4/Source 2”). In the What to watch, embed explicit invalidation rules (e.g., “if tariff path escalates or policy credibility collapses” for Down lines) and the triggers that would flip the scenario. For the Trade/Outlook Plan, ensure you provide a single Swing Trade line if the asset is tradable, with: Direction, Horizon, Entry, Stop, Target, Risk/Reward, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability, and Confidence, all anchored to IDs; if not tradable, deliver one concise Outlook line with Direction, Horizon, Expected path/levels, Decision signals, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability, Confidence, again citing IDs. Finally, tighten the narrative to aFirst-Principles chain (automation exposure → labor-margin dynamics → policy design → asset pricing) in a single, coherent thread, and normalize the language so each line is equally crisp, evidence-backed, and free of duplicative or narrative filler.",
