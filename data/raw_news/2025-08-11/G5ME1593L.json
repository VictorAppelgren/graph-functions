  "description": "Rising colorectal cancer cases in younger people highlight the importance of recognizing symptoms like persistent abdominal pain, blood in stool and bowel changes.",
  "content": "Colorectal cancer rates have soared among younger Americans, new research has found \u2014 and there might not always be obvious symptoms.\n\nThe lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is one in 24 for men and one in 26 for women, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nIt is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the fourth in women, but is the second most common cause when the numbers for men and women are combined.\n\nACTOR WITH COLORECTAL CANCER SHARES SIMPLE SIGN THAT HE IGNORED: \u2018I HAD NO IDEA\u2019\n\nWhile there may be no symptoms of CRC before diagnosis, especially in the early stages, the following signs and symptoms should not be overlooked, experts say.\n\nAccording to the Colorectal Cancer Alliance, some symptoms of the disease can be similar to other causes, like hemorrhoids, infection or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nBut a change in bowel habits \u2014 including diarrhea, constipation, narrow stools or feeling like your bowels are full even after a movement \u2014 can be a sign of CRC.\n\nCOLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSES SOAR AMONG YOUNGER ADULTS FOR ONE KEY REASON\n\nFight Colorectal Cancer, a leading patient advocacy group, noted on its website how bowel movements can change due to diet, infections, medications and other medical issues.\n\nA change in bowel movement schedule or stool appearance could also signal CRC.\n\nFight CRC recommends calling a doctor if your stool is consistently abnormal, if you have sudden urges to pass stool but can\u2019t control it, if the stool is black, clay-colored, red or white, or if there is mucus or pus in the stool.\n\nSkinny, thin or pencil-like stool may also indicate an obstruction in the colon, like a tumor, but can also be caused by other harmless, temporary conditions.\n\nPersistent discomfort in the abdomen is another CRC symptom, the Colorectal Cancer Alliance reported on its site.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis can include feelings of pain, nausea, cramping, bloating or feeling unusually full, even after not eating much.\n\nSevere, \"knife-in-my-stomach type\" abdominal pains warrant a visit to the emergency room, Fight CRC instructed \u2014 but even mild pains shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.\n\nBlood in the stool, toilet or when wiping with toilet paper can be a major sign of colorectal cancer.\n\nFight CRC stressed that any amount of rectal bleeding is not normal and should be brought to a doctor\u2019s attention for proper diagnosis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\nSince blood in the stool is a common symptom, Fight CRC instructed paying attention to where the blood is found, how often it occurs and whether bowel movements are painful.\n\nUnexplained weight loss can sometimes be caused by cancer and should be brought to the attention of a doctor, according to the Colorectal Cancer Alliance.\n\nWeight loss is the result of cancer cells \"consuming the body\u2019s energy\" as they multiply, Fight CRC explained, as the immune system expends more energy to fight and destroy cancer cells.\n\nThis can also lead to feeling fatigue, weakness or shortness of breath.\n\nThese symptoms may also be a sign of anemia, which can develop from bleeding somewhere inside the body, like from a cancerous tumor.\n\nWeight loss can also be caused by a tumor blocking the colon or intestinal tract, which prevents proper nutrient absorption.",

      "text": "Updated cancer screening guidance has reportedly caused a spike in diagnoses among younger Americans.\nAccording to two studies by the American Cancer Society (ACS), there\u2019s been a recent surge in colorectal cancer in people aged 45 to 49.\nACS scientists found that after 15 years of stable colorectal cancer (CRC) trends, U.S. diagnoses of local-stage disease skyrocketed in this age group from 2019 to 2022 \u2014 including a 50% relative increase from 2021 to 2022.\nPROSTATE CANCER SCREENING AFTER 70: EXPERTS QUESTION GUIDANCE AFTER BIDEN'S DIAGNOSIS\n\"It is promising news, because the uptick in cases is likely due to first-time screening in the wake of new recommendations for younger, average-risk adults to begin testing for colorectal cancer earlier,\" lead author Elizabeth Schafer, an associate scientist and cancer researcher at ACS, commented in a press release.\nIn 2018, ACS lowered the recommended age for CRC screenings from 50 to 45. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) enforced the same guidance in 2021.\nIn the first study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the researchers analyzed CRC diagnoses from 2004 to 2022 among adults aged 20 to 54, sorted by age, location and stage at diagnosis.\n'WESTERN DIET' BLAMED FOR GROWING RISK OF GI CANCERS AMONG YOUNG ADULTS\nDiagnoses have increased by 1.6% each year since 2004 in the 20 to 39 age group, and by more than 2% annually since 2012 in those aged 40 to 44 and 50 to 54.\nA 1.1% annual increase in people 45 to 49 years old accelerated to 12% per year from 2019 to 2022.\nThe ACS confirmed the increase was driven by the detection of local-stage tumors, which increased by nearly 19% each year for colon cancer and more than 25% for rectal cancer in that timeframe.\nBefore this period, colon cancer detection rates had been stable, and rectal cancer detection rates had been declining.\nRARE CANCER DIAGNOSES SURGE DRAMATICALLY AMONG MILLENNIALS AND GEN X\nAdvanced-stage disease also continues to steeply increase, ACS reported, rising from 1.7% to 2.9% annually since 2004 among adults under 45 and \"even more rapidly\" in the past 10 years in those aged 45 to 54.\nThese findings led to another ACS study, also published in JAMA, which found that CRC screening among U.S. adults between 45 and 49 increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023.\nThe scientists analyzed the data of more than 50,000 individuals to compare changes in screening. They found that CRC screening, which was at 20% in 2021, jumped to 37% in 2023.\nAmong 45- to 49-year-olds, colonoscopy screening increased by 43%, and stool-based testing increased more than five times from 2019 to 2023.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nLead author Jessica Star, associate scientist at ACS in Atlanta, considers it \"thrilling\" to see this increase in screening among younger individuals, as it's likely linked to earlier-stage diagnoses.\n\"However, we still have a long way to go,\" she said in the release. \"Screening for colorectal cancer in ages 45 to 49 remains suboptimal, and has not increased equitably by both educational attainment and insurance status.\"\nPaul E. Oberstein, M.D., medical oncologist and assistant director of the Pancreatic Cancer Center at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center, said the increase in screening is \"successful in detecting more cancers at an early stage where the chance of cure is very high.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"This ultimately should mean that fewer people are diagnosed later in life and fewer people have advanced colon cancer,\" Oberstein, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.\n\"This study reinforces the need to focus research on understanding the causes of colon cancer increases \u2013 and possible steps to reduce these cases.\"\nThe rate of colon cancer in those under 45 remains \"substantially lower,\" he noted, \"so it is not clear yet if universal screening at a younger age is beneficial.\"\nSome specific patients who are younger than 45 may benefit from earlier screening, however, such as those with a family history or personal risk factors, the oncologist added.\nEXERCISE PROGRAM REDUCES COMMON CANCER RECURRENCE AND BOOSTS SURVIVAL\nAs colon cancer continues to increase in younger individuals, Oberstein recommends contacting a doctor if any concerning symptoms are noticed.\nDr. Craig Eagle, chief medical officer of Guardant Health in California, added that early detection is \"crucial,\" noting that the five-year survival rate for CRC is over 90% when the disease is caught in early stages.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\"[This] plummets to 13% in late stages when symptoms usually appear,\" Eagle, who also was not involved in the research, told Fox News Digital.\n\"The rise in diagnoses for those in their 40s is an alarming reminder that screening must be easier and more accessible to reach the 50 million Americans who remain unscreened.\""

I was doing the cold plunge,\" he said. \"I was in amazing cardiovascular shape, and I had stage 3 cancer, and I had no idea.\"\nCOLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSES SOAR AMONG YOUNGER ADULTS FOR ONE KEY REASON\nThe one symptom that he did experience was a change in bowel movements, which the actor chalked up to an effect of his coffee consumption.\n\"Before my diagnosis, I didn\u2019t know much about colorectal cancer,\" van der Beek said. \"I didn\u2019t even realize the screening age [had] dropped to 45; I thought it was still 50.\"\nHe ultimately underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed that the actor had stage 3 colon cancer.\nProfessor Eitan Friedman, M.D., Ph.D., an oncologist and founder of The Suzanne Levy-Gertner Oncogenetics Unit at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, confirmed that changes in bowel habits is the primary red flag that should raise the suspicion of colorectal cancer.\nOthers include fatigue as a result of anemia, blood in stool, weight loss, loss of appetite and abdominal discomfort, Friedman, who has not treated van der Beek, told Fox News Digital.\n\"I was in amazing cardiovascular shape, and I had stage 3 cancer, and I had no idea.\"\nDr. Erica Barnell, M.D., Ph.D., a physician-scientist at Washington University School of Medicine \u2014 and co-founder and chief medical officer at Geneoscopy \u2014 noted that van der Beek\u2019s experience of having no \"glaring\" signs is common.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Many colorectal cancers develop silently, without obvious symptoms,\" Barnell, who also did not treat the actor, told Fox News Digital. \"By the time symptoms appear, the disease may already be advanced.\"\nSymptoms are \"especially worrisome\" for those 45 and older who have at least one first-degree relative with colon cancer or other GI malignancies, and those with active inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease, added Friedman, who is also an advisory board member at SpotitEarly, a startup that offers an at-home breath test to detect early-stage cancer signals.\nEarly detection is key\nThe overall chance of an average-risk person getting colorectal cancer over a lifetime is 4% to 5%, according to Friedman.\n\"Colonoscopy at age 45 onwards, at five- to 10-year intervals, has been shown to lead to early detection of polyps that have the potential to become malignant, and to allow for their removal as an effective means of minimizing the risk of malignant transformation,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nUnfortunately, Barnell noted, \"screening compliance in the U.S. remains below national targets, and gaps are widest in rural, low-income and minority communities.\"\nTo help close those gaps, she called for greater access to \"accurate, noninvasive screening technologies,\" along with efforts to increase public awareness.\n\"Most people don\u2019t like talking about bowel habits, but paying attention to changes can save your life,\" Barnell said. \"Screening gives us the chance to find problems early \u2014 often before you feel sick \u2014 and that can make all the difference.\"\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\nFox News Digital reached out to van der Beek\u2019s representative for comment."
