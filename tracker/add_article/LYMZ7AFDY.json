      "summary": "The upcoming U.S. August jobs report is expected to influence expectations of Fed rate cuts, with market sentiment already pricing in a 25‑bp cut in September and 55‑bp easing by December. Strong equity gains have lifted the S&P 500 to record highs, buoyed by AI optimism, while the Fed’s political turbulence over Governor Cook’s removal has raised concerns about central‑bank independence. Investors weigh a potentially softer labor market against the possibility of aggressive rate cuts, which could support the economy and the stock market. The market remains cautious given September’s historical weakness for the S&P 500.",
