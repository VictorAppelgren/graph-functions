      "feedback": "Overall, the draft effectively anchors a regime-based, first-principles narrative and uses a credible set of drivers (AI infra, tariffs, geopolitics, and capex) with several numeric anchors; however, it currently violates the Movers constraint by including an extra Outlook line, and the Swing Trade/Outlook plan is not cleanly separated from the movers. Actionable edits: (1) Restrict Movers to exactly 4 lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with tight 0–2m, 2–4m, 0–3m, and 4–6m horizons, each underpinned by a single, testable driver and a concise watchpoint drawn from the cited facts (e.g., Nvidia/AI momentum STBVARD8F; tariff regime SGB2PAZGK; Middle East/NBX9RA9WX NBX9RA9WX; Costa/Disney signals U3ZK13ZQI). Remove the extra Outlook line from the movers and place the Trade/Outlook Plan after the four lines. (2) For probabilities, keep the evidence-based anchors but ensure they sum sensibly and attach the relevant ID after each mover line (e.g., 50% STBVARD8F; 25% SGB2PAZGK; 20% I2SJU04DF/NBX9RA9WX; 15% STBVARD8F/U3ZK13ZQI). (3) Tighten the first-principles causal chain upfront: state a one‑sentence base-case—Regime A drives domestic capex in AI/semis/data centers, boosting productivity and real returns, which supports higher AI/infra multiples and a regime-dependent re-pricing of risk premia. Then map each line’s driver to that chain. (4) Strengthen the Watchlist/invalidations by spelling explicit triggers: e.g., Regime shift to B/C requires tariff relaxation or a sustained inflation pivot; geopolitical escalation or Costa/Disney milestones must cross explicit thresholds to invalidate the base-case timing. (5) The Swing Trade plan, if the asset is tradable, should be 1–2 lines appended after the movers with concrete entry/stop/target, R/R, invalidation, and a trigger anchored to the cited regime signals; if not tradable, present a single concise Outlook line with horizon and expected path, still anchored to the regime narrative and citations. (6) Audit all non-obvious claims against sources (e.g., 945 TWh by 2030 STBVARD8F; 10% baseline tariffs and 34% reciprocity SGB2PAZGK; episodic 145% levels) and cite accordingly; relocate Ford/KO/Coca‑Cola specifics to a watchlist rationale rather than core movers to avoid misalignment.",
