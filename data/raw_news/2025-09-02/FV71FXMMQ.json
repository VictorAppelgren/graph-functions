  "title": "Best Washing Machines for Your Home in 2025",
  "description": "Whether you prefer a top-load washer or a front-loader, CNET's experts have identified the best washing machines you can buy today.",
  "content": "The best washing machines can turn laundry day from a hassle to a breeze. Finding the right machine for your household involves reviewing trusted brands like LG, GE and more. But since you can't try washers before buying, picking one requires careful consideration or a recommendation from a trusted source.\n\nThat\u2019s where our CNET experts come in. We\u2019ve tested the leading models, focusing on key factors like their cleaning performance, water efficiency, available cycles and their noise levels to help you find the best washing machine for your needs. We'll cover every spec, from capacity to smart features that integrate with your home network.\n\nIt's not always about the features that you most regularly use, but about having features available that you might sometimes need to use. If available features are driving your comparative shopping experience for washing machines, GE offers a top-tier, front-loading model with consistent customer satisfaction and just about every available add-on. While it is more expensive than the models listed above, it's less expensive than other models that offer as many features as it does. This washing machine offers 5 cubic feet of space, is smart-technology enabled and comes with an impressive range of 12 standard cycles, including a quick wash cycle and a sanitize function for items such as towels and gym clothes that can commonly attract mildew through moisture. A steam option is also available to help vaporize deep stains, an automatic detergent dispenser measures for you based on the size of the load, and a venting feature allows the washing machine to dry out between cycles even with its door closed. In a sea of otherwise white, black, and stainless steel machines, this GE washer is also, refreshingly, navy blue. Because of the many features, this model sports a more complex control panel -- a combination of digital and manual dials -- but one I found intuitive and easy to adjust. It has a sleek, modern look and is available in white or sapphire blue.\n\u2022 Best Buy rating: 4.5 out of 5 based on 1,030 reviews\n\nI researched the washing machines on this list by analyzing specs and user reviews from major appliance retailer sites such as Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe's. I also considered their best-selling and top-rated models, and the available features compared to price as a measure of each machine's overall value. I focused primarily on those models that had a rating of at least 4.5 stars with at least 500 reviews, or at least the highest rating among the highest number of ratings for the feature or size I was evaluating. Most modern washing machines are Energy Star certified by the EPA. Only washing machines that were Energy Star Certified by the EPA were considered, for peace of mind concerning energy use and water efficiency. I dove deep into user comments and ratings to ensure there were no recurring problems, issues, or complaints among a particular brand or model. I looked for evidence of various models' ability to treat heavy stains, and for those who had especially positive commentary on delicate cycles that actually treated delicate fabrics delicately. We didn't do extensive hands-on testing for this list of best washing machines, but I was able to examine several models in various appliance showrooms to get a feel for each unit, and the intuitiveness of its control panel, dials and knobs.\n\nFactors to consider when buying a washing machine The space you have available to accommodate a washing machine is the first consideration toward buying one. Most washing machines are between 24 and 29 inches wide, with variable depths that are typically between 24 and 34 inches. Capacity and size generally go hand-in-hand, with typical models offering you about 4.5 cubic feet of space for your textiles. Extra large capacity models are generally anything above 5 cubic feet, and if you're working with a narrower space in your home, expect to find a washer that only has about 3 cubic feet of space or less. You may have to send out your large comforters and winter coats, but you'll still be able to do average loads of laundry comfortably. I looked for intuitive controls and settings when evaluating washing machines. Washing machines typically come as top-loading or front-loading models. Top-loading models tend to have larger capacities and utilize an agitator -- a central column that moves your clothes around -- to scrub your laundry. Front-loading models may have slightly less capacity and generally work with an impeller, which helps rotate your clothing around the basin so that the clothes rub up against each other for stain removal. One Whirlpool model has a removable agitator for versatility and the potential of even extra capacity. Top-loading models can be a little easier on the back, as they require less bending to load and unload, but are not as readily available as stackable options with a dryer if you don't have space to accommodate a washer and dryer side-by-side. Most washing machines come in white, black or stainless steel finishes, with white usually the least expensive option. This Samsung washer uses artificial intelligence and data to choose a cycle for each load. Even basic model washing machines tend to have at least normal, delicate, and heavy-duty cycles, which automatically adjust the heat, water level, and length of cycle settings. Some machines may have pre-set cycles for color loads versus white loads, and then there's a reliable permanent press, which is typically a cycle setting for synthetic materials that are minimally wrinkly. More expensive and digital models tend to have a larger variety of cycle settings, including ones that are specific for bedding or towels, ones that use steam to manage allergens such as pet dander and dust or a sanitized cycle that can help manage mildewed items. You'll typically be using the same couple of settings regularly, so keep that in mind when deciding how much money you want to spend on a washing machine.\n\nHow much do washing machines cost? On average, washing machines run between $600 and $900. There are units on either side of that average if you're looking for either a very basic model to get the job done or a tricked-out washer with every available feature. (Remember that the self-loading washing machine does not as of yet exist.) How long should a washing machine last? Washing machines, similar to many major appliances, are built to last about 10 years. If you have a small household or only use your washing machine minimally, that may extend its utility for a few more years. Taking care of it and cleaning it will also help extend a washing machine's life. Read CNET's tips for how and how often to clean your washing machine. What is the difference between a front-loading and a top-loading washing machine? The difference between front-loading and top-loading washing machines is capacity, with top-loading washing machines typically having more space for your loads of laundry. Beyond that, top-loaders are typically easier on the back and require less bending than front-loading models, but are more difficult for children to access. What does High Efficiency mean in a washing machine? High Efficiency is separate from Energy Star certification, but both should give you peace of mind concerning your washing machine's energy and water usage. High Efficiency specifically governs water usage, with models that typically require less detergent and use less water than older models that are not indicated as High Efficiency. Check out CNET's tips for laundry habits that can help save on your energy bill. Should I get a washing machine warranty and how important is it? A washing machine should last about 10 years without the need for any major repairs. Most manufacturer warranties cover replacement parts and labor for one year from the date of purchase, designed to protect you if you've unassumingly purchased a damaged or defective unit, plus 10 years for your washer's direct drive motor, where applicable. Extended warranty or third-party options are also available for an additional cost.",

      "text": "The Energy Star label has been the official US designation for appliances with low energy requirements since the program was first introduced by President George Bush in 1992. The label helps people save money while reducing the electrical burdens on their homes, and now it's at risk under President Donald Trump.\nOn Tuesday, May 6, CNN reported that, under the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency is planning its \"next phase of organizational improvements,\" which includes the elimination of the Energy Star program.\nEnergy Star ratings aren't only for refrigerators and heat pumps -- they also apply to home devices like smart plugs and thermostats. Given how much extra energy smart devices can tap, those ratings are important for managing electricity use around your home.\n\"Heating and cooling your home is likely your largest energy expense,\" said Energy Trust of Oregon when I asked about key savings spots. \"Using a smart thermostat to save a little energy every day can really add up. That's especially true if paired with other energy-saving changes like making sure your home is properly insulated, sealing any gaps or cracks around doors, windows and ducts, or switching to an energy-efficient heat pump.\"\nIf you're looking for energy-saving options like these, here are the best brands and devices with Energy Star certification.\nSmart thermostats\nWhile smart thermostats tend to have LED displays and touchscreens, they're designed to use little power and often turn off when no one is active nearby, saving energy. Models with Energy Star certification include Nest thermostats, Sensi models, some Ecobee thermostats, and thermostats from Honeywell Home.\nBecause thermostats tie into heating and cooling, they not only save electricity in their own right but can also save a whole lot of energy for the rest of your home, too. That makes them an excellent place to start cutting down on energy use.\nLight Fixtures\nLight fixtures refer to lights that are wired into a home, instead of light bulbs that you replace. Smart home brands make several smart fixtures like these with Energy Star ratings, including models from our top picks like Philips, Wiz and many more. Take a look at this Philips recessed light kit to learn more, like how you can control it and change colors with an app.\nLight strings\nLight strings are typically more decorative than fixtures, with smart features that allow them to change between many different color schemes. We have several examples from brands like Philips, Nanoleaf and Govee. You can find Energy Star string lights in most holiday sections or stores, just look for that blue star logo when you buy.\nDehumidifiers\nDehumidifiers are a godsend for wetter climates, but they can use up large amounts of electricity, especially when they have to work for hours at a time. Energy Star models will help keep running costs low, while smart picks from Homelabs, Frigidaire, Carrier, Honeywell Home and more can be controlled with apps or even connected to your smart thermostat for automation.\nAir conditioners\nYou can check out smaller air conditioners on our list of the best portable air conditioners and our top picks for window AC units. When the days get hot, devices like these can use immense amounts of electricity working to keep things cool.\nLook for models with smart features, like the ability to control remotely via app and voice assistants, and Energy Star ratings. Even better, look for models certified \"most efficient\" from brands like Midea, LG, Hisense, Gradient and others.\nSmart TVs\nToday's smart TVs can serve as home hubs and even give you live views through your security cameras on demand. But they can also use a lot of power, especially if left on for long periods of time, along with other entertainment equipment. A smart plug can help with power control, but a work-free start is to look for TVs that have Energy Star ratings. Brands like LG and Samsung are great places to begin your search.\nWater heaters\nWater heaters can be surprisingly smart, too, with tools like Aquanta's controller and similar equipment that monitor and automatically optimize water heating, much like smart thermostats do for temperature. You can enhance the savings even more by choosing an Energy Star model from brands like American Standard, ACIQ, Friedrich and Rheem. Or you can really lean into savings by switching to a tankless or solar water heater.\nEnergy monitoring devices\nEnergy Star also incorporates broad systems called SHEMS or Smart Home Energy Management Systems, which use technology to unite many Energy Star devices (thermostats, lighting, smart meters, monitor add-ons, security systems, etc.) and put them all under one automated energy use plan to save electricity.\nTechnically, SHEMS are turnkey systems you'd discuss with an authorized smart home installer. However, you can make your own version with an Emporia Energy Monitoring device and associated Emporia smart plugs, or look up smart meter options with your local utility.\nEV chargers\nFinally, if you have a home EV charger or are interested in installing one, note that these garage devices can also have Energy Star ratings. EV chargers from brands (AC and DC) like Schumacher, Pando Electric, ChargePoint, Legrand, Tesla, EvoCharge and many others can qualify to help you save even more.\nFor more smart money management, review how smart thermostats can save you energy, how to use a smart home to save on electricity bills and how home security can give you discounts every month."

      "text": "American families are facing a lot at the moment: expensive groceries, fluctuating gas prices, back-to-school shopping, and an ongoing uptick in utility bill costs due to increased air conditioning useage this summer. These things might leave you wondering how you can save some money around the house.\nLowering your energy and water bills is one option, and your laundry room is a good place to start. Washing machines and dryers can use a lot of water and electricity (or gas, if you have a gas dryer), particularly if you have an older model in your home. If you typically wash weekly loads of towels, bedding and clothes, you might notice your monthly bills are consistently expensive. But there are several things you can do to help save money in the laundry room -- no handwashing or line-drying of clothes required.\nHere are some simple changes you can make to lower your washer and dryer's energy consumption. For more ways to save around the house, start by unplugging your appliances and consider what temperature you should set your thermostat to this summer to save big.\nWash your clothes on cold\nUnless a clothing label specifies a certain temperature, consider choosing the cold setting when starting a wash load. A full 90% of the energy used to wash a load goes into heating the water, according to Consumer Reports. So, you can save substantially on power usage when you use cold water.\nDon't worry about your clothes not getting clean in cold water, either. Most detergents are actually designed to work better in cold water. By choosing the cold setting you are actually getting cleaner clothes. An added benefit is cold water helps prevent color fading, as well.\nFor some loads, like towels and sheets, hot water is a better choice to kill bacteria. But everything else will be fine in cold water.\nSet your dryer to cooler heat\nA higher heat setting on your dryer uses more energy. Go with a lower heat setting (and a longer drying time) to use less energy.\nMake sure to use your dryer's cool-down option, too. It will finish up the load with the heat that is already in the dryer, instead of producing more.\nImprove your dryer's efficiency\nWe still hold that lowering the heat setting and slowing the drying time will save money, but the faster your clothes get dry, the less money you spend on electricity. Improving your dryer's efficiency can help make sure you don't have to run your still-damp clothes through the dryer a second time.\nFirst, make sure your dryer is cleaned out. The airways that carry humid hot air away from your clothes should be free of lint and debris. Clogged airways will keep the moist air trapped in the dryer drum with your clothes, making them take longer to dry. Every time you put in a load, make sure to clean out the lint trap thoroughly. Once a year, vacuum out the vents and the air hose coming out of the back of your dryer, too. Here are some tips on deep-cleaning your dryer.\nSecond, you can make the transportation of the humid air more efficient by shortening the accordion-like hose on the back of your dryer. A shorter hose can make your dryer work 20% faster because it doesn't need to push the moist air as far. If the hose doesn't have any excess length, move your dryer closer to the exit vent in the wall or floor, then trim the hose to a shorter length.\nThird, give your clothes an extra spin in the washer. Getting rid of excess water can speed up the drying process by as much as half.\nFinally, don't pack your dryer. Clothes need room to tumble around to get dry. A good rule of thumb is to only fill your dryer two-thirds of the way full.\nAlways run a full load of laundry\nWashers and dryers use about the same amount of electricity to wash a small load as they do a full load. So, it's more efficient to wait to do laundry until you have a full load, but remember -- don't over-stuff your dryer. Need to wash right away and don't have enough clothes and towels to fill up the basin? See this gallery for some household items you can clean in a washing machine that you may not have considered.\nConsider peak and off-peak hours\nIf your utility company charges extra for peak usage times, a simple change to your routine can help. Peak hours refer to certain times of the day where usage increases in your area. When that happens, a utility company with a time-of-use service will charge you extra to run your dishwasher or wash your clothes during peak hours. Using your non-essential appliances during off-peak hours instead can make a significant impact.\nContact your utility company to determine whether you're part of a time-of-use plan and when it charges extra for peak hours.

      "text": "Keeping up with the laundry is never easy. It's a chore that many of us avoid until we have to deal with it, but things get far more difficult if you open up your washing machine and are met with the odor of old books, rotting wood and damp socks. If this has never happened to you, you might be confused as to why your washing machine smells. We have bad news. It could be mold.\nMold and mildew feed off of heat and humidity, breeding in dark spaces that don't get properly aired out. During the peak of summer, mold can easily move into your washing machine and cause a problem you'll need to deal with.\nA quick look around Reddit threads suggests that more than a few people struggle with stubborn mold, mildew and bacteria in washing machine door seals. While some have experimented with using chemicals like bleach, odd smells and stubborn particles in and around the door of their washing machines can be a recurring problem.\nThankfully, tackling mold and mildew in your washing machine just requires some elbow grease. All it takes is a proper deep clean and your washer will be back to doing its job without mold, mildew or bacteria interfering.\nCleaning the washer, along with allowing it to air out between uses can work wonders. Not sure how to properly clean your washing machine? We'll walk you through what you need to know about killing bacteria or mold in your washer and how to rid your machine of those awful smells.\nRead more: Are You Washing Your Bath Towels Enough? Experts Doubt It\nThe best way to remove a bad smell from your washing machine\nIf you have mold in your washer, here's how to get rid of it. Doing this monthly will help prevent mold growth.\n1. Put on gloves and grab an old towel that you don't care about.\n2. Mix a solution of either bleach and hot water or vinegar and hot water. (Never mix bleach and vinegar -- it creates toxic chlorine gas.)\n3. Dip the towel in the mixture and start scrubbing away at any visible mold. Be sure to get the detergent dispenser and around the gaskets.\n4. Front-loading machines have a gasket around the door. If you have a front loader, clean and dry it thoroughly, including all the folds. Be careful not to tear the gasket.\n5. Run the wash cycle on the hottest setting your machine offers with a cup of bleach or vinegar. If using bleach, pour it into the compartment designated for bleach. If using vinegar, pour it into the detergent slot.\nIf your machine has a self-clean cycle, you can use that setting. This should kill any hidden mold that you may have missed.\n6. Use another old towel and wipe away all the moisture in your washing machine. This includes the drum, dispensers, seals and any other areas you can reach.\n7. Leave the washer door open to allow airflow to dry any parts you missed.\nSimple ways to prevent mold and mildew in your washer\nLeave the lid open if you're not washing clothes\nMold grows in dark, moist areas, which is what your washer becomes after you've unloaded the clothes. Whether it's a top or front loader, keeping the lid closed traps moisture, which can lead to built-up bacteria and a bad smell.\nLeaving the washing machine door open helps ventilate the area and prevents mold from growing in the first place.\nRemove wet clothes right away\nDamp clothes are another breeding ground for mold. If you're throwing in a load of laundry, make sure you'll be home to remove the clothes right when the wash cycle ends. Not only does this prevent mold from growing in your washer, but it keeps mildew out of your clean clothing, bedding and towels.\nDry damp seals and other parts after each use\nAfter you're finished using your washing machine for the day, wipe down any part of the washer that's damp. This includes the lid, drum, door, rubber gaskets and detergent dispenser (if your machine has that feature).\nKeep an old towel on hand for this purpose.\nDry the seals along with the rest of your washer to prevent moisture from sticking around. And while mold contamination can happen in any washer, it's especially common in high-efficiency (HE) front-loading washers. That's why you should regularly wash the gaskets and seals around the door and keep them dry. The gaskets make sure water doesn't leak out around the door and they also do a good job of sealing in the moisture that can help mold grow.\nYou should also remove pet hair, crumpled paper or any other debris from the machine right away.\nUse a high-efficiency washing machine\nLiquid detergents can leave a residue in your washing machine, giving mold a food source. So if you have a high-efficiency washer, the first thing to do to keep mold in check is to make sure you're using a laundry detergent made specifically for this type of washer, which will produce fewer suds. (Look for the letters HE on the bottle.)\nBetter yet, steer clear of liquid detergent altogether and switch to powder detergent or pods. Whichever you choose, make sure you're only using as much as you need to wash your clothes. If you use too much, your clothes may have a smell and residue.\nOnce you've cleaned your washer, it's time to move on to the rest of your house. Start with the bathroom: Here's a simple one-hour hack for degunking your showerhead and how to unclog a toilet without a plunger.\nFAQs\nWhat cleaning chemicals should I avoid mixing when cleaning my washing machine?\nYou're going to have to apply some elbow grease, put on some cleaning gloves and break out the cleaning chemicals to clean out your washer. A cleaning solution of hot water and bleach or hot water and vinegar is what you'll want to use to scrub out the inside of the machine, but you never want to combine bleach and vinegar -- that creates chlorine gas, which is toxic to you and anyone else in your home.\nWhat should I do after I finish running my washer?\nAfter you clean your washer and return to regular use, you'll still want to prevent new mold or mildew from developing within the machine. When you're done using your washing machine, make sure to dry the inside of the machine to avoid the warm, wet conditions that bacteria usually flourishes in."

      "text": "American families are facing a lot at the moment: expensive groceries, fluctuating gas prices, back-to-school shopping, and an ongoing uptick in utility bill costs due to increased air conditioning useage this summer. These things might leave you wondering how you can save some money around the house.\nLowering your energy and water bills is one option, and your laundry room is a good place to start. Washing machines and dryers can use a lot of water and electricity (or gas, if you have a gas dryer), particularly if you have an older model in your home. If you typically wash weekly loads of towels, bedding and clothes, you might notice your monthly bills are consistently expensive. But there are several things you can do to help save money in the laundry room -- no handwashing or line-drying of clothes required.\nHere are some simple changes you can make to lower your washer and dryer's energy consumption. For more ways to save around the house, start by unplugging your appliances and consider what temperature you should set your thermostat to this summer to save big.\nWash your clothes on cold\nUnless a clothing label specifies a certain temperature, consider choosing the cold setting when starting a wash load. A full 90% of the energy used to wash a load goes into heating the water, according to Consumer Reports. So, you can save substantially on power usage when you use cold water.\nDon't worry about your clothes not getting clean in cold water, either. Most detergents are actually designed to work better in cold water. By choosing the cold setting you are actually getting cleaner clothes. An added benefit is cold water helps prevent color fading, as well.\nFor some loads, like towels and sheets, hot water is a better choice to kill bacteria. But everything else will be fine in cold water.\nSet your dryer to cooler heat\nA higher heat setting on your dryer uses more energy. Go with a lower heat setting (and a longer drying time) to use less energy.\nMake sure to use your dryer's cool-down option, too. It will finish up the load with the heat that is already in the dryer, instead of producing more.\nImprove your dryer's efficiency\nWe still hold that lowering the heat setting and slowing the drying time will save money, but the faster your clothes get dry, the less money you spend on electricity. Improving your dryer's efficiency can help make sure you don't have to run your still-damp clothes through the dryer a second time.\nFirst, make sure your dryer is cleaned out. The airways that carry humid hot air away from your clothes should be free of lint and debris. Clogged airways will keep the moist air trapped in the dryer drum with your clothes, making them take longer to dry. Every time you put in a load, make sure to clean out the lint trap thoroughly.
