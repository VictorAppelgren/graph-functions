  "description": "Von der Leyen: EU Defense Plan to Benefit Poland Most",
  "content": "Let's start with this plan to increase defense spending. We know that NATO countries have committed to that 5% defense spending target. How is this likely to play out in Europe in the coming months? Yes. This announcement was made by Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, as part of a tour of seven European states that are closest to the frontline where that war is continuing in Ukraine. And so it was very much a show of solidarity by the EU to show these frontline countries that they're behind them and that they are continuing to commit to Ukraine security and support. So as we as you said there, Poland, she visited on Sunday, and Poland looks set to claim the lion's share of a new program announced by the European Commission earlier this year that seeks to raise its \u20ac150 billion worth of loans for defence in countries can apply for these loans at favorable rates and then use that money to enhance their own defense capabilities. And with the idea that European countries could corps coordinate more on the capabilities that they need. So this is very much as we start the season here in Brussels today, a sense of the of the importance of Ukraine and defense. Defence adds European Union officials get back to their desks here in Brussels.",
