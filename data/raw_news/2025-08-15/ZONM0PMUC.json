  "content": "President Trump\u2019s tariff onslaught this week left a lot of losers \u2014 from small, poor countries such as Laos and Algeria to wealthy U.S. trading partners such as Canada and Switzerland. They\u2019re now facing especially hefty export taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on the products they export to the U.S. starting Thursday.\n\nThe closest thing to winners may be the countries that succumbed to Trump\u2019s demands \u2014 and avoided even more pain. But it\u2019s unclear whether anyone will be able to claim victory in the long run \u2014 even the United States, the intended beneficiary of Trump\u2019s protectionist policies.\n\n\u201cIn many respects, everybody\u2019s a loser here,\u2019\u2019 said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at the New York Law School.\n\nBarely six months after he returned to the White House, Trump has demolished the old global economic order. Gone is one built on agreed-upon rules. In its place is a system in which Trump himself sets the rules, using America\u2019s enormous economic power to punish countries that won\u2019t agree to one-sided trade deals and extracting huge concessions from the ones that do.\n\n\u201cThe biggest winner is Trump,\u201d said Alan Wolff, a former U.S. trade official and deputy director-general at the World Trade Organization. \u201cHe bet that he could get other countries to the table on the basis of threats, and he succeeded \u2014 dramatically.\u2019\u2019\n\nEverything goes back to what Trump calls \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 \u2014 April 2 \u2014 when the president announced \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 taxes of up to 50% on imports from countries with which the United States ran trade deficits and 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else.\n\nHe invoked a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his sweeping import taxes. That allowed him to bypass Congress, which traditionally has had authority over taxes, including tariffs \u2014 all of which is now being challenged in court.\n\nTrump retreated temporarily after April announcement triggered a rout in financial markets and suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate.\n\nEventually some of them did, acceding to Trump\u2019s demands to pay what four months ago would have seemed unthinkably high tariffs to maintain their ability to sell to the vast American market.\n\nThe United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States \u2014 up from 1.3% before Trump amped up his trade war with the world. The U.S. demanded concessions even though it had run a trade surplus, not a deficit, with the U.K. for 19 straight years.\n\nThe European Union and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low-single-digit rates they paid last year, but lower than the tariffs he was threatening \u2014 30% on the EU and 25% on Japan.\n\nAlso cutting deals with Trump and agreeing to hefty tariffs were Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nEven countries that saw their tariffs lowered from April without reaching a deal are still paying much higher tariffs than before Trump took office. Angola\u2019s tariff, for instance, dropped to 15% from 32% in April, but in 2022 it was less than 1.5%.\n\nAnd while the Trump administration cut Taiwan\u2019s tariff to 20% from 32% in April, the pain will still be felt by a U.S. ally that China claims as its territory.\n\n\u201cTwenty percent from the beginning has not been our goal. We hope that in further negotiations we will get a more beneficial and more reasonable tax rate,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s President Lai Ching-te told reporters in Taipei on Friday.\n\nTrump also agreed to reduce the tariff on the tiny southern African kingdom of Lesotho to 15% from the 50% he\u2019d announced in April, but the damage may already have been done there.\n\nCountries that didn\u2019t knuckle under \u2014 and those that found other ways to incur Trump\u2019s wrath \u2014 got hit harder.\n\nEven some of the poor were not spared. Laos\u2019 annual economic output comes to $2,100 per person and Algeria\u2019s $5,600 \u2014 versus America\u2019s $75,000. Nonetheless, Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff and Algeria with a 30% levy.\n\nTrump slammed Brazil with a 50% import tax largely because he didn\u2019t like the way it was treating former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a close Trump ally who is facing trial for trying to overturn his electoral loss and inspiring a riot in the capital in 2023 \u2014 recalling Trump\u2019s role in the Jan. 6. insurrection two years earlier at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nNever mind that the U.S. has exported more to Brazil than it\u2019s imported every year since 2007.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to plaster a 35% tariff on long-standing U.S. ally Canada was partly designed to threaten Ottawa for saying it would recognize a Palestinian state in light of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Trump is a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSwitzerland was clobbered with a 39% import tax \u2014 even higher than the 31% Trump announced on April 2.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss probably wish that they had camped in Washington\u2019\u2019 to make a deal, said Wolff, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly not at all happy.\u2019\u2019\n\nFortunes may change if Trump\u2019s tariffs are upended in court. Five American businesses and 12 states are suing the president, arguing that his April 2 tariffs exceeded his authority under the 1977 law.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized court in New York, agreed and blocked the tariffs, although the government was allowed to continue collecting them while its appeal wends its way through the legal system, and may end up at the Supreme Court. In a hearing Thursday, the judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sounded skeptical about Trump\u2019s justifications for the tariffs.\n\n\u201cIf [the tariffs] get struck down, then maybe Brazil\u2019s a winner and not a loser,\u2019\u2019 Appleton said.\n\nTrump portrays his tariffs as a tax on foreign countries. But they are actually paid by import companies in the U.S. who typically pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. True, tariffs can hurt other countries by forcing their exporters to cut prices and sacrifice profits \u2014 or risk losing market share in the United States.\n\nBut economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that overseas exporters have absorbed just one-fifth of the rising costs from tariffs, while Americans and U.S. businesses have picked up the most of the tab.\n\nWalmart, Procter & Gamble, Ford, Best Buy, Adidas, Nike, Mattel and Stanley Black & Decker have all raised prices due to U.S. tariffs.\n\n\u201cThis is a consumption tax, so it disproportionately affects those who have lower incomes,\u201d Appleton said. \u201cSneakers, knapsacks ... your appliances are going to go up. Your TV and electronics are going to go up. Your video game devices, consoles are going to up because none of those are made in America.\u2019\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war has pushed the average U.S. tariff from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3% now, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University. And that will impose a $2,400 cost on the average household, the lab estimates.\n\nWiseman writes for the Associated Press. AP writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this report.",

Laos and Myanmar will face a 40% rate.\n- The move essentially returns U.S. tariff rates on those countries to those Trump first announced on April 2, so-called Liberation Day.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s decision to hike tariffs once again on some of America\u2019s largest trading partners rattled markets on Monday, dashing hopes on Wall Street that the White House would cut any significant trade deals, as it had promised, by the middle of this week.\nIn a series of letters sent to foreign leaders, and promptly posted by the president to his social media platform, Trump said the new rates amount to the cost of doing business with \u201cthe extraordinary Economy of the United States, The Number One Market in the World, by far.\u201d Under the new policy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Kazakhstan will face 25% import duties starting Aug. 1, while goods from Cambodia and Thailand are set for 36% tariffs. Laos and Myanmar will face a 40% rate, according to the letters.\nIndonesia faces a 32% duty. Bangladesh and Serbia were told their goods would face 35% import rates, while goods from South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina sent to the United States would face duties of 30%.\n\u201cIt is a Great Honor for me to send you this letter in that it demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship,\u201d Trump wrote in the letters, sending the same text to each foreign leader.\nMarkets recoiled at the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1.4%, the Nasdaq falling 1.2% and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 sinking 1.2%.\nThe move essentially returns U.S. tariff rates on those countries to those Trump first announced on April 2, on what he called Liberation Day, but that he ultimately abandoned over widespread Wall Street panic that began spooking the bond market.\nExecutives from Salesforce, Amazon, OpenAI and more have weighed in recently about how AI is affecting the job market.\nTrump hit pause on the crisis by announcing a 90-day suspension of the higher tariff rates, a period set to expire Wednesday. But the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Monday that Trump would extend the deadline to the end of the month.\nSeveral senior officials in the Trump administration had promised a slew of trade deals would follow the April episode \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re going to run 90 deals in 90 days,\u201d said Peter Navarro, the president\u2019s top trade advisor. Yet the administration has failed to secure a single detailed trade deal, instead announcing three frameworks of understanding with the United Kingdom, China and Vietnam.\n\u201cThe president is taking a very deliberate approach to correcting this wrong of many decades, of many past presidents \u2014 I think he should be commended for the time and the effort that he\u2019s putting into this,\u201d Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing.\n\u201cThe fact that he has announced a framework with China, a trade deal with the U.K., a trade deal with Vietnam and many others to come in just six months is truly historic, and it\u2019s a testament to this president and his trade team,\u201d she added.\nIn his letters to foreign leaders, Trump warned that any effort by their governments to retaliate would be met with escalation.\n\u201cIf for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 25% that we charge,\u201d he wrote.\nAgents on horseback and in armored vehicles participated in a daytime raid in the heart of Los Angeles\u2019 immigrant community.\nLeavitt said more letters would be sent in the coming days. She also stated that additional trade deals could be announced soon. \u201cWe are close,\u201d she said.\nIn a separate post on his Truth Social platform, Trump warned that countries in BRICS \u2014 an economic partnership comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran \u2014 would face an additional 10% tariff if they adopt \u201cAnti-American policies\u201d at a summit in Rio de Janeiro this week.\n\u201cThere will be no exceptions to this policy,\u201d the president wrote.\nScott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, told CNBC in an interview that his inbox was \u201cfull last night with a lot of new offers\u201d for trade deals ahead of the now-defunct Wednesday deadline.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people change their tune in terms of negotiations,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be a busy couple of days.\u201d\nThe stock market reaction to Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs, which hiked rates on countries all around the world, was an historic rout, eviscerating trillions of dollars in value, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s index bleeding 12% in just four days.\nMarkets recovered within weeks, after Trump reversed course, with the S&P hitting a record high on Thursday."

      "text": "Trump injects a new dose of uncertainty in tariffs as he pushes start date to Aug. 7\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For weeks, President Trump was promising the world economy would change on Friday with his new tariffs in place. It was an ironclad deadline, administration officials assured the public.\nBut when Trump signed the order Thursday night imposing new tariffs, the start date of the punishing import taxes was pushed back seven days so the tariff schedule could be updated. The change in tariffs on 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands was potentially welcome news to countries that had not yet reached a deal with the U.S. It also injected a new dose of uncertainty for consumers and businesses still wondering what\u2019s going to happen and when.\nTrump told NBC News in a Thursday night interview the tariffs process was going \u201cvery well, very smooth.\u201d But even as the Republican president insisted these new rates would stay in place, he added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that somebody doesn\u2019t come along in four weeks and say we can make some kind of a deal.\u201d\nTrump has promised that his tax increases on the nearly $3 trillion in goods imported to the United States will usher in newfound wealth, launch a cavalcade of new factory jobs, reduce the budget deficits and, simply, get other countries to treat America with more respect.\nThe vast tariffs risk jeopardizing America\u2019s global standing as allies feel forced into unfriendly deals. As taxes on the raw materials used by U.S. factories and basic goods, the tariffs also threaten to create new inflationary pressures and hamper economic growth \u2014 concerns the Trump White House has dismissed.\nQuestions swirl around the tariffs despite Trump\u2019s eagerness\nAs the clock ticked toward Trump\u2019s self-imposed deadline, few things seemed to be settled other than the president\u2019s determination to levy the taxes he has talked about for decades. The very legality of the tariffs remains an open question as a U.S. appeals court on Thursday heard arguments on whether Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an \u201cemergency\u201d under a 1977 law to charge the tariffs, allowing him to avoid congressional approval.\nTrump was ebullient as much of the world awaited what he would do.\n\u201cTariffs are making America GREAT & RICH Again,\u201d he said Thursday morning on Truth Social.\nOthers saw a policy carelessly constructed by the U.S. president, one that could impose harms gradually over time that would erode America\u2019s power and prosperity.\n\u201cThe only things we\u2019ll know for sure on Friday morning are that growth-sapping U.S. import taxes will be historically high and complex, and that, because these deals are so vague and unfinished, policy uncertainty will remain very elevated,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of economics at the Cato Institute. \u201cThe rest is very much TBD.\u201d\nThe new tariffs build off ones announced in the spring\nTrump initially imposed the Friday deadline after his previous \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April resulted in a stock market panic. His unusually high tariff rates announced then led to recession fears, prompting Trump to impose a 90-day negotiating period. When he was unable to create enough trade deals with other countries, he extended the timeline and sent out letters to world leaders that simply listed rates, prompting a slew of hasty agreements.\nSwiss imports will now be taxed at a higher rate, 39%, than the 31% Trump threatened in April, while Liechtenstein saw its rate slashed from 37% to 15%. Countries not listed in the Thursday night order would be charged a baseline 10% tariff.\nTrump negotiated trade frameworks over the past few weeks with the EU, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 allowing the president to claim victories as other nations sought to limit his threat of charging even higher tariff rates. He said Thursday there were agreements with other countries, but he declined to name them.\nAsked on Friday if countries were happy with the rates set by Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said: \u201cA lot of them are.\u201d\nThursday began with a palpable sense of tension\nThe EU was awaiting a written agreement on its 15% tariff deal. Switzerland and Norway were among the dozens of countries that did not know what their tariff rate would be, while Trump agreed after a Thursday morning phone call to keep Mexico\u2019s tariffs at 25% for a 90-day negotiating period. The president separately on Thursday amended an order to raise certain tariffs on Canada to 35%.\nEuropean leaders face blowback for seeming to cave to Trump, even as they insist that this is merely the start of talks and stress the importance of maintaining America\u2019s support of Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has already indicated that his country can no longer rely on the U.S. as an ally, and Trump declined to talk to him on Thursday.\nIndia, with its 25% tariff announced Wednesday by Trump, may no longer benefit as much from efforts to pivot manufacturing out of China. While the Trump administration has sought to challenge China\u2019s manufacturing dominance, it is separately in extended trade talks with that country, which faces a 30% tariff and is charging a 10% retaliatory rate on the U.S.\nMajor companies came into the week warning that tariffs would begin to squeeze them financially. Ford Motor Co. said it anticipated a net $2 billion hit to earnings this year from tariffs. French skincare company Yon-Ka is warning of job freezes, scaled-back investment and rising prices.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s new tariffs will survive a legal challenge\nFederal judges sounded skeptical Thursday about Trump\u2019s use of a 1977 law to declare the long-standing U.S. trade deficit a national emergency that justifies tariffs on almost every country.\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking for an unbounded authority,\u201d Judge Todd Hughes of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit told a Justice Department lawyer representing the administration.\nThe judges didn\u2019t immediately rule, and the case is expected to reach the Supreme Court eventually.\nThe Trump White House has pointed to the increase in federal revenues as a sign that the tariffs will reduce the budget deficit, with $127 billion in customs and duties collected so far this year \u2014 about $70 billion more than last year.\nNew tariffs threaten to raise inflation rates\nThere are not yet signs that tariffs will lead to more domestic manufacturing jobs, and Friday\u2019s employment report showed the U.S. economy now has 37,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than it did in April.\nOn Thursday, one crucial measure of inflation, known as the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that prices have climbed 2.6% over the 12 months that ended in June, a sign that inflation may be accelerating as the tariffs flow through the economy.\nThe prospect of higher inflation from the tariffs has caused the Federal Reserve to hold off on additional cuts to its benchmark rates, a point of frustration for Trump, who on Truth Social, called Fed Chair Jerome Powell a \u201cTOTAL LOSER.\u201d\nBut before Trump\u2019s tariffs, Powell seemed to suggest that the tariffs had put the U.S. economy and much of the world into a state of unknowns.\n\u201cThere are many uncertainties left to resolve,\u201d Powell told reporters Wednesday. \u201cSo, yes, we are learning more and more. It doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re very close to the end of that process. And that\u2019s not for us to judge, but it does \u2014 it feels like there\u2019s much more to come.\u201d\nBoak writes for the Associated Press. AP writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report."

Trump has also announced the framework for a deal with China, the details of which remain fuzzy.\nTrump has now extended the deadline for negotiations to Aug. 1 and tinkered with his threatened tariffs, leaving the global trading system pretty much where it stood three months ago \u2014 in a state of limbo as businesses delay decisions on investments, contracts and hiring because they don\u2019t know what the rules will be.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rerun, basically,\u2019\u2019 said William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official who\u2019s now an advisor with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Trump and his team \u201cdon\u2019t have the deals they want. So they\u2019re piling on the threats.\u201d\nThe pattern has repeated itself enough times to earn Trump the label TACO \u2014 an acronym coined by the Financial Times\u2019 Robert Armstrong that stands for \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out.\u201d\n\u201cThis is classic Trump: Threaten, threaten more, but then extend the deadline,\u201d Reinsch said. \u201cJuly 30 arrives, does he do it again if he still doesn\u2019t have the deals?\u2019\u2019 (Trump said Tuesday that there will be no more extensions.)\nThe deal drought represents a collision with reality.\nNegotiating simultaneously with every country on earth was always an impossible task, as Trump himself belatedly admitted last month in an interview with Fox News. (\u201cThere\u2019s 200 countries,\u2019\u2019 the president said. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to all of them.\u2019\u2019) And many trading partners \u2014 such as Japan and the European Union \u2014 were always likely to balk at Trump\u2019s demands, at least without getting something in return.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to negotiate trade agreements,\u201d which usually takes several months even when it involves just one country or a small regional group, said Chad Bown, an economic advisor in the Obama White House and now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cWhat the administration is doing is negotiating a bunch of these at the same time.\u2019\u2019\nThe drama began April 2 \u2014 \u201cLiberation Day,\u2019\u2019 Trump called it \u2014 when the tariff-loving president announced a so-called baseline 10% import tax on everybody and what he called \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 levies of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits.\nThe 10% baseline tariffs appear to be here to stay. Trump needs them to raise money to patch the hole his massive tax-cut bill is blasting into the federal budget deficit.\nBy themselves, the baseline tariffs represent a massive shift in American trade policy: Tariffs averaged around 2.5% when Trump returned to the White House and were even lower before he started raising them in his first term.\nBut the reciprocal tariffs are an even bigger deal.\nIn announcing them, Trump effectively blew up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the United States and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay round. Countries could set their own tariffs \u2014 but under the \u201cmost favored nation\u2019\u2019 approach, they couldn\u2019t charge one country more than they charged another.\nNow Trump is setting the tariff rates himself, creating \u201ctailor-made trade plans for each and every country on this planet,\u2019\u2019 in the words of White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nBut investors have recoiled at the audacious plan, fearing that it will disrupt trade and damage the world economy. Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs, for instance, set off a four-day rout in global financial markets. Trump blinked. Less than 13 hours after the reciprocal tariffs took effect April 9, he abruptly suspended them for 90 days, giving countries time to negotiate with his trade team.\nDespite the Trump administration\u2019s expressions of confidence, the talks turned into a slog.\n\u201cCountries have their own politics, their own domestic politics,\u201d Reinsch said. \u201cTrump structured this ideally so that all the concessions are made by the other guys and the only U.S. concession is: We don\u2019t impose the tariffs.\u2019\u2019\nBut countries like South Korea and Japan needed \u201cto come back with something,\u2019\u2019 he said. Their thinking: \u201cWe have to get some concessions out of the United States to make it look like this is a win-win agreement and not a we-fold-and-surrender agreement. \u201d\nJapan, for example, wanted relief from another Trump tariff \u2014 50% levies on steel and aluminum.\nCountries may also be hesitant to reach a deal with the United States while the Trump administration conducts investigations that might result in new tariffs on a range of products, including pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\nFrustrated by the lack of progress, Trump on Monday sent letters to Japan, South Korea and 12 other countries, saying he\u2019d hit them with tariffs Aug. 1 if they couldn\u2019t reach an agreement. The levies were close to what he\u2019d announced on April 2; Japan\u2019s, for example, would be 25%, compared to the 24% unveiled April 2.\nTrump did sign an agreement last month with the United Kingdom that, among other provisions, reduced U.S. tariffs on British automotive and aerospace products while opening the U.K. market for American beef and ethanol. But the pact kept the baseline tariff on British products mostly in place, underlining Trump\u2019s commitment to the 10% tax despite the United States running a trade surplus \u2014 not a deficit \u2014 with the U.K. for 19 straight years, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.\nOn July 2, Trump announced a deal with Vietnam. The Vietnamese agreed to let U.S. products into the country duty-free while accepting a 20% tax on their exports to the United States, Trump said, though details of the agreement have not been released.\nThe lopsided deal with Vietnam suggests that Trump can successfully use the tariff threat to bully concessions out of smaller economies.\n\u201cThey just can\u2019t really negotiate in the same way that the [European Union] or Korea or Japan [or] Canada can negotiate with the United States,\u2019\u2019 said Dan McCarthy, principal at McCarthy Consulting and a former official with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cA lot of [smaller] countries just want to get out of this and are willing to cut their losses.\u2019\u2019\nBut wrangling a deal with bigger trading partners is likely to remain tougher.\n\u201cThe U.S. is gambling that these countries will ultimately be intimidated and fold,\u201d Reinsch said. \u201cAnd the countries are gambling that the longer this stretches out, and the longer it goes without Trump producing any more deals, the more desperate he gets, and he lowers his standards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a giant game of chicken.\u2019\u2019\nWiseman writes for the Associated Press."

While some partners\u2014such as the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam\u2014agreed to reduced rates, many smaller or poorer nations faced 30\u201140% tariffs, and even Canada and Switzerland were hit hard. The U.S. court has blocked the tariffs, and the administration\u2019s attempts to secure 90 deals in 90 days have largely failed, leaving trade policy in limbo. Economists warn that the tariffs mainly raise U.S. consumer prices, with limited benefit to domestic manufacturing or the federal deficit.",
