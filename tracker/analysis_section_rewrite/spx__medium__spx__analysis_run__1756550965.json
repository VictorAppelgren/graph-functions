      "feedback": "The draft is focused on CRWD and the 3‑6‑month horizon, but a few statements lack a direct citation to the source (ID KNWKYIQ1W) or rely on unsupported speculation.  \n• The sentence *“The timing window for product impact is the next 90–120 days, as early adopters in the hybrid‑workforce segment are expected to sign up, driving incremental ARR and potentially improving operating leverage”* is not backed by the article; either add a citation that explicitly links the 90‑120 day expectation to the launch of Falcon Next‑Gen Identity Security (e.g., “(KNWKYIQ1W)”) or remove the time‑frame claim.  \n• The paragraph *“The primary drivers of this scenario are revenue growth, margin improvement, AI‑driven efficiency gains, and cloud partnership expansion, all of which are interlinked through the company’s SaaS model and the broader cybersecurity spend cycle”* should include a citation after each driver to show they come from the article (e.g., “…margin improvement (KNWKYIQ1W), AI‑driven efficiency gains (KNWKYIQ1W), …”).  \n• The speculative transition “*the company can transition from a high‑growth, high‑margin expansion phase to a more mature, stable earnings regime*” should be tempered or cited; add a note that this is a forward‑looking view based on the projected 8 % margin by 2028 (KNWKYIQ1W).  \n• Risk and watch‑list statements (“execution failure of Falcon, intensified competition, macro slowdown; Q3 earnings metrics, margin figures, renewal rates, competitor launches”) should each be followed by a citation to the article’s risk section (KNWKYIQ1W).  \n\nAfter adding these inline citations or trimming unsupported speculation, the analysis will meet the “truth > verbosity” and “explicit causal mapping” standards.",
