      "summary": "Wise is exploring a UK banking licence to convert its ring‑fenced electronic money holdings into deposits and enable direct access to the UK payment infrastructure, potentially reducing reliance on third‑party banks and cutting costs. The company has engaged with banking executives over the past two months but has not yet applied for a licence. Wise also plans a dual listing move to a US exchange while maintaining a London secondary listing, aiming to tap deeper capital markets and expand its US presence.",
