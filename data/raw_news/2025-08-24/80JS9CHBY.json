  "title": "JD Vance Mocked for Embarrassing WWII History Mistake",
  "description": "The vice president claimed \u201cevery major human conflict in history\u201d has been ended through negotiation.",
  "content": "Former military journalist JD Vance got his history mixed up while trying to explain President Trump\u2019s newest approach to ending the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to Kristen Welker on Meet the Press Sunday, the vice president vigorously defended Trump\u2019s push to end the war through give-and-take negotiations\u2014rather than the sanctions and ceasefire demands he once leveled at Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re engaging in this diplomatic process in good faith. We\u2019re trying to negotiate as much as we can with both the Russians and the Ukrainians to find a middle ground to stop the killing,\u201d he told the NBC News host, adding that the conflict was \u201cnot in anyone\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nWelker later brought up the concern that Ukraine was expected to accept the loss of territory illegally seized by the Russians in order to end the war, which President Volodymyr Zelensky has made clear he has no interest in doing.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the Ukrainians are going to ultimately make the determination about where you draw the territorial lines in their own country,\u201d Vance responded.\n\nAfter sidestepping the implications of Ukraine having to make territorial concessions, Vance then suggested that finding \u201cmiddle ground\u201d was \u201chow wars ultimately get settled.\u201d\n\nHe outlined, \u201cIf you go back to World War Two, if you go back to World War One. If you go back to every major conflict in human history, they all end with some kind of negotiation.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Vance, the Second World War was not negotiated to an end, but came to a close with the unconditional surrender of Germany on May 7, 1945, and Japan on September 2, 1945.\n\n\u201cVance says WWII ended in negotiation -someone tell that to Hiroshima,\u201d one user wrote on X.\n\nVance during the interview also described the US\u2019 new role as being \u201cnot active parties in the negotiation, we\u2019re effectively mediating.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf Ukrainians are willing to say something on territory that brings the conflict to a close, we\u2019re not going to stop them. We\u2019re also not going to force them, because it\u2019s not our country.\u201d\n\nSetting history aside, the emphasis on mediation\u2014and the hint that Ukraine may need to cut its losses to end the conflict\u2014marks a striking about-face from Trump\u2019s harder line just days earlier.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s top negotiator in Ukraine appeared like a deer in headlights discussing what the president had achieved in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.\nSpecial Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff insisted his boss made \u201cprogress\u201d achieving peace during the summit, though acknowledged that what Trump fell short of the ceasefire that he had promised before the meeting.\n\u201cMaybe not enough for a peace deal, but we\u2019re on the path for the first time,\u201d Witkoff said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union Sunday.\nWitkoff said Russia has agreed to \u201clegislative enshrinement in the Russian Federation\u201d not to go after European countries and violate their sovereignty before claiming cryptically that the failure to arrive at a ceasefire at the Alaska summit had paved the way for an end to fighting.\n\u201cWe are intent on trying to hammer out a peace deal that ends the fighting permanently, quicker than a ceasefire,\u201d Witkoff claimed.\nHost Jake Tapper appeared perplexed.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how not getting the ceasefire is a win,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe cut through all kinds of issues that would have to be discussed and agreed to during a ceasefire period,\u201d Witkoff claimed. \u201cThe fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously, ultimately in control of the Ukrainians\u2014that could not have been discussed at this meeting.\u201d\nWithout specifying, Witkoff said that the Russian delegation \u201cmade some other concessions on several of the regions [of Ukraine],\u201d which he called \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s enough,\u201d he said.\nWitkoff said territorial concessions would be discussed on Monday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nWitkoff further claimed Putin had agreed to \u201ceffectively offer Article Five-like language to cover a security guarantee,\u201d referring to the provision of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) agreement that signatories would treat an attack on any NATO member as an attack on them all.\nTapper pressed Witkoff on this claim, asking Witkoff if \u201cany further incursions in Ukraine, Russia would understand would be seen as an attack on all NATO members?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Jake, that\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cWe got to an agreement that the United States and other European nations could effectively offer Article 5-like language to cover a security guarantee.\u201d\nWitkoff\u2019s remarks come after an abysmal meeting with Putin on Wednesday in which he mistook Putin\u2019s demand for a \u201cpeaceful withdrawal\u201d of Ukrainian forces from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as a proposed concession from Putin to pull back Russian troops in the regions.\nWitkoff\u2019s lukewarm evaluation on CNN comes after Trump rated his meeting with Putin as a \u201c10 out of 10.\u201d\nAfter the meeting, Trump walked back his goal of achieving a ceasefire\u2014which he said Putin would have to agree to on Friday or face economic consequences\u2014and has pivoted to trying to achieve a peace deal involving territorial concessions to Russia.\nAccording to one European diplomat who spoke to Fox News on Saturday, Trump supports the idea of Russia taking full control of the eastern Donbas region. The Donbas region includes Luhansk, which Russia controls, and Donetsk, which is still heavily contested and controlled partly by Ukrainian forces.\nLast week, Zelensky said that he would reject any proposal to cede the region to Russia, saying that would \u201copen a bridgehead\u201d to further territorial incursions from Putin.\nUltimately, Witkoff said that \u201ceverything is going to be about what the Ukrainians can live with,\u201d continuing to put the onus on Zelensky to accept major concessions to end the war.\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment."

      "text": "President Donald Trump was captured on camera noticeably hiding his right hand heavily caked in makeup as he spoke to journalists from the Oval Office at the end of the week.\nTrump, 79, had a full presidential plate on Friday: He visited National Guard troops, deployed in his military takeover of Washington D.C., stopped by the Kennedy Center and toured the immersive The People\u2018s House museum\u2014all while wearing a tacky statement hat.\nYet it was during Trump\u2019s museum stop when photographers noticed the president\u2019s hand conspicuously smeared with makeup. In several photos taken during the stop, the president\u2019s right hand can be seen with a slash of concealer several shades lighter than the surrounding red, blotchy skin.\nTrump appeared to take notice of the makeup fail when he returned to the Oval Office as he opted instead to cover his right hand as much as he could with his left hand. Speaking to the press about the cosmetic changes he has made to the Oval Office, the attempted coverup made for some awkward hand gymnastics on camera.\n\u201cYou see the way this is looking,\u201d Trump said, pointing to gilded trim around the Oval Office while noticeably turning his right hand so cameras could only see his palm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like gold, and there is nothing like solid gold, but this beautiful office needed it,\u201d he added, before covering his right hand again with his left.\nA closeup photograph taken of his right hand during the moment revealed that it still appeared to be stained with concealer.\nThe White House revealed last month that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after photos of his bruised right hand and cankles sparked health concerns at the 2025 FIFA World Cup on July 13.\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, CVI causes mild symptoms such as swelling but rarely will \u201clead to serious complications.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s own doctor previously said it was one explanation for his bruising.\n\u201cRecent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand,\u201d the president\u2019s physician,Sean Barbabella, wrote in a July memo, which Karoline Leavitt read aloud to the press pool. \u201cThis is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.\u201d\nThe White House again on Friday attributed his bruising to his active schedule greeting Americans.\n\u201cPresident Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement Friday.\n\u201cHis commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,\u201d she added.\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for clarification on whether bruising on the president\u2019s hand is related to treatment for chronic venous insufficiency."

  "argos_summary": "Former military journalist JD Vance misrepresented history while defending President Trump\u2019s new strategy to end the Ukraine war, arguing that wars are settled through negotiation and that Ukraine should accept territorial concessions. He cited WWII as an example of negotiated peace, a claim that critics pointed out was inaccurate, and suggested the U.S. should act as a mediator rather than an active party. The piece also covers Trump\u2019s recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff claimed progress toward a peace deal despite no ceasefire, and notes that Ukraine\u2019s president Zelensky has rejected any ceding of territory. Additionally, the article reports on a separate incident in which Trump\u2019s right hand was seen covered in makeup, prompting speculation about a chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis. Overall, the article highlights a shift in Trump\u2019s foreign policy rhetoric and the controversies surrounding his statements.",
