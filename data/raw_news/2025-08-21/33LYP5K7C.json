  "title": "Neurogen Biomarking: The Company That\u2019s Changing the Future of Brain Health",
  "description": "Headquartered in Chicago, the company\u2019s mission is clear: to make early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurodegenerative diseases not only possible, but routine.",
  "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease is not just a medical crisis. It is a human one. It affects nearly 7 million Americans today, yet the overwhelming majority are diagnosed only after the disease has taken hold. Behind the statistics are families left scrambling, lives rerouted, and systems overwhelmed. For Dr. Rany Aburashed, a practicing neurologist and researcher, this failure to act early was no longer acceptable.\n\nIn 2024, he founded Neurogen Biomarking to change that reality permanently. Headquartered in Chicago, the company\u2019s mission is clear: to make early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurodegenerative diseases not only possible, but routine. Their belief is simple. Brain health should be proactive, not reactive. And timing is everything.\n\nRebuilding Brain Health from the Ground Up\n\nNeurogen\u2019s approach represents a full rethinking of how cognitive decline is detected, understood, and acted upon. Rather than waiting for symptoms to appear and escalate, the company has developed an at-home ecosystem built for speed, scale, and science.\n\nA small blood sample is used to measure pTau217, a biomarker shown to correlate with early Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. This is paired with digital cognitive assessments and a telehealth consultation with a board-certified neurologist. The process delivers insight without the need for hospital visits or long wait times.\n\nMore importantly, it empowers families at the very moment they need clarity most.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of delivering test results,\u201d says Dr. Aburashed. \u201cWe\u2019re in the business of delivering time. Time to plan, time to act, time to preserve quality of life.\u201d\n\nNeurogen is not merely entering the diagnostics field; it is working to establish a new approach to care where early insights could become a key component of clinical practice. The company\u2019s operational model reflects that ambition. Its leadership team includes startup and scientific veterans like Dr. Ken Bahk and Dr. Elisabeth Thijssen.\n\nAlready, the company has surpassed 500 completed tests through its beta program, claiming a 98 percent satisfaction rate and more than 1,000 individuals on the waitlist prior to launch.\n\nThe most urgent insight behind Neurogen\u2019s mission is this: 92 percent of Alzheimer\u2019s patients are diagnosed too late to benefit from disease-modifying therapies or meaningful intervention. Neurogen exists for that 92 percent.\n\nWith every test, interpretation, and family reached, Neurogen is contributing to the evolving standard of care. One where cognitive screening is as normalized as a cholesterol check. One where early detection becomes a right, not a privilege.\n\nNeurogen Biomarking is not only addressing a medical gap but also laying the groundwork for a future in brain health, focused on access, timing, and practical solutions.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not substitute for professional medical advice.

      "text": "\u201cWhen I first found out I had a medical condition I probably went through 4 residents and never really got the chance to establish a relationship with any doctor to help take care of my condition. It became frustrating to constantly have to explain myself over and over about the condition and how I felt daily to several different people. At one point I was just over seeing so many different people so I researched a neurologist and decided to go with Rany. Finding him was one of the best decisions I had made. He is a awesome doctor to work with and he truly cares about his patients. I feel that he is extremely knowledgeable in his work and does a great job of explaining the type of care you need. I felt great when I walked out that office. I have yet to find a doctor such as him in my new state, but he is great at what he does. \u201d\nActivity\n-\nGrateful for the opportunity to present our work at #AAIC comparing fully automated platforms for plasma p-tau217\u2014an exciting step toward making\u2026\nGrateful for the opportunity to present our work at #AAIC comparing fully automated platforms for plasma p-tau217\u2014an exciting step toward making\u2026\nLiked by Rany Aburashed DO\n-\nThank you for the thoughtful coverage highlighting the Neurogen ecosystem.
