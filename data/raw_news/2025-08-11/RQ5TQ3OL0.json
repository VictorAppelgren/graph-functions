  "description": "Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow discuss ongoing trade talks between the US and China taking place in Stockholm and how those could affect AI and the sale of rare earths. Plus, for the first time ever, Apple is shuttering a retail store in China. And Microsoft and OpenAI are in advanced talks to change the partnership that helped kick off the AI boom. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "> > BLOOMBERG TECH IS LIVE FROM COAST-TO-COAST WITH CAROLINE HYDE IN NEW YORK AND ED LUDLOW IN SAN FRANCISCO. ED: THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. APPLE CLOSES A RETAIL STORE IN CHINA FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE IPHONE MAKER'S TO REVIVE SALES. CAROLINE: U.S. AND CHINESE OFFICIALS CONTINUE TALKS TO EXTEND A TARIFF TRUCE WITH TECH EXPORT CONTROLS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE. ED: WE DISCUSSED SO IF I'S SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS AS THE STOCK SURGES. CAROLINE: IT IS ALONE IN TERMS OF SEARCHING RIGHT NOW. IT FEELS AS IF THE GENERAL MARKETS ARE TREADING WATER AHEAD OF THE FED DECISIONS TOMORROW, A SPATE OF EARNINGS AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION COME WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY AND LOOKING AT THE NASDAQ 100 CLINGING TO GAINS. WE HAVE BIG MOVERS TO THE UPSIDE AND THE DOWNSIDE, GETTING TO SOME OF THE MICRO DATA. ED: EARNINGS IS REALLY A FEATURE. A SURPRISE SWING TO A LOSS. AND THE TRAJECTORY OF THE STOCK. PAYPAL HAS MADE A LATE MOVE IN THE SESSION. ONE OF THE FACTORS IS THE CEO TALKING ABOUT WORRYING CONSUMER DATA. APPLE IS KIND OF SOFTER. A BIG POINTS DRAG FOR THE INDEX LEVEL. CLOSING HIS STORE IN CHINA AND HEADLINES IN THE LAST HOUR FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT JP MORGAN IS NOW THE FRONT RUNNER TO TAKE OVER THAT APPLE CREDIT CARD BUSINESS. THERE WAS A LOT TO DISCUSS. CAROLINE: AND THERE IS A PERSON TO DO IT WITH. TOM GILES JOINS US NOW. THIS SIGNAL WE ARE GETTING, PULLING BACK FROM ONE PARTICULAR AREA, BRICKS AND MORTAR IN CHINA, IS IT A BIG DEAL FOR APPLE? TOM: CHINA IS A HUGE DEAL FOR APPLE. LET'S PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE. THIS ONE PARTICULAR STORE. AM I LOOKING HERE? THIS ONE PARTICULAR STORE COACHING HUGO BOSS HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THERE. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH TO READ INTO THIS ONE PARTICULAR MALL. CHINA IS A HUGE MARKET FOR APPLE AND THEY HAVE SEEN SALES DECLINING FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY IN CHINA. THERE ARE DEFLATIONARY QUESTIONS. EXPORTS ARE HUGE PART OF CHINA'S GLOBAL ECONOMY. DEMAND, HOW BIG IS DEMAND. WE WILL BE HEARING FROM APPLE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN CHINA AND DON'T FORGET, THERE WAS A LOT OF COMPETITION DOMESTICALLY IN CHINA FROM NAMES LIKE HUAWEI AND OTHERS. BUT THE COMPETITION IS REAL AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES TO APPLE BECAUSE OF ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS AND WHETHER AND HOW MUCH PRESSURE THE GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING ON DOMESTIC MARKETS TO FOCUS ON CHINA NAMES AND NOT APPLE. ED: THAT SETS US UP FOR EARNINGS WHERE ANALYSTS THINK THEY WILL SWING BACK TO REVENUE GROWTH ON A YEAR ON YEAR BASIS. THE HEADLINE IS FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND THAT JP MORGAN AND A PACK OF MANY AS THE FRONT RUNNER TO TAKE OVER THE CREDIT CARD BUSINESS. INTERESTING IN THE SENSE THAT SERVICES FOR APPLE IS IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW? TOM: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP FOR THE BANKS. GOLDMAN TRIED IT WITH APPLE. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR CONSUMER STRATEGY AND WHETHER THAT WAS THE RIGHT MIX FOR THEM. IT IS A BIG DEAL FOR JP MORGAN. OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH FINANCIAL SERVICES PRODUCTS TO A WHOLE NEW LEGIONS OF APPLE CUSTOMERS. BIG DEAL FOR THEM. ED: BLOOMBERG'S SENIOR EXECUTIVE EDITOR FOR TECH TOM GILES IN SAN FRANCISCO. U.S. AND CHINESE OFFICIALS ARE IN THEIR SECOND DAY OF TRADE TALKS IN STOCKHOLM TO EXTEND THE TARIFF TRUCE BEYOND THE 90 DAY PERIOD. LET'S GET OVER TO STOCKHOLM WHERE OLIVER IS STANDING BY. WHAT IS THE LATEST? OLIVER: THAT'S RIGHT. WE ARE IN THE BRIEFING ROOM EXPECTING TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT AT ANY MOMENT NOW. THEY HAVE BEEN LOCKED INTO DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR CHINESE COUNTERPARTS. FIVE HOURS YESTERDAY, SIX HOURS SO FAR TODAY IN TERMS OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AND THE AMBITION IS TO EXTEND THE TRADE TRUCE THAT STANDS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. THOSE TARIFFS HAVE DROPPED DOWN TO 30%. 10% ARE BASELINE TARIFFS. THAT WAS DOWN AT THE FEVER PITCH OF THE TRADE WAR. THAT IS SET TO EXPIRE AUGUST 12 AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE LOCKED IN THE DISCUSSIONS TO EXTEND OVER ANOTHER 90 DAYS. THERE ARE A PANOPLY OF OTHER ISSUES TO DISCUSS. IS THERE ENOUGH PROGRESS TO GET A KIND OF TIMELINE ON WHEN A FURTHER DISCUSSION WILL TAKE PLACE? PROBABLY A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUES OF TRADE. THE DEAL WITH THE EU. PHARMACEUTICAL TARIFFS. A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS TO PUT TO THE SECRETARY. CAROLINE: GOING BACK TO OUR SWEET SPOT OF STEP -- TECH, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MADE ABOUT RARE EARTH METALS AND WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET MORE SWIFTLY INTO THE UNITED STATES AND THERE WAS THE OLIVE BRANCH WITH NVIDIA. SEC. BESSENT: THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT IS KIND OF THE ONLY PLACE YOU HAVE SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF OLIVE BRANCHES EXTENDED FROM THE U.S. AND TO ONE ANOTHER. EACH SIDE IS DEPENDENT ON THE OTHER. CHINA HAS THE STRUGGLE HOLD ON RARE EARTH METALS AND THE U.S. HAS A STRANGLEHOLD ON ADVANCED CHIPS. THERE WILL BE A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THOSE METALS HAVE BEEN FLOWING AND I'M SURE THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS TO TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT. STAY TUNED AND WE WILL HEAR FROM THE TREASURY SECRETARY QUITE SOON. CAROLINE: LET'S GET YOU BROADER CONTEXT NOW. THE CEO OF THE KROC INSTITUTE FOR TECH DIPLOMACY, A SICK RENT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR GLOBAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS DURING THE FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. MICHELLE, THE CONTEXT NOW IS ONE OF WHICH THE U.S. AND CHINA ARE SETTING THEMSELVES UP FOR THIS RACE AND AI OR MANUFACTURING OR ENERGY, WHICH ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF WHERE WE TAKE TRADE GOING FORWARD? > > THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE AMERICAN SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND LEADERSHIP AND THAT IS WHAT TRADE NEGOTIATIONS ARE ABOUT. CHINA HAS BUILT A MASSIVE MANUFACTURING ECONOMY. THE UNITED STATES HAS BUILT A MASSIVE CONSUMER ECONOMY. BEING A CONSUMER AT THAT SCALE IS A BIG VULNERABILITY WHEN YOUR LARGEST SUPPLIER IS AN ADVERSARY AND WE BUY AND CONSUME $300 BILLION MORE STUFF FROM CHINA THAN THEY BUY FROM US. THAT MATTERS WHEN IT IS NOT JUST TOYS AT WALMART AND HOME APPLIANCES. WE ARE CONSUMING THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. YOU MENTIONED RARE EARTH MAGNETS, BATTERIES, PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS, MAKING CHIPS ACROSS THE WORLD. REBALANCING OUR TRADE RELATIONSHIP IS KEY TO MAKING SURE WE ARE RE-INCENTIVIZING OUR ABILITY AND MAKING SURE WE ARE RELYING NOT RELYING ON CHINA -- MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT RELYING ON CHINA TO DO THOSE THINGS. CAROLINE: ONLY ONE OF THE RARE EARTH METALS IN -- SUPPLIERS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE GOING TO BE SUPPLYING APPLE. ARE THERE OTHER INCENTIVES FOR A VERY DIRTY PROCESS? DO WE WANT TO BRING THAT HOME? > > CHINA IS EITHER GOING TO DO IT IN A VERY DIRTY PROCESS. THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF REGARD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. OR WE CAN HAVE AMERICAN COMPANIES DO IT HERE. HAVING AMERICA LEAD IN PROCESSING, WE WILL DO IT MORE SAFELY THAN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. THAT MEETING HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN STOCKHOLM BETWEEN CHINESE TRADE OFFICIALS AND AMERICAN TRADE OFFICIALS, WHO IS CURRENTLY ON TOP IN THIS NEGOTIATION? SEC. BESSENT: WE HAVE SEEN THAT EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE AND THE UNITED STATES HAS A LOT OF LEVERAGE. THEY WANT A LOT OF THINGS FROM THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING OUR CHIPS AND CONSUMER ECONOMY. WE MATTER TO THEM AS MUCH AS THEY MATTER TO US SO I THINK EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE AND THE GOAL IS TO WALK OUT WITH A BETTER DEAL FOR THE UNITED STATES SO WE ARE MORE PROSPEROUS, MORE FREE, MORE SECURE AND WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THE SECTORS HERE. THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT OUR BIG AI ACTION PLAN. WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE MAKING THAT POSSIBLE. ED: ONE OF THE PLANS IS FOR AMERICA TO EXPORT TECHNOLOGY TO THE WORLD. HOW IMPORTANT IS CHINA AS AN EXPORT MARKET? THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON WHETHER OR NOT CHINA WILL BE AN ECONOMY THAT WANTS THE AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY STACK. IF YOU LISTEN TO XI JINPING, HE WANTS AND INDEPENDENT HARDWARE FOUNDATIONAL SYSTEM, THAT MEANS A CHINESE TECH STACK. WE WILL SEE WHETHER OR NOT XI JINPING AND THE CHINESE ECONOMY WANT AMERICAN TECH. IT IS ALL THE MORE REASON TO DEAL WITH OUR ALLIES LIKE THE EU THAT JUST HAPPENED AND LIKE THE JAPAN THAT JUST HAPPENED, THAT MATTERS. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR TOP 10 ALLIES, THAT IS 60% OR 70 SENT OF GLOBAL GDP. WHAT A WAY TO START TO WORK OUT FROM THERE. CAROLINE: THE ONE AREA OF BIPARTISANSHIP HAS BEEN A HAWKISH NATURE TOWARD CHINA BUT I THINK ABOUT A POTENTIAL BAN ON TIKTOK CURRENTLY NOT HAPPENING. WE THINK ABOUT A POTENTIAL MEETING BETWEEN TRUMP AND XI JINPING, SOME OF THE CHINA HOCKS FEEL FRUSTRATED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GIVING AWAY TOO MUCH FOR A DEAL. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? MICHELLE: I THINK THE BIG PICTURE IS ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE CHIPS IN THE BARGAINING TOOLS. WE WANT TO GET TO A DEAL THAT DOES MAKE US MORE SECURE AND PROSPEROUS. WE HAVE SEEN BACK-AND-FORTH ON TIKTOK. THEN IN JULY THERE WERE ASSURANCES THOSE LICENSE WOULD BE GRANTED TO THEM. IT IS PART OF THE HIGH-STAKES NEGOTIATIONS TAKING PLACE. WE WANT TO GET TO INCENTIVIZING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND SECURITY FIRST. CAROLINE: AND THAT TAKES REGULATION HERE AT HOME, THE AI ACTION PLAN MEANT TO FOSTER GROWTH WHEN IT COMES TO THE UNDERLYING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE IS THIS GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE AND CHINA HAS MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED MODELS, OPEN WANT -- OPEN ONES COMING TO THE FOREFRONT. HOW DO YOU MEASURE HOW FAR CHINA IS IN THE GENERATIVE AI RACE? MICHELLE: I THINK IT IS HOW MANY COUNTRIES AND PARTNERS ARE ADOPTING CHINESE TECH VERSUS AMERICAN TECH AND OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE MORE AMERICAN -- MORE COUNTRIES INVESTING AMERICAN TECH SO THAT THE TECH STACK ACROSS THE WORLD IS TRUSTED. HAVING A SCORECARD WHERE WE TRACK HOW MANY COUNTRIES AND COMPANIES ARE ADOPTING U.S. TECHNOLOGY IS IMPORTANT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO START TO PUT TOGETHER EXPORT ABOUT AI PACKAGES TO THE TAKE THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY. ED: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMING UP, SPOTIFY SHARES DROP AS THE MUSIC STREAMING COMPANY DISAPPOINTS INVESTORS AND WE WILL HAVE THE DETAILS NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. \u266a CAROLINE: SPOTIFY SHARES HAVING THEIR WORST DAY IN TWO YEARS. THE COMPANY REPORTED A LOSS IN THE SECOND QUARTER. LET'S GET MORE ON SPOTIFY EARNINGS. THE STORY SEEMS TO BE ABOUT EMPLOYEE PAY AND TAXES ON THEM. > > IN SOME WAY SPOTIFY IS A VICTIM OF ITS OWN SUCCESS. THEY HAVE SAID BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DOING SO WELL THEY HAVE HAD TO PAY OUT A LOT MORE THAN THEY ANTICIPATED IN PAYROLL TAXES AND WHATNOT AND THAT ENDED UP IN A LOSS IN EARNINGS-PER-SHARE. ED: THERE IS A LOT OF EARNINGS MECHANICS AND FINANCIAL WIZARDRY AROUND THIS STUFF. IS THERE A COURSE SPOTIFY STORY ABOUT HOW IT IS GOING FOR THEM AND MAYBE ABOUT IT? > > SPOTIFY KEEPS ADDING USERS AND GROWERS. THEY HAVE REALLY MADE A PUSH FOR ADVERTISING THAT HASN'T REALLY PANNED OUT. THEY WILL BE RETHINKING THAT APPROACH FOR ADVERTISING. THEY SUGGESTED THIS WILL BE A DIRECTION THEY WILL CHANGE COURSE. THEY ARE MAKING A PUSH. THEY SAID THIS IS A VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY, BUT NOT A NECESSARY OPPORTUNITY. CAROLINE: IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE WEAK DOLLAR PLAYS INTO THIS. THEY ARE BUILDING MORE AND MORE USERS. THEY SAY IT IS GROWING LIKE A WEED. THAT HAS TO BE A POSITIVE MOMENTUM STORY. ASHLEY: THAT IS HOW THEY ARE TRYING TO POSITION THIS. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY GOT A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT. IT IS JUST THESE SHORT-TERM ISSUES. ED: IF IT CLOSED, IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST JUNE SINCE 2023. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU SOMETHING I ASK YOU EVERY QUARTER. HOW WAS SPOTIFY DOING IN PODCASTS? ASHLEY: THEY HAVE REALLY PIVOTED INTO VIDEO PODCASTS AND THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO RECRUIT MORE VIDEO CREATORS. THEY HAVE NOT FOCUSED ON AUDIO PODCASTS. THEY ARE STILL MISSING QUITE A FEW OF THE LARGEST PODCASTERS, BUT THEY ARE STILL PUSHING AND TRYING. CAROLINE: WHERE IS THE AUDIENCE FOR THE GROWTH STORY? ASHLEY: IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS DEVELOPING MARKETS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE DOING MORE TIME DOING AUDIOBOOKS AND UPPER-LEVEL THEM TWO DIFFERENT TIERS OF SUBSCRIPTIONS. ED: ASHLEY CARMON ON THE STREAMING AND SPOTIFY BEAT. LOOK AT SHARES OF THE COMPANY. THEY ARE SEEING SLOWING GROWTH AND PAYMENT VOLUMES. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT U.S. RETAIL AND SOFTENING ECONOMIC CONSUMER DATA, SAYING THEY SEE A SLIGHT ACCELERATION AND THAT HAS WORRIED PEOPLE A BIT. IT WILL BE INTERESTING WHEN WE GET A SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT READ ON THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSUMER OR FINTECH LENS. CAROLINE: FROM THE SHARE PERFORMANCE, IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT STORY. COMING UP, WE HAVE OPENAI BACKED STARTUP AMBIENCE HEALTH CARE. WE SPEAK TO THE COFOUNDER NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. \u266a ED: OPENAI BACKED STARTUP AMBIENCE HEALTH CARE HAS ANNOUNCED IT HAS RAISED $243 MILLION VALLOW DOING -- VALUING THE ADMINISTRATIVE AI COMPANY AT OVER BILLION. THE COFOUNDER AND CHIEF SCIENTIST JOINS US. I ACTUALLY GO BACK TO MAYBE TWO OR THREE YEARS AND THIS IS WHEN PEOPLE SAID THE PROMISE IN THE NEAR TERM WAS AI AND HEALTH CARE , THE ADMINISTRATIVE TASK, BUT THE ROUND IS BIG. WHAT DO YOU NEED 243 MILLION DOLLARS TO DO? NIKHIL: THIS ROUND VALUES THE COMPANY AT .25 BILLION. THAT IS LED BY OAK HDS SEE AND INJURIES AND IS A TESTAMENT TO THE PLATFORM WE HAVE BUILT WHICH ENABLES THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR PATIENT WE HAVE BUILT THIS BEST IN CLASS PLATFORM WHICH IN PRACTICE IS BEFORE THE PATIENT WALKS INTO THE ROOM IT SUMMARIZES ALL THE CONTEXT FOR THE CLINICIANS SO THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE VISITS, ELICITING IN THE BACKGROUND. IT IS GENERATING IT AUTOMATICALLY AND A SUMMARY FOR THE PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILIES EVERY AT IT AS AUTOMATING DOWNSTREAM REVENUE CYCLES. IT IS ALLOWING US TO ESSENTIALLY WORK WITH MANY MORE INSTITUTIONS. WE WORK WITH SOME OF THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY. I THINK THIS IS A TESTAMENT TO THAT WORK. ED: WHAT IS THE COMPANY'S CORE COMPETENCE. WHAT IS IT YOU ARE GOOD AT THAT HAS ALLOWED YOU TO BUILD THE PLATFORM? NIKHIL: WE HAVE BUILT AN INCREDIBLY DEEP WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH OPENAI TO BUILD THE MOST CAPABLE FOUNDATION MODELS FOR HEALTH CARE AND MEDICINE AND WE HAVE PACKAGED THAT INTO A SERIES OF WORKFLOWS. WE WORK WITH ONE OF THE MOST SUB-SPECIALIZED ACADEMIC IN THE COUNTRY. THEY HAVE SPECIALTY AND SUBSPECIALTY AREAS. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MEDICINE, DIFFERENT WORKFLOWS, DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE RULES. IT SERVICES THE NEEDS OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE SPECIALISTS, OVER 80% OF CLINICIANS USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN CLINIC EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR OVER 70% OF THOSE VISITS AND THAT IS MORE THAN 2-3 TIMES SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES IN THE MARKET. CAROLINE: GO TO THAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP YOU WANT TO INVEST IN WITH OPENAI. WHAT MAKES YOUR BUSINESS DEFENSIBLE VERSUS OPENAI BUILDING IT THEMSELVES? NIKHIL: AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE GAP BETWEEN GENERAL-PURPOSE REASONING MODELS THERE IS A MASSIVE GAP BETWEEN MODELS OF TRULY UNDERSTANDING MEDICINE HAPPENING IN EVERY SINGLE VISIT AND WE TALK ABOUT OTHER MEDICAL CENTERS, THE LEVEL OF DEPTH AND CLINICAL REASONING HAPPENING ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES AND HOW THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM PRIMARY CARE TO SEEING AN ONCOLOGIST TO EVEN IN ONCOLOGICAL SUBSPECIALIST. IT IS BRIDGING THE GAP AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONING CAPABILITY OF THESE MODELS THAT ALLOWS US TO BUILD SOFTWARE THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEMS FOR CLINICIANS ON THE FRONT LINES. CAROLINE: WE ARE CURRENTLY SING LIVE PICTURES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP CURRENTLY IN SCOTLAND. HE HAS OPENED A NEW GOLF COURSE HE HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE EU, CONTINUES TO DISCUSS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE U.K. GOING FORWARD. WE WILL BE DIVING INTO THAT AS AND WHEN NECESSARY FOR YOU BUT LET'S RETURN TO YOU AS WE HEAR WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING AND I WANT TO GO TO THE REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE FOR YOUR BUSINESS. I'VE BEEN THINKING IMMEDIATELY ABOUT HEALTH CARE REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY. HOW HAVE YOU MADE SURE THAT IS FRONT AND CENTER WHEN YOU ARE RELYING ON SO MANY DIFFERENT USERS WHO EACH HOSPITAL HAS A DIFFERENT RULE CASE, I'M SURE. NIKHIL: IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. HOW DO WE BUILD AI THAT IS SAFE AND ROLL IT OUT IN A WAY THAT IS EFFECTIVE, WE ARE LUCKY TO BUILD TO CREATE AND TRAIN AI IN A SAFE WAY BUT ALSO THE GOVERNANCE PROCESSES TO ROLL IT OUT RESPONSIBLY. THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS RIGHT IS MASSIVE. YOU THINK ABOUT THE 10,000 SENIORS AGING INTO MEDICARE EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE ARE PROJECTING A SHORTAGE OF 100 PLUS THOUSAND PEOPLE OVER THE NEXT 5-10 YEARS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE AI AND HELP OVERHAUL HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND HAVE BETTER TOOLS FOR OUR CLINICIANS AND TAKE BETTER CARE OF OUR PATIENTS IS PRETTY EXCITING. CAROLINE: WE THANK YOU AS WE SEE LIVE PICTURES IN ABERDEEN OF PRESIDENT TRUMP SURROUNDED BY FAMILY AS HE HAS BEEN UNVEILING GOLF COURSES AND DOING BILATERAL WITH THE U.K. AND THE EU-U.S. TRADE RELATIONSHIP. MICROSOFT AND OPENAI MAY BE CLOSE TO CHANGING THE TERMS OF THEIR OWN PARTNERSHIP. THAT IS NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. \u266a ED: BEST LAID PLANS AS WE WELCOME YOU BACK TO BLOOMBERG TECH, I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU SEMICONDUCTORS WERE OUTPERFORMING AND THEN MOST MAJOR INDICES AS WE WENT TO BREAK FELL AWAY INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY. THERE WAS OUTPERFORMANCE AND CHIPS. NO LONGER THE CASE. AMD GOT ANOTHER UPDATE. RAISING THE PRICE TARGET. I'VE BEEN TRACKING THROUGH THE MONTH OF JULY LOADS OF SELL SIDE NAMES REALLY BOOSTING PRICE TARGETS ON AMD, BUT THE STOCKPOT PERFORMANCE IN THAT PERIOD OUTPACING ANALYSTS ABILITY TO CATCH UP WITH IT. AMD IS GOING TO CATCH UP A LITTLE BIT WITH NVIDIA, WHICH WE ALWAYS SAY HAS A TECHNICAL MONOPOLY. CAROLINE: WE WERE SPEAKING TO LISA SUE AFTER THAT WAS ANNOUNCED. LET\u2019'S SHIFT GEARS INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND OPENAI. THEY ARE IN ADVANCED NEGOTIATIONS THAT COULD CHANGE THAT RELATIONSHIP AND HELP INAUGURATE THE AI AGE. IT WOULD GIVE MICROSOFT ACCESS TO OPENAI'S TEXT EVEN AFTER THE CHATGPT HAS REACHED THE GOAL OF BUILDING ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE. LET'S BRING IN MAP DAY. THIS WAS AN AGE-OLD RELATIONSHIP. THE FINANCIAL BACKING OF OPENAI BROUGHT IT TO IT. THE GOAL WAS THEY WOULD HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO TECH IF THEY DID REACH AGI. MATT: MICROSOFT DOES CONDITION ALL THE INVESTMENT THEY -- MICROSOFT WAS WORRIED THEY WOULD LOSE ACCESS TO THE TECH IF THEY BUILD ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE. MICROSOFT IS GETTING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE CLIFF NOT OCCURRING. ED: WE HAVE HEARD THAT TALKS ARE PROGRESSING, THAT THEY ARE STILL ONGOING. WE HEARD FROM SOURCES THAT IN SUN VALLEY THEY MET TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE. THE PART OF IT ON THE OPENAI SIDE OF THIS IS THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE CORPORATE STRUCTURE. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE MOVING TOWARD THAT? MATT: WE KNOW MICROSOFT IS THE BIGGEST HOLDOUTS OUT TO THAT NEGOTIATING STRUCTURE. WE KNOW OPENAI WANTS MORE FLEXIBILITY AND THE ABILITY TO RAISE MORE MONEY AND THAT IS WHAT IS TICKING THE CLOCK AND BUDGET CASH FROM SOFTBANK. THE BIG INVESTOR HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DIAL DOWN SOME OF THAT INVESTMENT IF OPENAI DOES NOT COMPLETE THE RESTRUCTURE. CAROLINE: ALSO REVENUE SHARE. IT FEELS AS IF OPENAI IS REALIZING HOW MUCH VALUE THEY ARE ADDING, WHAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF IT? MATT: THAT'S RIGHT, IF YOU WIND BACK THE CLOCK, MICROSOFT GOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL. ROLL THE CLOCK FORWARD AND IT TURNS OUT OPENAI WANTS A BIT MORE OF THAT PIE FOR SURE. ED: REALLY APPRECIATE THE REPORTING. WE STICK WITH MICROSOFT WHICH REPORTS EARNINGS TOMORROW. TV TIME. YOU HEARD THE REPORTING. WHEN YOU ARE COVERING MICROSOFT ONE ASSUMES YOU HAVE TO MODEL IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OPENAI, THE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND THE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL. WHAT DID YOU HEAR AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? > > FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON BREAKING THAT NEWS STORY. YOU PUBLISHED ARE NOTE LATER YESTERDAY AND WE DIDN'T COVER THE DETAILED REPORTING THAT YOU DID. THAT CERTAINLY IS A WRINKLE BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE OVERALL PIECES. THE PARTNERSHIP HAS MORE LEGS TO IT THAN COMMONLY BELIEVED IN THE MEDIA AND IN THE WALL STREET COMMUNITY. THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO BE GAINED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FENCE, BE IT ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY OR ACCESS TO DISTRIBUTION. NOT TO OVEREMPHASIZE THE VERY COMMON THING TO TRADE MODELS AND ONBOARD INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK IF THIS WERE TO PROGRESS TO ITS ULTIMATE FRUITION, IT WOULD TAKE AWAY A HURDLE FROM INVESTORS PERSPECTIVE AS TO WHAT IS THE TERM DURATION YOU CAN BANK A NEW MODEL AND WHAT IS THE LONGEVITY OF THIS PARTNERSHIP? THEY HAVE COME OUT OF NOWHERE TO SCALE TO HELP MICROSOFT AXZU -- AZURE BUSINESS. BOTH PARTIES HAVE SO MUCH TO BEGAN FOR THIS. ED: LET ME ASK IT THIS WAY, WHAT IS THE BIGGEST NET BENEFIT TO MICROSOFT FROM THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OPENAI? ANTHONY: MANY THINGS, FIRST OF ALL THAT THEY ARE TECH FORWARD. YOU COULD ARGUE IN THE CLOUD COMPUTING CYCLE THAT THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY THE FIRST ONES OUT OF THE GATE. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT YOU HAVE WITH SATYA NADELLA WHO HAS BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME BEING ABLE TO PIVOT THE COMPANY AT THE RIGHT TIME. THAT IS OF ENORMOUS STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. ALTHOUGH IT HAS REQUIRED A LOT OF CAPITAL BUILDOUT, THEY HAVE NOT SEEN IT IN THE TECHNOLOGY WORLD. DEPENDING UPON WHOSE NUMBERS YOU LOOK AT, IT IS AROUND AND $80 BILLION RUN RATE AND AI HAS HELPED KEEP THAT GROWTH RATE STUDY. IF WE GET AN INFLECTION POINT. AI IS STUCK AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER. WHEN YOU MAKE THE PROGRESSION, YOU SEE MONUMENTAL SHIFTS HAPPENING IN THE MARKET. CAROLINE: THE $80 BILLION RUN RATE COMES IN TANDEM CASH WITH A NEED TO SPEND ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURE. IS THAT CURRENTLY TOTALLY VINDICATED IN YOUR MINDS EYE OR WILL WE SEE AN INCREASE? > > IT IS DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. ROUGHLY GIVE OR TAKE. WITHIN THAT, THERE WERE SLIGHTLY MORE INEFFICIENT CONVERSION INTO AI REVENUE AND SLIGHTLY MORE EFFICIENT. WE THINK IT IS THE RIGHT TRADE-OFF AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND THE GOOD NEWS IF YOU ARE MICROSOFT IS YOU ARE RUNNING A VERY DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS. ALL THE CAPEX IS NOT EXTREMELY PUNITIVE. THEY DO GENERATE THIS MEANINGFUL SIGNIFICANCE. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MICROSOFT WITH THE BROADER CLOUD BUSINESS, THEN YOU HAVE THE SERVER ON PREMISES BUSINESS AND A COUPLE OF OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF REVENUE SCROLL AND IN TERMS OF PROFITABILITY. THEY HAVE THE CASH TO FUND THE CAPEX AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. IF YOU CAN GENERATE A DOLLAR OF REVENUE FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF, AS LONG AS THAT BROADLY HOLDS. CAROLINE: THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS AROUND MICROSOFT, WHETHER OR NOT HOW GREAT THE PRODUCT IS TO USE. BUT ALSO THE CYBER ISSUES WE HAVE SEEN RUNNING FRONT AND CENTER THIS MONTH. HOW MUCH DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO REALLY TALK TO THOSE ISSUES? > > YEAH, I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LAG BETWEEN THE ACTUAL CHATGPT TECHNOLOGY AND HOW MUCH OF THAT GETS INCORPORATED INTO MICROSOFT OFFICE COPILOT AND I THINK THAT LAG IS LIKELY TO REDUCE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND WE ARE IMPLEMENTING CONSUMER GRADE TECHNOLOGY. I'M NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD WITH RESPECT TO WHERE THE PRODUCT IS WITH REGARD TO ENTERPRISE EXPECTATIONS. IT HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE SIX OR NINE MONTHS AGO. IT IS LIKELY TO GO A LONG WAY IN THE FUTURE. THAT VERSION OF COPILOT WILL GO THROUGH SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS . ALL OF IT WILL GET SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SO THE BUZZ IS GOING TO GET BETTER. ED: PRESENT-DAY MIDDLE OF 2025, MICROSOFT IS THE WORLD'S SECOND MOST VALUABLE COMPANY. IF I THINK BACK TO WHEN I ARRIVED IN SILICON VALLEY, DID YOU SEE THAT COMING, WHERE MICROSOFT WOULD VIE WITH NVIDIA TO BE THE MOST VALUABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD BASED ON THE DIRECTION IT WAS HEADED PRE-OPENAI AND ALL OF THAT? > > WE HAD A BIG PRICE TARGET ON MICROSOFT AND THE PUSHBACK WE GOT WAS YOU WERE IMPLYING IN IT CAP CAN GROW AND IT IS ALREADY A MULTITRILLION DOLLAR MARKET. I THINK WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS IF YOU UNLOCK A BIG TECH CYCLE EVERY TECH CYCLE IS LARGER AND LARGER AND IF YOU ARE LEADING THIS CYCLE, NOBODY ENVISIONED THIS THE WAY IT DID. WE ARE STILL EARLY IN AI. IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN YOU GOT A LOT MORE VALUE CREATION. I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY HOW QUICKLY THIS HAPPENED BUT I WAS JUST REMARKING EARLIER THAT IT HAS PERFORMED IN LINE SINCE THE LAUNCH OF CHATGPT. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT FACILITATED THE BIRTH OF THE AI REVOLUTION AND THE STOCK LAGGING DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. SO FEELING SOME VINDICATION. ED: GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE ON BLOOMBERG TECH. SOME NEWS. CAROLINE: TIME FOR TALKING TECH. DOORDASH, SPOTIFY'S GLOBAL HEAD OF ADVERTISING JOINS THE FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY HAS CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER AND HE PREVIOUSLY LED SPOTIFY'S $2 BILLION ADD BUSINESS AND IS SET TO OVERSEE DOORDASH'S REVENUE. WAYMO IS SET TO LAUNCH ITS ROBOTAXI SERVICE IN DALLAS IN A PARTNERSHIP. WAYMO SAYS AVIS WILL SERVE AS A FLEET PARTNER PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE, MAINTENANCE, THE DALLAS DEAL MARKS A MULTIYEAR PARTNERSHIP AS THEY EXPAND INTO MORE CITIES OVER TIME. A VENTURE DEBT FIRM HAS RAISED $685 MILLION TO MAKE LOANS TO ABOUT LOANS TO STARTUPS. THE LATEST INVESTMENT BRINGS THE ESSENCE UNDER MANAGEMENT TO ABOUT .4 BILLION. ED: COMING UP, THE SOPHIA CEO JOINS US -- SOFI CEO TO DISCUSS THE QUARTER. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. \u266a ED: SHARES OF SOPHIA CLIMBING AFTER THE COMPANY PERFORMED A JUMP IN FEE-BASED REVENUES. LET'S DISCUSS WITH THE MAN IN CHARGE. THE SOPHIA STORY HAS BECOME SIMPLE. YOU HAVE INVESTED IN FEE BASED BUSINESS LINES. THEY HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT BUT WHAT THE MARKET SEEMS TO BE SEEING IS THAT FLOWING THROUGH TO THE BOTTOM LINE AS WELL. WOULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT WENT IN THE QUARTER? ANTHONY: SURE, WE HAVE MADE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO DIVERSIFY OUR BUSINESS INTO THESE LESS CREDIT RISK, FEWER REVENUE STREAMS. THE LOAN PLATFORM BUSINESS WERE PEOPLE PAY US TO USE OUR ORIGINATION PLATFORMS TO USE OUR MARKETING CAPABILITIES TO PRODUCE FOR A FEE THAT THEY PAY US. WE ALSO GENERATE FEES IN OUR SOFI MONEY ACCOUNT BUSINESS AND THE BROKERAGE BUSINESS AND OUR CREDIT CARD BUSINESSES. AS WE DIVERSIFY THE PRODUCTS WE OFFER, THE REVENUE STREAMS, 44% OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM THESE FEES THAT ARE GENERATED WITHOUT USE OF CAPITAL AND CREDIT RISK SO THAT D RISKS THE BALANCE SHEET QUITE A BIT. IT IS REFLECTIVE OF THAT DIVERSIFICATION AND LESS RISKY REVENUE THAT IS MORE VISIBLE AS WELL. ED: YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT DE-RISKING. ELSEWHERE IN THE EARNINGS DOMAIN, PAYPAL WAS ASKED ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. CONSUMER AND COMMENTS FROM THAT COMPANY WERE SOMEWHAT NEGATIVE. THEY SEE SOME CRACKS IN THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSUMER. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? ANTHONY: WE ARE APPEALING TO THE OVERACHIEVERS IN THE UNITED STATES. TO ACHIEVE THEIR LONG-TERM AMBITIONS. WE ARE HELPING THEM SPEND LESS THAN THEY MAKE AND INVEST THE REST. WE ARE SEEING STRONG TRENDS FROM THEM. REFINANCING OUT OF EXPENSIVE CREDIT CARD DEBT THE CHARGES 24% TO 34% INTEREST TO OUR LOANS. WE SEE THEM MOVING THEIR MONEY INTO SOPHIA MONEY. AND IF YOU ARE A DIRECT DEPOSIT CUSTOMER. WE OFFER THEM INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE REALLY ATTRACTIVE. WE OFFER STOCKS WITHOUT COMMISSIONS, FRACTIONAL SHARES. WE HAVE ETF'S THAT ARE AWARD-WINNING AND ROBO ACCOUNTS. WE OFFER IPO'S IN ADDITION TO THAT PRIVATE EQUITY TO INVEST IN PRIVATE CREDIT, PRIVATE REAL ESTATE, VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING AND FINALLY PRIVATE GROWTH EQUITY CAPABILITIES. A MUCH MORE DIVERSE BUSINESS. OUR CONSUMER IS VERY STRONG, CREDIT, SPENDING THROUGH SOPHIA MONEY IS ALSO VERY STRONG. WE ARE SEEING A CONSUMER REALLY TRYING TO LOWER THEIR COSTS AND SPEND THE LAST AND THE FLYWHEEL IS REALLY WORKING. CAROLINE: IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE FLYWHEEL COMES AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MARKET HAS A FLYWHEEL OF ITS OWN. WE ARE SEEING FROTH IN CERTAIN SECTORS. GETTING IN ON THE LATEST MEME STOCK AS WELL AS THE IPO. HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT IT ON THE EDUCATION SIDE OF THINGS? ARE THEY DIVERSIFIED ENOUGH? ANTHONY: SURE AND LET ME TALK ABOUT WHAT I THINK ARE TWO TECHNOLOGY SUPER CYCLES, WE ARE DRIVING THE GROWTH OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF CRYPTO OR BLOCKCHAIN OR AI BUT I THINK THE COMBINATION OF BLOCKCHAIN OR CRYPTO AS WELL AS OPENAI ARE TWO SUPER CYCLES THAT WILL PUT A TAILWIND BEHIND HER COMPANY AND WILL HELP US REVOLUTIONIZE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN WAYS THAT WILL GIVE PEOPLE FASTER WAYS TO SEND MONEY AT LOWER COSTS AND TO DO IT SAFER IN ADDITION TO BEING ABLE TO INVEST IN THIS ASSET CLASS WHICH DOES HELP AS IT RELATES TO AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY THAT MAY NOT HAVE EXPOSURE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AND ITS STABILITY IN ADDITION TO BE ABLE TO BORROW AGAINST THAT ASSET WHICH WILL LOWER THEIR COST OF FUNDING AND IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO PAY ACROSS BORDERS MORE EASILY AND QUICKER. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS HELPING US TODAY ACROSS OUR ENTIRE BUSINESS. WE ARE USING IT IN THE BACK OFFICE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES FASTER, TO FILE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS, TO SOLVE ACCOUNT TAKEOVER ISSUES FASTER. ON THE CONSUMER SIDE WE ARE OFFERING CASH COACH, THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT YOUR CASH ACROSS ALL YOUR ACCOUNTS. THAT IS NOT IMPACTING OUR RESULTS. THEY ARE EXCITING SUPER CYCLES TO SEE THE BENEFITS FROM. ED: WE ACTUALLY HAVE BREAKING NEWS CROSSING THE TERMINAL AND IT COMES FROM CHINA'S TRADE ENVOY. HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF TALKS IN STOCKHOLM. THE U.S. AND CHINA HAVE AGREED TO EXTEND THE TRADE TRUTHS EXCHANGING VIEWS ON VARIOUS MACROECONOMIC ISSUES. THEY AGREE ON SAFEGUARDING TRADE AND THAT TALKS EVENT CONSTRUCTIVE ON MAJOR TOPICS. THE HEADLINE IS THAT THEY HAVE AGREED TO EXTEND THE TRADE TRUTHS AND THAT THE TALKS BETWEEN CHINA AND U.S. NEGOTIATORS CURRENTLY IN STOCKHOLM AND WILL CONTINUE IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION. CAROLINE: COMING UP FOR YOU, MEDA SET TO REPORT EARNINGS AFTER THE CLOSING BELL. WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT SPENDING BIG ON AI TALENT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. \u266a ED: META SET TO REPORT EARNINGS AFTER THE CLOSING BELL. ON WEDNESDAY, I BELIEVE IT IS WITH INVESTORS CLOSELY WATCHING AI INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE SOME BIG M'S TO THINK ABOUT MORE BROADLY AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE WE GO IN TERMS OF THE SPENDING EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT? IS IT ABOUT TALENT OR CAPEX? > > I THINK THAT IS THE SPECULATION ONCE YOU SAW WHAT GOOGLE DID LAST WEEK I THINK THERE IS SOME ASSUMPTION THAT THEY MAY DO THE SAME THEY ALREADY RAISED THE RANGE FOR THE CAPEX LAST QUARTER AS WELL. THERE WAS A DIFFERENT NUMBER IN JANUARY, A DIFFERENT NUMBER IN APRIL AND WE WILL WATCH TOMORROW TO SEE IF THERE WAS A NUMBER NEW NUMBER. GIVEN THE SPEND IN AI I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY GO THAT ROUTE. ED: YET WE ARE REMINDED THAT META MAKES ALL ITS MONEY FROM ADVERTISING SO IS THE AI STORY WHERE ADS ARE PRICED BETTER OR IS ALL THE INVESTMENT GOING TO PAY OFF? WHAT IS THE STREET EXPECTING? > > THE GOOD NEWS FOR THEM IS THAT THE AI STORY THEY ARE TELLING TODAY FEELS MORE URGENT AND TIMELY THAN THE ONE THEY WERE TELLING THE LAST YEAR OR TWO WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE METAVERSE. NOW THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT CHATBOTS, LLM'S, DATA CENTERS, PEOPLE THINGS HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME IS. THE METAVERSE WAS THE MAIN THING THEY WERE SINKING MONEY INTO AND THERE WAS NO REAL END IN SIGHT TO THAT. I DON'T THINK THERE IS AN END IN SIGHT TO AI EITHER BUT I -- BUT THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING NOW THAT IS EASIER TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND. ED: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
