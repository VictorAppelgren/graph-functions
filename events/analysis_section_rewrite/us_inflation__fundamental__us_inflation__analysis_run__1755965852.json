      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid starting point but still falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year, first‑principles analysis. First, the causal chain is too surface‑level: you mention “AI‑driven automation” and “margin expansion” but never tie them to a concrete real‑rate or terms‑of‑trade anchor that would explain how Amazon’s valuation should evolve under different Fed scenarios. Replace vague statements with a clear regime diagram: (1) low‑real‑rate, high‑AI‑adoption regime → AWS margin growth 8‑12 % CAGR, Amazon’s free‑cash‑flow yield 4‑5 %; (2) high‑real‑rate, inflation‑tight regime → AWS margin compression 2‑4 % and Amazon’s share price reverts to 10‑15 % discount to a 12‑year average. Do the same for Shopify: link its 31 % revenue growth to a 12‑year e‑commerce penetration rate of 12 % rising to 15 % and model the impact on its gross‑margin lift (from 16 % to 20 %) under a 2 % real‑rate scenario. Quantify the “AI‑driven automation” catalyst: cite AWS’s 2024 revenue of $24 bn and projected 2025 growth 20 % (EETJ5BIEJ) and show how a 1 % margin lift translates to $200 m incremental earnings. For HealthStream, replace the generic “modest growth” with a 5‑year CAGR of 3.5 % (YTHAU3SIB) and a debt‑free balance sheet that gives a 1.5× debt‑to‑EBITDA buffer. The dividend section needs a valuation framework: use AbbVie’s 18.2× forward P/E (QZXKE5CBL) and a 3.2 % yield to project a 2 % dividend growth rate under a 2 % real‑rate regime, and contrast it with a 5 % real‑rate scenario that forces a 10 % payout cut. Add a risk matrix that maps Fed policy, AI adoption, and drug‑pricing shocks to each regime. Citations: every numeric claim must be linked to a source ID (e.g., AWS revenue 2024 from EETJ5BIEJ, Amazon’s 37 % 5‑year return from EETJ5BIEJ, HealthStream’s 6.89 % margin from YTHAU3SIB). Finally, tighten the narrative: start with a one‑sentence thesis, then a bullet‑style regime table, followed by a concise risk‑watch list. This structure will satisfy the SECTION FOCUS, provide first‑principles anchors, and deliver the depth, clarity, and quantification you need.",
