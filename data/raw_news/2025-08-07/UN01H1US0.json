  "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin remains hesitant about trilateral meeting with President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Russia says conditions for Ukraine peace negotiations not yet created.",
  "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday confirmed he discussed a trilateral meeting to include Russian President Vladimir Putin, potentially as soon as next week, in a call with President Donald Trump one day prior. Zelenskyy \u2013 who echoed comments issued by Trump on Wednesday and said the discussion was also held with European leaders \u2013 called on Putin to \"be brave\" and take the meeting.\"Yesterday, various potential formats for leader-level meetings to bring peace were also discussed \u2013 two bilateral and one trilateral,\" he said in a post on X. \"Ukraine is not afraid of meetings and expects the same brave approach from the Russian side. It is time we ended the war.\"A HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN TRUMP AND PUTIN COULD OCCUR WITHIN 10 DAYSThe comments came after months of attempts by the Trump administration to get Putin to sit down with Zelenskyy, which the Kremlin chief has thus far refused. It appeared unlikely that he would agree to it this time around either, as Russian state media on Thursday reported Putin as being open to the idea, but said \"conditions must be created for negotiations to take place.\"The \"conditions\" were also reported to be \"far from being created,\" according to a Telegram post by Russian state news agency RIA.Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisor further claimed on Thursday that the issue of a trilateral meeting was \"mentioned\" but \"not discussed\" during Putin's talks with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and later, Trump.TRUMP HAILS 'HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE' TALKS WITH PUTIN DESPITE NO CEASEFIRE, 'SECONDARY TARIFFS' STILL ON\"As for the option of a trilateral meeting, which for some reason was discussed yesterday in Washington, this option was simply mentioned by the American representative during the meeting in the Kremlin. But this option was not specifically discussed,\" Kremlin foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov said. \"The Russian side left this option completely, without comment.\"We propose first of all to focus on preparing a bilateral meeting with D. Trump and we believe that the main thing is for this meeting to be successful and productive,\" he added. Zelenskyy said he had been in discussions with both German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday to ensure Europe\u2019s interests were also at the forefront of any U.S.-Russia-Ukraine discussions. \"We are coordinating our positions, and we equally see the need for a common European view on key security issues for Europe,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Much depends \u2013 both now and in the long term \u2013 on the prudence and effectiveness of each step taken by Europe and America.\"Both Germany and France have taken on leadership roles when it comes to the war in Ukraine and protecting Europe\u2019s interests following Trump\u2019s re-entrance into the White House earlier this year. The U.K. has also been at the forefront of these discussions, though Fox News Digital could not immediately confirm whether Zelenskyy had also already discussed the trilateral meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",

We discussed what was spelled out in Moscow,\" he added. \"Ukraine will definitely defend its independence. We all need a lasting and reliable peace.\n\"Russia must end the war that it itself started,\" Zelenskyy said.\nTRUMP OFFICIALS VISIT GAZA AID SITES AS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PRESSURES ISRAEL\nFew details have emerged from the three-hour meeting with Russian foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov also having described the meeting as \"useful and constructive.\"\nUshakov said Putin \"received some signals from Trump\" and \"sent some signals,\" but he did not elaborate on any specifics.\nThe advisor also told reporters that Putin and Witkoff had discussed developing the \"strategic partnership\" between the U.S. and Russia but did not elaborate how. The comment came after Witkoff was spotted earlier in the day taking a walk near the Kremlin with Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian president\u2019s envoy for investment and economic cooperation.\nWitkoff and Putin met shortly before noon in Moscow, according to the timestamp released by the Kremlin which accompanied an image of Putin and Witkoff smiling and shaking hands as Ushakov looked on.\nWitkoff\u2019s team did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions on what the envoy was hoping to accomplish in his meeting with Putin, though some reporting this week suggested he may look to secure a moratorium on air strikes.\nWitkoff traveled to Moscow in a last-ditch effort to get Putin to capitulate to Trump\u2019s and Western calls for an end to the war, though the Kremlin chief was not expected to make great concessions in ending his war ambitions ahead of the trip.\nIn mid-July, while seated next to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump promised to enforce \"very severe\" tariffs on Russia if Putin does not enter into a deal with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy within 50 days.\n\"Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs,\" he had said, implying that nations who trade with Russia will see 100% tariffs slapped on them when trading with the U.S.\nHe then pushed the date up to within 10 days of July 29, forcing the new deadline for Friday.\nBut on Tuesday Trump walked back his 100% tariff threat amid tough trade talks with India and China, and said, \"I never said a percentage.\"\n\"We'll see what happens over the next fairly short period of time,\" he added in response to questions from reporters. \"We have a meeting with Russia\u2026We're going to see what happens.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"We'll make that determination at that time,\" he added.\nThe tariffs would most drastically target China and India, which are the largest purchasers of Russian oil, though high tariffs on those nations, both of which are major traders with the U.S., would also mean higher prices for the American consumer."
