  "content": "Charlotte Dawson has hit back at trolls who have told her she is the 'biggest she's ever been' as the reality star opened up about her post-partum weight gain.\n\nThe daughter of late comedian Les Dawson, 32, welcomed her third baby, Gigi Dawson Sarsfield, in March.\n\nThe star has been open about her weight over the years, and how her body has changed after each of her three pregnancies with sons Noah, four, and Jude, one, and daughter Gigi, four months.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Sunday, Charlotte promoted her Belleh Blaster plan with a weight comparison post.\n\nShe shared a before-and-after snap of her body where she could be seen slimmed down following the birth of Noah on the left.\n\nMeanwhile, on the right, Charlotte could be seen shaking her body, as she admitted she's been in 'no rush' to lose the weight.\n\nShe wrote: 'Send help! No wait - that\u2019s me! I\u2019ve done it before guys - twice. After Noah and Jude but this time is definitely going to be the hardest.\n\n'As so many people have kindly pointed out I\u2019m the biggest I\u2019ve ever been after having my gorgeous Gigi.\n\n'But I\u2019ve not been in a rush to lose the weight - I\u2019ve had a few other things on my plate! (Apart from chips & graveh!)'\n\nCharlotte continued: 'But I\u2019m back on my fabulous Belleh Blaster plan and I would LOVE your support and inspo to keep me going.. So if you need to shift a bit of timber too please join me on my journey.\n\n'Just go to bellehblaster.com or click the chuffin link above and let\u2019s get dead sexeh togevs - dancing round our living rooms and having a right laff.\n\n'PLUS eating gorgeous proper grub. You know you want to! There is something for everyone you look forward to doing it instead of dreading it!! And we have 50% OFF all plans don\u2019t miss out !'\n\nIt comes days after Charlotte took to social media to promote her Dawsylicious Tanning range amid her financial difficulties.\n\nAccording to documents on Companies House, the reality star's business is facing a \u00a388,000 tax bill and issued an appointment of voluntary liquidation in May.\n\nCharlotte co-owns the wholesale clothing and footwear brand with her fianc\u00e9 Matt Sarsfield. She is also known to have a separate tanning brand, Dawsylicious Tanning.\n\nThe star promoted the brand in the new clip, where she confidently danced in her garden in a bright two-piece.\n\nAlongside the clip, she penned: 'Ps yes I know I\u2019m chunkeh but funkeh but im appeh x this is your sign to show you to wear that damn bikini x.'\n\nCharlotte and Matt managed to patch up their relationship last year after the news broke of the former rugby player's sexting scandal.\n\nAnd now the couple, who share sons Noah, four, and Jude, 20 months and daughter Gigi, two months, must face their financial problems together.\n\nDocuments show the company has \u00a315,000 in assets, reducing her debts to an estimated deficit of \u00a373,300.\n\nSince starting the business in May 2020, Dawsylicious has been issued three strike notices, the most recent being in April 2024.\n\nHer accounts were due by February 29, 2024 and her confirmation statement was due on June 2, 2024. Both are marked as overdue.\n\nDawsylicious is Charlotte's only limited company listed on Companies House and is described as a wholesale of clothing and footwear.\n\nShe also has her separate tanning brand, Dawsylicious Tanning.\n\nDailyMail contacted Charlotte's representatives for comment at the time.",
