      "text": "The Cleveland Browns were founded in 1944 and began their first season as a professional football team in 1946. Their inaugural NFL game was on September 6, 1946, where they defeated the former Miami Seahawks 44-0 at Municipal Stadium, the Browns' home field until 1995 before the team relocated to Baltimore. The Browns concluded their first NFL season with a 13-2 record.\nOhio businessman Arthur B. McBride acquired the Cleveland Browns and appointed Paul Brown as head coach. During his tenure from 1946 to 1962, Brown achieved a 167-53-8 record with the franchise. He was fired in 1963 and later founded the Cincinnati Bengals.\nThe Cleveland Browns had a remarkable first decade in NFL history, winning four AAFC titles and three championships in 1950, 1954, and 1955. The team has not won a title since securing the NFL Championship in 1964.\nNotable athletes in Browns history include Hall of Fame inductees: quarterback Clay Matthews Jr., wide receiver Paul Warfield, quarterback Otto Graham, defensive end Dante Lavelli, fullback Jim Brown, and offensive tackle Joe Thomas.\nIn 2017, the Browns selected defensive end Myles Garrett as the first overall NFL Draft pick. Garrett, often regarded as a dominant athlete in the league, signed a four-year extension worth $40 million per year, with $123.5 million guaranteed, in early 2025.\nModern-day Browns stars include cornerback Denzel Ward, who signed a five-year extension with the team in 2022. Former Browns running back Nick Chubb, a beloved powerhouse, signed a one-year deal with the Houston Texans in June 2025. Former wide receiver Jarvis Landry, released by the franchise in 2021, was a key player from 2018 to 2022."

Two weeks later, he went 101 in a 60 and failed to appear in court for both citations.\nThe quarterback said he haas learned from his mistakes, and it seems that his general manager, Andrew Berry, assisted in teaching him a thing or two.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\"Not smart. Just not smart,\" Berry told reporters this week about the tickets. \"It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve addressed with him. Look, he understands the implications, he understands the consequences.
