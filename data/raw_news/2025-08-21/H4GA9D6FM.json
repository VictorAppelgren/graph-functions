      "text": "Guidance in Uncharted Territory: Three Commission Cases Signal New Era in EU Competition Enforcement\nIn this blog post, authors Robert Klotz & Maira Aivalioti (Steptoe) talk about how the European Commission is increasingly open to supporting joint initiatives among competitors when such efforts align with EU policy priorities like sustainability and agriculture. Through two recent informal guidance letters and one opinion, the Commission demonstrated a willingness to clarify gray areas in competition law while encouraging collaborations that promote broader EU objectives. This reflects a shift toward a more adaptive enforcement strategy, where the Commission positions itself not only as an enforcer but also as a partner for businesses navigating complex regulatory environments.\nFeatured News\nNexstar to Acquire Tegna in $6.2 Billion Deal, Testing US Media Ownership Rules\nAug 21, 2025 by\nCPI\nAlphabet Faces Regulatory Uncertainty as DOJ Decision Nears\nAug 21, 2025 by\nCPI\nEU Tech Regs Survive, For Now, in Trade Agreement With US\nAug 21, 2025 by\nCPI\nHome Depot Secures Antitrust Clearance for GMS Deal in the US\nAug 21, 2025 by\nCPI\nEx-Baker McKenzie Partner Launches Austrian Antitrust Boutique\nAug 21, 2025 by\nCPI\nAntitrust Mix by CPI\nAntitrust Chronicle\u00ae \u2013 State Attorneys General\nAug 18, 2025 by\nCPI\nCPI TALKS\u2026 with Attorney General Aaron D.

      "text": "HomeOffice of the SpokespersonPress Releases...Announcement of a Visa Restriction Policy Targeting Foreign Nationals Who Censor Americans hide Announcement of a Visa Restriction Policy Targeting Foreign Nationals Who Censor Americans Press Statement Marco Rubio, Secretary of State May 28, 2025 Free speech is among the most cherished rights we enjoy as Americans. This right, legally enshrined in our constitution, has set us apart as a beacon of freedom around the world. Even as we take action to reject censorship at home, we see troubling instances of foreign governments and foreign officials picking up the slack. In some instances, foreign officials have taken flagrant censorship actions against U.S. tech companies and U.S. citizens and residents when they have no authority to do so. Today, I am announcing a new visa restriction policy that will apply to foreign nationals who are responsible for censorship of protected expression in the United States. It is unacceptable for foreign officials to issue or threaten arrest warrants on U.S. citizens or U.S. residents for social media posts on American platforms while physically present on U.S. soil. It is similarly unacceptable for foreign officials to demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies or engage in censorship activity that reaches beyond their authority and into the United States. We will not tolerate encroachments upon American sovereignty, especially when such encroachments undermine the exercise of our fundamental right to free speech. This visa restriction policy is pursuant to Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which authorizes the Secretary of State to render inadmissible any alien whose entry into the Unites States \u201cwould have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d Certain family members may also be covered by these restrictions.
