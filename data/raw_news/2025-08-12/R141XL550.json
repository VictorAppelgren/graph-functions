  "content": "is a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment. He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nJust a few days after administrators announced that the \u201cfederal Judiciary is taking additional steps to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents in response to recent escalated cyberattacks,\u201d the New York Times reports investigators have found evidence Russia is \u201cat least partially responsible\u201d for a recent hack. Politico reported on the breach last week, saying it was \u201cbelieved to have exposed sensitive court data across multiple U.S. states\u201d and that while the system\u2019s managers had been aware of its impact since around July 4th, they are still trying to figure out its full extent.\n\nAfter the SolarWinds breach in 2021, new procedures called for highly sensitive documents to be filed using paper or a secure electronic device, and not uploaded to CM/ECF. In 2022, the DOJ reportedly informed the judiciary of another ongoing breach.\n\nAccording to the Times, district court chief judges were warned last month to keep cases with documents \u201crelated to criminal activity with an overseas tie\u201d off of the usual document management system for federal cases, which is made up of the Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) where files are uploaded and managed, as well as PACER, a database that\u2019s available to the public. It points to this order issued Friday by Eastern District of New York chief judge Margo Brodie, saying that, until further notice, \u201ccriminal cases and in cases related to criminal investigations are prohibited from being filed in CM/ECF,\u201d and are instead to be uploaded to a separate system that doesn\u2019t connect to PACER.\n\nThe vast majority of documents filed with the Judiciary\u2019s electronic case management system are not confidential and indeed are readily available to the public, which is fundamental to an open and transparent judicial system. However, some filings contain confidential or proprietary information that are sealed from public view. These sensitive documents can be targets of interest to a range of threat actors. To better protect them, courts have been implementing more rigorous procedures to restrict access to sensitive documents under carefully controlled and monitored circumstances.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

      "text": "The federal courts\u2019 document system was hit by a breach with a \u201cstartling breadth and scope\u201d in early 2020, according to a report from Politico that cites testimony from House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler. The Department of Justice (DOJ) reportedly informed the judiciary about the breach in March and told lawmakers that an investigation is ongoing. Other lawmakers, such as Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), expressed concern that the DOJ had been hiding information about the breach and was refusing to explain it to the public and Congress.\nNadler reportedly said that the \u201csystem security failure\u201d was the work of \u201cthree hostile foreign actors,\u201d though, according to Reuters, security officials for the DOJ didn\u2019t specify which countries could be involved.\nThe courts have since moved their most sensitive files to paper or offline USB drives\nIn early 2021, the federal judiciary system announced that it would be going low-tech for its most sensitive documents, saying that they\u2019d have to be delivered by hand instead of going through the publicly available Case Management and Electronic Case Files system. At the time, it cited the SolarWinds attack, which gave hackers access to the systems of dozens of businesses and government agencies, as the reason for the policy change. Although the SolarWinds attack is also thought to have begun in early 2020, the breach disclosed by Nadler is reportedly a separate incident.\nAt the moment, details about what the attackers had access to or how they managed to get into the judiciary\u2019s systems aren\u2019t publicly available. It\u2019s also unclear when the attack was discovered by DOJ officials. The National Security Division of the Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to The Verge\u2019s request for comment about the hack and subsequent investigation.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- This see-thru Game Boy is a work of art \u2014 because she designed a transparent circuit board"

      "text": "The list of companies and agencies discovering that they\u2019ve been affected by the SolarWinds hack is still growing, and they\u2019re working with a big unknown: how far the hackers got into their systems. The federal judiciary system is likely now one of them (via The Wall Street Journal), and it isn\u2019t taking any chances. It\u2019s worried enough that court workers will now have to physically deliver sensitive documents, despite the ongoing pandemic.\nThe judiciary\u2019s new procedures sound rather intense:\nUnder the new procedures announced today, highly sensitive court documents (HSDs) filed with federal courts will be accepted for filing in paper form or via a secure electronic device, such as a thumb drive, and stored in a secure stand-alone computer system. These sealed HSDs will not be uploaded to CM/ECF.\nThe message here is clear: the judiciary does not want its most sensitive documents on the system until it figures out what the hackers have done to it, and it\u2019s willing to add quite a bit of friction to the process of filing the documents. They can no longer just send them through the internet; they\u2019ll have to hand-deliver actual paper or USB sticks.\nWe fully appreciate the practical implications of taking these steps and the administrative burden they will place on courts, yet any such burdens are outweighed by the need to preserve the confidentiality of sealed filings that are at risk of compromise.\nThe documents in question are not necessarily the regular sealed records of everyday court proceedings. The Wall Street Journal article points out that the HSDs could contain detailed explanations of how investigators work a case, as well as information on people who could currently be under surveillance. Knowing this information could help someone avoid detection or investigation, which is why it\u2019s so important to keep it secure.\nWhile the measures show that the judiciary feels it can\u2019t trust its existing networks, the public\u2019s access to court records won\u2019t be changing. Any records that would\u2019ve been publicly available will still be uploaded to the Case Management and Electronic Case Files system.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- This see-thru Game Boy is a work of art \u2014 because she designed a transparent circuit board"
