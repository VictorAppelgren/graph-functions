Remove any claim that cannot be sourced.  \n7. **Eliminate generic platitudes** (“robust cash flow,” “high margin”) unless backed by a specific number; replace with precise figures (e.g., Netflix’s 29.5 % margin, Ford’s 10 % ROIC).  \n8. **Align with the section focus**: frame the brief as a “house view” that integrates fundamentals, medium‑term catalysts, and short‑term watch‑items, and ends with a clear recommendation (e.g., “maintain a bullish stance pending Fed easing and Nvidia guidance”).  \n9. **Check for coherence**: ensure the causal chain flows logically (rate differential → capital outflows → credit tightening → earnings‑premia → equity valuation).  \n10. **Proofread for length**: keep the final output within 4–6 sentences or bullet points, no more than ~250 words.",
