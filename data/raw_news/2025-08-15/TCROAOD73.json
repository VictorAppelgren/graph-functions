  "content": "DETROIT, Aug. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE: RKT) (the \"Company\" or \"Rocket Companies\"), the Detroit-based fintech platform including mortgage, real estate, title and personal finance businesses, announced the early tender results as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 15, 2025 (the \"Early Tender Deadline\"), of the previously announced tender offers and consent solicitations (collectively, the \"Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations\") for the outstanding (i) 5.125% Senior Notes due 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\") and (ii) 5.750% Senior Notes due 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\" and, together with the 2030 Notes, the \"Notes\") of Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. (\"Nationstar\"), a subsidiary of Mr. Cooper Group Inc. (\"Mr. Cooper\"). The Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations are being conducted in connection with the Company's pending acquisition of Mr. Cooper (the \"Mr. Cooper Acquisition\").\n\nThe below table presents, according to information provided to the Company by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the Depositary and Information Agent for the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations, the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline (the \"Early Tender Notes\"), and the percent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding constituting Early Tender Notes.\n\nBecause the Company received consents in respect of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes then outstanding (excluding Notes owned by Nationstar, or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with Nationstar) (the \"Requisite Consents\"), Nationstar executed and delivered a supplemental indenture to each Indenture (each, a \"Supplemental Indenture\"), (i) eliminating the requirement to make a \"Change of Control\" offer for the related Notes following the consummation of the Company's acquisition of Mr. Cooper and future transactions, (ii) eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the applicable Indenture and the Notes, (iii) eliminating certain conditions to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance in the applicable Indenture and the Notes and (iv) eliminating all events of default other than events of default relating to the failure to pay principal of and interest on the Notes (collectively, the \"Proposed Amendments\").\n\nEach Supplemental Indenture became effective upon execution, but provides that the applicable Proposed Amendments will not become operative until the Company accepts for purchase the Notes satisfying the Requisite Consents in the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations.\n\nThe Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 2, 2025, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Company (the \"Expiration Date\"). The \"Settlement Date\" is expected to be on or before the second day following the Expiration Date. The Company anticipates extending the Expiration Date until such time that the Mr. Cooper Acquisition may be consummated substantially concurrently with the Settlement Date. Any Notes validly tendered and related Consents validly delivered after the Early Tender Deadline (including during any extension of the Expiration Date) may not be withdrawn, except as required by law. No tenders submitted after the Expiration Date will be valid.\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations, holders of the Early Tender Notes will receive the Total Tender Offer Consideration set forth in the table above, which includes the Early Tender Payment set forth in the table above. Holders of Notes tendering their Notes after the Early Tender Deadline and on or prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration set forth in the table above, which is the Total Tender Offer Consideration less the Early Tender Payment. In addition, holders of all Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the last interest payment date with respect to such Notes to, but excluding, the Settlement Date.\n\nThe terms and conditions of the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations are described in an Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated August 4, 2025 (the \"Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement\"). The consummation of the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations for the Notes of any series are subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, including, among other things, the substantially concurrent consummation of the acquisition of Mr. Cooper on terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 31, 2025 (as it may be amended from time to time, the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among the Company, Maverick Merger Sub, Inc., Maverick Merger Sub 2, LLC, and Mr. Cooper.\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security. No offer, solicitation, or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is the dealer manager and solicitation agent (the \"Dealer Manager\") for the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations. D.F. King & Co., Inc. has been retained to serve as both the depositary and the information agent (the \"Depositary and Information Agent\") for the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations.

King & Co., Inc. at RKT@dfking.com (email), (800) 549-6864 (U.S. Toll-Free) or (212) 390-0450 (Banks and Brokers).\n\nNone of Rocket Companies, its board of directors, Mr. Cooper and each of Mr. Cooper's direct and indirect domestic, wholly owned subsidiaries that are issuers or guarantors under the Notes, Nationstar, Rocket Mortgage, LLC (\"Rocket Mortgage\"), each of Rocket Mortgage's direct and indirect domestic, wholly owned subsidiaries that are issuers or guarantors under Rocket Mortgage's existing senior notes and Redfin Corporation, the Dealer Manager, the Depositary and Information Agent, the Trustee under each Indenture, or any of their affiliates, makes any recommendation as to whether holders of the Notes should tender any Notes in response to the Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations.
