      "summary": "China is advancing the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, expanding its capacity and securing additional routes, which undermines President Trump’s goal of establishing U.S. energy dominance. The move also includes a concession to a U.S.-sanctioned Arctic LNG cargo, further eroding U.S. export advantages. These developments highlight China’s growing economic and geopolitical influence in global energy markets, posing a strategic challenge to U.S. energy policy.",
