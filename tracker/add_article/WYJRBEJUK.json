      "summary": "Washington is proposing a 75‑foot forest buffer rule for 19,000 miles of Type Np streams to keep water cool for salmon, orcas, and downstream ecosystems. The rule, grounded in two decades of science and the state’s Adaptive Management Program, would reduce forestland values by $11–35 million but is argued to deliver far greater ecological and cultural benefits. Timber companies oppose the rule, citing profit losses, while conservation groups emphasize the rule’s role in climate resilience and habitat protection. Public comment closed on Aug. 12, and the rule’s passage would mark a significant update to the 1999 Forest & Fish Law. ",
