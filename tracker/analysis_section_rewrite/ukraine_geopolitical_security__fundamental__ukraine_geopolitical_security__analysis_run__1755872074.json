      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid overview of the geopolitical landscape surrounding the upcoming Trump-Putin summit, but it lacks depth in causal reasoning and specificity regarding market implications. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, consider the following actionable edits: \n\n1. **Enhance Depth and Clarity**: Expand on the causal chain linking military dynamics to market reactions. For example, elaborate on how specific military developments (e.g., drone attacks) directly impact investor sentiment and energy prices.\n\n2. **First-Principles Grounding**: Integrate first-principles analysis by discussing the economic fundamentals driving the conflict, such as energy dependencies and trade relationships, to provide a clearer context for market transmission.\n\n3. **Scenario Structure**: Develop distinct scenarios for potential outcomes of the summit (e.g., successful ceasefire, continued conflict) and their respective market implications, including quantifiable ranges for market reactions based on historical precedents.\n\n4. **Specificity of Catalysts**: Identify specific catalysts or triggers that could influence market movements post-summit, such as changes in military aid or shifts in European policy, and articulate how these could affect investor behavior.\n\n5. **Quantification**: Use more precise numbers and ranges where possible, especially regarding economic impacts, to avoid generalities. For instance, specify how much military aid could be affected by U.S. policy shifts.\n\n6. **Citation Density**: Ensure that all claims are backed by appropriate citations from the provided sources, and reconcile any conflicting information to present a cohesive narrative.\n\nBy addressing these points, the analysis will not only gain in clarity and coherence but also provide actionable insights for investors navigating this complex geopolitical landscape.",
