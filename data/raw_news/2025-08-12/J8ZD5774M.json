  "description": "Key PointsPresident Trump has suggested semiconductors and microchips imported into the United States could be subject to a 100% tariff.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None President Trump has suggested semiconductors and microchips imported into the United States could be subject to a 100% tariff.\n\u2022 None Apple will largely be exempt from these tariff costs by virtue of its investment in American technological manufacturing.\n\u2022 None The absence of steep tariffs and its regrouped artificial intelligence business make Apple an even better investment prospect.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Apple \u203a\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shareholders are still celebrating last week's unexpected turn of events in Washington, D.C. After months of worries over ever-costlier tariffs on imported goods -- including its all-important iPhone -- Apple is now (mostly) off the hook. The White House announced on Wednesday that in exchange for an additional $100 billion worth of investment in American manufacturing of the tech used in its devices, Apple would be exempt from the 100% import tariff President Donald Trump has recently threatened for any semiconductors shipped into the United States.\n\nThe specifics of the exemption and Apple's plans still aren't clear, nor is it clear they ever will be. Apple also seemingly made the investment decision independent of President Trump's involvement, yet Apple CEO Tim Cook was still present when the president made the announcement from the White House on Wednesday. The president only explained of the newly proposed chip and semiconductor tariff that \"the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.\"\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that Apple and its shareholders are better off with Tim Cook working with the U.S. president than they are by working around him.\n\nIf it seems like President Trump's tariffs are forever changing, you're not imagining things. They are. He's maneuvering in response to companies' efforts to sidestep his previously imposed tariffs. For instance, after February's announcement of an additional 10% import tariff on goods made in China -- where most iPhones are still assembled -- was eventually pumped up to 54%, Apple soon began working to shift more iPhone production to India.\n\nTrump countered in April with an additional 26% tariff on goods exported from India to the United States, and in May specifically threatened a 25% tariff on U.S. iPhones regardless of where they were manufactured. In the meantime, in response to the country's continued purchases of crude oil from Russia, the White House has punitively imposed an additional 25% tariff on all of India's goods imported into the United States.\n\nIt seems Apple, however, will be sidestepping at least a significant chunk of these additional costs. By agreeing to raise its previous investment commitment in American manufacturing of technological components from $500 billion to $600 billion, Trump says Apple isn't subject to the 100% import tariff on semiconductors that other chip companies like Intel could soon be paying. Although the time frame isn't necessarily linked to the exemption, Apple says this investment will be deployed over the course of the coming four years, positively impacting 79 U.S. factories managed by 10 manufacturing partners including Corning, Texas Instruments, and Broadcom, just to name a few.\n\nArguably of most interest to Trump is the fact that Apple's so-called American Manufacturing Program should support as many as 450,000 domestic jobs.\n\nWhat it means for Apple shareholders\n\nThere is no executive order yet declaring Apple or any other outfit exempt from any of Trump's tariffs, for the record -- only the president's spoken statements at Wednesday's press conference, which didn't clarify if the entirety of an imported iPhone is exempt, or only the value of the chips and semiconductors found inside it. There's also no clarity as to how microchips made within the United States that are shipped to overseas assemblers that then ship completed products back to the U.S. will be handled. As such, take all of it with a grain of salt.\n\nEven without such details, though, Apple has scored a couple of respectable wins here.\n\nOne of these wins is very specific: a reduction in the amount of tariffs it's been paying of late. The company reported $800 million in tariff costs for the quarter ending in June in the shadow of recent tariff hikes, and predicted $1.1 billion worth of tariff expenses for the three-month stretch set to end in September. For perspective, Apple turned $94 billion worth of revenue into net income of $23.4 billion in what was a relatively typical June quarter, and is expected to report a top line of $101.5 billon for the quarter currently underway. Although not all of this total import cost is going away, presumably a sizable chunk of it will be. Apple should be at least slightly more profitable thanks to this recent development, although not by leaps and bounds.\n\nThe bigger win here is a purely subjective but incredibly important one. By giving the president a highly visible win of his own as well as a key talking point he can now leverage, Apple and its CEO Tim Cook are back in Donald Trump's good graces. More to the point, by virtue of being a high-profile American company that Trump now wants -- and even needs -- to thrive, it's likely that the president will largely leave Apple out of the crosshairs of future tariffs and executive orders.\n\nBut is this reason enough to buy Apple stock?\n\nTruth be told, while all the newly introduced tariffs were highly criticized and created a great deal of investor angst, they were never a reason not to own Apple shares. Oh, they're certainly a cost. There's also no denying Apple was caught in the middle of what was ultimately a complicated geopolitical battle between a handful of industrialized countries' leaders. These tariffs were never an existential threat to the company, however. Last quarter's 13% year-over-year improvement in iPhone revenue against a tariff-laden backdrop says as much.\n\nStill, to the extent tariff worries were holding an otherwise bullish Apple stock back, that ceiling is no longer in place. The bullish argument is even stronger now. That's particularly true given the company's regrouped artificial intelligence efforts. It expects much of this consumer-facing tech to be of true Apple caliber by next year, including an upgraded version of Siri, AI-enabled glasses, and some of the anticipated features of Apple Intelligence that were missing when the platform was first launched in October of last year.\n\nAnd the underlying opportunity is big to be sure. All told, Global Insight Services expects this consumer-facing sliver of the artificial intelligence market to grow at an average annual pace of 22% through 2034. Apple's powerful brand name along with its new and improved AI tech position it to win more than its fair share of this market's growth. The tariff exemption only makes doing so even easier.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,119,863!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Semiconductor stocks are shares of companies that produce the microchips and electronic components used in everything from smartphones to cars.\nThey are part of the technology sector but are also manufacturing businesses, which means their businesses are cyclical, like any industrial business.\nSemiconductor\nPicking top-performing semiconductor stocks in the industry can be tricky, and their performance is highly volatile since sales volumes ebb and flow.\nBut the semiconductor sector is growing rapidly as the world rapidly embraces its critical role in artificial intelligence (AI) development and applications.\nSome of the best-performing stocks throughout 2023-25, like Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%), have hailed from the semiconductor industry.\nDifferent types of semiconductor stocks\nDifferent types of semiconductor stocks\nThe Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), a system used by investors and index providers to categorize public companies by sector and industry group, places semiconductor stocks under the information technology sector. Within this sector, GICS breaks down semiconductor-related firms into two main categories.\nSemiconductor equipment\nThese companies provide the tools, machines, and services required to manufacture chips. This includes firms that make lithography systems, wafer inspection tools, or etching equipment used by chipmakers. These companies tend to be critical suppliers for the production process, but don\u2019t produce chips themselves.\nSemiconductor companies\nThese are the ones that actually design and manufacture the chips that power computers, smartphones, cars, appliances, and more. These chips can range from basic memory to high-performance processors or specialized sensors.\nOther classification methods\nBeyond this GICS classification, semiconductor stocks can also be sorted by geography, such as U.S.-based versus international companies, or by business model.\nSome are fabless, meaning they design chips but outsource the manufacturing to third-party foundries. Others operate fabs, or fabrication plants, and handle the manufacturing process in-house.\nEach of these distinctions can affect how the company earns revenue, manages costs, and scales operations.\nTrends\nWhat trends drive semiconductor stocks?\nComputer chips have many uses, but up-and-coming semiconductor companies will likely focus on two areas of growth in the decade ahead:\n1. The Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data with each other.\nThis technology is set to revolutionize various industries by enabling smarter homes, cities, and consumer goods.\nSemiconductors are crucial in IoT devices since they provide the processing power and connectivity needed for these devices to function.\nAs IoT applications expand, the demand for advanced, energy-efficient chips that can handle the diverse and high-volume data processing requirements will surge.\nEmerging semiconductor companies focusing on IoT will need to innovate to create smaller, more efficient, and more powerful chips to meet the evolving needs of this market.\n2. Generative AI\nGenerative AI, which includes technologies like machine learning and neural networks, is another significant growth driver for semiconductor companies.\nThese AI systems require immense computational power to process complex algorithms and vast amounts of data.\nAs generative AI becomes more integrated into applications such as search engines, autonomous vehicles, and advanced robotics, the demand for high-performance chips will increase.\nSemiconductor companies that develop graphics processing units (GPUs) and other specialized AI hardware are poised to benefit immensely from this trend. Innovations in chip architecture to improve speed, efficiency, and processing capabilities will be essential to support the growing AI industry.\nAnother important long-term catalyst to watch in the U.S. is the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in August 2022. The legislation was designed to significantly bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research via billions in funding and significant tax credits.\nSemiconductor stocks\nBest semiconductor stocks to buy in 2025\nHere are two top picks for semiconductor industry secular growth trends:\n1. Qualcomm\nQualcomm (QCOM 0.28%) is the longtime leader in mobile chip design. Historically, Qualcomm has been a key Apple (AAPL -0.92%) supplier, having profited from the smartphone boom and Apple's ecosystem over the past decade.\nRecently launched flagship Android devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 are seeing strong demand globally, especially in China.\nIn premium and high-tier smartphones, Qualcomm's Snapdragon Mobile platforms are also enabling generative AI capabilities.\nToday, Qualcomm has also pivoted to a strong automotive focus via its Snapdragon X platforms. These platforms aim to transform vehicles with advanced connectivity and autonomous driving features.\nIn the PC market, Qualcomm has expanded its computer portfolio with the Snapdragon X Plus Platform, tailored towards upcoming launches of next-generation AI PCs.\n2. Nvidia\nNvidia (NVDA -0.44%) has positioned itself as the platform for all types of AI, largely thanks to its portfolio and the powerful H100 Tensor Core GPU, putting it in a leading position to pursue new markets and expand revenue.\nIn 2024, Nvidia clocked new revenue records, driven largely by growth in their data center segment, which CEO Jensen Huang terms \"AI factories.\"\nHuang believes AI is increasingly becoming a commodity, and these AI factories are pivotal in accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference. They are essential for consumer internet companies, automotive industries, healthcare sectors, and many other fields that require complex infrastructure to run their models on.\nBeyond their GPUs and data centers, Nvidia also offers a variety of platforms to cater to the evolving AI landscape. Blackwell, for instance, is designed for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X is a new market offering aimed at scaling AI to Ethernet-only data centers.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's NIM (Nvidia Infrastructure Management) is a software solution that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI capable of running on CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) everywhere.\nCUDA is Nvidia's parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model, which allows developers to utilize Nvidia GPUs for general-purpose processing (an approach known as GPGPU, general purpose computing on graphics processing units).\nSemiconductor ETFs\nBest semiconductor ETFs to buy right now\nIf you prefer not to pick single stocks, you can also buy a semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ETF) to gain exposure to the overall sector\nTwo top semiconductor ETFs in terms of overall assets under management (AUM) are:\n1. iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX -0.23%) tracks 30 market cap-weighted U.S. semiconductor stocks via the NYSE Semiconductor index. This ETF sported more than $13 billion in assets under management (AUM) in mid-2025, charging a 0.35% expense ratio.\n2. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH -0.11%) tracks 25 market cap-weighted, U.S.-listed semiconductor stocks via the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 index. It had more than $26 billion in assets in mid-2025 and charged a 0.35% expense ratio.\nKey factors\nKey factors to understand before investing in semiconductors\nWhen looking for the best chipmakers and long-term undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy, consider these four key factors before you buy:\n1. Sustainable revenue growth\nCompanies that gradually increase their sales over time are the best investments, but overall revenue growth matters even more for semiconductor stocks.\nRevenue\nMany companies in this sector struggle to cope with the industry's cyclical nature. Hardware, such as PC and laptop chips, tends to become a commodity as the years progress and more advanced chips come out. If a new market is growing quickly, other chipmakers might pile on with similar products. Supply swells, prices fall, and individual company sales decline.\nIf a semiconductor chip company isn't constantly innovating and finding new outlets or developing a robust pipeline for its hardware tech, weathering the cycle can be unsustainable.\nThat being said, some chip designers are able to protect their work with patents that are not easy to replicate by other means. This can create a type of competitive moat for the company's long-term growth, although it doesn't completely prevent up-and-down sales cycles.\n2. Above-average profit margins\nSales need to translate to profits. Companies that cannot control their expenses have low profit margins, and companies with high profit margins have a greater ability to reinvest in research and improve their operations. High gross profit, operating profit, and free cash flow generation are also positive indicators that the company is operating efficiently.\nBecause of the very high amount of expense needed to get into the semiconductor business, established companies tend to be able to ramp up profit margins as revenue increases over time.\n3. Attractive returns on invested capital\nA company's return on invested capital (ROIC) indicates how well it's able to generate profit from the cash it raises via debt and equity it receives. A high ROIC means the company is likely innovating strategically, improving operations to increase efficiency, and targeting secular growth trends with new chip designs.\n4. Strong balance sheet\nSemiconductors are arguably the most complex things ever developed by humankind. Manufacturing chips is very expensive, so it's especially important to understand how semiconductor companies obtain the necessary financial resources to expand.\nFor example, take chip manufacturers such as the world's largest, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.0%). For a chip business, the company has above-average debt compared to its revenue. However, it also has more cash and investments than it does debt, which signifies a healthy and profitable business that has no problems getting funding.\nA company's balance sheet that has more cash than debt and low debt relative to operating profit is a key element to watch. Plenty of cash relative to debt means that a company is well positioned to pay interest and principal payments, even in a pinch. It can also mean the return of excess cash in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.\nRelated investing topics\nFAQ\nFAQ: Best semiconductor investments\nWhat stock is the best for semiconductors?\nThe best stock depends on your investment objectives and risk tolerance, but Nvidia was one of the best-performing and largest semiconductor stocks in 2025.\nWhat is the best chip stock to buy?\nThe best chip stock depends on your targeted market (e.g., smartphones, PCs, data centers, gaming, etc.). For general exposure, a large company like Nvidia will provide broad coverage.\nAre semiconductors a good investment?\nSemiconductors can be a good investment, offering strong returns but also experiencing high volatility.

      "text": "The technology sector is vast, comprising gadget makers, software developers, wireless providers, streaming services, semiconductor companies, and cloud computing providers, to name just a few. Any company that sells a product or service heavily infused with technology likely belongs to the tech sector.\nWhat are tech stocks?\nWhat are tech stocks?\nHardware Companies\nThese design and build devices such as:\n- Personal computers\n- Networking servers\n- Semiconductors\n- Smartphones\n- Fitness trackers\n- Smart speakers\n- Enterprise equipment, such as servers and networking gear\nSoftware Companies\nThese design the software that runs on hardware, such as:\n- Operating systems\n- Databases\n- Cybersecurity software\n- Productivity software\n- Cloud computing providers\n- Artificial intelligence (AI)\nSoftware companies are increasingly moving to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model in which customers buy a subscription to a program instead of a one-time license. The arrangement generates recurring revenue for the software company.\nSemiconductor chips largely power the hardware. Semiconductor companies design and/or manufacture central processing units, graphics processing units (GPUs), memory chips, and a wide variety of other chips that help to run today's devices.\nTelecom companies that provide wireless services support the tech sector, but actually belong to the communications sector; so do the video streaming companies that provide easy access to high-quality content, and the cloud computing providers that power those streaming services.\nOur list of stocks\nThe best tech stocks in 2025\nMany of the most valuable companies in the world are technology companies. Here are three of the most dominant and largest tech stocks that investors should consider:\nMicrosoft (MSFT -0.16%) is a dominant software company known for its Windows PC operating system and Office productivity software. Microsoft is also the second-largest provider of cloud infrastructure.\nApple (AAPL -0.92%) makes the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. Intense customer loyalty ensures plenty of repeat customers, and a growing array of services makes Apple's ecosystem sticky.\nNvidia (NVDA -0.44%) is the premier manufacturer of semiconductors and advanced GPUs critical for not only gaming, but also for AI applications.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are not technically tech stocks, despite often being lumped in with them.\nThese stocks actually belong to the communications (Meta and Alphabet) and consumer discretionary sectors (Amazon), despite their tech-heavy products and services.\nThe current market\nTech stocks in the current market\nTechnology stocks, as tracked by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK -0.68%), which follows S&P 500 technology stocks, have strongly outperformed over the past five years.\nWhile market conditions had favored high-beta assets like tech stocks, which enjoyed magnified returns in the generally bullish market environment, the market turned bearish in early 2025. Through the first two months of the year, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 dipped 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.\nSeveral macroeconomic factors have contributed to this underperformance. Inflation appears to be cooling, but consumer spending waned at the start of 2025, a sign that many interpret as a harbinger of a market downturn.\nDuring times like these, growth stocks, including technology companies, become less appealing to investors, who instead turn to more conservative options such as stocks in the utilities and consumer staples sectors.\nDespite the recent underperformance of the tech sector, the market remains keenly focused on tech stocks that have a focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Multiple companies have committed to accelerating their AI spend or are in the process of commercializing more AI products. Here are a few highlights:\n- Nvidia: Nvidia has seen massive increases in quarterly revenue, largely driven by data center revenue for generative AI training and inference. In the fourth quarter of 2025, for example, Nvidia reported record quarterly data center revenue of $35.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of 93%. Nvidia's GPUs are at the forefront of the AI revolution, making it a key player in the tech sector.\n- Microsoft: Microsoft has reported double-digit growth in revenue, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (EPS). This growth is largely attributed to the integration and use of AI in its products, such as Copilot which is driving stronger AI integration and increased usage of Microsoft Cloud, including Azure and Intelligent Cloud. Microsoft returned $9.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n- Apple: In February 2025, Apple announced its plan to spend $500 billion developing projects located in the United States over the next four years, including development of an advanced manufacturing facility in Houston. Expected to open in 2026, the Houston facility will produce servers that support the company's AI initiative, Apple Intelligence.\nRelated investing topics\nAnalyzing tech stocks\nHow to analyze tech stocks\nFor mature tech companies that produce profits, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric. Divide stock price by per-share earnings, and you get a multiple that tells you how highly the market values the company's current earnings. The higher the multiple, the more value the market is placing on future earnings growth.\nMany tech companies aren't profitable, so the price-to-earnings ratio isn't a good metric to evaluate them. Revenue growth matters more for younger companies. If you're investing in something unproven, you want to make sure it has solid growth prospects.\nFor unprofitable tech companies, it's also important that the bottom line be moving from losses toward profits. As a company grows, it should become more efficient, especially when it comes to the sales and marketing spending necessary to close deals. If it's not, or if spending is growing as a percentage of revenue, that could indicate something is wrong.\nUltimately, a good tech stock is one that trades at a reasonable valuation, given its growth prospects. Accurately figuring out those growth prospects is the hard part. If you expect earnings to skyrocket in the coming years, paying a premium for the stock can make sense. But if you're wrong about those growth prospects, your investment may not work out.\nInvesting in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on tech stocks is one way to avoid making mistakes. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM -0.54%) is a comprehensive option at a 0.41% expense ratio.\nInvesting in tech stocks can be risky, but you can reduce your risk by investing only when you feel confident their growth prospects justify their valuations."

      "text": "Computers excel at crunching numbers but not at the things that many people do with ease, like language processing, visual perception, object manipulation, reasoning, planning, and learning. Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language generation and facial recognition.\nHow do companies use AI?\nHow do companies use artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is created through machine learning, which involves training a system with a tremendous amount of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about new data it's never seen.\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.\nCompanies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants. AI is used by Alphabet subsidiary (GOOGL -0.27%) (GOOG -0.3%) Google to filter spam in Gmail, by Amazon (AMZN -0.7%) to recommend products to customers, and by Netflix (NFLX 0.57%) to guide content creation and recommendations.\nMore recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far generative AI -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams. It has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic's Claude, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta AI from Meta Platforms (META -0.49%). The potential is enormous.\nThe next frontier for generative AI is AI agents or agentic AI. This is technology allows AI to perform to complete whole tasks without being prompted, such as automated customer service agents. AgentForce from Salesforce (CRM -3.51%) is one example of a new agentic AI tool.\nGenerative AI\nSome companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | AI Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Data center GPUs and superchips. |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Generative AI and self-driving cars. |\n| Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Memory chips for data centers and generative AI tools. |\n| CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) | Generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure platform. |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | AI chatbots, LLMs, and wearable devices. |\n1. Nvidia\nLeading graphics processing unit (GPU) company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI's training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, typically requires less. GPU chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia's ambitions have gone beyond GPUs, as the company now aims to build AI factories or data centers full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.\nNvidia's data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company's revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI. Revenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well. It's become the most valuable company in the world on several occasions and was No. 1 in mid-2025. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand.\nIts chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like large language models require. The pure-play chip stock is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.\nSelf-driving cars and \"physical AI\" are other areas of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company's revenue, but that could change.\nWith Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) launching its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.\nA self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia's platform delivers.\nIts professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has potential in AI. Nvidia's chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It's also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities including San Francisco and Phoenix.\nAlphabet launched Gemini, its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT, which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown as Alphabet's ad revenue continues to grow steadily. It said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\"\nWith information at the heart of its business, it's unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It's rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.\nAI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it.\nFinally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft has gotten lots of buzz lately thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.\nMicrosoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.\nCEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform, and the reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of the company's conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind as it did with mobile.\nMore recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI, adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including DeepSeek's R1. The long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it's wise to hedge its bets in the AI race.\nMicrosoft is also harnessing the power of AI in other ways, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It's also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools.\nThe company launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, which allows its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.\n4. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave, which had its initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it was the first major AI IPO.\nIts cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base; Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.\nCoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost nothing in revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024. Between 2022 and 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.\nCoreWeave's business is risky since Microsoft accounted for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft pulled back on spending with the platform. In its first quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.\nIf you're looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by the demand for computing power to run generative AI programs. However, the stock is risky since CoreWeave has a high debt burden, has large capital expenditures, and is deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP).\n5. Meta Platforms\nUnlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn't have a cloud computing business, but the company is investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet.\nMeta AI, the company's chatbot that's available on its apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, now has 1 billion monthly active users as of May, and it continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.\nIt's also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is also involved in ad targeting, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through those headsets.\nManagement sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas like advertising, experiences, and devices.\nMachine learning stocks\nMachine learning stocks\nAll the stocks above use machine learning technologies, but if you're looking for more options, here are two others worth considering:\n- Palantir (PLTR -2.27%): Palantir has been one of the top-performing AI stocks. The company provides cloud software and specializes in data fusion that helps its customers make important insights by connecting disparate pieces of information hidden in data. It also launched its AI Platform (AIP) in 2023, which has helped accelerate its growth. Palantir deploys machine learning models on top of data foundations and continuously improves them to ensure that they become more useful.\n- Tesla: Best known for its electric vehicles, CEO Elon Musk sees AI as the future of the company, and machine learning and neural networks are very much at the center of the company's autonomous vehicle and Optimus autonomous robot projects. Tesla introduced its driverless Cybercab in October 2024, and the company hopes to begin producing the vehicles by 2026. It launched its robotaxi network in June, though with just a handful of vehicles, and Musk envisions the company expanding to other cities in the near future. Musk has said Tesla's automation technology could make it the most valuable company in the world.\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It's the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn't require human input.\nNvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.\nAlphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\nRelated investing topics\nA growth business\nAI is a growth business\nAccording to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028.\nWhile the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.\nFAQ\nArtificial intelligence stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best AI stock to buy?\nArtificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.\nIs it good to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The semiconductor sector can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly. Additionally, there's the potential for unexpected surprises like the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.\nWhat is the biggest AI company?\nCurrently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a market cap that has soared past $3 trillion. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution as its components are fueling AI applications and are in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.\nIs AI good for investing?\nArtificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.\nWhat company is No. 1 in AI?\nCurrently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn't guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.\nWill AI start-ups challenge tech giants?\nTech giants aren't feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.\nThe tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth."
