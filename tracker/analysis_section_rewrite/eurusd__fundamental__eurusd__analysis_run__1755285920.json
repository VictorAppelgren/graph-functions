      "feedback": "The article is too long and disjointed for the SlashGear style. Trim the opening to a 1‑sentence hook (“In temperate climates all‑season tires may suffice, but in snowy regions a dedicated winter set is essential.”). Merge the body into a single 2‑paragraph block (≈200‑250 words): first paragraph should explain the key differences between winter and all‑season tires, then briefly describe Toyo’s walnut‑shell compound and its benefits (high friction, no road damage). End with a concise 1‑sentence conclusion (“Choosing the right tire type depends on your local winter severity and vehicle drivetrain.”). Remove the lengthy scraped‑source excerpt, redundant “What about all‑weather tires?” section, and any repeated phrases. Keep the title, categories, and keywords unchanged. This will bring the piece into the 200‑300‑word range with a clear intro, single‑paragraph body, and short conclusion.",
