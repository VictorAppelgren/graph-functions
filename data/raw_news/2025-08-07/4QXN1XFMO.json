  "description": "With Walmart Deals of the Day, you can also score the Vizio 65-inch 4K-Series TV for $80 off and the Beats Solo 4 headphones for $70 less.",
  "content": "Some no-brainer tech upgrades just dropped in price at Walmart. The Vizio 65-inch 4K-Series TV is now $80 off and ready for your weekend binge with low input lag and decent color that holds up great for casual shows or gaming. The Beats Solo 4 knock $70 off the price while giving you hands-free Siri, wired or wireless listening, and punchy sound that\u2019s easy to enjoy all day. And the JBL Flip 7, now 20% off, is the rugged, go-anywhere speaker that sounds better than it has any right to at this size.\n\nIf these deals didn't catch your eye, take some time to check out the ones we found on and .\n\nAfter a budget-friendly 4K TV in the 65-inch range? Then point your eyes toward this Vizio 4K-Series with an $80 price cut. With decent picture quality, it handles SDR colors fairly accurately and has impressively low input lag, which makes it surprisingly responsive for gaming. Our expert, , rated it \"Good\" in for its brilliant performance at this particular price point. It's a reliable option for basic use, though its dim display and limited color range mean it's best for casual viewing rather than cinematic experiences.\n\n\u201cWith the signature Beats sound, fairly long battery life, and hands-free Siri, the Beats Solo 4 headphones are an evolution of a mostly successful formula,\u201d says our audio expert, , who rated them \u201cGood\u201d in . The physical buttons on the earcups are straightforward and let you skip tracks without fumbling around with your phone. You can listen in wired mode over USB-C or 3.5mm, so battery life isn\u2019t a worry. And if you have an Apple device, hands-free Siri access makes tasks like texting or adjusting volume feel effortless. Overall, they\u2019re a choice for daily listening and, at a $70 discount, an easier option to consider.\n\nThe latest JBL Flip 7 is super portable, currently available for a 20% discount, and handles drops and pool splashes like a champ. As tester put it, \u201cIt's designed to be used on the move and sounds good for its size.\u201d He gave it a Good rating in , and it\u2019s a solid pick. The bass hits hard enough for casual listening, and the battery easily lasts through a long hangout or hike. Want more juice? Flip on Playtime Boost to stretch the runtime. It syncs effortlessly with other JBL speakers using Auracast too.\n\nThere are even today. So go ahead and save now!",
