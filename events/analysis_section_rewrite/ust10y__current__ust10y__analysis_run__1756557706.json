      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist for the draft:**\n\n1. **Remove all non‑asset content** – delete the paragraph(s) about Porsche’s CEO search, the Tesla cyber‑truck lawsuit, and the Cracker Barrel re‑branding. These do not link to the UST 10‑year or its transmission path and violate the “no micro‑local” rule.  \n2. **Anchor every claim to a source** – add inline citations (e.g., (97MD1FHW8), (U21K4ALYQ), (1DEM6P1Y2)) after each factual statement.  \n3. **Map to canonical handle** – explicitly state “UST 10‑year yield (ust10y)” whenever you reference the instrument.  \n4. **Quantify directional moves** – replace vague “10‑20 bps” with a clear range (e.g., “10–20 bps decline if a 25‑bp Fed cut materialises”).  \n5. **Define catalyst windows** – list the exact dates: Aug 12 PCE release, Sept 16‑17 FOMC, any tariff‑policy announcements (mid‑Oct).  \n6. **State thresholds** – add a bullet: “4.20 % → hawkish; 4.00 % → dovish consensus.”  \n7. **Specify invalidation conditions** – “If core PCE > 2.9 % or tariffs expand, ust10y could rise to 4.30‑4.35 %.”  \n8. **Add monitoring signals** – “Watch Fed‑funds futures, 10‑yr Treasury futures, and the 10‑yr/2‑yr spread for early shifts.”  \n9. **Trim tech‑earnings discussion** – keep only the net effect on risk‑premium (e.g., “Marvell/Dell weakness compresses equity risk‑premium, slightly easing the yield curve but outweighed by inflation data”).  \n10. **Maintain 0–3‑week horizon** – keep all dates within the next 21 days and remove any longer‑term speculation.  \n\nAfter these edits, the paragraph will be concise, evidence‑driven, and fully aligned with the Argos standards.",
