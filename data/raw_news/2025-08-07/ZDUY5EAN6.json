  "description": "Seattle startup Wild Zebra is piloting a personalized AI tutor in schools, guiding students through interactive conversations that build real understanding.",
  "content": "GeekWire\u2019s startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter , and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory .\n\nA new Seattle startup is building a personal AI tutor that doesn\u2019t just give the answer but guides students through lessons, adapts to how they learn, appeals to their personal interests, and grows with them over time.\n\nWild Zebra, founded by edtech veteran Edan Shahar and longtime AI technologist Erik Selberg, uses AI to guide students through Socratic-style interactions \u2014 drawing out their thinking through guided questioning \u2014 while adapting to their interests, learning styles, and individual needs.\n\n\u201cWe think the days of trains leaving Boston and going to Chicago are dead,\u201d said Shahar, the company\u2019s CEO, referring to stodgy word problems. He explained that any subject can be taught using topics a student is already passionate about, such as sports or pop music.\n\nOperating in stealth mode up to this point, the startup has already piloted its AI tutor in four schools, reaching more than 6,000 students with an initial focus on math and reading comprehension.\n\nThe feedback from teachers and administrators has exceeded expectations, Shahar said. Some educators have observed students becoming more focused and choosing to use the AI tutor outside of class time.\n\nBuilding on its current school-based model, Shahar said Wild Zebra also plans to launch a direct-to-consumer version for students to use at home.\n\n\u201cSo much of the conversation about AI has been around cheating,\u201d Shahar said. \u201cThe reason for that is when you go to ChatGPT and you ask it a question, you expect an answer.\u201d\n\nWhile a wave of AI-powered learning tools have flooded the market, Wild Zebra is deliberately charting a different path. Rather than delivering quick solutions, its AI engages students in multi-turn conversations, asking questions that prompt reflection and reasoning.\n\n\u201cA lot of our work is to make sure to not give away the answer,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked how Wild Zebra differentiates itself from established competitors like Khan Academy\u2019s Khanmigo, Shahar pointed to two key areas:\n\u2022 First, while he respects the broad approach of other platforms, his strategy is to \u201cstart small and really do an amazing job in a small subset\u201d before earning the right to expand.\n\u2022 Second, he emphasized a deep focus on student engagement, creating a product compelling enough to capture attention in a world dominated by services like TikTok.\n\nAs students interact with the system, the AI continually updates their learning profiles \u2014 surfacing gaps in understanding that may trace back years, while enabling more advanced learners to progress at their own pace.\n\nWild Zebra recently raised $2 million in funding to build on that early traction, expand its school partnerships, and prepare for a broader rollout. The startup has eight employees. It\u2019s not yet generating revenue. The company plans to introduce an implementation fee for schools starting in the fall of 2025 but has not yet decided on final pricing for its platform.\n\nThe idea for Wild Zebra emerged in mid-2024, after Shahar, who previously co-founded the travel-tech startup Utrip and served for nearly a decade as CEO of edtech company Test Innovators, returned from helping lead Israel\u2019s national quantum computing initiative.\n\nHe connected with Selberg \u2014 a veteran technologist whose career spans leadership roles at eBay, Grab, and Microsoft \u2014 through DocuSign co-founder Court Lorenzini, a startup advisor. Selberg, who also co-created the MetaCrawler search engine in the early days of the web, brought deep experience in large-scale AI infrastructure and machine learning systems.\n\nBehind the scenes, the system draws on multiple large language models depending on the context \u2014 a flexible, privacy-conscious architecture that Shahar said was shaped by Selberg\u2019s experience. This multi-model approach is also key to ensuring accuracy and preventing the AI from hallucinating or otherwise teaching incorrect information.\n\nSelberg has \u201cbeen working in AI since before it was cool,\u201d with a \u201cdeep understanding of what problems AI can and can\u2019t solve, and how to think about the shifting landscape,\u201d Shahar said.\n\nDelivered as a web-based application, Wild Zebra\u2019s AI tutor starts by assessing each student\u2019s skills, a process enhanced through a key partnership with the Educational Records Bureau (ERB), an investor in the company.\n\nAccess to ERB\u2019s anonymized student trajectory data helps the AI understand where a student is on their learning journey. From there, the AI guides students through conversations designed to promote reasoning rather than simply providing answers.\n\nAs students engage, the system adapts dynamically \u2014 adjusting its pace and pulling in relevant examples based on each student\u2019s preferences and interests.\n\nTeachers remain part of the loop through a dashboard that tracks student progress and flags areas where additional support may be needed. In that way, it\u2019s designed to solve what Shahar calls one of their biggest challenges: tailoring the learning experience to individual students.\n\nHe envisions the Wild Zebra AI as a virtual \u201clearning specialist sitting with each and every student.\u201d This specialist can identify whether a student is bored and needs a greater challenge or has a learning gap that needs to be filled. Those insights are then reported to the teacher\u2019s dashboard, allowing them to provide targeted small-group support where it\u2019s needed most.\n\nShahar said the startup is a watershed moment in his own journey, as well.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like everything I\u2019ve worked on in my life has led to this point \u2014 building companies, working in education, being a student myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if a lot of people get that visceral feeling, but I\u2019m getting it right now, and it\u2019s awesome.\u201d",

  "argos_summary": "Wild Zebra, a new Seattle startup co-founded by Edan Shahar and Erik Selberg, is developing a personal AI tutor that engages students through Socratic-style questioning and adapts to their individual learning styles and interests. The AI tutor has already been piloted in four schools, reaching over 6,000 students, with plans for a direct-to-consumer version. Recently, the startup raised $2 million in funding to expand its school partnerships and enhance its platform, which focuses on fostering critical thinking rather than simply providing answers.",
