  "title": "6 Key Success Factors For Building A Growth Unit",
  "description": "Building a new growth unit companies should apply six key success factors to help them avoid common pitfalls and accelerate performance",
  "content": "Building a Growth Unit to pursue opportunities beyond the operational core business\n\nEstablished companies often see growth opportunities but are often too slow-moving and risk-averse to capture them. It can feel like being a kid in a candy store, stopped by a parent from getting what they want. They see it, they want it, but a force they cannot control gets in the way. Unlike children, companies have a choice, they can control the forces stopping them. They can set up a Growth Unit dedicated to pursuing growth separate to the existing organization.\n\nThis is a good strategy. Though, it is also harder to execute successfully than it sounds.\n\nBased on my research with my co-authors Professor Mike Tushman from Harvard Business School and Professor Charles O\u2019Reilly from Stanford, I have refined Six Key Success Factors for setting up a corporate Growth Unit. These insights are validated by twenty-five years of practical experience, first at IBM, where I worked on the team responsible for its multi-billion-dollar \u201cemerging business opportunity\u201d program, and then advising corporate clients, large and small on five continents.\n\nI am fortunate to have been involved with many successful growth units. IBM tops the list, due to its size and the name recognition. However, there are many less well-known and smaller firms that have been super successful. This list includes the Japanese glass firm AGC, that makes over 25% of its profits from businesses set up in the past ten years; the UK-based information firm RELX, which has created new billion-dollar units and Austrian insurance firm UNIQA, that has formed a fast-growing healthcare unit, Mavie.\n\nThese are the good news stories. Then there are failure cases. These are firms whose Growth Units have closed or badly underperformed. I do not want to suggest that I\u2019ve only been associated with success. Growth projects do not always go as planned. There are \u201csilent killers\u201d that lurk inside old, established companies and will undermine progress, often unintentionally. It is hard work. Anyone who claims a 100% success rate is probably not telling you the whole story.\n\nDespite the challenges, I am confident that established firms can capture opportunities for new revenue growth outside the core business. There are six key success factors that can help bridge the gap between failure and success.\n\u2022 Building from your existing assets in selected areas, where you can win. An established firm starts with customers, capabilities, and capacities that an entrepreneur would envy. These are the building blocks for new growth.\n\nSuccessful Growth Units start by defining markets where the above assets give them a right to win. These \u201chunting zones\u201d are where successful Growth Units look for the high value customer problems they can solve. \n\nFailure cases follow a different path. They occur when new growth units gather ideas far and wide, mistaking business building for innovation. The latter makes sense only if you can tolerate the 70-90% failure rate of startup ventures. Corporations cannot play these odds.\n\u2022 Starting small, learning from experiments to refine value propositions and reduce risks. Any growth opportunity worth pursuing will have uncertainties attached to it. Investing too quickly means turning these uncertainties into risks that may later kill the project. Better to start small and to spend as little as possible to learn as much as you can. You do this by designing experiments that test your most critical assumptions about what customers want, what they will pay for, and how you can make money. \n\nDesigning and running experiments isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s a learnable skill. The real problem is to learn how to run them with discipline. Company leaders can get impatient waiting for experiments to generate answers. Growth Units feel pressure to run successful tests that confirm what they already think. \n\nHowever, a much better path is to accept the risk of spending too little and going too slowly than to overspend on unproven businesses that you\u2019ll later close.\n\u2022 Working on Scaling from Day One so that you are always aiming to build the biggest possible revenue stream. This is a big difference between building a new business inside a corporate and starting a venture-back startup. Entrepreneurs measure success based on whether they achieve an \u201cexit\u201d and ninety percent of the time that means selling a venture to a corporate. Corporations want to build revenue at a scale that matters. \n\nSuccessful corporate ventures are usually a combination of leveraging existing assets, building new ones, partnering with others, and acquiring businesses through M&A. The best way to start would be to set a long-term ambition and then work backwards to identify the assets that the ventures need to build, buy, or leverage. \n\nIn contrast, unsuccessful growth projects focus on product level success. They aim to achieve a \u201cproduct-market\u201d fit and hope someone knows how to build it into a billion-dollar-business. If your ambition is big, you need to start asking this question early.\n\u2022 Creating an \u201cexplore management system\u201d that holds the Growth Unit accountable for performance, but using metrics that are different from those in an operational unit. A regular unit uses KPIs that compare current results with past performance. Growth Units do not have data on past performance so that makes no sense. \n\nUsing revenue goals too early can be counterproductive, because it forces teams to deliver to a smaller target, not stretch for the larger opportunity. An \u201cexplore management system\u201d tracks a new business\u2019s performance against its learning goals \u2013 i.e., how many critical assumptions have been validated or disproved. This allows \u201cmilestone-based funding\u201d so that resources are released based on progress, not annual plans. This system also forces the Growth Unit\u2019s ability to make evidence-based decisions. \n\nCorporate growth projects break down when there is no way to assess its progress toward an agreed goal. It makes the Growth Unit easy prey for finance managers seeking to hit quarterly profitability goals. If there is no performance data, it is easy to argue that the project is a waste of money.\n\u2022 Designing targeted linkages for the new team to optimize its relationship with the \u201cmother ship.\u201d A Growth Unit is not an island. Yes, it needs its own resources and ability to operate independently, just like a startup. \n\nHowever, if the Growth Unit intends to use existing assets, then it also needs connection to the legacy business. These connections may include mechanisms for sharing resources, even team members; they also keep leaders in the legacy business involved with decision-making. \n\nThis is especially true if you intend to \u201cgraduate\u201d a new business back into an existing unit. The receiving unit does not have decision rights on the strategic choices of the new business, but they do deserve to be included.\n\u2022 Incubating new capabilities within core business. Many organizations aspire to promote new growth by energizing the innovation process in the core business. \n\nSome even resist creating separate growth units on the assumption that a \u201cculture of innovation\u201d by itself will transform the entire business. That\u2019s a worthy aspiration, but in real life, it often remains just that, an aspiration. \n\nIn my experience, it\u2019s growth units that not only create new businesses, but also drive the culture of innovation\u2014and this is what strengthens the bond between the growth and core units.\n\nThis only works if you resist the temptation to outsource the creation of growth units to consultants and \u201cbusiness building firms.\u201d Doing so will stop organizations from building their own capabilities. The legacy leaders and employees need \u201cskin in the game\u201d and benefit from learning new ways of working. Building new businesses is not a spectator sport. Leaders need to be actively engaged from day one, leading and driving a growth project forward.\n\nThe Key Success Factors for building a Growth Unit that I described come from my hands-on experience working with corporations to generate new revenue. I have worked with firms that were frustrated looking into the candy store, unable to reach the shelves, and buy the delights before them. They made the decision to take charge and set up a Growth Unit to pursue hard-to-reach opportunities. These firms realized that they are not as helpless as the kid in the candy store. They just needed to find a different way to get what they wanted.",

      "text": "Long-Term Management StrategyVision 2030\nIn February 2021, we announced a new long-term management strategy, Vision 2030. Our goals under this strategy are to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society and achieve continuous growth and evolution as an excellent company by providing unique materials and solutions. To realize our Vision 2030, we will create economic value through the creation of social value to achieve a spiral of enhanced corporate value by transforming our business portfolio to one that is resilient to market fluctuations and that has high asset efficiency, growth potential and carbon efficiency by promoting \u201cambidextrous management\u201d with core and strategic businesses playing an integral role.\nVision 2030\n- Q1. What are your financial targets under the Vision 2030 long-term management strategy?\n- A1. We have set the following targets as a framework for our efforts to create economic value.\nOur goals under this vision were to achieve operating profit of 300 billion yen or more (record profits) by 2030, and to maintain ROE consistently at 10% or higher.\n- Q2. Please outline your policies on business portfolio transformation as the cornerstone of your strategy.\n- A2. We will develop an \u201cambidextrous\u201d approach to management based on the deepening of core businesses and the further exploration of strategic business areas.\nIn the strategic businesses, which are very resilient to market fluctuations and have high asset and carbon efficiency, the AGC Group has revised the definition of the strategic business and incorporated Performance Chemicals, which provides high-performance materials for a variety of cutting-edge applications, as part of our strategic businesses. Also, for Mobility, another of our strategic businesses, the AGC Group has incorporated high value-added products for CASE applications, which were previously included in the core Automotive business.\n\u201cAmbidextrous\u201d management in the AGC Group\nThrough the initiatives described above in strategic and core businesses, the AGC Group aims to further enhance carbon and asset efficiency.\n- Q3. What are your policies on addressing climate change as part of sustainability management?\n- A3. We aim to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from our business operations, while also contributing to the achievement of social net-zero emissions by society.\nAs part of our contribution to the realization of a sustainable global environment, we have set a new goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions in 2050. As milestones, by 2030, we have set a goal of a 30% reduction in GHG emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2, a 50% reduction in GHG emissions per unit of sales* (both compared to 2019), and a further 30% reduction in GHG emissions in Scope 3**.\n* GHG emissions per unit of sales = GHG emissions / sales ** Total of category 1, 1, 11, and 12 of Scope 3 emissions\nAs an industry leader, AGC is working to reduce GHG emissions from manufacturing processes by introducing the world\u2019s most energy-efficient glass manufacturing technologies. While progressively and systematically implementing existing technologies, such as oxygen combustion systems and electrical boosters, we are also developing innovative technologies that will have a major impact on the future.\nWe are further expanding our contributions to the prevention of global warming through our products and technologies. In both core and strategic business areas, AGC has drawn up strategic aims for technology and business development relating to the environment and energy.\nCarbon emission targets (net-zero by 2050)\n- Q4. What human resource initiatives are included in your sustainability management policies?\n- A4. We will expand our initiatives. Key goals include the promotion of diversity, strengthening individuals, and the improvement of engagement.\nUnder a policy entitled \"AGC People: the driver of our growth!\", we have established the following HR programs with the aims of enabling each and every employee to reach their full potential, creating an organization that is stronger than the sum of its parts, and achieving our business strategies and organizational targets while delivering corporate and individual growth.\nWe will continue to promote a variety of initiatives based on the principles of pursuing diversity, strengthening individuals, and enhancing work engagement.\nDiversity initiatives, human resource development\n- Q5. Please outline your policies on the expansion of open innovation.\n- A5. In addition to external collaboration, we also promote collaboration within the AGC group.\nAs social issues become more complex and the speed at which they are being addressed increases, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the AGC Group to solve these issues on its own. Therefore, it has become important for us to engage in collaborative activities, such as working on value creation with client companies that foresee the future, exploring and complementing technologies with external partners such as universities, research institutes, and venture companies. Based on these activities, we will contribute to the transformation and development of society and achieve continuous growth.\nAGC\u2019s open innovation"

View Details\n- Research Summary\n-\nThis research stream explores the relations between technological change, senior executive teams, and organizational evolution. I continue to explore how innovation streams pose strategic challenges to organizations and their senior teams, and how different organizational architectures, particularly ambidextrous designs, affect a firm's ability to explore as well as exploit. I also explore how ambidextrous designs are created in firms and how they evolve over time. This work is in both the private and public sectors.This research stream focuses on the role of organizational identity as a powerful tool to adjudicate the tensions between contrasting strategic requirements. With a range of colleagues, we explore the relations between organizational identity, a firm's strategy, and its fate.I am exploring how open innovation complements traditional innovation logics. With a range of colleagues, we explore how open or distributed innovation affects incumbent firms' boundaries, designs, and identities.\nThis research area explores processes senior teams employ in order to attend to and deal with strategic paradox (e.g. explore and exploit, do well and do good).\n- Teaching\n-\nMarket-leading organizations habitually innovate, adjust quickly to new business conditions, and seize emerging opportunities before competitors do. They perform efficiently today while continuing to explore new sources of value for tomorrow. Such companies don't just happen; they're created by leaders who understand the importance of change. Leading Change and Organizational Renewal prepares you to lead a nimble organization\u2014one that blends best practices, innovation, and evolutionary change.Accelerating the Careers of High-Potential Leaders\nSuccessful businesses know that investing in the next generation of leaders is critical to sustaining competitive advantage and achieving corporate growth over the long term. The Program for Leadership Development (PLD) equips functional managers with the advanced decision-making and execution skills they need to excel as multifaceted leaders. You will emerge fully prepared to take on greater cross-functional responsibilities, facilitate change and innovation, and, ultimately, drive improved performance throughout your organization.The Harvard Business Analytics Program is offered through a collaboration between Harvard Business School (HBS), the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS).\nDesigned for aspiring and established leaders in any industry, the program leverages a rigorous cross-disciplinary curriculum to help students not just analyze data but understand it, translate it, and incorporate it into strategy at the top levels of their organizations. Students benefit from world-class instruction in courses designed by esteemed Harvard faculty and collaborate with diverse peers in highly interactive online classes. In addition, students attend two in-person immersions hosted at Harvard Business School, where they formulate solutions to real-world business scenarios and develop a network of data-minded business leaders. Students emerge from the program poised to advance into analytics-focused leadership roles and drive disruptive innovation through data.\nMarket volatility and disruptive innovation are changing the way companies compete in every industry\u2014and increasing the demand for business leaders who can manage globally in the age of digital transformation. Whether you are looking to move up to the executive suite or are about to take on greater leadership responsibilities, the Advanced Management Program will help you accelerate your personal and organizational growth.\nThis career-changing program is designed to bring about a full-scale transformation that empowers executives to lead agile, innovative firms. For seven uninterrupted and fulfilling weeks, you will strengthen your leadership gaps and expand your ability to anticipate change, capitalize on disruptive innovations, and drive performance across domains, industries, and borders.\nThis portion of a doctoral seminar at the Harvard Graduate School of Education explores the relationship between innovation, organization design, and leadership in complex educational environments. We pay particular attention to leading large system change.This doctoral seminar explores fundamental aspects of organizations and organization theory. This seminar will cover various approaches to organizations and the institutional contexts within which they operate. We will pay particular attention to innovation and differential organizational outcomes, and the role (and limits) of agency within the firm and in institutional contexts. We will also discuss organization and management theory in the context of today\u2019s society. In particular, we will explore the impact of sharply decreased communication and information processing costs on organizations and industries. This course is for students interested in understanding and, in turn, conducting research on macro-organizational topics. As research in organizations, institutions, and innovation areas are contested terrains, after moving through the basics we will focus on contentious and unresolved issues.\n- Awards & Honors\n-\nThe Academy of Management Annals (AMA) recognizes particularly impactful papers with the \"Decade Award' which is an award for the paper with the most citations 10 years after publication.

The HPCC Systems platform includes a data refinery (Thor) and a rapid data delivery engine (ROXIE) that utilize the Enterprise Control Language (ECL).[6] LexisNexis Risk Solutions open-sourced the HPCC Systems platform in 2011, and has seen some success with the adoption of this platform by diverse entities, an example being GuardHat, which makes smart hard hats with embedded HPCC Systems technology.\nHistory\n[edit]A subsidiary of RELX (formerly Reed Elsevier), LexisNexis Risk Solutions first began as the Risk & Information Analytics Group (RIAG) within LexisNexis, a corporation offering legal database services. In 2000, Reed Elsevier acquired RiskWise and PeopleWise, which together became the basis of RIAG.[7] The creation of RIAG expanded LexisNexis offerings to include public records collections. In 2000, LexisNexis also launched HPCC Systems, its data-intensive computing system platform.\nIn 1994, Reed Business Information (later Reed Elsevier and now RELX),acquired ICIS-LOR thereby adding extensive price reporting on chemicals and oil to the Reed Business Information chemicals portfolio.[8]\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions moved into Collections after Reed Elsevier acquired the public records businesses of Dolan Media Company in 2003.[9] That same year, the LexisNexis Special Services Inc. (LNSSI) was founded to provide government agencies with global sources of data fusion technology and analytics. LNSSI also granted Reed Elsevier the ability to participate in classified U.S. government programs as a foreign-owned entity.\nIn 2004, Reed Elsevier purchased Seisint Inc., based in Boca Raton, Florida.[10] Seisint housed and operated the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX).[11]\nIn February 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased data aggregator ChoicePoint.[12] This acquisition included an insurance business and the C.L.U.E. database, an underwriting database for the U.S. auto insurance market. LexisNexis completed the migration of public records to HPCC Systems the same year. Reed assumed $600 million in debt with the acquisition.[13]\nLaunch\n[edit]In September 2009, ChoicePoint was integrated with the Risk & Information Analytics Group (RIAG), and the combined new entity became LexisNexis Risk Solutions. In 2011, LexisNexis Risk Solutions was officially launched as a separate company within the Reed Elsevier portfolio.\nMark Kelsey was named CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions in December 2012.[14] Over the next two years the company purchased 12 companies, including WorldCompliance, Enclarity, Mapflow, Tracesmart, Wunelli and Health Market Science.\nDivestiture\n[edit]In January 2013, LexisNexis Risk Solutions announced it would sell its background screening business to the Palo Alto-based private equity firm Symphony Technology Group (STG). STG planned to combine LexisNexis screening with its portfolio company, First Advantage.[15]\nCoplogic (2014)\n[edit]In December 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions acquired Coplogic, a provider of citizen self-reporting software solutions to law enforcement agencies. The acquisition \u2013 which includes Coplogic\u2019s technology, staff and book of business \u2013 adds a citizen incident reporting capability to the LexisNexis eCrash solution.[16]\nInsurance Initiatives Ltd.

The system was expanded in 2017 to allow individuals to receive an email alert when a child is reported missing near to them.[32]\nIn 2017, a feature was added to ADAM to allow NCMEC to focus on a highway where a missing child and abductor may be travelling to distribute posters to recipients along the relevant corridor. Combining this filter along with the system's radius search allows for broad, yet targeted, poster coverage. Functionality was added to ADAM to allow members of the public to sign up for missing child email alerts in their area. More than 1.8 million individuals, private enterprises, hospitals, schools, news outlets and law agencies have signed up to receive automated ADAM alerts.\nU.K.\n[edit]In 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions began working with the charity Missing People and the UK National Crime Agency to support their Child Rescue Alert service, which disseminates missing alerts via text message. Along with Charlie Hedges Advisory (one of the U.K.\u2019s foremost experts on missing persons), LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Missing People scoped a training course to assist law enforcement, schools, hospitals and others with missing cases, particularly those involving children who are abducted and/or trafficked.[33]\nFood stamp fraud prevention\n[edit]Since 2013, the Florida Department of Children and Families used LexisNexis Risk Solutions for its identity management solutions to prevent food stamp fraud and improve operational efficiencies,[34] achieving a total cost avoidance of more than $843.7 million.[citation needed]\nHumanitarian emergency education\n[edit]In 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the Global Business Coalition for Education's Rapid Education Action (REACT) database to record private sector educational contributions and assets that can be deployed quickly in the wake of a humanitarian emergency.\nLaw enforcement\n[edit]PSDE database\n[edit]The Public Safety Data Exchange (PSDEX) is a contributory database that of more than 1,300 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that was created by LexisNexis Risk Solutions. PSDEX helps its participants solve crimes, identify threats and anticipate future threats. LexisNexis Risk Solutions created an Advisory Committee to advise on policy and governance of PSDEX data, to help assure adherence to federal Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), state and local standards for security and privacy of law enforcement-provided data. The PSDEX Advisory Committee is composed of former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Secret Service, metropolitan police department and other criminal justice experts, in partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions leaders.\nLexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center\n[edit]The LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center gives law enforcement \u201cgreater visibility into crime in both their jurisdictions and nationwide by linking billions of public records with agency-provided data.\u201d It links to PSDEX and brings together disconnected data to provide a more comprehensive view of people's identities so that law enforcement agencies can better target investigations, identify patterns, predict upcoming events and deploy resources more efficiently.\nCOVID-19\n[edit]COVID-19 analyzer\n[edit]In April, 2020, LexisNexis Risk Solutions created a free tracking tool[35] to monitor and report the progress of the COVID-19 virus and provide better contextual understanding of the pandemic's evolution. Using data from Johns Hopkins University (daily cases and deaths), the US Census Bureau (US population) and the UN DESA (world population), the tracker provides metrics and analysis for locations across the globe, with maps that drill down to country and regional levels, helping to understand how the virus is propagating.[36]\nIn July 2020, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's College of Engineering and Computer Science in collaboration with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, received a grant for Rapid Research (RAPID)[37] from the National Science Foundation to develop a model of COVID-19 spread using innovative big data analytics techniques and tools. The project leverages prior experience in modeling Ebola spread to successfully model the spread of COVID-19.[38]\nCOVID-19 Data Resource Center\n[edit]The Health Care segment of LexisNexis Risk Solutions announced in April 2020 the launch of a free COVID-19 Data Resource Center to provide county-level insights on at-risk populations and potential care capacity gaps to support the U.S. healthcare industry's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. By combining its own data and analytics with those of other industry stakeholders, the company created insights to be used by healthcare organizations, public health officials and health researchers to help allocate resources to the populations with the greatest need.[39] The COVID-19 Data Resource Center features heat maps with insights that identify at-risk populations and correlated gaps in provider coverage. Each county is assigned a percentile rank on a scale of 0 (low-risk) to 100 (high-risk) across various parameters. The map is updated regularly to quickly address the care needs of the community. In June 2020, the group added national telehealth trending insights to its COVID-19 Data Resource Center to show exponential growth of telehealth adoption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.[40]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"US SEC: Form 20-F Relx Group\".
