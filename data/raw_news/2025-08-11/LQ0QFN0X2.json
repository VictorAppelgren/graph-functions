  "title": "Uvalde school district releases records for 2022 classroom shooting, after legal fight over access",
  "description": "The mass shooting at Robb Elementary School\u200b in Uvalde, Texas, killed 19 students and two teachers\u200b. The slow law enforcement response has been widely condemned.",
  "content": "School officials in Uvalde, Texas, on Monday released text messages, personnel files and student records of the shooter from the 2022 attack at Robb Elementary School, following a yearslong legal battle over public access to the material.\n\nThe records include emails between top school district officials and also text messages and emails to and from at least two school police officers who were on the scene. The release also contains the personnel file of former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, who has been described as the on-scene commander of the law enforcement response.\n\nThe release included a handful of text exchanges between Arredondo and others at the district that were sent before the shooting. At 9:04 a.m., the chief told officer Adrian Gonzales to \"go hang out at the park with the seniors until 11:30.\" At 11:40 a.m. a text to Arredondo from a district secretary noted someone reported hearing shots outside Robb Elementary.\n\n\"They went ahead and locked themselves down,\" the text to Arredondo read. At 1:07 p.m., a text to Arredondo asked if any students were injured or taken to the hospital and asked if the district can lift the \"secure status\" on the school. The shooter had been killed by law enforcement about 15 minutes earlier.\n\nMedia organizations, including CBS News and The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers.\n\nA Texas appeals court in July upheld a lower court's ruling that the records must be released.\n\nThe records are not the public's first glimpse inside one of the nation's deadliest mass shootings and a slow law enforcement response that has been widely condemned. Last year, city officials in Uvalde released police body camera videos and recordings of 911 calls.\n\nNearly 400 officers waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers. Multiple federal and state investigations into the response have laid bare cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of children and teachers.\n\nTwo school district officers face criminal charges for their actions that day. The former schools police chief, Arredondo, and former officer Adrian Gonzales both face multiple counts of child endangerment and abandonment. Both men have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial later this year.\n\nThey are the only two responding officers to have been charged.\n\nLaura Prather, media law chair for Haynes Boone, which represented the media organizations in the suit, said in a statement Monday night: \"More than three years after the Robb Elementary School shooting, the release of long-withheld public records by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District is an important step toward giving the community the answers they deserve. The court's ruling makes clear that government agencies cannot hide behind vague legal claims to withhold public information.\"\n\n\"Three years is already too long to wait for truth and transparency that could prevent future tragedies,\" Prather added.",

She was just picking up the camera and starting to enjoy photography. She had a very fun clothing style.

And she was also saying, like, 'What if I make it? I'm gonna be so nervous.' And I was like, 'Girl, you got this. You're gonna be good at it. You got this.' So she was excited.\"\nAlithia Ramirez, 10\nAlithia Ramirez had recently celebrated her 10th birthday, her family told gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke.\n\"Alithia was killed yesterday,\" O'Rourke tweeted on Wednesday. \"Her parents welcomed me into their home today.

She also shared a Facebook post about her sister's death.\n\"My sweet baby sister, I would've never thought I would be typing something like this. I honestly have no words just sadness, confusion, and anger. I'm sad because we will never get to tag team on mom and dad again and tell each other how much we mean to each other, I'm confused because how can something like this happen to my sweet, caring, and beautiful sister, and I'm angry because a coward took you from us. Sissy I miss you so much, I just want to hold you and tell you how pretty you are, I want to take you outside and practice softball, I want to go on one last family vacation, I want to hear your contagious laugh, and I want you to hear me tell you how much I love you. Tessy mom, dad, and I won't be the same without you but we are comforted knowing you are waiting for us up in heaven and have a spot for us.
