  "title": "Should You Buy Tech Now, or Wait to See If Tariffs Raise Prices?",
  "description": "With the US government rapidly changing its stance about tariffs as President Donald Trump negotiates, tech purchasers can either buy quickly now or wait until numbers are finalized.",
  "content": "The US is shifting its trade policy as President Donald Trump renegotiates terms with nations across the globe. After declaring the trade deficit a national emergency, the administration initially proposed a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, later reduced to 30% during a 90-day negotiation period.\n\nWith tech products like Apple devices caught in the middle, is now the right time to buy the latest gadgets, or should you wait for global trade to stabilize?\n\nConsumers planning to replace their phones or televisions soon may want to act quickly. It\u2019s worth assessing whether the upgrade includes features essential for home or business use, and whether current devices still have meaningful lifespan left.\n\nFor instance, my personal laptop has about one more big project left in it, or a year or two of life. I didn\u2019t \u201cpanic buy\u201d a laptop this spring, although I did think about switching phones. (I\u2019d recently spent about the price of a new Apple laptop on travel instead.)\n\nOn the other hand, buying now guarantees access to a current-generation device regardless of what happens over the next four years.\n\nProponents of the tariffs argue that reshoring manufacturing, particularly in advanced chipmaking, would benefit the US economy.\n\nSEE: Trump postponed a 50% tariff on all imports from the EU\n\nLegal status of tariffs is in flux\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. Court of International Trade on Wednesday blocked the tariffs from coming into effect, ruling they are an overreach of presidential authority. The Trade Act of 1974 does allow a president to impose temporary trade taxes up to 15%, the court noted, and the Trump administration declared it was \u201ccommitted\u201d to its original declaration of a national emergency around trade deficits. Tech companies and buyers may see a reprieve if the court can enforce the ruling.\n\nAs of Thursday, it can\u2019t. A federal appeals court granted the administration\u2019s request to pause the ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, economists have begun referring to Trump\u2019s tariff policy using the acronym \u201cTACO\u201d (Trump Always Chickens Out) \u2014 a pejorative indicating the administration often backs down from severe tariff threats.\n\nRaw materials and resources underpinning the tech industry could be hit with tariffs\n\nMany raw materials used in global technology production originate in China; in the event of a trade war, US battery storage operations could be severely affected. China\u2019s export controls on rare earth metals, essential components in computer chips, could also disrupt production at manufacturing plants in the EU. These restrictions are widely seen as a preemptive move as China braces for further escalation in trade tensions with the US.\n\nA report by energy analytics firm Wood Mackenzie warns that higher tariffs could reduce global GDP by about 3% by 2030, driven by impacts on oil, gas power, and metals markets.\n\nShoppers eyeing new Apple devices later this year shouldn\u2019t expect steep discounts. Apple products are likely to be affected by tariffs, as the vast majority of those devices are manufactured overseas. For example, an iPhone that previously retailed for $1,200 could increase in price to $1,500 under new tariff rates. Analysts estimate that fully manufacturing iPhones within the US could drive retail prices up to $3,500 per unit.\n\nTo mitigate these effects, Apple has begun shifting parts of its supply chain out of China. According to CEO Tim Cook, most iPhones sold through June 2025 will originate from India, where Apple is scaling up production. The company also maintains a manufacturing presence in Vietnam.\n\nThis transition may not shield Apple from rising costs. \u201cPrices may still go up as India will not be as efficient in manufacturing as China but may be less impacted by tariffs,\u201d said Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal in an email to TechRepublic.\n\nThe shift has also drawn political pushback. Trump criticized Apple\u2019s move to India and even threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones specifically, a policy that, for now, remains unenforced.\n\nApple and similar companies may choose to absorb some of the cost increases internally to avoid passing them along to consumers. But, Atwal said, Apple is more likely to try to make manufacturing more efficient and reduce cost structure.\n\n\u201cThere may be short-term impact on margins, but Apple may focus on pushing higher priced goods to users to maintain revenue and then margins,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat about devices assembled in the US? Apple produces some semiconductors at a TSMC facility in Phoenix, but they are still shipped overseas for assembly.\n\nTrump suggests 25% tariffs could be applied to Samsung phones\n\nOn May 23, Trump said Samsung devices could face the same 25% tariff as Apple products. Many Samsung models sold in the US are manufactured in Vietnam or India. While Samsung also manufactures in South Korea, Brazil, and Indonesia, those units primarily serve local markets and are not widely exported to the US. The company also assembles televisions in Mexico.\n\nIn its April earnings call, Samsung CFO Soon-cheol Park predicted \u201cpotential risk of demand slowdown\u201d due to uncertainty around US tariffs. Samsung may consider relocating some of its manufacturing if high tariffs remain in place.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft are insulated from some economic uncertainty regarding tariffs\n\nWhile Google and Microsoft are headquartered in the US, both companies manufacture a significant portion of its hardware abroad. Google and Microsoft are likely stockpiling devices in US warehouses ahead of possible tariffs; once that inventory runs out, increased import costs may be passed on to consumers.\n\nMicrosoft assembles many of its laptops and tablets in China and Vietnam. Game consoles could also experience price increases. Additionally, it may incur higher hardware costs for its own operations.\n\nHowever, as a software-centric business, much of Microsoft\u2019s revenue is less exposed to tariffs. CEO Satya Nadella said in an April earnings call that the company may be well-positioned to help enterprises reduce costs through software solutions in uncertain economic conditions.\n\nGoogle\u2019s primary revenue stream \u2014 digital advertising \u2014 is unlikely to be affected by tariffs on physical goods; however, the company could feel the impact if advertisers reduce spending amid rising prices. Additionally, Google\u2019s infrastructure investments in data centers \u2014 such as servers and networking hardware \u2014 may face cost increases if components are hit by tariffs.\n\nOverall, Google and Microsoft are less likely than Apple or Samsung to experience substantial product price increases.\n\nPrices of smart home and IoT devices may increase\n\nTariffs could also affect the prices of smart home and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Brands like LG, Dyson, and others may see their costs rise. General Electric produces most of its components domestically, which could help it maintain price stability. Although GE\u2019s appliance division was sold to Chinese manufacturer Haier, its products are still assembled in Kentucky.\n\nAmazon\u2019s smart home devices, including Alexa products and Kindles, are manufactured by Foxconn in China, making them vulnerable to tariff pressures.\n\nTariffs on lithium-ion batteries and many small home electronics \u2014 most of which are produced in China \u2014 are also expected to increase prices across multiple consumer categories.\n\nSEE: Our previous coverage about tariffs and tech prices\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nWith reciprocal tariffs expected to take effect in June \u2014 and with the US administration using device prices as a bargaining chip \u2014 uncertainty remains. Analysts suggest Trump could be starting the negotiations with aggressive tariff proposals to force global partners to concede, with final numbers likely to land lower than initial threats.",

      "text": "Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones if they are not made in the United States, as he stepped up the pressure on Apple to build its signature product in the country.\nThe president wiped approximately $70bn (\u00a352bn) off the company\u2019s shares with a post on the Truth Social platform that said iPhones sold inside the US must be made within the country\u2019s borders.\nTrump said in the post: \u201cI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.\u201d\nApple shares fell 2.6% on Trump\u2019s comments, pushing the company\u2019s valuation just below $3tn.\nApple won\u2019t be alone. In remarks to reporters at the White House on Friday afternoon, Trump said that he would also impose a 25% tariff on Samsung and any other phone manufacturer that makes phones outside of the US, or, he said, \u201cit would not be fair.\u201d\n\u201cWhen they build their plant here, there\u2019s no tariffs. So they\u2019re going to be building plants here,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump alarmed Apple investors last month with a series of escalating tariff announcements on goods from China, where the majority of iPhones are assembled, which ratcheted up to total 145%. A couple of days later, however, the administration announced an exemption for smartphones and computers.\nSoon afterwards, it was reported that Apple was planning to switch assembly of all iPhones for the US market to India in an attempt to swerve the impact of Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\nCook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in an earnings call this month that the majority of iPhones sold in the US for the June quarter would \u201chave India as their country of origin\u201d. The company is secretive about details of its production processes but analysts estimate that about 90% of its smartphones are assembled in China.\nThe US is Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone market, where it sells more than 60m of the handsets annually.\nTrump rebuked the tech company and its chief executive this month over the switch. \u201cI had a little problem with Tim Cook,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI said to Tim \u2026 \u2018we\u2019ve treated you really good, we\u2019ve put up with all the plants that you\u2019ve built in China for years, now you got to build [for] us. We\u2019re not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves \u2026 we want you to build here.\u2019\u201d\nAnalysts have warned that moving US-bound iPhone production to the States would be prohibitively expensive, owing to the lack of facilities and flexible workforce that Apple has access to in China. Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm, said last month that an iPhone made in the US would be more three times more expensive than now at $3,500."

      "text": "Apple has had few incentives in the past to start making iPhones in US\nApple has had few incentives in the past to start making iPhones in US\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Lashing out at Apple\u2019s plans to make most of its U.S. iPhones in India, President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to slap a 25% tariff on the popular device unless the tech giant starts building the product in its home country \u2014 a move that still seems unlikely to happen any time soon, if ever.\nApple for decades has been building most of its devices in China, where it has invested tens of billions of dollars on massive factories that rely on a vast network of local suppliers. The company\u2019s reliance on a crucial pipeline outside the U.S. thrust the technology trendsetter into the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s trade war.\nIn response to Trump\u2019s tussle with China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the March-June period would come from India. Although Trump in late April decided to temporarily exempt the iPhone and other electronics from most of his initial tariffs, Cook said the trade war would end up costing Apple an additional $900 million during the March-June period.\nAfter Trump initially unveiled his sweeping tariffs in early April, industry analysts estimated the fees would drive up the cost of a $1,200 iPhone made in China to $1,500. That might sound steep, but most analysts believe if Apple somehow could suddenly start making iPhones in the U.S., prices for the devices would soar to at least $2,000 and possibly might rise as high as $3,500.\nThe disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that Cook began to engineer during the 1990s while he was working for his predecessor, company co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S. Combined with current economic forces, the price of an iPhone could triple, threatening to torpedo sales of Apple\u2019s marquee product, which generated revenue of $201 billion during the company\u2019s last fiscal year.\n\u201cThe concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a nonstarter,\u201d asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple\u2019s every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn\u2019t be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it\u2019s hard to comprehend.\u201d\nIn a Friday research note, Ives predicted Cook would engage in a \u201cgame of negotiations\u201d with Trump that would spare the iPhone from the 25% tariffs.\nPlanning for the future is also becoming more difficult for Apple and other technology companies amid the upheaval being caused by the rapid rise of artificial intelligence. As AI becomes more sophisticated, the technology may spawn a forthcoming wave of hands-free and screen-free devices that diminish the demand for smartphones.\n\u201cYou may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as it sounds,\u201d Apple executive Eddy Cue said earlier this month during a trial about the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s proposed breakup of Google for running an illegal monopoly in search.\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. On a quarterly earnings call earlier in May, Cook told investors that tariffs had a \u201climited impact\u201d on the company in the March quarter because it was able to optimize its supply chain. But Cook warned that it is \u201cvery difficult\u201d to predict beyond June \u201cbecause I\u2019m not sure what will happen with tariffs.\u201d\nThe big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices if Trump\u2019s threatened tolls become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden. Even without an escalation in tariffs, many analysts are predicting Apple will raise iPhone prices this autumn when the latest models are typically released \u2014 a prospect that could prod consumers to splurge on an upgrade this summer.\nOne of the main reasons that Apple has had wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.\nBut now Apple is facing a significant decline in its service revenue after a federal judge recently issued an order prohibiting it from collecting commissions on transactions within iPhone apps that are processed on other payment systems other than its own. Unless Apple prevails in an appeal, the decision could cost the company billions of dollars annually.\nApple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS News program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.\nBut during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.\n\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d"

      "text": "Getty Images/iStockphoto\nHow U.S. tariffs are reshaping the tech landscape\nThe Trump Administration's tariffs levy a minimum 10% tax on global imports, heavily affecting tech industry supply chains.\nA key tenet of U.S. President Donald Trump's second-term campaign promise -- the imposition of widespread tariffs -- became a reality upon his return to office in January 2025.\nTrump's stated goal with the tariffs is to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. to revitalize the golden age of manufacturing. He also wants to fight back against what he sees as unfair trade policies with other nations.\nTrump declared April 2, 2025, \"Liberation Day,\" announcing a minimum 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, effective April 5, 2025, along with higher tariffs on imports from several nations. The largest tariff was on imports from China -- which reached 145% at one point. On May 12, 2025, the U.S. and China announced they reached an agreement to de-escalate the trade war between the two countries, temporarily lowering tariffs for 90 days. New tariff amounts would be 30% on Chinese imports to the U.S., and 10% on U.S. imports to China. Higher tariffs were delayed another 90 days on Aug. 11, 2025, with a new negotiation deadline of Nov. 9, 2025.\nThere has been much confusion and backpedaling regarding the actual imposition of tariffs against various nations and industries. For instance, after initially imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, the administration retracted the measures, granting these countries a temporary reprieve. A 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs was extended to some nations after Trump made his initial declaration.\nOn July 7, 2025, the Trump Administration extended the deadline for reciprocal tariffs from July 9 to Aug. 1, 2025. At the same time, the administration announced new country-specific tariff rates ranging from 25% to 40% for 14 nations.\nKeen to beat the Aug.1 deadline, on July 27, 2025, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump announced a new EU-US tariff deal. The deal will see a 15% tariff on EU exports to the U.S. Although European negotiators avoided the initial 30% tariff proposed by Trump, many remain unsatisfied with the deal. European leaders, including French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, have criticized its terms.\nThe extension reflects ongoing negotiations with trading partners, though the administration has indicated that countries failing to reach agreements by Aug. 1 will face the announced tariff rates.\nAhead of the Aug.1 deadline, there was a flurry of deals announced, notably a 15% tariff rate for South Korea and a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports. The U.S. granted a 90-day extension for Mexico, giving the two nations time to continue negotiations. However, on July 31, 2025, Trump increased Canada's tariff rate from 25% to 35% stating Canada \"failed to cooperate\" on limiting drugs -- such as fentanyl -- entering the U.S.\nCheck out this timeline of trade actions regarding tariffs here.\nWhile U.S. tariffs are being felt throughout many industries, the technology landscape is particularly at risk. The global technology industry has long operated on the backbone of intricate supply chains spanning Asia, North America and Europe. Tariffs helped trigger stock price declines from major tech vendors -- including Apple and Nvidia -- as they are forced to figure out how to deal with increased costs, supply chain disruptions and the need to reassess manufacturing strategies.\nOverview of U.S. tariffs on tech\nAt the most basic level, a tariff is a form of taxation.\nTariffs are a type of tax that has been used worldwide for centuries. They are imposed on imported goods and aim to make foreign products more expensive and less competitive than domestically produced items.\nTrump aims to incentivize businesses to move manufacturing to the U.S., which he expects will create jobs and strengthen the economy.\nThe reality is a bit more nuanced. Tariffs are not paid by the target on which they are imposed. Instead, they are paid by the distributors that transport goods into the country that imposed the tariff. That cost is then usually passed on to consumers through higher prices. In the tech sector, there is additional complexity as products assembled domestically often contain imported components that remain subject to tariffs, adding layers of cost.\nThe tariffs imposed by Trump are also not a one-size-fits-all approach. Four primary components affect different parts of the technology industry.\n- Universal baseline tariff. A 10% tax on all imports, effective April 5, 2025.\n- Reciprocal tariffs. These are country-specific rates calculated based on bilateral trade balances. For example, China faces a combined rate of 145%.\n- Sector-specific levies. A 25% tax on steel and aluminum. A 25% tax on steel and aluminum and a 50% tariff on copper.\n- Retaliatory adjustments. On April 11, 2025, the administration announced exemptions for semiconductors and consumer hardware but maintained higher rates for most goods from China.\nAs part of the July 2025 tariff announcement, the Trump Administration has threatened to impose a set of differentiated country-specific rates -- scheduled to take effect Aug. 1, 2025 -- that will affect the technology sector.\nOf note for the technology industry are a series of country-specific tariffs, including the following:\n- Japan faces a 25% tariff, which has the potential to affect multiple technology vendors -- including Sony and Nintendo -- as well as their extended supply chains.\n- South Korea also faces a 25% tariff, which will pose challenges to many technology vendors -- notably Samsung, which is based in the country.\n- Malaysia faces a 25% tariff, which could affect Dell's PC manufacturing operations.\n- The European Union is also at risk with the Trump Administration threatening to impose a 30% tariff on imports starting Aug. 1.\nThe 2025 tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration are not the first time the technology industry has been affected by tariffs. In 1987, the U.S. imposed a short-lived 100% tariff on Japanese electronics. The U.S. has also had larger tariffs on components such as solar panels since 2018.\nLegal challenges\nThe U.S. tariffs have faced legal challenges since first being announced.\nOn May 28, 2025, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) struck down certain tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling was the law doesn't give the president power to impose sweeping import taxes in response to a long-running U.S. trade deficit.\nA day later, on May 29, 2025, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) granted a temporary stay on the CIT ruling as the Trump Administration pursues an appeal.\nCompleted trade agreements\nAs of July 16, 2025, only two countries have completed trade deals with the Trump Administration:\n- United Kingdom. The UK agreed to keep tariffs at the 10% baseline level in exchange for increased U.S. market access.\n- Vietnam. Vietnam agreed to a 20% tariff rate, down from an initially threatened 46%, in exchange for trade concessions.\nMexico and Canada have partial exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, though other goods from these countries face 25% tariffs.\nIntegrated supply chain effect\nIn the modern technology landscape, sole-source supplying of any fully finished technology device is a rarity. Modern technology is typically composed of components that come from many different locations.\nEven if a product is labeled \"Made in USA,\" the complex nature of technology supply chains means numerous components within that product originated in places other than the U.S. For example, a smartphone assembled in Texas might contain a processor manufactured in Taiwan, memory chips from South Korea, a display panel from Japan and various smaller components from China. This complex component sourcing means complete insulation from tariffs would require domestic assembly and a full domestic supply chain.\nChallenges in semiconductor production\nThe semiconductor industry is particularly at risk from tariffs. Semiconductors are found in most electronics today -- including automobiles. In 2025, most semiconductors manufactured globally will be made outside the U.S. The most prominent vendor in the world is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which manufactures most of its chips in Taiwan.\nLike many modern manufacturing activities, semiconductor manufacturing is a complicated process. It requires raw materials, including rare earth minerals such as high-purity quartz. The U.S. does produce some of the needed materials, though it has faced challenges due to natural disasters. In September 2024, production in the largest quartz mines in Spruce Pine, N.C., was disrupted due to the effects of Hurricane Helene. Full production at the mines is not expected to fully resume until the end of the second quarter of 2025.\nThough the U.S. has rare earth mineral resources, China has larger resources and accounts for a larger global market share.\nRare earth minerals needed for semiconductors include the following:\n- High-purity quartz\n- Gallium\n- Germanium\n- Dysprosium\n- Neodymium\nBeyond the raw materials, semiconductor manufacturing relies on fabrication facilities -- or semiconductor fabs. These fabs cost more than $20 billion to build and require years of development before becoming fully operational.\nTSMC announced plans to expand U.S. manufacturing, as have Intel and Samsung. Proposed plants are set to be in Arizona, Texas and Ohio, but these facilities won't be operational for several years.\nEfforts to bring more silicon manufacturing to the U.S. predate the Trump Administration. Former President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act in 2022, promising to build out U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capacity. The Trump Administration is taking its own view on the CHIPS Act to help further accelerate the process of building out semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.\nTech companies affected by tariffs\nTech companies of all sizes are affected by the Trump Administration tariffs, including the following:\nAmazon\nAmazon faces multiple effects from the tariffs. Amazon's hardware -- including its Echo smart speaker, Ring smart home and Kindle e-book reader platforms -- is all built offshore.\nLike Microsoft's Azure, AWS is affected by larger input costs for the hardware it needs for data center operations.\nApple\nApple faces significant exposure to the new tariffs. In 2025, most of Apple's hardware products --including iPhones, iPads and MacBooks -- are assembled in China and risk large tariffs on Chinese imports. On April 14, 2025, the Trump Administration issued an exemption for some consumer electronics, including Apple's products -- though it's unclear how long the exemption will last.\nThe risk of tariffs has forced Apple to accelerate plans to diversify its manufacturing base beyond China -- exploring options in countries such as India, Vietnam and Malaysia.\nIntel\nIntel's global operations and supply chain face increased raw materials and component costs. Intel has been working to expand its U.S. manufacturing capacity, but it requires significant time and investment to implement fully.\nMicrosoft\nWhile Microsoft is less exposed to hardware tariffs than companies such as Apple and Nvidia, its Surface line of products and Xbox gaming consoles are manufactured globally and are at risk from the new tariffs.\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud computing infrastructure requires a lot of hardware -- including Nvidia chips -- which are affected by tariffs. Microsoft has been exploring ways to mitigate these effects through supply chain adjustments and potential price increases on hardware products.\nNvidia\nNvidia has a global manufacturing supply chain that helps the company produce AI accelerators and GPU hardware technologies.\nNvidia doesn't own manufacturing facilities but contracts with companies such as TSMC. The new tariff structure significantly affects Nvidia's cost structure, potentially affecting the price and availability of its critical products for data centers and AI applications.\nOn April 14, 2025, Nvidia announced it would invest $500 billion to manufacture AI chips in the U.S. The announcement came as the Trump Administration continued pushing businesses to reshore their manufacturing facilities.\nSamsung\nAs a South Korean company, Samsung has somewhat different exposure to U.S. tariffs than its U.S. counterparts. However, the global nature of Samsung's operations means it still faces challenges from the new tariffs. The company manufactures many consumer electronics in various countries, subject to increased U.S. import taxes. Samsung's semiconductor business also supplies chips to many technology companies -- including American ones.\nSupply chain adjustments\nBusinesses are looking at existing supply chains and considering various options and adjustments.\nGiven the complexity of modern supply chains in the tech sector, implementing adjustments will likely be time-consuming. During the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains were also disrupted from 2020 to 2022 -- in some cases, while organizations scrambled to find alternative suppliers with full operational capacity.\nWhile nearly every nation on Earth is subject to tariffs, some countries are more at risk. China is a primary target of Trump's tariff agenda. As such, organizations are increasingly looking to move supply chains away from China-based manufacturing.\nAmong the locations where tech vendors are looking to shift manufacturing are the following:\n- Vietnam. While still subject to tariffs, the Vietnamese government appears more willing to work with the Trump Administration than with China. However, Vietnam lacks the manufacturing scale currently available in China.\n- India. The Indian government has also been willing to negotiate with the Trump Administration and could be a location for more tech manufacturers, particularly for smartphone production.\n- Onshoring. There is also renewed interest and activity across the tech sector for bringing more manufacturing and supply chain components back to U.S. soil.\nStrategic responses from the tech industry\nThe tech industry has not sat idly by while the Trump Administration has announced and implemented tariffs.\nMultiple technology leaders have directly contacted the Trump Administration regarding the tariffs. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly had talks with U.S. officials and convinced them to grant a temporary exemption for Apple products built in China.\nThe tech industry has employed several other strategies, in addition to direct lobbying of government officials, including the following:\n- Vertical integration. Organizations are attempting to manufacture more in the U.S., such as TSMC's $100 billion investment in U.S.-based chip production. Multiple U.S. technology vendors -- including industry heavyweights Apple, IBM and Nvidia -- have pledged to increase U.S.-based manufacturing.\n- Tariff engineering. The tariffs are complex and have multiple categories. Some vendors have been working to adjust their product definitions to fit into lower-cost tariff categories.\n- Inventory buffering. Before the tariff imposition date, some organizations stockpiled larger-than-usual quantities of products to avoid paying the additional costs.\nOther industries affected\nThe tech industry isn't the only industry affected by the Trump Administration's tariffs. Other sectors include the following:\n- Retail. This is likely to have a broad effect on the retail sector. Items such as toys, shoes and clothing -- made mainly in China -- will become more expensive. Grocery prices have also steadily increased.\n- Healthcare and pharmaceutical. In the healthcare sector, medical devices, in particular, are at risk from tariffs, as they typically incorporate advanced technology components made in multiple countries. Pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on globally sourced ingredients, some of which come from China. Trump has also mentioned a forthcoming tariff on pharmaceuticals, but there is no additional information yet.\n- Automotive. The auto sector is directly at risk with the imposition of a 25% tariff on non-U.S.-manufactured vehicles and auto parts. There is also a 25% tariff on all imported steel and aluminum. The tariffs are particularly challenging for electric vehicle manufacturers such as Tesla, as battery production and rare earth minerals essential for battery technology are heavily concentrated in China.\n- Hospitality and travel. The tariffs are likely to affect discretionary spending, which will impact hospitality and travel in the U.S. Because of a decrease in demand from American consumers, airfare has even decreased -- 5.3% in March vs. the same time last year. Many international tourists have also stopped visiting the U.S. in opposition to the tariffs.\n- Finance. The uncertainty surrounding the Trump Administration tariffs and their effect on the global economy has also affected the stock market, which has experienced high levels of volatility. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has fallen more than 2,000 points since Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025. U.S. bond prices have also fallen, as investors face uncertainty over the economic impacts of tariffs. Instead, many investors have turned to gold as a safe-haven investment. Gold reached an all-time high of $3,500 per ounce on April 22, 2025.\nSean Michael Kerner is an IT consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer.

      "text": "Trading cases Tariff scenarios for taxing times\nMay 2025\nMay 2025\nThe Trump administration\u2019s \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 tariff announcement on 2 April was arguably the most pivotal moment for the world economy since China\u2019s 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization. While the latter turbo-charged growth in global trade, the sweeping US tariffs \u2013 and ensuing retaliation by numerous countries \u2013 threaten to upend established trading relationships and accelerate the retreat in globalisation that has been underway since the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe White House\u2019s numerous tariff-policy adjustments since early April have made understanding the impact and implications of the levies harder still. The potential for trade deals with major trading partners, further policy changes and even a full U-turn in the US position add to the uncertainty. At the time of writing, the US and China had announced temporary reductions in their bilateral tariffs, following progress in trade talks. However, those reductions were but a \u201cpause\u201d in elevated tariffs, set to last only until mid-August.\nThe scale of the tariffs \u2013 be they already implemented or merely threatened \u2013 has far-reaching implications for the energy and natural resources sectors. The lower economic growth they entail will curb commodity demand, prices and investment, while higher import prices will raise costs in sectors from battery storage to liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nSuch uncertain times require planning for divergent outcomes. Wood Mackenzie has developed three distinct scenarios that consider the potential impacts on global GDP, industrial production, and supply, demand and prices out to 2030 in four sectors: oil, gas and LNG, renewable power, and metals and mining.\nThree scenarios for the global economy and trade\nTrade truce \u2013 low tariffs\nOur most optimistic scenario, a trade truce, assumes a reversal of the current US tariff policy, with trade barriers quickly returning to 2024 levels. Amid better trade deals and rising global exports as a share of GDP, globalisation enjoys something of an unlikely renaissance. In this scenario, the world economy continues to grow, by an average 2.7% a year to 2030.\nTrade tensions \u2013 10% tariffs\nOur second scenario, trade tensions, currently looks like the most probable outcome. Global tariff barriers increase, but an all-out trade war is avoided. The US effective average tariff rate rises from 2.3% in 2024 to 10% in 2026-2030. Supply-chain relocation adds to trade friction, but is manageable. The near-term economic impact is felt most noticeably in the US, Europe and China, though all remain in positive economic growth territory, despite growth being 1.1 percentage points lower than in our trade truce scenario by 2030.\nTrade war \u2013 30%-plus tariffs\nUnder our trade-war scenario, the US implements the tariffs announced on 2 April in full, with trading partners retaliating. The US effective tariff rate quickly exceeds 30%. This causes maximal supply-chain disruption, including US-China decoupling, triggering a global recession. In this scenario, global GDP is 2.9% lower by 2030.\nA trade war between the US and China is acutely damaging to both economies in the short term. By 2030, US resilience may limit its losses, although China\u2019s weak domestic drivers compound the loss of exports to the US and reduced global demand. The trade war\u2019s ripple effects expose economic vulnerabilities beyond the epicentre, including the EU and UK.\nImpact of tariff scenarios on key sectors\nOil\n|\nTrade truce |\nDemand and prices in line with the pre-tariff base case |\n|\nTrade tensions |\nPrices fall as demand weakens; small drop in US liquids production |\n|\nTrade war |\nBrent averages US$50/bbl in 2026; significant impact on supply |\nIn the trade truce scenario, global oil demand continues to grow steadily, boosted by stronger economic growth. Demand increases by 4.4 million barrels per day (b/d) from 2024 to 108 million b/d in 2030, broadly in line with our pre-tariff base case.\nMeanwhile, global liquids production capacity rises 7.5 million b/d to 116.9 million b/d in 2030. OPEC accounts for most of the increase, with natural gas liquids a key driver of growth. Prices in the low-to-mid US$70/bbl annual average range in real terms support US Lower 48 production as a core driver of non-OPEC growth. By 2030, Brent is projected to average US$74/bbl.\nIn this scenario, currently low refining margins are the sectoral trough. With oil demand growth outpacing capacity additions beyond H2 2026, refining margins recover before plateauing in the late 2020s. The global composite gross refining margin reaches almost US$10/bbl in 2030, up almost US$4/bbl from 2025 levels.\nIn the trade tensions scenario, the pace of oil demand growth is slower, but not dramatically so. Global demand still rises by 3.5 million b/d by 2030, almost 1 million b/d less than in the trade truce scenario. Slower demand growth means lower prices: Brent averages US$68/bbl in 2030 in real terms, US$6/bbl less than in the trade truce scenario.\nLower prices curtail drilling and completion activity in the US Lower 48, reducing a key source of non-OPEC supply growth.\nGlobal refinery utilisation still improves in this scenario, but at a slower pace, with 2026 likely to be the low point in refining margins. From 2026, global composite gross refining margins recover more slowly, increasing from 2025 levels by only US$3/bbl.\nThe trade war scenario is the most economically destructive, cutting oil demand growth sharply. A world recession leads to an outright fall in global oil consumption in 2026. Demand growth resumes from 2027, but overall demand by 2030 is still 2.5 million b/d lower than under the trade truce scenario.\nWeaker demand leads to a plunge in prices as supply significantly surpasses global demand. We project Brent crude to average US$50/bbl in 2026, recovering somewhat after 2026 as the price shock helps stabilise the supply and demand balance. Oil prices are still expected to be weak by the end of the decade in this scenario, with Brent projected to average US$63/bbl in real terms in 2030. That is US$11/bbl lower than under the trade truce scenario.\nOil at US$50/bbl is a gamechanger. Wood Mackenzie analysis shows that the economics of Lower 48 drilling won\u2019t support production growth with crude at US$50/bbl, despite corporate ambitions to keep pushing down breakevens. In the trade war scenario, we would expect a reduction in investment, leading to lower US oil production through to 2030. Supply growth outside the US would also be affected by low proces due to reduced budgets for upstream projects, with delays expected in projects not yet under development.\nA significant fall in oil demand in 2026 results in the global composite gross refining margins collapsing to breakeven levels. Global refining margins remain broadly flat at US$1 to US$2/bbl below current levels until the end of this decade, creating pressure for the rationalisation of weaker sites, particularly in Europe.\nGas and LNG\n|\nTrade truce |\nGlobal LNG market remains tight in 2025; risk of oversupply from 2027 |\n|\nTrade tensions |\nAccelerated rebalancing of the global LNG market at lower prices |\n|\nTrade war |\nLNG demand hit hard; prices drop close to US$7.5/mmbtu by 2027 |\nUnder the trade truce scenario, with trade barriers returning to 2024 levels, the global LNG market remains tight in 2025, despite weak Asian LNG demand. Europe needs to rebuild storage after a cold winter, while facing the loss of further Russian supply following the end of the Ukraine transit agreement. But the anticipated oversupply emerging from 2027 remains inevitable, even if tariffs are removed. With a major expansion of LNG supply already under construction and more supply expected to reach final investment decision (FID) in the coming years, LNG supply is set to increase by , more than 40% higher than current levels. Asian LNG demand will enter a new phase of growth, increasing by 120 Mt by 2030, but Europe will need to absorb more LNG than required, pushing average prices down from US$11.2/mmbtu in 2024 to around US$7.2/mmbtu by 2030.\nIn the US, however, upward pressure on prices increases from a combination of LNG export growth and increased power demand from data centres. Henry Hub prices increase above US$4.5/mmbtu by 2030 from US$2.4/mmbtu in 2024.\nThe trade tensions scenario has a more modest impact on LNG than on oil. Weaker trade flows and economic growth slows gas demand growth in Asia compared with the trade truce scenario, accelerating the rebalancing of the global LNG market at lower prices.\nWe would not expect these effects to be very large, given inelastic heating demand and continued growth in industrial production. We project gas demand to be about 10 bcm (7.2 Mt) per year lower across Europe and Asia than under the trade truce scenario. This results in modestly weaker LNG prices, reaching US$6.9/mmbtu by 2030. In the US, the trade tensions scenario does little to derail LNG growth, keeping Henry Hub prices high.\nThe trade war scenario hits LNG demand hard amid greater market oversupply. Chinese LNG demand falls sharply, while tariffs force buyers to redirect US LNG cargoes. Sluggish demand in Asia means more excess LNG supply is absorbed in Europe, where economic stagnation limits gas use. Prices could drop close to US$7.5/mmbtu by 2027.\nIn the US, LNG exporters face a squeeze on margins. US gas prices remain resilient in this scenario, despite a downturn in the economy, as falling oil prices reduce US associated gas production, requiring the production of additional higher-breakeven dry gas. US LNG offtakers are likely to cancel some cargoes, as the margins to global prices shrink.\nThe period of severe global oversupply of LNG could be prolonged beyond 2030 if momentum behind project FIDs persists into 2026. China has signed 17 mmtpa of firm contracts with US LNG projects, but high retaliatory tariffs would shut that gas out of the Chinese market.\nPower\n|\nTrade truce |\nImport costs in the US fall, but development slows without certainty on tariff policies |\n|\nTrade tensions |\nLower growth reduces electricity demand; higher costs a barrier to investment |\n|\nTrade war |\nSignificant deferral of investment; battery storage the most affected sector in the US |\nThe impact of the three scenarios on electricity demand is uncertain. Slower economic growth under the trade tensions and trade war scenarios puts downward pressure on electricity consumption in many countries. However, other factors are continuing to boost demand, such as new data centres, policies to reshore manufacturing production, and goals for economic development, national security and emissions reduction.\nUnder the trade tensions and trade war scenarios, the added costs and uncertainty created by the tariffs build barriers to investment and make it more difficult to increase supply. In the US, a manufacturing renaissance has been under way, driven by policy support for industries including semiconductors and low-carbon energy. Tariffs on components and raw materials generate uncertainty over the potential to reshore more manufacturing, given the limited domestic supply of those inputs for many sectors.\nIn a business with a 5- to 10-year planning cycle, not knowing what a project will cost next year or the year after is extraordinarily disruptive. Anecdotally, many companies have been reporting adjustments to strategy and business plans, including deferrals of investments.\nUnder the trade war scenario, US battery storage is hardest hit among the generation technologies, as China dominates the supply chain. Renewables are generally more affected by tariff-driven cost increases than conventional technologies. However, the ability of new gas-fired projects to capture market share is constrained by rising costs and limited near-term manufacturing capacity growth.\nIn all scenarios, we expect development activity to slow until there is more clarity on tariff policies. Projects under construction and scheduled for completion in the will be minimally impacted due to significant inventory build-up.\nIn the trade tensions and trade war scenarios, tariffs will drive increases in the cost of electricity. Rising costs will put upward pressure on prices in power purchase agreements. Attempts at renegotiation or outright termination of existing contracts are likely.\nThe affordability of electricity gets even more scrutiny than today. In the trade war scenario, there may be an entire reset of utility investment plans through lengthy regulatory processes.\nDemand growth depends on two factors \u2013 the willingness of customers to pay increasing premiums for power and infrastructure, and the ability of utilities and developers to overcome constraints.\nThe significant cost premium for building new renewables capacity in the US compared with other countries continues to grow as the US is. The US may also be stuck with older technologies, especially when it comes to solar panels, as the rest of the world advances at a quicker pace.\nMetals and mining\n|\nTrade truce |\nLimited impact on most metals; tariffs on steel and aluminium remain |\n|\nTrade tensions |\nLower growth weighs on metals demand from manufacturing |\n|\nTrade war |\nAll projected metals growth through 2026 in the trade truce scenario wiped out |\nIn the trade truce scenario, the principal impacts of tariffs are on steel and aluminium, caught in the crossfire of US sections 232 and 301. Copper remains under review by the administration, but like all other metals, it has been exempted from US import tariffs. If this holds, the effect on most metals will be muted, with metals-intensive manufacturing activity remaining relatively robust.\nIn the trade tensions scenario, lower economic growth starts to weigh on metals demand from the manufacturing sector. With an effective 10% tariff rate, annual copper and aluminium demand falls by 300 kt and 1.5 Mt, respectively, compared with the trade truce scenario.\nThe trade war . Aluminium demand falls almost 4 Mt in 2026, with copper down 1.2 Mt, compared with our trade truce scenario. Steel demand drops by a projected 90 Mt and lithium demand by 70 kt. All projected growth through 2026 under our trade truce scenario is wiped out in a tariff war.\nChina\u2019s manufacturing export sector feels some of the worst direct impacts. Exports to markets other than the US help soften the blow, but weaker global demand for Chinese exports hammers manufacturing margins. Chinese exports flooding the global market may prove damaging for competitors, including Japan and South Korea.\nAfter 2026, recovering industrial production improves metals demand growth. There is permanent scarring, however, with demand losses still not fully recovered by 2030. This has implications for metals supply into energy transition sectors. Concerns about under-investment in mining for low-carbon technology metals subside in the near term, but are likely to be short lived. A lower price environment encourages companies to delay bringing additional supply into production as investors sit tight. Looming supply gaps soon open again after 2030, as the mining pipeline dries up and the capital investment rates required to meet demand decline.\nExplore our latest thinking in Horizons\nLoading...\nWhy sign-up?\nBy submitting your details you\u2019ll gain access to the latest Horizons report, part of a thought-leadership series exploring the themes shaping the energy natural resources landscape.

      "text": "A federal appeals court on Thursday granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nThe Trump administration had earlier told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that it would seek \"emergency relief\" from the Supreme Court as soon as Friday if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on pause.\nThe judgment issued Wednesday night by the U.S. Court of International Trade is \"temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers,\" the appeals court said in its order.\nThe pause gives the Trump administration some breathing room as it prepares to argue that the trade court's ruling should be halted for the duration of the appeals process.\nTrump officials insist that they have other options for imposing tariffs if they do not prevail in the case.\n\"Even if we lose, we will do it another way,\" Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro told reporters at the White House on Thursday afternoon.\nNonetheless, the Wednesday night ruling destabilized a pillar of Trump's economic agenda: His tariff-fueled campaign to reshape global trade.\nAlready, the ruling appeared to have weakened the Trump administration's position in a series of bilateral trade negotiations already underway.\n\"This decision is being hailed all over the World by every Country, other than the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on social media late Thursday.\n\"If allowed to stand, this would completely destroy Presidential Power \u2014 The Presidency would never be the same!\" he added, before calling the ruling, \"the harshest financial ruling ever leveled on us as a Sovereign Nation.\"\nThe three-judge trade court panel \u2014 which included a Trump appointee \u2014 invalidated all of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs and other duties.\nThe judges found that the 1970s-era law Trump had invoked to enact those tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, does not \"confer such unbounded authority\" to presidents.\nThe nationwide, permanent block they imposed covered all of the retaliatory tariffs that Trump issued in early April as part of his sweeping \"liberation day\" plan to reshape international trade with the rest of the world.\nThe ruling also barred the administration from making any future modifications to the tariffs in question. The court gave the administration 10 days to make the necessary changes to carry out the orders.\nThe government filed a notice of appeal shortly after the judgment came down. It asked the trade court to pause any enforcement of its ruling while the appeal process played out, while also seeking \"at least interim relief\" from the federal appellate court.\nThe appeals court gave the plaintiffs \u2014 a group that includes state attorneys general and a handful of domestic businesses \u2014 one week to respond to the administration's bid for a stay pending appeal. The government will then have until June 9 to reply.\nJeffrey Schwab, a lawyer for the business plaintiffs, called Thursday's pause \"a procedural step as the court considers the government's request for a longer stay pending appeal.\"\n\"We are confident the Federal Circuit will ultimately deny the government's motion shortly thereafter, recognizing the irreparable harm these tariffs inflict on our clients,\" Schwab said in a statement.\nBoth sides seem prepared for the case to advance rapidly to the nation's highest court.\n\"Hopefully, the Supreme Court will reverse this horrible, Country threatening decision, QUICKLY and DECISIVELY,\" Trump wrote Thursday."
