  "content": "One of the suspicious white-powder envelopes sent to an ICE office in Manhattan this week included a menacing note saying it was delivering \u201ckarma\u201d for migrants, law-enforcement sources told The Post.\n\nThe sinister note \u2014 found in one of five envelopes containing boric acid discovered Thursday in the ninth-floor mailroom at 26 Federal Plaza \u2014 appeared to include lyrics from the Anthrax song, \u201cA Skeleton in the Closet\u201d and bore a return address from an ICE building in Washington, DC, sources said.\n\n\u201cDeprive innocent people from their freedom and walk all over their human rights is a crime that has to be punish by men laws and divine law, nobody can escape from karma NOTE EVEN YOU,\u201d read the letter, which was viewed by The Post.\n\n\u201cTHE POWDER IS XARHTNA, WE HAVE YOUR OFEICE AIR AND YOUR FAMILY AS WELL.\u201d\n\nSources said six employees were in the room \u2014 including two within the contamination zone \u2014 when the disturbing envelopes were found, prompting authorities to swiftly evacuate the government building, also home to the US Department of Homeland Security, immigration court and other federal agencies.\n\nOfficials said there were no reported injuries.\n\nThirty-nine detainees on the floor above were relocated to New Jersey as a precaution, the source said.\n\nThe agency has come under intense heat from critics for carrying out a White House crackdown on illegal and criminal migrants.\n\n\u201cUpon receiving preliminary test results, 26 Federal Plaza was reopened last last night,\u201d a FBI New York rep said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThese preliminary test results from the crime scene, and from the New York Public Health Labs indicated there was no hazardous materials or biological toxins present.\u201d\n\nThe substance was later found to be boric acid, a chemical which can irritate the skin, cause shortness of breath if inhaled and lead to vomiting if ingested.\n\nThe tainted envelopes were sent to the FBI\u2019s Quantico lab in Virginia for further analysis as the agency launched its own probe, officials said.\n\n\u201cICE is extremely grateful to the FDNY, NYPD, FBI and FPS for their swift and decisive action to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone who was inside 26 Federal Plaza during this incident,\u201d an ICE rep said in a statement, noting the building resumed normal operations Friday.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrator(s) of this appalling crime who sought to terrorize ICE employees will not prevent us from continuing our congressionally mandated mission to preserve public safety and national security by keeping dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities in New York City and off the streets of America.\u201d",

      "text": "Feds claim jailed migrants at NYC ICE facility could use toothbrushes as \u2018weapons\u2019\nThe Justice Department is bristling at the idea of providing toothbrushes to jailed migrants at a Manhattan ICE facility \u2014 claiming the detainees could use the teeth-cleaning tools as dangerous \u201cweapons.\u201d\nManhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton\u2019s claim came after a judge ordered Wednesday that conditions in a makeshift jail at 26 Federal Plaza be improved, acting on complaints that asylum seekers have been kept in dirty, overcrowded cells.\n\u201cToothbrushes can readily be improvised as weapons,\u201d Clayton\u2019s office wrote, adding that ICE agents would prefer to continue providing migrants with \u201cteeth-cleaning wipes\u201d instead.\nThe feds did not provide an example of a migrant using a toothbrush as a weapon.\nJail inmates have fashioned the products into sharp tools in the past by shaving down the handle, but it\u2019s unclear how serious of a threat toothbrushes are, given that they can be purchased at Brooklyn\u2019s infamous Metropolitan Detention Center jail for 85 cents.\nJudge Lewis Kaplan ruled Thursday to ban toothbrushes from the site for now, pending further argument.\nThe migrants\u2019 lawyers shot back in court papers that \u201cthere is no basis to deny individuals detained at 26 Federal Plaza basic hygiene products\u201d that detainees can access at other ICE sites in the US.\nThe toothbrush debate comes as ICE agents have been photographed arresting migrants almost daily outside their mandated immigration court hearings in the same federal building.\nThe aggressive tactics drew criticism Thursday from a separate federal judge, who accused the government of playing an unconstitutional \u201cgame of detention roulette\u201d with human beings.\n\u201cTreating attendance in immigration court as a game of detention roulette is not consistent with the constitutional guarantee of due process,\u201d Judge Dale Ho wrote.\nThe jurist issued the ruling to describe why he ordered that Carlos Javier Lopez Benitez, a Paraguay native who works in construction and has no criminal record, be released from ICE custody after his arrest outside immigration court in July."

      "text": "Gov. Newsom confirms California threat to redraw congressional maps as battle with Texas, Trump heats up\nCalifornia will forge ahead with a plan to redraw its congressional district maps in a bid to give Democrats five more US House seats, a drastic move intended to neutralize a similar President Trump-backed effort underway by Texas Republicans.\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced the anticipated measure in Los Angeles Thursday with a rally-like speech, where he ranted about supposed threats to democracy in America \u2014 despite support for his own redistricting plan falling across strictly partisan lines in the heavily blue state.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\u201d Newsom said at the speech, confirming that state Democrats would soon officially declare a Nov. 4 special election to vote on the new maps.\nNewsom\u2019s plan mirrors a Trump-backed effort from Texas Gov. Greg Abbot to redraw its own congressional map and to try to win the state five more Republican US House seats \u2014 all of which is part of a wider play to help the GOP hold unto its slim 219-212 seat majority during the midterm elections.\nSome Texas Democrats have left the state to avoid a vote on the matter, with the Trump administration even dispatching the FBI to bring the AWOL representatives back home.\nFormer president Barack Obama also waded into the debate, telling Texas Democrats on a video call that he \u201clauded their fight against the Republican efforts,\u201d a spokesperson told ABC News.\n\u201cHe made clear that they are part of a bigger effort to protect free and fair elections and commended them for inspiring others with their actions,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nNewsom said California\u2019s redrawing won\u2019t take effect unless Texas goes ahead with its own, but that he was ready to greenlight the plans if provoked.\n\u201cDonald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back,\u201d said Newsom, who has been seen as a top contender to lead the Democrats\u2019 2028 presidential ticket.\nTexas\u2019 restructuring first started after a federal court\u2019s new ruling on the Voting Rights Act rendered some of the state\u2019s districts illegal in June.\nIf Texas goes ahead with its plans and California follows, similar efforts could unfold across the country in other states and dramatically reshuffle congressional seating.\nCalifornia\u2019s new map proposals are expected to be unveiled Friday.\nNewsom\u2019s announcement \u2014 held at the Japanese American National Museum in LA\u2019s Little Tokyo \u2014 took a shocking turn when about 100 armed federal agents showed up outside, apparently to carry out an immigration enforcement operation nearby, KTLA reported.\n\u201cRight outside, at this exact moment, dozens and dozens of ice agents,\u201d said Newsom, flanked by Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla. \u201cDonald Trump, you think it\u2019s coincidental?\u201d\nThe operation was led by US Border Patrol Sector Commander Gregory K. Bovino, who seemed to brush off those accusations and said at least one illegal immigrant was detained.\n\u201cBreaking the law is not coincidental,\u201d he told NBC Los Angeles. \u201cBreaking the law is breaking the law.\u201d\nWith Post wires"

      "text": "Five envelopes containing suspicious white powder discovered at NYC ICE field office, building evacuated\nFive envelopes containing a suspicious white powder were discovered at New York\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Manhattan Thursday afternoon \u2013 prompting first responders to evacuate the federal building, according to authorities.\nThe substance was later found to be boric acid, law-enforcement sources said.\nFire officials responded to 26 Federal Plaza on Foley Square just before 4 p.m. when personnel found letters containing the mysterious substance in the ninth-floor mailroom of the Jacob K. Javits Federal Office Building, officials said.\nThe historic address, also home to the US Department of Homeland Security, immigration court and other federal agencies, was swiftly evacuated as the Fire Department\u2019s hazmat teams investigated.\nThe envelopes were sent to the FBI\u2019s Quantico lab in Virginia for further analysis as the agency launched its own probe.\nThey were found to contain boric acid, which can irritate the skin, cause shortness of breath if inhaled and lead to vomiting if ingested, according to the National Pesticide Information Center.\n\u201cICE is extremely grateful to the FDNY, NYPD, FBI and FPS for their swift and decisive action to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone who was inside 26 Federal Plaza during this incident.\u201d an ICE spokeswoman told The Post in a statement Friday. \u201cThe collaborative efforts of our federal and local partners resulted in the building being cleared to open for normal operations today.\n\u201cThe perpetrator(s) of this appalling crime who sought to terrorize ICE employees will not prevent us from continuing our congressionally mandated mission to preserve public safety and national security by keeping dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities in New York City and off the streets of America. As the investigation remains ongoing, ICE defers any further comment to the FBI.\u201d\nChristopher Raia, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\u2019s New York office, told reporters during a news conference Thursday night, \u201cSending threatening letters of this nature, whether real or a hoax, is a crime.\n\u201cIt diverts valuable, limited law enforcement resources as you\u2019ve all seen tonight.\u201d\nThe shocking incident, seemingly targeting ICE\u2019s offices, comes two days after a federal judge ordered the agency to improve its immigration holding facility following complaints from jailed migrants over inhumane conditions.\nJudge Lewis A. Kaplan ruled Tuesday in a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees that the immigration agency must limit capacity, keep holding rooms clean, and provide sleeping mats in so-called hold rooms.\nThe lawsuit alleged dirty, foul-smelling, and overcrowded cells where detainees were denied soap, toothbrushes, and other basic hygiene and menstrual products.\nThe Lower Manhattan building has become a hub for arrests as the Trump administration continues its aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration.\nICE facilities and officers have been targeted by violence since the administration ramped up arrests and deportations.\nLast month, 10 members of an armed mob were charged with attempted murder after opening fire on local cops, unarmed federal agents and detention workers at the Prairieland Detention Center near Dallas, Texas.\nOne officer was shot in the neck when one suspect fired 20 to 30 rounds after the deranged group set off fireworks at the ICE facility and spray-painted cars parked at the building, according to the criminal complaint."
