  "content": "With just two days to go until its theatrical release, the first reviews for Highest 2 Lowest are in. Here\u2019s what critics have to say about the new Spike Lee movie, featuring Denzel Washington.\n\nWhen Apple, along with A24, first announced the new collaboration between legends Denzel Washington (John Q, Training Day) and Spike Lee (Do The Right Thing, BlacKkKlansman), they described the move as \u201ca reinterpretation of the great filmmaker Akira Kurosawa\u2019s crime thriller \u2018High and Low,\u2019 now played out on the mean streets of modern day New York City.\u201d\n\nGiven the star power and history behind the movie, anticipation was running high when Apple released the first teaser for it, and, just a few days ago, its official trailer, which you can watch below:\n\nNow, the first reviews are in, and if they\u2019re anything to go by, you\u2019ll probably like it, provided you\u2019re into crime thrillers, Lee, Washington, or preferably, all of the above.\n\nWith more than 45 reviews up and counting, the consensus seems to be that while the movie may not be Lee\u2019s best work, it doesn\u2019t need to be in order to offer an entertaining 133 minutes of a \u201csharp thriller fueled by tension, wit, and moral ambiguity.\u201d\n\nHere are a few highlights, both positive and negative, about what to expect:\n\u2022 IGN Movies: Begins as an austere class melodrama, but soon gives way to some of the most exciting, visceral images of Spike Lee\u2019s career.\n\u2022 Daily Telegraph (UK): Ah well: everything old is new again, and as remakes of world cinema classics go, Lee\u2019s film makes an irresistible case for its own existence.\n\u2022 Film Daze: Though it\u2019s not Lee\u2019s best, it\u2019s perhaps the busiest movie he has made, and the first in a while to recapture the ecstatic tone of 25th Hour\u2018s rapturous final moments \u2014 meaning it ultimately lands closer to the first word of its title than the last.\n\u2022 Time Out: Lee has made stunningly good crime thrillers \u2013 Clockers and 25th Hour \u2013 but like his protagonist, here he appears to be struggling to stay relevant and still use his own unique voice.\n\u2022 Vulture: Highest 2 Lowest reminds us, however clumsily, of how much the entertainment industry has shifted, with mentions of the attention economy and the internet. Then it turns around and makes a vivid argument on behalf of going out and doing what you love, whether anyone else agrees with you or not.\n\u2022 Rolling Stone: The impression is that you\u2019ve just seen a great New York movie, with a great star turn at the core of it, and yet still feels like something\u2019s missing. It\u2019s ultimately an excuse to watch Washington go HAM.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 compilation of Highest 2 Lowest reviews, you can follow this link.\n\nHighest 2 Lowest premieres in theaters August 15, and on Apple TV+ September 5.\n\nApple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Studio, The Morning Show, Shrinking and Silo.",

      "text": "Highest 2 Lowest is an old man\u2019s movie, and I don\u2019t mean that as a criticism. Spike Lee is 68 years old, and Denzel Washington is 70, and it\u2019s fitting for them to ruminate on what they\u2019ve accomplished and how they fit into a world that continues to change around them. Lee and Washington have been working together for half their lives, beginning with Mo\u2019 Better Blues in 1990. Highest 2 Lowest, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and will head to theaters in August, marks their fifth collaboration. All that shared history on screen gives their new film a metatextual poignancy \u2014 it doesn\u2019t just reunite the director and his greatest leading man, but is also centered on a character who refracts different aspects of them as artists. David King, played by Washington, is a music mogul \u2014 the hitmaker behind 50 Grammys and a man known for having \u201cthe best ears in the business.\u201d Neither he nor his label, Stackin\u2019 Hits, are as dominant as they used to be, and he\u2019s on the verge of selling the company until a change of heart prompts him instead to attempt buying back control, unable to let go of the chance to prove he can get back on top.\nFor a film that eventually finds its way to the shores of greatness, Highest 2 Lowest gets off to a bafflingly rough start. An adaptation of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 1963 High and Low, it ricochets from a corporate thriller to a crime one when David gets a call that his teenage son Trey (Aubrey Joseph) has been taken hostage, with the culprit demanding a $17.5 million ransom that will drain the funds David has borrowed and leveraged for his deal. The twist is that the kidnapper accidentally grabbed the wrong boy \u2014 Kyle (Elijah Wright), Trey\u2019s friend and the only child of his driver and right hand man Paul (Jeffrey Wright). David, who was ready to sacrifice everything he and his family have for his own kid, has to figure out whether he\u2019s willing to do the same for someone else\u2019s. It\u2019s a scenario primed for intense moral grappling, but Highest 2 Lowest turns these events into laborious, hourlong exposition. Alan Fox\u2019s script is rife with clunkers (the somnolent Ilfenesh Hadera, as David\u2019s wife Pam, explains with haunting detail which items of decor on the dining table can be moved where by the police), and the intrusive score is the equivalent of garish wall-to-wall carpeting. The glassy sleekness of the Kings\u2019 Dumbo penthouse and Manhattan offices, combined with all the shots of the skyline, makes the first act feel like a promotional video for an offering no one ever gets around to mentioning.\nThen Highest 2 Lowest takes to the streets of the city that David claims to love but has spent the last years hovering over, and it\u2019s like the movie finally begins \u2014 and when it does, it bounds forward with a thrilling vibrancy. After all that talk, a lot of it done by David to himself, Highest 2 Lowest plunges into a subway setpiece that combines a ransom dropoff with the Puerto Rican Day Parade and a Yankees game. The nail-biting suspense of the mission blurs into the joyous bustle to the point where the movie itself is equal parts dread and celebration. Things kick into another gear entirely when A$AP Rocky, also known as Rakim Mayers, turns up as Yung Felon, an aspiring rapper who planned this wild act of extortion out of resentment, admiration, and desperation. Mayers has acted a few times before, in the 2018 indie Monster and this year\u2019s Sundance favorite If I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You, but his turn in Highest 2 Lowest really makes the case that movie stardom is his if he wants it. His scenes are all with Washington, who he manages to jolt fresh energy out of, as the two face off in sequences that are part rap battle, part therapy session.\nIt\u2019s when Mayers turns up that Highest 2 Lowest feels like it actually settles on what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s a film full of sons \u2014 like Trey, David\u2019s thoroughbred successor raised in comfort and without the tensions his father experienced in youth, and Kyle, the godson that David\u2019s helped take care of but has to decide how much he owes. Yung Felon, who David hasn\u2019t met until the kidnapping sets them on a collision course, turns out to be another sort of son, because he\u2019s built David up in his mind as a surrogate absentee father, a figure whose attention he\u2019s been longing for, and who sees him as a potential savior as well as a foe to be defeated. Highest 2 Lowest is about legacy \u2014 about what you owe the audience you\u2019ve cultivated, and what you owe yourself. Both Lee and Washington are enormously influential figures who still have plenty of working years ahead of them, but like David, they have to figure out whether that time is best spent chasing what\u2019s successful or what\u2019s of interest to them. Highest 2 Lowest reminds us, however clumsily, of how much the entertainment industry has shifted, with mentions of the attention economy and the internet. Then it turns around and makes a vivid argument on behalf of going out and doing what you love, whether anyone else agrees with you or not. It\u2019s an assertion made as much with images as with words \u2014 a fan leading a chant about Boston sucking on the stalled train, a performance from Eddie Palmieri and the Salsa Orchestra, and Washington nodding along to a singer he loves, proving you\u2019re only as old as you feel.\nMore From the 2025 Cannes Film Festival\n- Ari Aster\u2019s Eddington Is Bracingly Nasty and Unsure of What It\u2019s Trying to Say\n- The 11 Best Movies We Saw at Cannes This Year\n- All the Films Sold at Cannes 2025"

I would definitely recommend!\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2025Color: Midnight Aluminum Case with Ink Sport LoopSize: 40mm Case + Small/Medium bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseWhy did you pick this product vs others?:\nAfter having some problems with my Fitbit Charge 5, I decided to move up to the Apple Watch. I don\u2019t want a lot of the fancy whistles and bells, just a way to monitor my exercise program. This model satisfies my needs perfectly.\n- Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2024Color: Midnight Aluminum Case with Ink Sport LoopSize: 40mm Case + Small/Medium bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseUPDATE:\nAfter using my watch extensively for two months I changed my review rating to a five. Why? Because it is absolutely essential for keeping track of my daily/weekly/monthly diet and fitness. I think it keeps me focused more in my goals by offering so many functions. The fitness rings are super for keeping up with calories, exercise and standing. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to disappoint the watch by not reaching my goals. Yes, that does sound odd but so far it works. I got it for a great price too. I\u2019ve become accustomed to charging my watch in the evenings so I can use it to monitor my sleep. I imagine a higher priced version would hold a charge longer. I\u2019ve previously used knock off fitness watches but they don\u2019t come close to what my Apple Watch can do, plus it syncs to my phone.\nI\u2019m 70 years old so keeping myself as healthy as I can is really really important.\nINITIAL REVIEW:\nI\u2019m delighted with my Apple Watch. I got it after I finally traded in my wonderful but very old IPhone 8 for an exceptional IPhone 15 pro max. The functions are exceptional and I use it a lot. One thing, the battery doesn\u2019t last very long. It needs a charge before the end of each day. It\u2019s fine but I\u2019m a bit disappointed that Apple can\u2019t figure that out after producing the watch for such a long time. Gee.\n- Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024Color: Midnight Aluminum Case with Ink Sport LoopSize: 40mm Case + Small/Medium bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseI got this for my wife as an anniversary gift. She was needing a new fitness tracker/watch and since she has an iPhone I figured an Apple Watch would be a great upgrade from her old fitness tracker. The watch was packaged very well and neatly. The band it came with is of good quality and easy to adjust. The watch screen is responsive and easy to read. When setting up the watch we were going back and forth with updates and problems because this watch requires firmware 18.xx and we have iPhone 13. So to get it to work we had to manually update the phone to that firmware. Nearly sent it back for that reason. Once it\u2019s setup the amount functions and features is a bit overwhelming for a first time user and will take some time to figure all of it out. So far the battery life is pretty bad compared to past smart watches. Has to charged daily otherwise it will die halfway through the second day of use. It is a great looking watch though.\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2025Color: Midnight Aluminum Case with Ink Sport LoopSize: 40mm Case + Small/Medium bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseI love this watch! I switched to the Apple Watch SE from the Fitbit Sense, which had cost about the same amount. The advantages of the Apple Watch are huge! The Apple SE shows everything I need to see on a clear informative watch screen. On the Fitbit, I spent a lot of time each day syncing the watch to the app, and going to the app to see sleep and fitness analysis, not displayed on the watch. The Apple watch is always \"synced\", invisibly and reliably. The Apple SE comes with a magnetic charger, also available on many generic phone charging stands. My old Fitbit was a royal pain to keep charged. The spring contacts on the charger failed to make contact, and after several hours, I'd come back to find the watch had not charged at all. I had to buy a new charging cable 4 times in its 3 years of use. The Apple SE not only shows sleep and fitness information on the watch screen, but can provide alerts from my home security system, email, social apps, checking accounts, calendar apps... wow! The only thing I had to use the iPhone app for was to set up my watch face, and unlike the Fitbit which lost my watch face setting every time the OS updated, everything on the Apple SE is stable. It JUST WORKS AND COMMUNICATES. As much as I use these features, the Apple SE is a life-changer!\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2025Color: Midnight Aluminum Case with Ink Sport LoopSize: 40mm Case + Small/Medium bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseGreat quality coming from Apple as well as the charging speed when you\u2019re in a pinch.

      "text": "Akira Kurosawa\u2019s High and Low is the kind of film you watch in a state of quasi-paralysis. The 1963 noir is both taut moral thriller and enthralling procedural \u2014 a film of relentless jaw-clenching tension and compulsive rhythm that sets the bar for everything it does.\nIn short, it\u2019s a masterpiece, and so it was always going to be tough for anyone to replicate its magic with a remake, even for a filmmaker of Spike Lee\u2019s stature. So Lee has approached the challenge the only way that gives his Highest 2 Lowest a chance of stepping out from under the shadow of its predecessor: by making it entirely, irrefutably, his own.\nThat much is apparent from the swoony opening scene, a marked subversion of the bitter cynicism that runs through Kurosawa\u2019s film. In a heads-up that Lee will swap the claustrophobia of High and Low\u2018s interiors and celebrate the expansiveness of his beloved New York, Highest 2 Lowest begins with a sweeping drone shot of the city at sunrise set to a crooning version of \u201cOh What a Beautiful Mornin'\u201d, the gleaming neon skyscraper signs all beaming \u201cWELCOME\u201d at us.\nThat mood virtually never breaks \u2014 even when the central drama kicks off. In their (allegedly final) collaboration, Lee has cast Denzel Washington in a spin on Toshiro Mifune\u2019s original role as a corporate executive whose son is the target of a kidnapping plot. Where Mifune\u2019s Gondo was in the shoe business, Washington\u2019s David King is the head of Stackin\u2019 Hits Records, a music label on the verge of a handsome acquisition by an outfit he worries will \u201csqueeze every drop of Black culture\u201d out of it. David isn\u2019t quite ready to retire quietly and see his life\u2019s work go down like this, so we catch him on the eve of an audacious plan to buy out shareholders and reassert the dominance his surname implies. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk, it\u2019s a rebirth,\u201d he tells his sceptical wife Pam (Ilfanesh Hadera), revealing that he\u2019s remortgaged their homes to finance what appears to be a midlife crisis. But hours later, those plans are put on pause by an anonymous phone call he receives revealing that their son Trey (Aubrey Joseph) has been kidnapped for the tidy ransom of 17.5 million Swiss francs (around $21 million).\nThe moment is oddly anticlimactic, a vacuum of tension that tips us off that Lee\u2019s attentions are elsewhere. Because this isn\u2019t really a movie about a fumbled kidnapping, in which the son (Elijah Wright) of David\u2019s chauffeur Paul (Jeffrey Wright) is mistaken for David\u2019s teenager. Highest 2 Lowest is a film about getting your mojo back when everyone else has written you off, about fatherhood and Black art, about how there\u2019s nowhere else in the world like New York, and about how much Spike Lee loves the Knicks.\nIt\u2019s the enthusiasm Lee has for those things \u2014 and the lightning-fast dynamism with which he toggles between them \u2014 that allows the film\u2019s disparate focuses to coalesce. Whenever you start to worry that he\u2019s lost his touch (that non-event of an inciting incident, several bum acting notes, or the often-uninspired cinematography), Lee spins your head with an electric switch-up of tone that reaffirms your belief in him.\nCase in point: the handover of the ransom, which takes place on the day of the city\u2019s Puerto Rican parade and coincides with a Yankees game. For a few minutes, we virtually forget about the kidnapping: Lee hurls us headfirst into the buzzy atmospheres of both game day and the parade as Washington\u2019s character travels to the drop-off point via the subway, raucous chants of \u201cLet\u2019s go Yankees! Boston sucks!\u201d and a live performance of Eddie Palmieri\u2019s Salsa Orchestra flushing his plight from our memory through sheer aural power. There are cameos from Anthony Ramos and Do the Right Thing\u2018s Rosie Perez to further pivot our attention away from the movie\u2019s plot, and Lee even has Nick Turturro appeal directly to us with a passionate Yankees chant delivered straight down Matthew Libatique\u2019s camera.\nIt\u2019s a radiant, manic scene, one that should almost derail this ostensible thriller \u2014 but it works. In fact, the film might not work without it: both audience and movie are fully energised by the time it\u2019s over, and the central drama gets some much-needed invigoration. What follows doesn\u2019t always hit the mark, as Washington\u2019s character over-indulges in fatherly moralising and Lee insists on the upbeat resolution of David\u2019s midlife crisis right till the end. But the film is alive from this point on, especially when David and Paul track down the kidnapper, a (literally) underground rapper played with convincing bitterness by A$AP Rocky. In Rocky\u2019s scenes, the film swerves into new territory again: on first meeting, for example, the duo face off in a rap battle, and a later confrontation is shot like a music video (video vixens included).\nIt\u2019s in moments like these that Highest 2 Lowest really sings. The movie\u2019s open-hearted sincerity can mean it verges on idealistic at times, but it also gives rise to blasts of virtuosic filmmaking and some genuinely affecting moments. It\u2019s a film steeped in the things the director clearly cares deeply about: basketball, New York City, and Black American art and culture (Basquiat, James Brown, Aretha, Ali, and Stevie Wonder all getting their moments in the spotlight). It does have its tongue-in-cheek moments (smack-talking the Red Sox, a wink at A24), but Highest 2 Lowest is so obviously driven by pure, unbridled love for all the things Lee celebrates that it\u2019s impossible not to be moved by it. Though it\u2019s not his best, it\u2019s perhaps the busiest movie the director has made, and the first in a while to recapture the ecstatic tone of 25th Hour\u2018s rapturous final moments \u2014 meaning it ultimately lands closer to the first word of its title than the last."

      "text": "Highest 2 Lowest opens in theaters Friday, August 22, before streaming on Apple TV+ on Friday, September 5. This review is based on a screening at the Cannes Film Festival.\nSpike Lee can shift tones mid-movie like few other directors \u2013 and in Highest 2 Lowest, he swings that pendulum as hard as he possibly can. Based on Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 1963 crime drama High and Low (as well as its inspiration, the novel King\u2019s Ransom by Ed McBain), it\u2019s a curious melodrama that evolves in fascinating ways and boasts a tremendous lead performance from Lee\u2019s long-time collaborator Denzel Washington. To say that the pair still has it after all these years and all their successes together and apart would be a massive understatement.\nIt might not seem that way at first, though. Highest 2 Lowest\u2019s story of kidnapping, class, and moral dilemmas takes Lee back to New York City, his hometown and the setting for some of the most vital entries in his filmography. (Do the Right Thing and 25th Hour, to name a couple.) But the vibrancy the city lends those movies takes a while to emerge in this one, which opens within the comfy, cushy Brooklyn penthouse of record producer David King (Washington). This is by design, though it can be concerning, given Highest 2 Lowest\u2019s initially stilted quality and the sensory assault of Howard Drossin\u2019s ceaseless, oppressive soap-opera piano score.\nIf the action in the early goings ever moves from these ritzy confines \u2013 adorned with expensive artwork depicting Black history and pop culture from Lee\u2019s own collection, and magazine covers highlighting King\u2019s achievements \u2013 it\u2019s to show that this is a tale of two New Yorks. In the one occupied by the main character, he glides by the riff raff on the sidewalks in a luxury SUV. Even something as simple as an establishing shot of a long line of police cars, arriving as soon as King calls them to report the apparent kidnapping of his teenage son, speaks to how the city bends to his will. That the child being held for an eight figure ransom is actually the son of King\u2019s less well-to-do driver, Paul Christopher (Jeffrey Wright), puts this split into focus \u2013 as does the loaded question of whether or not King will still pay to save the kid.\nHowever, as soon as he\u2019s forced back to his old Bronx neighborhood by the kidnapper (played by A$AP Rocky), Highest 2 Lowest undergoes a radical transformation, resulting in some of the most electric filmmaking of Lee\u2019s career. King is thrust into the other New York in a sequence modeled after the breathless chase of another Big Apple classic, The French Connection, winding through crowded streets during a Puerto Rico Day parade and into the subway on a train full of fans headed to Yankee Stadium. It\u2019s here that Drossin\u2019s score accelerates, becoming propulsive rather than plodding. The fabric of the visuals \u2013 courtesy of cinematographer Matthew Libatique \u2013 goes from cold and austere to sweltering and more textured, with all the film grain and cin\u00e9ma verit\u00e9 of a classic, grimy New York indie. This sequence proves that Lee is no King, who strives to show that money and influence haven\u2019t diluted his talent and authenticity. The director has neither missed a step, nor lost touch with the city.\nWithin this look at modern Black affluence and its contradictions, and what it means to make it in America while stepping on other people\u2019s backs, Lee roots the more intimate drama in King\u2019s relationship with his right-hand man. Christopher is King\u2019soldest friend and loyal confidant, whose prison stint and conversion to Islam make him an immediate target of police suspicion. Wright makes himself appropriately small in the role, ceding space to Washington in a story of how wealth consumes everyone in its vicinity. This has the added effect of allowing Washington the room to turn his ethical conundrum into captivating, Shakespearean soliloquy.\nIf there was any doubt that Washington ought to be considered one of screen\u2019s greatest performers, Highest 2 Lowest should permanently put them to rest. He crafts an entire history of struggle and ambition through mere glances and fleeting exchanges nestled amidst his showy bombast. As the film goes on, his ego takes center stage in a manner befitting King Lear \u2013 that is, until Lee also decides to capitalize on Washington\u2019s action-star charisma, for a thrilling final act that culminates in a viscerally exciting and explosively entertaining confrontation across the glass divide of a recording booth.\nLee hasn\u2019t merely spun a distinctly New York story with Highest 2 Lowest: It\u2019s also one of modern technology, social media, and parasocial relationships of which King is blissfully unaware \u2013 until he becomes its victim. It\u2019s a film through which Lee confronts accusations that he\u2019s out of touch, by shaping a character who\u2019s been slowly removed from his own culture and history by wealth and success, until he\u2019s forced back in by circumstances beyond his control (and in many ways, of his own making). The more Lee opens up the world beneath King\u2019s ivory tower, the more he reveals a despondent reality, sketched in hues of fury and despair, forcing him to take stock of the world he\u2019s left behind."

Eighteen years after their last collaboration, the two continue to bring out the best in each other\u2014no matter that, in this case, Lee perhaps goes a tad overboard on his end.\nFull Review | Aug 13, 2025\nThere\u2019s a certain level of calmness that may come from a director working with his most successful on-screen collaborator (for the fifth time), which speaks to where they both are in life.\nFull Review | Aug 13, 2025\nHighest 2 Lowest becomes a movie about a powerful man struggling against gravitational pull, and maybe rediscovering his scrappiness in the process.\nFull Review | Original Score: 7.9/10 | Aug 13, 2025\nThe film is a love letter to a trifecta of things its director adores: New York City, director Akira Kurosawa, and Denzel Washington.\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Aug 13, 2025\nDenzel Washington gives an Oscar-caliber performance as a powerful music executive facing a deadly moral dilemma. Highest 2 Lowest continues to prove why Washington is arguably the best actor of his generation.\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Aug 13, 2025\nHighest 2 Lowest features an unprecedented performance from Denzel Washington, impressive cinematography, and fantastic music. However, the story is so shackled to safe and expected circumstances that it tethers the film to certain mediocrity.\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Aug 12, 2025\nThe director\u2019s desire to show off New York in all of its sweltering, swarming diversity has rarely been so palpable, and the city plays itself with aplomb.\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Aug 12, 2025\nWashington and Rocky\u2019s scenes are flat-out electric.\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Aug 12, 2025\nThe more the film diverges from Kurosawa\u2019s, the more confident and distinguished it becomes.\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Aug 12, 2025\nDenzel: he\u2019s one name now. He can do no wrong. Even with Jeffrey Wright seriously trying to pull attention as the second banana, Denzel knows to pay out his charms slowly. By the time he builds to a crescendo, you see what greatness on film can be.\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Aug 12, 2025\nHighest 2 Lowest is a New York City love letter from Spike Lee that also reunites him with Denzel Washington.\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Aug 12, 2025\nA rousing and captivating, but tonally uneven crime thriller.\nFull Review | Aug 12, 2025\nHighest 2 Lowest is another visionary turn from Spike Lee, with a lot to say amidst excellent performances from Denzel and Jeffrey Wright. It feels less focused at the end, but it\u2019s still an exceptional example of Spike Lee\u2019s talents.\nFull Review | Aug 12, 2025\nHalfway through, 'Highest 2 Lowest' became riveting, but overall it's sporadically entertaining, often boring, sometimes engrossing, and sometimes rather silly.\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Aug 12, 2025\nSpike Lee\u2019s Highest 2 Lowest is more remix than remake, a slick, sharp thriller fueled by tension, wit, and moral ambiguity. Lee blends gripping suspense with his signature cinematic flair, delivering a film that pulses with urgency and swagger.\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Aug 11, 2025\nIs this Spike exercising Schumerian/Jefferiesian finger-wag (the doleful cinema of the strongly worded letter) or sending up same? Six, one. Half-dozen, other. Knicks game at 7!\nFull Review | Aug 8, 2025\nBegins as an austere class melodrama, but soon gives way to some of the most exciting, visceral images of Spike Lee\u2019s career.\nFull Review | Original Score: 9/10 | Jul 8, 2025\nThis fifth Lee-Washington collaboration is the sort of luxurious gloss-and-grit thriller that was once a studio staple back in the brontosaurus-infested swamps of the late 20th century...\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jun 16, 2025\nThough it\u2019s not Lee's best, it\u2019s perhaps the busiest movie he has made, and the first in a while to recapture the ecstatic tone of 25th Hour\u2018s rapturous final moments \u2014 meaning it ultimately lands closer to the first word of its title than the last.\nFull Review | Jun 12, 2025\nThe thriller is the pretext that maintains the intrigue, but the most interesting aspect of the film are the footnotes, the ironic asides, and the twilight gaze that moves between the images.

It counts your steps, measures your exercise time, your heart rate, your run and walk pace and all that great stuff.\nAt first the bands the watch came with were a tight fit, so I just purchased a different band that fit my wrist more comfortably.

Although there was nothing critically wrong with my lovely blue Series 6, I loved the shiny jet-black finish of the new watch. First impressions after a few weeks are, wow - well worth the upgrade! The 10 is more comfortable, feels lighter and with my large wrists, seems better balanced. Battery life in comparison to my older 6 is phenomenal, I can go two days without looking for a charge. Obviously, if I am doing more activities, the battery life diminishes, but on an average day of 18 hours of wrist-time, I'm typically seeing about 50% charge at day's end.\nMany make a big deal over the Blood Oxygen not being part of the health software suite.

Overall it functions how I need belong to track my health with the fitness function and I love that you can track sleep and your heart.Great, reliable, easy watch!\nReviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025\nImages in this review\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025Color: Silver Aluminium Case with Denim Sport BandSize: 46mm case + Medium/Large bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseDidn't think I would ever get a smartwatch. Too much big brother stuff going on with them. Didn't want to be inundated with alerts about everything from stress levels to heart rate etc. Most of that you can turn off if you want to ( and I do and so did ).\nHOWEVER... based on the recommendation of my daughter I got one for me to use while on my bicycle to get via Siri updates on weather, time (obviously), without having to take out my phone while riding 15+ mph. The apple watch has lots of great features, awesome bands (separate purchase), is darn lightweight and simply works.\nBattery life is good even when on an hours long bike ride where the watch is tracking my exercise activity. Easy to charge and fast to charge as well.\nI highly recommend it after years for fighting against one.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2025Color: Jet Black Aluminium Case with Black Sport BandSize: 46mm case + Medium/Large bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseI upgraded from my Apple Watch Series 7 to the new Series 10, and I\u2019m really glad I did. The bigger display is gorgeous\u2014bright, sharp, and easy to read even in direct sunlight\u2014and the slimmer, lighter design makes it more comfortable for all-day wear. I went with the 46mm Jet Black Aluminium Case and Ink Sport Loop, and the band is lightweight, breathable, and stays comfortable whether I\u2019m at the gym, in the office, or out cycling.\nHealth and fitness tracking has definitely stepped up. The heart rate monitoring, ECG, and sleep tracking all work smoothly, and the new sleep apnea detection is a thoughtful bonus. I don\u2019t need constant alerts for everything, so I turned off the notifications I don\u2019t care about and kept the ones I find useful\u2014like weather updates or workout stats during a bike ride. It\u2019s nice to have that flexibility.\nPerformance is fast and responsive thanks to the new chip, and the integration with my iPhone is seamless. I can check messages, take calls, or get Siri updates without touching my phone\u2014super handy when riding at 15+ mph. Battery life is solid, lasting a day and a half for me, and the fast charging is no joke\u2014about 80% in half an hour.\nOn top of all that, the durability is reassuring (crack resistant, dust resistant, and water resistant), and the fact that it\u2019s carbon neutral with certain bands is a nice touch.\nIf you\u2019ve been on the fence about smartwatches like I was, this one might win you over. It\u2019s stylish, packed with genuinely useful features, and just works. Highly recommended."

      "text": "It\u2019s never a good sign when you\u2019re not sure if a film is supposed to be funny. There are moments in Spike Lee\u2019s new take on the classic Akira Kurosawa 1963 crime drama High and Low (which itself was based on Ed McBain\u2019s novel King\u2019s Ransom) where I felt genuinely baffled as to whether I was watching a moment of Police Squad! parody or a fumbled episode of Law & Order. The results are sporadically entertaining, sometimes riveting, sometimes dull and sometimes just plain silly.\nDenzel Washington plays a king of New York: David King, the founder and executive of a record company which is in the process of a hostile takeover when he decides to throw his entire fortune into securing a controlling share. At which point, his son Kyle gets kidnapped and he is asked for $17.5 million, a sum that would wipe him out. When the cops show up to help out, King gets impatient at their apparent lackadaisical approach: \u2018Haven\u2019t you watched SVU?\u2019 he asks.\nRather than heighten the stakes, the twists only seem to lower them\nThe twists and turns that follow only seem to lower the stakes, rather than heighten them. Spike Lee throws in all his enthusiasms: Brooklyn gets A-to-Z namechecked, along with his baseball and basketball teams and rivalries. King\u2019s job allows him to riff on music. He consults the portraits of musical icons on his office wall for advice: \u2018What would you do, Jimi? What would you do, Aretha?\u2019 Luckily, he hadn\u2019t signed Diddy.\nThere are also a bunch of strange directorial choices here. We\u2019ll see a handshake or a kiss twice, editing repetitions that presumably reference the \u20182\u2019 in the title (which by the way, makes the film sound like a sequel). Sometimes scene changes have an animation of the company\u2019s record logo; sometimes they don\u2019t. Lee\u2019s creative team isn\u2019t blameless in the film\u2019s raggedy feel: long-time composer Howard Drossin\u2019s soundtrack is interminable and spends a lot of time sounding like an Irish jig. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique, meanwhile, shoots New York lovingly, but also drops in what can only be described as a Super 8 filter when indicating memories which took place way back in 2019.\nThreads of the story are left dangling and ambiguities which could have been richly explored about wealth and inequality are shied away from, one suspects, in service of Denzel\u2019s unblemished heroic status. The subtext of the film is about how legends of black culture \u2013 Denzel and Spike among them \u2013 struggle to maintain their legacy in the face of ageing and a changing world. Watching his face-off with a kidnapper played by A$AP Rocky devolve into a literal rap battle is bonkers and fun. It\u2019s a scene from the best of the six or so movies that Spike Lee seems to be cramming into this one.\nLee has made stunningly good crime thrillers \u2013 Clockers and 25th Hour \u2013 but like his protagonist, here he appears to be struggling to stay relevant and still use his own unique voice.\nIn US theaters Aug 15. Streaming on Apple TV+ Sep 5."

I have bumped the watch face a few times with no protective cover and there\u2019s no dents, scratches or cracks. Overall it functions how I need belong to track my health with the fitness function and I love that you can track sleep and your heart.Great, reliable, easy watch!\nReviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025\nImages in this review\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025Color: Silver Aluminium Case with Denim Sport BandSize: 46mm case + Medium/Large bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseDidn't think I would ever get a smartwatch. Too much big brother stuff going on with them. Didn't want to be inundated with alerts about everything from stress levels to heart rate etc. Most of that you can turn off if you want to ( and I do and so did ).\nHOWEVER... based on the recommendation of my daughter I got one for me to use while on my bicycle to get via Siri updates on weather, time (obviously), without having to take out my phone while riding 15+ mph. The apple watch has lots of great features, awesome bands (separate purchase), is darn lightweight and simply works.\nBattery life is good even when on an hours long bike ride where the watch is tracking my exercise activity. Easy to charge and fast to charge as well.\nI highly recommend it after years for fighting against one.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2025Color: Jet Black Aluminium Case with Black Sport BandSize: 46mm case + Medium/Large bandStyle: GPSConfiguration: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseI upgraded from my Apple Watch Series 7 to the new Series 10, and I\u2019m really glad I did. The bigger display is gorgeous\u2014bright, sharp, and easy to read even in direct sunlight\u2014and the slimmer, lighter design makes it more comfortable for all-day wear. I went with the 46mm Jet Black Aluminium Case and Ink Sport Loop, and the band is lightweight, breathable, and stays comfortable whether I\u2019m at the gym, in the office, or out cycling.\nHealth and fitness tracking has definitely stepped up. The heart rate monitoring, ECG, and sleep tracking all work smoothly, and the new sleep apnea detection is a thoughtful bonus. I don\u2019t need constant alerts for everything, so I turned off the notifications I don\u2019t care about and kept the ones I find useful\u2014like weather updates or workout stats during a bike ride. It\u2019s nice to have that flexibility.\nPerformance is fast and responsive thanks to the new chip, and the integration with my iPhone is seamless. I can check messages, take calls, or get Siri updates without touching my phone\u2014super handy when riding at 15+ mph. Battery life is solid, lasting a day and a half for me, and the fast charging is no joke\u2014about 80% in half an hour.\nOn top of all that, the durability is reassuring (crack resistant, dust resistant, and water resistant), and the fact that it\u2019s carbon neutral with certain bands is a nice touch.\nIf you\u2019ve been on the fence about smartwatches like I was, this one might win you over. It\u2019s stylish, packed with genuinely useful features, and just works. Highly recommended."

      "text": "Akira Kurosawa\nKurosawa got his start in films following an education which included study of Western painting, literature and political philosophy. His early films were made under the stringent auspices of the militaristic government then in power and busily engaged in waging the Pacific war. While one can detect aspects of the pro-war ideology in early works like \"The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail\" (1945) or, more especially, \"Sanshiro Sugata\" (1943), these films are notable more for stylistic experimentation than pro-war inspiration.Before he had a chance to mature under these conditions, though, Kurosawa, like all of Japan, experienced the American occupation. Under its auspices he produced pro-democracy films, the most appealing of which is \"No Regrets for Our Youth\" (1946), interestingly his only film which has a woman as its primary protagonist. His ability to make films that could please Japanese militarists or American occupiers should not be taken as either cultural schizophrenia or political fence-sitting, for at their best these early films have a minimal value as propaganda, and tend to reveal early glimpses of the major themes which would dominate his cinema. His style, too, is an amalgam, a deft dialectic of the great pictorial traditions of the silent cinema, the dynamism of the Soviet cinema (perhaps embodied in the Japanese-Russian friendship dramatized in his \"Dersu Uzala\" 1975) and the Golden Age of Hollywood filmmaking (which explains how easily his work has been remade by American directors). Above all, Kurosawa is a modern filmmaker, portraying (in films from \"Drunken Angel\" 1948 to \"Rhapsody in August\" 1991) the ethical and metaphysical dilemmas characteristic of postwar culture, the world of the atomic bomb, which has rendered certainty and dogma absurd. The consistency at the heart of Kurosawa's work is his exploration of the concept of heroism. Whether portraying the world of the wandering swordsman, the intrepid policeman or the civil servant, Kurosawa focuses on men faced with ethical and moral choices. The choice of action suggests that Kurosawa's heroes share the same dilemma as Albert Camus' existential protagonists--Kurosawa did adapt Dostoevsky's existential novel \"The Idiot\" in 1951 and saw the novelist as a key influence in all his work--but for Kurosawa the choice is to act morally, to work for the betterment of one's fellow men.Perhaps because Kurosawa experienced the twin devastations of the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 and WWII, his cinema focuses on times of chaos. From the destruction of the glorious Heian court society that surrounds the world of \"Rashomon\" (1950) to the never-ending destruction of the civil war era of the 16th century that gives \"The Seven Samurai\" (1954) its dramatic impetus, to the savaged Tokyo in the wake of US bombing raids in \"Drunken Angel\" (1948), to the ravages of the modern bureaucratic mind-set that pervade \"Ikiru\" (1952) and \"The Bad Sleep Well\" (1960): Kurosawa's characters are situated in periods of metaphysical eruption, threatened equally by moral destruction and physical annihilation; in a world of existential alienation in which God is dead and nothing is certain. But it is his hero who, living in a world of moral chaos, in a vacuum of ethical and behavioral standards, nevertheless chooses to act for the public good.Kurosawa was dubbed \"Japan's most Western director\" by critic Donald Richie at a time when few Westerners had seen many of the director's films and at a time when the director was in what should have been merely the middle of his career. Richie felt that Kurosawa was Western in the sense of being an original creator, as distinct from doing the more rigidly generic or formulaic work of many Japanese directors during the height of Kurosawa's creativity. And indeed some of the director's best work can be read as \"sui generis,\" drawing upon individual genius such as few filmmakers in the history of world cinema have. \"Rashomon,\" \"Ikiru\" and \"Record of a Living Being\" (1955) challenge easy classification and are stunning in their originality of style, theme and setting.Furthermore, Kurosawa's attractions to the West were apparent in both content and form. His adaptations from Western literature, although not unique in Japanese cinema, are among his finest films, with \"Throne of Blood\" (1957, from \"Macbeth\") and \"Ran\" (1985, from \"King Lear\") standing among the finest versions of Shakespeare ever put on film. And if Western high culture obviously appealed to him, so did more popular, even pulp forms, as evinced by critically acclaimed adaptations of Dashiell Hammett's \"Red Harvest\" to fashion \"Yojimbo\" (1961) and Ed McBain's \"King's Ransom\" to create the masterful \"High and Low\" (1962). Of course such borrowings show not only the richness of Kurosawa's thinking and his work but also just how notions of \"genius\" require a complex understanding of the contexts in which the artist works.Indeed, for all of the Western adaptations and the attraction to Hollywood and Soviet-style montage, Kurosawa's status as a Japanese filmmaker can never be doubted. If, as has often been remarked, his period films have similarities with Hollywood westerns, they are nevertheless accurately drawn from the turmoil of Japanese history. If he has been attracted to Shakespearean theater, he has equally been drawn to the rarefied world of Japanese Noh drama. And if Kurosawa is a master of dynamic montage, he is equally the master of the Japanese trademarks of the long take and gracefully mobile camera.Thus to see Kurosawa as somehow a \"Western\" filmmaker is not only to ignore the traditional bases for much of his style and many of his themes, but to do a disservice to the nature of film style and culture across national boundaries. Kurosawa's cinema may be taken as paradigmatic of the nature of modern changing Japan, of how influences from abroad are adapted, transformed and made new by the genius of the Japanese national character, which remains distinctive yet ever-changing. And if Kurosawa tends to focus on an individual hero, a man forced to choose a mode of behavior and a pattern of action in the modern Western tradition of the loner-hero, it is only in recognition of global culture that increasingly centralizes, bureaucratizes and dehumanizes."
