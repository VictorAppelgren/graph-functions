  "content": "Optimove Insights survey of 1,066 consumers also reveals widespread concerns about inflation, highlighting the need for empathetic and responsive marketing strategies\n\nNew York, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Optimove Insights, the research and analysis arm of Optimove, today released new findings showing that American consumers are increasingly concerned about the impact of tariffs on their spending power. Data from Optimove Insights' surveys of 1,066 US consumers aged 18\u201365 with household incomes over $75,000 on summer, back-to-school, and pre-holiday shopping periods revealed a consistent theme: more than 81.4% of shoppers are worried about tariffs, and 80.5% are concerned about inflation.\n\nOptimove, the creator of Positionless Marketing, frees marketing teams from the limitations of fixed roles, giving every marketer the power to execute any marketing task instantly and independently. Its platform is used by leading global B2C brands.\n\n\u201cThese findings are a wake-up call for marketers,\u201d said Pini Yakuel, CEO of Optimove. \u201cNow more than ever, consumers feel economic pressures. Marketers need agility and empathy to respond in real time. Brands must acknowledge financial anxiety through supportive, empathetic messaging.\u201d\n\nSurvey results also revealed that while consumers are anxious, many remain willing to spend if presented with value and trust-driven engagement. Irrelevant messaging leads to fatigue and missed opportunities.\n\nYakuel added, \u201cBrands that cannot listen to consumers\u2019 needs and wants and respond in real time will appear tone-deaf.
