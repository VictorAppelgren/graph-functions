He had earlier also reached a $15 million defamation settlement with ABC.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s call for the Federal Communications Commission to reconsider broadcasting licenses marks an escalation in his criticism of news networks, although it\u2019s unclear whether the president has any legal authority to pursue such an action.\n\nABC belongs to Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), while NBC is a unit of Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA).\n\nTrump lashes out at NBC, ABC, threatens licenses over \u2018biased\u2019 coverage\n\nThese Under-the-Radar Stocks Offer Better Risk-Reward Ratio Than Nvidia\n\nAfter soaring 149%, this stock is back in our AI\u2019s favor - & already +25% in July",

      "text": "Asia stocks soar amid growing US rate cut bets, China tech rally\n- Nvidia just crossed $4 trillion\u2014but how much higher can it go?\n- The Magnificent 7 are still strong, but upside looks limited from here.\n- If you\u2019re hunting for the next breakout star, it may be time to look beyond the giants.\n- Looking for more actionable trade ideas? Subscribe now to unlock access to InvestingPro\u2019s AI-selected stock winners for up to 50% off amid the summer sale.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the first company in the world to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization during yesterday\u2019s trading session, as the stock hit a new all-time high of $164.42. Since bottoming in April\u2014during peak market anxiety over Trump\u2019s tariffs\u2014Nvidia has now rebounded by over 88%.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that yesterday was marked by renewed tariff concerns following major new announcements from Donald Trump. However, slightly dovish Fed Minutes released later in the day helped lift investor sentiment during the second half of the session.\nCompared with the start of the year, Nvidia has posted a gain of over 21%, making it the second-best performer among the Magnificent 7, behind Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\nHowever, this performance marks a clear slowdown compared to last year\u2019s 171% surge, or the 239% increase recorded in 2023. Moreover, both analysts and valuation models suggest limited further upside for Nvidia at current levels.\nThe same applies to most of the Magnificent 7, which have all shown strong upward trends over the past three months, but also appear to have limited potential based on analysts\u2019 outlooks and the InvestingPro Fair Value model, which aggregates several recognized valuation frameworks:\nSource: InvestingPro\nNvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) currently show negative potential according to InvestingPro Fair Value, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) show only limited upside.\nWhen it comes to average analyst price targets, none of the Magnificent 7 stocks show negative potential, but none appear to offer substantial upside either. Alphabet has the highest potential, with an average target suggesting a 12% increase from current levels.\nAlthough the ongoing AI boom and other tailwinds could continue to support Nvidia and its peers, these tech giants may no longer be the most explosive opportunities for the next phase of the bull market in tech stocks.\nIt\u2019s Time to Think Outside the Box to Find the Best Technology Stocks\nToday, the most attractive opportunities may lie in lesser-known names, such as those identified by the Tech Titans strategy, available to InvestingPro subscribers.\nThis strategy uses AI to identify the most promising U.S. tech stocks each month\u2014on the 1st\u2014and provides clear and detailed justifications for every stock entry or exit.\nThe results are, to say the least, impressive, with long-term performance exceeding +2,370%.\nSource: InvestingPro\nOver the years, the strategy has delivered standout returns by getting ahead of the crowd on some of the most popular names of 2023\u20132024:\n-\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI): +185.8%\n-\nMicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR): +94.9%\n-\nNvidia: +226.4%\nAnd several major wins have already emerged this year, including:\nRecent results speak for themselves: 95% of the stocks identified by the strategy at the beginning of June finished the month higher. July is also off to a strong start, with nearly as many winning positions already.\nIn addition to its performance, ProPicks AI stands out because every decision is justified. For example, a position in Axcelis was closed on July 1 with a +46.6% gain\u2014and came with a full rationale.\nSource: InvestingPro\nFinally, the Tech Titans strategy is just one of over 30 AI-managed strategies available, covering both thematic and regional focuses. This makes it easier for investors with different goals and risk appetites to find a strategy that fits their needs.\n****\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

  "argos_summary": "U.S. President Donald Trump blasted ABC and NBC as \u2018fake news\u2019 and urged the FCC to revoke their broadcast licenses over alleged bias, claiming the networks gave him 97% negative stories and should pay more for airwaves. He cited recent $16\u202fmillion and $15\u202fmillion settlements with CBS and ABC over defamation claims. The move escalates his long\u2011standing feud with mainstream media, though he has no legal authority to force license revocations. The article also briefly discusses Nvidia\u2019s market performance and AI\u2011driven stock strategies, but these are unrelated to Trump\u2019s media criticism.",
