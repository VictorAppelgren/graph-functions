      "feedback": "The draft is focused and largely compliant, but it needs tighter evidence, clearer handle‑mapping, and a more explicit action/validation framework.  Here are concrete edits:\n\n1. **Add explicit magnitude ranges and dates**  \n   - State the DXY range: “DXY is 97.9 today, expected to fall to ~95.8 by Aug 30 (≈ 2 % decline) (7XH2DKEKV).”  \n   - Cite the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread: “The 2‑yr/10‑yr spread is 57 bp, a steepening that supports dollar weakness (7XH2DKEKV).”  \n   - Include the exact catalyst windows: “PCE inflation data will be released Aug 30; non‑farm payrolls on Aug 31; Fed minutes on Aug 29.”  \n\n2. **Map every claim to canonical handles**  \n   - Dollar → `dxy`, `usd`, `usdcnh` (if relevant).  \n   - Yield curve → `ust2y`, `ust10y`.  \n   - Euro & yen → `eurusd`, `usdjpy`.  \n   - Add citations for each handle: e.g., “DXY 97.9 (dxy) (7XH2DKEKV).”\n\n3. **Explicitly state the recommendation**  \n   - “Short DXY/USDCNH; long UST10Y; hold UST2Y.”  \n   - Provide the expected impact in basis points: “Short DXY should generate ~200 bp of upside if the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread remains above 50 bp.”\n\n4. **Detail the risk/invalidations**  \n   - “If PCE > 3 % or payrolls exceed expectations, the dovish bias may collapse, pushing DXY up by 50–100 bp.”  \n   - “If Fed minutes signal a pause or hike, the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread could flatten to < 30 bp, halting the dollar decline.”  \n\n5. **Add citations for each new claim**  \n   - Use the article ID for each fact: e.g., “PCE data due Aug 30 (7XH2DKEKV).”\n\n6. **Remove any redundant or vague statements**  \n   - The sentence “Market reaction to the Trump‑Cook drama has been muted” can be shortened to “Trump‑Cook litigation has not yet materially moved the dollar; the market remains focused on policy signals (7XH2DKEKV).”\n\n7. **Ensure every claim has a supporting source**  \n   - If you add a new risk scenario, cite a credible source (e.g., Fed minutes release schedule or Fed’s policy statement).\n\nImplementing these changes will make the analysis fully compliant with the Argos standards: concise, evidence‑based, and actionable for a top‑macro PM.",
