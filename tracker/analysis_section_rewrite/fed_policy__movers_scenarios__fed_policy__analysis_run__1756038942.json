      "feedback": "Up | 3–6 months | Regime A easing with dollar softness and higher risk appetite fueling AI/capex cycles | Watch for a September rate cut (~25–50bp) and total easing of ~150–175bp that lift capex visibility and semis momentum | 65% (GX057ADL7)\n\nUp | 3–6 months | Intel governance signal from a passive stake (board-aligned) as a governance signal rather than a transactional trigger | Watch vesting progress of Intel stake and Canada carve-out timing that could lift cross-border capex visibility | 60% (XQWTVR71K)(H7Q52FKDH)\n\nDown | 3–6 months | Inflation persistence and policy misreads that keep financial conditions tight | Watch for stronger-than-expected inflation data and potential re-escalation of tariffs/export controls that could derail easing | 25% (GX057ADL7)(37UZC9X8I)(H7Q52FKDH)\n\nDown | 3–6 months | Geopolitical/supply-chain shocks or policy misreads increasing risk premia and snapping risk-on liquidity | Watch for renewed sanctions or export-control escalations affecting chips and cross-border tech flows | 20% (GX057ADL7)(H7Q52FKDH)\n\nActionable edit instructions: tighten the causal chain by tying each driver to explicit market transmission metrics (FX, yields, risk premia) and thresholds; replace ad-hoc probability nudges with a transparent, probability-calibrated framework anchored to defined triggers (e.g., Sep cut timing/magnitude and Canada carve-out timeline); harmonize sources (GX057ADL7, 37UZC9X8I, XQWTVR71K, TN66GHPAT, H7Q52FKDH) into a single coherent narrative with a clear invalidation rule; improve specificity of triggers (CPI/payrolls for inflation, policy guidance for Jackson Hole, export-control developments) and align watch-list signals with exact dates and thresholds; and fix data-quality notes (e.g., inconsistent OQ figures) ensuring all numerical claims have primary-source backing.",
