  "title": "Controversial $250 Visa Integrity Fee Will Cost US $11 Billion As It Deters Tourists, Analysts Say",
  "description": "The U.S. is facing a steep decline in international travelers\u2014and this fee will only make it worse, say tourism officials.",
  "content": "How Will The $250 Fee Impact Tourism To The U.s.?\n\nThe CBO based its estimate solely on the potential revenue generated by the fee itself, while the U.S. tourism industry looked at the macroeconomic impact of implementing the fee, hence the wildly different estimates. The CBO estimated that charging roughly 11 million annual visa applicants $250 apiece would rake in roughly $2.7 billion per year for the State Department. Tourism officials say Congress wrongly assumed the pricey fee would have little impact on the volume of visitation. Tourism Economics, a division of Oxford Economics, estimated that the $250-per-person fee is onerous enough to deter 5.4% of international visitors from coming to the U.S., which would translate to a drop of nearly 1 million fewer visits annually. Fewer visitors translate to less visitor spending, and in turn to lower tax revenue and job losses in the tourism industry, sending a negative ripple effect throughout the national economy. \u201cBy longstanding tradition, the Congressional Budget Office does not incorporate macroeconomic feedback effects into its traditional cost estimates,\u201d a CBO spokesperson told Forbes. \u201cWe didn't specifically do a dynamic analysis of this provision.\u201d In other words, the CBO did not factor in the potential negative economic impact from lower visitor spending, tax revenue and subsequent job cuts\u2014key metrics used by the U.S. tourism industry and the U.S. Commerce Department to evaluate the overall value of tourism to the U.S. economy. \u201cI think in the minds of congressional leaders, foreign visitors don't vote, so making them pay more to help fund the [Big Beautiful] Bill wouldn\u2019t come at any political cost,\u201d Erik Hansen, senior vice president of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association, told Forbes. \u201cBut the problem is it comes at a huge economic cost to American businesses.\u201d\n\nWhat Else Do U.s. Tourism Experts Say Congress Got Wrong?\n\n\u201cCongress made the mistake of assuming that this worldwide visa integrity fee would not have a big impact on visitors from countries like India or Brazil,\u201d Hansen told Forbes. \u201cThis is the exact type of armchair public policymaking that is going to get us into a big mess.\u201d India, in particular, is a \u201cbright spot\u201d for inbound international travel because visitation numbers have surpassed where they were in 2019, he said, while most other countries are lagging behind their pre-pandemic volume. In 2024, Indian tourists spent roughly $13.3 billion in the U.S., according to the National Travel and Tourism Office, part of the U.S. Commerce Department. \u201cApplying a $250 fee to a country where travel is growing is mindboggling. It will absolutely deter travel\u2014that\u2019s what our research has found,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nWhat Do International Visitors Need To Know About The Visa Integrity Fee?\n\nThe fee is not actually as \u201crefundable\u201d as Congress has billed it to be. As written, the Big Beautiful Bill says the State Department \u201cmay reimburse\u201d the fee after the visitor\u2019s visa expires, provided that the visa holder has complied with all conditions of the visa. But most visitor visas are valid for 10 years, Hansen pointed out. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to give the government money and then wait around 10 years and remember to ask for it back, even if you followed the rules, is just absolutely crazy,\u201d he said. Indeed, to arrive at its projection, the CBO reasoned in its estimate that \u201ca large number of nonimmigrants would not be eligible to seek reimbursement until several years after paying the fee\u201d so consequently only \u201ca small number of people would seek reimbursement.\u201d In other words, said Hansen, \u201cthere\u2019s a very good understanding that the refund process itself is not going to be easy, and even if it is easy, that a lot of people aren't going to seek that refund after a decade.\u201d Another red flag: The $250 fee was inserted into the Big Beautiful Bill without a plan for processing refunds. In its analysis, the CBO wrote that \u201cthe Department of State would need several years to implement a process for providing reimbursements.\u201d\n\nWhy Are So Many International Travelers Avoiding The U.s. This Year?\n\nIn June, a World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) analysis of the economic impact of tourism in 184 countries revealed the U.S. was the only country forecast to see international visitor spending decline in 2025, which by some estimates is as much as $29 billion. The root causes of this decline, multiple studies have found, are a combination of President Trump\u2019s tariffs, travel bans, inflammatory rhetoric and harsher immigration policies, all which have created a chilling effect on visitors. \u201cWhile other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the \u2018closed\u2019 sign,\u201d Julia Simpson, president and CEO of WTTC, said in a statement. \u201cGiven we\u2019re halfway through the year and we\u2019ve seen these impacts, we don't know when the stiffest headwind is, but I think it does stay sustained,\u201d Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics, told Forbes last month. \u201cWe\u2019re generally assuming that this persists for a while and that some of it is going to persist throughout the end of the administration.\u201d Simpson characterized the WTTC study as a \u201cwake-up call for the U.S. government,\u201d adding that \u201cwithout urgent action to restore international traveler confidence, it could take several years for the U.S. just to return to pre-pandemic levels of international visitor spend.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s signature spending bill contains another blow to U.S. tourism. A Senate committee led by Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) slashed the budget of Brand USA, the country\u2019s public-private destination marketing organization, from $100 million to $20 million. \u201cThis is another error that Congress has made,\u201d Hansen said, noting that the Trump administration recommended full funding for the organization in its fiscal year 2026 budget. \u201cWe have a big misperception problem among international visitors right now, but Congress cut funding for the one organization that's in charge of setting perceptions and sending a welcoming message about travel to the United States.\u201d",

      "text": "Topline\nAs the Trump administration considers significantly expanding the travel ban to more than four dozen countries, World Cup host cities in the United States that were banking on filling half their stadiums and hotels with foreign visitors could lose big.\nKey Facts\nThe Trump administration is mulling adding 36 nations to the 12 countries already on the travel ban list, according to a memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, The Washington Post reported over the weekend.\nThe ban prevents non-U.S. residents, primarily from the Middle East and Africa, from visiting the U.S. due to what the administration calls national security concerns and public safety.\nNew countries potentially facing a full or a partial ban if they do not address the administration\u2019s concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe\u2014joining the original 12 banned countries of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\nThe World Cup qualification process is still ongoing for some confederations, including UEFA (Europe) and CAF (Africa).\nThe travel ban has a key carve out for international athletes traveling to the U.S. for sports events like the World Cup in 2026 and Olympics in 2028\u2014but not for soccer supporters from banned countries.\nThe F\u00e9deration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) projects that World Cup 2026 will drive $30.5 billion in economic output in the U.S., predicated on the assumption the U.S. will see an \u201cinflux of visitors.\u201d\nFIFA has told World Cup host cities to expect a 50/50 split between domestic and international visitors.\nWhy Is The U.s. Expanding Trump\u2019s Travel Ban?\nA memo from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent Saturday to U.S. diplomats said 36 nations were being given 60 days to meet new benchmarks and requirements established by the State Department, according to the Post\u2019s report. The countries were given a deadline of 8 a.m. Wednesday to provide an initial action plan. Among the unattained benchmarks reportedly identified in the memo included countries that had \u201cno competent or cooperative central government authority to produce reliable identity documents or other civil documents\u201d or \u201cwidespread government fraud.\u201d Some countries landed on the list because they had large numbers of citizens who overstayed their visas in the U.S., according to the memo. \u201cThe Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process,\u201d an agency spokesperson told Forbes, adding that the State Department \u201cdoes not comment on internal deliberations or communications, but we are constantly reevaluating policies to ensure the safety of Americans and that foreign nationals follow our laws.\u201d\nHow Could The Travel Ban Hurt The World Cup 2026?\nFIFA\u2019s projections that World Cup 2026 will drive $30.5 billion in economic output in the U.S., according to an analysis from FIFA and OpenEconomics (OE), is predicated on the assumption the U.S. will see an \u201cinflux of visitors\u201d from foreign countries to fill stadiums and hotels. Philadelphia projects the six matches it hosts next summer will draw 500,000 visitors who will fill more than 100,000 hotel rooms and drive $305 million in direct tourism spending and $770 million in total economic impact, Meg Kane, chief executive of Philadelphia\u2019s World Cup organizing committee, told Forbes. Kansas City is also hosting six matches\u2014four group stage matches, a round of 32, and then a quarter final, \u201cwhich is really important from both a tourism standpoint and a global visibility standpoint,\u201d Pam Kramer, chief executive officer of KC2026, the nonprofit organization leading the city\u2019s World Cup planning, told Forbes. Kramer said Kansas City is expecting to draw 650,000 visitors over the course of the tournament and an estimated $653 million in direct event impact. The other nine U.S.-based World Cup host cities are: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.\nHow Important Are International Visitors To The Success Of The World Cup?\nBased on FIFA guidance, host cities like Philadelphia and Kansas City are expecting a 50/50 split between domestic and international travelers. Before speaking with Forbes, neither Kane nor Kramer was aware the government was mulling an expansion of the travel ban, but both stressed the importance of staying nimble in an uncertain environment. Kane said her organization\u2019s job is to provide a terrific World Cup experience \u201cto however many fans come\u201d to Philadelphia. \u201cWe really focus on that, because the fact is that there is always a level of international uncertainty that comes with hosting any major international sporting event. There are geopolitical issues that we cannot see around the corner that may impact the tournament in 2026.\u201d Kramer said her team in Kansas City is used to \u201coperating with a high degree of uncertainty in general,\u201d adding that the tournament is still a year away. \u201cA year is, well, it feels very short. But it's also quite a bit of time when you think about it from a global perspective.\u201d\nWhat Other Headwinds Are The U.s. Tourism Industry Facing?\nThe U.S. Travel Association (USTA) was thrilled when President Trump created a White House task force for FIFA World Cup 2026 in March, saying the tournament could draw millions of visitors \u201cif we build the right processes.\u201d But some tourism experts say the Trump administration has damaged the U.S. brand with unwelcoming messaging and policies, particularly President Trump\u2019s tariffs, imperialistic rhetoric and viral headlines of foreigners with legal tourist visas and green cards being detained by U.S. immigration officials. Those factors are \u201cstacking up as significant hurdles for the U.S. travel industry\u201d and \u201csetting international travel back several years,\u201d Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics, a nonpartisan Oxford Economics company tracking tourism statistics, told Forbes in March. Since Trump took office, the U.S. has seen a dramatic downturn in inbound international tourism, with a projected 8.7% drop in U.S. international arrivals for 2025, according to the latest forecast from Tourism Economics. Visits from Canada (-20.2%) and Western Europe (-5.8%) show the sharpest declines.\nBig Number\n$3.6 billion. That\u2019s the estimated economic boost to World Cup host cities\u2019 economies generated by guests staying at Airbnb properties during the tournament next summer, according to company projections.\nSmall Number\n0.5%. That\u2019s the portion of annual inbound visitors to the U.S. coming from countries currently affected by the recent policy announcement, according to the USTA. \u201cWe are focused on driving millions of new visitors and strengthening our economy by solving longtime shortcomings with visas, customs, and an outdated air traffic control system. America\u2019s 250th birthday, the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games present America with a unique opportunity to cement itself as the global travel destination of choice,\u201d a USTA spokesperson told Forbes via email.\nWill Soccer Stars From Banned Countries Be Allowed To Play In Fifa World Cup 2026?\nAthletes playing on teams representing countries on the banned list will get a carve out. According to President Trump\u2019s June 4 executive order, the travel ban includes an exception for \u201cany athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.\u201d The directive notes that exceptions are at the discretion of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has yet to provide a full list of sports events that qualify.\nFurther Reading\nSome Sports Events Will Escape Trump Travel Ban\u2014But Only Marco Rubio Gets To Decide (Forbes)"

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s marquee legislation includes steep increases to non-immigrant visa fees that kick in next year\u2013just as the U.S. hopes to attract World Cup 2026 soccer supporters.\nKey Facts\nThe bill introduces a new $250 \u201cvisa integrity fee\u201d for most non-immigrant U.S. visas, including tourist, student and work visas, beginning in 2026.\nThe new fee, added to the bill by Republican lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee, is one of 22 immigration fees in the bill designed \u201cto encourage lawful conduct among foreign nationals visiting the United States,\u201d but critics, including U.S. tourism officials, say it will result in fewer international visitors to the United States.\n\u201cRaising fees on lawful international visitors amounts to a self-imposed tariff on one of our nation\u2019s largest exports: international travel spending,\u201d Geoff Freeman, president of the U.S. Travel Association (USTA) said in a statement.\nThe House Judiciary Committee press office did not immediately reply to Forbes\u2019 request for comment on the USTA\u2019s claims.\nThe Trump administration is also considering significantly expanding the 12-country travel ban to more than four dozen countries, World Cup host cities in the United States that were banking on filling half their stadiums and hotels with foreign visitors could lose big.\nWhy Do U.s. Tourism Officials Say The Visa Integrity Fee Is A Bad Idea?\nU.S. tourism officials argue that anything that makes it more difficult or expensive to visit the United States can be a deterrent to large numbers of visitors. International visitors spent $254 billion on U.S. travel and tourism-related goods and services in 2024, according to the International Trade Administration. But a recent study from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) that analyzed the economic impact of tourism in 184 countries revealed the U.S. was the only country forecast to see international visitor spending decline in 2025. \u201cWhile other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the \u2018closed\u2019 sign,\u201d Julia Simpson, president and CEO of WTTC, said in a statement. As a result, the U.S. tourism industry is on track to miss out on $29 billion in tourism revenue this year. The new visa integrity fee will add $250 to a tourist\u2019s travel bill. \u201cThese fees are not reinvested in improving the travel experience and do nothing but discourage visitation at a time when foreign travelers are already concerned about the welcome experience and high prices,\u201d Freeman, the USTA president said, in his statement.\nWill The United States\u2019 New Visa Integrity Fee Be Refundable?\nIt appears that some travelers will be able to get reimbursed. The bill states that U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem \u201cmay provide a reimbursement to an alien of the fee required ... if such alien demonstrates that he or she ... complied with all conditions of such nonimmigrant visa.\u201d The conditions listed include not accepting employment while in the U.S.; not extending the length the stay; or being granted an extension of stay. But the text of the bill does not spell out how onerous the reimbursement process will be for a tourist wishing to reclaim the $250 fee.\nWhat Else In The Big Beautiful Bill Could Negatively Impact Us Tourism In 2026?\nThe bill includes $4.1 billion to hire and train at least 5,000 new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and $2 billion in CBP retention bonuses to address staffing shortages at the agency. In his statement, Freeman characterized this as a win, saying additional CBP staff will \u201chelp lower wait times at airports and improve the traveler experience.\u201d But it\u2019s also possible that more CBP officers may have the exact opposite effect. \u201cI think increasingly, whether there's validity to it or not, we have to acknowledge these headlines around the world of people being detained, of their devices being searched, stories of deportation\u2014it\u2019s causing a degree of fear,\u201d Freeman told Forbes in April when discussing the significant drop in Canadian visitation, adding, \u201cAnd in the absence of effective communication to explain what CBP is doing, what US policy is the fact that we want you to come we've allowed this negative publicity to run rampant.\u201d\nHow Much Tourism Revenue Is At Stake For World Cup 2026?\nIn March, FIFA projected the World Cup 2026 will drive $30.5 billion in economic output in the U.S., according to an analysis by OpenEconomics (OE). But that number was predicated on the assumption the U.S. will see an \u201cinflux of visitors\u201d from foreign countries to fill stadiums and hotels. FIFA has told World Cup host cities to expect a 50/50 split between domestic and international visitors, multiple host city tourism officials told Forbes. Philadelphia expects the six matches it hosts next summer to draw 500,000 visitors and fill more than 100,000 hotel rooms to the tune of $305 million in direct tourism spending and $770 million in total economic impact, Meg Kane, chief executive of Philadelphia\u2019s World Cup organizing committee, told Forbes in June. Kansas City\u2014which is hosting four group stage matches, a round of 32, and then a quarter final\u2014is expecting to draw 650,000 visitors over the course of the tournament and an estimated $653 million in direct event impact, Pam Kramer, chief executive officer of KC2026, the nonprofit organization leading the city\u2019s World Cup planning, told Forbes.\nWhy Is Trump\u2019s Relationship With Fifa Controversial?\nOn Monday, FIFA announced it is a tenant in Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower, seen by Trump critics as an example of the sitting U.S. president co-mingling his role as head of state with his business interests. \u201cOn behalf of myself, on behalf of New York, on behalf of the Trump Organization and everybody that works in this building \u2013 we love you,\u201d Eric Trump said in remarks at a public relations event attended by former Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo. FIFA president Gianni Infantino\u2019s coziness with Trump has drawn criticism from international soccer organizations. In May, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) excoriated Infantino for arriving late to the FIFA Congress in order to meet with Trump during his Middle East tour, accusing the FIFA chief of putting \u201cprivate political interests\u201d ahead of his commitment to soccer. Infantino was a guest at Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, has attended White House meetings and has been a vocal supporter of the president. FIFA did not respond to Forbes\u2019 request for a statement regarding the visa integrity fee.\nTangent\nThe Big Beautiful Bill also slashes the budget of Brand USA, the country\u2019s public-private destination marketing organization, from $100 million to $20 million. USTA said it is \u201cdeeply concerned,\u201d noting that \u201cfor every $1 spent on marketing, Brand USA adds $25 to the U.S. economy,\u201d and warning such drastic cuts will \u201csignificantly impact every sector of our industry.\u201d\nFurther Reading\nHow A 48-Country Travel Ban Could Suppress U.S. Tourism In A World Cup Year (Forbes)"

      "text": "Topline\nWhile tourism is booming across the rest of the world, the U.S. is a notable loser this year as tens of millions of international visitors are choosing to travel elsewhere\u2014costing the economy up to $29 billion\u2014and risking millions of jobs.\nKey Facts\nLast month, a study from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) that analyzed the economic impact of tourism in 184 countries revealed the U.S. was the only country forecast to see international visitor spending decline in 2025.\nThe WTTC projects the U.S. to be on track to lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending this year compared to last year, according to the research.\nIt could be argued, however, that the actual losses will be significantly larger, given that Tourism Economics, a division of Oxford Economics, had originally forecasted the U.S. would see a 9% jump in international inbound travel in 2025.\nA 9% increase would have equated to a boost of about $16.3 billion in revenue for the U.S. economy.\nInstead, Tourism Economics has revised its baseline forecast to a year-over-year decline of 8.2%\u2014a significant 17.2% variance from its original 9% increase.\nFrom the anticipated $16.3 billion increase in revenue to a loss of between $8.3 billion (Tourism Economics estimate) and $12.5 billion (WTTC estimate), the U.S. is facing a shortfall of $25 billion to $29 billion this year.\nWhy Are International Travelers Avoiding The U.s. This Year?\n\u201cWhile other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the \u2018closed\u2019 sign,\u201d Julia Simpson, president and CEO of WTTC, said in a statement. In its latest client note, Tourism Economics blamed \u201csentiment headwinds\u201d for its projections of significant declines in visitation from Canada (-20.2%) and Western Europe (-4.9%) in 2025. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, travel bans, inflammatory rhetoric and harsh immigration policies have combined for a chilling effect on visitors\u2014and there\u2019s little indication of a reversal anytime soon. \u201cGiven we\u2019re halfway through the year and we\u2019ve seen these impacts, we don't know when the stiffest headwind is, but I think it does stay sustained,\u201d Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics, told Forbes. \u201cWe\u2019re generally assuming that this persists for a while and that some of it is going to persist throughout the end of the administration.\u201d\nWhich Tourists Are The Most Missed By U.s. Destinations?\nThe significant decline in visitors from Canada is particularly costly, as Canadian tourists made up roughly one-quarter of all foreign travelers who came to the United States in 2024, according to the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO). Last year, Canadians spent $20.5 billion\u2014nearly twice what Americans spent at McDonald\u2019s restaurants in all of last year. And the Canadians show no signs of relenting. In May, Canadian visitation dropped 38% by car and 24% by air compared to the same month in 2024. It was the fifth consecutive month of steepening year-over-year declines, following double-digit drops in April and March. On first-quarter earnings calls in early May, executives from major hotel and travel companies noted that Canadians were still traveling as much as ever\u2014just not to the United States. Hyatt chief executive officer Mark Hoplamazian called the phenomenon \u201ca flyover.\u201d\nHave Trump\u2019s Policies Impacted Americans Traveling Abroad?\nIn recent months, news outlets from CNN to USA Today to the BBC have reported an increase in anxiety among Americans fearing backlash or hostility when traveling abroad. In a snap survey conducted by Global Rescue in March after Trump\u2019s address to Congress, 72% of 11,000 respondents\u2014the majority based in the U.S. and Canada\u2014believed Americans would be \u201cperceived more negatively abroad in 2025 due to recent U.S. international policy proposals.\u201d (The U.S. State Department\u2019s \u201cworldwide caution,\u201d issued one day after the U.S. bombed Iran, which advises Americans to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d while out of the country, is a separate issue.) Other outlets have reported that some Americans are more concerned about being detained or harassed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents when they re-enter the U.S., perhaps in retaliation for anti-Trump criticism on social media. During both Trump administrations, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has repeatedly warned Americans that agents have searched the electronic devices of U.S. citizens at the border, sometimes holding phones or laptops for weeks or even months. \u201cAll travelers crossing the United States border are subject to CBP inspection,\u201d the Customs and Border Protection website confirms. \u201cOn rare occasions, CBP officers may search a traveler\u2019s mobile phone, computer, camera, or other electronic devices during the inspection process,\u201d adding that \u201cless than 0.01 percent of arriving international travelers\u201d have their electronic devices searched. But reports of the agency targeting individuals for anti-Trump sentiment persist. Last month, Turkish-American influencer Hasan Piker was reportedly detained for hours at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after returning from France. Piker claims federal agents asked him, \u201cDo you like Donald Trump?\u201d Last week, an American political consultant returning from a family vacation in Turks and Caicos was detained for 45 minutes in a holding room at the airport, the Los Angeles Times reported. The consultant said agents didn\u2019t give him a reason for the delay but he \u201cspeculated that perhaps it was because of the Obama-Biden T-shirt packed in his suitcase.\u201d\nCan The Downward Trend Be Turned Around?\n\u201cThis is a wake-up call for the U.S. government,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cWithout urgent action to restore international traveler confidence, it could take several years for the U.S. just to return to pre-pandemic levels of international visitor spend.\u201d Yet the Trump administration and Republican party do not appear to be taking note. A Senate committee led by Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) slashed the budget of Brand USA, the country\u2019s public-private destination marketing organization, from $100 million to $20 million. The U.S. Travel Association said it is \u201cdeeply concerned,\u201d claiming that \u201cfor every $1 spent on marketing, Brand USA adds $25 to the U.S. economy,\u201d and warning such drastic cuts will \u201csignificantly impact every sector of our industry.\u201d\nFurther Reading\nHow Trump Is Torpedoing Foreign Tourism To The US\u2014Potentially For Years To Come, Say Analysts (Forbes)"

  "argos_summary": "The new $250 visa integrity fee, slated to begin in 2026, is expected to deter about 5.4% of international visitors, potentially cutting roughly 1\u202fmillion trips and $29\u202fbillion in tourism revenue, according to tourism economists, while the CBO projects only $2.7\u202fbillion in fee revenue because it ignores macroeconomic feedback.  The fee comes amid a broader Trump\u2011era push that includes a possible expansion of the travel ban to 36 more countries, a $80\u202fmillion cut to Brand\u202fUSA\u2019s marketing budget, and heightened scrutiny of U.S. border enforcement\u2014all of which are eroding the country\u2019s appeal to foreign travelers.  These policies threaten to undermine the projected $30.5\u202fbillion economic boost from the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as host cities rely on a 50/50 split of domestic and international fans to fill stadiums and hotels.  Overall, the combination of higher fees, stricter bans, and reduced marketing is likely to keep U.S. tourism on a downward trajectory for years to come.",
