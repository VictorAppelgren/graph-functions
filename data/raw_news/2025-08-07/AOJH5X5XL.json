  "title": "This Is the Easiest EV to Own\u2014and You Can Find One for Just $25K",
  "description": "Once a $50K tech-packed EV, this model is now shockingly affordable thanks to steep depreciation.",
  "content": "Shopping for a new car is the default for most people, but there\u2019s something satisfying about scoring a great used vehicle\u2014especially if it\u2019s electric. With EVs evolving so quickly, yesterday\u2019s high-tech flagship can easily become today\u2019s used-car bargain.\n\nUnlike gas-powered models, EVs tend to depreciate faster, mostly because demand in the used market hasn\u2019t quite caught up. That\u2019s great news for buyers, because a used EV can offer futuristic tech and design for the same price as a basic new compact car.\n\nMany of these EVs sold for nearly $50,000 just a few years ago, but now you can snag one for under $30K. So which one gives you the most for your money?\n\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 5 Has Everything\u2014and It\u2019s Now Under $25K Used\n\nWe know we\u2019ve sung this car\u2019s praises before, but the hype is absolutely justified. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 keeps showing up on our lists for a reason.\n\nHyundai nailed the formula with this one\u2014great design, smooth ride, and loads of tech. And the best part? According to Kelley Blue Book, you can now find a 2023 Ioniq 5 for around $20,920.\n\nDig a little deeper into the listings, and you\u2019ll spot some 2022 models going for even less. That\u2019s a serious deal for a car that still feels brand-new.\n\nRoomy, Relaxed, and Ready for Anything\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping for a used EV under $25K that can do it all, it better have room for it all, too. Good news\u2014the Ioniq 5 more than delivers.\n\nWith 106.5 cubic feet of passenger space, it actually edges out the Tesla Model Y. Half a cubic foot might not sound like much, but that\u2019s basically the size of a microwave\u2014and when it comes to comfort, every inch counts.\n\nSo, whether it\u2019s passengers, gear, or just room to stretch out, the Ioniq 5 packs more space than you\u2019d expect at this price point.\n\nWhen it comes to cargo space, the Ioniq 5 doesn\u2019t quite match up to the Model Y. It offers 59.3 cubic feet behind the rear seats, while the Model Y boasts a roomy 72.1 cubic feet.\n\nThe front trunk tells a similar story\u2014the Ioniq 5 gives you about 2 cubic feet up front, but that drops to just 0.85 cubic feet if you go for the dual-motor AWD version. Meanwhile, the Model Y\u2019s front trunk doubles that at 4.1 cubic feet.\n\nPracticality isn\u2019t just about space\u2014it\u2019s about how you use it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re big fans of the Ioniq 5\u2019s interior design, which feels fresh and smart in all the right ways.\n\nFor example, the center console slides back and forth, giving front passengers more legroom or letting rear passengers grab some extra storage. Instead of a typical glove box, there\u2019s a handy drawer, and a magnetized fabric panel on the dash lets you personalize your space\u2014kind of like decorating a fridge.\n\nOne standout feature that\u2019s just catching on in 2025 but was ahead of its time here is the vehicle-to-load (V2L) tech. It lets you power your gadgets, appliances, or even your home during outages using the car\u2019s battery\u2014and yes, you can even trickle-charge another EV. It might sound like a gimmick, but when the power goes out, you\u2019ll be the neighbor everyone envies.\n\nLooks matter just as much as practicality, and the Ioniq 5 doesn\u2019t disappoint. Even as a used EV under $30,000, it\u2019s snagged plenty of design awards and still turns heads better than many brand-new gas cars in the same price range.\n\nHonestly, you\u2019ll feel proud pulling up in an Ioniq 5\u2014it\u2019s proof that style doesn\u2019t have to come with a hefty price tag.\n\nIs it a crossover or a hatchback? Honestly, it\u2019s hard to tell just by looking. The Ioniq 5\u2019s design tricks the eye\u2014its proportions feel compact, like a Lancia Delta HF Integrale, but in person, it\u2019s surprisingly roomy.\n\nThat retrofuturistic style really hits the mark, especially with the eye-catching Parametric Pixel LED lights. The lower trims sport black cladding and 19-inch wheels, while the top models step it up with 20-inch wheels and silver accents.\n\nOf course, flush door handles are a must-have for any modern EV, and the Ioniq 5 nails this detail. They pop out when you unlock the car and tuck back in when you lock it, while higher trims add a power tailgate for extra convenience.\n\nThe Ioniq 5\u2019s interior feels more like a stylish lounge than a typical car cabin. Most trims come with a sleek black interior, but if you want to step it up, the optional white interior really brightens the mood.\n\nNo matter which version you choose, you\u2019ll get two sharp 10.25-inch screens, soft-touch materials, and a mix of leather and eco-friendly textiles. Plus, there\u2019s plenty of room for five people, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and handy wireless charging to keep your devices juiced up.\n\nGo for the higher trims, and you\u2019re treated to ambient LED lighting with 64 colors and a panoramic glass roof that opens up the cabin. You\u2019ll also get leather or leatherette seats, a premium Bose sound system, and those awesome Relaxation Seats\u2014complete with footrests for the front passengers.\n\nYes, even the driver gets to kick back, which is a nice touch while waiting for a charge. Plus, there\u2019s a household outlet inside the car, thanks to its handy vehicle-to-load (V2L) feature.\n\nGet More for Less With a Used Ioniq 5\n\nScoring an Ioniq 5 for under $30,000 is a sweet deal. Since it\u2019s already gone through most of its depreciation, you\u2019re jumping in when the value drop slows down\u2014and that means you get to enjoy all the savings that come with driving electric.\n\nMore Affordable to Drive Than Its Rivals\n\nLet\u2019s start with insurance\u2014EVs often get tagged as pricier to insure because repairs can be more complex. According to CarEdge, the average yearly insurance for the Ioniq 5 is about $2,354, which is roughly $723 more than the typical SUV.\n\nThat said, your actual insurance bill can swing quite a bit based on where you live and your driving history. So keep that in mind when budgeting.\n\nCharging costs really come down to how often you use public chargers versus a home setup. Charging at home is hands down the cheapest way to go\u2014way cheaper than filling up at the pump\u2014so having a garage or home charger is a huge advantage.\n\nIf you\u2019re in an apartment or condo without easy charging access, public chargers can sometimes cost more than gas. On the bright side, EVs have fewer moving parts, which means maintenance costs tend to be lower, too.\n\nWorried about how long the Ioniq 5\u2019s battery will last? Well, one guy in South Korea put that fear to rest by racking up over 400,000 miles\u2014413,992 to be exact\u2014in less than three years. He was a traveling salesman averaging nearly 380 miles a day, which is way more than most of us will ever drive.\n\nHyundai actually swapped out his battery at 360,000 miles\u2014well past the U.S. warranty limit of 10 years or 100,000 miles\u2014not because it failed, but because they wanted to study how it held up under such intense use. They found that the battery was still holding 87 percent of its original capacity, despite frequent fast charging all the way to 100 percent.\n\nSo, if that\u2019s what extreme use looks like, everyday drivers have nothing to stress about. As long as you care for it properly, the Ioniq 5\u2019s battery is built to go the distance.",

      "text": "Technology\u2019s role in the automotive world is growing at an exponential rate. It seems like every day that we read announcements of new technological features that will change the way we view cars. However, among the many innovations, there is one piece of tech that stands out, laying the foundation for every other example of innovation.\nThere are tons of features in new cars that make them more comfortable and less taxing to drive. From self-driving features to advanced infotainment systems. However, at the forefront of all of these technologies is artificial intelligence.\nWe take a dive into how artificial intelligence is shaping the automotive world. We look at some of the core functions that AI serves in a vehicles and how it can improve our lives. Outlining some of the key players in the current market, we find out who is leading the march in the AI revolution.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed.\nArtificial Intelligence is The Next Automotive Revolution\nInnovation in the automotive world has always been focused around making the user experience better. The problem is that this has historically meant a lot of independent features that you have to set and control based on your preferences. However, automakers may have a solution to that.\nAdjusting To Your Preferences\nArtificial intelligence represents a solution to a lot of the issues that automakers are currently running into with their cars becoming so technologically advanced. Users have more choice than ever when customizing the experience in their vehicles, but doing so often takes a lot of time and takes focus away from driving.\nArtificial intelligence in vehicles aims to lessen the load on the driver by adjusting to their individual preferences. It aims to make each vehicle more personalized, with settings automatically adjusting to where you want them. It can adjust navigation routes based on paths you like to take, it can adjust suspension settings by reacting to the road surface and how you drive, and it can even react to your commands and give detailed feedback.\nAutomakers Leading The Charge in Artificial Intelligence\n- Tesla\n- Mercedes-Benz\n- BMW\n- Lucid\n- Porsche\nArtificial intelligence in cars is no longer something of the future. There are plenty of cars on the road today that make use of this revolutionary technology. Above are just a few of the automakers leading the way. From self-driving features to creating a more comfortable cabin, AI is here.\nTesla was certainly one of the first automakers to utilize artificial intelligence, with vehicles like the Model S representing their best efforts. Since, luxury brands have taken after Tesla and included self-driving features in their cars. Companies like Porsche have even gone beyond Teslas scope, with things like AI-controlled stability control.\nAI-Driven Self-Driving Changes Transport As We Know it\nOne of the most tangible progressions when it comes to artificial intelligence in vehicles is seen in self-driving functions. The ability for cars to navigate streets and traffic to get you to your destination is revolutionary. These systems are made possible through the use of artificial intelligence.\nLevel Two Self-Driving Systems\n- Toyota/Lexus - Teammate\n- Nissan/Infini - ProPilot Assist 2.X\n- Jeep/Ram - Hands-Free Active Driving Assist\n- General Motors - SuperCruise\n- Ford/Lincoln - BlueCruise\n- BMW - Highway Assist\nCurrently, artificial intelligence has made level two self-driving widely achievable by a number of different automakers. It is no longer something reserved for those driving luxury cars. While brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW do offer autonomous driving features, you can also get them in more mainstream products from the likes of Kia, Hyundai, Chevrolet, and Ford.\nCars with level two self-driving essentially process information gathered from a number of different cameras and sensors to control the speed and steering of your vehicle. However, the driver still needs to remain aware and ready to take control at any moment. This takes all the mental strain of driving off of the driver.\nLevel Three Self-Driving Systems\n- Mercedes-Benz - DrivePilot\nAs of now, Mercedes-Benz is the only automaker offering level three autonomy in the United States. DrivePilot is currently limited to specific areas in California and Nevada, but it is still impressive that the company has delivered level three autonomy before any one else.\nLevel three autonomy means that the driver is allowed to completely take their hands off the wheel and perform a secondary task while driving. However, you must remain alert enough to take control of the vehicle when necessary. Many companies are working on adopting level three automation and beyond, though.\nArtificial Intelligence Also Reshapes the Experience in the Cabin\nWhile self-driving is certainly the thing that most people refer to when talking about artificial intelligence in vehicles, there is a lot more to it. This new technology has the ability to completely reshape the experience of the driver and passengers in the car by adjusting to their wants and needs.\nInfotainment Control and Features\n- Voice assistants\n- Natural language processing\n- Predictive navigation\n- Adaptive displays\n- In-car AI chatbots\nAlot of the current artificial intelligence in the cabin of vehicles centers around the infotainment system. Controlling the infotainment system through voice commands has been a thing for a while, but AI enhances the experience by allowing the system to react to your commands in a more dynamic way. Artificial intelligence also allows your system to process gesture controls.\nNavigation is another big area where artificial intelligence has taken control. Your system has the ability to process things like your driving style and preferences, real-time traffic updates, and weather conditions to create the optimal route for you. It can also adjust your route based on other needs, such as planning stops to charge your EV.\nComfort and Performance Features\n- Adaptive climate control\n- Smart seat adjustment\n- Noise cancelation\n- Predictive suspension\n- Cabin air quality control\nAutomakers also utilize artificial intelligence to enhance your comfort and adjust the cabin based on your preferences. Some cars, like the Nissan Ariya, have facial recognition to instantly engage your personalized driver profile. This will adjust things like seating positions, ambient light settings, and gauge cluster profiles.\nThe most impressive AI-driven comfort feature in vehicles, however, is in those that have adaptive suspension. Companies like Porsche have integrated systems that read the road ahead of you and adjust your suspension settings numerous times in a single second to produce the most comfortable ride possible.\nThe Future of Automotive AI is Bright\nThe current state of artificial intelligence is fairly impressive, and it's getting better by the minute. There are a number of projects in the works that aim to improve artificial intelligence in vehicles. Things like full-autonomous vehicles and infotainment systems that can have conversations with you are just around the corner.\nDevelopments in Artificial Intelligence\nOne of the most impressive developments in the world of automotive artificial intelligence is NVIDIA's new Cosmos platform. It provides a new way for AI models to learn. It can generate millions of hours of 3D-rendered simulations and process it quickly to help AI models learn how to react to a plethora of situations without ever having encountered them.\nThere are a ton of other developments and the world of artificial intelligence is constantly shifting and evolving. One thing that is certain is that AI in vehicles is around to stay. While there are concerns about its integration, many automakers claim that giving control over to automated systems will make roads safer and will reduce travel time. There is also little arguing against the fact that AI improves the user's experience in the cabin in ways that we didn't even know we needed."

      "text": "As electric vehicles (EVs) lower in price, more people are considering a switch from gas to battery power. If you get one, you may consider installing a charging station in your home. Let's take a look at what it costs to install one, and whether you actually need one.\nHow Much Does Installing a Home EV Charger Cost?\nThe national average cost in the United States to install a level 2 home charger is $1,200, according to home renovation site Fixr. It could be lower or higher than that for you, as multiple factors affect the cost of installation, including:\n- The type of charging station you install\n- Whether home renovations are necessary\n- Labor costs\n- Permit costs\nAnd more. It's most practical for the majority of people to install a level 2 charger and not a level 3 DC fast charging (DCFC) station in their homes, so we'll look mainly at those costs here.\nCharging Station Type\nEV chargers, also referred to as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) come in three different levels, the first two of which you're more likely to see in the typical home. Home chargers are usually a weather-insulated box mounted to the wall that contains either a charging cable to plug into an EV or an outlet to plug a cable into.\nPretty much all EVs come with a power cord you can plug into your wall at home to get a level 1 charge. This can save you a ton of money if it's enough to top you back up after a daily commute, but it's also the slowest charging option available --- it'll get you about 40 miles on eight hours of charge.\nLevel 1 charging uses any 120-volt outlet---the standard type of electrical outlet in your home. The cost for that in 2022 will range from free if there's one already installed to around $300 to put one in. If your daily commute is under 40 miles, and you know you can recoup at least most of the lost charge from your driving by plugging it into a level 1 outlet for a few hours, you may not need to buy a home charging station at all. One caveat here, though: if you live in a cold climate, you'll likely use more power every day than you can replace with this level of charging.\nLevel 2 charging stations are more expensive, but also much faster than a level 1 wall outlet. A level 2 charger will get you around 40 miles worth of charge in an hour, so 4-6 times faster than a level 1 charge. Installation costs for a level 2 home EV charger can range from $300-$1200 on average, and they can be set up to charge one or two vehicles. You can get them mounted to the wall of your home, say in your garage, or purchase a portable one. Extras like Wi-Fi and other add-ons are available but not necessary and increase the cost. Level 2 stations require a 240-volt outlet to deliver that faster charge.\nA level 3 DCFC station will run you from $12,000-$35,000 for the charger and associated hardware. That cost makes them impractical for most homeowners to install, and a level 2 station is often more than enough. DCFC home stations usually require substantial remodeling to install the electrical infrastructure necessary to funnel enough power through to your EV for an 80% charge in half an hour---around 480 volts of output.\nWhether the station is hardwired into the wall or not also affects cost. It's slightly more expensive to get a portable station, but you get the benefit of not having to pay for installation again should the station need to be replaced. Portable stations plug into a 240-volt outlet installed in the wall and can be removed, whereas hardwired stations are basically boxes attached to the wall.\nLabor and Renovation Costs\nSometimes, especially if you have an older home, you might need to upgrade the electrical hardware before you can install a home EV charging station so as not to overload the circuit. As tech writer Brad Templeton outlines this in an article on the subject for Forbes:\n\"Older homes often have only 100 amps of service, and electrical codes don't let you exceed a given quota of devices and loads on them...if you get 80 amps worth of 240v devices on a 100A panel you probably go over the limit. If you have things like a 30 amp dryer, a 30 amp electric oven, or an air conditioner...you can easily go over the limit.\"\nTo solve that problem you would have to install a new power panel to bring in the necessary juice, plus run new wiring capable of carrying the load and install an outlet at the parking spot where you plan to charge the vehicle. You may also need to pay for trenching to be dug and power lines to be laid to a new outlet. All of that can get pretty expensive---Templeton quotes around $5,000.\nEven if extensive renovations aren't required, you'll still need to pay a professional to install the equipment. Electricians charge about $40-$100 an hour for their time, so you'll need to add that to the cost of equipment. In some cases, a slower charger that still qualifies as level 2, around 20-30amps, can be installed without the need for a new power panel, which can save you some cash.\nSome homes have 240-volt circuits already, and all that's needed is the outlet. In that case, it only costs $250-$400. If you have to run a 50 amp line and mount the outlet, it gets pricier.\nAround $600 of the cost of installation on a home EV charging station comes from labor costs---about half the total price. That said, if you aren't qualified, please do not try to do this yourself just to save some money.\nPermit Costs\nWhen putting in an EV home charging station it has to adhere to local, state, and federal building codes. The National Electrical Code (NEC), for example, sets the guidelines at the federal level to make sure electrical projects are installed safely and operate without hazards. Depending on what permits are required in your area, the cost for them can range from $50-$160.\nIncentives\nSome incentives are in place to help offset the cost of installation in an effort to promote greener transportation. Until 2021, the U.S. government offered an up to $1,000 tax credit toward the cost of buying and installing an EV charger at home. Some states still offer incentives, though they depend on where you live and qualifications vary by state. In Texas, for example, you can get about $250 off the cost of a level 2 or 3 home charger through the eTech program---but only if you're an Entergy customer.\nStipulations aside, this is worth looking into if you want to bring down the cost. Clipper Creek has a website you can search to find rebates in your state. Be sure to see whether the incentives apply to level 2 stations, as some of them only apply to level 3 DCFC installation.\nThe Bottom Line\nAll told, depending on the brand of charging station you install, you're looking at around $1,000-$1,500 total for level 2 EVSE on average. If you qualify for incentives, it could end up being less. Like most costs associated with EV ownership, it's steep upfront. But installing one can pay off in the long run in money saved on gas and public charging stations you have to pay for."

      "text": "Do EVs Cost More to Repair?\nIf you\u2019ve been thinking about purchasing an electric vehicle, you\u2019ve probably asked, \u201cdo EVs cost more to repair?\u201d\nIt\u2019s actually a two-part question. The first is, what is the average cost of ongoing EV service or maintenance? The second one is, what is the cost of repairing an electric car after it has been involved in an accident?\nLet\u2019s start with average maintenance costs for electric cars. EVs have way fewer moving parts, and are therefore not as complex to repair mechanically, when compared to a gasoline vehicle. Unlike a gas vehicle, EVs don\u2019t require thigs like engine oil changes every few months. In fact, EV maintenance basically amounts to replacing the cabin air filter, checking the windshield wipers, and rotating the tires. As such, EVs generally cost a lot less to maintain.\nUnlike gas-powered cars, most EVs will never need a coolant flush, a \u201ctune-up,\u201d or an oil change \u2013 and they have fewer moving parts that will eventually need to be replaced. They generally have single-speed transmissions and don\u2019t have spark plugs that need to be replaced. There\u2019s no muffler to go bad, no clutch, belt drives, hoses, or expensive catalytic converters to replace.\nIndeed, the federal Office of Energy Efficiency says that the average gasoline-powered vehicle costs ten cents per mile to maintain while EVs cost just six cents per mile. If you drive 15,000 miles per year, you\u2019ll likely save at least $1,500 per year on service and maintenance over a traditional vehicle.\nElectric Car Tires\nFor most electric cars, a 7,500-mile maintenance check might include various mechanical inspections, lubricating the door locks, topping off the coolant level for the battery pack, and checking the electric power converter, cabin heater, and charging module. But, one area you may need to pay increased attention is tires.\nHeavy batteries mean EVs can weigh significantly more than conventional cars \u2013 and EV tires are designed especially to handle that added weight. As such, they are generally more expensive than the tires found on gasoline vehicles. EV tires also can wear out sooner, partially because of how much torque and acceleration most EV cars have.\nTire manufacturers are now making EV-specific tires that have low rolling resistance to maximize range and tire life. Because of their unique composition, EV tires can cost 20 to 30 percent more than conventional tires.\nComparable Maintenance Costs\nAccording to Edmunds.com, the cost of maintaining an average electric car like a Chevrolet Bolt over a period of five years is approximately $2,800 \u2013 compared to over $4,400 for a gas-powered vehicle of similar size. However, luxury models tend to cost more to maintain, thanks to higher parts costs and more technology. Kelly Blue Book says a new Audi Q4 e-tron will cost just over $3,000 to maintain over a five-year period, while the gas-powered Q5 will cost over $5,000 \u2013 so an EV will still save you money over the same five years.\nWhile EVs cost less to maintain when compared to gas cars, they will still need new tires, wheel alignments, and tire rotations. While regenerative braking means that brake wear will be reduced, your brakes will still eventually need servicing, and you\u2019ll still need to eventually replace or repair suspension components. As for the battery pack that powers an EV, the batteries don\u2019t require maintenance and are generally made to last longer than the car itself \u2013 with warranties* averaging eight to 10 years.\nBut while EVs cost less to service, what about the costs of repairing an electric vehicle that has been in an accident?\nEV Crash Repair Costs\nA recent study on repair costs found that the average accident repair cost for EVs is about $950 higher than for gasoline cars. But, a large part of the extra expense had to do with the higher repair costs of Tesla models \u2013 which dominate the electric car market. For comparison, the average cost of repairing a non-Tesla EV was only $269 higher than the average gas car.\nIn fact, the study found that overall, EVs are not particularly more expensive to repair \u2013 but that the real difference may have more to do with the fact that EVs are heavier than ICE vehicles and thus, sustain more damage in a collision. The increased weight means that the other car involved in a crash will sustain more damage as well.\nOne positive: EVs in the study had fewer claims than gasoline cars, and fewer reported collisions. EV accident claims were actually 19 percent lower than gasoline-powered cars.\nA True Tesla Story\nWe\u2019ve all heard stories about Tesla maintenance and repairs. The automaker is unique in the way it handles problems with vehicles. This story comes to us from GreenCars\u2019 own Taylor Faust, who owns a Tesla Model S.\nTaylor bought his Model S used in 2018. Four months later, while driving to Medford, Oregon, his Tesla flashed a warning that said it would stop working when it was next shut off. Taylor drove to a Tesla charging station, turned the vehicle off, and just as he was warned, it would not turn back on. He went to the Tesla app on his smartphone, and under \u201cservice\u201d was connected with an agent from Tesla.\nThey tried to start the vehicle remotely, but based on the prompts from the car, Taylor was told a tow truck would be dispatched to tow his Model S to one of the brand\u2019s service centers in Bend, Oregon \u2013 three hours away. The car was under warranty, so the tow was free \u2013 as was the repair for whatever electronic devils were menacing the car. However, Taylor would have to travel to Bend on his own dime to pick up the vehicle himself.\n\u201cOnce the car was at the Service Center, a technician was assigned to it, and I was really pleased with the level of service. I would get texts nearly every day telling me when new parts were ordered, when they arrived, and when they would be installed,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cA week and a half later, my whole family drove to Bend and the service manager handed me the keys saying, \u2018You\u2019re good to go.\u2019 The whole experience gave me a lot of faith in Tesla.\u201d\nHowever, when it comes to repairing damage from an accident, the story is often not so rosy. Sometime later, Taylor\u2019s neighbor accidently backed into his Model S, denting and twisting the front bumper. It looked like a simple enough repair \u2013 but Teslas use aluminum body panels, and replacing a small part can actually be a big deal, and very expensive to make right. Taylor tells us that the whole invoice for the repair was over $17,000. Good thing his neighbor had proper insurance.\nOverall insurance claims on the Model S are 2.4 times higher than the average for all Tesla vehicles \u2013 but that is not unusual for a high-end luxury car.\nDriving Higher Repair Costs\nWhy are repair costs for EVs higher than traditional gas cars? Some of the expense comes from the cost of highly advanced driver assist technologies that are making cars more efficient and safer. Plus, damaged tech hardware often cannot be repaired \u2013 and must be replaced at great expense.\nEV repairs use up to 90 percent manufacturer-sourced parts, which are more expensive than third-party parts from the aftermarket \u2013 and 77 percent of EVs are upscale luxury models that cost more to repair anyway. Then there\u2019s the \u201cnew tech\u201d factor of using the electric vehicle brand\u2019s service centers to handle the repairs, due to the training needed to safely handle EV battery packs.\nIndeed, more hours of labor are needed for EV crash repairs \u2013 and that can contribute to a big chunk of the total bill. When an EV has been in an accident, the battery needs to be de-energized and removed. As the most expensive component in an EV, the battery pack is the main factor in a vehicle being written off as a total loss \u2013 which can happen even after a minor collision.\nThe Bottom Line\nA recent study in the industry trade publication Automotive News revealed statistics from Mitchell, a software company specializing in the collision repair industry. The study compared average repair costs for EVs compared to ICE cars. Interestingly, the news was largely positive for EVs. As mentioned earlier, repair totals for EVs were only $269 more, averaging six percent over the cost of repairing an average ICE vehicle. So, for most EVs, minor collisions should not be a major concern for owners.\nPlus, as EVs continue to populate our roads, vehicle purchase prices and repair costs should continue to decline.\n*See dealer for limited warranty details"

      "text": "Hyundai did its homework. The Korean automaker officially unveiled the IONIQ 5, a revolutionary electric vehicle and the first product under its IONIQ sub-brand. The IONIQ 5 has an advanced AR heads-up display, can travel nearly 300 miles on a charge, and can power refrigerators, microwaves, camping gear, and other appliances from a power adapter.\nDesign-wise, the IONIQ 5 builds on Hyundai's \"45\" concept EV unveiled in 2019. It's a futuristic hatchback with a cozy interior, a moveable center console, two driver displays, and a grill-less front end (most EV manufacturers stick fake grills on their cars). Hyundai says that the IONIQ 5 is inspired by South Korea's first mass-produced and exported car, the classic Hyundai Pony, and you can see some similarities in the cars' design language (especially the interior).\nBut unlike the Hyundai Pony, which failed emissions guidelines and never released in the US, the IONIQ 5 reeks of sustainability. Its interior is made of eco-friendly PET and recycled materials, and its roof is fitted with a solar panel which should help extend your battery life, especially if you park outdoors.\nYou and I might call the IONIQ 5 a hatchback, but Hyundai calls it a CUV (crossover utility vehicle). This is thanks to its unique two-way charging system, which allows you to power appliances from your car. The IONIQ 5 has two 3.6kW V2L ports to provide external power to appliances. While most people will use this feature for camping or running PA systems, it could also come in handy when your power goes out.\nIONIQ 5 is the first vehicle built on Hyundai's Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), meaning that it's good for 300 miles on a single charge and supports both 400V and 800V charging. With a 350kW charger, the IONIQ 5 can charge from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes, and you only need to charge for 5 minutes to get an extra 62 miles of range. Customers can choose between 58kWh or 72.6kWh batteries and rear-only or all-wheel drive. The smaller battery has about 200 miles of travel, while the larger battery can go at least 270 miles.\nHyundai says the IONIQ 5 will go on sale in select regions (probably Korea and parts of Europe) during the first half of 2021. While there's no official word on pricing, rumors suggest that the IONIQ 5 will start somewhere in the $30,000 range and extend to the $40,000 or $50,000 range when you pay for the bigger battery, the all-wheel drive, and add-on features.\nSource: Hyundai via electrek, Wirecutter"

      "text": "Summary\n- Aftermarket head units with Android Auto and CarPlay can be complicated to install.\n- Portable head units are cheap, easy to use, and don't require installation.\n- Portable head units may even have bonus features that built-in systems don't have.\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay have been around for a while, but not all of us drive vehicles with the technology built in. Of course, you could install an aftermarket head unit yourself, but that can be intimidating. There's actually a much easier way to do it\u2014no wiring required.\nReplacing a Head Unit Can Be Complicated\nThere's no shortage of aftermarket head units with Android Auto and CarPlay for a wide variety of vehicles. Even my ancient 2009 Chevy Silverado allegedly has compatible models. However, there are a couple of things that have always held me back, and maybe you feel the same way.\nFor starters, I'm an avid DIYer, but I am out of my depths when it comes to vehicles. I can read tutorials and watch videos all day, but ripping out a chunk of my vehicle's interior is still an intimidating prospect. I'm never comfortable working with electricity and wiring.\nThe other problem is I could never be 100% positive that what I saw online was indeed compatible with my truck. My specific make and model were very difficult to find on compatibility lists, and I couldn't find examples of people with my exact vehicle in the reviews. This always left me feeling uncertain, so I lived with a janky Spotify Car Thing as an alternative.\nPortable Head Units Are Cheap and Easy to Use\nIn the last year or so, \"portable\" head units with Android Auto and CarPlay have exploded on Amazon. Back when I bought the Car Thing, I remember thinking a similar device with Android Auto would be awesome, and now they're readily available.\n\"Portable,\" in this case, simply means the device is not a permanent, built-in part of your vehicle. They're essentially a modern-day version of a GPS that you might find on the dashboards of a car in the early 2000s. You get all the convenience of Android Auto or CarPlay in a compact package. The \"installation\" consists of finding the best way to mount it and plugging in the charging and aux cable.\nThe exact model I bought was only $45\u2014which is much cheaper than any built-in model I found that might work with my vehicle. It has a 7-inch touch screen and comes with a number of mounting options and cables. In just a couple of minutes, I had a fully functional Android Auto display in my 15-year-old rusty truck.\nYou May Even Get Bonus Features\nThe interesting thing about many of these portable Android Auto/CarPlay devices is they always seem to have more features than what you get in vehicles that come with the tech built-in.\nFor example, my partner drives a 2019 Ford Escape with an infotainment system that has Android Auto and CarPlay built-in. However, it does not support wireless connections. You must connect your phone with a USB cable or buy a wireless dongle. Meanwhile, my $45 device supports wireless connections out of the box.\nAnother thing that my portable screen has is AirPlay and \"Android Cast.\" Technically, I could cast videos to the screen for passengers to watch. I don't think I will ever actually use the feature, but it's not something you'd find built into many vehicles (unless Google has something to say about it).\nPortable head units are a great way to add Android Auto and CarPlay to any car, even older models. They're easy to install and often come with bonus features not found in built-in systems. If you're looking to upgrade your car's infotainment system without the hassle, a portable head unit is a great option. I'm glad I did."

      "text": "The Tesla Model Y is the world's best-selling EV, so there are certainly many people out there who are concerned about the cost of Model Y battery replacement. Whether you're a Model Y owner or just curious about this aspect of EV ownership, we're here to help.\nA crossover with lots of positive features, it's no surprise the Model Y is so popular. The crossover has lots of space, offers excellent performance and decent range, and it's competitively priced, too. In the US, the Model Y is available in three trims: Long Range RWD, Long Range AWD, and Performance (AWD). Both powertrains\u2014RWD and Dual Motor (AWD)\u2014are equipped with a unique battery capacity, creating a balanced pricing strategy without compromising estimated range figures.\nNot everyone buying a Tesla Model Y plans to own it long-term, but if you do, it's worth knowing what it'll cost you to replace the battery pack when it reaches the end of its lifespan. If EV ownership is unfamiliar territory, you'll be pleased to know that understanding the costs associated with replacing the Model Y's battery is relatively easy. But, as you can imagine, it does come at a substantial cost.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from the Tesla website and other authoritative sources, including the EPA and J.D. Power.\nHow Much A New Tesla Model Y Battery Costs\nIf you plan on owning a Tesla Model Y long term, it's important you understand the costs associated with replacing the battery pack. If the battery were to fail outside your warranty, you can expect to fork out anywhere between $12,000 and $20,000 to have it replaced. The costs really depends on the battery's capacity and how severe the degradation is, as Tesla doesn't replace the entire battery pack\u2014instead it replaces select faulty modules.\nOf course, you can have the battery pack repaired or replaced at an independent workshop for cheaper, but it's highly recommended that you stick with the manufacturer for not only the best results, but for the brand's stamp of approval in your service book.\nHow The Tesla Model Y Battery Is Replaced\nTo be fair, it's money well spent, as Tesla's technicians follow a precise process to replace battery modules when the battery pack reaches the end of its lifespan or experiences a failure. This starts with them performing a diagnostic test to confirm the issue, checking the battery management system, and running appropriate tests to identify the damaged or degraded modules.\nUnless a full battery pack replacement is required, only the affected modules are replaced, in order to preserve the rest of the pack.To do this, the technicians must disconnect the vehicle from its power sources and ensure safety protocols are followed, as working with high-voltage systems requires caution. As the battery pack is located underneath the car, the vehicle must be lifted to access it.\nTo remove the entire pack from the chassis, technicians use specialized tools. The battery pack contains several modules, each made up of individual cells. Damaged cells are replaced with new ones and, after installation, the pack is then resealed and reinstalled in the vehicle.\nThe entire system is then tested to ensure proper functioning, including checking the battery's thermal management, charging capabilities, and overall performance. Technicians then update the car's software to recalibrate the battery management system to recognize the new modules.\nTesla's replacement process ensures the Model Y's performance and range remain optimal without the need for full battery pack replacement, reducing both costs and environmental impact. Speaking of the latter\u2014Tesla prioritizes sustainability, so the old modules are either recycled or repurposed for energy storage systems.\nUnderstanding The Tesla Model Y's Different Battery Options\nThe Tesla Model Y was previously available with a 57.5-kWh Prismatic LFP battery in the base rear-wheel drive (Standard) model. However, the model was replaced with a rear-wheel drive option (Long Range) with an extended battery pack. In Long Range trim, the vehicle features a more powerful dual-motor all-wheel drive system and a larger, 2170 79-kWh battery. The Performance trim\u2014sitting at the top of the range\u2014features the same battery pack but a more powerful set of dual motors.\nThe American EV producer sources all of its batteries from Panasonic, and has done so for more than a decade. The Japanese energy company works with Tesla to further push the boundaries of battery technology, including exploring sold-state chemistries. Further, Panasonic is also developing a production facility close to Tesla's Texas plant, so that it can improve the manufacturer's supply chain, leading to faster and more efficient distribution times.\n|\nLong Range RWD |\nLong Range AWD |\nPerformance |\n|\n|\nPrice |\n$31,490 |\n$34,490 |\n$37,990 |\n|\nPowertrain |\nSingle Permanent-Magnet Motor |\nDual Permanent-Magnet Motors |\nDual Permanent-Magnet Motors |\n|\nTransmission |\nSingle-Speed Automatic |\nSingle-Speed Automatic |\nSingle-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n295 HP |\n384 HP |\n456 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n310 LB-FT |\n376 LB-FT |\n497 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRear-Wheel Drive |\nAll-Wheel Drive |\nAll-Wheel Drive |\n|\nBattery |\n82 kWh Net |\n82 kWh Net |\n82 kWh Net |\n|\nRange |\n320 Miles |\n310 Miles |\n279 Miles |\n|\nFast Charging Time |\n25 Minutes |\n27 Minutes |\n27 Minutes |\n|\nEnergy Consumption |\n28 kWh/100 Miles |\n28 kWh/100 Miles |\n28 kWh/100 Miles |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n6.5 seconds |\n4.8 seconds |\n3.5 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n135 MPH |\n135 MPH |\n155 MPH |\nHow Long A Tesla Model Y Battery Lasts\nGenerally speaking, EV batteries have a lifespan of between eight and 10 years. Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, claims that the brand's batteries can last up to 500,000 miles. However, current Model S and Model X users say 200,000 is a more realistic figure.\nThe Model Y uses lithium-iron-phosphate and lithium-ion batteries, which are supposedly designed to last between 300,000 and 500,000 miles with regular use, depending on driving habits and environmental conditions. 150,000 to 200,000 miles is a more realistic figure, though.\nTesla's battery warranty is comprehensive, with the brand covering all defects within the first eight years or 120,000 miles, and even replacing the battery if it loses 70 percent of its charge within this time.\nTo help extend the battery's lifespan, proper maintenance, such as avoiding extreme charging habits or prolonged exposure to high temperatures, should be observed. Although battery degradation occurs gradually, Tesla's battery management system optimizes charging and discharging to preserve battery health.\nTesla's Comprehensive Battery Warranty\nAll new Model Y sales include Tesla's new vehicle limited warranty package. That means you get a four-year or 50,000-mile basic warranty, a 12-year and unlimited-mile corrosion warranty, a five-year or 60,000-mile restrain system warranty, and an eight-year or 120,000-mile for all-electric drive systems. Further, Tesla guarantees its battery will retain 70 percent of its charge during this period.\n|\nType |\nDuration |\n|\nFull Warranty |\nFour Years/50,000 Miles |\n|\nPowertrain Warranty |\nEight Years/120,000 Miles |\n|\nMaintenance Warranty |\n0 Months/0 Miles |\n|\nRoadside Warranty |\nFour Years/50,000 Miles |\n|\nCorrosion Warranty |\n12 Years/150,000 Miles |\n|\nFederal Emissions Performance |\nTwo Years/24,000 Miles |\n|\nFederal Emissions Defect |\n36 Months/36,000 Miles |\n|\nSeat Belt and Airbags |\nFive Years/60,000 Miles |\nDefects in materials and workmanship relating to the battery and drive unit are covered under warranty. Tesla guarantees that during the period, the battery will maintain at least 70 percent of its original capacity. Should the battery degrade below this level or fail due to a manufacturing defect, Tesla will either repair or replace the battery pack at no charge.\nAlso included in the warranty are labor costs for any necessary repairs. However, it doesn't include damage caused by misuse, accidents, intentional abuse, or non-Tesla modifications. Further, if the owner fails to follow Tesla's recommended charging guidelines or if the battery is damaged due to environmental factors such as flooding, those issues fall outside the scope of warranty coverage."

      "text": "EVs were once a niche choice, but with the world clearly moving towards electrification and infrastructure growing, their value proposition is becoming more and more clear. However, with so many great options on the market right now, it\u2019s hard to figure out who offers the best bang for your buck.\nThere are a number of key players in the EV market right now, all looking to innovate and offer unmatched value for money. However, there is one automaker that we feel is truly building practical and comfortable electric vehicles for the average person, and that is Hyundai with their fantastic Ioniq line.\nWe dive into the model in Hyundai\u2019s line of fantastic electric vehicles which we think offers the most comprehensive package for your money of any EV right now. We explore which trim in particular would suit you best as well as how powerful and efficient it is and how comfortable its cabin can be.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Hyundai websites and other authoritative sources, including TopSpeed and the EPA.\nHyundai's Ioniq 5 is Priced Perfectly and Comes Loaded With Features\nWhen it comes to compact SUVs, there is a plethora of options on the market right now that perform exceptionally well. However, none quite offer the value proposition that you'll find within Hyundai's Ioniq 5. This little crossover has a clearly defined goal within the market, to provide a fun, practical, and quirky SUV, which it executes on to near perfection.\n2025 Trims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nSE Standard Range |\n$42,600 |\n|\nSE |\n$46,650 |\n|\nSEL |\n$49,600 |\n|\nLimited |\n$54,300 |\n|\nXRT |\n$55,500 |\nAt just over $40,000, the Ioniq 5 is not the most affordable option in the compact SUV segment, rather it sits near the middle of the pack. However, as is becoming expected in Hyundai's fleet, this crossover comes loaded with features from the word go, with the best value coming in trims near the more affordable side of the ladder, with the range-toppers being more niche.\nThe SE and SEL represent the base offerings, and focus more on fulfilling the mission statement of this little EV. They come fitted with plenty of comfort and tech features and the cabin exudes playfulness. Bump up to the Limited mode, and you'll gain access to some real luxury features, like leatherette upholstery and heated seats. The XRT trim is particularly interesting, though, offering a suspension lift and all-terrain tires for those looking for adventure.\nBest Value For Money Trim\nWhile the Ioniq 5 offers tons of value, there are certain models you should stay away from. The base SE with the standard range battery is one of those models. While not horrible, it is less powerful than every other trim, by quite a lot, and its range is actually a little bit disappointing. Every other model, however, comes with an upgraded battery.\nWhile the Limited will certainly attract those looking for comfort and the XRT will satisfy outdoorsy buyers, the average person will find that the SEL offers the best balance of performance, features, and price. The SEL comes standard with features like front and rear parking sensors, adaptive cruise control with lane centering, and a heated steering wheel, among other things, which more than justify the jump in price.\nChanges For 2025\nThe Hyundai Ioniq 5 has been easy to recommend since its debut in 2022. The Korean automaker, however, understands the need to evolve quickly, particularly in the electric vehicle segment. Hence, they have updated their compact crossover in some very meaningful ways, starting with upgrading the larger battery on offer from 77.4 kWh to 84.0 kWh.\nAlongside this, the Ioniq 5 also now comes with an NACS charging port, with a CCS adapter being included as well. The adventurous XRT trim that we mentioned earlier also makes its debut this year. All models across the board benefit from updated front and rear bumper changes, including a rear windshield wiper, which was admittedly an odd exclusion in previous model years. There has also been a slew of changes to the interior, including an update to the infotainment system.\nThe Ioniq 5 Can Now Go Farther On A Single Charge\nThanks to the aforementioned upgrade to the battery pack in the Ioniq 5, Hyundai's compact crossover now offers more value than before by being able to go further before you need to recharge. This is especially useful due to the perky powertrain used in everything other than the base model. The compact crossover is fun to drive and impressively efficient.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nPowertrain |\n1x Electric Motor |\n1x Electric Motor |\n2x Electric Motor |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nHorsepower |\n168 HP |\n225 HP |\n320 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n258 LB-FT |\n258 LB-FT |\n446 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD |\nRWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.5 Seconds |\n7.4 Seconds |\n4.5 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n117 MPH |\n117 MPH |\n117 MPH |\nIf you go with the base SE Standard Range model, you get a single motor mounted to the rear axle that delivers fairly unexciting acceleration, on par with more mundane gas-powered rivals. Every other model, bar the XRT, comes standard with a more powerful rear-wheel setup that feels much peppier. If you're really looking for speed, though, the all-wheel-drive setup is the way to go.\nThe Ioniq 5 delivers an impressively smooth ride. It features a fairly low center of gravity and wider tires than most EVs, making it feel lively and athletic when hitting corners. Steering feedback is the main drawback, with it feeling a little dull. However, overall, the Ioniq 5 is really enjoyable to drive, and even if you do opt for the least powerful model, its quirky attitude will certainly win you over.\nRange, Efficiency, and Charging\n|\nModel |\nCity |\nHighway |\nCombined |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nRWD Standard Range |\n131 MPGe |\n100 MPGe |\n115 MPGe |\n|\nRWD |\n129 MPGe |\n100 MPGe |\n114 MPGe |\n|\nAWD (19-inch wheels) |\n116 MPGe |\n96 MPGe |\n106 MPGe |\n|\nAWD (20-inch wheels) |\n108 MPGe |\n88 MPGe |\n98 MPGe |\n|\nAWD XRT |\n84 MPGe |\n72 MPGe |\n78 MPGe |\nIf you opt for the most affordable SE Standard Range, you get yourself access to a 63 kWh battery pack. This model uses its battery more efficiently than other models but will only take you 245 miles on a single charge. While this isn't horrible, other models instead come with an 84 kWh battery pack, providing a decent amount more range. Stick with rear-wheel drive, and you'll be able to go up to 318 miles on a charge. All-wheel drive models, however, go up to 290 miles when equipped with 19-inch wheels and 269 miles with 20-inch wheels. The XRT model is rated for a range of 221 miles.\nWhen it comes to charging, the Ioniq 5 continues to impress. When plugged in to a DC fast charger with the CCS adapter, Hyundai claims that the compact crossover can charge from 10 to 80 percent in 20 minutes. If you charge for five minutes, Hyundai says you can add up to 68 miles to your overall range, which is pretty impressive.\nHyundai Has Integrated Plenty of Tech Into The Ioniq 5's Cabin\nTechnology is becoming increasingly important to car buyers, with a digital revolution overtaking the automotive world right now. Hyundai is at the forefront of this wave in a lot of ways, which really shines through in the cabin of the Ioniq 5. While very forward-thinking, it also still manages to retain the essence of what makes a car comfortable and warm, instead of cold and calculating.\nDesign, Comfort, and Cargo\nThe Ioniq 5 features a neat interior, with everything kind of pointing towards the driver. The Korean crossover makes use of a number of high-quality materials that are both alluring and eco-friendly, without shoving the latter in your face too much. While there is plenty of tech and digital real estate, Hyundai has also included plenty of physical controls, which fits the more retro theme of the car as well as being more attractive than full touch control.\nHyundai's Ioniq 5 features a wheelbase that is actually longer than the Palisade. If you haven't seen one in person, it is deceptively large. There is tons of space for front and rear passengers, as well as plenty of room for cargo. Hyundai has obviously also kept comfort at the forefront of their minds, with neat features like reclining front seats with foot rests that allow you to kick back while you charge.\nInfotainment and Technology\nWhen it comes to connectivity, Hyundai's Ioniq line really does a fantastic job. The Ioniq 5 comes standard with two screens which share a bezel; a 12-inch infotainment screen and a 12-inch digital gauge cluster. The infotainment system supports wireless connection for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and features things like voice recognition as well.\nCertain models allow you to control core functions, such as charging, from your smartphone, as well as allowing you to use your smartphone as a key. Models also come with an integrated wireless charging pad for your phone. Ambient lighting and a premium Bose sound system are also available, along with dual-zone climate control."
