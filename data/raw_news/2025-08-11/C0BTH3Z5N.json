I was angry. I said I was going to threaten them... I'll maybe just shoot or something. I had no idea. I mean, I was just threatening. What I wanted to do, and not with a gun, I would go in, find out where the rough cut is, and break the windows and take it away. They were going to destroy the film anyway, you know. So let me destroy it. I'll destroy it. But before destroying it, I'm going to steal it.\"\n\n\"Spielberg said, 'Marty, stop that. Marty you can't do that.' I said... The more they said no, the more I said I was going to do it,\" he continues.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nSpielberg said someone, possibly Scorsese, \"mollified\" the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\n\"What if we take that whole sequence and tone the color down and make it feel more like a tabloid,\" Scorsese said.\n\n\"He saved the movie because he didn't have to cut any of the violence, he just had to take the color red down to a kind of brown,\" Spielberg explained.\n\nA representative for Scorsese did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nThe film, which starred Jodie Foster and Robert De Niro, received four nominations at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (De Niro) and Best Supporting Actress (Foster).\n\nIn 2024, Foster \u2014 who has been acting since she was 3 years old \u2014 opened up about her experience filming the thriller.\n\n\"I first worked with Martin Scorsese when I was about 10 on \u2018Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore,'\" she said in an interview with W magazine. \"By the time I was 12, I\u2019d made a lot more films than De Niro or Scorsese.\"\n\n\"They were definitely scared of me. \u2018What do we do with this 12-year-old?\u2019 I was in my hot pants and corkies, or whatever those platform shoes were called.\"\n\nFoster played a child prostitute in the 1976 drama.

      "text": "Jodie Foster Is Done Competing With Her Past\nThe Oscar winner talks Nyad, True Detective and aging in Hollywood.\nAt 61, Jodie Foster is having more fun professionally than she ever has before. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of contentedness that you have,\u201d she says of entering her sixth decade. Fittingly, her latest film, the biopic Nyad, in which Foster plays long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad\u2019s (Annette Bening) best friend and coach, Bonnie Stoll, is a triumph not just for its depiction of Nyad\u2019s historic swim from Cuba to Florida at 64 years old, but also for how it celebrates the immutable bond of two women of a certain age. \u201cThere's something really beautiful about this long-term friendship,\u201d Foster tells W\u2019s editor at large, Lynn Hirschberg. \u201cThey've been friends for over 40 years. They were lovers a hundred years ago when they were kids, and they stayed together as a family. They see each other every single day\u2014even today.\u201d Here, Foster discusses the film, for which she received Golden Globe and Critics Choice Awards nominations, her new season of HBO Max\u2019s True Detective: Night Country, and defying her mother\u2019s expectations.\nHow did Nyad come into your life?\nI knew Bonnie and Diana for years, running into them at Christmas parties and barbecues, and I just loved them. I thought they were quirky and interesting. And then Diana\u2019s amazing feat happened\u2014swimming 110 miles from Cuba to Florida. When they approached me with the script, I couldn\u2019t resist.\nDo you like water?\nI love the ocean, but I don\u2019t really like to swim; I don\u2019t like to put my head underwater. So that was good for Nyad: All I had to do was stand on the boat and scream at her.\nAnd wear a lot of sunblock.\nI do wear a lot of sunblock, although Bonnie does not believe in sunblock. There is one moment in the film where she takes, like, a ChapStick that has sunblock in it and puts it on the tip of her nose. That's about the only bit of sunblock that Bonnie has ever seen. Diana says that Bonnie is a tanorexic, which, if you actually take that apart etymologically, makes no sense. But Bonnie is addicted to tanning.\nWhen you did Silence of the Lambs, few serious actresses were cast in horror films. Were people surprised when Silence of the Lambs swept the Oscars, winning all the major awards?\nWe didn\u2019t expect that at all! We were backstage at the Oscars, kind of sweating all over each other. I already had an Oscar [for The Accused], but that was for a film where I was the only one nominated. So Silence was a completely different experience.\nHow old were you when you started acting?\nThree. I did my first movie at 6.\nWhat was the hardest transition agewise during your career?\nThe biggest transition was going from being a young person, to college, and then becoming an adult actor. The work that I did between 16 and 22\u2014that is the most awkward place. But my mom just kept telling me, \"By the time you're 40, you'll never work again, so you should work as much as you can now because by the time you're 40, you'll be over.\" Now I've never been busier. The fifties are awkward, especially for an actress. People don't know what to do with you, and you don't know what to do with you. You're completely confused about what your relevance is in the world. You just keep trying to compete with your past and who you used to be. And suddenly, sixties, the perfect thing happens: At 60, you suddenly realize you don't care about all the things that you cared about in your fifties. You get to support other people because you know it's not your time. There's something about being the wise one in the room that it's just so much more fun.\nWhen we last spoke, you mentioned that in some ways you were the wise one in the room in Taxi Driver, and you were only 12.\nI first worked with Martin Scorsese when I was about 10, on Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore. By the time I was 12, I\u2019d made a lot more films than De Niro or Scorsese. They were definitely scared of me: \u201cWhat do we do with this 12-year-old?\u201d I was in my hot pants and corkies, or whatever those platform shoes were called.\nYou\u2019re starring in the latest season of True Detective premiering this month. What can you tell us about it?\nI've seen all the True Detectives, and of course, season 1 is pretty awesome. But our season, season four, is my favorite, of course. We shot in Iceland, in the freezing cold, and I couldn't have loved it more. There\u2019s a great groundedness and humor to it for a show that has this eerie quality and some scares here and there. It really centers the Indigenous experience, this place in Alaska that so many of us in the lower 49, which is the United States, don't know very well.\nAre you a Halloween dress-up person?\nAre you kidding me? I\u2019m a huge Halloween fan. I was a Smurf for many years. I kept my Smurf mask until it smelled really bad.\nWhich Smurf were you?\nPapa Smurf, of course! With the beard and the blue and the whole thing.\nDo you have a go-to karaoke song?\nI do not. When my first son was born, I used to sing to him \"Big Spender.\u201d That seemed to be the song that I sang to him in his bassinet. So that would probably be my karaoke song.\nWhat astrological sign are you?\nScorpio. Scorpios are strong, hypersexualized. They are attackers, and they\u2019re quite the fighters. They can be vindictive. [Laughs] That\u2019s me. Ready?\nSenior Style Editor: Allia Alliata di Montereale. Senior Fashion Market Editor and Menswear Director: Jenna Wojciechowski.

      "text": "Jodie Foster has been making some bold comments recently.\nThe actress, 61, has been acting steadily since she was 3 years old. Because of this, she was something of a veteran by the time she filmed \"Taxi Driver\" with Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese.\nThough she was only 12 years old when she made the movie, she says now her experience scared them.\n\"I first worked with Martin Scorsese when I was about 10 on \u2018Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore,'\" she said in a new interview with W magazine. \"By the time I was 12, I\u2019d made a lot more films than De Niro or Scorsese.\n\"They were definitely scared of me. \u2018What do we do with this 12-year-old?\u2019 I was in my hot pants and corkies, or whatever those platform shoes were called.\"\nFoster played a child prostitute in the 1976 drama. De Niro was 31 during filming, and he'd been acting for around a decade. Scorsese had directed seven full-length films and a number of shorts.\nAlthough she has had a successful career from a young age, it struck many as odd that she'd say De Niro and Scorsese, who have been successful for decades, would be \"scared\" of her in that sense.\nMore comments she's made recently have been raising some eyebrows too. In an interview last week with The Guardian, she shared some critical thoughts about Gen Z.\n\"They\u2019re really annoying, especially in the workplace,\" she complained. \"They\u2019re like, \u2018Nah, I\u2019m not feeling it today, I\u2019m gonna come in at 10:30 a.m.\u2019 Or, like, in emails, I\u2019ll tell them this is all grammatically incorrect. Did you not check your spelling? And they\u2019re like, \u2018Why would I do that, isn\u2019t that kind of limiting?\u2019\"\nIn an appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" this week, she attempted to clarify that statement, saying, \"I got some grief from my sons for that one. Yeah, you know, \u2018cause you\u2019re older, and you tend to do that, \u2018Well in my day, we had to walk to school with crampons on,\u2019 or something.\n\"But the new generation, you know, they\u2019re lucky, because they learned that they could say no, and we didn\u2019t know that. We didn\u2019t have a kind of freedom, and there\u2019s a double edge to that. There\u2019s things you learn when you\u2019re unfree and overly disciplined.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

They\u2019re super feminist.\n\"And there was a moment with my older one when he was in high school, when, because he was raised by two women \u2014 three women \u2014 it was like he was trying to figure out what it was to be a boy. And he watched television and came to the conclusion, \u2018Oh, I just need to be an a------. I understand! I need to be s----- to women, and act like I\u2019m a f-----.\u2019\n\"And I was like, no! That\u2019s not what it is to be a man! That\u2019s what our culture has been selling you for all this time,\" she remembered saying.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAfter Foster said that this phase lasted for six months, she was asked if she let it play out.\n\"Yes and no,\" she responded. \"I was like, \u2018You won\u2019t be talking to me like that.\u2019\""

      "text": "Steven Spielberg is an American director and writer best known for his bestselling blockbuster films and for creating some of the most recognizable movies of all time. Spielberg has won multiple accolades and awards for his work in cinema and is considered by many to be one of the greatest directors of his generation. The level of success and popularity of his films has helped make him the most commercially successful director in the history of film.\nThe Ohio native first started out his career by working as a director in television for projects such as \"Night Gallery\" and \"Columbo.\" Spielberg did not release his first movie until 1974 with \"The Sugarland Express.\" However, it was 1975's \"Jaws\" that helped Spielberg rise in fame as the movie dominated the franchise. Furthermore, the success of \"Jaws\" was followed up by \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" in 1982 and the directing for the entire \"Indiana Jones\" movie series.\nSpielberg's other movies throughout the years include \"The Color Purple\" in 1982, \"Jurassic Park\" in 1993, \"Saving Private Ryan\" in 1998, and \"War of the Worlds\" in 2005. Spielberg has worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, such as Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks. He is the co-founder of DreamWorks and Amblin Entertainment, which are studios that have produced dozens of high-profile movies and blockbuster hits. He is considered one of the richest directors of all time with a reported net worth estimated to be over $8 billion.\nHe has numerous awards that include three Academy Awards and AFI Life Achievement Award. More than a half dozen of his movies were put into the Library of Congress's National Film Registry. For over four decades since the start of Spielberg's career, he has continued to write and direct newly released movies that are often at the top of the box office."
