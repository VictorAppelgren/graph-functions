  "content": "NYON, Switzerland \u2014 UEFA opened a disciplinary case Friday after an Israeli soccer club\u2019s fans displayed a banner targeting Poland that was criticized by the Polish president and diplomats from Israel.\n\nFallout from the Maccabi Haifa vs. Rakow Czestochowa game Thursday in UEFA\u2019s Conference League adds to current scrutiny around non-sporting issues being aired at international soccer.\n\nThe slogan \u201cMurderers since 1939\u201d in English was shown by Maccabi Haifa fans at a qualifying game in UEFA\u2019s Conference League against Polish team Rakow. It was quickly condemned by the president of Poland and Israel\u2019s embassy in the country.\n\nPolish President Karol Nawrocki posted on X the banner was \u201cscandalous\u201d and an insult to Polish victims of World War Two including three million Jews.\n\nMaccabi Haifa and Rakow played the game in neutral Hungary - instead of Israel for security reasons - one week after the first leg in Poland. There, Rakow fans showed a banner in Polish saying Israel was murdering people and the world was silent.\n\nUEFA said Friday both clubs have been charged with \u201ctransmitting a message not fit for a sports event\u201d in a case that will be judged by its disciplinary panel.\n\nNo timetable was given for imposing sanctions which could be fines and closing part of a stadium at a future game. Rakow won 2-0 Thursday and eliminated Maccabi Haifa 2-1 on aggregate score.\n\nThe Polish government\u2019s foreign ministry said Friday it had spoken with Israel\u2019s ambassador to the country, Yaakov Finkelstein.\n\n\u201cHe expressed his utmost outrage at the scandalous content of a banner displayed by the Israeli fans and thanked for its firm condemnation by the embassy,\u201d the Polish ministry said in a statement.\n\nPoland\u2019s ambassador in Israel also was set to discuss the incident with Israel\u2019s government, the ministry said, adding: \u201cPolish-Israeli relations must not, and will not, be undermined by extremists.\u201d\n\nUEFA does not allow overt political messaging by fans or clubs in stadiums at European competition games it organizes but was itself criticized this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, UEFA displayed the message \u201cStop Killing Children. Stop Killing Civilians\u201d on the field before its showpiece Super Cup game between the Champion League title holder Paris Saint-Germain and Europa League winner Tottenham, played at Udine, Italy.\n\nUEFA said it was part of a campaign with its charitable foundation that has projects helping children affected by conflicts also in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine.\n\nWhen the PSG and Tottenham players were presented with their medals, the post-game ceremony involved two Palestinian children who are refugees in Italy from Gaza.\n\nAt the Champions League final played in Munich in May, PSG fans displayed a banner \u201cStop Genocide in Gaza\u201d in English. UEFA did not punish the Qatari-owned French club for the display.",

The Polish government and Israeli ambassador expressed outrage, and both clubs were charged with transmitting a message not fit for a sports event, with possible fines or stadium closures pending. The incident follows a week\u2011long clash in which Rakow fans also displayed a banner accusing Israel of murder. UEFA has faced criticism for its own political messaging, having recently shown anti\u2011violence slogans at high\u2011profile matches while not sanctioning a PSG banner calling for a stop to Gaza genocide.",
