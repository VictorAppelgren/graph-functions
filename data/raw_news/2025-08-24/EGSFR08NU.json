  "title": "Hospitality suffers half of all job losses since Reeves\u2019s Budget",
  "description": "Britain\u2019s pub and restaurants have suffered more than half of all jobs losses in Britain since Rachel Reeves\u2019s \u00a325bn Budget tax raid, the industry has warned.",
  "content": "Britain\u2019s pub and restaurants have suffered more than half of all jobs losses in Britain since Rachel Reeves\u2019s \u00a325bn Budget tax raid, the industry has warned.\n\nAlmost 90,000 jobs have been lost in the hospitality sector since the Chancellor\u2019s increase to employer taxes last October, equal to 53pc of the 165,000 roles which have gone across all industries, according to trade group UKHospitality.\n\nIt means one in every 25 jobs in pubs, bars, hotels, cafes and restaurants have been lost, leaving customers with fewer serving staff and putting increased pressure on existing workers during busy periods.\n\nUKHospitality said the figures indicated the blow from the tax increase was far worse than the 50,000 job losses forecasted by the Office for Budget Responsibility.\n\nHospitality is particularly vulnerable to Ms Reeves\u2019s changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) because the increase in the tax rate from 13.8pc to 15pc was accompanied by a cut to the annual earnings threshold at which it applies.\n\nBy cutting the point at which the levy kicks in from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000, the Chancellor applied the tax to more of the low-paid and part-time staff on which bars and eateries depend.\n\nThe prospects for the industry are worsening because of the higher costs of keeping more staff on the payroll.\n\nThere were 73,000 job vacancies in accommodation and food services in the three months to July, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThat is down by one fifth from before the Budget, and is the fewest since the Covid lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, when much of the industry was forced to close its doors.\n\nExcluding the pandemic, it represents the fewest vacancies since 2014, when the economy was still recovering from the long hangover of the financial crisis.\n\nKate Nicholls, chairman of UKHospitality, said the figures underlined the scale of the harm caused by the record tax rises imposed by Labour in its first year of government.\n\n\u201cThe number of job losses suffered in hospitality since the Budget is staggering,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMore than half of all job losses since October occurring in hospitality is further evidence that our sector has been by far the hardest hit by the Government\u2019s regressive tax increases.\u201d\n\nShe said companies are cutting back on staff, as well as on opening hours and investment. \u201cThe sheer scale of costs being placed upon hospitality has forced businesses to take agonisingly tough decisions to cut jobs \u2013 with part-time and flexible roles often those most at risk,\u201d she added\n\nAs a result, UKHospitality has called on the Chancellor to reverse the \u201cdevastating\u201d raids to try to revive the economy. The trade group wants lower business rates, a change to NICs and cuts to VAT paid on food and drink.",
