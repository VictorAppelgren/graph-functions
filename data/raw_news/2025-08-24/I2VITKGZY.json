  "content": "Tens of thousands of residents were being evacuated from coastal Vietnam on Monday, as Typhoon Kajiki barrelled towards landfall expected to lash the country's central belt with gales of around 160 kmh.\n\nThe typhoon -- the fifth to affect Vietnam this year -- is currently at sea, roiling the Gulf of Tonkin with waves of up to 9.5 metres (31 feet).\n\nMore than 325,500 residents in five coastal provinces have been slated for evacuation to schools and public buildings converted into temporary shelters, authorities said.\n\nThe waterfront city of Vinh was deluged overnight, its streets largely deserted by morning with most shops and restaurants closed as residents and business-owners sandbagged their property entrances.\n\nBy dawn nearly 30,000 people had been evacuated from the region, two domestic airports were shut and all fishing ships in the typhoon's path called back to harbour.\n\nIt is expected to make landfall around 1:00 pm (0600 GMT) with winds of 157 kilometres per hour (98 miles per hour), Vietnam's National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said.\n\nHowever, its power is due to dramatically dissipate thereafter.\n\nThe Joint Typhoon Warning Center said conditions suggested \"an approaching weakening trend as the system approaches the continental shelf of the Gulf of Tonkin where there is less ocean heat content\".\n\nOver a dozen domestic Vietnamese flights were cancelled on Sunday, while China's tropical resort of Hainan evacuated around 20,000 residents as the typhoon passed its south.\n\nIn Vietnam, more than 100 people have been killed or left missing from natural disasters in the first seven months of 2025, according to the agriculture ministry.\n\nEconomic losses have been estimated at more than $21 million.\n\nVietnam suffered $3.3 billion in economic losses last September as a result of Typhoon Yagi, which swept across the country's north and caused hundreds of fatalities.\n\nScientists say human-caused climate change is driving more intense and unpredictable weather patterns that can make destructive floods and storms more likely, particularly in the tropics.",

  "summary": "Tens of thousands of residents are being evacuated from coastal Vietnam as Typhoon Kajiki approaches its landfall, expected to hit the central belt with winds of around 160 kmh. Over 325,500 residents in five coastal provinces have been scheduled for evacuation. The typhoon, the fifth to affect Vietnam this year, is currently at sea in the Gulf of Tonkin with waves of up to 9.5 metres (31 feet). However, its power is expected to significantly weaken once it reaches the continental shelf. The evacuation of the waterfront city of Vinh was largely complete, with nearly 30,000 people evacuated and two domestic airports shut. Over a dozen domestic Vietnamese flights were cancelled on Sunday, while China's tropical resort of Hainan evacuated around 20,000 residents.",

The storm, already producing 9.5\u2011metre waves in the Gulf of Tonkin, was expected to make landfall around 1\u202fpm local time but was predicted to weaken as it approached the continental shelf. While the typhoon caused more than $21\u202fmillion in economic losses, it added to a year in which over 100 people have died or gone missing from natural disasters, underscoring the growing impact of climate\u2011driven extreme weather in the tropics.",
