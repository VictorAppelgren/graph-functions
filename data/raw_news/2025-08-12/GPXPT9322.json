  "description": "D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith faces social media mockery after appearing confused by reporter's question about chain of command following Trump's federalization of department.",
  "content": "Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith is facing backlash and mockery on social media after she appeared to not understand a question from the media about the department's \"chain of command\" amid President Donald Trump's recent federalization of the department.\n\n\"Can you tell us what the chain of command is now?\" a reporter was heard asking Smith during a press conference Tuesday morning.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" the police chief responded.\n\n\"Well, is it Pam Bondi speaking to the mayor? Is it you? How does this work?\" the reporter continued, before Bowser stepped in to explain the department's chain of command following Trump invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act Monday, which allows the president to assume emergency control of the capital's police force.\n\nFBI DIRECTOR KASH PATEL BACKS TRUMP'S DC POLICE TAKEOVER: 'WHEN YOU LET GOOD COPS BE COPS, THEY DELIVER'\n\nThe exchange came amid Bowser's brief press conference Tuesday morning following her meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n\"Our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, none of that has changed,\" Bowser explained, adding that Bondi is working as Trump's \"proxy\" under the federalization order and that the pair are in close communication.\n\nTOP HOUSE REPUBLICAN SAYS TRUMP 'RIGHTLY' TOOK OVER DC POLICE, DEMANDS BOWSER, OTHERS TESTIFY ON CRIME\n\n\"We have more police, and we want to make sure we use them,\" she added.\n\nThe exchange of Smith appearing to not understand the reporter's question on the department's \"chain of command\" sparked mockery and backlash online Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"This is who is in charge of the police in D.C...\" popular conservative X account Libs of TikTok posted of the exchange.\n\n\"This is why DEI is a disease,\" National Co-Chair of the RNC Youth Advisory Council CJ Pearson posted to X in response to the exchange.\n\nSmith previously served as the department's first chief equity officer, where she \"led the department's efforts on diversity, equity and inclusion,\" according to her biography.\n\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\n\n\"WTF! The DC Police Chief doesn\u2019t even know what Chain of Command means,\" another conservative X account posted in response.\n\n\"Smith previously served as the Police Department's \"Chief Equity Officer,'\" the Trump War Room account posted to X.\n\n\"MIND BLOWING: D.C. police chief reveals she DOES NOT KNOW what chain of command is. Folks, this is the Washington, D.C. POLICE Chief,\" another critic posted.\n\n\"NEW: Washington DC Police Chief Pamela A. Smith doesn't know what the \u2018chain of command\u2019 means. \u2026 Yikes,\" Trending Politics co-owner Collin Rugg posted.\n\nFox Digital reached out to the Metropolitan Police Department and Bowser's office for comment on the exchange and subsequent backlash, but did not immediately receive replies.\n\nTRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\n\nTrump federalized the D.C. police department following a spate of high-profile attacks and killings in the city in recent weeks, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern in June, the fatal shooting of a pair of Israeli embassy staffers in May, and a brutal attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer earlier in August.\n\n\"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,\" he said. \"And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump declared it was \"Liberation Day in D.C.,\" adding, \"We're going to take our capital back.\"\n\n\"We're taking it back under the authority vested in me as the president of the United States. I'm officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. You know what that is. And placing the under direct federal control. \u2026 In addition, I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, D.C. And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" he said Monday.",

Violent crime is down 26% this year, compared to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nFox News Digital reached out to Bowser, Mendelson and Schwalb for comment.\nHours earlier, Trump declared a public safety emergency in the District and invoked a portion of the D.C. Home Rule Act \u2013 which granted Washington, D.C., more independence from Congress \u2013 allowing him to seize control of the local police for up to 48 hours.\n\"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of violent youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore,\" Trump said during a press conference at the White House.\nTRUMP TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE ON DC CRIME AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS HIT STREETS\nHowever, in order to go beyond the 48-hour mark, the president needs approval from the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \u2014 the two panels that have oversight of Washington, D.C.\nTrump can take over the district\u2019s police force for up to 30 days if he sends a special notice to the panels, but beyond that would require a joint resolution from the House and Senate extending the takeover.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA spokesperson for the Oversight Committee told Fox News Digital that the White House notified the panel of its intent to go beyond the 48-hour window.\nFox News Digital reached out to the Senate Homeland Security Committee for comment but did not immediately hear back."

      "text": "President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is activating approximately 800 National Guard troops and is taking over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington, after beefing up federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital Saturday.\n\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC,\" Trump told reporters at a Monday press conference. \"And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.\"\nTrump also said that he would federalize the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to respond to crime, placing it under the authority of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nNational Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and are typically overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from California to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to dispatch the troops.\nThe federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard.\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will operationalize the D.C. National Guard, and signaled that more National Guard troops could be roped into the deployment down the line.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week,\" Hegseth told reporters Monday. \"At your direction as well, sir, there are other units we are prepared to bring in. Other National Guard units, other specialized units. They will be strong, they will be tough, and they will stand with their law enforcement partners.\"\nTrump\u2019s remarks come just after he promised Washington would be \"LIBERATED\" from \"Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum\" in a post on Truth Social Monday morning. He said in the post that the \"days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER!\"\nTrump floated the idea of taking over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department and utilizing National Guard troops to manage crime in Washington Wednesday, following the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer on Aug. 3 in Washington\u2019s Logan Circle.\nTRUMP THREATENS TO FEDERALIZE DC AFTER EX-DOGE EMPLOYEE 'BIG BALLS' VIOLENTLY BEATEN\n\"What a shame \u2013 rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else, we\u2019re not going to let it, and that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly, too,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday at the White House.\nTrump also told reporters at the time he was open to taking over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department because crime in the nation\u2019s capital is \"ridiculous.\"\nWhile a temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is justified in cases of emergency, Trump's move will likely be challenged in court over whether the situation in Washington qualifies as an emergency.\nTrump has historically railed against violence in Washington, and said Tuesday that crime is \"totally out of control\" in the nation's capital.\nMeanwhile, crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nWATCH: TRUMP HINTS HE WILL FEDERALIZE DC SOON, BRING IN NATIONAL GUARD AFTER \u2018BIG BALLS\u2019 ATTACK\nWashington\u2019s Mayor Muriel Bowser challenged Trump\u2019s description of the city during an interview with MSNBC Sunday, and voiced concerns about the possibility of activating the National Guard to tackle the city\u2019s crime.\n\"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,\" Bowser said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently, and I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\" Bowser said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated."

      "text": "FBI Director Kash Patel endorsed President Donald Trump's plans to take over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington D.C., amid heavy criticism from Democrats and local officials who say the move is part of a power grab.\nPatel was seen Monday afternoon inside a command post for the first night of the temporary takeover in a show of support for law enforcement.\n\"Proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the men and women who keep our nation\u2019s capital safe,\" Patel said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital. \"When you let good cops be cops, give them the tools they need, and back them every step of the way, they deliver - every time.\"\nIn photos exclusively provided to Fox News Digital, Patel can be seen speaking Monday to FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel wearing protective vests at a command center at a U.S. Park Police station.\nOn Monday, Trump said he would federalize the police department and place it under the authority of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an effort to address crime. He also said he was activating approximately 800 National Guard troops to \"reestablish law, order and public safety\" in the capital.\nWashington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move \"unsettling and unprecedented.\"\n\"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\" Bowser said during a news conference. \"I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\nThe District of Columbia Home Rule Act allows Trump to place the city's police department under federal control for up to 30 days. Bowser noted that granting D.C. statehood, an issue local officials have repeatedly advocated for, could have prevented the takeover.\n\"If people are concerned about the president being able to move the National Guard into our city, the time to do that would have been when the Congress had a bill that it could have given control of the D.C. National Guard to D.C.,\" she said. \"So there are things that, when a city is not a state, and not fully autonomous, and doesn\u2019t have senators, that the federal government can do.\"\nOther Democrats heavily criticized the Trump administration for the move.\n\"If President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our work to drive down crime and violence,\" the office of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said. \"Sending in the national guard would only serve to destabilize our city and undermine our public safety efforts.\"\nThe Washington, D.C. City Council called the temporary takeover a \"manufactured intrusion on local authority.\"\nTRUMP CLAIMS DC CRIMES TROUNCE STATS FROM NOTORIOUSLY VIOLENT CITIES WORLDWIDE\n\"Violent crime in the District is at the lowest rates we\u2019ve seen in 30 years. Federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency,\" the council said in a joint statement. \"Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard\u2019s role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission.\"\nThe National Capital Region Delegation, a body comprised of several House Democratic lawmakers, accused Trump of personally inciting crime in the capital, referring to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol building.\n\"Trump\u2019s \u2018temporary\u2019 takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is not intended to prevent crime, it is a soft launch of authoritarianism,\" the group said in a statement. \"Trump has a longstanding pattern of seeking showy displays of power. As he has shown repeatedly, Trump is working to serve himself and is not concerned with keeping American families safe in cities and towns across our country.\"\n\"The President\u2019s announcement this morning is an unserious and unacceptable publicity stunt,\" they added. \"If he wants to reduce crime in the District of Columbia, he should focus on getting his Republican allies in Congress to restore the funding they arbitrarily stripped out of the city\u2019s budget, which risks cuts to law enforcement and other public safety measures.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, called Trump's announcement a \"gross overreach, disconnected from actual conditions on the ground.\"\n\"So, we have to ask: Will the president\u2019s heavy-handed show of force make the average D.C. resident feel safer? Will it create jobs for working people and bring patrons back to downtown businesses?\" she said. \"Will it provide young people a pathway to jobs, skills or other activities that keep them off the streets?\"\n\"The answer to those questions is \u2018no,\u2019 she added. \"That\u2019s why this move is yet another crass spectacle from a president who cares more about targeting, intimidating and playing king than the safety of D.C. and its residents.\"\nTrump's opponents have cited crime statistics showing crime in Washington is on the decline. Crime in Washington is down 26% this year compared to the same timeframe in 2024, according to the MPD. Assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%, according to police data. In January, the Justice Department said violent crime in 2024 in the district was down 35% from 2023, the lowest it has been in over 30 years.\nHowever, Trump disagrees.\nMetropolitan Police Department data shows that while the homicide rate is falling, the last five years saw the greatest number of murders since 2008.\n\"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,\" Trump said Monday. \"This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse.\"\nFox News Digital's Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report."

      "text": "President Donald Trump shared new details on Monday about his plan to take control of public safety in Washington, D.C., following a brutal attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, but D.C. residents aren't convinced.\nTrump announced on Monday that he is activating the District of Columbia National Guard and seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department after floating the idea since last week's assault in Washington\u2019s Logan Circle.\nSome Washington residents who spoke to Fox News Digital called it a \"terrible idea\" that \"doesn't make a lot of sense.\"\n\"I think D.C. politics should stay with D.C., and, unfortunately, the federal government is apparently overstepping their bounds right now, so I hope that D.C. is allowed to govern itself, as well as police itself,\" one Washington resident told Fox News Digital ahead of Trump's announcement.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nTrump controversially federalized the California National Guard amid anti-ICE protests that delved into riots in Los Angeles in June. Protesters were rejecting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations and Trump's robust immigration crackdown.\nThe president bypassed Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy National Guard troops to support ICE deportation. It was the first time a president federalized the National Guard without the governor's request in more than 60 years.\nNow, the tension between local and federal powers is unfolding in the nation's capital. But just like in California, many Washington residents have concerns about seeing \"troops on our streets.\"\n\"We have laws for a reason,\" one resident told Fox News Digital.\n\"Privatizing security is a terrible idea, and I think anything that Trump does is garbage,\" another Washington resident added.\nDespite their apprehension about National Guard troops patrolling the nation's capital, many residents said something needs to be done to address crime in Washington, D.C.\nWhile the Department of Justice indicated a 30-year low in violent crime last year, concerns about the city's safety linger, with one resident telling Fox News Digital, \"The city is getting dangerous.\"\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" one resident said of Trump's new plan. \"It's something that needs to be done for the city to be safe. Right now, we're not safe. The kids and the teenagers are doing everything. So yeah, I think that's a great idea.\"\nAnd another Washington resident said, \"We need all the protection that we can get in the city, because the city is really getting dangerous,\" telling Fox News Digital that she has to \"make sure to come home before sundown\" and she is afraid of getting robbed when she gets off public transportation.\n\"Things do seem out of control and desperate, but I don't know what kind of numbers to take, what numbers to read. One minute they'll say crime is out of control. Next minute, they will say crime is down a certain percentage. It's kind of confusing, and I don't know who to believe in and which way to go, to be honest,\" a Washington resident said, articulating the dichotomy between the low crime statistics and the alarming crime stories.\nBut another D.C. resident said, \"There's no way he should be in control of anything,\" and Washington, D.C., \"should be a state,\" so the district has more power to make decisions for itself.\n\"I don't think it's necessary,\" another Washington resident added. \"I do think there needs to be some change within [the] Metropolitan [Police Department] because safety is an issue.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe added: \"It needs to be localized.\"\nFox News Digital's Diana Stacy contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "Washington, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith faced criticism after appearing confused about the department's chain of command during a press conference, coinciding with President Trump's announcement to federalize the D.C. police and deploy National Guard troops to combat crime. The move has sparked backlash from local officials and residents, with many expressing concerns about federal overreach and the necessity of such actions, despite crime statistics indicating a decline in violent crime in the city. Critics argue that Trump's intervention is unwarranted and a display of authoritarianism, while supporters claim it is a necessary step to restore order.",
