  "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few Koreans would turn down freshwater eel: Deboned, dipped in flour and deep fried, it is a special treat. Lee Ae-ran, however, won\u2019t touch the dish. \u201cWhen I see it, my heart grows heavy,\u201d she says.\n\nIt reminds her too much of the fateful autumn evening in 1974, when a loud rap on her family\u2019s apartment door in Pyongyang, North Korea, came as they sat down to a dinner of eel. It was an officer of the feared State Security Bureau.\n\nHe gruffly told the family that Ms. Lee\u2019s father, a bureaucrat, was needed for a \u201cgreat socialist construction project\u201d in remote, rugged Ryanggang Province in the north. Several men barged in and began roughly packing the family\u2019s possessions.\n\nOnly later would Ms. Lee learn what had happened.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early \u201870s, authorities began investigating people whose documents had been lost amid the 1950-53 Korean War. They discovered that Ms. Lee\u2019s paternal grandparents had escaped to the South.\n\nThat thrust the Lees out of the comfortable \u201cloyal\u201d class and into the despised \u201chostile\u201d class.\n\nBanished from the relative comforts of Pyongyang into rural exile in an austere mountain hamlet, the Lees would suffer the murderous famines of the 1990s \u2013 euphemistically known in today\u2019s North Korea as \u201cThe Arduous March.\u201d\n\nShe remembers washing mold off rice crackers, meals of potato skin scraps, rice soaked in kerosene and bean stalks \u201cthat even cattle would not eat.\u201d\n\nToday, Ms. Lee runs a restaurant on a quiet hillside perched just minutes from Seoul\u2019s downtown, and in May published her memoir, \u201cOne Meal, One Memory: The Taste of Survival in North Korean Cuisine.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Lee, culinary phrasing takes on new meanings. Complaints lead to people disappearing, \u201clike evaporating steam.\u201d\n\nBeyond food, she recalls conditions inside the world\u2019s most insulated state.\n\nPersons with \u201cgreasy hands\u201d \u2013 party elite \u2013 abused their privileges, from demanding bribes to sexually assaulting individuals. Victims who resisted suffered crippling imprisonment \u2014 some were forced to kneel in cells, year after year \u2014 under false pretenses.\n\nAn \u201cAssault Corps\u201d was not a military unit, but a forced labor mobilization. Tasks were battles: \u201cbracken battles\u201d to gather ferns; \u201cproduction battles\u201d to build a rail line.\n\nChildhood was no defense against the state.\n\nLessons were canceled and school children were driven into mountains to gather ingredients for bibimbap on overgrown trails infested with snakes.\n\nA group of runaways, imprisoned in a crowded, underground cell, were thrashed with leather belts until their skin split. Only bribes from family members could secure release.\n\nMs. Lee was humiliated in front of her class by her teacher when she expressed hopes of attending college. She was told her parents\u2019 \u201clowly life\u201d made her ineligible \u2013 a realization that drove her to attempt suicide.\n\nTobacco resin and match heads were applied to disinfect wounds. Poppy seeds boiled in water became opiate anesthetics. Raw starch was used to stem diarrhea.\n\nRural banishment was tough enough. The situation became dramatically worse in the 1990s.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union imploded, North Korea lost privileged trade and suffered failed harvests and floods. Resultant famines may have killed more than 10% of the populace.\n\nFeral orphans massed outside rail stations. She watched a group fighting over a boiled rat \u2013 valuable nutrition \u2014 and observed people trying to feed a starving boy. He died in front of her.\n\nShe was offered an 18-month-old baby by a desperate old woman, and she witnessed a malnourished family eating fruit rinds thrown into the Yalu River. She learned the bodies of the starved were trucked out of towns and dumped, without funerals, in the mountains.\n\nShe relates the story of a starving, hallucinating man who murdered, butchered and stewed his 9-year-old son, thinking he was a piglet.\n\nThese horrors, Ms. Lee recalls, took place as dictator Kim Jong Il was constructing a massive, ornate mausoleum for his deceased father, Kim Il Sung, while TV broadcasts hailed a \u201csocialist paradise.\u201d\n\nAs black markets, selling goods ranging from smuggled Chinese food to firewood, took over from the collapsed state distribution system, a new phrase was intoned: \u201cTo preserve socialism, we must practice capitalism.\u201d\n\nStreet snacks that conveniently combined protein and carbohydrates \u2013 chunks of fried tofu, stuffed with rice \u2013 were invented.\n\nEven in showpiece capital Pyongyang, apartment elevators and plumbing failed. Unwilling to use basement toilets, exhausted residents of upper floors defecated into paper and dropped the waste off balconies onto streets.\n\nMs. Lee recalls a 19-year-old who did not know what an egg was and laments that famine wiped classic dishes off menus.\n\n\u201cIn the past, beef dishes like bulgogi were really famous in the North,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, most people have not even smelled it.\u201d\n\nShe defected to the South in 1997.\n\nThere, she was stunned by the amounts of food served and by the culinary diversity. In Pyongyang, the only non-native eateries were Chinese, as well as one Russian and one \u201cWestern\u201d restaurant.\n\nIn Seoul, she could not eat her first steak. \u201cIt was rare and bloody, and I was not used to beef,\u201d she recalls.\n\nShe leveraged past experiences \u2013 her mother had been a chef in Pyongyang, and in her \u201cAssault Corps,\u201d she had cooked for the laborers \u2013 to open her restaurant \u201cNong Rae Bab Sang,\u201d named after a willowed island in Pyongyang\u2019s Daedong River.\n\nDiners have included former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and ex-U.K. Premier Theresa May.\n\nHer book published this year aimed, from the outset, to differ from other defector accounts.\n\n\u201cThey write about political prisons and defections, which is hard for ordinary South Koreans to accept,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought food was a more natural way to talk about human rights.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her culinary career, her activities have included being the first defector to run for political office \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 and berating North Korean cheerleaders who attended the 2018 Pyongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea. (They ignored her.)\n\nIt is widely believed that North Korean food security has improved since the 1990s. The United Nations estimates that 10.7 million of North Korea\u2019s 25.9 million people are malnourished, and 18% of children are stunted \u2014 but it does not mention starvation.\n\nAnd, as of this year, Moscow has been exporting food to Pyongyang.\n\nMs. Lee, the first North Korean female to earn a doctorate from a South Korean University \u2013 in food and nutrition at Ewha Womans University \u2014 is unconvinced.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the food resources to improve,\u201d she said, referring to North Korea\u2019s geographical unsuitability for agriculture.",
