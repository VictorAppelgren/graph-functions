  "content": "As it was fully expected, Kiev regime leader Volodymyr Zelensky is becoming a major obstacle in the peace process between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nEven though Gallup poll shows 70% of Ukrainians want negotiations to end the ear, he is still dragging his feet and demanding what he can\u2019t have.\n\nThe MSM darling has splashed his stance on endless newspaper articles, as in the non-exhaustive list from the last week alone:\n\nThe Washington Post: \u201cUkraine will reject any proposal that involves ceding territory to Russia, Zelensky says\u201d; BBC News: \u201cVolodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine will not give up land as Donald Trump suggests idea ahead of meeting Vladimir Putin in Alaska\u201d; Reuters: \u201c\u2018Ukrainians will not give their land to occupiers,\u2019 President Zelenskiy said\u201d; The Straits Times: \u201cZelensky says Ukraine will not cede land to Russia for peace\u201d; Bloomberg: \u201cZelenskiy Rejects Ceding Land as Key Security Officials Meet\u201d.\n\nThis has made US president Donald J. Trump publicly criticize Zelensky for his lack of progress in peace building.\n\nWatch: \u2018He\u2019s gone to a lot of meetings\u2026he\u2019s been there for three and a half years and NOTHING happened\u2019\n\nWatch: \u2018[Zelensky] got approval to go into war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap\u2019.\n\nZelensky has rallied the Euro-Globalists, and so you have France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Germany\u2019s Friedrich Merz, Poland\u2019s Donald Tusk, as well as EU unelected bureaucrats \u2013 all publicly debating and rejecting a plan that hasn\u2019t even been formed and negotiated \u2013 much less divulged.\n\nBut Trump is laser-focused on peace and prosperity.",
