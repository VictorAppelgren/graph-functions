      "title": "Circle plans $1.3B stock sale, four times IPO price",
      "summary": "Circle Internet Group plans a $1.3 billion secondary stock sale at $130 per share, quadrupling its June IPO price, with the company selling 2 million shares and existing shareholders offering 8 million, using proceeds for general corporate purposes. Q2 2025 earnings show a 90% jump in USDC circulation to $65.2 billion, revenue of $658 million, adjusted EBITDA of $126 million, and a $482 million net loss largely driven by IPO-related non‑cash charges. The firm has launched its Arc Layer‑1 blockchain, expanded payments and capital‑market use cases, and highlighted strong adoption and partnerships with firms such as Binance and OKX. Meanwhile, the newly passed GENIUS Act establishes a federal framework for stablecoin issuance, reinforcing Circle’s position as a regulated issuer amid ongoing market volatility.",
