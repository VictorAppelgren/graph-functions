  "title": "Russia is 'teetering on the brink of a recession' and headed for a disastrous harvest, while Putin's other top source of cash plunges",
  "description": "\"We also think there's a significant probability of Russia's economy slipping into a technical recession in the coming quarters.\"",
  "content": "Russia could slip into a recession soon and is having its worst harvest in 17 years, further straining an economy that\u2019s already seen energy revenue plunge.\n\nFor now, Vladimir Putin has staved off additional U.S. sanctions, as he bought more time to prosecute his war on Ukraine by meeting with President Donald Trump in Alaska last week, sparking a flurry of diplomatic activity as European allies try to forge security guarantees for Kyiv.\n\nBut time may not be Russia\u2019s ally.\n\nWhile Trump didn\u2019t follow through on his threats to penalize Moscow for failing to reach a ceasefire agreement, there\u2019s also been no sign of talks to remove existing sanctions and revive economic cooperation.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s too early to adopt a more optimistic view on the Russian economy, which we think is teetering on the brink of a recession,\u201d Tatiana Orlova, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note on Monday.\n\nSince the Alaska meeting produced nothing that would move the needle, she reaffirmed her forecast for Russian GDP growth to slow sharply this year to just 1.2% from 4.3% in 2024.\n\nAnd after that, the economy will stagnate even further, coming to a near standstill with growth dropping below 1% in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\u201cWe also think there\u2019s a significant probability of Russia\u2019s economy slipping into a technical recession in the coming quarters,\u201d Orlova added.\n\nSimilar alarms have been piling up this year. In June, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov warned that Russia was \u201con the brink\u201d of a recession. Russian banks have also raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers\u2019 ability to service loans.\n\nLast month, the central bank slashed interest rates by 200 basis points to revive stalling growth, after hiking them to sky-high levels to fight inflation that\u2019s been stoked by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia is having a disastrous harvest despite being an agricultural powerhouse, putting further pressure on the economy and the Kremlin\u2019s finances.\n\nThe country\u2019s grain and fertilizer exports haven\u2019t been sanctioned due to concerns about food shortages and have been a source of economic strength for Russia.\n\nBut July saw the lowest grain exports for that month since 2008, according to Peter Frankopan, associate fellow on Russia and Eurasia at International Institute for Strategic Studies, who attributed it to intensifying climate volatility.\n\nThis year, crops have been damaged by unseasonable frost in the spring as well as record heat and drought conditions in the summer, he explained in a recent post. Total grain production is now expected to fall to 130 million metric tons, down 18% from a 2022 peak.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s bad 2025 harvest is more than a weather event: it reveals the structural fragility of Russia\u2019s war economy and the growing risks to a system built on fiscal buffers and fossil fuels,\u201d Frankopan wrote.\n\nIn fact, Russia\u2019s fiscal buffer is disappearing as cash from energy dwindles. The Kremlin\u2019s oil and gas revenue, which is its main source of funds, tumbled 27% in July from a year ago to 787.3 billion rubles, or about $9.8 billion.\n\nAs war spending soars, the result has been widening budget deficits. Russia has had to tap reserves in its National Wealth Fund, which has shrunk from $135 billion in January 2022 to just $35 billion this past May.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s economy is fast approaching a fiscal crunch that will encumber its war effort,\u201d economist and Russia expert Anders \u00c5slund wrote in a Project Syndicate op-ed earlier this month. \u201cThough that may not be enough to compel Putin to seek peace, it does suggest that the walls are closing in on him.\u201d",

      "text": "- After years of anticipated economic strife, Russian authorities warn the country is on the precipice of a recession as the Kremlin\u2019s bloated military spending amid its ongoing invasion of Ukraine exacerbates underlying labor shortages and rising inflation.\nRussia\u2019s wartime economy, once defiant in the face of Western sanctions and geopolitical isolation, is showing signs of fatigue. On Thursday, Russia\u2019s economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov warned the country was \u201con the brink\u201d of a recession at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.\nReshetnikov\u2019s declaration confirmed what several economists foresaw earlier this year: Russia\u2019s high-spending war economy, after years of defying predictions of imminent recession, is finally running into the hard limits of labor, productivity, and inflation.\nRussia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine prompted a slew of sanctions by Western nations, and the near-total departure of Western companies from the nation. But despite predictions of its imminent demise, the country\u2019s economy has held up fairly well by pursuing what economists call \u201cmilitary Keynesianism,\u201d fueling growth through massive defense-related fiscal spending. By pouring a record number of resources into the military-industrial complex, which reached a value of $167 billion last year, the Kremlin spiked industrial production, drove two consecutive years of GDP growth, and lifted wages across war-related sectors.\nFor decades, the Kremlin has allowed Russia\u2019s defense budget to grow faster than the country\u2019s GDP, but the budget expenditures have increased enormously since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In 2021, the country spent 3.6% of its GDP on national defense, according to the World Bank. Now, 6.3% of the GDP goes to defense spending, nearly double the share in the United States.\nRussia\u2019s military spending bubble has created what Elina Ribakova, economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics describes as a game of musical chairs.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s making money. Suddenly, people are enjoying higher incomes, and can get a mortgage, or buy durables. It makes this war popular in a practical, morbid way. You want the music going,\u201d she explains.\nBut, as Nicholas Fenton, associate director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies warns, \u201cYou can only kind of spend so much before you hit structural limits in the economy. And the big hang up for the Russian economy throughout this period has been the country\u2019s chronic labor shortage.\u201d\nPrior to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the country reported 4.75% unemployment in 2021, with levels hitting a record 2.4% low in early 2025, according to state-reported data. But as unemployment has declined, the country has also witnessed a mass exodus of as many as one million residents, and has suffered significant military deaths in the hundreds of thousands. These figures have exacerbated a pre-existing worker deficit in Russia due to a declining working-age population. In 2022 alone, the number of workers aged 16 to 35 fell by 1.33 million, and their share of the labor force was the lowest on record since 1996.\nThese preexisting shortages in the labor market have compounded as citizens were drafted, emigrated, or flocked to defense-related jobs with lucrative bonuses. Although real wages increased, productivity didn\u2019t, fueling inflation and the threat of stagflation outside of the military, and stifling investments in non-defense sectors.\nThis spring, Russia\u2019s manufacturing sector, an industry that also includes defense enterprises, suffered its steepest downturn in close to three years, dropping 2 points from February to March. Similarly, Russia\u2019s industrial production growth hit a two-year low, increasing only 0.2% year-on-year.\nAll the while prices have continued to increase, growing by 9.52% last year compared to 7.42% in 2023. Currently, inflation in Russia sits at nearly 10% and the central bank\u2019s hawkish stance has interest rates up to 20% in June. Meanwhile, the central bank\u2019s growth forecast is between 1 and 2% for 2025.\nInterest rates may be shifting, however: senior officials and Russian businessmen have repeatedly called for cuts to promote growth, and President Vladimir Putin has urged policymakers to strike a balance between fighting inflation and boosting growth.\nUltimately, for the country\u2019s growth potential to change, the country would need to improve labor productivity, a difficult feat amid persisting sanctions and significant inflation, according to Alexander Kolyandr, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.\nOn a per-capita basis, the nation\u2019s GDP lags far behind peers, closer to that of Mexico or Turkey than Western Europe. And unlike Germany or Japan, Russia\u2019s growth is heavily dependent on volatile commodity exports, such as oil, and state-driven demand.\nOil and gas revenues which account for around 20% of the country\u2019s GDP, underscoring the precarious nature of its fiscal health. In the first half of 2025, falling oil exports and a dip in global prices forced the Kremlin to revise its budget deficit. But the growing conflict between Israel and Iran has already pushed oil prices higher, offering Russia potential temporary budgetary relief.\n\u201cThe war in the Middle East is actually pretty good for Putin, but that wouldn\u2019t save the economy. It just means that the government may continue to maintain this policy of managed decline,\u201d Kolyandr tells Fortune.\nRibakova agrees with Kolyandr. \u201cWe were sort of rubbing our hands as oil was going down because that\u2019s the most effective sanction against Russia. And of course, now we\u2019ve seen the prices pick up,\u201d she says.\nRussia\u2019s oil exports, however, don\u2019t provide a solution to the lack of foreign investments in the country and the total retreat of American companies. Even with President Donald Trump\u2019s hands-off approach to diplomacy with the Kremlin, Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees the return of U.S. businesses to Russia as a key bargaining chip.\n\u201cTrump is saying to Vladimir Putin, \u2018if you\u2019re ready to make a deal and end this war and agree to a ceasefire in place, I can envisage a return of American companies to Russia. I can envisage the rehabilitation of Vladimir Putin,\u2019\u201d he says."

Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s economy continues to feel the strain of Western sanctions and high interest rates. The Kremlin also faces a \u201cfiscal crunch\u201d that will hamper its war effort, an expert said.\nRussia\u2019s economy has been surprisingly resilient in the face of Western sanctions that were triggered by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nBut as Putin gets set to meet President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday to discuss ending the war, there are more signs of strain in the Russian economy and fiscal situation.\nIn June, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov warned that Russia was \u201con the brink\u201d of a recession. And last month, the central bank slashed interest rates by 200 basis points to revive stalling growth.\nMeanwhile, government finances have been under growing pressure, too. The Kremlin\u2019s oil and gas revenue, which is its main source of funds, tumbled 27% in July from a year ago to 787.3 billion rubles, or about $9.8 billion.\nThat\u2019s as crude oil prices have fallen, while Europe has continued to add sanctions on Moscow and crack down on the \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of tankers delivering Russian crude supplies.\nEven as revenue weakens, spending keeps soaring amid Russia\u2019s relentless attacks on Ukraine. In addition to outlays for weapons, incentives to mobilize more volunteers for the army as well as compensation for families of dead soldiers remain sky-high.\nThe result has been widening deficits, with the gap for the first seven months of the year reaching $61.44 billion, or 2.2% of GDP, up from 1.7% during the first six months of the year.\nSpending from January to July shot up 20.8% compared with the same period a year ago, while revenue increased just 2.8% during that span.\nEconomist and author Anders \u00c5slund, who wrote Russia\u2019s Crony Capitalism: The Path From Market Economy to Kleptocracy, said the situation is dire enough that Russia may run out of financial reserves, forcing cuts to public expenditures.\nIn a Project Syndicate op-ed on Thursday, he pointed out that Moscow has few sources of funding as sanctions have largely shut out Russia from the global financial system\u2014and even banks from ally China are reluctant to lend money.\nSo Russia has had to tap reserves in its National Wealth Fund, which has dwindled from $135 billion in January 2022 to just $35 billion this past May, according to \u00c5slund, who predicted that the fund is set to run out in the second half of this year.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s economy is fast approaching a fiscal crunch that will encumber its war effort,\u201d he added. \u201cThough that may not be enough to compel Putin to seek peace, it does suggest that the walls are closing in on him.\u201d\nFor now, Moscow has avoided steeper penalties from the U.S. as Trump backed off from this threat to impose secondary sanctions that would hit buyers of Russian oil, choosing instead to try reviving ceasefire talks in Alaska.\nAn earlier round of negotiations in April to stop the fighting included a proposal from Trump\u2019s envoy to lift U.S. economic sanctions on Russia, require neutrality for Ukraine, and recognize territory Russia seized. Ukrainian and European officials rejected those terms, and talks failed to produce a deal.\nOn Friday, Trump predicted some land would have to change hands to reach an agreement this time.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at territory that\u2019s been fought over for three and a half years with\u2014you know, a lot of Russians have died, a lot of Ukrainians have died,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.\u201d"
