  "title": "How to block spam calls on iPhone",
  "description": "Say goodbye to annoying and interrupting spammers",
  "content": "I don\u2019t know about you, but I receive multiple spam calls every single week. As well as being an interruption and an annoyance, they can also be potentially dangerous. And with an increasing number of scammers trying their luck, it's important to know how to put a stop to these unwanted calls.\n\nThe simplest option on iPhone is to manually block individual numbers. However, spammers use a range of phone numbers, and blocking specific people can be time-consuming and tedious. That's why, in this guide, we recommend two alternative ways that block all spam callers from even getting through to your phone.\n\nLuckily, Apple acknowledges this problem and is set to introduce a dedicated Call Screening feature in iOS 26. But until then \u2013 or if your iPhone won't support iOS 26 \u2013 here's how to block spam calls on iPhone.\n\nOh, and if you're also facing the problem of unsolicited texts, you\u2019ll want to check out our guide on how to stop spam texts, too.\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll need in order to block spam calls:\n\u2022 An iPhone with iOS 13 or later\n\u2022 Go to the settings page for the Phone app\n\u2022 Go to the App Store\n\u2022 Go to the settings for your Phone app\n\u2022 Under Call Identification Apps, turn the app on or off\n\nLet's start by looking at how to block spam calls by silencing unknown callers.\n\nYour 'Phone' app controls all your contacts, recent calls, your voicemail, and more. To silence unknown callers, you've therefore got to navigate to the settings for this particular app. Thankfully, doing so is incredibly simple. First, tap the Settings app icon on your home screen or in the App Library. Follow this by scrolling down and selecting Apps, followed by Phone.\n\nStep-by-step guide for blocking spam calls using an app\n\nNow, let's go through the steps for blocking spam calls using a third-party app.\n\nWhen you open the app, it'll automatically send you to the Call Blocking & Identification permissions part of your phone. Simply turn on all the toggles for the truecaller app, and you're good to go. If you need to do this manually, you can navigate to Settings > Apps > Phone. From there, tap Call Blocking & Identification. Finally, under Call Identification Apps, turn the app on or off.\n\nWhat if a call is from a trustworthy source but not in my contacts? The 'Silence Unknown Calls' feature will still silence this type of contact. Unfortunately, the only way for Apple to make the necessary filtering distinction is for your contacts list to effectively become a 'safe' list. I wouldn't see this as a problem, though, because if the call genuinely wants to get in touch with you, then they can still leave a voicemail. You can then listen to your voice messages at your leisure and respond when it's convenient to you. Calls from unknown numbers will also appear in your recent calls list, so if you recognize a number in there, then you can always give them a call back.\n\nDoes this feature silence calls from emergency numbers? Unfortunately it does, and there's no getting around that. That being said, if you make an emergency call, then your iPhone will temporarily disable the silencing feature for the next 24 hours. If you are expecting a few of these types of calls within the period of a few days or a week, then you could also consider turning the feature off until you know you won't be receiving any more calls of this type.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 How to block a number on an iPhone\n\u2022 How to know if someone blocked your number\n\u2022 I get annoying spam calls all the time, so I can\u2019t wait for the Call Screening feature in iOS 26",

Here's the full list of supported devices\niOS 26 is now official, with Apple having unveiled the new \u2013 and newly renamed \u2013 software at its WWDC 2025 keynote.\nThis upgrade packs an all-new appearance and a wealth of features and improvements, so it looks set to be the biggest iOS upgrade in quite some time. It\u2019s not yet finished, but we do know what phones it will be compatible with when it launches later this year.\nBelow then, you\u2019ll find a list of the devices that are compatible with iOS 26, and importantly those that have had their final update with iOS 18.\nWhich phones are compatible with iOS 26?\niOS 26 will be available for the following iPhones:\niPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 16e, iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone SE (2020), and iPhone SE (2022).\nIf you have any of these then you\u2019ll be able to update to the finished software when it launches (likely in September), and ahead of that you\u2019ll be able to install iOS 26 betas if you want to try it out early.\nAnd of course, the sure-to-be upcoming iPhone 17 series will also support iOS 26, and these phones will almost certainly ship with the new software.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhich phones aren\u2019t compatible with iOS 26?\nWhile a large number of iPhones are compatible with iOS 26, Apple has dropped support for the iPhone XS, the iPhone XS Max, and the iPhone XR \u2013 so while these phones are compatible with last year\u2019s software (iOS 18) they won\u2019t be able to install iOS 26.\nIt\u2019s likely then that the iPhone 11 series and perhaps the iPhone SE (2020) will be getting their final major update with iOS 26, since they\u2019re the oldest models to be getting it, but we won\u2019t know that for sure until next year.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "Say goodbye to spam calls \u2013 NordVPN launches new spam call protection\nThe new feature comes amid rising financial losses from spam calls\n- NordVPN has introduced Spam Call Protection for US Android users\n- The feature has been designed with user privacy in mind\n- Future updates in the pipeline include caller ID\nNordVPN has announced the launch of Spam Call Protection. Now available to Android users in the US, the new feature alerts users to potential spam calls before they even pick up the phone. This comes as statistics signal a 33% rise in losses from scam calls in 2024.\nThis latest addition to NordVPN\u2019s lineup falls under Threat Protection Pro, its suite of features that boost online security by blocking malware, phishing sites, ads, and trackers. It's a move that sees NordVPN, the best VPN according to TechRadar reviewers, extend its protection beyond the internet.\nNordVPN subscribers on iPhone or located outside the US don\u2019t need to feel left out, though. Not only are further features already in the works, but the cybersecurity company also has plans to bring Spam Call Protection to iOS and more countries.\nScam call protection with users' privacy in mind\nAccording to statistics from the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), over $50 billion has been lost to scam calls in the last five years. Losses in 2024 totaled $16.6 billion, an increase of 33% on the previous year.\nWhat\u2019s clear is that with rising losses from scam calls, this threat isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon, which is where tools like NordVPN\u2019s Scam Call Protection can help.\nScam Call Protection analyzes call patterns and metadata to spot spam calls. A clear warning alerts you to potential scam calls, allowing you to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals. This helps reduce the risk of successful social engineering attacks or phishing attempts, which could lead to financial loss or identity theft.\n\"We\u2019ve always been about protecting people\u2019s digital lives, and phone scams are a huge part of that threat landscape now,\" said Mykolas Dumcius, Chief Product Officer at NordVPN.\n\"The Scam Call Protection feature is our way of extending that protection beyond just internet browsing because your phone shouldn\u2019t be a gateway for scammers either.\"\nCrucially, NordVPN\u2019s Scam Call Protection provides this safeguarding without accessing or storing call content, protecting user privacy in the process \u2013 that\u2019s not guaranteed with all spam call blocking apps, as we\u2019ve seen with the past allegations of Truecaller\u2019s data collection.\nLooking ahead: updates coming to Spam Call Protection\nNordVPN: Today's best VPN\nOur reviewers rank NordVPN as the best VPN service on the market right now for privacy, security, unblocking, and speed. Sign up to NordVPN today to claim TechRadar's exclusive deal and get up to 76% discount, up to $50 of Amazon Gift cards, and 4 months free protection \u2013 or you can still use its 30-day money-back guarantee if you're unhappy.\n\u201cNordVPN is already working on several enhancements to make the feature even more effective,\u201d said Dumcius.\nNordVPN subscribers can expect to see the addition of caller ID to help users separate legitimate numbers from scam ones. Specific call categories will provide users with a better idea of who\u2019s calling, whether that\u2019s a banking institution, healthcare provider, or otherwise.\nUsers will also have the chance to contribute to and improve Spam Call Protection\u2019s call ID database themselves by flagging suspicious numbers as part of a user reporting system.\nIf you\u2019re a NordVPN Plus, Complete, or Prime user in the US, you\u2019ll already have access to this new feature. To take advantage, you need only open NordVPN\u2019s Android app, navigate to Threat Protection, and toggle the Spam Call Protection feature \u2013 an active VPN connection isn\u2019t required either.\nYou might also like\nMark is a Tech Security Writer for TechRadar and has been published on Comparitech and IGN.

      "text": "5 smart privacy features on iPhone you need to know about\nMake sure you\u2019re using these useful iPhone privacy features to keep you safe from prying eyes\nIn recent years, Apple has gone harder on touting how private its iPhones are, from keeping your personal data on the device to prevent prying eyes from following you around when browsing on Safari. In a recent briefing with Apple, four key pillars of privacy were highlighted to me: collect less data, keep private data on device, be transparent in what data is being collected, and keep iPhones secure.\nOut of the box, I feel iPhones tend to offer more default privacy than rivals, including some of the best Android phones; it doesn't hurt that chips like the A18 Pro have a secure kernel that keeps data locked down on a hardware level, and that Face ID has a one-in-a-million chance to hack.\nBut there\u2019s a lot more privacy-centric stuff Apple is doing to help keep your data secure and private than first meets the eye. So I\u2019m here to highlight some of the key privacy features I feel you should know about and make use of.\nHide and lock apps\nIf you want to keep certain apps locked away from prying eyes, such as banking or dating apps, or just tools with a lot of information, like Google Drive, iOS 18 and the upcoming iOS 26 have the ability to lock or hide apps. That way, you can show someone something on your phone without worrying that they could snoop on apps and information they shouldn't.\nApps can be hidden from view by placing them in a hidden folder that can only be accessed with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. To do this, touch and hold an app you wish to hide so that the quick action menu pops up, then tap \u2018Require Face ID\u2019 \u2013 if you\u2019re on an iPhone without Face ID, that option will refer to Touch ID instead.\nFrom there, authenticate yourself using biometrics or a passcode, then tap \u2018Hide App\u2019. That app will then disappear from the Home Screen and move to the \u2018Hidden\u2019 folder at the bottom of the App Library in iOS.\nTo simply lock an app, follow those steps again, but choose \u2018Require Face ID\u2019 in the second pop-up menu. This will then require a biometric or passcode authentication before the app can be accessed.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBrowsing without the tracking\nApple has long positioned Safari as a browser that helps keep your web surfing private. And while some people might want even more privacy, I reckon Safari does a good job at protecting your information and what gets shared with third parties. One of the latest features to be added to Safari is Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which uses machine learning to obfuscate various trackers and websites from creating a digital \u2018fingerprint\u2019 about you.\nThis was previously limited to Safari\u2019s Private Browsing mode, but is now a default in the browser as of iOS 26, which is currently in a public beta and will roll out fully come the Fall.\nBut right now, you can use a feature called Privacy Report that'll actively show you the number of trackers on a website that are being prevented by Safari, in addition to trackers contacted by websites such as Google Analytics. Privacy Report also shows you how many trackers Safari has blocked over the past 30 days and the most prolific tracker that has been trying to build a profile of you.\nThis basically gives you a greater look at what websites do to track users and may help give privacy-conscious folks an idea of what sites they may wish to avoid if they happen not to be using Safari on other devices.\nPrivacy report is accessed by tapping on the menu icon on the left-hand side of Safari's search bar, then tapping on the three dots to open up more options, and then tapping on the Privacy report option at the top of the menu to get your report on the page you're viewing and a general privacy overview.\nKeeping your email private\nI\u2019ve lost count of how many services and websites want me to create an account to do the most simple things like log into public Wi-Fi or to make a one-off purchase, which means my personal email address can be pretty public. Apple\u2019s solution to this is the Hide My Email function that provides a way to create a unique, random email address to use with websites and apps so you can keep your actual email address private.\nYou\u2019ll still get emails from these random addresses that are forwarded to your personal inbox. But rather than needing to keep on top of multiple \u2018burner\u2019 emails, these addresses can all be managed in one place via iCloud and deactivated or reactivated as you see fit.\nOne minor caveat here is you\u2019ll need to be an iCloud+ subscriber to get access to this \u2013 Apple is pro-privacy but explained it needs to charge for this due to the fact that ongoing traffic management is needed to deliver such a service \u2013 but if you\u2019re already deep in the Apple ecosystem that shouldn't be a beyond the pale.\nTackle the unknown\nWith iOS 26, Apple is enhancing its approach to tackling spam messages and communications. There are additional options in how scam and spam messages are handled thanks to a reworked Messages app in the upcoming version of iOS 26.\nBut a core element is how unknown senders are dealt with. In Messages, ones from unknown contacts are routed to a dedicated area where you can decide if they are actually from known people, if they are spam and need to be deleted, or if more information is required to ascertain who the sender is.\nThe new Call Screening feature will automatically scan calls from unknown numbers before they are connected and ask the caller to identify themselves and give a reason for the call. Once done, the Phones app will then let an iPhone call, and the gathered information will be served up to the user, letting them decide whether to accept the call or not.\nFighting theft\nA feature that\u2019s been on iPhone since iOS 17.3, yet is only used by 50% of people, is the Stolen Device Protection option in the native Find My app. It\u2019s off by default, but once enabled in the \u2018Privacy & Security\u2019 part of Settings, it will provide an extra layer of protection for your Apple account if your iPhone is lost or stolen, and is outside of predetermined familiar locations, such as your home (unless the feature is set to be always on).\nThis comes in the form of not letting a thief change your account or device password if they manage to have access to your phone or have learned its passcode, as Face ID or Touch ID needs to be used in tandem with the passcode to make such changes or switch off the Lost Mode that locks the phone down.\nThis should help fight against social engineering schemes that use phishing emails or fake customer support calls to access your account password and verification, as biometric security is needed at the same time.\nSome of these features you may be using already, and some are coming soon, but those above should give you a taste of the privacy features and tools iPhones offer. Do you make use of them? Or do you have your own iPhone privacy tips?

      "text": "How to block a number on an iPhone\nBlocking a phone number to prevent the other person from texting or calling you on your iPhone is a very simple process that can be done in just a few quick taps.\nNowadays, telemarketing has never been more prevalent and consequently, for many people, more annoying. Some manufacturers are going for advanced, AI-powered features to protect their users from unwanted calls and texts, but these services are reserved only for the best phones on the market.\nLuckily, every iPhone comes with a simple feature to manually block a number. You can do that in two different ways, here is how:\n- If you're an Android user, check out our guide for how to block a number on Android, as the process is ever so slightly different.\nSteps for how to block a number on an iPhone\n- Open the Contacts app and find the number you want to block\n- Open the number's profile\n- Find and tap the Block this Caller button\nStep-by-step guide: Blocking the number from Contacts\n1. Head to Contacts app\nFirstly, you'll want to open your contacts app, which is the green tile with a white handset icon that is found on your iPhone's home dock by default.\nThen find the number you want to block. Depending on who it is your blocking, it might be a number from your contacts or from your recent calls.\n2. Open the number's profile\nIf you're blocking someone from your contacts, simply tap their name to open their Contact profile.\nIf you're blocking someone from your list of recent calls, tap the encircled 'i' button to the right of the call log to open their Contact profile.\n3. Tap Block this Caller\nScroll down a little and you'll see a button labeled Block this caller - tap this. It's worth noting that if you're blocking a contact with multiple phone numbers assigned to them, this will block all of the associated numbers from calling your iPhone.\nThis Contact or individual caller will now be added to your block list. If you ever need to check which numbers are in that list or unblock a caller, follow the first two steps of the next method.\nStep-by-step guide: Blocking the number from Settings\n1. Head to the Settings app\nIf you want to also see your list of already-blocked contacts, the best bet for blocking a number is to head to your iPhone's Settings app. It's worth noting you'll need to save the number you want to block first as a Contact.\nScroll down to the fifth group of Settings menus and tap Phone, which is about halfway down the list.\n2. View your Blocked Contacts\nScroll down a little until you get to the group of options including Blocked Contacts - tap this.\nYou'll then be taken to a list of any contacts you've already blocked. At the end of this list, you'll see an option to Add new, from where you can block an existing contact from your saved contacts. Tap the name of the contact you want to block, and you're all set.\nFrom this list, you can also edit to unblock numbers and Contacts, should you need to.\nFAQs\nHow do I unblock a blocked Contact or number?\nIn case you change your mind and want to go back on your decision, first you\u2019ll need to go to your Phone settings in the Settings app and view your blocked contacts. Then, tap Edit to unblock the number or contact you wish to hear from again.\nFinal thoughts\nAs you\u2019ve seen, blocking both Contacts and numbers on your iPhone is no hassle, and you only need to go through a few steps to make it happen.\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t preemptively block a number if you don\u2019t have them in your contacts list first. This is hardly a major issue, but it is somewhat annoying nonetheless, especially if this is your first time using an iPhone, or if you\u2019re transferring your block list from a non-Apple device.\nWhile we\u2019re on that topic, make sure to check out our guide on how to switch from Android to iPhone to help you speed up the process.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJosephine Watson (@JosieWatson) is TechRadar's Managing Editor - Lifestyle.

The report also estimates that just shy of 24 million people in the UK will get access to Call Screening, working out to more than 1.1 billion intercepted calls each year.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPersonally, I can\u2019t stand spam calls, and there have been days \u2013 and even whole months \u2013 where I seem to get much more than the estimated four calls.\nAdditionally, I get plenty of calls that drop as soon as I pick up, or as soon as I say something. It\u2019s never nice to imagine that my number\u2019s been scraped or marked as \u2018active\u2019 in a database for scammers.\nTo be honest, the issue is so prevalent that I sometimes don\u2019t pick up the phone at all, instead waiting for a voicemail or follow-up email to know exactly who's trying to reach me.\nThe addition of Call Screening could see me pop the SIM card out of my trusty Oppo Find X8 Pro and back into one of the best iPhones, for the sake of using my phone as an actual phone again.\nWith that said, the official Apple press release for iOS 26 doesn't make it clear whether Call Screening is an Apple Intelligence feature, in which case my iPhone 15 would be out of luck.\nWWDC saw the announcement of plenty more features for iPhone, iPad, and Mac \u2013 head over to our WWDC2025 recap for a full rundown.\nAnd be sure to let us know whether you\u2019re looking forward to using Call Screening on your iPhone in the comments below.\nYou might also like\nJamie is a Mobile Computing Staff Writer for TechRadar, responsible for covering phones and tablets.

      "text": "How to stop spam texts\nIn today's digital age, spam texts have become a common nuisance, interrupting our daily lives with unwanted advertisements, phishing attempts, and sometimes, malicious links. So knowing how to stop spam texts is rather useful.\nSpam texts are not just annoying; they can also be dangerous, potentially leading to identity theft or malware installation. Fortunately, both Android and iOS platforms offer tools and settings to combat these unwanted messages. By following the steps below, you can significantly reduce the number of spam texts you receive and enjoy a more secure messaging experience.\nThis guide will walk you through how to stop spam texts on both Android and iOS devices. Just note that, the Android phone used to create the screenshots was a Google Pixel 8 Pro, but the steps should work in a similar way on any Android phone.\nHow to stop spam texts on an Android phone\n1. Select account and open options\nGo to your messages app and click on your account icon at the top right of the screen.\n2. Select Message settings\nFrom the drop-down list, select Message settings.\n3. Select spam protection\nFrom the Settings list, select 'Spam protection'.\n4. Enable Spam protection\nOn the Spam protection page, move the toggle for 'Enable spam protection' to the 'on' position.\nEnabling this option should prevent most of the spam texts sent to your phone from reaching your inbox.\n5. Block spam texts manually\nEven with Spam protection activated, some spam text messages may still get through.\nYou can block the senders of these messages manually by selecting 'Yes, report' and 'Report spam'. You have now blocked this sender.\nHow to stop spam texts on an iPhone\n1. Go to Messages in Settings\nGo to Settings and select Messages.\n2. Filter Unknown Senders\nIn the Messages menu, scroll down to 'Filter Unknown Senders' and move the toggle to the 'on' position. This will put messages from senders who aren't in your contacts into a separate list.\n3. Manually block numbers\nIf you don't want to filter all messages from unknown senders, you can choose to block senders manually. To do this, select 'Report Junk' and confirm the action on the next screen.\nFinal thoughts\nEffectively combating spam texts on both Android and iOS involves using built-in tools, reporting unwanted messages, and manually blocking spammers. There are also other measures you can take, including downloading third-party apps like Truecaller or RoboKiller. These apps enhance your defense against spam with advanced detection capabilities.\nActively opting out of commercial messages and being cautious about sharing your phone number also play an important role in minimizing spam. The more your number is out there, the more likely it is to be scooped up by spammers. Be mindful of where and with whom you share your contact information, whether it's online forms, social media platforms, or contests.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nEmma Street is a freelance content writer who contributes technology and finance articles to a range of websites, including TechRadar, Tom's Guide, Top10.com, and BestMoney.

      "text": "4 surprising ways you can gain control of your kid's screen time on the iPhone and iPad\nI don't know if there's a right age for an iPhone, but I think most can agree that there should be different smartphone and online experiences based on age, and that's really the philosophy behind most digital parental controls, including the fairly voluminous ones found across Apple's ecosystem. Now, with iOS 26 \u2013 and other platform updates \u2013 on the horizon, that system is set for a series of small but important updates.\nI've seen most of them in action and, on the whole, I think these may be just the series of privacy and safety controls parents and, yes, even teens and kids, have been looking for.\nTo Apple's credit, it's been adding to and enhancing its parental control ecosystem for years. So much so that many parents may only scratch the surface of its vast platform of controls.\nWorth noting that if you identify a new device like an iPhone or iPad as going to a child or teen, many of the controls, like web content restrictions, app restrictions (apps rated 4-plus only), screen distance alerts, and messaging filters that automatically blur out the naughty bits, will function automatically.\nThere are, though, key safety changes that you can enable when Apple releases public versions of its OS updates for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\nThe age of appropriateness\nYour child's iPhone and iPad are already pretty good, based on your Parental Control settings, at managing your kid's access to age-appropriate apps, but Apple is going further in iOS26, iPadOS26, and macOS 26 (essentially any platform that's part of your Family Plan and that can access the App Store).\nAge Appropriate Experiences seems designed to help prevent App developers from inadvertently delivering inappropriate in-app content to your children and teens. It's enabled through a series of simple screen prompts that let you supply the age (but not birthdate) of your children to developers.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nUsing this information, developers can ensure that regardless of which apps you let them download, their apps only deliver content that aligns with the child's age.\nI appreciate that there's another level of control: parents can choose if the Age range is \"Always\" shared, if developers have to \"Ask First\", or if it's \"Never\" shared. I think I like the second option best because it's the only one that allows the child to choose if they want their age range shared with developers.\nGetting the right message\nOnce your child has an iPhone and a phone number, it's almost guaranteed that they will be targeted by predators. There is a simple setting in iOS right now that lets you automatically block unknown numbers (Filter Unknown Senders under Settings/Apps/Messages). However, iOS 26 will take these protections further.\nWith iOS 26, your child won't be able to add just anyone to their contacts and messaging lists.\nIf your child wants to add a study buddy to messaging on their iPhone or iPad, they'll see a new pop-up that will let them \"Ask a Parent or Guardian to Approve this Person\".\nIf the child or teen selects the pop-up, a pre-populated message appears where they can fill in the friend's details and add a message explaining who the person is. Parents get a time-sensitive notification on their devices with the details and message. They can choose to add the contact, decline, or select \"Not now.\"\nOnce the friend is added, your child or teen will get a message telling them they can call or message the new contact. Of course, it might make sense to pause in the middle of this process to chat in person with your kid and make sure the \"study buddy\" is really just another kid.\nApps less limited\nApple's parental controls make it quite easy to set time limits and even exclude apps from view so that when your child searches the App Store, they won't even see those not-age-appriate apps in the App Store.\nApple, though, appears to have recognized that some kids are, well, sneaky.\nWhen you set time limit controls at an app level or even globally, your child can request more time with the app. Approving the extension requires the parent's passcode, which they can enter remotely from their best iPhone or best iPad, or in person if they happen to be sitting next to their kid. If the kid has been surreptitiously watching you enter the passcode and has it memorized, they could be granting themselves more screen time.\nWith this small yet useful upcoming update, parents will receive notifications whenever their passcode is used.\nMaking the exception\nParents get to choose which apps their kids can access, but there will soon be a new button at the top of App description pages that will offer the ability to request an exception.\nThat request goes to parents who can grant permission, which immediately turns on the \"Get\" option on an app.\nThis might come in handy when, say, your child has a project where some YouTube research will come in handy. However, when the project is done, you can just as quickly revoke the exception, and then not only does access in the App Store disappear, but the app also disappears from your child's device.\nThis is a level of control I can get behind.\nTell us how you manage your child's screen time in the comments below.\nYou might also like\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d He\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for Ziff Davis, Inc.

      "text": "How to know if someone blocked your number\nThere are few big mysteries in the information age, but one of them is knowing how to figure out whether someone has blocked your number.\nI'm talking about your number being blocked on someone else's phone, which is a side function that ensures calls and texts from a specific number don't go through. It's got nothing to do with social media and it's also separate from WhatsApp blocking, which just functions on the app. Number blocking also isn't managed by cell companies or your phone's maker \u2013 it's solely a feature that works on your specific phone.\nThere's no concrete way to know whether someone has blocked your number. If your digits inhabit someone else's blocked list, it's impossible to know for sure without checking that list yourself.\nHowever, if you're awaiting a response to a message or a callback, and you're suspicious that someone has blocked you, there are a few things you can do that'll give you an indication. They're not ironclad, so don't take them as gospel, but they might help you ease your mind a little. I'd always recommend giving the potential blocker some time and space before you try these methods, though.\nBy the way, if you've got an iPhone, here's how to know if someone blocked you in iMessage.\nTools and requirements\nTo know if someone has blocked your phone number, the only thing you'll need is the phone with which that number is associated. However, it can help to have a separate phone, for a reason we'll get to later.\nQuick steps to check if someone has blocked your number\nAt a glance, here are a few courses of action that might hint at whether your number has been blocked or not. I'd recommend reading the full article, including the Troubleshooting section, before proceeding.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n- Give the phone a ring to see if the call is declined (and optionally, try with another number)\n- Send a text to see whether the message is received (only on certain phones)\n- Give the suspected blocker some time to respond, or ask around\nStep-by-step guide to check if someone has blocked your number\nNow let's run through those aforementioned methods in greater detail.\n1. The phone call method\nWe'll start with the phone call method. To do this, ring the person you think blocked you using your smartphone's call app (you can see the stock Android one pictured above).\nListen to how many rings you hear. If the call keeps ringing for a while, it's likely that you haven't been blocked (and if the person answers the phone, that's always a surefire sign!).\nHowever, if the call is dropped after the first ring, that's a possible sign that your phone number has been blocked.\nIt's not a guarantee, though. Perhaps the person manually declined your call after one ring, or they've got a filter on that blocks out all calls. It may be something else too, like if your number has fallen foul of a spam detection tool and the recipient's phone thinks you're a robo-caller.\nA way to get some clarity is to call with another phone: if it rings for the same amount of time as your main phone, then you're almost definitely not blocked. If it rings for longer, then perhaps that's an indication, but for the reasons I've said already, it's not concrete.\n2. Send a text\nAnother thing worth testing is a good old-fashioned text message to the suspected blocker. However, this only works on certain phones.\nOn iPhones, you can see read receipts to know whether someone has read your message. When you text the number of someone who's blocked you, the read receipts won't show up.\nOn Android, it's more complicated. Certain brands of phone support read receipts, usually if you're sending a text to someone else with the same brand, but that's not always the case. That's also true of sending texts between Android phones of different brands, or to or from iPhones on an Android.\nBecause of the Android complication, it's also tricky to use this method as confirmation. Maybe the person you're texting hasn't blocked you, but has just switched to Android, or maybe a bug is stopping the read receipts from going through.\n3. Give the person some time to respond, or ask around\nIf you're worried that someone has blocked you, this third option is the hardest one, but it's also the best one: take a step back.\nMaybe the person hasn't blocked you, but is simply busy: sometimes it's easy to forget to respond to someone for days or even weeks (or even months, if you're forgetful like me). They might be traveling somewhere where they don't have a cell plan, causing them to turn on airplane mode for the duration of the trip, or have made a conscious decision to spend less time on their phone for whatever reason.\nJust give the person some space and more often than not, time will tell whether they've actually blocked you or not.\nAnother option is simply to ask around: maybe a mutual friend will be able to tell you whether they've blocked you or are simply very busy.\nTroubleshooting\nWhat if it looks like someone has blocked me?\nIt can be upsetting if someone blocks you, but it's best to avoid pestering the blocker to unblock you via other platforms or apps (or in person). Instead, you should try and come to terms with their decision.\nMaybe there's someone you can talk to who'll help you understand or process your feelings about the situation, or maybe meditation or journaling will help you clear your head.\nMany countries have laws against sending repeated unwanted text messages, especially if they're insulting or abusive, so make sure to leave the blocker alone and refrain from texting or calling them further.\nHow do I block someone?\nYou can block numbers on your phone using the Settings app on iPhones, or the Settings menu of the Phone app on Android. Depending on your phone, you can sometimes also set auto-blocking filters for spam calls too.\nYou might also like\nTom Bedford joined TechRadar in early 2019 as a staff writer, and left the team as deputy phones editor in late 2022 to work for entertainment site (and TR sister-site) What To Watch.
