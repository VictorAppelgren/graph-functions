  "content": "Jazz Chisholm hit the 100th and 101st home runs of his career on Sunday, one day after the passing of his best friend. AP\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Jazz Chisholm Jr. shook his head and leaned down as he buried his face into Aaron Judge\u2019s chest, getting a big hug in the Yankees\u2019 dugout.\n\nChisholm had just circled the bases after the 100th home run of his big-league career, his first of two blasts in Sunday night\u2019s much-needed win over the Red Sox. In that moment, however, the second baseman\u2019s mind was elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt felt kind of surreal,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cI lost my best friend yesterday. Today felt like a different type of day, especially with the 100th home run coming today and everything.\u201d\n\nChisholm was asked for more details about his best friend, but he explained that he\u2019d like to keep it all private, at least for now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going through a lot in the last 30 hours,\u201d he said.\n\nChisholm\u2019s milestone homer came in his first at-bat of the night, a towering two-run shot to right field off Red Sox righty Dustin May.\n\nHe then swatted another two-run blast in the eighth, a low line drive over the short porch off right-hander Walker Buehler that gave the Yankees a few more valuable insurance runs. They went on to win 7-2.\n\n\u201cIt makes it feel even better that we won the game, especially against the team that\u2019s really been beating us a lot this year,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cThat should take us into a good momentum right now.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees had lost eight games in a row against Boston before their victory on Sunday night. They\u2019ll welcome the last-place Nationals into town on Monday for a three-game set as the Yankees wrap up their homestand.\n\nIf the Yankees can continue to score runs like they did on Sunday \u2014 Trent Grisham also hit two homers and Giancarlo Stanton stayed hot at the plate \u2014 then they\u2019ll be in good shape to start rattling off some wins leading into the final month of the regular season.\n\n\u201cWhen everything\u2019s going well, that\u2019s how we are,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cWe hit homers, we score a lot of runs and we walk a lot. I feel like that was our game tonight. We had a lot of walks, hit a couple home runs and played great defense. That\u2019s what we\u2019re really known for.\u201d\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
