  "argos_summary": "TPG Telecom reported a 1.3% profit margin and EPS of AU$0.017, up from 0.3% and AU$0.004 in H1\u202f2024, but revenue is expected to remain flat over the next three years despite a 3.3% growth forecast for the Australian telecom sector. The company\u2019s share price has been largely unchanged, and it underperforms the broader Australian telecom industry, which returned 27.3% last year. Analysts project modest earnings growth of 48\u202f% and EPS growth of 51\u202f% over three years, while the company remains unprofitable with a negative EPS of \u2013AU$0.044. The article also highlights a list of 23 leading quantum\u2011computing firms, ranging from hardware manufacturers to software developers, underscoring the broader tech shift toward quantum technologies.",
