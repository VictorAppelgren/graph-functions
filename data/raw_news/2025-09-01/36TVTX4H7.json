  "title": "Hammond Power Solutions (TSE:HPS.A) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of CA$0.275",
  "description": "The board of Hammond Power Solutions Inc. ( TSE:HPS.A ) has announced that it will pay a dividend of CA$0.275 per share...",
  "content": "The board of Hammond Power Solutions Inc. (TSE:HPS.A) has announced that it will pay a dividend of CA$0.275 per share on the 25th of September. The dividend yield is 0.9% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nIt would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Based on the last payment, Hammond Power Solutions was earning enough to cover the dividend, but free cash flows weren't positive. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 6.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 18%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Hammond Power Solutions\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was CA$0.24 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was CA$1.10. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 16% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.\n\nThe Dividend Looks Likely To Grow\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Hammond Power Solutions has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 41% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.\n\nIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Hammond Power Solutions' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Hammond Power Solutions that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.
