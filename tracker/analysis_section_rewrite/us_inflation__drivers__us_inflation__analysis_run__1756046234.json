      "feedback": "Strong base-case Regime A framing with AI/cloud and the Intel governance signal is solid, but to reach world‑class level you need a tighter, fully sourced causal chain, tighter quantification, and a crisp watch-list. Specifically: (1) tighten the causal chain from macro/policy to market transmission: state clearly (a) policy path (Sept cut 25–50 bp; yields mid-4%), (b) resulting discount-rate/financing environment, (c) AI/cloud capex momentum, (d) platform‑breadth effects (MSFT/Azure +39%, Shopify GMV +27%, revenue +29% in Q2’25) and how that feeds GMV → revenue → margins and cash flow, with explicit linkages and sensitivities; anchor each claim to GX057ADL7, J99EM2TPZ, and RHXDOHQQX. (2) fix incomplete items and reconcile sources: correct the truncated Regime B reference and any unfinished phrases (the draft shows “Regime B ce” and “sourc”); ensure coverage of all critical inputs from the four core sources and reconcile any tensions (oil oversupply vs demand weakness from J99EM2TPZ and IEA’s 2.5 mbpd supply rise for 2025). (3) quantify where possible beyond qualitative statements: translate the macro signals into plausible ranges for S&P 500 earnings or multiples under Regime A, and attach explicit, source-backed numbers (e.g., Azure +39%, Shopify GMV +27%, revenue +29%) to demonstrate channel strength; (4) expand the cross-topic synthesis with a concise valuation/technical read: specify how multiple expansion or compression under a mid-4% yields regime would impact AI infra names versus other staples, and show expected delta to cash flows; (5) augment the threat/fragility narrative with concrete scenarios and invalidation tests: e.g., if Sept‑cut is smaller or delayed, if Intel disclosures surprise on leverage or governance direction, if tariff terms extend beyond 90 days or escalate, or if oil-market signals shift contrary to IEA expectations; (6) sharpen the three primary trigger paths into explicit thresholds, timing, and observable data points (e.g., policy guidance next, Intel stake disclosures, tariff-term updates beyond 90 days, IEA oil‑supply/demand inflection points); (7) strengthen the watch-list with specific timelines and a short list of decisive signals; (8) intensify citation discipline so every substantive claim is anchored to one of GX057ADL7, J99EM2TPZ, or RHXDOHQQX, and avoid any claims without a source; (9) improve readability and horizon alignment by front‑loading a one‑sentence thesis, then a tight two‑layer map (macro/policy then company/sector channels), followed by a brief watch-list and risks, keeping the piece within medium/current horizon constraints.",
