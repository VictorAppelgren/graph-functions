  "content": "Kevin O\u2019Leary has divulged his five most important tips on wealth management and life.\n\nWhat Happened: O\u2019Leary, who sold his software company to Mattel in 1999 for a staggering $4.2 billion, shared some valuable advice.\n\nHis five crucial tips are: stop squandering money, concentrate your efforts, listen more than you talk, address financial matters early in a relationship, and instill self-reliance in children.\n\nSpeaking with the Insider O\u2019Leary said, \u201cStop buying $7 coffees. Don\u2019t pay 40 bucks for lunch. Make it yourself. Ask yourself every time you\u2019re about to buy something: Do I really need this?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary underscored the necessity of financial prudence, cautioning against frivolous spending. He further highlighted the importance of investing, stating that an individual earning $70,000 annually could retire a millionaire if they consistently invest 15% of their monthly income in a diversified portfolio from their late 20s until the age of 65.\n\nO\u2019Leary emphasized the power of active listening, calling it a \u201csuperpower.\u201d \u201cYou have to learn how to shut up,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso Read: Kevin O\u2019Leary Advocates Entrepreneurship Over Consulting to Students: \u2018Why Would Anybody Burn All Those Hours While Someone Else Makes Money?\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s akin to having your ear to the rail and hearing the train coming down the track that\u2019s going to run you over,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, adding, \u201cTo know to get off the track. That\u2019s what listening does,\u201d O\u2019Leary continued.\n\nRegarding productivity, O\u2019Leary suggested identifying three primary tasks each day and focusing on their completion. He also encouraged employees who find themselves in disagreement with their company\u2019s direction to explore other job prospects.\n\nHe also suggested discussing financial matters by the third date and signing a prenuptial agreement before tying the knot.\n\nLastly, O\u2019Leary cautioned against the \u201ccurse of entitlement\u201d for the offspring of wealthy parents, recommending teaching self-reliance to evade a \u201csea of mediocrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk in their life has been removed. They\u2019ve been guaranteed a free ride for the rest of their lives. They become lost in a sea of mediocrity. It\u2019s a disaster for them,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s advice comes from a place of experience and success, making it invaluable for those seeking to improve their financial situation and life management skills.\n\nHis emphasis on financial prudence, investing, productivity, communication, and self-reliance are key principles that can guide individuals towards a prosperous and fulfilling life.\n\nShark Tank's Kevin O'Leary Outraged Over Fine Against Donald Trump In NY Civil Fraud Case: \u2018It's Appalling.

He's also the founder of O'Leary Funds and O'Leary Ventures, and has invested in companies such as Basepaws on \"Shark Tank.\"\nThe 71-year-old said that working, especially past 60, keeps people's minds sharp, and that doing things \"outside of your comfort zone\" that cause you some \"stress\" has been key to his staying healthy in body and mind as he's aged.\nThe self-proclaimed \"Mr. Wonderful\" said he relishes competing and \"being in the game.\" When others predict he'll fail at a challenge, it \"just motivates me to go kick ass\" in that industry, he said.\n\"I just love it when people say I can't do something,\" he added.\nO\u2019Leary's latest adventure isn't investing or starting a company: he has a major role alongside Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in \"Uncut Gems\" director Josh Safdie's next movie, \"Marty Supreme.\"\nThe celebrity investor told Business Insider he initially balked at the idea as he had no experience performing from a script. He recalled the producers replying, \"We don't care, we're not asking you to act. We're looking for a real asshole, and you're it. We just want that guy that we know from 'Shark Tank.'\"\nO'Leary said he \"never looked back\" and was soon on set. O'Leary's performance is prominent in the movie's trailer, which gives him fourth billing behind Chalamet, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Odessa A'zion.\n\"I think that helped me in business. I think it helped me be disciplined,\" O'Leary said of the \"remarkable\" experience.\nWine and worry\nAsked what keeps him up at night, O'Leary replied that his \"one sin\" is \"drinking wine too close to bedtime.\"\nO'Leary said he's \"really into longevity\" \u2014 minding what he eats, not smoking or taking drugs, and trying to exercise daily. But he said he's found \"the older I get, the better the wine gets.\"\nSleep is so vital that you \"can't let your problems keep you awake, because that's very unhealthy,\" O'Leary said.\nO'Leary told Business Insider that there are always good and bad days, describing that as \"volatility\" in business, relationships, and life.\nHe said he'd recently received a \"catastrophic\" call from one of the entrepreneurs he had invested in, saying their company was being sued. Twenty minutes later, he learned on another call that one of his team's investments six years ago would be going public, and he stood to make 43 times his money.\n\"So there's utter despair, and a few minutes later, utter euphoria,\" he said. \"Sometimes the poo-poo hits the fan one hour. And then something beautiful happens the next. You've got to roll with it,\" he added."

Details here \u2192\nKevin O'Leary strongly condemned a New York court's ruling that fined former President Donald Trump $355 million, calling the decision \"unjust,\" \"appalling\" and \"un-American.\"\nThe Manhattan Supreme Court's ruling, delivered by Justice Arthur Engoron on Friday, not only imposed a significant financial penalty on Trump but also temporarily prohibited him from engaging in business activities within New York.\nO'Leary, renowned for his role on \"Shark Tank,\" condemned the judgment for potentially setting a precarious precedent for the real estate sector, reported the New York Post.\n\"It\u2019s appalling. It\u2019s unjust. I would go as far to say it\u2019s un-American,\" he said.\nO'Leary has been vocal in his skepticism about the fraud case's outcome, previously stating on CNN that he doubted the ruling would hold up under appeal.\nAccording to the entrepreneur and businessman, the ruling's implications are not only detrimental to Trump but also to the entire business community in New York.\nAlso Read: Trumped-up Charges?

Details here \u2192\nKevin O\u2019Leary, the famed investor and star of \u201cShark Tank,\u201d urged students at Harvard to forgo the traditional consulting route and instead establish their own businesses.\nWhat Happened: In his role as an Executive Fellow at the prestigious Ivy League school, O\u2019Leary expressed his belief that dedicating two years to a consulting firm could result in a mediocre career.\nHe suggested that consultants are often viewed as indecisive, which could hinder their professional growth.\nO\u2019Leary, who is also the founder of the $4.2 billion company, SoftKey Software Products, is committed to motivating his students to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset.
