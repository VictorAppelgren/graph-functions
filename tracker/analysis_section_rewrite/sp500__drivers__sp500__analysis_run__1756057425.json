      "feedback": "The draft has a coherent productivity-driven thesis and regime framing, but it needs a sharper, testable causal chain, explicit scenario logic, and quantified, source-anchored inputs to reach world-class quality; currently it slides from drivers to outcomes with sparse linkage to valuation and lacks a rigorous watchlist. Actionable edits: recast into a single, testable chain—AI-enabled productivity uplift expands margins and pricing power, lifting ROIC and cash flow, with the path contingent on retraining/UBI stabilizing demand (anchor with NL5YYTLF2); calibrate with concrete base-case numbers (ACMR: 2025 revenue ≈ $900m, GM ≈ 4%; Ford-style ROIC ≈ 10%, per 22PL3Q360) to ground discount-rate and valuation sensitivities (22PL3Q360); replace generic prose with two explicit regimes—Regime A (inflation converges to target, gradual policy easing, real-rate differential to neutral aligned with the inflation/productivity impulse, per 37UZC9X8I/NL5YYTLF2) and Regime B (sticky inflation, wage growth decelerates, tighter conditions)—and attach clear triggers and invalidation points (e.g., wage-price momentum vs target, counterfactual policy shifts) tied to the same sources; build a four-topic ledger that maps macro/productivity, policy-rate path, flows/positioning (AI-capex allocation), and valuations/techniques, with explicit cross‑topic channels; integrate cross-market anchors from oil oversupply (J99EM2TPZ) and IEA 2025 supply shifts, plus the EURUSD four-regime spine (5S9GJV2O3; UVEQ2SJ0W; HWGNUP2XG) to generate price-path sensitivities, and then present a concise reconciliation of conflicts where productivity gains clash with policy frictions or commodity cycles; finally, assemble a decisive watchlist of signals with thresholds: wage-inflation convergence pace, AI-capex breakthrough indicators, megadeal governance episodes, oil-supply surprise magnitude, and 10Y/EURUSD moves beyond predefined bands, with each item annotated by the relevant source IDs (NL5YYTLF2, 37UZC9X8I, 22PL3Q360, J99EM2TPZ, 5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, HWGNUP2XG) to ensure density, coverage, and conflicts are reconciled.",
