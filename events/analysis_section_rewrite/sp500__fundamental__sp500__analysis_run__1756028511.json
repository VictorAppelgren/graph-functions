      "feedback": "Strong draft, but to reach world‑class you need a multi‑year, regime‑based, first‑principles framework that ties macro/inflation/credit dynamics to cloud/AI cash flows and then to stock pricing. Actionable edits: (1) insert a First‑Principles section anchored in invariant anchors (real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity gains from AI, and policy reaction functions) and specify how these drive long‑run discount rates, capex cycles, and ROIC in software/cloud franchises; (2) lay out explicit regimes and transition conditions (Regime A: cloud/AI capex upcycle with durable margin and FCF expansion; Regime B: plateau/maturation with slower growth and potential multiple compressions; Regime C: stress/credit tightening or AI‑regulatory shock) with trigger thresholds drawn from sources (e.g., cloud spend CAGR from Grand View Research cited in the cloud‑stocks piece is 21.2% CAGR from 2024–2030; MSFT Azure/AI growth and a contracted revenue base signal durable visibility in 0G3A676BP/48JXC9VDP); (3) tighten the causal chain: cloud/AI growth drives revenue/FCF for platform leaders (MSFT Azure growth 39% YoY; Q4 FY2025 revenue up 18%; contracted revenue $368B), which powers higher cash returns, steadier cash flows, and moats; then feeds stock pricing via discount rates and multiples, with dispersion arising from balance‑sheet quality (e.g., PRGS ROE 13% but debt/equity 322% and declining earnings in DBFSBGOEX; BDX PEG ~54% per 0VMWQTKHB; SLB shareholder yield 65% per 9X7XOLXMH); (4) replace broad assertions with explicit, source‑backed scenarios and sensitivities: base case, upside (cloud spend accelerates to the 21.2% CAGR path), and downside (cloud capex slows to mid‑teens; smaller software like Progress exhibits leverage risk); (5) improve base‑case numerics and timelines: quote the 31% Q2 revenue growth and 16% FCF margin for Shopify, 31% YoY revenue, and 422M FCF (0G3A676BP/48JXC9VDP) and hedge with cash‑return metrics from SLB/BDX as appropriate; (6) address conflicts transparently: acknowledge that while the cloud thesis is robust, debt‑heavy names (PRGS) or PEG films (BDX) warn about leverage and valuation risk; (7) articulate “what to watch” with concrete metrics and cadence (Azure growth rate, MSFT cloud contribution to margins, Shopify GMV growth, cloud capex intensity, and any shift in AI‑policy landscape) with explicit source links/IDs; (8) restructure the write to end with the Horizon/Regime map, a concise base case, key risks, watchlist, and a stated confidence band; (9) ensure every numeric claim cites an ID from SOURCE MATERIAL and reconcile any conflicting signals in a short synthesis rather than a single line of causation; (10) tighten prose to avoid hedging or overgeneralization (e.g., “forever stock” should be tempered with explicit discounting/valuation discipline). Integrating these steps will yield a coherent, multi‑year, first‑principles narrative that honors the horizon, uses the cited sources (notably 48JXC9VDP for the cloud/AI cloud‑stock view and Grand View Research’s CAGR; 0G3A676BP for MSFT/SHOP fundamentals; DBFSBGOEX, 0VMWQTKHB, 9X7XOLXMH for counterpoints), and delivers a robust base case, clear risks, and actionable watch cues.",
