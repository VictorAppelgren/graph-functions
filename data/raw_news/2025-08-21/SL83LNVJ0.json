  "description": "Amid budget constraints, leaders face a choice: cut blindly or invest with precision in the programs that matter most.",
  "content": "I\u2019m noticing a quiet shift underway in the C-suite. In the face of economic uncertainty and accelerating disruption from AI, many leaders are pulling back budgets \u2013 and also reexamining long-held assumptions about people investment.\n\nBudget conversations are becoming more demanding. Programs that once felt untouchable are now being paused, downsized, or reexamined through the lens of cost and contribution. Even foundational people programs are not immune from scrutiny.\n\nWhere growth and innovation once dominated the agenda, we\u2019re now seeing a return to discipline, selectivity, and proof. , , and have all pointed to a business landscape shaped by economic caution. see over two-thirds of CEOs reallocating resources with precision, focusing on bets they can measure, and pulling back on the rest.\n\nAnd nowhere is this shift more visible \u2013 or more painful \u2013 than in human resources. Very few HR teams say they are increasing spend this year. Gartner reports that 65% of HR leaders anticipate flat or declining budgets in 2025 , and those who are spending are doing so on tech tools, not employee experience.\n\nExecutives are taking a closer look at whether their workforce strategies are still aligned to value, and whether the programs they\u2019ve supported in the past are delivering what the business needs now.\n\nI\u2019ve led Workhuman through three eras of turbulence \u2014 the dot-com crash, the 2008 financial crisis, and COVID-19. Each time I learned the same lesson: cuts may be unavoidable, but you have to protect the core of culture and the employer deal. That\u2019s what carries you through\n\nWhat\u2019s emerging is a new mandate: to justify every people investment with clearer signals of impact, and to make those decisions with greater speed, precision, and accountability.\n\nThe Risk of Getting It Wrong\n\nIn times like these, the instinct is often to freeze and eliminate programs. However, this is not a moment for blind cutting. It\u2019s a moment for cutting with clarity \u2013 and for understanding what \u2013 and who \u2013 is quietly keeping your company alive.\n\nThe leaders I talk to certainly aren\u2019t looking to slash indiscriminately. They want to prune carefully, removing what no longer serves the business while protecting the talent and programs that will drive its next chapter. This moment demands precision. To survive the cycle, yes, but also to know where \u2013 and who \u2013 to invest in, to create the conditions for future growth.\n\nScaling back on programs that aren\u2019t working can be healthy, but it carries real risk if done without first getting clarity on what is working.\n\nFor example, RedThread Research a trend of performance management programs being trimmed back. Support for managers is also thinning out, they note. Many employee experience efforts are narrowing in scope, or disappearing altogether, unless those programs and tools can be tied directly to business imperatives.\n\nIn isolation, these moves may seem pragmatic, and some may be. But taken together, they signal a shift worth watching. Because there\u2019s no question that giving up on your employees\u2019 well-being invites them to give up on yours.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this outside of tech, too. through the 2008\u201309 recession \u2014 avoiding layoffs while maintaining wages and benefits \u2014 and emerged with fierce employee and customer loyalty and stronger performance. And in 2020, and early retirements to avoid involuntary furloughs for key frontline groups, a deliberate choice to protect culture in the hardest moment. Both moves looked \u2018expensive\u2019 in the short term and paid dividends in the recovery.\n\nIn the research mentioned above, RedThread found that only 44% of employees are satisfied with their current performance management experience, and just 39% said they feel the process is fair. That\u2019s a signal of eroding trust. And as Stacia Garr noted, the push for productivity hasn\u2019t resulted in better outcomes. Instead, those companies may be trading their long-term health for short-term gains.\n\nThe trust gap is growing elsewhere, too. has found that while most employees believe their leaders are competent, only 56% believe those same leaders will prioritize well-being over short-term gains. That kind of perception shift can be hard to repair.\n\nI don\u2019t think most leaders are trying to undermine their own long-term people strategy. However, without a deeper understanding of contribution, influence, and burnout, it's far too easy to overlook what\u2019s quietly keeping the engine running.\n\nThe Signal Leaders Are Searching For\n\nIn every conversation I\u2019ve had with leaders lately, this one theme keeps coming up: they want to protect what matters. They can\u2019t fund everything. But they also know the cost of cutting programs that quietly hold the culture together.\n\nThe challenge is knowing where to focus.\n\nMost traditional people strategies are designed to scale broadly, rolling out the same solution to everyone in the name of consistency or fairness. But in constrained environments, generalizing is expensive. It misses the mark. And it can inadvertently end up being unfair to your best performers.\n\nLeaders don\u2019t want to guess. They want to target. To retain the people who elevate those around them. To develop the ones with headroom to grow. And to solve for skills gaps by building, not just buying, by looking inward at where capabilities already exist but may be hidden, untapped, or underrecognized.\n\nThey want to know:\n\u2022 Which managers are most in need of support, rather than just those who say they need it?\n\u2022 Where high-potential talent is emerging\u2014and what kind of support do they need to grow?\n\u2022 How to align efforts in recognition, learning, and DEI with what\u2019s truly happening on the ground?\n\nThis moment calls less for sharper scissors than sharper signals: clearer ways to understand who\u2019s making the biggest impact, where collaboration is strongest, and where potential is being underutilized. And just as important, it calls for better ways to spot risk early, before a critical contributor burns out, or a high-potential team starts to drift.\n\nThe old metrics don\u2019t help much. They\u2019re lagging, fragmented, and often shaped by hierarchy more than behavior. What\u2019s needed is a way to see the real patterns of work \u2013 who\u2019s trusted, who\u2019s stepping up, and who\u2019s quietly keeping the whole thing moving.\n\nThis Isn\u2019t Playing Favorites. It\u2019s Seeing Clearly.\n\nThere\u2019s understandable hesitation when it comes to targeting investments in people. Leaders worry about fairness, about optics, about creating two-tier systems. But the answer to that discomfort isn\u2019t to flatten everything. It\u2019s to raise the standard for what programs should do.\n\nIf a program is going to survive this moment, it needs to do more than sound good on paper. It needs to perform on two fronts.\n\u2022 Does it calibrate investment to impact? The best people programs should disproportionately benefit the individuals who are driving the business forward\u2014those who elevate others, deliver results, and embody what the organization is striving to become. That\u2019s not favoritism. That\u2019s precision.\n\u2022 Does it bring insight back into the business? The strongest programs don\u2019t just support employees. They deliver people intelligence. They help leaders understand where work is really happening, how aligned people are with values and priorities, what strengths exist across the organization and where energy is building or fading.\n\nWhen we hold programs to this standard, the path forward gets clearer. Instead of just spending less, you\u2019re also spending better and more discriminately.\n\nIn an uncertain environment where every choice carries more weight, leaders need more than instinct. They need insight that is grounded in behavior, connected to contribution, and current enough to act on.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean building something entirely new. Often, the signals already exist inside your business: recognition, collaboration, and peer feedback. What may appear on the surface as culture initiatives are, in reality, some of the richest data sources you have. They reveal who\u2019s driving momentum, who\u2019s aligned with strategy, and where leadership is quietly emerging.\n\nThat\u2019s why companies like Cisco continued to fund recognition at about 1% of payroll , even during a significant transformation\u2014using a global, peer-to-peer program to strengthen connection and, crucially, generate the data leaders needed to better navigate change.\n\nAnd yet, the irony is that these are often the very programs under threat. When budgets tighten, employee experience can be first on the list of cuts. But removing them means losing access to the signals that tell you where your people are creating value, where risk is rising, and where investment will return. In a world where technology levels the playing field, your people are the differentiator. And these programs hold the data that help you see that asset clearly.\n\nThe more closely I look at where organizations are thriving today, the more I\u2019m convinced that this kind of real-time, people-centered understanding will become the essential operating system of future workforce management and smart leadership decisions. Not for monitoring, but for matching investment to value. For making people decisions that are not only efficient, but funnel finite budget resources to where they will have the most impact.\n\nThat\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about the future of people investment. Not as a cost to manage, but as a portfolio to tune. After all, the goal isn\u2019t to do more with less. It\u2019s to do the right things with what you have.",

      "text": "FOREWORD\nThe world isn\u2019t black and white \u2014 but this report is. It shows in clear terms how CEOs are capitalizing on a moment of extraordinary ambiguity in the business world. Instead of hunkering down and playing it safe, chief executives are boldly leading their organizations through a new era of economic nationalism, making investment decisions in a time of elevated volatility, and adapting to accelerating technological change from artificial intelligence.\nFor the second consecutive year, the New York Stock Exchange and the Oliver Wyman Forum teamed up to see how CEOs are thinking about and responding to the challenges they face. Over the course of a month ending in early April, we surveyed 165 CEOs of companies whose shares are listed on the NYSE on topics ranging from managing geopolitical instability and supply chain disruption to capturing value from AI investments and optimizing workforce culture.\nSeveral clear takeaways emerged. CEOs are prioritizing growth more than last year even as they exercise tighter discipline over cost. They are spending more time planning for short-term horizons of less than a year while still seeking to position their companies for long-term success. And they are placing more emphasis on attracting talent and improving workforce skills even as a majority of CEOs report tangible financial gains from AI \u2014 including a significant minority that are already seeing sizeable cost savings or revenue gains from the technology.\nIn the pages that follow, we delve into the results to show how CEOs are leading their companies through this unpredictable period, and how some attitudes change depending on industry sectors or company size. We hope you\u2019ll find the results as illuminating \u2014 and clarifying \u2014 as we do.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSome turning points in history are gradual and appear only in hindsight. Others are abrupt and are felt in real time. Today\u2019s situation appears to be more like the latter.\nA new mood is sweeping across global markets as four decades of free-market orthodoxy gives way to a modern version of 1930s-style economic nationalism tinged with 18th century mercantilism. It isn\u2019t clear how the renewed embrace of tariffs and trade barriers in the Trump 2.0 era will play out over the long term, but the short-term transition has been challenging for CEOs, with supply chain hiccups, market volatility, and growing evidence of a slowdown in the United States this year.\nOn its own this policy upheaval might be navigable, but it coincides with another secular trend that promises to reshape industries, markets, and the workforce of the future: the acceleration of artificial intelligence. This double whammy is unlike anything most chief executives have experienced in their lifetimes.\nLeaders can\u2019t afford to wait for perfect clarity on these changes in the business environment. The seeds of tomorrow\u2019s growth are being planted today. The main task of CEOs in 2025 is to recalibrate short-term operating levers to pursue long-term opportunities. It requires not only dexterity but also the confidence to make bold decisions. Those who strike the right balance will create the conditions for enduring growth and success.\nIt\u2019s still early, but many seem to be on the right path.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nWHAT CEOs ARE PRIORITIZING\nBetting big on growth, funded by cost discipline\nNotwithstanding today\u2019s economic uncertainty, business leaders are still all in on growth. Sixty-eight percent of CEOs of New York Stock Exchange-listed companies surveyed in March and April cited a growth driver as their No. 1 priority, up from 56% in last year\u2019s survey.\nFinancial discipline is also important as the attention to cost is freeing up funding for growth bets. More than two-thirds of survey respondents (70%) cited cost management as one of their top three priorities for the next two years, up from 39% in our 2024 survey. But just 15% named this their top priority.\nTheir favorite strategy is revenue uplift through pricing, customer loyalty, and other drivers, named as the No. 1 priority by 36% of CEOs, well ahead of other options. An overwhelming majority of CEOs (95%) also plan mergers and acquisitions in the next one to two years, with 15% citing dealmaking as their top priority, up from 9% in 2024. By comparison, 17% of CEOs cited organic investment in new revenue streams as their No. 1 priority, down from 29% last year.\nTo drive this agenda, boards of directors are also rolling up their sleeves. More than half of CEOs (55%) reported increased board involvement in strategy and governance. Some 53% of boards are more involved in executive performance and succession, while 69% of CEOs are intensifying succession planning efforts.\nGeopolitics comes first \u2014 for now\nTrade and geopolitics are driving CEO decision-making first and foremost. Not surprisingly, most CEOs \u2014 84%, up from 78% last year \u2014 said they are doing more to address geopolitical risks, with just over half citing measures to de-risk their supply chains, a process that began during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeopolitical risks have intensified during the past decade, from the supply chain disruptions of the pandemic to the rise of industrial policies, trade barriers, and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. But despite the general drift toward economic nationalism in recent years, few CEOs anticipated the scale of the tariff and trade shocks of 2025. In all, 89% of CEOs rated geopolitics, trade policies, tariffs, and industrial policy as a risk to their company, up 20 percentage points from 2024.\nStill, most CEOs intend to diversify their existing multinational operating model rather than fundamentally redesign or abandon it. Fifty-two percent of CEOs plan to diversify their supply chains and 34% of CEOs plan to expand geographically through M&A over the next year or two, while only 13% intend to reshore some operations domestically.\nAI Leaders are pulling further ahead\nWhile macroeconomic issues are dominating both news reports and short-term results, the AI revolution is in full swing. Most leaders recognize this, with 95% of CEOs saying they regard the technology as an opportunity for their company, and increasingly they have the data to back up that belief.\nA new class of AI leaders is emerging, with 17% of CEOs saying the technology is already producing cost or revenue improvements of more than 10%. These leaders are much more likely than other CEOs to invest in long-term business transformation and reinvention, and to target mergers as a way of acquiring new capabilities and know-how.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, 41% of CEOs say it\u2019s too early to tell what the return on investment has been. Overall, three out of five reported getting some impact (1% or more) from AI. The direction of travel is clear: 71% of CEOs see the main risk of AI as not doing enough.\nWorkforce takes center stage\nAs the AI revolution gathers momentum, one main (and related) pillar of the modern corporation is undergoing massive change: the workforce. Over time, the changes wrought by AI and the evolving workforce could dwarf the importance of any dislocations resulting from shifting trade dynamics.\nCEOs in 2024 prioritized the timeworn imperatives of breaking down silos and empowering managers. This year they are focused more on the opportunity to develop a workforce that can get the most out of new technologies. Three-quarters of CEOs see talent attraction, retention, and workforce development as an opportunity for their business over the next three years, up from 50% in 2024.\nChief executives also cited workforce and culture as one of the biggest opportunities for success over the next five to 10 years \u2014 trailing only technology and financial strength as an important long-term factor.\nLeaders acknowledge that unleashing that potential requires a strong focus on training. Some 87% of CEOs said they plan to boost or change their current workers\u2019 skills over the next two years. CEOs are nearly four times as likely to use technology to boost worker productivity as to replace workers, with 77% of CEOs focused on enhancing productivity. CEOs also have views on who to keep by seniority: 36% expect to have a relatively more junior workforce over the next two years, compared with only 11% who plan to have more middle management positions.\nThe Outlook\n\u201cPredicting the future can only get you into trouble,\u201d the management guru Peter Drucker wrote. \u201cThe task is to manage what is there and to work to create what could and should be.\u201d\nDrucker penned that line in 1980 as the industrial world was reeling from stagflation and the neoliberal free-market order spawned by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had yet to take shape. CEOs are taking Drucker\u2019s advice to heart today as they face a potential seismic shift in the world economic order. They are combining big bets on growth with commercial discipline to create a brighter future. Waiting around for better conditions to arrive might only invite trouble.\nGROW / CUT\nHow CEOs are chasing growth amid turbulence\nEconomic uncertainty surged this year to levels not seen since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, as tariff threats and retaliation have elevated geopolitical risk and cast doubt on the prospects for growth. The shift in the policy environment may signal a definitive break from the consensus around promoting open trade that had prevailed for nearly four decades.\nCEOs are paid to deliver, and they\u2019ve been stress-tested in recent years by supply chain disruption, surging inflation, workforce turnover, and technological upheaval. So it\u2019s not surprising that this year more CEOs of NYSE\u2011listed companies are making growth their top priority, employing strategies tailored to these uncertain times. They are leaning into M&A, which can add scale and new customers in the short term, even as they dial back on organic investment in new revenue streams that can take years to bear fruit. At the same time, they are aiming to get a tighter grip on costs.\nThe signal corporate leaders are sending is clear: At a time of high uncertainty, control what you can but remain ambitious.\nFunding and scaling growth through commercial discipline\nCEOs are looking to manage through today\u2019s volatility, not use it as an excuse. Fully 68% of CEOs cited a growth driver as their No. 1 priority for increasing shareholder value in the next one to two years, up from 56% in 2024, while 32% named a value driver, down from 44%. The growth drivers they are targeting are revenue uplift, acquisitions, and organic investment, as opposed to value drivers such as cost control and capital efficiency.\nTo unlock funding for growth, CEOs are placing a much bigger emphasis this year on cutting costs. Among their top three priorities, 70% of CEOs of NYSE-listed companies cited cost management and operational excellence, more than any other issue and up from 39% in last year\u2019s survey. Yet cost was the top\u2011ranked priority of only 15% of CEOs.\nIn other words, cost cannot be ignored this year, but that is in the service of bigger priorities. This message is consistent with our conversations with other C-suite executives, which indicate that cost-cutting efforts are focusing mainly on streamlining operations and adopting technology to address competitive and macroeconomic pressures, benefit from technological advances, and free up capacity to invest in growth bets.\nThe breakdown of growth priorities is also instructive. More than three in five CEOs (62%) ranked revenue uplift through pricing, customer loyalty, and other drivers among their top three priorities, a close second to cost control. Notably, 36% named revenue uplift as their No. 1 priority, far ahead of any other lever and up from 18% a year ago. Acquisitions and partnerships also sit high on the agenda, with half of CEOs making that a top three priority and 15% placing it No. 1, up from 9% in 2024.\nBy contrast, corporate leaders are placing less emphasis on organic investment in new revenue streams, which is typically longer term in nature. This is a top three priority for 43% of CEOs, down from 55% a year ago, while 17% cited it as their No. 1 choice, down from 29% a year ago.\nCEOs also are putting much less emphasis on capital efficiency and cashflow management, with only 34% citing that value driver as a top three priority, down from 55% last year. This suggests leaders are relatively comfortable after two consecutive years of rising corporate earnings and free cashflow.\nLet's make a deal\nDeals are very much in the zeitgeist \u2014 nearly all CEOs are pursuing them despite market volatility. In a world where growth is neither easy nor quick, M&A can be a powerful lever, enabling CEOs to accelerate revenue growth, explore opportunities amid the volatility, and make a mark while delivering value for shareholders.\nFully 95% of survey respondents said they are planning for M&A in the next year or two. That\u2019s a notable figure considering that only 36% of NYSE-listed companies actually conducted an M&A transaction from 2023 to 2024 and the survey data were collected at the height of market volatility in March and early April.\nThe current motivation to do deals tends to be cautious and targeted, with 59% of CEOs pursuing industry consolidation while just 6% are aiming to make bold cross-sector plays. That\u2019s understandable at a time when market and policy conditions can change abruptly from day to day. Whether the planned deals reach completion also depends in part on the level of uncertainty \u2014 deals usually require conviction about likely profits over at least the next two years.\nShort horizons and growing board involvement\nAnother consequence of uncertainty and volatility is short-term planning. Surveyed CEOs dedicate 43% of their planning efforts to time horizons of less than one year, compared with 19% for the next five years and only 7% focusing seven or more years ahead.\nThat\u2019s consistent with Mercer\u2019s 2025 executive outlook data, in which four out of five executives said they struggle to balance long-term strategic planning with short-term operational needs. Short-term thinking also is consistent with the increasingly abbreviated nature of CEO tenures. A record number of fresh CEOs are in seat in 2025 \u2014 yet another reason the appetite for M&A is high, as our research finds that CEOs do 76% more deals in the first two years of their tenure than in their last two years.\nCEOs are facing heightened scrutiny from boards demanding decisive action and results, and from shareholder activists holding their feet to the fire. Research by Barclays shows that a record 27 CEOs of large global public companies targeted by activist investors resigned last year, almost three times as many as in 2020.\nTimes of uncertainty and risk demand greater vigilance all around, and boards are stepping up before crises and shareholder activism force their hand. Some 53% of CEOs reported increased board involvement in executive performance and succession, and 55% see boards getting more involved in traditional focus areas such as strategy and governance. Even operations \u2014 an area typically outside of the board\u2019s mandate \u2014 had a net increase in board involvement. After decades of research and commentary suggesting boards were not providing enough thoughtful oversight, most boards are rolling up their sleeves to meet the moment.\nHEDGE HERE / BET THERE\nManaging economic nationalism, supply chains, and other risks\nGeopolitical disruptions to businesses have proliferated in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic put supply chain resilience on the agenda of virtually every CEO and increased inflation and interest rates around the world. Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine sent global oil and grain prices climbing and natural gas prices soaring for European countries.\nBut few companies were prepared for the scale of geoeconomic shocks playing out in 2025. CEOs of NYSE-listed companies began the year in a confident mood, with markets at or near record levels in much of the world. Facing softening economic sentiment and the prospect of significantly higher import duties, markets are now much more volatile.\nThese events heightened CEO awareness of geopolitical risk and the need to take action to mitigate it. Nearly nine in 10 CEOs cited geopolitics, trade policies, tariffs, and industrial policy as a risk to their business. That\u2019s up 20 percentage points from 2024 \u2014 the biggest jump of any risk factor in the survey.\nCEOs can\u2019t dictate the macro environment, but they are using the levers at their disposal to mitigate risk and gain competitive advantage. Eighty-four percent of CEOs are addressing geopolitical and supply chain shocks, up from 78% last year. Notably, small companies (defined as those with annual revenue of less than $1 billion) have had the biggest wake-up call, with 71% taking new steps to address geopolitical instability, up from 60% in 2024.\nEvolution, not revolution\nThe disruptions of the pandemic prompted many companies to reconsider supply chains built to maximize efficiency and instead increase their resilience. These efforts overlapped with the growing adoption of so-called China+1 strategies to reduce dependence on the world\u2019s largest manufacturer, with many companies increasing investment in manufacturing hubs in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.\nSupply chain de-risking is the leading response to geopolitical shocks this year, cited by 52% of CEOs. Retail and consumer goods companies are the most active de-riskers, with 78% of CEOs taking action, followed by healthcare and life sciences (71%) and industrials (70%).\nSuch efforts seem to represent continuity of approach rather than a fundamental change. CEOs are adapting their global footprint rather than remaking it for a new economic order \u2014 perhaps due to uncertainty about what the new order will be. Just over a third of survey respondents (34%) are planning geographic expansion through M&A in the next one to two years. By contrast, only 13% plan to reshore some operations domestically, down from 16% in 2024, while only 10% are delaying international strategy and investment decisions.\nWhile US companies on the whole have not been eager to bring operations onshore, non-US companies have been expanding their US presence, with foreign direct investment (FDI) into the US surging in 2024. There are also pockets of stronger reshoring by sector; healthcare and life sciences lead the way, with 29% of CEOs planning to bring some operations back to their domestic market. Between February and April 2025, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, and Novartis each announced tens of billions of dollars in investment into US manufacturing over the coming four to five years. A similar proportion of transportation and automotive CEOs (27%) plan to reshore, though their investment timelines are also spread over five or more years.\nAlso notably de-emphasized in the supply chain agenda is sustainability and decarbonization. Although 57% of CEOs see this as a risk to their business, and 27% of companies experienced supply chain disruptions in 2024 due to weather and natural disasters (according to the Business Continuity Institute, a professional group), fewer than one in 10 North American CEOs view sustainability as a top three factor impacting their long-term business competitiveness.\nIt remains to be seen whether companies will consider more aggressive de-risking strategies in the future. Policy uncertainty in the run-up to last year\u2019s presidential election may have played a role in cooling US manufacturing investment, which was flat in the second half of 2024 after more than doubling over the previous three and a half years. But the environment could change significantly in the months ahead. The combined set of active and announced US tariffs could potentially have a steep impact in countries such as Vietnam, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mexico, which have been among the big beneficiaries of supply chain realignment to date.\nTurning vulnerability to opportunity\nCEOs who are getting out on the front foot are feeling the benefits. Two-thirds of CEOs see supply chain realignment as an opportunity for their business rather than a risk, up from 56% a year ago.\nThe survey underscores other ways in which business adaptation to an uncertain environment is maturing. Nearly half of CEOs are developing or strengthening the governance of their business continuity and crisis management planning, compared with two-thirds in 2024. And 34% plan to deepen visibility into their supply chains beyond their direct suppliers. That\u2019s vital considering that nearly two-thirds of companies face supply chain bottlenecks when looking at Tier 2 and 3 suppliers, according to Sentrisk, a global supply chain tracker from Marsh McLennan.\nOne policy area where CEOs see some improvement is regulation. The majority still see government intervention as a risk rather than an opportunity, but the balance is shifting: 32% see regulation as an opportunity for their business, up from 15% a year ago. Financial services companies are among the most optimistic on this; 39% see more regulatory opportunities than risks.\nGO BIG / START SMALL\nDelivering on AI\u2019s promise\nIn a world brimming with uncertainty, there\u2019s one thing that nearly every business leader continues to see as an opportunity to exploit: the power of AI.\nNinety-five percent of the NYSE-listed CEOs we surveyed consider AI as an opportunity for their business, not a risk. That\u2019s essentially unchanged from 2024. What is new, though, is that opinions on AI\u2019s importance increasingly are the product of experience rather than hope. More companies are investing in AI across a wider variety of use cases, and a majority are already experiencing cost savings or revenue impacts, some of them substantial.\nThat reflects an impressive degree of rapid AI adoption that includes and goes far beyond the generative AI tools that gained the spotlight only two and a half years ago. But the competitive playing field is anything but level. As more companies embed AI into more areas of their business, a gap is growing between AI leaders and laggards, with 17% of CEOs reporting an improvement of more than 10% in their company\u2019s total cost savings or revenue generation due to AI. Large companies are in the vanguard of this leading group, with 24% reporting outsized improvement in operating results compared with 13% of small and medium-sized companies.\nFifty-three percent of survey respondents said a lack of proven and feasible use cases was among the biggest AI-related risks to their business, and a similar percentage cited the difficulty of governing and controlling AI-related risks such as cybersecurity, data protection, and inaccurate or biased output. But fewer companies are delaying investment in AI. And two out of five CEOs said one of their biggest AI risks is not moving fast enough and being left behind, virtually unchanged from a year ago.\nAll this suggests there is still plenty to play for in this space.\nProving AI's importance with tangible results\nBelief in AI drove an investment boom; according to capital markets tracker PitchBook, global investment in generative AI exceeded $56 billion in 2024, nearly double the $29 billion of 2023. Over the past few years especially, excitement has intensified over AI\u2019s potential to enhance human capabilities, generate new discoveries, and accelerate productivity. The evidence of AI\u2019s impact is becoming hard to ignore: Today, 60% of CEOs already see some quantified impact (at least 1% of their company\u2019s overall cost savings or revenue growth).\nSome CEOs are pulling away from the pack on the cost side, with those of large firms leading the way. Twenty-three percent of the leaders of large companies attribute more than 10% of their cost savings to AI, more than three times the share of CEOs of small and medium-sized companies (7%). By contrast, revenue generation does not vary significantly by size, with about 8% of CEOs attributing more than 10% of revenue to AI, including 5% who report revenue gains of more than 20%.\nNumbers like those can overcome AI skepticism and potentially reshape industries. For 38% of CEOs, the return on AI investment meets or exceeds expectations, more than six times as many as the leaders who say returns have disappointed.\nThese early returns on AI are also shaping corporate attitudes in a more fundamental way. Nearly half of all CEOs (49%) said technology and AI will be among the top three drivers of competitiveness the next five to 10 years, ahead of financial strength (44%) and workforce and culture (42%). Large companies feel this the most, with 55% of CEOs citing tech and AI as among the three biggest competitiveness drivers, while 41% of bosses of small and medium-sized companies share this assessment.\nPerhaps just as important, long-term gains don\u2019t have to incur short-term pain. Nearly a third of CEOs \u2014 and 39% of large company bosses \u2014 say technology and AI are among their top factors for immediate value creation.\nCEOs are also shifting where they use AI, aiming to unlock efficiency to transform their businesses. On average, 83% of the bosses we surveyed are investing heavily or incrementally in AI across major categories of use cases (up modestly from 79% a year ago), from operational efficiency and insight generation to new revenue growth. Among the more notable increases, 84% are investing in customer service automation, up from 71% a year ago, while investment in AI to generate new revenue streams increased by eight percentage points, to 66%. Small companies feel they are falling behind: 45% of small company CEOs cited FOMO, or fear of missing out, as one of their leading AI risks, up from 31% in 2024.\nWhat the leaders tell us\nLeading AI companies stand out in a few ways. CEOs of AI leaders are more than three times as likely as other CEOs to be investing in long-term business transformation and reinvention (32% versus 9%), and nearly twice as likely to use mergers as a means of acquiring new capabilities and intellectual property (61% to 34%).\nThey also are more likely to be planning a reduction in their workforce, with 46% of CEOs saying this, compared with 34% of other chief executives. Yet CEOs of AI leaders are much more likely to focus on hiring middle and senior management, with 35% citing this as opposed to 14% of other CEOs.\nAI leaders are most likely to be found among communications, media, and technology companies, with 56% of survey respondents from that sector reporting strong improvements in cost savings or revenue generation. Healthcare and life sciences (24%), financials (19%), and retail and consumer goods (13%) also stand out as leaders. Scale plays a significant role in being able to deliver financial gains, with 24% of large company CEOs qualifying as leaders, compared with 13% of small and medium-sized companies.\nContinuing risks and workforce issues\nThe moderation of the AI investment boom and evolving attitudes suggest a growing awareness that AI success depends as much on humans as technology. Last year was defined by AI FOMO among CEOs, but this year that did not make it into their top three AI concerns. Workforce readiness replaced it.\nLimited workforce readiness, including skills, adoption, and morale, is the biggest AI worry of CEOs, with 55% citing it among their top three concerns. By comparison, 53% of CEOs cited the difficulty of governing and controlling AI-related risks such as data protection, cybersecurity, and biases, and a similar percentage cited too few proven and feasible use cases.\nThe findings suggest a continuing perception gap between corporate leaders and rank-and-file workers. Fully 71% of US employees are using AI in their work (often using consumer-facing rather than internal tools), according to the Oliver Wyman Forum\u2019s latest quarterly survey of consumers. By contrast, only 33% of employees say the technology tools introduced so far by their companies are clearly useful, and only 16% of employees say their companies are investing very well in AI capabilities.\nTRAIN / REPLACE\nBetting on talent and culture\nThe rise of AI has caused anxiety about job security and the potential for increasing unemployment in the future. Yet the biggest mover among all of the opportunities today\u2019s CEOs see for their business revolves around their people.\nTo be clear, accelerating artificial intelligence remains the overwhelming priority for business leaders, with 95% of NYSE CEOs we surveyed citing it as an opportunity for their company, not a risk. But it takes talented employees to get the most value out of AI, just as smartly deployed AI can enhance those human skills and make workers more productive.\nThat helps explain why 75% of CEOs cite talent attraction, retention, and workforce development as an opportunity for their business over the next three years \u2014 up 25 percentage points from 2024 and the biggest increase in perceived opportunity in this year\u2019s survey. In addition, 42% percent of CEOs regard workforce and culture as an opportunity over the next five to 10 years, trailing only technology and AI (49%) and financial strength and flexibility (44%), and surpassing other critical factors such as M&A, market expansion, and operations. This year marked the first time we asked leaders to rank their long-term opportunities.\nThe fact that just a quarter of CEOs see talent issues as a risk for their business suggests a possible blind spot. Consider that only 14% of employees said they were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their company\u2019s senior leadership, according to the Oliver Wyman Forum\u2019s Global Consumer Sentiment Survey. Nonetheless, amid a cooling job market and a growing range of productivity use cases with AI, CEOs are also justified in emphasizing the opportunities in their talent strategies.\nFocusing on skills and productivity\nEmployer-employee relations have undergone some seismic shifts in recent years. Companies responded to the pandemic by furloughing or firing millions of workers, only to scramble to staff up as economies reopened. Workers used their newfound power to demand higher wages and a better work-life balance. After the past three years of effectively full employment, the pendulum is swinging back in favor of CEOs and their hiring managers, with the rate of job-quitting falling back to pre-pandemic norms and salary increases from job hopping also declining.\nToday the rapid introduction of AI into the workplace creates a new dynamic, raising fundamental questions about the nature of work and the range of skills that will be needed. Goodbye to writing code, hello to software prompting and problem-solving?\nLeaders are focusing training efforts in this new environment. Four out of five CEOs plan to invest in raising workforce skills in the next two years, while 77% plan to invest in technology to enhance workforce productivity. By contrast, only one in five CEOs expects to replace workers with technology. Large companies are most likely to consider doing so, with 25% of those CEOs saying they plan to replace workers with AI. Perhaps not surprisingly, US employees are questioning whether they are getting enough support: 42% believe their company is not going far enough in preparing them for long-term success.\nGetting staffing and seniority right\nAttitudes toward staff levels vary with corporate strategies. Leaders making growth their top priority are less likely to plan to reduce headcount (27% versus 36% of survey respondents overall), while 52% of value-oriented leaders expect to trim headcount.\nBy comparison, AI leaders \u2014 the companies already generating more than 10% of company-wide cost savings or revenue gains from the technology \u2014 are more likely than other survey respondents to plan to reduce the number of employees by more than 5%. Forty-six percent of AI leaders expect to make such cuts, compared with 34% of other CEOs.\nIndustries where workforce reduction plans are most common are led by transportation and automotive, where 64% of CEOs expect to reduce headcount by more than 5% in the next year or two, and health and life sciences, at 53%. By comparison, 67% of CEOs in the real estate sector plan to increase headcount by more than 5% over the next two years, ahead of communications, media, and technology (53%) and industrials (45%).\nAI acceleration coincides with major demographic shifts. Four generations make up the vast bulk of the US workforce, but baby boomers \u2014 the youngest of whom turn 61 this year \u2014 continue to retire in large numbers. They are now outnumbered in the labor force by Gen Zers, the oldest of whom turn 28 this year.\nFor many companies, AI can be a useful tool to manage the transition, enabling younger workers to rapidly boost their productivity. Our survey finds support for this. Thirty-six percent of CEOs expect to have more junior positions in their workforce over the next two years, compared with 11% who plan to have more middle management positions and 6% planning for relatively more senior positions. This finding corresponds with recent experience, with middle management accounting for nearly a third of white-collar layoffs in the United States in 2023, compared with 20% just before the pandemic, according to workforce tracker Live Data Technologies.\nYet 35% of CEOs who are AI leaders plan to have more middle managers and senior executives over the next two years, compared with just 14% for other CEOs in the survey. This suggests that AI leaders may be more open to replacing junior employees with AI and less open to losing managers, who might be better positioned to judge the quality of AI outputs.\nThumbs up on return to office and diversity\nWith pandemic turmoil receding and executives seeing less medium-term risk in talent attraction and retention, CEOs are continuing to prioritize in-person collaboration. Fully 58% of survey respondents say they plan to further intensify return-to-office policies over the next two years, while 41% plan no change. CEOs are betting this will improve productivity, but the aggregate impact on workers and the economies could be nuanced. Slowing population growth creates pressure to increase labor force participation, and decreasing flexibility could eventually cut against that goal. For example, remote and hybrid work options helped bring 2 million more employees with disabilities into the US workforce, representing a 35% rise in this group\u2019s labor force participation from pre-pandemic levels.\nThe survey also found significant support for diversity in the workplace, notwithstanding the marked shift in the political climates on diversity in several countries and the recent decrease in formal corporate programs around the issue. Even as boards become less involved in these efforts, three-quarters of CEOs say they plan no change to the level of workforce diversity in the next two years, while one-quarter expect to increase diversity. By contrast, not a single CEO out of 165 respondents plans to reduce workforce diversity.\nThe rise of AI has shifted CEOs\u2019 focus this year to the immense opportunities presented by their workforces. CEOs are investing in the human skills that unlock the value of technological advancements. However, views among employees suggest that upskilling, retraining, and enterprise productivity tools have significant room to improve and expand. We might look back one year from now and say: We were just getting started.\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nThe Oliver Wyman Forum conducted a CEO survey in collaboration with the New York Stock Exchange between March 8 and April 7, 2025. The survey was taken by 165 CEOs of NYSE-listed companies.\nThe survey results are presented as unweighted given the valuable insight of each CEO and hard-to-reach audience. Percentages displayed in exhibits may not sum to 100% due to rounding. The survey was split across topics that are salient for many businesses globally, such as strategy and priorities, managing geopolitical and supply chain volatility, capturing value from AI investments, and optimizing talent and culture. While the insights from the survey are largely agnostic to sector and company size, there were specific cases in which it was important to differentiate between the industry and size of the company. For these statements we have used a base size of 30 CEO respondents per industry and size category, and in cases in which this has not been reached, we treated the findings as directional only.\nIn addition to the CEO survey data, we used the Oliver Wyman Forum\u2019s 2025 quarterly employee and consumer general population survey of more than 16,000 people across 17 nations \u2014 the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, India, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, China (Hong Kong), Indonesia, Singapore, Australia, South Africa, Canada, and the United States \u2014 as of March and April 2025. We used a global sample because a significant portion of the companies listed on NYSE are global in their commercial footprint. That survey was sourced from a panel of 67 million people worldwide, and to ensure representative distributions our respondent pool generally mirrored the demographics of each country, including age, income, education level, political affiliation, and gender. The survey data is supplemented by other secondary research as well as interviews to understand qualitative sentiment. News sentiment data to inform the report narrative came from Factiva Sentiment Signals powered by Oliver Wyman.\nAcKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nAuthors\nAna Kreacic, John Romeo, Arran Yentob, Jose Lopez, and Vita Spivak.\nContributors\nPatrick Barlow, Laurent Bensoussan, Annabel Berney, Tom Buerkle, Rick Chavez, Larissa de Lima, Aaron Fine, Charlotte Fuller, Joshua Gilbert, Tim Hoyland, Robert Hunter, Dan Kleinman, Ugur Koyluoglu,Alankrita Lal, Helen Leis, Nick Liptak, Jilian Mincer, Ben Paik, Mark Pellerin, Rutger von Post, Mariya Rosberg, Til Schuermann, Vivek Sen, Sophie Sensi, Tom Stalnaker, and Heather Stern.\nArt and Design\nSimon Crofts, Ingrid De Leon, Yireli Pale, Cynthia Perez, and Ai Peng Thoo.\n(49%)\nand flexibility\n(44%)\n(42%)\nGeopolitics\nand industrial\npolicy\n(21%)\nand partnerships\n(32%)\nSustainability\nand decarbonization\n(9%)\nand supply chain\n(22%)\nand compliance\n(24%)\nand diversification\n(27%)\nOthers\n(1%)\nand brand\n(24%)\nCybersecurity\nand data protection\n(5%)"

      "text": "Cut the Chaos: Qualtrics Announces Top Employee Experience Trends for 2025\nEmployees are more engaged where the culture helps them adapt to change\nDespite their reputation, the youngest workers (18-24 years old) are most optimistic\nLast updated: October 17, 2024\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE, Oct. 17, 2024 \u2013 Today\u2019s employees would like to get back on task. Years of chaotic workplace changes \u2013 think hybrid working arrangements and tracking multiple projects across different platforms have employees yearning for a simpler, productive 9-to-5, according to the sixth annual Employee Experience Trends Report from Qualtrics, drawing on insights from more than 35,000 employees in 23 countries around the world,\nThe five employee experience trends for 2025 are:\n+ 2025\u2019s best employers will make work less chaotic: The pace of change is putting pressure on employees, and they need organizational support to stay engaged and maintain their well-being.\n+ Young employees are (surprisingly) optimistic\u2026for now: Workers under 25 years old are highly engaged and have a positive outlook on the success of their company as well as their own careers.\n+ Employee experiences are being ruined by entry and exit: Employees rank the application and interview process as the worst part of the employee journey, risking company reputations.\n+ Prioritizing short-term gains are costing you long-term trust: While most employees believe in the competence and integrity of their senior leaders, just 56% believe they would prioritize employee well-being above short-term gains.\n+ PSA: Your people are outpacing you on AI: Only about half of employees say they have training and ethical guidelines around using AI at work.\n2025\u2019s best employers will make work less chaotic\nAmid rapid change to the workplace, employees are more engaged when their employer\u2019s culture and processes empower them and make it easier to do their jobs. A culture of continuous improvement is the strongest predictor of employee well-being, yet it\u2019s trailing as one of the lowest rated metrics among global employees.\nNearly 40% of employees report feeling pressure to be more productive. The pressure primarily comes from trying to keep up with the pace of change, as well as the overall economic environment and strategic changes to the business. When employees feel pressure, they are less engaged and their well-being suffers.\nLeaders can ease this pressure by helping employees understand and adapt to changes \u2013 in fact, these are the top actions leaders can take to exceed employee expectations.\n\u201cOver the past several years, we\u2019ve seen that engagement and well-being are highest when employees feel proud of their organization\u2019s impact on customers and supported in adapting to change.\u201d said Dr. Benjamin Granger, Chief Workplace Psychologist at Qualtrics. \u201cIn general, humans are excellent at adapting to change, as long as they have support. Increased pressure to be productive must be met with increased organizational support and communication if organizations are to uphold their end of the new psychological contract between employee and employer.\u201d\nYoung employees are (surprisingly) optimistic\u2026for now\nWorkers under 25 are bringing highly engaged, optimistic energy to work. They want to drive change, and have an overall positive outlook on their company\u2019s future, as well as their own.\nBut don\u2019t count on them for the long run: The one metric where young workers trail older generations is their intent to stay with a company for three or more years, even when they feel their employer exceeds their expectations.\nSome of this could be due to typical demographic patterns. Young people may be more flexible about making major life changes more frequently. Still, leaders who want to retain this bright and valuable cohort can prioritize these things:\nTop drivers of intent to stay for employees 18-24 years old:\n+ My career goals can be met at this company\n+ Employee benefits meets my needs\n+ Manager behavior consistent with company values\n+ Believe in the company values\n+ Have meaningful career development discussions with my manager\n\u201cWhen leaders accept stereotypes about young employees being lazy, entitled, or disengaged, they do their organizations a disservice. Crushing the optimism young workers bring into the workplace is far from productive, especially when it can be easily nurtured, bringing out creativity and new ideas for innovation,\u201d according to Granger. \u201cOffering them opportunities to share their ideas and stretch their skills can win over talented workers early in their careers and create lasting goodwill toward the company, even after they eventually depart.\u201d\nEmployee experiences are being ruined by entry and exit\nEmployees who have been with their current company for less than six months don\u2019t plan to stay long-term. More than half of these new employees (56%) plan to leave within three years, compared with just 34% of more tenured workers. Why? Because companies are souring their new employees\u2019 morale before they even start by providing poor job candidate experience. In fact, the candidate experience is rated lowest among several significant phases in the employee journey, such as onboarding, changing roles or applying for a promotion.\nAt the other end of an employee\u2019s time with a company, the exit experience was also poor. While departed employees are no longer active with a company, their final impression can become the lens through which they view their entire experience.\n\u201cPotential and past employees are often overlooked when it comes to a company\u2019s reputation, and organizations take on unnecessary risk by neglecting to address these bookend experiences,\u201d said Granger. \u201cCandidates and former employees can still influence others\u2019 opinions about the company, good or bad. Organizations that invest in these first and final impressions gain a significant advantage in attracting talented candidates in the future, some of whom return to the company with enhanced skills and experiences.\u201d\nPrioritizing short-term gains are costing you long-term trust\nMore than two-thirds of employees believe their senior leaders are both competent and act consistently with the organization\u2019s values, but only 56% believe they will choose employee well-being over short-term gains.\nBusiness leaders are challenged by an uneven global economy and declining customer loyalty, but the long-term success of the company is at risk if they overlook the importance of employee trust.\n\u201cTrust is the glue that holds people within organizations together, but it is often harder to earn and maintain during times of disruption and uncertainty,\u201d said Granger. \u201cMost leaders are comfortable tracking operational metrics, but the ones who earn employee trust go further to monitor how employees feel, and double down on trust building-behavior and communication during challenging times.\u201d\nTrust is highly correlated with employee engagement, as well as employees\u2019 sense of inclusion and well-being. Employees who trust their leaders are more open to changes, receptive to communication and overall act in ways that ultimately benefit the organization.\nEmployees are more likely to trust their leaders when:\n+ Senior leadership responds to feedback from employees\n+ Senior leadership values diverse perspectives, even if different\n+ There is open and honest communication at this company\n+ Work processes allow employees to be as productive as possible\n+ Company continually improves how work gets done\nPSA: Your people are outpacing you on AI\nEmployees are outpacing their employers on AI adoption, as enablement lags. Nearly half of employees say their organizations don\u2019t provide AI enablement and training, and a similar share say their company has no clear AI guidelines, ethics or principles \u2013 or they are unaware they exist.\nMeanwhile, nearly a third of employees who use AI at work are using tools that they found themselves, as opposed to tools provided by the company, meaning they likely have not been approved by IT or security teams and may not have safeguards to protect company or customer data. Nearly half (45%) of employees say they are using AI daily or weekly, and employees who use AI regularly are more positive about its potential for their job than employees who rarely use it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing desire and readiness among workers to leverage AI, even if it isn\u2019t explicitly supported by the company,\u201d said Granger. \u201cThis introduces significant risks to employees, customers, and organizations alike. Many workers are already looking for opportunities to use AI to augment their work and it is far better for organizational leaders to lean in and provide approved tools and clear guidance to gain the benefits of these technologies without putting the company or customers at risk.\u201d\nFor the full report and methodology, click here.\nAbout Qualtrics\nQualtrics, the leader of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

      "text": "The Conference Board Measure of CEO Confidence\u2122 is a barometer of the health of the US economy from the perspective of US chief executives. The measure of CEO confidence is based on CEOs' perceptions of current and expected business and industry conditions. The survey also gauges CEOs' expectations about future actions their companies plan on taking in four key areas: capital spending, employment, recruiting, and wages.\nConfidence Revived in Q3 but CEOs Remain Cautious\nLatest Press Release\nUpdated: Thursday, August 7, 2025\nThe Conference Board Measure of CEO Confidence\u2122 in collaboration with The Business Council rose to 49 in Q3 2025, up 15 points from 34 in Q2. (A reading below 50 reflects more negative than positive responses.) A total of 122 CEOs participated in the Q3 survey, which was fielded from July 14 to 28.\n\u201cCEO confidence recovered in the third quarter after collapsing in Q2, but fell short of signaling a return to optimism,\u201d said Stephanie Guichard, Senior Economist, Global Indicators, The Conference Board. \u201cThe improvement is a continuation of the trend seen after tariff disputes between the US and China became less intense and potentially reflects ongoing progress on trade negotiations. All three components of the Measure improved from deep pessimism to near neutral. CEOs\u2019 views on current economic conditions made the sharpest recovery. Their six-month expectations for the economy as a whole and in their own industries also improved. CEOs\u2019 assessments of current conditions in their own industries\u2014a measure not included in calculating the topline Confidence measure\u2014also recovered but remained in pessimistic territory. Fear of recession within the next 12-18 months eased dramatically, to 36% in Q3 from 83% in Q2.\u201d\n\u201cNotably, trade and tariffs risks receded in Q3 to third place among the top business risks impacting CEOs\u2019 industries, below geopolitical instability and cyber risks,\u201d said Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., Vice Chairman of The Business Council and Chair Emeritus of The Conference Board. \u201cSlightly more CEOs reported some difficulty finding qualified workers than in previous quarters. Meanwhile, the share of CEOs expecting some reduction in the size of their workforce over the next 12 months rose for the fifth consecutive quarter, to 34%. For the first time since 2020, CEOs planning to shrink their workforce exceeded the share looking to expand (27%), though a plurality continued to anticipate little change (39%, down from 44%).\u201d\nFerguson continued: \u201cThe share of CEOs planning to raise wages by 3% or more over the next year ticked up to 61% from 58% in Q2. As in previous quarters, most CEOs indicated no revisions to their capital spending plans over the next 12 months. However, for a second consecutive quarter, the share of CEOs expecting to cut back investment plans was higher than the share expecting to upgrade them.\u201d\nAsked where they faced increasing cost pressures, most CEOs cited suppliers (71%), materials (64%), and technology (63%). Wages came in fourth at 47%. Regarding strategies to manage costs, CEOs overwhelmingly mentioned relying on technology to increase productivity (93%), negotiating with suppliers (89%), and upskilling their workforce (83%). These top strategies were followed by cuts in operating costs (73%) and pass-through to higher consumer prices (64%). Only 19% of CEOs planned to absorb higher costs in profit margins and very few planned to cut R&D.\nCurrent Conditions\nCEOs\u2019 assessment of general economic conditions partially rebounded in Q3 2025:\n- 34% of CEOs said economic conditions were worse than six months ago, down from 82% in Q2.\n- 22% said economic conditions were better, up significantly from 2%.\nCEOs\u2019 assessments of conditions in their own industries also improved in Q3:\n- 38% of CEOs said conditions in their own industries were worse than six months ago, down from 69% in Q2.\n- 18% said conditions in their industries were better, up from just 7%.\nFuture Conditions\nCEOs\u2019 expectations about the short-term economic outlook recovered to neutral in Q3:\n- 30% of CEOs expected economic conditions to worsen over the next six months, down from 64% in Q2.\n- 30% expected economic conditions to improve, up from 18%.\nCEOs\u2019 expectations for short-term prospects in their own industries became slightly optimistic in Q3:\n- 25% of CEOs expected conditions in their own industry to worsen over the next six months, down from 51%.\n- 30% expected conditions in their own industry to improve, up from 18% in Q2.\nEmployment, Recruiting, Wages, and Capital Spending\n- Employment: 34% of CEOs expected a net reduction in their workforce over the next 12 months, up from 28% in Q2. The share of CEOs planning to expand their workforce ticked down to 27% from 28%, while 39% of CEOs planned to maintain the size of their workforce, down from 44% last quarter.\n- Hiring Qualified People: Most CEOs continued to report no problemsinhiring overall, but the share of CEOs reporting trouble hiring in key areas rose.\n- Wages: Most CEOs (53%) planned to increase salaries by 3.0\u20133.9% over the next 12 months, unchanged from Q2.\n- Capital Spending: 21% of CEOs expected to revise spending plans downward, down from 26% in Q2. But the share of CEOs expecting to increase capital spending also shrunk\u2014to 15% in Q3 from 19% in Q2. Most CEOs (64%) indicated no plans to revise capital spending.\nUS Recession:\nThe share of CEOs expecting a recession fell to 36% in Q3 after a spike in Q2\nIndustry Risks:\nCEOs ranked geopolitical instability and cyber threats as top concerns for their industry, while concerns about trade and tariffs eased somewhat\nCost Pressures:\nMost CEOs report increased cost pressures from suppliers, as well as in materials and technology\nManaging Costs:\nCEOs cite productivity-enhancing technology, negotiations with suppliers, and upskilling as their top strategies for managing costs, but nearly two-thirds (64%) also expect to raise consumer prices\nAbout The Conference Board\nThe Conference Board is the member-driven think tank that delivers Trusted Insights for What\u2019s Ahead\u00ae.

      "text": "September quarter 2020 GAAP pre-tax loss of $6.9 billion and loss per share of $8.47 on total revenue of $3.1 billion\nSeptember quarter 2020 adjusted pre-tax loss of $2.6 billion and adjusted loss per share of $3.30 on adjusted revenue of $2.6 billion\nATLANTA, Oct. 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) today reported financial results for the September quarter 2020. Detailed results, including both GAAP and adjusted metrics, are on page four and are incorporated here.\n\"While our September quarter results demonstrate the magnitude of the pandemic on our business, we have been encouraged as more customers travel and we are seeing a path of progressive improvement in our revenues, financial results and daily cash burn,\" said Ed Bastian, Delta's chief executive officer. \"The actions we are taking now to take care of our people, simplify our fleet, improve the customer experience, and strengthen our brand will allow Delta to accelerate into a post-COVID recovery.\"\nSeptember Quarter Financial Results\n- Adjusted pre-tax loss of $2.6 billion excludes $4.0 billion of items directly related to the impact of COVID-19 and the company's response, including fleet-related restructuring charges and charges for voluntary separation and early retirement programs for Delta employees, which were partially offset by the benefit of the CARES Act grant recognized in the quarter\n- Total adjusted revenue of $2.6 billion declined 79 percent on 63 percent lower capacity versus prior year\n- Total operating expense, which includes the $4.0 billion of COVID-related items described above, decreased $1.0 billion over prior year. Adjusted for those items and third-party refinery sales, total operating expense decreased $5.5 billion or 52 percent in the September quarter compared to the prior year, driven by lower capacity- and revenue-related expenses and strong cost management in the business\n- At the end of the September quarter, the company had $21.6 billion in liquidity\n- During the September quarter cash burn (see Note A) averaged $24 million per day, and $18 million per day for the month of September\nRevenue Environment\nDelta's adjusted operating revenue of $2.6 billion for the September quarter was down 79 percent versus the September 2019 quarter as demand for air travel remains under significant pressure. Passenger revenues declined 83 percent on 63 percent lower capacity. Non-ticket revenue streams have performed relatively better than passenger revenues, with total loyalty revenues declining 60 percent and cargo declining 25 percent.\n\"With a slow and steady build in demand, we are restoring flying to meet our customers' needs, while staying nimble with our capacity in light of COVID-19,\" said Glen Hauenstein, Delta's president. \"While it may be two years or more until we see a normalized revenue environment, by restoring customer confidence in travel and building customer loyalty now, we are creating the foundation for sustainable future revenue growth.\"\nSetting the Foundation for Recovery\nDelta has taken a number of actions to position the company to accelerate into a post-COVID recovery:\nTaking great care of Delta people\n- Through the voluntary separation and early retirement programs, voluntary unpaid leaves, job sharing and other initiatives, the company has been able to avoid involuntary furloughs for ground and flight attendant employees\n- Launching a \"Stop the Spread. Save Lives.\" campaign to emphasize the six core health actions that protect Delta employees against COVID-19, including wearing masks, social distancing, testing and getting a flu shot. Delta is providing no-cost COVID-19 testing and flu shots for its U.S. employees\nImproving the customer experience\n- Emphasizing health and safety with the Delta CareStandard, a multi-layered approach that includes intense cleaning protocols, blocking middle seats and requiring masks onboard all aircraft\n- Reducing complexity for customers by eliminating change fees for nearly all domestic fares and redeposit/reissuance fees on domestic reward tickets for SkyMiles Members\n- Taking a customer-centric approach to refunds, with approximately $2.8 billion returned to customers year-to-date\nSimplifying the fleet\n- Restructuring its Airbus and CRJ aircraft order books to better match the timing of aircraft deliveries with network and financial needs over the next several years. The restructuring reduces aircraft purchase commitments by more than $2 billion in 2020 and by more than $5 billion through 2022\n- Accelerating its fleet simplification strategy, which is intended to modernize and streamline the company's fleet, enhance the customer experience and generate cost savings. The company has announced plans to accelerate retirements of nearly 400 aircraft by 2025, including more than 200 in 2020\n|\nFleet Type\n|\nNumber of Aircraft\n|\nEstimated Final Retirement During the Quarter Ended\n|\n|\nMD-90\n|\n26\n|\nJune 2020\n|\n|\n767-300ER\n|\n7\n|\nJune 2020\n|\n|\nA320\n|\n10\n|\nJune 2020\n|\n|\nMD-88\n|\n47\n|\nJune 2020\n|\n|\n737-700\n|\n10\n|\nSeptember 2020\n|\n|\n777\n|\n18\n|\nDecember 2020\n|\n|\nCRJ-200\n|\n125\n|\nDecember 2023\n|\n|\n717\n|\n91\n|\nDecember 2025\n|\n|\n767-300ER\n|\n49\n|\nDecember 2025\n|\n|\nTotal\n|\n383\n|\n|\nCost Performance\nTotal adjusted operating expense for the September quarter decreased $5.5 billion or 52 percent versus the prior year quarter excluding $3.1 billion in charges related to the voluntary separation and early retirement programs for employees, $2.2 billion in restructuring charges from fleet-related decisions, and a $1.3 billion CARES Act benefit. This performance was driven by a $1.8 billion or 78 percent reduction in fuel expense, a 75 percent reduction in maintenance expense from parking or retiring nearly 40 percent of mainline aircraft and lower volume- and revenue-related expenses. Salaries and benefits expense was down 32 percent as a result of approximately 18,000 employees electing to depart the company in addition to benefits from voluntary unpaid leaves, work hour reductions and other initiatives.\nNon-operating expense for the quarter was $349 million higher versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by $221 million in higher interest expense from increased debt levels the company has incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Our results this quarter were underpinned by a strong focus on costs, as we reduced adjusted operating expenses by more than 50 percent, similar to the June quarter, despite flying 23 points more capacity,\" said Paul Jacobson, Delta's chief financial officer. \"That cost focus allowed the increase we've seen in net sales to flow directly into an improvement in our daily cash burn, which improved from $27 million per day in June to $18 million per day in September.\"\nBalance Sheet, Cash and Liquidity\nDelta ended the September quarter with $21.6 billion in liquidity. Cash used in operations during the quarter was $2.6 billion. Daily cash burn averaged $24 million for the quarter, with an average of $18 million for the month of September.\nAt the end of the September quarter, the company had total debt and finance lease obligations of $34.9 billion with adjusted net debt of $17.0 billion, $6.5 billion higher than December 31, 2019. In September, Delta completed the largest debt offering in aviation history, raising $9.0 billion at a blended average rate of 4.75 percent secured by its SkyMiles loyalty program. In addition, the company borrowed $1.5 billion at a blended yield of 4.4 percent in connection with the issuance of tax-exempt bonds, that will be used to finance the LaGuardia airport project. The company's total debt had a weighted average interest rate of 4.3 percent at September 30, 2020.\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, the company repaid the $3 billion, 364-day term loan that it entered into in March, increasing its unencumbered asset base to $9 to $10 billion of aircraft, engines and spare parts and reducing remaining debt amortization and maturities to $2.3 billion through the end of 2021. The company also repaid $2.6 billion under its revolving credit facilities drawn down in March 2020.\nAt the end of the September quarter, the company's Air Traffic Liability stood at $4.6 billion, including a current liability of $4.4 billion and a non-current liability of $0.2 billion. The non-current liability represents the current estimate of tickets to be flown, as well as credits to be used, beyond one year. Travel credits represent approximately 60 percent of the Air Traffic Liability at the end of the September quarter.\nCARES Act Accounting, Fleet Restructuring and Voluntary Separation and Early Retirement Program Charges\nIn the September quarter, the company received $701 million under the payroll support program (PSP) of the CARES Act, consisting of $491 million in additional grant funds and a $210 million increase in the low-interest, unsecured 10-year loan. The September quarter amount includes an incremental $157 million beyond the initial $5.4 billion Delta was allocated in April 2020. In the September quarter, approximately $1.3 billion of the grant was recognized as a contra-expense, which is reflected as \"CARES Act grant recognition\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The company expects to use the remaining proceeds from the PSP by the end of 2020.\nDuring the September quarter, the company made the decision to retire its 717-200 fleet and the remainder of its 767-300ER fleet by 2025 and its CRJ-200 fleet by 2023. As a result of these decisions, the company recorded $2.2 billion in fleet-related charges, which are reflected in \"Restructuring charges\" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nThe company offered voluntary separation and early retirement programs to employees during the September quarter. Approximately 18,000 employees participated in the programs, with most leaving the company August 1, resulting in a $3.1 billion restructuring charge in the September quarter, which is reflected in \"Restructuring charges\" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Cash payments in connection with these programs totaled $813 million in the September quarter, and these payments are excluded from daily cash burn figures. The company anticipates an additional $150 to $250 million in cash payments in the December quarter, $600 million in 2021 and the remaining payments in 2022 and beyond.\nSeptember Quarter Results\nSeptember quarter results have been adjusted primarily for the CARES Act grant recognition and restructuring charges described above.\n|\nGAAP\n|\n$ Change\n|\n% Change\n|\n|\n($ in millions except per share and unit costs)\n|\n3Q20\n|\n3Q19\n|\n|\nPre-tax (loss)/income\n|\n(6,859)\n|\n|\n1,947\n|\n|\n(8,806)\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nNet (loss)/income\n|\n(5,379)\n|\n|\n1,495\n|\n|\n(6,874)\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nDiluted (loss)/earnings per share\n|\n(8.47)\n|\n|\n2.31\n|\n|\n(10.78)\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nOperating revenue\n|\n3,062\n|\n|\n12,560\n|\n|\n(9,498)\n|\n|\n(76)\n|\n%\n|\n|\nOperating expense\n|\n9,448\n|\n|\n10,489\n|\n|\n(1,041)\n|\n|\n(10)\n|\n%\n|\n|\nFuel expense\n|\n486\n|\n|\n2,239\n|\n|\n(1,753)\n|\n|\n(78)\n|\n%\n|\n|\nNon-operating expense\n|\n473\n|\n|\n124\n|\n|\n349\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nTotal debt and finance lease obligations\n|\n34,870\n|\n|\n10,119\n|\n|\n24,751\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nTotal revenue per available seat mile (TRASM)\n|\n10.82\n|\n|\n16.58\n|\n|\n(5.76)\n|\n|\n(35)\n|\n%\n|\n|\nConsolidated unit cost (CASM)\n|\n33.40\n|\n|\n13.85\n|\n|\n19.55\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nAverage fuel price per gallon\n|\n1.25\n|\n|\n1.94\n|\n|\n(0.69)\n|\n|\n(36)\n|\n%\n|\n|\n|\nAdjusted\n|\n$ Change\n|\n% Change\n|\n|\n($ in millions except per share and unit costs)\n|\n3Q20\n|\n3Q19\n|\n|\nPre-tax (loss)/income\n|\n(2,589)\n|\n|\n1,968\n|\n|\n(4,557)\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nNet (loss)/income\n|\n(2,096)\n|\n|\n1,507\n|\n|\n(3,603)\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nDiluted (loss)/earnings per share\n|\n(3.30)\n|\n|\n2.33\n|\n|\n(5.63)\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nOperating revenue\n|\n2,645\n|\n|\n12,507\n|\n|\n(9,861)\n|\n|\n(79)\n|\n%\n|\n|\nOperating expense\n|\n5,004\n|\n|\n10,460\n|\n|\n(5,455)\n|\n|\n(52)\n|\n%\n|\n|\nFuel expense\n|\n489\n|\n|\n2,257\n|\n|\n(1,768)\n|\n|\n(78)\n|\n%\n|\n|\nNon-operating expense\n|\n230\n|\n|\n79\n|\n|\n151\n|\n|\nNM\n|\n|\nAdjusted net debt\n|\n17,012\n|\n|\n10,265\n|\n|\n6,747\n|\n|\n66\n|\n%\n|\n|\nTotal revenue per available seat mile (TRASM, adjusted)\n|\n9.35\n|\n|\n16.51\n|\n|\n(7.16)\n|\n|\n(43)\n|\n%\n|\n|\nConsolidated unit cost (CASM-Ex)\n|\n15.96\n|\n|\n10.15\n|\n|\n5.81\n|\n|\n57\n|\n%\n|\n|\nAverage fuel price per gallon\n|\n1.25\n|\n|\n1.96\n|\n|\n(0.71)\n|\n|\n(36)\n|\n%\n|\nAbout Delta Air Lines\nDelta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) is the U.S. global airline leader in safety, innovation, reliability and customer experience.

Reconciliations may not calculate due to rounding.\nDelta sometimes uses information (\"non-GAAP financial measures\") that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The tables below show reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nForward Looking Projections. Delta is not able to reconcile forward looking non-GAAP financial measures because the adjusting items such as those used in the reconciliations below will not be known until the end of the period and could be significant.\nPre-Tax (Loss)/Income and Net (Loss)/Income, adjusted. In the current period, pre-tax (loss)/income and net (loss)/income, adjusted exclude the following items directly related to the impact of COVID-19 and our response for comparability with the prior period:\nRestructuring charges. We recognized $5.3 billion of restructuring charges following strategic business decisions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These charges primarily include voluntary early retirement and separation program charges and impairments and related charges from the decisions to retire the remaining 767-300ER fleet and the 717 and CRJ-200 fleets.\nCARES Act grant recognition. We recognized $1.3 billion of the grant proceeds from the CARES Act payroll support program as a contra-expense. We are recognizing the grant proceeds as contra-expense based on the periods that the funds are intended to compensate and we expect to use all proceeds from the payroll support program by the end of 2020.\nImpairments and equity method losses. These charges relate to the write-down of our investment in Virgin Atlantic based on our share of its losses.\nPension settlement charges. These charges were recognized in connection with the voluntary programs.\nWe also regularly adjust pre-tax (loss)/income and net (loss)/income for the following items to determine pre-tax (loss)/income and net (loss)/income, adjusted for the reasons described below. We include the income tax effect of adjustments when presenting net (loss)/income, adjusted.\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges. Mark-to-market (\"MTM\") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period.\nEquity investment MTM adjustments. We previously recorded our proportionate share of losses from our equity investments in Virgin Atlantic, Grupo Aerom\u00e9xico and LATAM in non-operating expense. (As a result of Grupo Aerom\u00e9xico's and LATAM's bankruptcy filings, we no longer have significant influence with Grupo Aerom\u00e9xico or LATAM and have discontinued accounting for these investments under the equity method in the June 2020 quarter.) We adjust for our equity method investees' hedge portfolio MTM adjustments to allow investors to understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.\nMTM adjustments on investments. Unrealized gains/losses on our equity investments in China Eastern, Air France-KLM and Hanjin-KAL, the largest shareholder of Korean Air, which are accounted for at fair value in non-operating expense, are driven by changes in stock prices and foreign currency. Adjusting for these gains/losses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.\nDelta Private Jets adjustment. Because we combined Delta Private Jets with Wheels Up in January 2020, we have excluded the impact of Delta Private Jets from 2019 results for comparability.\n|\nThree Months Ended\n|\n|\nThree Months Ended\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2020\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2020\n|\n|\nPre-Tax\n|\nIncome\n|\nNet\n|\n|\nNet Loss\n|\n|\n(in millions, except per share data)\n|\nLoss\n|\nTax\n|\nLoss\n|\n|\nPer Diluted Share\n|\n|\nGAAP\n|\n$\n|\n(6,859)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n1,480\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(5,379)\n|\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(8.47)\n|\n|\n|\nLess: Restructuring charges\n|\n5,345\n|\n|\n(1,271)\n|\n|\n4,074\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLess: CARES Act grant recognition\n|\n(1,315)\n|\n|\n313\n|\n|\n(1,002)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLess: Impairments and equity method losses\n|\n114\n|\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n114\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nLess: Pension settlement charges\n|\n30\n|\n(7)\n|\n|\n23\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAdjusted for:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges\n|\n(3)\n|\n|\n1\n|\n|\n(2)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nEquity investment MTM adjustments\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nMTM adjustments on investments\n|\n99\n|\n|\n(23)\n|\n|\n76\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNon-GAAP\n|\n$\n|\n(2,589)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n493\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(2,096)\n|\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(3.30)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThree Months Ended\n|\n|\nThree Months Ended\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2019\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2019\n|\n|\nPre-Tax\n|\nIncome\n|\nNet\n|\n|\nNet Income\n|\n|\n(in millions, except per share data)\n|\nIncome\n|\nTax\n|\nIncome\n|\n|\nPer Diluted Share\n|\n|\nGAAP\n|\n$\n|\n1,947\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(452)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n1,495\n|\n|\n|\n$\n|\n2.31\n|\n|\n|\nAdjusted for:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges\n|\n(25)\n|\n|\n6\n|\n|\n(19)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nEquity investment MTM adjustments\n|\n10\n|\n|\n(2)\n|\n|\n8\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nMTM adjustments on investments\n|\n35\n|\n|\n(13)\n|\n|\n22\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDelta Private Jets adjustment\n|\n1\n|\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n1\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNon-GAAP\n|\n$\n|\n1,968\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(461)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n1,507\n|\n|\n|\n$\n|\n2.33\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOperating Revenue, adjusted and Total Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (\"TRASM\"), adjusted.

We adjust operating revenue and TRASM for refinery sales to third parties to determine operating revenue, adjusted and TRASM, adjusted because these revenues are not related to our airline segment. Operating revenue, adjusted and TRASM, adjusted therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of revenue from our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.\n|\n|\n|\nThree Months Ended\n|\n|\n|\n|\n(in millions)\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2020\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2019\n|\n|\nChange\n|\n|\nOperating revenue\n|\n$\n|\n3,062\n|\n|\n|\n$\n|\n12,560\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAdjusted for:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThird-party refinery sales\n|\n(417)\n|\n|\n|\n(6)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDelta Private Jets adjustment\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n|\n(47)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOperating revenue, adjusted\n|\n$\n|\n2,645\n|\n|\n|\n$\n|\n12,507\n|\n|\n|\n(79)\n|\n%\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNine Months Ended\n|\n|\n|\n|\n(in millions)\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2020\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2019\n|\n|\nChange\n|\n|\nOperating revenue\n|\n$\n|\n13,122\n|\n|\n|\n$\n|\n35,568\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAdjusted for:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThird-party refinery sales\n|\n(709)\n|\n|\n|\n(94)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDelta Private Jets adjustment\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n|\n(139)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nOperating revenue, adjusted\n|\n$\n|\n12,413\n|\n|\n|\n$\n|\n35,335\n|\n|\n|\n(65)\n|\n%\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThree Months Ended\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2020\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2019\n|\n|\nChange\n|\n|\nTRASM (cents)\n|\n10.82\n|\n|\n|\n16.58\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAdjusted for:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThird-party refinery sales\n|\n(1.47)\n|\n|\n|\n(0.01)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDelta Private Jets adjustment\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n|\n(0.06)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nTRASM, adjusted\n|\n9.35\n|\n|\n|\n16.51\n|\n|\n|\n(43)\n|\n%\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNine Months Ended\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2020\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2019\n|\n|\nChange\n|\n|\nTRASM (cents)\n|\n13.42\n|\n|\n|\n16.94\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nAdjusted for:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThird-party refinery sales\n|\n(0.73)\n|\n|\n|\n(0.05)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nDelta Private Jets adjustment\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n|\n(0.07)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nTRASM, adjusted\n|\n12.70\n|\n|\n|\n16.83\n|\n|\n|\n(25)\n|\n%\n|\nOperating Expense, adjusted.

We present cash burn because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to maintain liquidity and return to cash generation. The company defines cash burn as net cash from operating activities and net cash used in investing activities, adjusted for (i) net purchases of short-term investments, (ii) strategic investments, (iii) net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects, (iv) proceeds from financing arrangements that are reported within investing activities, (v) CARES Act grant proceeds, and (vi) other charges that are not representative of our core operations, such as charges associated with our voluntary separation and early retirement programs. Adjustments include:\nNet purchases of short-term investments. Net purchases of short-term investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period, including gains and losses. We adjust for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow generated by our operations.\nStrategic investments. Cash flows related to our investments in and related transactions with other airlines are included in our GAAP investing activities. We adjust for this activity because it provides a more meaningful comparison to our airline industry peers.\nNet cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities and capital expenditures. We have adjusted for these items, which were primarily funded by cash restricted for airport construction, to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow and capital expenditures that are core to our operational performance in the periods shown.\nProceeds from financing arrangements that are reported within investing activities.\nCash flows from proceeds from financing arrangements that are reported within investing activities (such as certain sale-leaseback transactions) are removed from free cash flow in calculating daily cash burn to better illustrate the cash generated from our core operations.\nCARES Act grant proceeds. Cash flows related to the CARES act payroll support program grant proceeds, reported within operating activities in GAAP results. We adjust free cash flow for this item in calculating daily cash burn to better illustrate the cash from our core operations.\nVoluntary programs. Cash flows from the voluntary separation and early retirement programs offered to employees during the September quarter, reported within operating activities in GAAP results. We adjust free cash flow for this item in calculating daily cash burn to better illustrate the cash from our core operations.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThree Months Ended\n|\nMonth Ended\n|\nMonth Ended\n|\n|\n(in millions)\n|\n|\n|\nSeptember 30, 2020\n|\nSeptember 30, 2020\n|\nJune 30, 2020\n|\n|\nNet cash used in operating activities\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(2,575)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(720)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n75\n|\n|\n|\nNet cash used in investing activities\n|\n|\n(1,144)\n|\n|\n(1,033)\n|\n|\n(754)\n|\n|\n|\nAdjustments:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNet purchases of short-term investments\n|\n|\n745\n|\n|\n1,007\n|\n|\n1,091\n|\n|\n|\nStrategic investments\n|\n|\n235\n|\n|\n(15)\n|\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n|\nNet cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other\n|\n|\n208\n|\n|\n8\n|\n|\n(30)\n|\n|\n|\nTotal free cash flow\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(2,531)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(753)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n382\n|\n|\n|\nProceeds from financing arrangements reported within investing activities\n|\n|\n37\n|\n|\n37\n|\n|\n(422)\n|\n|\n|\nCARES Act grant proceeds\n|\n|\n(491)\n|\n|\n(110)\n|\n|\n(761)\n|\n|\n|\nVoluntary programs\n|\n|\n813\n|\n|\n273\n|\n|\n\u2014\n|\n|\n|\nAdjusted free cash flow\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(2,173)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(553)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(801)\n|\n|\n|\nDays in period\n|\n|\n92\n|\n|\n30\n|\n|\n30\n|\n|\n|\nAverage daily cash burn\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(24)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(18)\n|\n|\n$\n|\n(27)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nFuel expense, adjusted and Average fuel price per gallon, adjusted.

      "text": "\u2018The future is already here\u2014it\u2019s just not evenly distributed,\u2019 said speculative fiction author William Gibson. This sentiment echoes through the results of PwC\u2019s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey, based on responses from 4,701 chief executives representing every region of the world economy.\nSome CEOs are moving rapidly to capture the growth and value-creation potential inherent in the defining forces of our era. They\u2019re investing in generative AI, addressing the opportunities and threats posed by climate change, and reinventing their operations and business models to create value in new ways. Yet many others are moving slowly, constrained by leadership mindsets and processes that lead to inertia.\nThis latter group has two options: either accelerate their reinvention efforts or bet on hope\u2014hope that, with just a few tweaks, today\u2019s operating and business models will continue to deliver results even as AI and the transition to a low-carbon economy set value in motion across the economy.\nAmong the key findings:\nExpectations for GenAI remain high. One-third of CEOs say GenAI has increased revenue and profitability over the past year, and half expect their investments in the technology to increase profits in the year ahead. Yet trust remains a hurdle to adoption.\nInvestment in climate actions and sustainability is paying off. One in three CEOs report that climate-friendly investments made over the last five years have resulted in increased revenue. In addition, two-thirds say these investments have either reduced costs or had no significant cost impact.\nSector boundaries are blurring. Almost 40% of CEOs say their companies started to compete in new sectors in the last five years. Consistent with last year\u2019s survey, four in ten CEOs believe their company will no longer be viable in ten years if it continues on its current path.\nThe pace of reinvention is slow. On average, only 7% of revenue over the last five years has come from distinct new businesses added by organisations in this period. Barriers to reinvention include weak decision-making processes, low levels of resource reallocation from year to year, and a mismatch between the short expected tenure of many CEOs and powerful long-term forces, or megatrends, at work.\nUnderlining the tension across time horizons, CEOs are optimistic about the near-term outlook even as they worry about their company\u2019s long-term viability. Almost 60% expected global economic growth to increase over the next 12 months, up from 38% in last year\u2019s survey and only 18% two years ago. By a ratio of more than two to one, CEOs expect to increase rather than decrease (42% vs. 17%) headcount in the year ahead.\nOnly two years after GenAI appeared on the radar of most executives, companies around the world are adopting it at scale. What\u2019s more, many CEOs are seeing promising results. More than half (56%) tell us that GenAI has resulted in efficiencies in how employees use their time, while around one-third report increased revenue (32%) and profitability (34%).\nThese outcomes are slightly below the heady expectations CEOs shared with us a year ago, but this has not dampened their optimism. CEO expectations for GenAI impacts in the year ahead are, in fact, remarkably similar to those reported in last year\u2019s survey. About half of CEOs (49%) expect GenAI to increase the profitability of their company over the next 12 months.\nThese figures are broadly consistent with other PwC research among executives, employees and investors. In PwC\u2019s Global Workforce Hopes & Fears Survey 2024, 62% of employees said they expected GenAI to increase their efficiency at work over the next 12 months. In our Global Investor Survey 2024, two-thirds of investors and analysts said they expect the companies in which they invest to achieve productivity gains from GenAI in the year ahead.\nAlthough it is early days, there\u2019s nothing in our data to suggest a widespread reduction in employment opportunities across the global economy. Some CEOs (13%) say they have reduced headcount in the last 12 months due to GenAI; companies in insurance, retail, pharmaceuticals and life sciences were most likely to have made such cuts (16%). Yet a slightly higher percentage (17%) tell us that headcount has increased as a result of GenAI investments.\nLooking forward, almost half of CEOs say that their biggest priorities over the next three years are integrating AI (including GenAI) into technology platforms as well as business processes and workflows. Fewer are planning to use AI to develop new products and services or reshape core business strategy. For most companies, this order of priorities makes sense. More surprising is that only a third of CEOs are planning to integrate AI into workforce and skills strategy. This could be a misstep. Realising the potential of GenAI will depend on employees knowing when and how to use AI tools in their work\u2014and understanding the potential pitfalls.\nYour next move: Keep your eyes on the prize. GenAI is still quite new in terms of its technical evolution, and is just starting its journey to widespread adoption in business. So, it should not be surprising that almost two-thirds of companies have yet to see concrete financial results from it. The challenge facing CEOs is to keep their organisation\u2019s eyes on the prize amid the froth that accompanies the introduction of every major technology. Capturing the productivity potential of GenAI will soon be table stakes in many industries. Realising these gains requires a systematic approach to deciding where to implement the technology, plus investment in data readiness, integration of GenAI into technology platforms and workflows, and effective programmes to build workforce skills. These foundational moves will also position organisations to seize bigger opportunities ahead, whether this means transforming a specific function or undertaking a more dramatic change of business model. The impact of GenAI will vary among sectors, but its disruptive potential in most is high.\nWhen we asked CEOs to take stock of the financial impact of their climate-friendly investments over the last five years, we found that these moves were six times as likely to have increased revenue as to have decreased it. In addition, around two-thirds of CEOs report that climate-friendly investments have either reduced costs or had no significant impact.\nThese gains and costs are not distributed equally, and the variances are driven in part by the mix of incentives and regulations in different countries. For example, around half of CEOs in Germany and France report that making climate-friendly investments over the last five years has resulted in increased costs, against only one-fifth of their US counterparts. On the flip side, CEOs in the Chinese Mainland are much more likely to report additional revenues arising from these investments (60%), as well as additional government incentives received (46%), than their counterparts in other regions of the world.\nAfter adjusting for geography and other factors, however, we find that making climate-friendly investments is associated with higher profit margins. This finding is consistent with analysis of last year\u2019s CEO Survey data, which showed a link between a wide variety of climate actions and stronger financial performance. Also relevant is recent Harvard Business School research (published in PwC\u2019s strategy+business), which found faster revenue growth among firms that are transitioning their product portfolio towards climate solutions.\nCrucially, most investors are persuaded by such evidence. In the recent PwC Global Investor Survey 2024, almost 70% agreed that companies should make expenditures to address sustainability/ESG issues relevant to the business, even if it reduces near-term profitability. In addition, more than half of all CEOs globally (56%) say their personal incentive compensation is linked to sustainability metrics. The higher the percentage of CEO compensation at stake, the more revenue that\u2019s likely to be coming from climate-friendly investments.\nYour next move: Search for sustainable value. Creating value from sustainability starts with CEOs challenging themselves and their top teams to bring climate-friendly products, services and technologies to market. As noted above, one-third of companies are now generating revenue from climate investments made over the last five years. This percentage will increase as economies decarbonise.\nBeyond this effort, take a hard look at your company\u2019s resource use and energy consumption. This means tackling the so-called energy trilemma: simultaneously ensuring a reliable energy supply, reducing emissions and trimming costs. Value is in motion across the world\u2019s energy systems, as many organisations start to play the dual role of producer\u2013consumer. These energy \u2018prosumers\u2019 might still purchase electricity from the grid\u2014but they also produce their own electricity, store it and sell it.\nOne further action item: implement a data strategy for sustainability. This will enable your company to meet new reporting requirements while also providing leaders throughout the business with accurate, fact-based insights to inform decisions.\nIn a finding that might seem surprising against a backdrop of geopolitical and trade tension, CEOs tell us they are optimistic about the outlook for the global economy. Almost 60% expect global growth to improve in the 12 months ahead, up from 38% in last year\u2019s survey and only 18% two years ago. They also remain broadly confident about the outlook for their own company. Notably, more than twice as many expect to increase headcount in the year ahead (42%) as expect to reduce it (17%).\nThese figures represent a snapshot of sentiment in October to early November 2024, when our survey was in the field, and CEOs were by no means oblivious to the risks. Macroeconomic volatility was cited as the threat most likely to precipitate a substantial financial loss in the year ahead.\nWithin the broadly optimistic picture, there are also stark differences between countries. Among the G20 countries, CEOs in Germany are gloomiest about the outlook for the domestic economy, reflecting an industrial base experiencing not only weak demand but also supply shortages in energy, components, skilled labour and other areas. At the opposite end of the spectrum, CEOs in India and Argentina are most optimistic. Nine out of ten CEOs in India (87%) expect domestic economic growth to accelerate in the year ahead.\nYour next move: Calibrate your perspective. There\u2019s no such thing as a global CEO. Even the most well-travelled executive was born somewhere, resides somewhere, and is influenced by local preoccupations. Our survey data offers an opportunity to stress-test personal assumptions against those of neighbours, peers and competitors. For example, are Italian companies, in fact, less exposed to cyberattack than their counterparts in the UK or France, as our data suggests? A sector-by-sector view is equally revealing. Although climate change is close to the bottom of the list of near-term threats in most industries, CEOs in insurance and the power and utilities sectors rank it in their top three for the year ahead. If your company relies on these companies (as most do), this is food for thought.\nConsider also the connections between threats that could amplify their impacts. Many critical supply chains (for semiconductors, for example) are vulnerable both to extreme weather events and to geopolitical rivalries. Equally, the link between geopolitics and cyber risk is increasingly evident. More than ever, systems thinking is needed to anticipate what may lie ahead.\nMany business leaders recognise the need to reinvent their business models. Consistent with our last two annual surveys, four in ten CEOs (42%) say their company will remain viable for less than ten years if it continues on its current path.\nSince we first asked this question two years ago, the industries in which CEOs feel most under pressure to reinvent have been largely consistent: media and entertainment, technology, telecom, and industrial manufacturing. These are all sectors in which digitisation, decarbonisation or both are changing the basis of competition. Yet there are now signs of rising anxiety elsewhere. In 2023, only 28% of pharmaceutical CEOs said their company wouldn\u2019t be viable for more than ten years if it continued on its current path. Last year, this increased to 38%, and again this year to 45%. Among other factors, this likely reflects growing realisation that AI could revolutionise drug discovery and many aspects of patient care.\nAcross all sectors, just under two-thirds of CEOs (63%) report having taken at least one significant action to change how their company creates, delivers and captures value. The most common reinvention actions are product and service innovation and moves to target new customer groups. Fewer companies have taken actions that typically come with higher degrees of difficulty\u2014such as pioneering new routes to market, implementing new pricing models or collaborating with other organisations to create new ecosystems.\nWill these moves be enough to power reinvention? For many CEOs, the honest answer will be no. Consider, for example, the percentage of revenue that companies get from new businesses, a measure of how fast they are growing beyond the core. Across our sample, on average, only 7% of revenue in the last five years has come from fundamentally distinct businesses that organisations added in this period. Companies in the Middle East and the Chinese Mainland are ahead, with 10% or more of revenue coming from new businesses. For Japanese companies, the average is only 3%.\nIf CEOs need further encouragement to double down on reinvention, they should note that we see a strong association in the data between the number of reinvention actions companies have taken and the profit margins they achieve. Companies taking more actions also report bigger gains from GenAI over the last year.\nYour next move: Look outwards. The road to reinvention starts with customers\u2014and this maxim applies equally to B2C and B2B companies. In our experience, a determined effort to refocus on unmet needs, pain points and every other aspect of the customer experience can catalyse innovation. Importantly, this often includes changes that take the company outside its comfort zone\u2014for example, moving beyond the product road map to consider new pricing models, new routes to market or new alliances that add value for customers in new ways. In addition, we recommend looking for external triggers that might arise quickly and create customer needs. The rise of GenAI is one such example. Consider also leading indicators that your industry or an adjacent sector is ripe for reinvention. Telltale signs include the arrival of market entrants, a rise in venture capital investment or a rapid redistribution of market share among incumbents.\nMore than three decades of digitisation have already started to erode boundaries between sectors. Our strong belief is that the interactions among climate change, AI and other megatrends will hasten the process of reconfiguration and create new domains of growth that cut across sectors. Consider, for example, recent boundary-breaking moves by tech giants into nuclear power generation, reflecting the complex interplay of AI and climate change.\nNearly four in ten CEOs tell us that their companies have started to compete in at least one new sector in the last five years. Although many of these initiatives have been small, about one-third of CEOs making cross-sector moves said these represented 20% or more of company revenue over the period. There are companies of all sizes in this group, but those at the smaller end of our sample (with revenues below US$100 million) are represented more heavily. When it comes to venturing beyond sector boundaries, agility matters.\nAmong the sectors CEOs say they are moving into are business services (with new competitors coming from technology, telecommunications and media), health services (with new competitors coming from insurance, tech and telecom), and consumer markets (with new competitors coming from pharmaceuticals, banking and media). These findings ring true. Consider, for example, moves by telecom companies to generate additional revenue by offering business customers a range of services beyond connectivity, or moves by health insurers into healthcare provision, or moves by banks to offer consumers additional fee-based services.\nYour next move: Envision your ecosystem. We expect industry reconfiguration to accelerate in the decade to come. For CEOs, the challenge is to envision the ecosystem in which their company will operate in the future. This means thinking through the impacts of megatrends (notably, but not only, climate change and AI), how customer needs will change, how value pools will shift and what roles distinct types of companies will play.\nHere\u2019s what Tracy Robinson, CEO of CN Rail, one of North America\u2019s \u2018big six\u2019 rail operators, told us about the future of her industry: \u2018What [railroads] need to do is be more like trucks by getting together as a full supply chain. It can involve ports, terminals, warehouses, multiple railroads and trucks. But we need to come up with one service package that not only is easy to use and understand but also operates fast and consistently. If we can do that, I think you\u2019ll see a very positive impact, not only on the economy but also on emissions.\u2019\nAlliances and partnerships are essential sources of learning (as well as revenue) on the journey towards new domains of growth. New expertise within the executive team may also be needed, although hiring one or two new functional leaders is never the full solution. Navigating industry reconfiguration is a job for the top team as a whole, with strong support from the board.\nLeading a company during a period of great change requires decision-making that is well informed, disciplined and unbiased. Yet many CEOs tell us that their company\u2019s strategic decision-making processes are inconsistent at best. For example, proven practices for countering confirmation bias include making decision criteria transparent in advance, deliberately canvassing alternative points of view and intentionally seeking out information that contradicts the investment hypothesis. Only about half of companies regularly employ the full suite of these techniques for strategic decisions.\nSimilarly, almost six in ten CEOs told us that they usually judge strategic decisions by their outcomes, not by the quality of the process. At first glance, this makes perfect sense. CEOs are results-oriented and take pride in that trait. The snag is that outcomes are often determined by factors, including luck, that are beyond the control of the decision-makers. The only thing leaders can fully control is the quality of the decision-making process.\nOur survey results suggest that CEOs are leaving money on the table by not following the best practices of decision-making: companies with higher-quality processes for making strategic decisions report higher profit margins (as always, this is after controlling for industry, geography, company size and other factors that might skew the data).\nYour next move: Prioritise process. Decisions sometimes need to be made quickly, before every box has been ticked. But there is compelling evidence that stronger decision-making processes typically result in better decisions\u2014especially under conditions of uncertainty, when intuition and experience are unreliable guides. In the current environment, with very high levels of uncertainty across multiple dimensions, decision quality is paramount.\nThorough, fact-based decision-making also comes into its own when emotions run high. On climate change, for example, CEOs are under scrutiny from customers, employees, investors and even family members. The same goes for how CEOs handle decisions related to AI, and questions about the future of legacy businesses in the face of industry reconfiguration. In these circumstances, robust decision-making processes can break deadlocks and support a bias to action. Our survey data confirms this: CEOs who report stronger decision processes also report more reinvention actions.\nDynamic resource reallocation is a prerequisite for reinvention. For example, it is impossible to rapidly build a large new business without actively reallocating resources from lower-priority projects. Yet a large majority of companies lack agility when it comes to moving financial investments and people between projects and business units. About half of CEOs tell us that they reallocate 10% or less of financial and human resources from year to year. More than two-thirds say they reallocate less than 20%, a finding similar to that of last year\u2019s survey.\nDigging into the data, we find that active reallocation of people, in particular, is associated with higher profitability. The difference in profit margin between low human resource reallocation (less than 10%) and high reallocation (30\u201340%) is more than 2 percentage points. There is also a strong link between higher levels of resource reallocation (both financial and human resources) and the amount of revenue coming from distinct new businesses\u2014underlining that reinvention and dynamic resource reallocation go hand in hand.\nYour next move: Beat budgeting biases. Why don\u2019t companies reallocate resources more actively from year to year when the evidence in favour of doing so is so consistent? Cognitive biases are at work. These include anchoring (an overreliance on arbitrary benchmarks, such as last year\u2019s budget numbers) and naive diversification (the tendency to allocate resources equally across available options instead of weighting investments strategically). Organisational psychologist Robert Sutton reminded us that poorly designed incentives are also a factor: \u2018In so many organisations, when a manager has more people reporting to him or her, they get paid more. So, literally, we have incentives for people building larger and larger fiefdoms.\u2019\nFor CEOs, the solution lies in budgeting practices that minimise the impact of these psychological factors on resource allocation. For example, power dynamics can be reduced by holding project review meetings with small groups of stakeholders who have a high degree of independence. Also consider ranking projects company-wide by profitability or return on capital to create a common fact base for discussion.\nAs noted above, about half of CEOs believe that GenAI will increase the profitability of their company in the year ahead. At the same time, only a third (33%) say they have a high degree of trust in having AI embedded into key processes. As you might expect, CEOs who trust AI reported higher gains from GenAI over the last 12 months and expect higher gains from the technology in the year ahead. They are also more likely to be moving forward with integration of GenAI into technology platforms, business processes and workflows.\nThe wide distribution of CEO trust in AI mirrors that among the wider population. PwC\u2019s Voice of the Consumer Survey 2024 of 20,000 consumers globally found a similar spread of opinion. A key difference is that CEO opinions can have bigger consequences. The question for CEOs at the low end of the trust spectrum is whether they are actively working to understand and address the issues\u2014or simply allowing their scepticism to get in the way of the opportunity. At this early stage of GenAI\u2019s development, \u2018bounded optimism\u2019 feels like an appropriate stance. Uninformed pessimism does not.\nYour next move: Embrace Responsible AI. All CEOs need to walk before they can run with GenAI\u2014that is, avoid hurriedly deploying the technology in ways that may undermine the trust of customers, employees or other stakeholders. In practice, this means embracing the potential of this powerful, general-purpose technology while also taking steps to manage the risks, which include the potential for inaccurate outputs (\u2018hallucinations\u2019), creation of biased or offensive content and intellectual property issues related to the data on which GenAI models are trained. Responsible AI practices can mitigate\u2014though not yet eliminate\u2014many of these issues and are most effective when baked into GenAI strategy from the start. Equally, we recommend proactively addressing the potential societal impacts of GenAI by, for example, tracking the impact of adoption on company carbon emissions.\nBusiness, society and the competitive landscape are being reshaped by powerful forces that will play out over the decade to come. Yet when we asked CEOs how long they expect to remain in their current role, most answered five years or less. In addition, we see intriguing differences between the survey responses of CEOs with shorter expected tenure and those who expect to be in the role longer.\nThose with long expected tenure are more likely to:\nThese are statistical associations. We know many CEOs with a year or two of remaining tenure who are moving decisively to reinvent their company and capture the value-creation opportunities afforded by AI. Even so, the data highlights a corporate governance dilemma that, although hardly new, takes on additional weight at this decisive moment in business history.\nYour next move: Stretch your horizon. We are not going to argue that CEOs should enjoy longer tenures as a matter of standard practice. There are many governance- and performance-based reasons that companies (especially public companies) may want CEOs to move on. Even so, our survey data raises an important question for corporate boards: considering the long-term reconfiguration of industries now in progress, are you doing enough to encourage a \u2018through-tenure\u2019 perspective across the top team, balancing demands for near-term performance against the imperative to reinvent?\nWhat will the global economy look like in 2035? Although many scenarios are possible, the answer will depend significantly on how governments, corporations and civil society respond to the threat posed by climate change and the historic opportunity presented by AI. By extension, the companies most likely to thrive in the future are those that move now both to understand how these forces will reshape their industry and also to reimagine their business models, their operations, and their uses of technology, energy and other scarce resources.\nAgainst this backdrop, a few key questions for CEOs strongly suggest themselves:\nThis year\u2019s survey confirms that some CEOs have already asked these questions and, in partnership with their top team and board, have started to develop coherent answers. The challenge for this group is to maintain momentum while remaining acutely aware of the interplay between macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical reconfigurations and other threats that could yet derail progress.\nFor CEOs who have barely begun to address these issues, it is not too late. But such CEOs are, without question, falling behind. Playing catchup starts with making a concerted effort to develop a systems-level view of how customer needs and the competitive environment are changing. Then comes execution: a clear set of reinvention priorities, powered by high-quality decisions and at-scale resource reallocation, sustained by bounded optimism about what tomorrow could bring.\nConsumer markets CEOs are charting new paths: tackling inflation and supply chain challenges by prioritising agility, boosting efficiency and embracing climate initiatives to secure sustainable growth as consumer behaviours change.\nAmid climate and geopolitical challenges, energy, utilities and resources companies are making gains in sustainability. By harnessing AI and transitioning to renewables, they can lead a unified move toward a resilient future.\nFinancial services firms, which face significant risks from technological and cyber disruptions, are transforming their business models by using AI to foster innovation and growth.\nCEOs in our survey express doubts about their companies\u2019 long-term viability. This finding underscores an opportunity for governments and the private sector to collaborate, balancing regulation and technology to facilitate sustainable growth.\nHealthcare CEOs are optimistic about short-term growth but less positive about their companies\u2019 long-term prospects. Rapid industry changes and AI advancements require reinventing business models to make the most of new opportunities and ensure continued success.\nIndustrials and services companies are reinventing their business models to drive growth, actively exploring new sectors while balancing the pursuit of long-term AI transformation with the demand for immediate results.\nPrivate equity CEOs are leveraging climate-friendly investments and AI to boost productivity and profitability. Concerns about the industry\u2019s long-term outlook, especially in smaller firms, can be addressed with a continued focus on business model reinvention.\nCompanies in technology, media and telecom are harnessing AI to reinvent their business models, with the aim of enhancing innovation and efficiency while spurring transformative change in other industries.\nFor questions about the data, including additional cuts, contact the CEO Survey research and analytics team.\nFor media inquiries, contact Dan Barabas.\nGet s+b leadership insights direct to your inbox\nSelect a country or region from the list to explore local insights\nA practical guide for reimagining how your company creates, delivers, and captures value.\nTurning disruption into value creation.\nJi\u0159\u00ed Moser\nCountry Managing Partner and CEE Advisory leader, PwC Czech Republic\nTel: +420 251 152 048\nAzamat Konratbayev\nManaging Partner, PwC Eurasia Assurance Leader, PwC Kazakhstan\nTel: +7 727 330 3200\nMekong Territory Senior Partner and CEO for PwC Thailand, PwC Thailand\nTel: +66 (0) 2844 1000\nShirley Machaba\nRegional Senior Partner, PwC South Market Area, PwC South Africa\nTel: +27 (0) 11 797 5851"

      "text": "RedThread Study Uncovers Stark Decline of Trust in Performance Management Practices Amid Reduced Support for Employee Development\n- RedThread\n- Mar 7, 2024\n- 2 min read\nWOODSIDE, Calif., March 6, 2024- RedThread Research, human capital analysts and thought leaders, today released their newest groundbreaking report \u2014 \"Performance Management Trends 2024: Productivity At Any Cost?\" \u2014 which raises serious questions about the current state and future effectiveness of performance management practices in organizations.\nThis new report paints a concerning picture of the performance management landscape, finding that companies in 2023 were increasingly focused on immediate productivity \u2014 at the expense of long-term employee growth and satisfaction. In fact, 47% of employees said they believe the top reason companies manage their performance is to boost productivity. This represents a 9-point increase from 2022. However, the report findings show that companies that especially emphasized productivity were not any more likely to have highly productive employees.\n\"Employers are emphasizing productivity above all else,\" says Stacia Garr, RedThread's co-founder and principal report analyst. \"But that push for productivity has not actually translated into any better outcomes. Which means companies are chipping away at employee trust for no discernable gain.\"\nThe report also shows low levels of employee satisfaction with company performance management practices, with only 44% of employees expressing contentment in 2023. Additionally, only 39% feel that their companies provide a fair and consistent evaluation process \u2014 a noticeable drop from 48% in 2021.\n\"This isn't only a measure of whether employees think they are being fairly assessed,\" says Garr. \"Given that so much hinges on performance management \u2013 compensation, promotion, equity, engagement \u2013 the fact that most folks view it as unfair signals a deep-seated trust issue in organizations. This problem is likely to only intensify as AI and automation become more ingrained in the workplace.\"\nKey findings in the report include:\nEmployee satisfaction with performance management practices was only 44% in 2023.\nOnly 39% of employees view their company's evaluation process as fair and consistent in 2023.\nDespite a 9-point increase in the perception that companies used performance management mainly to drive productivity \u2014 those companies did not see better results.\nFewer than half (46%) of employees said their companies encouraged them to learn and develop skills regularly in 2023 - a 7-point decline compared with 2021.\nThere is a 10-point decrease from pre-pandemic levels in employees feeling encouraged to have regular conversations with managers.\nThese findings are part of a larger trend of diminishing support for managers and their effectiveness, a concern that RedThread Research has noted in their past research on manager effectiveness.\n\"The continued decline in support for managers is also alarming,\" added report author and Senior Analyst Priyanka Mehrotra, \"considering the unsteady ground on which managers already find themselves. When organizational support for performance decreases, it can impact employees' overall assessment of their managers' effectiveness, and their engagement \u2014 which makes this new report a worrying sign for the future of the workplace.\""

      "text": "How Cisco\u2019s employee engagement practices drive success at the $56bn tech giant\nEngagement and recognition are top of mind at Cisco to foster a healthy workplace. Two Cisco HR leaders, Amber Howe-McCarty and Roxanne Bisby Davis, shared the employer\u2019s recognition story at UNLEASH World 2024 \u2013 the Editorial team also sat down with the pair for an exclusive deep dive.\nUNLEASH World | HR Leader Interviews\nWhen it comes to Cisco\u2019s approach to engagement and recognition, \u201cwe have to make sure it\u2019s not just fun to do, but the story actually backs up the business value\u201d.\nAt UNLEASH World 2024, Amber Howe-McCarty and Roxanne Bisby Davis, Head of People Experience and Head of People Intelligence at Cisco respectively, took to the stage to share how that business case around recognition comes to life at the tech giant.\nThe Editorial team got the scoop in an exclusive interview with Howe-McCarty and Bisby Davis.\nFor the past decade, $56 billion-revenue technology giant Cisco has been on a journey to advance its purpose and culture.\nOne of the programs they\u2019ve incepted to drive employee engagement and value is exemplified in its \u2018\nIt first started with a few employees in the UK who wanted to move the needle to ensure that the employee experience and the company\u2019s goals were aligned.\nAs part of that culture shift, the tech giant looked at its recognition strategy and thought it could do better for its 80,000 people in 90 countries.\nThis new focus on recognition over the last ten years was what Cisco\u2019s Head of People Experience Amber Howe-McCarty and Head of People Intelligence Roxanne Bisby Davis spoke about on stage at UNLEASH World 2024.\nThe UNLEASH Editorial team caught up with Bisby Davis and Howe-McCarty on-site in Paris to dig in deeper.\nRecognition builds connection at Cisco\nIn 2014, Cisco didn\u2019t have a formal recognition program \u2013 \u201cwe had the ability for leaders to do spot bonuses\u201d, but \u201cthere was a very inconsistent experience across people globally\u201d.\nThe process \u201cdidn\u2019t have visibility and it lacked governance\u201d, Howe-McCarty tells UNLEASH.\nSo, the HR team looked at how they could transform the current system \u201cinto a more employee-centered program\u201d \u2013 the result was \u2018Connected Recognition\u2019, which is a tech-powered program and is part of the wider Connected Cisco HR strategy.\nThe aim of \u2018Connected Recognition\u2019 is that people were empowered to recognize others. Plus, it created more \u201cfairness and consistency\u201d across the company\u2019s global footprint.\nIt also creates a \u201cshared language\u201d around celebration \u2013 and that\u2019s \u201caligned to our cultural values and purpose across the entire company\u201d.\nThis builds momentum; \u201cit\u2019s powerful because greatness inspires more greatness,\u201d notes Howe-McCarty.\nGiven the name, \u2018Connected Recognition\u2019 is also about those workforce relationships and interactions. The new program ensures everyone can \u201creally see and celebrate all the amazing things that people were doing, which was hidden in the old spot bonus world\u201d, adds Howe-McCarty.\nBisby Davis sees Cisco\u2019s focus on purposefully investing in human interaction as a \u201cuniqueness\u201d \u2013 she shares that part of why the tech giant is a great employer (it is currently number 2 on Fortune\u2019s Best Places to Work list) because it is such a relationship-based organization.\n\u201cWe care about our impact on each other at an individual human level\u201d, adds Howe-McCarty.\nThe business case around recognition at Cisco\nAnother key part of formalizing recognition at Cisco was to collect data about \u201cthe value all of these amazing recognition moments were bringing\u201d, states Howe-McCarty.\nShe adds that Cisco is investing real money into this recognition program \u2013 \u201cwe have to make sure it\u2019s not just fun to do, but the story actually backs up the business value\u201d.\nThe data shows that 93% of leaders have recognized someone, and 90% of Cisco\u2019s 80,000 employees have received recognition.\nAnd this level of recognition is having a real positive impact on employees, which makes sense as \u201cattention is a thing all humans want\u201d, states Bisby Davis.\nHer People Intelligence team discovered that recognition drives greater connection to the organization, as well as a more engaged, happy workforce.\n\u201cWe have found the connection between recognition fueling engagement, and super strong correlations between engagement and our ability to retain our employees,\u201d adds Bisby Davis.\nAt the end of the day, \u201cwe want high levels of engagement because that is ultimately the thing within a business to keep people giving their discretionary effort\u201d, she continues.\n\u2018Connected Recognition\u2019 has truly enabled Cisco to make more \u201cdata-driven decisions\u201d, and it has helped \u201cto be able to show the value proposition to our leaders\u201d, notes Bisby Davis.\nWhat does the future of recognition look like at Cisco?\nWhile the Cisco\u2019s recognition program has seen huge success, there is still more work to be done.\nYes, nine in 10 workers have been recognized, but Bisby Davis\u2019 team also looks at who isn\u2019t interacting \u2013 \u201care there parts of the population that maybe are missed?\u201d\nThis has helped Cisco to create more personalized campaigns around recognition and the value \u2013 \u201cyou can build the most amazing program, if people don\u2019t use it, it doesn\u2019t have the value you\u2019re seeking\u201d, states Howe-McCarty.\nPlus, recognition data can empower managers and HR to talk to employees about their future careers at Cisco \u2013 Bisby Davis gives the example of saying to a colleague, \u201cit looks like you\u2019re doing a great job on a project we put you on; I\u2019m noticing you\u2019re getting a lot of recognition on this work.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conversation starter, and you can utilize that as you bring in understanding of the strengths of an individuals,\u201d she adds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing great, but we still have more to do\u201d on recognition and experience,\u201d states Howe-McCarty.\nThe next step of the recognition program for Cisco is to focus more on peer-to-peer recognition, and appreciation from direct leaders, because the data shows these types of recognition drives even more engagement.\nThe tech giant is also thinking about AI, and specifically generative AI, in HR. \u201c\n\u201cCisco is always looking at how we drive for a better you in your space as an employee,\u201d continues Bisby Davis.\nHowe-McCarty adds: \u201cBeing a large company, there could be ways that generative AI could help us build more connection, even easier\u201d, as well as provide \u201cvisibility of how recognition is happening [and] the fundamentals to continue on our journey with getting people to play\u201d with recognition.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to play the fine line between the mass amounts of data available to us, and how we use that data in a way that our employees are always in full agreement\u201d about its use, concludes Bisby Davis.\nBisby Davis and Howe-McCarty thoroughly enjoyed their time at UNLEASH World 2024.

A recent NYSE\u2011listed CEO survey shows that growth remains the top priority, but cost discipline, AI adoption, and climate\u2011friendly initiatives are key levers, and many CEOs are reallocating resources with precision. Parallel reports highlight declining employee trust in performance management, the importance of data\u2011driven recognition programs (as demonstrated by Cisco\u2019s Connected Recognition), and Delta Air Lines\u2019 cost\u2011cutting and restructuring efforts to navigate the pandemic\u2019s legacy.
