  "content": "Bonnie Blue revealed on Wednesday she may be off the dating market yet again, just months after announcing her divorce from ex-husband Oliver Davidson.\n\nThe controversial sex worker, who has made headlines for her shocking X-rated challenges, revealed in March she had split from her high-school sweetheart.\n\nBut now, after just a few months of enjoying the single life, Bonnie, 26, has said on The Kyle & Jackie O Show she is now being courted by a new beau.\n\nThe revelation was made when host Jackie 'O' Henderson asked the OnlyFans content creator if she was 'interested' in dating again after her divorce.\n\n'And where did he come from, this date?' Jackie, 50, asked.\n\n'Just one I\u2019ve known. Someone I\u2019ve known for a while,' Bonnie replied, ensuring she revealed very little information about her new man.\n\nBut Jackie didn't let up, as she pushed with more questions: 'So, you know him already? And you reckon he's pretty comfortable with what you do?\n\n'I say so,' Bonnie said simply, sticking to her guns.\n\nShe later added: 'What I do is a priority, I really enjoy it, and it makes me happy. So, whoever I am to date... is going to have to accept what I do.'\n\nWhen Bonnie revealed her divorce from Oliver in March on the Bad Friends podcast, she claimed it had 'nothing to do with' her controversial 1,000 men a day stunt.\n\nThe infamous adult star told hosts Andrew Santino and Bobby Lee the pair had simply 'grown apart' after more than ten years together.\n\nBonnie, who is from Derbyshire, said Oliver was in fact very supportive of her eye-popping stunts, the most recent of which saw her bed 1,057 men in just 12 hours.\n\n'We were together from when I was 14 and he was 15,' she told podcast listeners.\n\n'We got married at 20, we were together a long time and we just grew apart,' she said, saying there 'was no dramatic split up or anything like that'.\n\nShe insisted the two still keep in regular contact, with Oliver occasionally helping her edit her X-rated videos\u2014despite having grown 'apart naturally'.\n\nThe adult star has previously claimed she tied the knot with her school boyfriend Oliver in 2022 after meeting aged 15.\n\nThey moved to the Gold Coast in Australia shortly afterwards, which is where she abandoned her 9 to 5 job in recruitment and launched her career as a 'cam girl'.\n\nShe claimed it was her privately educated Long Eaton RFC rugby player husband who first encouraged her controversial career in the porn industry.\n\nReports initially emerged which suggested Oliver was 'furious' after Bonnie set a new world record by sleeping with 1,057 men in 12 hours.\n\nBut she went on to claim in a later interview that he was in fact 'very proud and supportive' of her success.",

And actually I've made jokes about it,' she said, referencing the Instagram post.\nShe said that she had used the money raised by media stunt to 'pay for other people's IVF'.\nThe release of the podcast comes just days after Bonnie took to social media to flaunt her brand new custom $500,000 (\u00a3387,300) Ferrari, which she claimed she purchased with her earnings from OnlyFans\nBonnie, who first found fame by sleeping with high school graduates during Schoolies, Freshers, and Spring Break, said that she's ready to do the stunt again - but this time with a twist\nIn January, Bonnie told DailyMail.com that she was raking in '$1 million a month' from her sordid sex stunts on OnlyFans\nBonnie has previously claimed that she would 'never lie about pregnancy', saying it is a 'step too far'.\n'So the last 24 hours, I\u2019ve hinted at being pregnant, but I had never confirmed I was pregnant because I would never ever lie about that,' she said in a 15-minute YouTube video in February.\nThe release of the podcast comes just days after Bonnie took to social media to flaunt her brand new custom $500,000 (\u00a3387,300) Ferrari, which she claimed she purchased with her earnings from OnlyFans.\nBonnie has previously been accused of faking her OnlyFans earnings, but told DailyMail.com that she isn't bothered by the criticism.\n'I don't need to fake my earnings, my lifestyle speaks for itself,' she said defiantly.\n'I'm grateful to the barely-legals and 1,057 men who afforded me my new Ferrari, and can't wait to continue to use my earnings to give back.'\nBonnie, who first found fame by sleeping with high school graduates during Schoolies, Freshers, and Spring Break, said that she's ready to do the stunt again - but this time with a twist.\n'Next up, I'll be at Spring Break, where I'll be paying the tuition of the boy who gives me the best orgasm and the one with the smallest penis,' she shared.\n'Sex is about having fun, and I can't wait to keep giving pleasure to sons and their dads by relieving them of their fluids - and their financial stresses.'\nIn January, Bonnie told DailyMail.com that she was raking in '$1 million a month' from her sordid sex stunts on OnlyFans.\n'I'm proud of my earnings but I'm prouder of the volume of people I'm able to pleasure,' she gushed.\n'The more money I earn the greater ability it gives me to become more creative in the ways in pleasure in the future.'\nMeanwhile, Bonnie was recently accused of 'faking' her record-breaking sex orgy by '90s porn legend Jasmin St. Claire, who broke the original world sex record back in 1996 by sleeping with 300 men.\nJasmin - whose record-breaking sexploits were documented in The World's Biggest Gang Bang II - believes that OnlyFans stars like Bonnie and Lily Phillips are fudging their numbers and copying the same stunts she originated back in the '90s."

      "text": "An OnlyFans star says she has set a 'world record' for having sex with the most men in one day - saying she 'bedded 1,057 in 12 hours'.\nBonnie Blue, 25, from Derbyshire, is reported to have topped the tally previously set by adult film actress Lisa Sparks when sleeping with 919 men in 24 hours in 2004.\nIn TikTok footage uploaded after carrying out the stunt in London last Saturday, Bonnie has now issued thanks to 'all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands' she says were involved.\nBlue has previously faced a backlash on social media by claiming to sleep with 'barely legal' 18-year-olds and saying men 'should cheat' on their wives.\nShe has also told of making up to \u00a3750,000 a month with her online activity which includes posting X-rated content on OnlyFans.\nIn the new footage, she described how her skin was looking better than before after going ahead with the event - while she also posted on Instagram: 'Over 1000 men in a day! thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing & the husbands.'\nThe sex worker said in one of two clips she posted online: 'This is what my face looks like after taking 1,000 men less than 12 hours ago'.\nAnd in the other clip, she told viewers: 'The big 1,000 was completely done.\nOnlyFans adult content creator Bonnie Blue, 25, says she has set a new world record by sleeping with more than 1,000 men in a day\nBlue, originally from Derbyshire, made the announcement in two new TikTok videos\n'The room was absolutely full. Then we did groups of five, like one after the other of fives.\n'One person would watch whilst I was with somebody, and then it would literally just be like a rotating circle like that.'\nHer claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours - or 720 minutes - suggests an average of 41 seconds per person.\nHer PR was quoted by the Sun as saying in a statement: 'She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.'\nComments posted in response to her latest TikTok videos include 'How embarrassing', 'Why would anyone do this?' and 'Sad that men would want to do that too - all for fame and money.'\nLast November she planned to fly to Australia for a free sex marathon with teenage school leavers. In exchange, they had to consent to her posting the content online.\nBut her 12-month visitor visa was cancelled by the country's Department of Home Affairs because she had voiced plans to undertake paid work, illegal under the visa's conditions.\nBlue, who says she used precautions to ensure the young men were aged over 18, had completed a similar marathon sex session stunt in the first weekend of Schoolies celebrations in Surfers Paradise, eastern Australia, in 2023.\nShe told viewers: 'This is what my face looks like after taking 1,000 men less than 12 hours ago'\nAdult content creator Bonnie Blue, 25, had set out her plan last year to break the 'world record' for sex with most men in one day, aiming to pass the 1,000 mark in just 24 hours\nAfter her latest Australian plan was rebuffed, she appeared on ITV's This Morning programme last November to defend herself against criticism - but faced more negative comments from viewers posting online.\nShe told the show: 'I'm still learning every day. But my content is educational to those that I'm sleeping with, and those that are watching it.\n'People say it's an unsafe environment, but I can't think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they've had to bring a passport, they've had to sign consent forms, they've had to do a breathalyser.'\nBonnie's real-name is Tia Billinger and she had previously been married to her childhood sweetheart, Oliver Davidson.\nThe pair wed in 2022 before moving to the Gold Coast in Australia shortly afterwards.\nIt was there that she abandoned her job in recruitment and launched her career as a 'cam girl' on porn sites.\nShe claims her then-husband supported her decision, however, the pair have since broken up.\nShe has said of her parents' response to being sent one of her sex tapes and discovering her new chosen vocation: 'They were shocked, but not disappointed.\nShe spoke of the event said to have taken place in London, telling TikTok viewers: 'The big 1,000 was completely done. The room was absolutely full'\nBonnie Blue has previously faced a backlash on social media by claiming to sleep with 'barely legal' 18-year-olds and saying men 'should cheat' on their wives\nAfter receiving overwhelming criticism and accusations of being a 'predator', Bonnie defended her 'career' on This Morning, as she insisted her actions were legal and 'educational'\n'I think, because I'd gone from an office business job to then suddenly [becoming] a sex worker, in their eyes I was a prostitute.\n'But it just showed me how much I needed to teach them. For the older generation it's so new.\n'Now they're so supportive, it's changed their life completely for the better. They go on lovely holidays. They have no money problems.\n'They don't work and they don't have a mortgage. My mum works for me. My mum makes signs for me to hold on camera and books my appointments. She was even handing out condoms to students for marketing.'\nBlue previously defended herself from critics in an interview with the Daily Mail, saying: 'I am not a predator.\n'These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink, they're choosing their careers for the rest of their life,' she said.\n'If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.'\n'We seem to say 18-year-olds don't know better. But if an 18-year-old commits a crime, the first thing they would say is that they're an adult, they should know better.'\nThe adult content creator claims to make hundreds of thousands of pounds per month through her X-rated OnlyFans account online\nBonnie's real-name is Tia Billinger and she was previously married to her childhood sweetheart Oliver Davidson in 2022 before launching her career as a 'cam girl' on porn sites\nShe has also faced criticism for boasting that she sleeps with married men, but says she doesn't feel guilty and thinks it better that they cheat with her if 'the wife's not bothered about having intercourse or having an intimate relationship'.\nShe said: 'If that's the case, the men are going to cheat whether you like it or not. They are the statistics and that is what people do. And I also think they deserve to enjoy sex.\n'It's a natural instinct to want to have sex, so if wives aren't going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. There's no intimacy, I can't remember their face by the end of the night.\n'If they're not sleeping with me, they're probably having an affair in the office or in the gym. With me it's just an act, I am a girl that sleeps around a lot. The husbands and partners mean nothing to me.'"

      "text": "'Barely legal' pornography featuring adults dressed as children could be banned by new government taskforce amid fury over Channel 4's Bonnie Blue documentary\nThe government could ban 'barely legal' pornography featuring adults dressed as children after Bonnie Blue's Channel 4 documentary sparked backlash for 'glamorising' extreme content.\nThe proposed ban by the independent pornography taskforce - set up in July by Conservative peer Gabby Bertin - comes in response to the new programme 1,000 men and me: The Bonnie Blue story.\nThe show features Blue gearing up to have sex with 1,057 men in the space of just 12 hours.\nThe infamous sex worker, 26, has made headlines for her extreme sex stunts and controversial language - such as bragging about taking the virginities of 'barely legal' 18-year-olds.\nHer documentary includes footage of her in a classroom getting ready to film an orgy with a group of models posed as schoolchildren. The performers accepted they had been selected for the role because they look young enough to still be at school.\nThe show was condemned by the children's commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, for 'glamorising and normalising' extreme forms of pornography.\nLady Bertin said she will lodge amendments to the crime and policing bill this autumn, making it illegal for online platforms to show content that could promote child sexual abuse. This would include pornography filmed by adults dressed as children.\nBonnie Blue's Channel 4 documentary 1,000 men and me: The Bonnie Blue story has been criticised for 'glamorising' extreme pornography\nSome companies have stated they don't want their products associated with the adult content star\nThe proposed ban by the independent pornography taskforce - set up in July by Conservative peer Gabby Bertin (pictured) - comes in response to the new programme 1,000 men and me: The Bonnie Blue story\nOfcom was charged with monitoring whether adult content sites are protecting UK viewers from encountering illegal material featuring child sex abuse by the Online Safety Act.\nHowever, forms of damaging porn that are regulated offline (such as in cinemas) are not subjected to the same restrictions online - meaning adults dressed as children to mimic child sexual abuse is not prohibited online.\nChannel 4 has faced immense criticism for promoting Blue's brand, and for failing to properly challenge her claim that her sexual activity is safe.\nSmirnoff and Visa are two in a string of businesses to have pulled online adverts from streaming of the documentary.\nDe Souza previously slammed the programme for 'glamorising and normalising' extreme porn.\nDe Souza said: 'For years we have been fighting to protect our children from the kind of degrading, violent sex that exists freely on their social media feeds. Now this documentary risks taking us a step back by glamorising, even normalising the things young people tell me are frightening.\n'Bonnie Blue's content showcases violence against women as entertainment and allows sexist ideas that women are 'lesser' than men to go unchecked.'\nThe programme did not pixelate any nudity and included clips from Bonnie Blue's stunt including a snippet of the star having sex with three men at the same time\nThe shocking programme followed Bonnie Blue, real name Tia Bellinger, as she geared up to complete her goal of having sex with 1,000 men in 12 hours\nVodka brand Smirnoff, which is owned by drinks company Diego, said the programme was not in line with their advertising guidelines and company values (File image)\nBrands including Cawston Press have told Channel 4 they did not want their products associated with the controversial content (File image)\nLady Bertin said Blue's programme could be on the agenda at the taskforce's next meeting.\n'She has become extremely successful; she is an adult and it is consensual, so it may not be harming her, but it has potentially harmful effects on people who think that this is a normal way to behave,' she said.\n'We should be asking more about the men who arrive with balaclavas on their head to have sex with her.'\nA Channel 4 spokesperson said: 'The film looks at how Bonnie Blue has gained worldwide attention and earned millions of pounds in the last year, exploring changing attitudes to sex, success, porn and feminism in an ever-evolving online world.\n'Director Victoria Silver puts a number of challenges to Bonnie throughout the documentary on the example she sets and how she is perceived, and the film clearly lays bare the tactics and strategies she uses, with the audience purposefully left to form their own opinions.'"

Despite facing backlash for her extreme content and claims of faking her record, she insists her work is supported by her family and has allowed her to achieve financial success, including purchasing a $500,000 Ferrari. Bonnie's provocative actions have sparked discussions about the implications of adult content and its normalization in society.",
