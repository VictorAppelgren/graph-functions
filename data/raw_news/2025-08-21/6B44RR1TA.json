Today and tomorrow will be no exception,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAs the storm moves past New Jersey over the next 24 hours, we are expecting high surf and rip currents, coastal and flash flooding, and a high erosion risk in parts of the state. We ask all New Jerseyans to monitor local weather forecasts and warnings and stay informed on evacuation protocols, especially if you\u2019re down the Shore.\u201d\nFind out what's happening in Across New Jerseyfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nMurphy encouraged residents to visit ready.nj.gov for important weather updates and safety information.

A High Surf Advisory and High Rip Current Risk are in place along the Jersey Shore through Friday. A Wind Advisory is in place for coastal zones from Ocean County south.

The greatest threat of flooding is in Cape May (see below graphic).\nThe greatest flooding impacts will occur with Thursday evening's high tide.

Breaking waves in the surf zone could reach 7 to 12 feet Thursday and up to 17 feet in the open seas, and significant beach erosion is also expected, National Weather Service forecasters said. You can see beach conditions via NJ Beach Cams.\nErin will be moving out to sea, but many of the threats associated with the storm will linger.\n\u201cEven as Erin pushes out into the open Atlantic, dangerous conditions are expected at many beaches heading into the weekend,\" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\nFriday will see dangerous beach conditions, but conditions will be sunny and warm, according to the National Weather Service.
