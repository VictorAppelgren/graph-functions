  "description": "'Sweet Magnolias' fans don't want to think about the show coming to an end, but does the season 5 finale set things up just in case the show isn't renewed?",
  "content": "Sweet Magnolias fans don\u2019t want to think about the show coming to an end, but does the season 5 finale set things up just in case the show isn\u2019t renewed?\n\nDuring an exclusive interview with Us Weekly while promoting Hallmark\u2019s Providence Falls, JoAnna Garc\u00eda Swisher teased how season 5 wraps up the story, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s written as the end by any stretch of the imagination. But we\u2019ve also gotten to be here for five seasons and tell an incredible story.\u201d\n\nSwisher, 45, remained hopeful that there would be more to come.\n\n\u201cWe would continue to keep it going if all of the chips fall in that way,\u201d she noted. \u201cI think everybody would be excited and eager to do that. But if this is it for us, we have no control over it except we are just trying to do what we think our fans will like and enjoy. [With season 4], we almost had to burn it down [with Bill\u2019s death] for that fresh start. And this season, you really get that. With that comes exciting and new ventures, possibilities and relationships. It\u2019s twisty and turny \u2014 that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nBased on Sherryl Woods\u2019 novels, Sweet Magnolias tells the story of three women who have been best friends since childhood as they navigate their romantic lives, careers and growing families. While Season 5, which is currently in production, picks up after Chris Klein\u2018s controversial character, Bill, was killed off, Swisher promised that \u201cno one dies\u201d in the next season.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s extremely dramatic,\u201d Swisher teased to Us. \u201cIt\u2019s a roller-coaster \u2014 as it always is \u2014 but I think this is the first season in a really long time that fans are gonna get those butterflies again.\u201d\n\nThe actress, who has played Maddie since the show premiered in 2020, expressed her excitement for viewers to see what the hit Netflix series has in store.\n\n\u201cThere are some fresh faces that are joining our cast in really unique and fun ways,\u201d she teased. \u201cThe Magnolias are seeing new possibilities on the horizon that are going to only expand our world.\u201d\n\nWhile previewing season 5, Swisher weighed in on some hot topics \u2014 like if Maddie could be headed for a pregnancy story line in the near future.\n\n\u201cI actually just talked about this yesterday with Justin [Bruening] because I\u2019m like, \u2018We never got a honeymoon.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that will involve a little bun in the oven \u2014 or at least an opportunity,\u201d Swisher said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s really been really sweet to see Cal step into this father role and Cal is knocking it out of the park.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I do get pregnant. I hope it\u2019s during the winter in Serenity, because it\u2019s really hot right now. But I\u2019m up for the journey.\u201d\n\nSwisher isn\u2019t just working on the next season of Sweet Magnolias. She is also an executive producer on Hallmark\u2019s three-part Providence Falls film series, starring Katie Stevens, Lachlan Quarmby and Evan Roderick, based on the book series by Jude Deveraux set in 1844 Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe filmed in order and we knew where we were gonna end up,\u201d she told Us. \u201cWe are all bubbling with ways to continue these stories.\u201d\n\nProvidence Falls returns to Lifetime with Providence Falls: An Impossible Promise premieres on Saturday, August 9, and Providence Falls: Thief of Fate on Saturday, August 16, both at 8 p.m. ET.",

      "text": "Since Tracker premiered on CBS, Justin Hartley has taken it upon himself to remind viewers that his character Colter Shaw can \u2014 and will \u2014 die.\nBased on Jeffery Deaver\u2018s novel The Never Game, Tracker centers around a survivalist named Colter who travels the country helping find missing people (or sometimes dogs) and solving cases others wouldn\u2019t. As the series unfolds, viewers learn more about how Colter\u2019s past shaped his current life as a lone wolf.\nHartley not only stars on the show, but he also serves as an executive producer alongside This Is Us producer and director Ken Olin. His role behind the scenes has allowed Hartley to surprise fans with exciting guest stars \u2014 but it has also kept the actor grounded about where the show will go.\n\u201cI just love that when you watch a show like that and you tune into season 1 and then you tune into the last season, you see the development of the character and you go, \u2018Wait a minute, are they playing different roles?\u2019 But then if you watch it throughout the years, you experience those things with the characters,\u201d he told TV Insider in September 2024. \u201cAs competent and confident as Colter is, I don\u2019t at all think for a second that he doesn\u2019t have a ton to learn, especially about himself and his family and all that.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cGoing forward, I think that will be how the show lives on a long runway, is that we keep developing this character and he becomes better at what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s a restless man, and for an audience member, at least shows that I love to watch, you love to see that growth of a character and we have that.\u201d\nIn addition to showing Us Colter\u2019s growth, Hartley warned that the character isn\u2019t immortal. He even hinted that the fan-favorite lead could die as the remainder of the Tracker cast faces shakeups.\nKeep scrolling for Hartley\u2019s most candid quotes about Colter\u2019s mortality:\nA Realistic Portrayal\n\u201cYou start to see all the layers of this guy, peeled back little by little as to why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing. Why he\u2019s going about his business the way he does and why it means so much to him. I wondered why there is not more of this,\u201d Hartley told The Hollywood Reporter in February 2024. \u201cHe is not a superhero \u2014 he\u2019s living a very dangerous life. If he gets shot, he bleeds, he will die.\u201d\nHartley compared it to the Rockford Files, adding, \u201cWe just don\u2019t have that anymore and I get nostalgic about that kind of television. And I\u2019m thinking, what if we had an old-school show with a modern edge to it? And I think the character is awesome.\u201d\nNo One Is Safe\nAccording to Hartley, Tracker isn\u2019t afraid to take big risks with Colter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep upping the stakes. I like being Colter as a hero, finding people and all that. I also really like seeing him in a suspenseful thriller and a dangerous situation,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter in April 2025. \u201cI don\u2019t want our audience to forget that this man is mortal, he\u2019s not a superhero. He can die! The things he is doing are very very dangerous.\u201d\nKeeping Colter Grounded\nHartley explained to CBS Mornings in May 2025 why he likes Colter being a \u201chero\u201d but not necessarily a \u201csuperhero.\u201d\n\u201cI think one of the things that people connect with is he\u2019s vulnerable, like, he can get injured,\u201d Hartley shared. \u201cAnd I think when you put a cape on \u2026 it loses a bit of that. You see him kind of fall apart in a way that you wouldn\u2019t expect. He is way in over his head and he hears this information and he gets overwhelmed and he kind of crumbles a little bit.\u201d\nAffecting the Writing\nThat same month, executive producer Elwood Reid spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about Colter\u2019s future.\n\u201c[Justin] says it all the time. Colter is not Superman and that goes hand in hand with the physical element of it, but then there\u2019s also the emotional thing that gets to him,\u201d he noted. \u201cAs long as I continue to remind ourselves as the writers that he\u2019s human, he can die, he can get hurt \u2014 it\u2019s fun.\u201d\nReid continued: \u201cJustin is always pitching an episode where Colter is almost dead in the middle of the show and we go back. He\u2019s got all kinds of crazy ideas, but I think that\u2019s what makes the show fun, because the minute Colter becomes like Superman, then he\u2019s out. That\u2019s not what Justin wants to play and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what the character is.\u201d"

      "text": "Grab your margaritas and pour one out, because Sweet Magnolias showrunner Sheryl J. Anderson is breaking down the Netflix hit\u2019s most explosive season yet.\nAfter premiering in 2020, Sweet Magnolias spent three seasons covering a mere few months\u2019 time for the citizens of small town Serenity, South Carolina. That all changed with the release of season 4 \u2014 which hit Netflix on Thursday, February 6 \u2014 when viewers caught up with BFFs Maddie (JoAnna Garcia Swisher), Helen (Heather Headley) and Dana Sue (Brooke Elliott) more than one year after the events of season 3 came to a close.\n\u201cIt freed up how we were telling our stories,\u201d Anderson exclusively told Us Weekly of the choice to leap ahead for the show\u2019s fourth season. \u201cThere are 34 minutes between season 1 and season 2 and two hours and 34 minutes between season 2 and season 3. We talked a long time about how big a jump we would take, but we wanted to [do something different].\u201d\nWarning: spoilers below for season 4 of Sweet Magnolias.\nTime moving forward, of course, meant big changes happening off screen for the Magnolias and their inner circles: Maddie and Cal (Justin Bruening) went and got engaged, Helen and Eric (Dion Johnstone) found new love \u2013 and not with each other \u2014 and Dana Sue gave up active control of her restaurant, Sullivan\u2019s, in lieu of teaching students how to cook. Annie (Anneliese Judge), meanwhile, began her senior year of high school while Ty (Carson Rowland) explored his future as a musician.\nFans only have brief moments to catch up with what\u2019s evolved for the characters off screen, however, before the new season jumps into a slew of new twists by the end of episode 1.\n\u201cEpisode 1 is full of surprises,\u201d Anderson teased. \u201cWe wanted to surprise the audience and allow them to recalibrate along with us as we are continuing this journey. We just thought it was interesting and reset some of the story lines in a way that we could come into them more vigorously.\u201d\nSeason 4 is certainly a vigorous season \u2014 one that takes off running and doesn\u2019t stop until the credits roll in the finale. Keep scrolling for Anderson\u2019s break down all of season 4\u2019s biggest bombshells:\nWhy Did They \u2018Kill Bill\u2019?\nIt\u2019s revealed early on in season 4 that Bill (Chris Klein) died of a heart attack while living in Texas with his parents and new girlfriend, Kathy (Wynn Everett). When asked why Bill\u2019s death was necessary in moving the story forward, the showrunner pointed out how connected Bill was to Serenity as the ex-husband of Maddie, father of Kyle (Logan Allen), Ty and Katie (Ella Grace Helton), ex-fianc\u00e9 of Noreen (Jamie Lynn Spears), estranged father of Bex and biological father of Issac (Chris Medlin). Whew!\n\u201cI prefer to think of it as Bill\u2019s untimely passing. Not that we killed off Bill,\u201d Anderson quipped to Us before confessing there were \u201cplenty of \u2018Kill Bill\u2019 jokes\u201d on set. \u201cBut the reason [he died] is we were looking for a cataclysmic event that would strike everybody at the core of their being. And across his time in Serenity, [Bill] has been central, obviously to Maddie and the kids but also to the group of friends around them [and] to other people in town.\u201d\nAnderson noted that Bill and Kathy ultimately found their \u201chappy conclusion\u201d during the season 3 finale \u2014 when they sought forgiveness before leaving town indefinitely \u2014 leaving an open space for something \u201ccompletely unexpected\u201d to happen.\n\u201cWe were also looking for a way to have our characters confront those really existential questions that erupt when the first person in your friend group passes,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like, \u2018Who am I? Could time run out for me tomorrow? And if it does, what\u2019s my legacy? Have I spent my time wisely? Am I doing what I should be doing? Am I with the person I truly love? Bill was such a shock. What if another shock is coming? Should I change my life?\u2019\u201d\nAnderson clarified, however, that the writers and the cast all \u201clove\u201d Klein as an actor, sharing that they were collectively \u201dso sorry to tell him, \u2018We\u2019re taking this direction, but we love you.\u2019\u201d\nWhy Did Maddie Keep Her Wedding a Secret From the Magnolias?\n\u201cWe wanted to make it a family project,\u201d Anderson explained to Us of Maddie hiding her wedding from her two best friends. \u201cAnd Maddie shares with Dana Sue and Helen that she and Cal let the kids help them plan. So it was, \u2018Let\u2019s make it fun, let\u2019s make it splashy, let\u2019s make it so unusual that, you know, [we may] go on [for] many, many seasons and have many, many weddings, [but] there will never be a wedding like Cal and Maddie\u2019s!\u2019\u201d\nCal nd Maddie tied the knot in a surprise ceremony on Halloween night during episode 2. While Maddie\u2019s kids were let in on the secret, even Dana Sue and Helen are kept in the dark \u2014 a choice Anderson thought would cultivate an \u201cinteresting conversation for friends to have\u201d after the deed is done.\nWhile Dana Sue and Helen weren\u2019t angry with Maddie, they did share their disappointment the following day. Garcia, for her part, called the experience a \u201cbig lesson\u201d that Maddie needed to \u201clearn.\u201d\n\u201cLook, at the end of the day, if you need a body buried I would go to Maddie because she is gonna keep her lips sealed,\u201d Garcia Fisher said, noting that she\u2019s a lot like Maddie in that way. \u201cLike, when people say, \u2018I have that one person that I tell the secret to,\u2019 well I hold secrets like a lockbox. I\u2019m a lockbox secret girl.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cI never realized that and I\u2019ve always prided myself on that, but I\u2019ve never realized that that could hurt people\u2019s feelings. So when Helen said, \u2018Yeah, you keep secrets but not from us.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, I get it.\u2019\u201d\nGarcia Fisher added that while she was \u201csurprised\u201d Maddie didn\u2019t let her friends in on the planning, she also understood the decision. \u201cIt was like a fun surprise,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I would\u2019ve felt really shafted as a friend. So I think they let [Maddie] off the hook a little easier than I would\u2019ve. I would\u2019ve been mad.\u201d\nMaddie\u2019s second big secret of the season\u2014 that she knew Bill was Isaac\u2019s biological father \u2014 felt like a secret she did need to keep. \u201cThere are grades,\u201d Garcia Fisher argued, noting that some secrets \u201cwe just keep to ourselves,\u201d even if it is \u201ctop tier gossip.\u201d\nBreaking Down the \u2018Slap\u2019 Heard Around Serenity\nThe tension between Bill\u2019s mom, Bonnie, and Maddie reached a fever pitch in season 4 after Bonnie screamed at Ty the night of Bill\u2019s funeral. When Maddie called Bonnie \u201cvain\u201d for her behavior, Bonnie attempted to slap Maddie across the face \u2014 but Maddie caught her wrist just in time.\nAccording to Anderson, it was important Bonnie never actually made contact when going to hit Maddie. \u201cFrom the original pitch of the moment there was not full contact, because this is Maddie taking control of the relationship,\u201d she explained to Us. \u201cMaddie tried so hard to be the daughter-in-law that Bonnie expected and therefore Bill expected. And it was a struggle from the get go.\u201d\nThe moment, Anderson said, led to the \u201crevelation\u201d that Bonnie revealed before leaving Serenity \u2014 that Bill secretly stood up for his ex-wife while they were still married.\n\u201cWe thought that spoke to the complexity of their marriage and how no matter how old we are, a lot of us are still trying to fulfill parental expectations,\u201d Anderson told Us. \u201cSome relationships can bear that and some can\u2019t. But Bill\u2019s a very particular kind of guy, and was raised [with someone saying], \u2018You deserve whatever you want.\u2019 So we just spent some time thinking about what kind of parents raise a kid that way. And that\u2019s how we came up with Bonnie and [his dad] Trip.\u201d\nWhy Was Now the Time for Ty and Annie?\nAfter seasons of fans hoped childhood BFFs Ty and Annie would get together, the pair finally kissed and confessed their love during the first episode of season 4. Anderson explained that the pair getting together boiled down to what Ty\u2019s bandmate Olivia (Tommi Rose) told him before heading out on tour.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna go out on the road, and if you continue to mess around and take her for granted, if you stay quiet and we come back and she\u2019s with somebody else, it\u2019s on you,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAnd having recognized that he kind of blew it, and she started dating Jackson (Sam Ashby) [in season 2], the wheels start turning and he is like, \u2018I better say something!\u2019\u201d\nWhat Happened Between Ty and Annie During the Year Time Jump?\nAnderson told Us that Ty and Annie were simply in a holding pattern for the year viewers didn\u2019t see them on screen, focusing on their bond as friends.\n\u201cIt\u2019s,\u2018We\u2019re just gonna be friends forever.\u2019 So they weren\u2019t pursuing each other,\u2019\u201d she said, before noting that them \u201cholding hands\u201d at the vow renewal during the season 3 finale was \u201ca moment of mutual support\u201d more than anything.\nWill Ty and Annie Be Able to Make It Work?\nWhile Ty and Annie started season 4 on cloud nine as a couple, things took a turn when Ty returned from tour in the finale, revealing that his band was asked to tour Europe for the summer and fall \u2014 and he wanted Annie to defer her acceptance to her dream college to go with him. Annie, for her part, declined the offer, telling Ty that they should be able to survive one year apart after taking 17 years to admit their love.\nThe pair end the season as one of the only cliffhangers \u2014 and Anderson told Us that Annie\u2019s decision played into season 4\u2019s overall theme.\n\u201cOne of the great heartbreaks of being in love at that age is that you\u2019re at different levels of emotional maturity and what seems like a clear path to him is not a clear path to her,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd frankly, one of the things that we were touching on this season is how often women are expected to put aside their dreams. Annie, Dana Sue, Maddie, Helen \u2014 I mean, you know, the sacrifice is somehow supposed to come to us naturally. And that was one of the things that we wanted to explore.\u201d\nAnderson noted that Annie is such a \u201csupportive\u201d and \u201cgiving\u201d character, so forcing her to \u201cstand up against the guy she\u2019s been in love with all her life and say, \u2018I have my plans,\u2019 we just thought was an important conversation for a couple of any age to have, but certainly at their age.\u201d\nAs for Judge, she\u2019s not sure if the duo will make it in the end \u2014 but she hopes they will.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be really interested to see if we\u2019re renewed for another season, which I\u2019m crossing my fingers [we will be],\u201d she said. \u201cThe cliffhanger, it\u2019s there for me. I feel like I\u2019m right alongside the viewers. Like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen.\u2019 Like, I don\u2019t know if Ty\u2019s gonna realize that that was not the right way to approach that conversation. Because it came from a good place. He wanted her to go with him. He wanted to for the world with her. I get it, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s so hard. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\nAre Kids in the Cards for Helen and Eric?\nWhile season 4 began with Helen and Eric each respectively dating other people, the pair finally found their way back together during a hurricane \u2014 after a dripping wet Eric saved Helen from being crushed by a tree, of course. The twosome spent most of the season in bliss before Eric popped the question on Christmas Eve, but will the newly engaged couple fulfill Helen\u2019s dreams of having children after her miscarriage, and Eric losing his wife and baby?\n\u201cI would love to have a season 5 to answer that question,\u201d Anderson told Us with a laugh when asked if adoption may be in the cards for the couple. \u201cBut to where they are here in season 4, it\u2019s really important for couples to have at least begun conversations on those big issues before they get engaged. I mean, ideally and certainly before they get married.\u201d\nHelen and Eric did have a \u201cdelicate\u201d conversation \u201ccircling around\u201d about possibly expanding their family in the penultimate episode of season 4, which Anderson said is \u201creally interesting for Helen, who had already been struggling with fertility issues to expand the definition of what it would mean to have children.\u201d\nCan \u2018Sweet Magnolias\u2019 Go on With Maddie in NYC?\nDespite finding massive success as a children\u2019s book author during the time jump, season 4 concluded with Maddie accepting a marketing job at a publishing house in New York City. While she\u2019s hesitant to leave, her family and friends encourage her to take the leap \u2014 and Garcia Fisher is in full agreement that getting out of Serenity is the right way to go.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to get out of the bubble a little bit and test the waters,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s sort of a whole part of Maddie\u2019s journey. \u201cShe was living this one life for so long and doing it really capably, but it backfired, it blew up. And she really dedicated herself so wholeheartedly to be this wife and this mother and it\u2019s not really all that noble. It was a huge lesson for her where she was like, \u2018You know, I definitely sacrificed myself and who I was and experiencing great love and all of those kind of things.\u2019\u201d\nGarcia Fisher called Maddie\u2019s move a \u201ccool angle to explore\u201d for the character, especially since it hasn\u2019t been that long since Bill and Maddie actually divorced.\n\u201cIt feels like a long time because Sweet Magnolias has been around for a while. but when you really look at the timestamp of our show, it\u2019s pretty rapid fire,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable that she\u2019s gotta get her groove back. And a part of that is reconnecting with her roots and the things that she\u2019s good at and the things that she dedicated herself to at one point in her life. So I love the idea of it.\u201d\nBut could Sweet Magnolias continue with Maddie in Manhattan? Garcia Fisher certainly thinks so. \u201cI think that it\u2019s safe to say that no matter where Maddie is, where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way,\u201d she told Us, adding, \u201cI think it\u2019d be really cool to see the Magnolias in Central Park strolling around like the Southern Sex and the City gals.\u201d"

      "text": "JoAnna Garc\u00eda Swisher\u2018s character Maddie has come a long way on Sweet Magnolias \u2014 but could a pregnancy story line be in her future?\n\u201cI actually just talked about this yesterday with Justin [Bruening] because I\u2019m like, \u2018We never got a honeymoon.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that will involve a little bun in the oven \u2014 or at least an opportunity,\u201d Swisher, 45, teased during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly while promoting her partnership with Ziploc. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s really been really sweet to see Cal step into this father role and Cal is knocking it out of the park.\u201d\nSwisher continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I do get pregnant. I hope it\u2019s during the winter in Serenity, because it\u2019s really hot right now. But I\u2019m up for the journey.\u201d\nWhen Sweet Magnolias premiered in 2020, Maddie was navigating a divorce and adjusting to life as a single mom of three. Fast forward five seasons, and she\u2019s married to Cal (Bruening) and making big moves in her career after accepting a job in New York City.\n\u201cSomeone had mentioned something about people who were not happy that Maddie took a job in New York City,\u201d Swisher said of the surprising fan reaction. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s look into that. Let\u2019s kind of dive into that, because it\u2019ll help me as I navigate Maddie in season 5.\u2019\u201d\nWhile preparing to film season 5, Swisher took viewer response to heart.\n\u201dIt\u2019s really all about just expanding and contracting. That\u2019s what life is. Just because we got the man or we have the kids at home, we\u2019re still vital, living, breathing people. Our dreams don\u2019t end when we just get to one destination,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that I\u2019m really leaning into.\u201d\nThe actress told Us that she\u2019s hoping people keep an open mind about the onscreen changes.\n\u201cFor so long, Maddie had dedicated her life to her family, and then that got turned upside down when Bill and Noreen got together, and then she met Cal. So much has happened for her in such a short period of time,\u201d Swisher continued. \u201cSo to get this opportunity to flex her muscles and be in a big city and feel that energy, I know it was triggering for people. But for me, I leaned into it and I really likened it to how I feel very lucky that I have a husband and kids that are supportive of my dreams and my career. They\u2019re always along for the ride and they\u2019re always ready to support.\u201d\nSwisher went on to preview season 5, teasing to Us, \u201cIt is very exciting, this season. We are all over the place. It\u2019s taking us a little bit longer to complete a season because we\u2019ve gotten the opportunity to travel.\u201d\nShe concluded: \u201cActually, last night we were shooting at the baseball field and I was looking around, and we have a lot of new cast members. There\u2019s these new faces in Serenity, South Carolina, that are so exciting for me. I get to direct two episodes this year and I\u2019m prepping that right now. I get these incredible moments with the heart and soul of our show \u2014 our Magnolias \u2014 and the kids on our show. But there\u2019s new, fresh blood and energy in Serenity.\u201d\nWhile Swisher continues to film season 5, she is using the time to partner up with Ziploc to help show families across North America that food preservation doesn\u2019t have to be complicated by sharing fresh tips for a smarter lunch routine.\n\u201cZiploc is very much a part of our daily lives, and it was really fun. We care a lot about food waste in our family. We talk about that a lot. I was really excited to share the ways that we try to minimize food waste in our lives,\u201d JoAnna, who shares two daughters with husband Nick Swisher, explained. \u201cMy kids are getting older and they have a lot of opinions about their lunches. All of that is really centered around our Ziploc bags.\u201d\nJoAnna broke down her approach, adding, \u201cWe create these little prep stations so we have just little ways to make life a little easier in the morning. Then I don\u2019t open up a lunchbox at the end of the day that is filled with food. I\u2019m always looking for ways to make sure that my girls are getting well-balanced, healthy lunches and I love good organization and making things easy, and Ziploc helps with all of those.\u201d\nShe concluded: \u201cEven for me, right now I\u2019m working on season 5 of Sweet Magnolias, and I take a lunchbox to work because I\u2019m always nibbling on things and wanting to have healthy, quick things. I\u2019m always dipping into our little bin of snacks that make grab-and-go easy and help keep things fresher longer. It makes it easy and everything looks good too.\u201d\nSweet Magnolias is streaming on Netflix."

      "text": "The lead prosecutor in the University of Idaho quadrule murder case is sharing his chilling theory on why killer Bryan Kohberger spared a potential fifth victim.\nEarlier this month, Kohberger pleaded guilty to the murders of college students Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin in the early hours of November 13, 2022, at an off-campus student house in Moscow, Idaho. Kohberger, 30, was handed four consecutive life sentences over the murders on July 23. He is expected to serve life in prison.\nFollowing the sentencing, the Moscow Police Department unsealed hundreds of documents related to the case, including a statement by police officer Mitch Nunes, who wrote how surviving roommate Dylan Mortensen described seeing her roommates\u2019 attacker. Nunes said Mortensen \u201cpeeked\u201d out of her second-floor bedroom \u201cand observed a male described as approximately 6-feet tall, slim build, with a black ski mask leave the second-floor patio area.\u201d (Mortensen shared the same floor as Kernodle.)\nIn an interview with The Idaho Statesman published on Wednesday, July 30, Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson said it was highly likely that the assailant saw Mortensen, too, though he didn\u2019t attempt to attack her.\n\u201cFrom what Dylan described, I have a hard time imagining that the killer did not see Dylan,\u201d he said.\nThompson theorized, \u201cAt that point, he\u2019d been in the house probably longer than he planned, and he had killed more people than he planned. \u2026 It wouldn\u2019t surprise us that the killer was scared at that point and decided they had to leave, not knowing if law enforcement already had been called.\u201d\nMortensen delivered an emotional victim impact statement during Kohberger\u2019s sentencing in Boise, Idaho, on July 23.\n\u201cWhat happened that night changed everything,\u201d she said through tears, per CBS News. \u201cBecause of him, four beautiful, genuine, compassionate people were taken from this world for no reason.\u201d\nMortensen continued, \u201cWhat he did shattered me in places I didn\u2019t know could break. I should have been figuring out who I was. I should have been having the college experience and starting to establish my future. Instead, I was forced to learn how to survive the unimaginable.\u201d\nMortensen went on to describe the ongoing psychological effects of that fateful night, revealing that she is terrified of being alone and experiences regular panic attacks.\n\u201cI can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t think, I can\u2019t stop shaking. It\u2019s far beyond anxiety. It\u2019s my body reliving everything over and over again. My nervous system never got the message that it is over, and it won\u2019t let me forget what he did to them,\u201d she said.\nMortensen described Kohberger as a \u201chollow vessel, something less than human, a body without empathy, without remorse.\u201d She added, \u201cHe chose destruction. He chose evil. He feels nothing. He tried to take everything from me: my friends, my safety, my identity, my future.\u201d\nA second surviving roommate, Bethany Funke, also wrote a statement that was read out by a friend. Funke described her guilt at not realizing what had happened sooner.\n\u201cI still carry so much regret and guilt for not knowing what happened and not calling [911] right away even though I understand it wouldn\u2019t have changed anything, not even if the paramedics had been right outside the door,\u201d she said, per CBS News and E!

Season 5, currently in production, will pick up after Chris Klein\u2018s controversial character Bill was killed off.\n\u201cI prefer to think of it as Bill\u2019s untimely passing. Not that we killed off Bill,\u201d creator Sheryl J. Anderson quipped to Us in February. \u201cBut the reason [he died] is we were looking for a cataclysmic event that would strike everybody at the core of their being. And across his time in Serenity, [Bill] has been central, obviously to Maddie and the kids but also to the group of friends around them [and] to other people in town.\u201d\nAnderson noted that Bill and Kathy (Wynn Everett) ultimately found their \u201chappy conclusion\u201d during the season 3 finale.\n\u201cWe were also looking for a way to have our characters confront those really existential questions that erupt when the first person in your friend group passes,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like, \u2018Who am I? Could time run out for me tomorrow? And if it does, what\u2019s my legacy? Have I spent my time wisely? Am I doing what I should be doing? Am I with the person I truly love? Bill was such a shock. What if another shock is coming? Should I change my life?\u2019\u201d\nAnderson clarified, however, that the writers and the cast all \u201clove\u201d Klein as an actor, sharing that they were collectively \u201dso sorry to tell him, \u2018We\u2019re taking this direction, but we love you.\u2019\u201d\nIn addition to a new cast, Swisher previously explained what else led to a season 5 delay.\n\u201cIt is very exciting this season. We are all over the place. It\u2019s taking us a little bit longer to complete a season because we\u2019ve gotten the opportunity to travel,\u201d she shared with Us. \u201cActually, last night we were shooting at the baseball field and I was looking around, and we have a lot of new cast members.

      "text": "Justin Hartley\u2018s Tracker costars have often spoken about their experiences working with him before the hit CBS series lost three cast members ahead of season 3.\nAfter becoming a household name with roles in Passions, Smallville, The Young and the Restless and This Is Us, Hartley scored a major career success with Tracker. The show, which premiered in February 2024, was coined the most-watched broadcast premiere since NCIS\u2018 final episode with Mark Harmon in September 2021. Its average viewership was reported to be 18.2 million per episode.\nHartley, for his part, received praise for his work as the star of the show. Meanwhile, his role as an executive producer on the show allowed him to bring in some familiar faces for guest star roles, including Sofia Pernas, Jensen Ackles, Melissa Roxburgh, Jennifer Morrison and more.\nDespite Tracker quickly becoming the show many wanted to join, it also made headlines when Robin Weigert, Abby McEnany and Eric Graise all exited the show before season 3. Executive producer Elwood Reid previously defended the onscreen reconfiguration during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the show to be phone-a-friend every week. I think that gets old, and Justin is always challenging me on that. He\u2019s like, \u2018Do we need to do this? Do I need to call Bobby all the time? Can I do this?'\u201d Reid shared in May 2025. \u201cYou don\u2019t [always] see Reenie. He talks to Velma for two seconds. He may talk to Bobby for one phone call. The show works because you are over Justin\u2019s shoulder.\u201d\nLuckily, Hartley has received nothing but praise and support from those who continue to appear on Tracker. Keep scrolling for everything various Tracker guest stars have said about working with Hartley before those cast exits:\nJensen Ackles\nThe Supernatural alum has returned to Tracker every season since being cast as Hartley\u2019s onscreen brother.\n\u201cI\u2019m playing the older brother of somebody that I know very well, and I get along with very well. I mean, Justin and I have known each other for over 20 years, and we\u2019ve been buds and we\u2019ve never gotten to work together,\u201d Ackles told TV Insider in July 2025. \u201cSo it was really fun for us to get on set. But it was also very easy because it\u2019s just hanging out with your buddy and we get to have fun and we get to mix it up.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice that he\u2019s an executive producer on it so he can be like, \u2018Do you like that word? Do you like that line?\u2019 Just change it, whatever you want.\u2019 So it kind gives us a little freedom.\u201d\nMelissa Roxburgh\nSpeaking of fictional siblings, Roxburgh has rounded out the Shaw family as Hartley\u2019s sister on the show.\n\u201cJustin is great. It\u2019s such a lovely and warm set [because] Justin does such a good job of making it that way,\u201d she told Us in February 2025. \u201cSo I\u2019d love to go back. Justin is a friend and it\u2019s nice to play with your friends and I love the show, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nFiona Rene\nAs the last remaining main cast member alongside Hartley, Rene has praised her costar for his hard work.\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a phenomenal No. 1 [on the call sheet]. He wears so many hats [on set]. Not only is he an actor, but [he is focused on] the numbers of the show,\u201d Rene told Us in November 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s important to him as well as a producer. When he comes on set, he\u2019s all about business and we even call him the Terminator.\u201d\nRene spoke highly of Hartley\u2019s process on set.\n\u201cBut then he takes off that hat, he puts on his actor hat and he genuinely plays. It\u2019s such a dream for an actor to be able to come on set and work together to find what feels right between their characters,\u201d she added. \u201cJustin is always up for that. And for someone wearing so many hats, to be able to let all of that go and play in that moment is honestly the dream. I hope I can do the same.\u201d\nJennifer Morrison\nMorrison was thrilled to reunite with Hartley after their time on This Is Us, telling Closer in November 2024, \u201cI think it was Justin\u2019s idea. We had a great time working on This Is Us. We just got along so great. What I\u2019m constantly looking for in this industry is to spend time on set with people I really care about, respect and admire. Justin is one of those people.\u201d\nJon Huertas\nHuertas, who has only appeared behind the scenes as a director, had similar feelings about Hartley.\n\u201cBecause Justin and I had this history together, it was like we just fell in lockstep again from when I directed him on This Is Us [and] when we worked together in scenes as stepfather and stepson,\u201d Huertas shared with Us in April 2024. \u201cWe fell into that rhythm so naturally that it was easy. It made it really easy.\u201d\nHuertas was thrilled to be reunited with Hartley after This Is Us.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I love about working with people that I\u2019ve worked with before and working with friends. In fact, Diana [Maria Riva], who worked with Justin in this episode, she and I have known each other for a long time,\u201d he noted. \u201cSo having a rapport with people really makes the process much easier and smoother. And because TV moves so fast, I like that. I like working with people that I know.\u201d\nSofia Pernas\n\u201cWe get asked all the time, like, \u2018You guys don\u2019t take a break from each other?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I love him.\u2019 Thankfully that\u2019s reciprocated because how often do you get that?\u201d Pernas, who has been married to Hartley since 2021, told People in March 2024 after joining Tracker as her husband\u2019s onscreen love interest. \u201cI\u2019m just really thankful that we both feel that way about each other and that we\u2019re able to take that to work and not need extended breaks from each other because we\u2019re so absorbed.\u201d\nLachlan Quarmby\nDuring an exclusive interview with Us, Hallmark\u2019s Lachlan Quarmby recalled his guest appearance in season 1, sharing in August 2025, \u201cJustin is awesome. He\u2019s straight in there. He\u2019s a real captain of that ship. That was a great time.\u201d\nQuarmby walked away from the hit CBS series with a very positive experience.\n\u201cI got to do an Australian accent. I was told when I was at acting school in Australia that I\u2019d never play a surfer since I just don\u2019t have the look. And I got to play a surfer in Vancouver, who was Australian,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat was so fun.\u201d"

      "text": "Fans are anxiously awaiting for season 5 of Sweet Magnolias \u2014 but will any of their favorites be missing when the show finally does return?\nFirst things first, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, who has played Maddie since season 1, gave Us insight into why there might be a delay on the arrival of the return to Serenity.\n\u201cIt is very exciting this season. We are all over the place. It\u2019s taking us a little bit longer to complete a season because we\u2019ve gotten the opportunity to travel,\u201d she exclusively told Us Weekly in July 2025. \u201cActually, last night we were shooting at the baseball field and I was looking around, and we have a lot of new cast members. There\u2019s these new faces in Serenity, South Carolina, that are so exciting for me. \u2026 There\u2019s new, fresh blood and energy in Serenity.\u201d\nSweet Magnolias, which premiered in 2020, is based on Sherryl Woods\u2019 novels about three women who have been best friends since childhood as they navigate their romantic lives, careers and family. Season 4 ended with surprising moves, breakups, engagements and even a major death, which has made Netflix viewers curious about where the show goes next.\nKeep scrolling to see which characters are coming back \u2014 and which aren\u2019t:\nJoAnna Garcia Swisher\nDuring her interview with Us, Swisher teased Maddie\u2019s big move to New York City.\n\u201cSomeone had mentioned something about people who were not happy that Maddie took a job in New York City. And I was like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s look into that. Let\u2019s kind of dive into that because it\u2019ll help me as I navigate Maddie in season 5,\u2019\u201d she recalled about the divisive story line. \u201dIt\u2019s really all about just expanding and contracting. That\u2019s what life is. Just because we got the man or we have the kids at home, we\u2019re still vital, living, breathing people. Our dreams don\u2019t end when we just get to one destination.\u201d\nSwisher was excited for fans to see how they approached the big change.\n\u201cIt definitely was something that I never thought twice about when I read the scripts. But it was interesting to see the feedback and the way people felt,\u201d she noted. \u201cSo I feel really excited to be able to portray a character that is still flexing her muscles and still dreaming and has an incredibly supportive partner and children. They\u2019re all thriving and everyone\u2019s OK and life is still revealing itself.\u201d\nBrooke Elliott\nElliott has been photographed filming scenes for season 5 as Dana Sue (Elliott) visited Maddie in New York City.\nHeather Headley\nHeadley told TVLine in July 2025 that season 5 will feature Helen (Headley) and Eric (Dion Johnstone) having conversations about possibly expanding their family after getting engaged in season 4.\nLogan Allen\nKyle\u2019s (Allen) story will continue when season 5 returns to Netflix.\nAnneliese Judge\nAfter season 4 saw Annie (Judge) and Ty (Carson Rowland) finally becoming a couple, the season ended with them at odds about their next steps. Judge isn\u2019t losing out hope about where their journey would go from here.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be really interested to see if we\u2019re renewed for another season, which I\u2019m crossing my fingers [we will be],\u201d she exclusively told Us in February 2025. \u201cThe cliffhanger, it\u2019s there for me. I feel like I\u2019m right alongside the viewers. Like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen.\u2019 Like, I don\u2019t know if Ty\u2019s gonna realize that that was not the right way to approach that conversation. Because it came from a good place. He wanted her to go with him. He wanted to for the world with her. I get it, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s so hard. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201d\nCarson Rowland\nTy wasn\u2019t featured as prominently after Rowland and his wife, Maris Kenny, welcomed their first child. But that is expected to change in season 5 with Ty playing a big role amid his relationship issues with Annie.\nJustin Bruening\nSeason 4 hinted that Maddie and Cal (Bruening) could consider expanding their family.\n\u201cI actually just talked about this yesterday with Justin because I\u2019m like, \u2018We never got a honeymoon.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that will involve a little bun in the oven \u2014 or at least an opportunity. But I think it\u2019s really been really sweet to see step into this father role and Cal is knocking it out of the park,\u201d Swisher told Us. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I do get pregnant. I hope it\u2019s during the winter in Serenity because it\u2019s really hot right now. But I\u2019m up for all of the journey.\u201d\nChris Klein\nFollowing four seasons playing Bill, Klein\u2019s character was killed off and will likely not appear in future episodes.\n\u201cBut the reason [he died] is we were looking for a cataclysmic event that would strike everybody at the core of their being,\u201d creator Sheryl J. Anderson told Us in February 2025. \u201cAnd across his time in Serenity, [Bill] has been central, obviously to Maddie and the kids but also to the group of friends around them [and] to other people in town.\u201d\nJamie Lynn Spears\nSpears won Us over as Noreen so hopefully season 5 will show how her story develops after finding love again.\nDion Johnstone\nAnderson teased how Eric and Helen\u2019s romance will grow in season 5, sharing with Us, \u201cIt\u2019s really important for couples to have at least begun conversations on those big issues [like adoption] before they get engaged. I mean, ideally and certainly before they get married.\u201d\nBrandon Quinn\nDana Sue\u2019s family \u2014 including husband Ronnie \u2014 are still an integral part of Sweet Magnolias.\nChris Medlin\nIf Medlin isn\u2019t brought back to Serenity as Isaac, viewers would likely riot so chances are he will be in season 5.\nJamie-Lynn Sigler\nSigler has been cast as Nell Winters, who is a prominent writer Maddie befriends in New York.\nJanice Wesley\nThe actress joined season 5 as Miss Eustice a.k.a a town matron of Serenity.\nCourtney Grace\nGrace is Ronnie\u2019s \u201cnew, hard-charging\u201d business partner Courtney Sinclair in season 5.\nJohn Gabriel Rodriquez\nRodriquez is Clark Bellson, a rival business owner in Serenity who complicates life for the Magnolias.\nAidan Merwarth\nMerwarth has been described as Noah Wharton but not much more information has been released yet.\nAustin Woods\nWoods is Blake Monaghan, who will \u201ccomplicate life for the Mini Magnolias.\u201d\nIman Benson\nErik\u2019s niece, who brings unexpected news to Erik and Helen, is named Jessica."

      "text": "JoAnna Garc\u00eda Swisher revealed why Sweet Magnolias fans will have to wait a little \u201clonger\u201d for season 5.\nDuring an exclusive interview with Us Weekly while promoting her partnership with Ziploc, Swisher, 45, teased what viewers can expect from season 5, saying, \u201cIt is very exciting this season. We are all over the place. It\u2019s taking us a little bit longer to complete a season because we\u2019ve gotten the opportunity to travel.\u201d\nSeason 4 of the hit Netflix series showed Swisher\u2019s character, Maddie, choosing to take a job in New York City \u2014 despite living in South Carolina. But the changes don\u2019t stop there because the characters \u201cdon\u2019t just go\u201d to the Big Apple.\n\u201cActually last night we were shooting at the baseball field, and I was looking around, and we have a lot of new cast members. There\u2019s these new faces in Serenity, South Carolina, that are so exciting for me,\u201d she told Us before news broke about Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Janice Wesley joining the show.\nSwisher is also excited about opportunities taking place behind the scenes, adding, \u201cI get to direct two episodes this year and I\u2019m prepping that right now. I get these incredible moments with the heart and soul of our show \u2014 our Magnolias \u2014 and the kids on our show. But there\u2019s new, fresh blood and energy in Serenity. It just feels exciting. A lot happens this season and our world is getting a little bit bigger.\u201d\nSweet Magnolias, which premiered in 2020, is based on Sherryl Woods\u2019 novels about three women who have been best friends since childhood as they navigate their romantic lives, careers and family.\nIn season 4, Sweet Magnolias introduced some surprising changes, including a shocking character death, Maddie\u2019s move and more. Swisher weighed in on the mixed response to how some of the writing swings will affect the future of the show.\n\u201cSomeone had mentioned something about people who were not happy that Maddie took a job in New York City. And I was like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s look into that. Let\u2019s kind of dive into that because it\u2019ll help me as I navigate Maddie in season 5,\u2019\u201d she noted. \u201dIt\u2019s really all about just expanding and contracting. That\u2019s what life is. Just because we got the man or we have the kids at home, we\u2019re still vital living, breathing people. Our dreams don\u2019t end when we just get to one destination.\u201d\nSwisher defended the way Sweet Magnolias allowed Maddie to aim for more.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part that I\u2019m really leaning into. For so long, Maddie had dedicated her life to her family and then that got turned upside down when Bill and Noreen got together and then she met Cal. So much has happened for her in such a short period of time,\u201d the actress pointed out. \u201cSo to get this opportunity to flex her muscles and be in a big city and feel that energy, I know it was triggering for people. But for me, I leaned into it and I really likened it to how I feel very lucky that I have a husband and kids that are supportive of my dreams and my career. They\u2019re always along for the ride and they\u2019re always ready to support.\u201d\nSwisher continued: \u201cIt definitely was something that I never thought twice about when I read the scripts. But it was interesting to see the feedback and the way people felt. So I feel really excited to be able to portray a character that is still flexing her muscles and still dreaming and has an incredibly supportive partner and children. They\u2019re all thriving and everyone\u2019s OK and life is still revealing itself.\u201d\nWhile Swisher continues to film season 5, she is using the time to partner up with Ziploc to help show families across North America that food preservation doesn\u2019t have to be complicated by sharing fresh tips for a smarter lunch routine.\n\u201cZiploc is very much a part of our daily lives, and it was really fun. We care a lot about food waste in our family. We talk about that a lot. I was really excited to share the ways that we try to minimize food waste in our lives,\u201d JoAnna, who shares two daughters with husband Nick Swisher, explained. \u201cMy kids are getting older and they have a lot of opinions about their lunches. All of that is really centered around our Ziploc bags.\u201d\nJoAnna broke down her approach, adding, \u201cWe create these little prep stations so we have just little ways to make life a little easier in the morning. Then I don\u2019t open up a lunchbox at the end of the day that is filled with food. I\u2019m always looking for ways to make sure that my girls are getting well-balanced, healthy lunches and I love good organization and making things easy, and Ziploc helps with all of those.\u201d\nShe concluded: \u201cEven for me, right now I\u2019m working on season 5 of Sweet Magnolias, and I take a lunchbox to work because I\u2019m always nibbling on things and wanting to have healthy, quick things. I\u2019m always dipping into our little bin of snacks that make grab-and-go easy and help keep things fresher longer. It makes it easy and everything looks good too.\u201d\nSweet Magnolias is streaming on Netflix."
