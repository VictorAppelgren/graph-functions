  "content": "It\u2019s easy to forget, but your AirTag can actually run out of juice, so knowing how to replace your AirTag battery is key. Apple\u2019s trackers are designed to last more than a year on a fresh battery, but you\u2019ll eventually have to swap yours out in order to keep tracking your stuff. And while you might not see an obvious way to open your AirTag just by looking at it, doing so is actually pretty easy.\n\nWhether you\u2019re using AirTags for school, for travel or just to keep tabs on a handful of valuables, the last thing you want is for your tracker to suddenly die at the worst possible moment. Here\u2019s how to swap out your AirTag battery to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nHow to replace your AirTag battery\n\nReplacing your AirTag battery is super simple, though there are a few small quirks you\u2019ll have to keep in mind. Before you get to swapping, remember that AirTags run on a single CR2032 lithium 3-volt (3V) coin battery. These type of batteries kind of look like nickels and can be found at pretty much any nearby drugstore.\n\nWhile you can\u2019t check your AirTag\u2019s exact battery level at any time, you will see a low battery warning for your tracker in the Find My app once it\u2019s starting to get close to running out of juice. Once you\u2019re ready to make the swap, doing so is as simple as squeezing your AirTag, rotating the cover off, changing the battery and putting the cover back on. Here are some basic steps to follow, as outlined on Apple\u2019s website.\n\nWhile most CR2032 lithium batteries will do the job, there are a few trusted and extra-popular models worth keeping in mind for those looking to get the best value for the price. Duracell\u2019s lithium batteries are the ones that come with your AirTag, and based on a quick look at Amazon (as well as looking at what CNN Underscored readers are buying), they are just about the most frequently bought replacement out there.\n\nEnergizer\u2019s coin batteries are another well-loved option, and like Duracell\u2019s batteries, have a child-safe bitter coating to deter any little ones in your life from putting them in their mouths, as well as a Color Alert feature that will dye little mouths blue once the batteries comes in contact with saliva. If sheer bang for your buck is a priority, these frequently purchased LiCB batteries come in packs of 10, usually for just over five bucks.\n\nCNN Underscored has a team of writers and editors who have many years of experience testing, researching and recommending products, and they ensure each article is carefully edited and products are properly vetted. Senior tech editor Mike Andronico has been reviewing the latest tech products for more than a decade and currently has AirTags attached to everything from his musical instruments and Nintendo Switch case to his dog\u2019s harness.",

      "text": "It\u2019s a forlorn scene: after a long flight, you watch as each and every passenger departs the baggage area while you stand idle, waiting for your suitcase to appear on the belt. A walk to customer service takes place soon after.\nMany people have experienced landing at one destination, while their bags end up in another. About 6.9 bags per 1,000 passengers were mishandled in 2023, according to SITA, an IT provider for airlines. Of those mishandled bags, about 5% were reported as lost or stolen.\nNow, Apple wants to help you find your lost luggage.\nApple is unveiling a new feature where users will be able to share an Air Tag\u2019s location with third parties, like airlines. In the Find My application, users will be able to generate and share a link to an Air Tag\u2019s location as part of the \u201cShare Item Location\u201d feature.\nThe new service will be integrated into airline customer service at 15 carriers, including Delta and United, according to an Apple news release published on November 11. Passengers who attach an air tag to their luggage will be able to share its live location with the airline, helping people track their luggage while flying \u2014 and find it if lost.\nUsually, an Apple user can see the location of their Air Tags in their Find My application. Now, users will be able to create a live-updating link that they can share with others.\nThe link will lead to a website that will display the Air Tag\u2019s live location on an interactive Apple map. Users can disable the link at any time, and it will automatically expire either when the user is reunited with their Air Tag, or after seven days.\nDavid Kinzelman, United\u2019s chief customer officer, said the company will be incorporating the Share Item Location feature into its \u201cbaggage recovery process.\u201d\n\u201cWe know many of our customers are already traveling with AirTag in their checked bags, and this feature will soon make it easier for them to share location information with us safely and securely, helping our customer service agents work more efficiently and giving our customers added peace of mind,\u201d Kinzelman said in a statement. \u201cWe plan to accept Find My item locations in select airports initially, with the goal of introducing the service systemwide in early 2025.\u201d\nIn a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for United said more details would be shared over time.\nIn addition to integrating the Share Item Location feature directly into some airline companies\u2019 customer service, the technology will be built into SITA\u2019s baggage-tracing system that is used by more than 500 airlines and 2,800 airports across the globe.\nThe new Apple feature is available worldwide in beta and is part of the iOS 18.2 software update, which is expected to be released in December.\nSince being introduced in 2021, the Apple Air Tag product has helped people keep track of their belongings, from wallets to keys. Apple is betting it will help alleviate travelers\u2019 lost-luggage woes.\n\u201cThe Find My network and AirTag have proven to be a powerful combination for users while traveling, providing invaluable location information when bags have been misplaced or mishandled,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Services, said in a statement. \u201cWith Share Item Location, we\u2019re excited to give users a new way to easily share this information directly with third parties like airlines, all while protecting their privacy.\u201d\nThe airlines initially partnering with Apple to incorporate the feature into their customer service operations are Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eurowings, Iberia, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss International Airlines, Turkish Airlines, United, Virgin Atlantic and Vueling."
