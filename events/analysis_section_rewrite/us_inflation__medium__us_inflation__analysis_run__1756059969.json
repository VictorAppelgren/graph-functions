      "feedback": "The analysis has a solid policy-driven thesis (tariff backdrop, “Big Beautiful Bill,” GM capex and U.S. EV push) but it falls short of a world‑class 3–6 month map: the causal chain is underspecified, timing windows are vague, and the piece leans on broad claims rather than quantified, source‑backed impact ranges. To lift it, prune non‑critical politics chatter and tighten the auto/EV engine until it reads like a scenario playbook with explicit triggers, windows, and invalidations.\n\nActionable edits (structure and content)\n- Build a formal catalyst map: label 3–4 catalysts (tariff clarity/implementation, GM capex/Q3–Q4 guidance, Cadillac Elevated Velocity milestones, and the macro debt/deficit trajectory from the big bill) and assign each a near‑term window (0–1m, 1–3m, 3–6m). Tie each catalyst to a measurable inflection (e.g., tariff rate set at 25% on all imported autos/parts; GM guidance showing US output target >2m/year; Cadillac EV platform milestones; CBO/Deutsche Bank notes on demand). Cite precisely: tariffs (Source 2); GM capex/2m output target and plant layout (Source 4); Cadillac Velocity details (Source WTNT85IPR); debt/deficit impact of the bill (Source 4). \n- Quantify impacts with concrete ranges: price/margin pressures from tariffs (e.g., anticipated uplift in new‑vehicle prices of X%–Y% if tariffs pass; cite Deutsche Bank/Market notes where available); GM’s capex return runway (10–12B through 2027; 2m annual US output); recall/design costs that could press margins; and near‑term demand from Deutsche Bank note (April–May) about buyers rushing purchases. Where sources disagree (near‑term robustness vs. later weakness), present a split range and tie it to a trigger (tariffs confirmed vs. delayed). \n- Strengthen base case and alts with explicit numbers and paths: Base: tariff stability plus GM’s US ramp yields GM US production toward >2m by mid‑2026, with 3–6mo earnings on plan; Alt A: tariff acceleration or further escalation worsens pricing/recall exposure; Alt B: policy pullback or a delayed EV ramp reduces capex payoff. Ground these in sources: tariff policy (Source 2), GM capex and Orion/Factory ZERO/Tonawanda (Source 4), Cadillac Velocity positioning (Source WTNT85IPR), and the debt/deficit backdrop (Source 4). \n- Add invalidation rules and watch‑list signals: invalidations include a) tariffs not enacted or rolled back, b) GM guidance misses outputs or capex commitments, c) Cadillac timeline slips or a weaker EV uptake, d) debt/deficit trajectories worsen rates. Watch‑list: GM quarterly guidance, Orion/Factory ZERO progress, tariff announcements, consumer demand for EVs, and any material changes to the “big beautiful bill” debt path (cite sources accordingly). \n- Align all claims to critical sources and improve reconciliation: remove or minimize sources with tangential topics (e.g., broad politics chatter from RNC pieces unless tied to policy risk) and explicitly attach each factual assertion to a source ID (WTNT85IPR for Cadillac/GM EV push; D4 for GM capex; EPJYXB7DX for political backdrop where used; WTNT85IPR and Deutsche Bank note via Source 2 for near‑term demand; UPV3X2MQ6/ILY C1M41F for FIRE/alternative‑assets context if kept). Reconcile conflicts by presenting explicit ranges rather than single‑point bets and note where one source’s view is contingent on policy certainty.\n\nIn short, convert the current paragraph into a tight, date‑driven three‑to‑six‑month scenario with a clean base case and 1–2 clearly defined alts, anchor every assertion to a source ID, insert concrete timing windows and quantitative ranges, and articulate explicit triggers and invalidations. This will deliver the depth, traceability, and decision‑relevance that world‑class horizon work requires.",
