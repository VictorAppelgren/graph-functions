  "title": "Trump-Putin Summit Ends With No Details on Agreement",
  "description": "Bloomberg\u2019s Annmarie Hordern discusses President Trump\u2019s and Russian President Putin\u2019s meeting and talks about the press conference both leaders held that saw each one giving statements and not discussing any details on an agreement. Annmarie speaks with Joe Mathieu on the late edition of Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cBalance of Power.\u201d (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Well, a lot of people were caught off guard because, of course, this was supposed to be a press conference. But what we had in the end was just two leaders giving statements. President Putin's honestly was prepared remarks, and he did, though, signal that an agreement had taken place, that they agreed to something. President Trump immediately said there is no deal until there's a deal. Basically, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. And then he put a lot of weight on the phone conversations he's going to have subsequently leaving Anchorage. And that is going to be with European leaders, leaders of Naito and, of course, with President Volodymyr Zelensky. I think it is way too soon to jump to conclusions that we know really what the end game here was, because we just don't have enough details. Clearly, there was no a full agreement. There was there's no cessation of hostilities and we didn't even get past the three by three bilateral meeting with the foreign policy aides of both these leaders to expand into other discussions, which would have been a loss for Putin because, of course, he viewed this meeting in terms of restarting bilateral relationship with Washington to discuss New START, which of course expires in February of next year, to also discuss economic cooperation, rare earths in the Arctic. We're just south of the Arctic Circle, where we are now and and pressing for his economy are those sanctions. So we cannot jump to conclusions right now. But clearly, this is the start of a much longer process. In the meantime, President Putin, though, was given the red carpet as he landed in the United States for the first time in a decade.",

Neither side confirmed a cessation of hostilities or a comprehensive pact, and the meeting was limited to preliminary statements rather than substantive negotiations. Trump emphasized upcoming phone talks with European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelensky, while Putin viewed the event as a step toward renewing U.S.-Russia relations on issues like New START and Arctic economic cooperation. The meeting marked Putin\u2019s first U.S. visit in a decade and signals the beginning of a longer diplomatic process, though details remain scarce.",
