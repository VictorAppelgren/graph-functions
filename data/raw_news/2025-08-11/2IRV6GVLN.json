  "title": "Moo Moo Subaru: The viral car trend giving Jeep ducking a run for its money",
  "description": "Jeep fans are known for placing little rubber ducks on Jeeps they like. Now Subaru fans are using little cows to send their own message.",
  "content": "Jeep owners have some competition, at least when it comes to little rubber mascots: Move over Duck, Duck, Jeep. It\u2019s time for Moo Moo Subaru.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the message that a growing community of devoted Subaru lovers is spreading on notes they leave, along with little rubber cows, on Subarus all over the country.\n\nThe idea, like ducking for Jeep owners, where fans leave rubber ducks on Jeeps, is fairly straightforward: See a Subaru you like and let the owner know by leaving a little rubber cow and a note referencing the Facebook group, Moo Moo Subaru, on the hood or in a bag on the door handle or windshield wiper.\n\nIt\u2019s called getting \"mooed\" and, like its Jeep predecessor, it\u2019s become something of a mooovement, with Subaru owners sharing ideas and stories about their experiences on social media and highlighting more products, like decals and stuffed bovines, that can, as the Subaru campaign goes, help \u201cshare the love.\u201d\n\nThe Moo Moo Subaru Facebook group launched in June and has grown to more than 149,000 members as of Monday. A few other similarly dedicated Facebook groups have also popped up since Moo Moo Subaru launched. Most of the small rubber cows get ordered through Amazon, according to members of Moo Moo Subaru.\n\n\"You never know when someone's having a bad day and they come out and see a little plastic cow on their car and it just makes them forget about the bad day they've had and they just want to pass on the positivity and the kindness to the next person,\" said Staci Huckins, 48, of Troy, New Hampshire, one of Moo Moo Subaru's two Facebook group administrators.\n\nWhile U.S. car customers might be more familiar with the Jeep name, the Japanese Subaru has been steadily gaining ground on Stellantis' major SUV brand in the United States. Through the third quarter of this year, Jeep sales were at 490,106, a 9% drop compared with the same period in 2022, while Subaru managed sales of 467,223, a 16.5% increase over the same period a year prior, according to U.S. sales figures from both, covering all models.\n\nHow moo moo came to be be\n\nThe Facebook group and the resulting moo moo movement began with a conversation between Huckins and a friend, according to both women. They live in different parts of New Hampshire and work for the same propane company as customer service representatives.\n\nHuckins was asking her friend, Crystal Hamann, 39, of Rochester, New Hampshire, about ducking. Huckins drives a Subaru Crosstrek and Hamann drives a Jeep Wrangler, the most popular Jeep model to duck. Hamann\u2019s very involved in ducking Jeeps that she likes.\n\n\u201cI jokingly told her that I didn't think it was fair and that I was going to start ducking Subarus because Subarus are clearly better than Jeeps, and we deserve something, too. And she told me that wasn't allowed. So being the sarcastic person I am, I said, \u2018All right, I'll find something else,\u2019 and ended up coming up with cows,\u201d Huckins told the Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, noting that moo happens to rhyme with Subaru.\n\nHuckins also learned something else as she considered what to use instead of ducks, that the Subaru logo, with stars on a blue background, actually represents a part of the Taurus constellation, according to Subaru. Seeing the connection to the astrological bull, she chose the cow.\n\nI moo, you moo, we all moo for Subaru\n\nIn no time, the Facebook group exploded in popularity.\n\n\u201cThe cows have just taken off. People love just throwing them out there and just spreading the love essentially. Staci calls it a mooovement,\u201d Hamann said. \u201cOur goal was just to create something that would just make somebody smile and share the happiness. \u2026 So far it seems to be working and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve accomplished and we just kind of want it to keep going.\u201d\n\nHamann is pleased with the results, but she has no intention of giving up her Jeep, which she uses for off-roading, in favor of a Subaru. She said her daughter would disown her if she drives anything else.\n\nHuckins, however, is all about her 2015 Crosstrek, a charcoal gray number she calls Bella.\n\n\u201cI love everything about it. It\u2019s the perfect size. It gets me everywhere I need to go. It\u2019s comfortable, easy to drive and pretty,\u201d Huckins said, noting that Bella is her sixth Subaru. \u201cThey\u2019re reliable. They\u2019re safe, and they can be driven pretty much forever.\u201d\n\nDominick Infante, a spokesman for Subaru of America, said the company is aware of the Facebook group but isn't an active participant from the brand level.\n\n\"We do think it is great. It is a great example of the passion of our owners. Moo Moo Subaru is an organic, owner-driven initiative that helps to enhance the already strong sense of community that exists among Subaru enthusiasts,\" Infante said in an email to the Free Press.\n\nShelly Baldwin, who lives in the Coldwater area, a couple of hours drive southwest of Detroit, was one of dozens of people who replied to a message from a Free Press reporter in the Facebook group asking if there were members from Michigan.\n\nBaldwin also loves her Subaru, a 2019 Outback she calls her Hot Wheels car because of the flame decals that have been added to the side. She admitted it\u2019s a little more flamboyant than what she expected before they were added. This marks her fourth Subaru, all of which have been Outbacks. The Outback, she said, is the perfect-sized vehicle to haul her golf clubs.\n\nBaldwin joined the Facebook group about a month ago and just recently started mooing people, placing a couple of the little cows on Subarus in Battle Creek and one at a private club where she\u2019s a member. Subaru and Jeep owners follow a similar playbook in terms of leaving the little rubber animals on vehicle hoods or door handles.\n\nIt was exciting, but Baldwin said it made her a bit nervous, too, putting something on someone\u2019s car when that person isn\u2019t expecting it. She\u2019s not done, however. She bought about two dozen cows, including some miniatures, through Amazon, for about $15 or $20.\n\n\u201cI thought it was so much fun,\u201d she said, noting that she hopes it gives someone a chuckle and maybe \u201ca bright spot in their day.\u201d\n\nPamela Pitlanish, 68, is a recent convert to the Subaru tribe and moved a few weeks ago to be near her grandkids. She downsized in June from a diesel Ford F-350 truck.\n\n\"It was humongous,\" she said, noting that she had to sit on a pillow for visibility but now she has a 2021 Crosstrek, which is \"a little car I can fit in that I can see over the dash.\"\n\nPlus, the Crosstrek seems tailor-made to accommodate Pitlanish's \"cow dog,\" Deebo, which she adopted from Saginaw. Deebo weighs 115 pounds and is a mix of American pit bull, St. Bernard, Great Dane and mastiff, Pitlanish said.\n\nPitlanish didn't know about the Facebook group when she got her car, but now she's a member and she's given out a couple of cows, leaving them hooked on door handles or a wiper. There's some controversy in the group, she said, from folks concerned about touching someone else's vehicle, but Pitlanish reasoned that this is Michigan, where road salt is \"eating up\" people's cars.\n\nAlthough her time in the Subaru camp only dates back to June, Pitlanish says her fascination with cows is decades old. During the test drive in the Crosstrek, she said a friend asked what she planned to name the car, and she replied, \"SubaMoo.\" These days, the Crosstrek even sports a big cow decal on the back window, she said, adding:",

      "text": "Jeep owners spill secrets of hand signals, finding an \u2018extended family\u2019\nIs it OK for a Jeep Wrangler driver to wave to someone behind the wheel of a Grand Cherokee?\nThe question itself is not to be taken lightly, and it can get even more complicated. Is the Grand Cherokee modified? Some peoplewould wave at a modified Grand Cherokee but refuse to wave at a stock Jeep even if it is a Wrangler, the vehicle even non-Jeep fans immediately recognize as a Jeep.\nThe wave might be as simple as popping a couple of fingers up off the top of the steering wheel. Or it might be four fingersor a full hand\u2019s worth (safely, of course). Descriptions vary. After all, we\u2019re not just talking about any wave, we\u2019re talking about the Jeep Wave, that signifier and sign of respect among Jeep owners that they\u2019re part of the same club \u2014 that they get it.\nMany a video exists online to explore The Wave and its etiquette. In December, the host of the Cheap Jeeper YouTube channel out of Australia decided that it doesn\u2019t make sense to discriminate, so wave away:\n\u201cYou\u2019re part of a massive family no matter if you guys are from America, South America, New Zealand, Australia, England, France, wherever ... it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re all part of a community and you just don\u2019t get that with any other brand of car.\u201d\nThis is the essence of what\u2019s called the Jeep Life, which is a community, a club, an attitude and an outlook all rolled into one. It\u2019s taking the doors and top off and riding with the wind blowing your hair back. It\u2019s crawling over rocks in your 4x4. It\u2019s fitting your Wrangler with a snorkel or tube doors or skid plates. It's hauling your Jeep on a trailer so you still have a way home if you \"break it\" on the trail. It\u2019s in-jokes and memes shared on countless Facebook pages along with videos of mud-covered Jeeps going back for more. It\u2019s Jeep-inspired jewelry, coffee mugs and furniture. And it\u2019s a marketer\u2019s dream.\nPlenty of long-standing car nameplates have devoted followings, with their own clubs and meetups (Mustangs and Camaros come to mind), but good luck finding anything among mainstream brands approaching the connections Jeep has with its followers, who happily point to a history tied to the rugged vehicles that helped America and her allies fight and win the Second World War. A brand controlled by a multinational corporation with siblings named Fiat, Maserati and soon probably Peugeot snags the top spot on the Brand Keys annual consumer survey of most patriotic American brands. It probably doesn\u2019t hurt that the Wrangler and now the Gladiator pickup hail from Toledo, Ohio, the spiritual home of Jeep.\nThis shows the hill Ford, a company itself with ties to the early manufacture of military jeeps, is trying to climb with its new Bronco, a name with off-roading and pop culture traditions of its own. An SUV that represents the first real challenge Jeep has faced in its off-roading space in a long time easily prompts dismissive comments from loyal Jeep fans.\n\u201cThat it\u2019s a wanna-be Jeep. Everybody loves the Jeep so much they\u2019ve shown they\u2019ve just gotta copy it, which I understand, but it won\u2019t ever be a Jeep,\u201d said Mike Hardin, who lives on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island.\nHave you heard of ducking? Jeep owners purchase rubber duckies so they can leave them on a Jeep they spot on the street or a parking lot or wherever, maybe with a sticker or card attached. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cNice Jeep.\u201d Anniece Jamison, founder of Detroit Black JeepHers, a women's only club, said she bought a bag of 50 recently and had given out 30 ducks by the time she had talked to a Free Press reporter.\nJeep owners also love to name their Jeeps. Sometimes the name is stripped across the top of the windshield. Sometimes it\u2019s right on the edge of the hood. \u201cOh my goodness, that is probably the No. 1 or No. 2 topic\u201d on the many Jeep fan pages, said John Kistner, of the questions about what to name a Jeep. Kistner named his Wrangler Bah Bah Black Jeep, a moniker it shares with his Facebook group of more than 100,000 followers.\nSo who are these Jeep people?\nDetroit Jeep City\nEver since Anniece Jamison was a little girl, waking up on Christmas morning and seeing a pink Barbie Jeep, she has wanted a Wrangler.\nShe said she\u2019s far from alone.\n\u201cI think every girl that starts off with a Barbie Jeep, right on down the line, they end up with a Wrangler,\u201d said Jamison, 24.\nJamison\u2019s ride, however, isn\u2019t pink. It\u2019s orange, and that's how she found her name.\n\u201cOrange Crush, like the drink, like the pop. At first, I was thinking pumpkin,\u201d Jamison said.\nBut one day Jamison stopped at a gas station and picked up an Orange Crush.\n\u201cIt was sitting in my cup holder, and it was like, this is the exact same color.\u201d\nShe has had the 2014 Wrangler for about two years, something she got after going to work at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u2019 Sterling Heights Assembly Plant, where Jeep\u2019s parent company makes the Ram 1500 pickup. Jamison, whose 8-month-old Chihuahua, Snowy, loves to ride with her, grew up in Detroit and moved to Shelby Township to be closer to her job, bringing materials to the assembly line. Her fianc\u00e9 works at the same plant. They planned to get married this year, but COVID-19 intervened and now they will tie the knot next August.\nAlthough she moved to Macomb County, Jamison still represents the Motor City as founder of Detroit Black JeepHers, one of the scores of clubs that cater to Jeep owners, except this one is for African American women with Wranglers. She started the club in April as COVID-19 was changing how we connect socially.\n\u201cOut here in Shelby, Sterling Heights, Rochester, there\u2019s a lot of Jeeps, a lot of Jeeps everywhere you go. Up and down the street, you\u2019ll see at least five, six different Jeeps,\u201d Jamison said, describing how she started looking for an all-women's Jeep group, finding some around the state and even in the metro area but not necessarily connected to Detroit. \u201cI talked to my fianc\u00e9. I said, 'We\u2019re the Motor City; we need a Jeep group in Detroit.' He was like, \u2018You should start one.\u2019 \u201d\nSince then, the group has only grown in size and vision. It now claims 80 members, with interest from all over the region, stretching as far as Toronto. There have been some events, like a meetup at Belle Isle, a back-to-school rally in Highland Park, a trip to the Ford-Wyoming Drive-in in Dearborn and a celebration of one member's birthday, driving past her house in a horn-blowing \"Jeepcade\" of 30 or 40 vehicles.\n\u201cWhen I first started the group, I was like, OK, you know, this is something that us women, that we can do together. It really brought a lot of women together. Now it\u2019s pretty much like a sisterhood,\u201d she explained, noting that the ages of those in her club range from 22 to about 52. \u201cIf you have a Jeep, a Jeep comes with friends. I read that a long time ago before I got my Jeep and I was like, OK, having a Jeep comes with friends. But it actually does.\u201d\nA baby named Stevie\nMelissa Dinkins picked up her baby 13 years ago.\nShe\u2019d just graduated from nursing school. Dinkins, who turns 44 in December, saw the 2002 black Jeep Wrangler at a dealership and took it home the same day.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the baby of my five,\u201d said Dinkins of the five Jeeps in her fleet. She also has a 1994 Wrangler she bought in Detroit and restored, two 1946 CJ-2As and her \u201cdaily driver,\u201d a Jeep Renegade. In Jeep world, there are lots of initials designating different models over the years.\nThis Jeep fixation is a kind of addiction, but Dinkins, a hospice nurse living in Laingsburg, near Lansing, loves it.\n\u201cThe freedom. There\u2019s no other vehicle that you can take the top and the doors off and just drive. It\u2019s an amazing thing,\u201d Dinkins said, describing the joys of off-roading on Drummond Island or driving her Jeep, all decorated with holiday lights and tinsel, in the DeWitt Christmas parade.\nIn photos, the name \u201cStevie,\u201d after \u201cthe great Stevie Nicks,\u201d shines in red lettering against the black exterior paint.\nBut it\u2019s not just the ride. Dinkins loves her Jeep family, too. Her women-only club, Michigan Jeep Ladies, has about 1,500 members on Facebook. It\u2019s one of the many clubs across the country that caters to the unique community that has grown up around Jeeps, many of them dedicated to hard-core off-roading but others to those who just like Jeeps and the opportunity to get together.\n\u201cThe Jeep community is essentially a secondary family,\u201d she said, pointing to her experience as a front-line worker in the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cThe Jeep community reached out to me more than I would have imagined. My people in my club were bringing supplies to me and bringing food and PPEs. They\u2019re an extended family,\u201d Dinkins said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got different views on everything in life, but (Jeeps are) one common ground, so when we all get together, everybody \u2026 absolutely gets along.\u201d\nBright purple with racing stripes\nPatrick Foster remembers the moment when the idea now encompassed in the Jeep Life ethos became evident to him.\nIt was 1970 and Foster, who was a mechanic, later a Jeep salesman and now an author of numerous books on Jeep, was walking around the campus of Yale in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\u201cOut of this side road comes a brand new CJ5 and the fricking thing is purple, bright purple, and it\u2019s got racing stripes on the hood, and it\u2019s got these big wheels on it and it says \u2018Jeep Renegade\u2019 on the side,\u201d Foster said.\nHe asked his buddy what he was seeing. It was a then-new sport model.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Man, I like that a lot.\u2019 \u201d\nMore: Idea for trippy new Jeep ad was in secret computer folder for years \u2014 until now\nMore: Jeep aims to ambush Ford Bronco with silent Wrangler 4xe electric off-roading\nMore: Jeep ran a contest for dogs \u2014 and it just picked a winner\nFoster\u2019s spent more time than most contemplating the meaning of Jeep and its attraction as an American brand \u2014 though the current version of the Renegade, for instance, is made in Italy. The Jeep Compass is another model with an international vibe, with production in Brazil, India, China and Mexico.\n\u201cIt appeals because, particularly in the case of the Wrangler, it represents freedom, and it represents what people perceive as a very American brand. Rightly or wrongly, they see it as a very American product,\u201d said Foster, who is still based in Connecticut.\nOf course, a vehicle known for its off-roading chops can\u2019t just look the part.\n\u201cJeep has just got that image of being much more capable when it comes to designing and building four-wheel drive vehicles, and I subscribe to that. I think Jeep four-wheel drive vehicles are, for the most part, superior to others,\u201d said Foster, who might have tipped his hand by titling his 2014 book, \u201cJeep: The History of the World\u2019s Greatest Vehicle.\u201d\nJeeping in paradise\nMike Hardin had always been into off-roading but not necessarily with a Jeep.\nBefore he moved to Hawaii from Georgia about a decade ago, he figured he'd better get one.\n\u201cBecause we knew Hawaii has all (these) nice trails down to the ocean, and I wanted to make sure we\u2019d be able to get to all these hidden gems,\u201d he explained.\nHardin, 39, is president of the Big Island Jeep Club, which has about 56 active members. They're all great people, he said.\n\u201cJust fun to hang out with. No drama. No, he said, she said, high school stuff. Just get out and have a good time.\u201d\nHardin and his wife, Jenn Corso, have four Wranglers now. His main ride is a blue 2005 TJ with a four-inch lift and some other add-ons. He calls his Jeep Bruiser, although that\u2019s an unofficial name. His wife\u2019s Wrangler is yellow when it\u2019s not covered in mud, and fittingly named Queen Bee. They\u2019re beekeepers, after all.\nHardin, expressing a conviction held by many in the wider Jeep world, has strong views on his vehicle of choice:\n\u201cJeep is by far the best off-roading vehicle that you could have. It\u2019s not a Toyota ... it\u2019s just the pure ability of what Jeeps can do. I\u2019ve never been stuck in my Jeep,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cWe go through some tight turns. These things will turn on a dime. You can do a U-turn in the middle of the street if you needed to.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s the freedom of open air.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice, especially here, to have the top down, enjoy the wind and the sun on your face and go hit up a beach or just cruise with all the other local Jeepers,\u201d said Hardin, who lives in Ocean View.\nLike so many other Jeepers, dogs figure into the picture. Unfortunately, Hardin lost his furry companion, a Siberian husky named Jake, a couple of weeks ago, after 13\u00bd years of being together.\nEarly on, Jake was always along for the ride.\n\u201cHe\u2019d go down to the beach with us. He loved trying to find some sea cucumber in the little bay or whatever. Once he started getting older, it got harder for him to ride,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cWe got him cremated, so he will be riding with us again.\u201d\nThat connection, dogs and Jeeps, tends to be a big part of the Jeep Life ethos. Several of the Jeep fans who spoke to the Free Press mentioned or knew of the recent contest FCA hosted to pick a Jeep Top Canine from thousands of entries. The winner was named Bear, a mostly black Lab, with Collie, Chow-Chow, a little standard poodle and some other blend, according to his family in Northborough, Massachusetts. Bear, who becomes the face of the Jeep brand for its social media channels, will hold the title until National Dog Day 2021.\nJeepers in mourning and solidarity\nFor Catherine Fanaro, an event last May made a deep impression.\nIt\u2019s hard for her to put it into words.\nHundreds of Jeeps, maybe 700 or more. Miles and miles of vehicles, she said.\nFanaro, a 32-year-old mother of two and hotel supervisor, had helped organize a Jeep procession for the funeral of Kendrick Castillo, an 18-year-old who was killed as he \u201crushed the shooter\u201d in an attack at his school in a suburb of Denver. His selfless actions saved lives, and Fanaro\u2019s group, Colorado Jeep Girls, and others in the state\u2019s off-roading community wanted to be there for him.\n\u201cWhen Kendrick died it was all over the news obviously, and we noticed here in Colorado that Kendrick had a Jeep Cherokee. In the past we have done other (convoys) for fallen police officers. We have also done one for a female Jeeper in Colorado to kind of show support that we\u2019re the Jeep family that they had and so we figured we\u2019d do something like that for Kendrick, and it actually blew up way bigger than anticipated,\u201d said Fanaro, who grew up with Jeeps in her family and off-roading her whole life.\nShe\u2019s trying to give the same sense of place to her daughters, 6 and 12.\nMore: Fiat Chrysler, led by Ram, leapfrogs Ford in customer satisfaction; GM drops in survey\nMore: Jeep Grand Wagoneer concept shows FCA is ready to play with big SUVs\nMore: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles says it has fix for Jeep 'Death Wobble'\n\u201cI have two daughters and I am raising them in the scene, and I think that they gain a lot of trust and knowledge and all sorts of things from \u2026 different walks of life and all different kinds of people, and I think that is a very unique thing about Jeep,\u201d she said, calling it a different level of family from what she\u2019s experienced with other car scenes.\n\u201cJust in my club alone, I have people that I know have my back. They support me. I can reach out to the whole Colorado community if anything happens or I need help with my Jeep. People will stop what they\u2019re doing and come help each other,\u201d she said, noting that she volunteers with an off-road rescue and recovery nonprofit.\nFanaro\u2019s 2001 Jeep Cherokee is \u201cmodded,\u201d with a 7-inch lift and 8.8-inch axle in the rear. She laughed, and said, \u201ctoo much,\u201d when asked how much she\u2019d spent on it, maybe $10,000 all together, including the $4,000 she paid for it four years ago.\nBetty White is what Fanaro calls hers because the Jeep's got that spirit. \u201cShe\u2019s an old lady, but she keeps on going,\u201d Fanaro said, in a nod to the stamina that's a mark of the legendary 98-year-old comedian, actress and TV pioneer Betty White.\nThe Cherokee is \u201ckind of like the ugly stepchild of Jeep, but I love them.\u201d\n\u201cI have more pride in my Jeep than I\u2019ve ever had in any vehicle. I know a lot of people, their blood sweat and tears go into their Jeep. It\u2019s like a gateway to learning so much about yourself as a person and your abilities,\u201d said Fanaro, who lives in Evergreen, about 45 minutes from Denver.\nShe started Colorado Jeep Girls in 2012. It\u2019s an all-women club, although it does have a partner membership open to all for half the $100 full price.\n\u201cI think for women it\u2019s kind of a hard thing to go into a mostly male-dominated hobby and try to find ... a no-pressure place to learn and grow, so I started the club just to meet other women first off who were interested in Jeeps, but second off, to teach what I know and learn things from and it\u2019s really grown since then.\u201d\nDeep in the heart of Jeep country\nFor John Kistner, the best part of the Jeep Life is bringing hundreds of Jeepers together, to watch a movie at a drive-in theater, to cruise the track at the Texas Motor Speedway or to park scores of Jeeps to form the shape of Texas in a field during the Plano Balloon Festival.\nFor five years, until COVID-19 intervened this year, the trip to the Speedway meant Jeeps riding two or three wide, rolling at 60 mph, people having a good time, shooting videos. It\u2019s something that\u2019s not just about off-roading, but also about doing fun things in town, too.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have the lift. You can just come out with your family, enjoy the time with other Jeepers, maybe form some new friendships or find a club that you wanted to hang out with more, but it was mostly about me trying to give back to the community, a way to share my enthusiasm,\u201d said Kistner, 52, who lives in Longview, Texas, and runs the popular Bah Bah Black Jeep Facebook page, and has organized various get-togethers over the years. \u201cTo me it\u2019s the community, it\u2019s the getting together, being together, getting to know each other.\u201d\nEveryone involved shares a general interest in Jeeps and then that grows when those involved have the same model, whether it\u2019s two Gladiator people or two Liberty people, he said.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where the community spirit really shines, especially if we\u2019ve got some sort of a tragic type of event like a hurricane or flood, when you see these Jeep clubs or communities coming together for a common cause to collect water or food or blankets or socks or whatever,\u201d Kistner said.\nOf course, there\u2019s a little showing off, too, along with the do-gooding.\n\u201cWe like to take all our doors and tops off and put some flags on and drive 10 miles around the city to the drop-off zone just so we can make a big deal out of getting together. Maybe disrupting a little bit of traffic. If we\u2019re lucky we can get some police vehicles to let us through the red lights so we could stay together and make it to our destination,\u201d Kistner said.\nJeeps have been in Kistner's family since 1998.\nHis wife, Donna, said she always wanted a Jeep and so he said he\u2019d get her one for her 30th birthday. That first one was a chili pepper red Wrangler, and Donna drove it every day for 10 years. When their son, Taylor, turned 16, Kistner said they started tinkering with it, adding lift kits and different wheels.\nThe first one, of course, was not the last.\nKistner\u2019s family has had maybe eight Jeeps over the years (he\u2019s lost exact count). His son and daughter are grown and out of the house, but he said they\u2019ll never lose their love of off-roading. Taylor is now into side-by-sides, a type of utility vehicle, but Kistner\u2019s daughter, Tyler, is on her third Jeep, a Grand Cherokee. His dog is a black Lab, also a rescue, named CJ, another nod to his vehicle of choice.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty obsessed if you will, in a mild sense,\u201d he said.\nContact Eric D.
