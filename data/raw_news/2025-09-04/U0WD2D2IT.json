  "content": "Take a glance at bond prices in China and India and you will see a strikingly different picture to what is happening in Britain and France.\n\nGovernments in Beijing and New Delhi have seen borrowing costs fall in recent years. By contrast, Western economies have endured rising bond yields as the costs of servicing national debts have hit levels not seen since the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\n\nOn Monday, images of a laughing Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin were beamed across the world from northern China\u2019s Tianjin region.\n\nThe trio \u2013 part of the Brics group of emerging economies \u2013 put on a show of camaraderie as they sought to cement an alliance of \u201cstrongmen\u201d leaders who have run their countries since 2013, 2014 and 2000 respectively.\n\nA look at the debt costs of these nations shows why they have some reason to be cheerful. China\u2019s 30-year bond yield has fallen from around 3.4pc in 2022 to 2.06pc this week, less than half of the premium demanded by investors in British debt.\n\nIn India, equivalent yields are down from a peak of 7.88pc in 2022 to 7.26pc.\n\nRussia maintains its international pariah status, cutting it off from the mainstream bond market. However, it has found other ways to keep money rolling in. Moscow on Tuesday announced it had agreed to supply more natural gas to China.\n\n\u201cEveryone is incrementally shifting their view on how the world is working,\u201d says James Athey, a bond trader at investment manager Marlborough. \u201cIt is happening gradually and slowly in the background.\u201d\n\nGordon Shannon, a portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management, says the relative borrowing cost benefits being enjoyed by the likes of China are as much about Western turmoil as they are about policy in Beijing.\n\n\u201cI would argue the market\u2019s preference isn\u2019t so much for strongmen as for politicians who have the willingness and ability to cut spending,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cOver the last couple of years, the market\u2019s willingness to overlook the unsustainable fiscal positions of developed market economies has seemingly waned significantly.\u201d\n\nFrance is on the brink of its second government collapse in less than a year after failing to pass reforms designed to cut spiralling public spending. The 30-year yield on French government debt climbed to its highest level since 2009 this week.\n\nIn Britain \u2013 even with a working majority of 156 \u2013 Sir Keir Starmer has been unable to get spending cuts past his own MPs, sending long-term UK borrowing costs surging to their highest level since 1998.\n\n\u201cInflation, ballooning government debt piles to finance Covid-19 measures and a lack of political willingness to rein in spending has resulted in investors shopping globally for alternatives,\u201d says Shannon.",

  "summary": "The bond prices in China and India are significantly different from those seen in Britain and France. These countries have seen borrowing costs fall in recent years, while Western economies have seen rising bond yields due to rising costs of servicing national debts. China's 30-year bond yield has dropped from around 3.4pc in 2022 to 2.06pc, less than half of the premium demanded by investors in British debt. Meanwhile, India's equivalent yields have dropped from a peak of 7.88pc in 2021 to 7.26pc. The relative borrowing cost benefits are due to Western turmoil as much as policy in Beijing.",
