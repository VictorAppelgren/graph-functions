  "description": "Cars' driver assist tech is nice to have, but you can't fully depend on it to work perfectly all the time.",
  "content": "Advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) are supposed to make your driving easier and safer, and they do that. Features like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking are wonderful to have when they work well. But, when they don't, ADAS can range from annoying to terrifying.\n\nMost cars made in this decade will have some level of ADAS built into them, and who wouldn't want the car to brake hard when a pedestrian wanders onto the road? Or warn you when you are about to reverse into another car?\n\nYet many drivers are turning off their ADAS, or trying to turn them off. New technology often doesn't work perfectly to start with, but what would be an annoyance in a new phone can be deadly in a car going at 50 mph. There is no doubt that ADAS can make driving a lot safer, but it feels as if carmakers are sometimes rushing this technology. Here are five of the worst cases where ADAS turns from a feature into a bug.\n\nLane keeping assist uses a camera to track the markings between lanes and on the edge of the road. If you stray too close to the edge or cross the line without indicating, it will first alert you, and then gently correct your steering.\n\nDirt, sand, rain, snow, or leaves can obscure the lane markings, and even a shadow across the road can confuse the system. Worn, badly painted, or complicated road markings can also cause the system to malfunction, while hardware or software problems are fairly common as well.\n\nThe system will send false alerts, and can cause the car to drive erratically and weave within the lane. It can also suddenly stop working, which can be dangerous if the driver assumes it is still functional.\n\nWill mitigate collision, can cause same\n\nAutonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) automatically applies the brakes when its sensors -- cameras, radar, lidar -- detect a probable collision and the driver does not react. It is a great idea, because the slower the vehicle is going, the less severe the impact.\n\nBesides system malfunctions or dirt on the sensors, phantom braking can be caused by many factors, including:\n\u2022 Shadows and the edges of overpasses are sometimes misread as objects\n\u2022 Bright sunlight on the windshield can confuse camera sensors and cause sudden braking\n\u2022 Objects like streetlights, manhole covers, or debris on the road\n\u2022 Vehicles in adjacent lanes or those merging can be misidentified\n\nIf a car suddenly slams on its brakes on a busy road, the chances of an accident become very likely. The car braking may be rear-ended by the car behind, while cars trying to avoid an accident may be involved in sideswipes or even head-on collisions.\n\nThere's a small arch behind and to the side of your car where you cannot see another vehicle in either your rearview mirror or wing mirror. A blind spot monitor is a sensor, normally embedded in the rear fender, that will pick up this invisible car and alert you with a warning light in your wing mirror.\n\nIt's a brilliant idea, and when it works properly, a great way to make your driving safer. Blind spot monitoring works so well that I no longer bother to crane my neck to check when merging in an awkward curve. And the danger is when you fully trust technology and it suddenly stops working.\n\u2022 Faulty warning signal, ranging from no warning to signaling on the wrong side of the car\n\nDriving into the space of the vehicle behind you can result in anything from screeching brakes and angry hooting to a serious sideswipe that can cause your car to roll. A faulty signal on the wrong side can cause you to veer the wrong way. A blind-spot monitor is such a brilliant piece of tech that we completely rely on it, which means we are never prepared for when it stops working.\n\nAdaptive cruise control is like normal cruise control, but it can sense the traffic in front of the car and adjust the speed to keep a safe following distance. It's a joy to have in rush-hour traffic, but because it takes such an active part in the way the car drives, a malfunction can have serious consequences.\n\u2022 Poor visibility because of rain, snow, fog, or wind-blown dust and leaves can confuse the sensors\n\u2022 Curves in the road, steep hills, or uneven road surfaces\n\u2022 A stopped vehicle or one that brakes rapidly in front of your car\n\nThe system can start giving false alerts in rural or desert conditions, or on complicated roadways. It can also stay so far behind the car in front that other drivers will continuously push in front of you. The system can also cause the vehicle to slow down suddenly in a dangerous situation, or fail to slow down because it did not recognize an obstacle.\n\nThis is the biggest issue with ADAS in general: when one of the features suddenly stops working without the driver realizing. Because they generally work so well, drivers, myself included, feel able to relax and not pay as much attention to the road as we should.\n\u2022 All electronics can stop working at any stage, but most do not do so at 60 mph\n\u2022 Hardware can stop working because of damage, wear and tear, dirt on the sensors, or even adverse weather conditions\n\u2022 Software can misread signals, suffer data overload, or just stop working\n\nWhen an ADAS suddenly stops working without the driver realizing it, the results can be anything from backing into the car behind you to causing a severe accident. Until we reach the stage where true autonomous driving is possible, we should treat ADAS for what it is: driver assistance, and not self-driving.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Tesla is now updating Cybertrucks with Full Self-Driving, but only for drivers in its early access program.\n- The option costs $99 per month or $8,000 upfront.\n- Wide access may have to wait for October or later.\nTesla is finally delivering a promised version of its Full Self-Driving feature for Cybertruck owners, Electrek reports. The automaker has squeaked through a September launch window, delivering 12.5.5 v12 software to drivers in its early access program. Based on Tesla's track record, it's likely that other Cybertruck owners won't have access to FSD until late October -- if not November or later. The company could hypothetically postpone a wide rollout if unexpected glitches surface.\nWhile every new Tesla has Autopilot driver assistance, Full Self-Driving is an extension that's hypothetically capable of taking a vehicle on a complete trip, including highways and freeways. Tesla notes that the V12 software merges city and highway driving into a single stack, while also adding attention monitoring with sunglasses support -- your truck won't think you've fallen asleep or started texting because you're wearing shades on a sunny day, in other words.\nThe tech doesn't come cheap -- adding it to a Cybertruck involves a $99 monthly subscription, or else an $8,000 one-time fee. That's despite the vehicle shipping with the necessary cameras and other hardware since its November 2023 debut.\nTesla's race to make self-driving reliable\nThe reason attention monitoring is a key part of Tesla's software is that Full Self-Driving sometimes fails to live up to its name, requiring a driver to grab the wheel to prevent an accident or execute a turn properly. CEO Elon Musk has been promising unsupervised FSD since 2016 -- most recently claiming that it could happen by the end of 2025, as InsideEVs notes. That would be a first in the consumer auto industry, likely cementing Tesla's dominance in the North American EV market.\nAdding to the pressure is a robotaxi unveiling scheduled for October 10. Any product Tesla shows off will be fully dependent on FSD, so it needs to improve the technology's reliability as fast as possible if it wants to launch within a reasonable timeframe. It's already facing competition in the form of taxi firms like Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors' Cruise.\nSafety remains an overwhelming concern with self-driving systems. While there have been relatively few accidents, robotaxis can sometimes create traffic snarls by being overly conservative, slowing or stopping for threats that a human driver would know how to handle. People against self-driving cars have sometimes exploited this to protest."

      "text": "Summary\n- Adaptive Power Mode lets iOS 26 automatically throttle some functions when your iPhone is consuming a lot of battery life.\n- If you've got iOS 26 installed already, you can find the option using Settings > Battery > Power Mode.\n- The mode may exist to deflect criticisms about battery life in Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air, said to be extremely thin like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.\nYou'd be forgiven for missing out on any new battery features in iOS 26, which is currently in beta ahead of a fall release date, alongside new iPhones. Battery tech typically isn't that sexy, and of course there are more conspicuous changes to iOS, namely the Liquid Glass makeover. Some people are probably going to spend the first hour after installing the update just getting used to where buttons and menus are located.\nBattery tech is something that can noticeably improve the experience of using a smartphone, however -- whereas visual overhauls are usually little more than cosmetic. The big new battery-related feature in iOS 26 is called Adaptive Power Mode, and it's worth learning about whether you've got the iOS 26 beta or you're waiting for the final software to drop in September.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 Pro (3nm)\n- Display\n- 6.3-inch 1,206 x 2,622 pixel resolution 120Hz LTPO Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, HDR10, Dolby Vision, 1000 nits (typical), 2000 nits (peak)\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\nDon't believe the hype - this Android phone won't support Apple products for long\nApple sometimes plays nice with Android, but only on its own terms.\nWhat is Adaptive Power Mode?\nLess Draconian throttling\nIf you've been following the tech industry for a while, you're probably aware of a controversy that emerged several years ago, when it was discovered Apple updated iOS to intentionally throttle the performance of older iPhones -- without telling anybody until after fact. Nominally, this was intended to address battery degradation, but the parties who successfully sued Apple didn't see it that way. They saw it as planned obsolescence, a way of forcing customers to upgrade sooner. Battery life doesn't matter much if your phone can't keep up with the latest apps.\nYou can think of Adaptive Power Mode as a benign version of that concept. It's off by default, and it's really just meant to extend your day-to-day longevity so you're less likely to be scrambling for a charger before bedtime. The feature detects when battery usage is higher than normal and makes \"small performance adjustments\" to keep battery drain under control.\nIt's really just meant to extend your day-to-day longevity, so you're less likely to be scrambling for a charger before bedtime.\nWhat sort of adjustments are those? Apple is a little vague in the current iOS 26 betas, but the company does suggest examples like \"slightly lowering the display brightness,\" or \"allowing some activities to take a little longer.\" Presumably, the second example includes things like background email and photo sync -- if you're playing Resident Evil 4 on your iPhone, you're probably not too concerned if those vacation photos aren't uploading to iCloud right away.\nSuch tactics would also be consistent with what iOS does in Low Power Mode. The difference is that in Adaptive Power Mode, there's no blanket reduction of brightness and activity, and Apple doesn't seem to prompt you to turn it on, even when your iPhone is at 20% power or less. You may not notice it working at all in many circumstances. It seems to be an option intended for power users -- no pun intended -- or something that Apple Support staff can point to for people complaining about how long their iPhone lasts. More on that one in a minute.\nYou can, incidentally, have both Adaptive Power and Low Power active at the same time. The second remains a measure of last resort, something you should flip on temporarily when it feels like a charge is miles away. Adaptive Power can be left on indefinitely, hopefully with little consequence.\nI finally found a tech routine to help me get a good night\u2019s sleep\nThere's no digital cure-all for bad sleep, but tech can help instead of being a hindrance.\nHow to turn on Adaptive Power Mode\nA few quick steps\nIf you've already got iOS 26, there's not much to it -- it's just that Apple's rearranged its Settings app a little. Note that ahead of fall 2025, you need to be an Apple developer, or (starting in July) enroll your iPhone in the Apple Beta Software Program. Either is potentially risky. By their nature, betas are more unstable than finished releases, and a critical glitch could render features or your entire device unusable. It is possible to downgrade back to iOS 18.x, but you'll have to erase and restore your phone.\nTo turn on Adaptive Power Mode:\n- After iOS 26 is installed, open the Settings app.\n- Tap Battery.\n- Scroll down towards the bottom of the screen and tap Power Mode.\n- Flip the Adaptive Power toggle.\nRemember, leave Low Power Mode off unless you need to stretch out your battery life as long as possible -- i.e. you might not make it to a charger in time otherwise. It's a much harsher measure, and you can always flip it on later via the battery icon in Control Center, or wait for iOS to prompt you when you're running on fumes.\n3 tiny tweaks to simplify your desktop's USB situation\nThere's no need for a modern Mac or PC setup to be a nest of wires.\nDoes Adaptive Power Mode tell us anything about future iPhones?\nSaving face, or genuinely nice?\nIt's hard not to speculate that the feature exists because of the iPhone 17 Air, also expected this fall. Recently, one report claimed that Apple's own testing found that only 60 to 70% of owners will be able to get through a day on a single charge, which compares with 80 to 90% for other iPhone models. Adaptive Power Mode may be a way of masking the Air's deficiencies, simply in a way that benefits most other iPhone users too.\nIndeed, I'm looking forward to this option being standard on my iPhone 16 Pro. It's usually capable of reaching the end of the day with power to spare, but I sometimes end up in the red, say if it's a gym day, and I've also been watching Reuters and wheeling around using wireless CarPlay.\nAdaptive Power Mode may be a way of masking the iPhone 17 Air's deficiencies, simply in a way that benefits most other iPhone users too.\nThe weak battery life on the Air is said to be linked to its ultra-thin dimensions, as with Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge. Contrary to predictions, the Edge didn't use a silicon-carbon battery to compensate for its size, and Apple seems poised to go the same route. I wouldn't be surprised to see this fixed in the 2026 Air -- but for the initial version, you may have to care more about size and weight than anything else. At least there should be more conventional iPhone 17 models to satisfy those of us who already push battery life to the limit.\nEverything you need to know about PEVs, or personal electric vehicles\nYou can use PEVs like e-bikes and scooters to explore, run errands, or speed up your commute."

      "text": "Traditional security cameras have one major flaw - the inability to monitor every inch of your property. Even the most sophisticated security cameras with wide-angle lenses lead to blind spots that can be manipulated by unwelcome guests. With traditional security cameras, the only way to eliminate blind spots is to install multiple cameras in every space to target different angles, which can be pretty expensive and inconvenient. Pan-and-tilt cameras, meanwhile, allow you to cover every angle of your property to eliminate all blind spots.\nEZVIZ has recently unveiled the C8W Pro, one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated pan-and-tilt cameras. Unlike traditional security cameras, the C8W Pro uses artificial intelligence and human detection features to pan toward the source of movement. Instead of purchasing several security cameras for different angles, you can cover all angles with one camera. In addition to the C8W Pro, you can also find other pan-and-tilt cameras in the C8 line of security cameras.\nThis article describes the most attractive features of the EZVIZ C8W Pro pan-and-tilt camera.\nEliminate all blind spots with 360-degree panoramic vision\nEZVIZ C8W Pro is a security camera with a 2K resolution and 360\u00b0 panoramic coverage. The device\u2019s pan-and-tilt mechanism works with motion detection and human detection features to give you a complete picture of the surroundings. The device features 340\u00b0 horizontal rotation and 80\u00b0 vertical rotation features, which is enough to cover all possible angles. When combined with motion detection and auto-tracking features, the 360\u00b0 panoramic vision truly comes to life.\nIdentify moving people and vehicles with AI\nEZVIZ C8W Pro features a powerful artificial intelligence algorithm that can identify movements from people and vehicles. Instead of focusing solely on motion, which can also occur because of trembling leaves or insects, C8W Pro\u2019s AI focuses on the shape of vehicles and humans. As such, the C8W Pro eliminates false alerts from inanimate objects. You can also customize detection zones to eliminate movements from certain areas, such as the street.\nAutomatically follow human movements\nThe C8W Pro can lock into the areas registering movement from humans and vehicles. Once it has locked into the source of movement, the camera rotates to follow the human\u2019s movement and record the activity. You can use this feature to follow the activities of your pets or loved ones. And if an intruder enters or comes close to your property, you can rest assured that the camera will follow their movements.\nPinpoint multiple preferred viewing angles\nOne of the problems people have with traditional pan-and-tilt cameras is that they don\u2019t always return to the most important angles. But the C8W Pro allows you to program up to 12 angles of importance. No matter how complex the tracking, the camera\u2019s lens will focus on the most important angles, such as your home\u2019s entry and exit points. Even after following movements, it will always return to the angles of interest.\nInteract with visitors or potential intruders\nThe C8W Pro comes with an inbuilt microphone that allows you to communicate with potential intruders, visitors, or delivery agents. You can simply speak into your smartphone app, allowing you to communicate with the visitors. This is the ideal means of scaring off potential intruders or talking to delivery agents. You can inform your delivery agents where you want them to place your packages or if you have any other instructions.\nProtect your home at night with dynamic night vision\nThe C8W Pro has dynamic night vision with three powerful modes - full-colour night vision, black-and-white night vision, and smart night vision. The camera features two inbuilt spotlights that provide full-colour night vision. If you don\u2019t want the spotlights turned on, you can switch to infrared night vision, which provides up to 30 meters of black and white vision. Or you can use smart night vision, which turns into colour night vision when human movements are detected.\nDefend your property with loud sirens and spotlights\nThe C8W Pro features an active defence feature that allows you to protect your property from potential intruders. When the camera\u2019s human and motion detection sensors identify intruders, the camera starts blaring a loud siren and flashes two spotlights. This is the most effective means of scaring off intruders and preventing them from entering your property.\nOther pan-and-tilt cameras from EZVIZ\nEZVIZ C8PF\n- Intelligent dual lenses for optimal colour correction\n- 360\u00b0 panoramic coverage with pan-and-tilt functionality\n- Picture-in-picture display mode to compare live and recorded footage\n- Ultra HD 8x mixed zoom for optimal vision\n- AI-powered human shape detection for precise alerts\n- Inbuilt two-way intercom\n- Up to 30 meters of infrared night vision\nEZVIZ C8C\n- 1080p resolution with H.265 video technology\n- 360\u00b0 panoramic coverage with pan-and-tilt functionality\n- 352\u00b0 horizontal rotation and 95\u00b0 vertical rotation\n- AI-powered human shape detection for precise alerts\n- Inbuilt two-way intercom\n- Three-night vision modes - full colour, black-and-white, or smart\nEZVIZ C8W Pro is undoubtedly one of the most powerful and sophisticated pan-and-tilt cameras on the market. In addition to eliminating blind spots, the motorized pan-and-tilt mechanism works with AI human detection and auto-tracking features to ensure optimal precision of footage. If you\u2019re looking for an advanced security camera that potential intruders can\u2019t evade, the EZVIZ C8 series is worth considering.\nView offer on Amazon US | Amazon DE | Amazon FR | Amazon NL | Amazon ES"

      "text": "Summary\n- There are few cars remaining with a manual transmission due to electrified powertrains.\n- The majority of manuals are expensive performance-based models, but there are affordable options.\n- Manual transmissions in cars provide drivers with engaging and fun driving experiences, and are more secure.\n- One of the cheapest new cars available in the US has a manual transmission as standard.\nBetween hybrid and electric vehicles, and people preferring a stress-free driving experience, manual transmissions are slowly but surely becoming extinct. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a good automatic transmission. In fact, there are several automatic sports cars that don't make me miss a stick shift, but there's a magical connection between the road and the driver through a manual transmission.\nOn top of that, owning a manual car can bring passive safety and security. Since most Americans never learned to drive a stick, the chances of a manual car being stolen are lowered. They also keep your brain engaged as you shift up and down gears, compared to simply cruising along in a daze.\nMost cars left with a stick tend to be sports cars, so, while this list showcases the most affordable new cars that are available with a manual transmission, some of them are expensive. That said, they are all under $40,000, which is much less than a fully-loaded Honda Odyssey. Plus, there's a huge drop in price between second and first place on this list -- which happens to be the cheapest new car you can buy.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites. This list focuses on cars, excluding SUVs and trucks. Rankings are based on starting MSRP for manual transmission models, from most to least expensive.\nThis is the cheapest EV you can buy new right now\nYou're making some sacrifices to beat Tesla and Chevy on price.\n10 2025 Toyota GR Corolla\nStarting MSRP: $38,650\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, the first entry on our list isn't exactly cheap, but you can get a popular rally-inspired hot hatch with a manual transmission for less than $40,000. Essentially, the Gazoo Racing team matched a four-wheel-drive system to a manual gearbox and squeezed 300 hp from a three-cylinder engine to create a road-legal rally car for the masses. No wonder it's so popular.\n9 2025 Acura Integra\nStarting MSRP: $38,000\nThe return of the Acura Integra was a significant moment for the brand and enthusiasts. Unlike the controversial comeback of the Toyota Supra, which is essentially a BMW Z4, the Integra has stayed true to its heritage with Honda Civic DNA.\nIt comes with a CVT automatic transmission as standard, but the A-spec with Technology trim is available with a six-speed manual. The Integra Type S is manual-only with a bigger engine, but starts at $52,900, so it didn't make this list.\n8 2025 Subaru WRX\nStarting MSRP: $37,750\nAnother car with a rich history in motorsport is the Subaru WRX. Although the 2025 model isn't as pure as its predecessors, this WRX can still be raced on a rally stage with Subaru's famous four-wheel drive system as standard. That said, most of these will probably stay clean on the road. Regardless, owners will have plenty of fun working through the six-speed manual gearbox.\n10 affordable used cars that can keep up with a Porsche Taycan\nYou don't need to spend $100k for a fast car. These sedans put Porsche to shame.\n7 2025 Hyundai Elantra N\nStarting MSRP: $34,350\nThe Hyundai Elantra N is an underrated car, and it's a shame. Not everyone loves the dynamic styling, but I like the pre-fitted body kit that people would pay lots of money for anyway.\nAs well as being one of the few cars left with a manual transmission, it's a short-shift, making gear changes quicker -- ideal for racing more expensive cars. The N division don't care how cheap the car will cost when completed; their only goal is to make the best performance car they can within a set budget.\n6 2025 Volkswagen Jetta GLI\nStarting MSRP: $32,715\nVolkswagen decided to cut the stick from the 2025 Jetta line-up, probably to save money on manufacturing costs. However, the performance-based Jetta GLI was saved from the axe. It uses a six-speed manual gearbox paired with a small but mighty 228-horsepower engine.\nIf the Elantra N looked a bit wild, this more mature German sedan will be to your taste.\n5 2025 Honda Civic Si\nStarting MSRP: $30,995\nAnother staple car in America that now requires an upgrade to get a manual is the Honda Civic.

      "text": "Summary\n- Tesla's Autopilot is an optional driver assistance system that includes features like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.\n- Enhanced Autopilot, available as an add-on purchase, includes additional features like Navigate on Autopilot and Autopark.\n- Full Self-Driving, currently in beta, is a higher-tier add-on that includes everything in Autopilot and Enhanced Autopilot, along with capabilities like Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control.\nTesla vehicles have some self-driving or autonomous capabilities through a bundle of features, called Autopilot, which should only be used with a fully attentive driver. If you want to get Autopilot for your Tesla vehicle or want to learn more, including how it works, bookmark this guide.\nWhat is Tesla Autopilot?\nTesla's Autopilot is an optional driver assistance system that's available in all Tesla vehicles. There are three different tiers: Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. The core Autopilot features include Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer.\nEnhanced Autopilot is available as an add-on purchase, currently priced at $6,000, and it includes Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, Autopark, Summon and Smart Summon. Full Self-Driving, currently in beta, is a $15,000 add-on purchase that includes everything in Autopilot and Enhanced Autopilot, along with Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control, and Autosteer on City Streets.\nAll of those features mean your Tesla can steer, turn, accelerate, and brake - all autonomously and automatically, either within a given lane, or from a starting point to your final destination, depending on which level of Autopilot you have access to and are currently using.\nThe Autopilot name is a little misleading, as it requires driver supervision and does not make your vehicle \"fully\" autonomous. Tesla monitors whether or not your paying attention with a camera located above the rearview mirror, as well as monitors for pressure on the steering wheel to ensure your hands are on the wheel at all times.\nTesla regularly releases over-the-air software updates to improve and evolve the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving over time.\nWhich vehicles have Autopilot?\nAny Tesla built in 2016 or later has all the necessary hardware required by Autopilot. From 2016 until late 2021, that means the car includes 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, vision processing tools, an onboard computer, and more.\nStarting in 2021, Tesla began removing ultrasonic sensors from the Model 3 and Model Y, and in 2022 the transition away from the sensors was completed by removing them from the Model X and Model S. Instead of using the radar-like sensors, Tesla is relying completely on the cars' cameras to measure distance. Even without the ultrasonic sensors, you're still able to use Tesla's Autopilot features, up to an including Full Self-Driving.\nHow much is Autopilot?\nAutopilot is included with the purchase of any new Tesla, with optional add-ons for Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving. Their prices are as follows:\nAutopilot\nPrice: Included in the purchase price of new Teslas. If you're buying a used Tesla that lacks Autopilot, the price will vary.\nEnhanced Autopilot\nPrice: $6,000 add-on at the time of vehicle purchase or after purchase.\nFull Self-Driving capability\nPrice: $15,000 add-on at the time of vehicle purchase. Alternatively, you can sign up for a month-to-month subscription to enable Full Self-Driving for $99 a month if you have Enhanced Autopilot, or $199 if you have access to basic Autopilot. The subscription can be started and stopped as often as you'd like.\nWhat features are included with Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and FSD?\nHere are the main features for each of the two add-on Autopilot packages you can purchase for your Tesla vehicle. Keep in mind, these features are in addition to the standard Autopilot features of:\nTraffic-Aware Cruise Control: Matches the speed of your Tesla vehicle with traffic.\nAutosteer: Assists in steering and keeping your car within a lane. Used in combination with traffic-aware cruise control.\nEnhanced Autopilot\nNavigate on Autopilot: Actively guides your Tesla vehicle from a highway's on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting and making lane changes, navigating interchanges, automatically engaging the turn signal, and taking the exit.\nAuto Lane Change: Assists in moving to an adjacent lane on the highway when Autosteer is engaged.\nAutopark: Helps automatically parallel or perpendicular park your Tesla vehicle.\nSummon: Moves your Tesla vehicle in and out of a tight space using the app.\nSmart Summon: You can summon your Tesla to pick you up at a store's entryway. The car will navigate the parking lot on its own.\nFull Self-Driving capability\nTraffic and Stop Sign Control (Beta): Identifies stop signs and traffic lights and slows your Tesla vehicle to a stop on approach, with your active supervision.\nAutosteer on City Streets: This feature is listed as coming soon on Tesla's website, but anyone who paid for Full Self-Driving can use a beta version of the feature. Once enabled, your Tesla will autonomously navigate all streets, stop signs and stop lights, including making turns, and lane changes to take you from point A to point B.\nHow do you buy Tesla Autopilot?\nYou can purchase Autopilot at any time through your Tesla account, either on the website or via the mobile app. Once the purchase is complete, you may need to install a software on your car to enable the unlocked features. Otherwise, the features will be available shortly after purchase.\nHow do you operate Autopilot?\nWe recommend you read your vehicle's owner manual for detailed information. But we've outlined how to turn on some of Autopilot's core features below.\nEnable Autopilot\nThe only Autopilot feature that's enabled for each driver profile on a Tesla is Traffic-Aware Cruise Control. You'll need to manually enable each feature and agree to Tesla's terms before you can use them. You can find the Autopilot settings by tapping on the vehicle icon in your Tesla's screens taskbar, followed by selecting Autopilot from the menu.\nWhen you enable features like Autosteer and Full Self-Driving you will need to agree to Tesla's sternly worded warning that reminds you're expected to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and to be prepared to take over at any time.\nTraffic-Aware Cruise Control\nTo use Traffic-Aware Cruise Control in a Model 3 or Model Y, pull down once on the drive stalk located on the right side of the steering wheel. For the Model S and Model X, pull down once on the cruise control stalk on the left of the steering column.\nAutosteer\nTo use Autosteer in Model S and Model X, pull toward you twice on the cruise control stalk on the steering column. In Model 3 and Model Y, pull down twice on the gear selector stalk on the right of the steering column.\nNote: A steering wheel icon will appear on your display when Autosteer is available. A blue steering wheel icon will appear when it is engaged.\nNavigate on Autopilot\nTo start using this feature, you must first enable Autosteer (Controls > Autopilot > Autosteer) and then enable the Navigate on Autopilot feature. You'll need to enter a destination in order for Navigate on Autopilot to be available. You can then either press the Navigate on Autopilot button in your Navigation Turn List, or set Navigate on Autopilot to automatically turn on when it's available.\nOn Model 3 and Model Y, Navigate on Autopilot can be used on most highways by moving the gear lever twice downward. On Model S and Model X, Navigate on Autopilot can be engaged on most highways by pulling the cruise stalk toward you twice.\nAuto Lane Change\nTo initiate an automated lane change, you must enable Auto Lane Changes through the Autopilot menu. Then, when the car is driving in Autosteer mode, you can press the turn signal up or down to turn on your blinker, and the car will make a lane change once it's clear.\nAutopark\nWhen your Tesla is moving slow enough and it detects a parking spot, you'll see a grey P icon will appear on your instrument panel.\nTo use Autopark, press on the brake, shift the gear selector into Reverse, and keep your foot on the brake. Start Autopark will appear in blue text on your touchscreen. Press it to start, which will then prompt you to release the brake and loosen your grip on the steering wheel.\nAutopark will begin to control the vehicle. Once Autopark is complete, the car will let you know it is done and shift into Park.\nYou can override Autopark at any time by taking control of the steering wheel.\nSummon\nTo use Summon, open the Tesla app. Press Summon and then press the forward or reverse buttons. Model S and Model X owners can use Summon with their key fob by holding the center of the key fob for 3 seconds until the car's hazard lights come on and then pressing either the frunk or trunk button on the fob to Summon forward and backward.\nSmart Summon\nSmart Summon is designed to allow your car to drive to you or a location of your choosing. It is only intended for use in private parking lots and driveways.\nTo use Smart Summon, open your Tesla app, then tap Summon, and select the Smart Summon icon. To actually activate the feature, press and hold the Go to Target button. Or, tap the target icon, then set the target destination of your choice by adjusting the map, and press and hold the Go to Target button.\nTraffic Light and Stop Sign Control (Beta)\nTraffic Light and Stop Sign Control identifies stop signs and traffic lights and slows your car to a stop. To enable it, shift your car into Park and tap Controls > Autopilot > Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (Beta). Then, whenever you engage Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer, the car will stop for lights and signs.\nCan you try Autopilot before purchasing?\nYes. You can experience Autopilot on a test drive at one of Tesla's store locations.\nWant to know more?\nWe recommend checking out these Tesla webpages for more information:"
