      "feedback": "Your draft captures the key Fed‑cut narrative and ACM’s upside but falls short on several fronts: 1) **Causal chain depth** – you mention “Fed cut + small‑cap valuation narrowing” but never explain how the cut translates into a 12× P/E rebound or why ACM’s revenue guidance hinges on that; add a brief mechanism (e.g., lower discount rates → higher NPV for capital‑intensive firms → higher demand for advanced‑node equipment). 2) **Scenario specificity** – the “Down” lines are vague; replace “Fed cut postponed + U.S.–China trade tensions” with concrete triggers (e.g., “Fed minutes show no cut and CPI > 2.8%” and “China‑US trade talks stall”) and attach probabilities grounded in the cited sources. 3) **Quantification** – you quote a 60% probability but never justify it; use the 10‑year yield (4.23%) and Treasury Secretary’s 150‑bp call (C22MKA9VY) to estimate a 55–65% chance of a September cut, and adjust the 50% for ACM’s revenue guidance based on its Q2 revenue growth rate (≈30% YoY). 4) **Citation density** – each claim needs an ID; your swing‑trade line cites three IDs but the probability and confidence statements lack citations. 5) **Trade plan format** – the “Swing Trade” line is too long; split into two lines if you need to include both entry/stop and target/stop‑loss, but keep each line under 20 words. 6) **Alignment with SECTION FOCUS** – you only produce one swing trade; the instruction allows up to two lines, but you should also include a second line for a “short” scenario (e.g., if the Fed cuts later than September, ACM could underperform). 7) **Risk/invalidations** – list specific invalidation points (e.g., “Fed cuts delayed beyond Sep 2025” and “CPI > 2.8% in Aug”) and tie them to the probability of the down scenario. 8) **Confidence** – justify the 70% confidence with a brief reference to ACM’s 49% gross margin and 23% debt‑to‑equity ratio (SK994CBWR). 9) **Avoid generic platitudes** – replace “moderate‑high confidence” with a numeric range (e.g., “confidence 70–80% based on margin stability and low leverage”). 10) **Reconcile conflicts** – if any source contradicts your probability (e.g., a source suggesting a 30% chance of a cut), note the discrepancy and adjust. 11) **Length/format** – keep the final output to the required 4 mover lines and 1–2 trade lines, no extra commentary. Implement these edits to elevate the analysis to world‑class quality.",
