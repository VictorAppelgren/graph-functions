      "feedback": "Your draft falls short on several fronts: it glosses over the causal chain that links macro‑policy shifts (e.g., UAS‑related export controls, federal R&D subsidies, and the 2025 U.S. “Clean Air” standards) to the 3–6‑month transmission of job growth and wage inflation in the Grand Forks UAS cluster; it also treats the dividend‑stock and Toyota‑RAV4 sections as isolated anecdotes rather than integrated scenarios. To reach world‑class quality, (1) anchor every claim in the source IDs (e.g., cite FOM34PUWA for the 1,400 UAS jobs and $105,912 salary, U0I2AFHOV for the 16.7% Pfizer yield and 8.8% AbbVie CAGR, WISLWAJ15 for the 6.7% Pfizer yield, GUJQZY4UO for the 60% customer concentration, and H8880U45S for the 111,526 hybrid RAV4 sales and 3.6% decline) and weave them into a coherent 3–6‑month scenario map with explicit triggers (e.g., “Q3 2025 UAS export‑control tightening → 5% drop in North Dakota contract volume → 2% wage compression”) and invalidations (e.g., “if federal R&D budget increases by 10% → UAS job growth accelerates by 3%”). (2) Structure the analysis into a base case, 1–2 alternative paths, and a risk matrix, each with quantified ranges (e.g., dividend payout ratio 100–120% for AbbVie, RAV4 hybrid sales 45–55% of total). (3) Use first‑principles for fundamentals: explain why a 53‑year dividend streak implies a low payout risk, why a 6.7% yield on a low P/E (8.3) signals sustainability, and why Toyota’s shift to hybrid‑only in 2026 will compress gross margins by ~2% but boost EV‑related tax credits. (4) Replace generic statements (“good performance”) with hard numbers (e.g., “AbbVie’s free cash flow $18.2 bn vs dividends $11.3 bn → 62% coverage”). (5) Ensure every critical source is cited; reconcile conflicts (e.g., FOM34PUWA’s 97% UAS job rise vs local data gaps) by noting data limitations and suggesting a conservative 10% adjustment. (6) Format the final piece as a concise 800‑word report with bullet‑point catalysts, a 3‑column table of key metrics, and a confidence rating (e.g., “High” for dividend stability, “Medium” for UAS job growth). This will elevate depth, clarity, and actionable insight.",
