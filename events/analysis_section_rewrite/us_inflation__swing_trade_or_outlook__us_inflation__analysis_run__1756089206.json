Move all four movers to a clean four-scenario regime map with explicit, testable triggers (FOMC/CPI, regulatory milestones, ETF/inflows) and avoid mixing in lengthy private-market abstracts unless tightly tied to ETH’s value drivers. Ground each line in a strict first-principles chain: from regime driver (lower/higher discount rates) to observable catalyst (inflation path, policy signals, on‑ramp/regulatory clarity) to price-path implication (ETH valuations). Normalize time horizon to 3–6 months across lines and unify probability budgeting (e.g., 60–65% for Up, 35–40% for Down) with explicit confidence. Use exact, source-backed entry/exit levels only where cited (avoid vague “near highs” without a numeric anchor). Ensure every numeric claim has a source citation; reconcile any conflicts between sources (e.g., debt ranges vs. regime triggers) before finalizing. Finally, trim non-crypto ballast (private-market memos, Ford-cycle analogies) unless tightly integrated into the crypto thesis, and present a tight 1-line Swing Trade with explicit entry/stop/target/invalidations for rapid operability.",
