  "content": "We may have new hope in the battle against Alzheimer's disease. Researchers have found that lithium levels in the brain are closely linked to the condition, and that lithium supplements can reverse Alzheimer's-like memory loss in mice.\n\nLed by a team from Harvard Medical School, the researchers wanted to investigate previous links that have been made between exposure to metals and dementia risk.\n\nThrough hundreds of donated brain tissue and blood samples taken from people with advanced Alzheimer's, early-stage mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and no cognitive issues at all, the team ran tests for dozens of different metals.\n\nRelated: These 4 Distinct Patterns May Signal Alzheimer's According to Science\n\nOnly one metal showed significant differences in abundance between these groups: lithium. Reduced levels of this metal were also noticeable at the earliest stages of memory loss in the tested samples.\n\n\"The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer's disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach,\" says geneticist and neurologist Bruce Yankner, from Harvard Medical School.\n\nWhile lithium is widely used to treat bipolar disorder, this is the first time it's been found to be naturally present in the brain.\n\n\"Lithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and vitamin C,\" says Yankner. \"It's the first time anyone's shown that lithium exists at a natural level that's biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug.\"\n\nFurther analysis revealed that the amyloid-beta protein clumps that accompany Alzheimer's seemed to be binding to lithium in the brain, making less of it available to neurons and further accelerating the progression of the disease.\n\nNext, the researchers ran tests on mice, finding that depriving their brains of lithium dramatically increased the clumps of amyloid-beta in their brains. The amount of another Alzheimer's-related protein called tau also increased.\n\nEven better, the researchers found that a certain type of lithium, lithium orotate, could evade capture by amyloid-beta proteins. When small doses of it were given to mice with Alzheimer's-like symptoms, the animals' memory function was restored, and other signs of cognitive decline were effectively reversed.\n\nThere are still plenty of questions left unanswered, as is often the case with Alzheimer's, which is an incredibly complex disease. At the moment, it's not clear how levels of lithium begin to drop, for example, and how that then leads to signs of dementia.\n\nFurther studies should help to clarify that, and clinical trials are the next significant step. Eventually, Alzheimer's could be diagnosed earlier by measuring patients' lithium levels, while lithium supplements could be a useful preventative or treatment.\n\nWith the number of people with dementia on the rise, there's an urgent need to find ways of protecting the brain against the devastating consequences of the condition.\n\n\"You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial, but so far the results are very encouraging,\" says Yankner.\n\nThe research has been published in Nature.",

      "text": "Moods and emotions play an important role in our day-to-day life.\nThey even influence how we experience things \u2013 for instance, whether we start the day feeling hopeful and energised or grumpy and lethargic. This can affect whether we interpret events in a positive or negative light.\nIn people with bipolar disorder, however, mood can change quickly and unpredictably, so that you get \"stuck\" in a low or high mood, which can have significant consequences.\nYet researchers don't know exactly what drives such extreme shifts in mood.\nNow our new study, published in Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science, has uncovered the brain areas that bias mood and the brain's response to pleasure in bipolar disorder.\nIt is possible that our findings may one day lead to better treatments.\nWe all experience shifts in mood throughout the day. When we are in a good mood, we tend to view things more favourably \u2013 if we happen to experience a streak of success and are on a roll, our good mood similarly rolls over and gains momentum.\nEqually, when we are in a bad mood, we tend to perceive bad outcomes as even worse than they are \u2013 this negative mood similarly gains momentum and might make us feel worse.\nSuch momentum in mood can bias how we perceive events and the decisions we make.\nImagine going into a new restaurant for the first time. If you happen to be in a fantastic mood, you are likely to perceive the experience as much better than it actually is.\nThis might set up your expectations that a future visit would give you a similar, positive experience, and leave you feeling disappointed if that is not the case.\nThe process by which mood biases the perception of pleasurable or rewarding experiences has been thought to be amplified for people with bipolar disorder, who can experience moods that can quickly climb to extremes.\nWe know from prior research that these extreme mood cycles can be triggered from life experiences involving important goals \u2013 such as doing well in exams, buying a property or getting a promotion. This could be either by attaining them or failing to attain them.\nBipolar disorder has been described by those who experience it as a double-edged sword. Alongside periods of fluctuating (hypo)manic or depressive moods, many people with bipolar disorder vigorously pursue goals that are important to them and are often successful as a result.\nBut what goes on in the brain when our moods shift from one second to the next in response to pleasurable experiences?\nMood bias in the brain\nPleasurable and rewarding experiences activate specific circuits in the brain that involve a neurochemical called dopamine. This helps us learn that the experience was positive and that we should repeat the actions that give rise to this pleasurable experience.\nOne way to measure the brain's response to reward is to examine activity in the ventral striatum \u2013 the key area of our reward system responsible for the feeling of pleasure.\nOur study aimed to find out what goes on in the ventral striatum in 21 participants with bipolar disorder and 21 control participants when momentary shifts in mood occur. We wanted to gauge this down to the order of seconds, in response to monetary rewards.\nOur participants were asked to play a computer game, involving gambling to win or lose real sums of money, while in a brain scanner. We used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure blood flow in the participants' brains in order to determine which areas were active.\nWe also used a mathematical model to calculate participants' \"momentum\" in mood \u2013 how great they felt as they kept winning.\nAcross all participants, we observed a heightened brain activity in an area of the brain which is involved in the experience and awareness of transient mood states \u2013 the anterior insula.\nHowever, it turns out that during periods of upwards momentum, where participants had won many times, the ventral striatum showed a strong, positive signal only in participants with bipolar disorder. This means that participants with bipolar disorder experienced a heightened feeling of reward.\nWe also found that the amount of communication between the ventral striatum and anterior insula was reduced in participants with bipolar disorder. In the control group, both the ventral striatum and anterior insula were firing up in union.\nThis suggests that control participants were better able to keep their mood in mind when perceiving rewards in the task.\nSo while participants may find it rewarding to win, we think they were more aware that this put them in a better mood.\nThis might help them adjust quickly to an environment that changes (for the better or worse) and protect them from expectations of getting a future reward becoming very inflated.\nHowever, this was the opposite for participants with bipolar disorder. This means they were less able to set their mood aside from how exciting or pleasurable they found the rewards to be.\nThese findings may help to explain why people with bipolar disorder can get stuck in a vicious cycle where their mood escalates and sometimes causes them to take bigger risks than usual.\nThe same mechanism that triggers a positive mood may also trigger a negative mood cycle. If you are on a winning streak and lose unexpectedly, mood may shift towards a negative cycle, with expectations becoming negative and behaviour changing accordingly.\nHowever future studies will need to investigate negative mood cycles more specifically.\nOur findings may also aid the development of interventions that help people with bipolar disorder to better decouple their mood from their perceptions and decisions, without dampening down exciting experiences.\nSince dopamine neurons are closely connected to the ventral striatum, it will be interesting to see if dopamine medication could ameliorate this mood bias.\nHestia Moningka, Clinical Fellow of Psychology, UCL\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "An analysis of the genetic activity of brain cells in individuals who have died with Alzheimer's disease has revealed the condition progresses in two stages; a slow increase in inflammation, followed by a more rapid degeneration.\nImportantly, the first of these phases is limited in its scope and happens before symptoms such as memory loss appear, indicating opportunities for diagnosis and treatment could occur at an earlier stage than they do currently.\nThe second stage results in a more pronounced level of destruction, featuring the notorious accumulation of protein plaques and tangles that coincide with severe damage to neurons that results in a loss of cognitive function.\nThe researchers, led by teams from the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for Brain Science, profiled the genetic acitivity of single cells in an area of the brain known as the middle temporal gyrus, where key functions of memory, language, and vision are handled.\n\"This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the specific, highly granular cell types affected over the course of disease, where those affected cells are located in tissue microarchitecture and when they are affected as disease progresses,\" write the researchers in their published paper.\nThe team analyzed brains from 84 people who had died with Alzheimer's, and who had an average age of 88. These readings and measurements were then compared to brains from donors without Alzheimer's to identify critical differences.\nIn addition to findings of distinct pathological phases, the researchers uncovered specific damage to cognitively-crucial inhibitory neuron in the first phase. This may be how problems in neural circuitry are initially triggered, the team suggests.\nIn the past, excitatory neurons \u2013 those that activate other neurons \u2013 have been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Inhibitory neurons are those that deactivate or calm neurons, so the connection to Alzheimer's here is a new and interesting one.\nThe findings provide important contributions to a comprehensive and publicly available map of the damage Alzheimier's does to the brain known as the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD). The hope is that by tracking this path of neuron destruction more closely, we can better understand how Alzheimer's is taking hold \u2013 what stops it, and what allows it to happen.\nAs our scientific technology gets more advanced and more capable, we're learning more about the complexities of Alzheimer's \u2013 whether that's with triggers elsewhere in the body, links to other diseases, or a hidden initial phase we previously hadn't discovered.\n\"The results fundamentally alter scientists' understanding of how Alzheimer's harms the brain and will guide the development of new treatments for this devastating disorder,\" says Richard Hodes, the director of the NIH National Institute on Aging, who wasn't directly involved in the study.\nThe research has been published in Nature Neuroscience."

(verify) |\nLithium orotate (C5H3LiN2O4) is a salt of orotic acid and lithium. It is marketed as a dietary supplement, and was studied between 1973\u20131986 as a treatment medical conditions such as alcoholism[1] and Alzheimer's disease.\nIt is available as the monohydrate, LiC5H3N2O4\u00b7H2O.[2] In this compound, lithium is non-covalently bound to an orotate ion, rather than to a carbonate or other ion, and like other salts, dissolves in solution to produce free lithium ions.\nWhile lithium orotate is capable of providing lithium to the body,[3] like lithium carbonate and other lithium salts, no systematic reviews support the efficacy of lithium orotate and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of any medical condition.\nEffectiveness\n[edit]In 1973, Hans Nieper reported that lithium orotate contained 3.83 mg of elemental lithium per 100 mg and lithium carbonate contained 18.8 mg of elemental lithium per 100 mg.[4] Nieper went on to claim that lithium did not dissolve from the orotate carrier until it passed through the blood\u2013brain barrier; however, a 1976 study documented that lithium concentrations within the brains of rats were not statistically different between equivalent dosages of lithium from lithium orotate, lithium carbonate, or lithium chloride.[5] However, another study in 1978 study showed that eight hours after intraperitoneal injections brain lithium concentrations of rats were significantly greater after lithium orotate than after lithium carbonate. While little serum lithium remained at 24 h after injection of 2\u00b70 m equiv kg\u22121 lithium carbonate, two\u2010thirds of the 2 h serum lithium concentration was present 24 h after lithium orotate. Furthermore, the 24 h brain concentration of lithium after lithium orotate was approximately three times greater than that after lithium carbonate. These data suggest the possibility that lower doses of lithium orotate than lithium carbonate may achieve therapeutic brain lithium concentrations and relatively stable serum concentrations.[6] A year later, Smith and Schou repeated the experiment at a higher dose (2 mM Li+) and found that the higher concentrations in the brain could be possibly accounted for by decreased renal function in rats treated with lithium orotate.[7][8] The proponents of lithium orotate have since criticized the results by citing the fact that the dose of lithium orotate used in the study was in the toxic range. In 2022, Pacholko redid the experiment and showed lithium orotate to have a safer kidney profile than lithium carbonate, it also showed that both had an increased TSH only in females, but the increase was lower in the orotate group.[9]\nThe pharmacokinetics of lithium orotate in human brains is poorly documented, and there is no known mechanism by which orotate ions could alter the pharmacokinetics of dissociated lithium ions, however, lithium intake appears to be effective even at low doses, and this may account for lithium orotate's claimed effectiveness.[10][11][12]\nThe reason why lithium orotate is poorly studied as a medication compared to lithium carbonate is concerns raised in 1979 regarding the potential amplified renal toxicity of lithium orotate in comparison to lithium carbonate.[13] These concerns were likely based on the results of the use of excessively high concentrations of lithium orotate in the studies. As a result of these concerns, the clinical application and research of lithium orotate were halted for decades since the 1980s.[13] Still, interest in lithium orotate has been rekindled, and research into its use as medication was resumed in the 2010s.[13] The renewed interest is largely due to its purported ability to achieve higher serum and brain lithium-ion (Li+) concentrations than those observed from equivalent doses of lithium carbonate, a claim first made in 1978.[13]\nSafety\n[edit]Preliminary studies seem to indicate that lithium orotate is safe if taken at lower dosages; a 6 month alcoholism cessation study led to only minor adverse effects in 8 out of 42 patients.[1] However, the lack of safety studies and the OTC status raises concerns.[8] Attention to it was specially raised in medical literature after a case report of an 18 year old woman with mild, acute lithium toxicity after taking an overdose (2.16 grams) of a lithium orotate supplement. She was discharged after treatment.[14][15][16] Lithium blood levels 90 minutes after ingestion reached 0.31 mEq/L, and an hour later after treatment, 0.40 mEq/L, levels below the serum toxicity level of 1.5 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L).[15][17]\nOrotic acid can be mutagenic in very high doses of 50 mg/kg in mammalian somatic cells.[18] It is also mutagenic for bacteria and yeast.[19] Although lithium orotate was not shown to be genotoxic,[20] short and long term studies must be performed to guarantee public safety.[8]\nResearch directions\n[edit]There is weak evidence administration of lithium orotate may be useful in aiding alcohol cessation.[21]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b Sartori HE (1986). \"Lithium orotate in the treatment of alcoholism and related conditions\".

      "text": "Alzheimer's disease is often thought of as a condition that only affects the elderly.\nBut around 3.9 million people worldwide aged 30-64 live with young-onset Alzheimer's disease \u2013 a form of dementia in which symptoms appear before the age of 65.\nEnglish journalist and broadcaster Fiona Phillips, 62, recently revealed that she'd been diagnosed with it. In the interview, Phillips shared that the main symptoms she had experienced before her diagnosis were brain fog and anxiety \u2013 highlighting just how different young-onset can be from late-onset Alzheimer's disease.\nFirst, symptoms begin much earlier \u2013 as young as 30 in some rare cases, though it's typically diagnosed between the ages of 50-64.\nAnd, while people with Alzheimer's disease commonly experience memory loss as the first sign of the disease, people with young-onset Alzheimer's tend to have other symptoms \u2013 such as worse attention, less ability to mimic hand gestures and worse spatial awareness.\nSome people with young-onset Alzheimer's may also experience an increase in anxiety prior to their diagnosis. This may be due to an awareness of the changes occurring, without a clear reason as to why they're feeling different.\nThey may think these changes in behaviour are temporary, which can put people off seeking medical help. Healthcare professionals may also misinterpret anxiety as a sign of other health conditions.\nBut while they may have less cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis, studies have indicated that those living with young-onset Alzheimer's disease show more rapid changes in their brain.\nThis indicates that the condition can be more aggressive than late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This may also explain why people with early-onset Alzheimer's tend to have a life expectancy around two years shorter than those with late-onset.\nResearch shows that people with young-onset Alzheimer's are also more aware of the changes in their brain activity. This can lead to behavioural changes \u2013 with conditions such as depression being prevalent in this group.\nWithin the brain itself, young-onset Alzheimer's disease causes similar chemical changes as those in late-onset Alzheimer's. But the brain areas targeted by these chemical changes can be different.\nResearch has found that brain areas involved in processing sensory- and movement-related information (called the parietal cortex) show greater signs of damage. There is also less damage to the hippocampus compared to late-onset Alzheimer's \u2013 an area of the brain important in learning and memory.\nWhy it happens\nThe risk factors for young-onset Alzheimer's disease are similar to those for late-onset Alzheimer's.\nFor example, poor levels of cardiovascular fitness and lower cognitive ability in early adulthood have been linked to an eight-fold increased risk of developing young-onset Alzheimer's. However, we are yet to fully understand all the factors that influence a person's chances of developing the condition.\nOne aspect experts are clear on is that genetics play a role in about one in ten cases of young-onset Alzheimer's disease. So far, three genes (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2) have been linked to young onset Alzheimer's disease.\nThese genes are all related to a toxic protein that is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's disease (known as amyloid beta). When these genes become faulty, there's an accumulation of toxic amyloid beta, which is linked to symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\nGrowing evidence suggests there may also be a link between traumatic brain injury and young-onset Alzheimer's disease.\nWhat can people do?\nIn the UK, people diagnosed with young-onset Alzheimer's disease can be prescribed medication which can help manage symptoms.\nBut in the US, two therapies have been approved which may slow the progression of symptoms. However, these were only tested on people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, so it's uncertain if they will have as distinct of an effect.\nPeople who may have a family history of dementia or are concerned about their risk can have a genetic test done through a private company. This will confirm the presence of the faulty genes. These tests can be carried out for those showing symptoms, or those with a family history that wish to know their future prognosis.\nWhile it's not possible to modify genetics if you are at greater risk, some research does support the idea that you can strengthen your resilience against the disease through a healthier lifestyle.\nOne study found that when people who were genetically predisposed to early onset Alzheimer's exercised for more than two-and-a-half hours per week, they scored better in memory tests than those who weren't as physically active.\nAlongside being more active, diet choices may also lower risk of young-onset Alzheimer's. An Italian study found that people who consumed high levels of vegetables, dry fruits and chocolate appeared to have lower risk.\nMark Dallas, Associate Professor in Cellular Neuroscience, University of Reading\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Abstract\nThe earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) are poorly understood1,2,3,4,5. Here we show that endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. Of the metals we analysed, Li was the only one that was significantly reduced in the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Li bioavailability was further reduced in AD by amyloid sequestration. We explored the role of endogenous Li in the brain by depleting it from the diet of wild-type and AD mouse models. Reducing endogenous cortical Li by approximately 50% markedly increased the deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 and the accumulation of phospho-tau, and led to pro-inflammatory microglial activation, the loss of synapses, axons and myelin, and accelerated cognitive decline. These effects were mediated, at least in part, through activation of the kinase GSK3\u03b2. Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in AD. Replacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nThe identification of treatable causes of AD requires a fundamental understanding of the pathogenic processes leading to memory loss. Although substantial progress has been made in defining gene variants that confer risk for AD, the environmental factors that affect the timing of disease onset are not as well understood1,6. Several factors relating to diet, lifestyle and the environment have been identified, but their contributions to AD pathogenesis are unclear1,6,7. Altered homeostasis of metals is one such factor7,8,9,10,11,12. These studies have focused primarily on the toxic effects of metals such as iron, copper and zinc, which can promote amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation, tau phosphorylation or oxidative stress in model systems6,7,8,9,10,11,12. However, metals also have essential roles in brain function, and disruption of this normal physiology in AD is relatively unexplored.\nLithium deficiency in MCI and AD\nTo explore the role of metal-ion homeostasis in AD, we used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP\u2013MS) to assess 27 abundant and trace metals in the brain and blood of aged individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI) and individuals with amnestic MCI or AD. Metal levels were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is a prominently affected region in AD, and the cerebellum, which is relatively unaffected. Of all the metals surveyed, only one, Li, showed significantly reduced levels in the PFC of individuals with both MCI and AD (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). The mean and median Li cortex-to-serum ratio and total cortical Li were significantly reduced in the PFC of people with MCI and AD (Fig. 1c,d), but not in the cerebellum (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). In a second independent cohort, Li levels were also significantly reduced in the PFC of people with AD (Fig. 1e). By contrast, the mean serum Li levels in MCI and AD were not significantly different from controls (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Li levels were not significantly affected by sex or the range of postmortem intervals in this study (see Methods). The cortex-to-serum ratios of several other metals also changed in AD, but not in MCI (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). However, the change in Li showed the lowest adjusted P value of all the metals analysed (Fig. 1b). Together, these results indicate that endogenous Li homeostasis is perturbed in the brain in MCI and AD.\nWe next investigated whether endogenous Li homeostasis in the brain might be perturbed by AD pathology. Previous studies have implicated the interaction of several metals with A\u03b28,9. To determine whether amyloid deposition affects the distribution of Li, we performed laser absorption (LA)-ICP\u2013MS and quantified Li in amyloid plaques compared with plaque-free regions in the frontal cortex. A highly significant concentration of Li in A\u03b2 plaques was detected in every case of MCI and AD, which increased from MCI to AD (Fig. 1f). To complement this in situ analysis, PFC samples were subfractionated into a plaque-enriched insoluble fraction and a soluble fraction devoid of amyloid plaques (Supplementary Fig. 1). The mean and median Li levels in the PFC non-plaque fraction were significantly reduced in AD relative to control NCI cases (Fig. 1g). Furthermore, lower Li levels in the non-plaque cortical fraction correlated with reduced cognitive test scores for episodic and semantic memory, and for a global index of cognitive function, across the entire ageing population (Supplementary Table 2). In patients with AD, lower Li levels in the non-plaque cortical fraction correlated with reduced scores for episodic memory and the index of global cognitive function (Supplementary Table 2).\nTo further explore the relationship of Li to A\u03b2, we examined the cortical distribution of endogenous Li in J20 A\u03b2 precursor protein (App)-transgenic mice13 that exhibit widespread A\u03b2 deposition. LA-ICP\u2013MS showed an approximately 3\u20134-fold concentration of Li in cortical A\u03b2 deposits in 12-month-old J20 mice relative to adjacent plaque-free cortical regions (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Furthermore, subfractionation of the cortex showed that Li in the non-plaque cortical fraction was significantly reduced in J20 relative to wild-type mice, consistent with Li sequestration by amyloid deposits (Extended Data Fig. 1e). By contrast, 3-month-old J20 mice before the onset of amyloid deposition did not exhibit reduced Li in the soluble cortical fraction relative to age-matched wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Together, these results indicate that Li is sequestered by A\u03b2 deposits, reducing its bioavailability.\nLithium deficiency in mouse models\nTo explore the biology of endogenous Li, mice were maintained on a chemically defined diet that is calorically and nutritionally equivalent to the typical grain-based mouse diet, including the same Li concentration. Serum and cortical Li levels in mice on this diet were in a similar range to those in the ageing human population, and the mean values were not significantly different (see Methods section on Mouse diet). Selective removal of Li from the mouse diet (a 92% reduction) led to an 89% reduction in mean serum Li and a 47\u201352% reduction in mean cortical Li in the non-plaque fraction (Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013c and Supplementary Fig. 2).\nThe pathological effects of reducing endogenous Li were determined in the 3xTg AD mouse model14, which accumulates A\u03b2 deposits and phospho-tau, the J20 AD mouse model13, which accumulates abundant A\u03b2 deposits, and ageing wild-type mice without AD-type pathology. The 3xTg and J20 mice maintained on the Li-deficient diet showed a significant elevation in A\u03b2 deposition in the hippocampus (Fig. 2a,b). An increased amyloid plaque burden was observed as early as five weeks on the Li-deficient diet and continued to increase with longer-term treatment (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 2d). In ageing wild-type mice, the Li-deficient diet reduced cortical Li by approximately 50% (Extended Data Fig. 2c). This resulted in a significant elevation of cortical and hippocampal A\u03b242, the major pathogenic A\u03b2 species in AD, and a trend towards an increase in A\u03b240 (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2e). Thus, Li deficiency accelerates A\u03b2 deposition in AD mouse models and increases A\u03b242 levels in ageing wild-type mice.\nThe role of Li homeostasis in tau pathology was explored in 3xTg mice by assessing the phospho-tau isoforms associated with early (pSer202-tau) and advanced (pSer396/Ser404-tau) stages of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in AD. Both pSer202-tau and pSer396/Ser404-tau were increased 3\u20134-fold in hippocampal neurons of Li-deficient 3xTg mice (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 2f,g). A subset of the affected neurons showed elevated phospho-tau in thioflavin S-positive structures that resemble NFTs (Fig. 2f). As observed for A\u03b2, elevated phospho-tau was evident as early as five weeks into the Li-deficient diet and continued to increase with longer-term treatment (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 2f). These results indicate that Li deficiency promotes neuronal phospho-tau accumulation.\nWe next assessed whether endogenous Li affects cognitive function in the setting of AD-type pathology and during normal ageing. Administration of the Li-deficient diet to 3xTg mice significantly impaired learning (Fig. 2g) and long-term memory (Fig. 2h,i), as determined in the Morris water-maze paradigm. There were no significant changes in swimming speed, visible platform recognition or performance in the open-field test, consistent with intact visual perception, locomotor activity and exploratory behaviour (Extended Data Fig. 2h\u2013l). Li deficiency in 3xTg mice also gave rise to significant deficits in the Y-maze and novel-object recognition tests of memory (Fig. 2j,k). Furthermore, ageing Li-deficient wild-type mice also showed significant memory loss in the Morris water maze (Fig. 2m,n) and the novel-object recognition test (Fig. 2o). These cognitive deficits in ageing wild-type mice appeared in the absence of significant changes in spatial learning (Fig. 2l), swimming speed, visible platform recognition or performance in the open-field test (Extended Data Fig. 2m\u2013q). Thus, endogenous Li protects against memory loss in the presence of AD-type pathology, as well as during normal ageing in mice.\nThe transcriptome of lithium deficiency\nWe next characterized the effects of Li deficiency on the transcriptome of cell populations in the hippocampus, an early site of disease progression in MCI and AD. Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analysis of the hippocampus was done in 3xTg mice after administering the Li-deficient diet for 5 weeks. We analysed 64,772 and 54,374 high-quality nuclei from Li-deficient and control mice, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3). Based on the expression of previously validated cell-type-specific markers (Supplementary Fig. 4), the relative abundance of the resolved cell types was unchanged after 5 weeks of Li deficiency (Fig. 3a).\nAnalysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed significant transcriptome changes in excitatory, granule cell and inhibitory neurons, as well as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). In excitatory neurons, Gene Ontology (GO) terms for synaptic signalling, organization and transmission were downregulated, whereas electron transport and pathways of neurodegeneration and AD were upregulated (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Downregulated synaptic genes included Homer1, Grm3, Mef2c, Lrrk2, Grik1, Grik3, Btbd9, Dlgap3 and Dlgap4 (Fig. 3d). In oligodendrocytes, GO terms for axon ensheathment and myelination, as well as neuron projection development, were strongly downregulated (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Downregulated myelin-related genes included Mbp, Mog, Mag, Plp1 and Opalin (Fig. 3d). In astrocytes, pathways of neurodegeneration, electron transport chain and monovalent cation transport were upregulated (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in Li-deficient 3xTg mice showed significantly reduced abundance of synaptic and myelin protein components and increased abundance of proteins involved in neuroinflammation, lipid metabolism and mitochondrial membrane organization (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 7). These results indicate that endogenous Li broadly affects the composition of the brain transcriptome and proteome.\nWe next investigated whether the transcriptome of Li deficiency overlapped with that of AD by comparing our findings with a recent snRNA-seq study of cortical biopsy samples from living individuals with a range of AD pathology15. Samples from the human biopsy study that exhibited early stage A\u03b2 deposition showed cell-type-specific overlap of DEGs with 3xTg mice on a Li-deficient diet (Fig. 3e). Concordant DEGs included both upregulated and downregulated genes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, upregulated genes in microglia and OPCs, and downregulated genes in oligodendrocytes (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 8). Overlap with Li-deficient DEGs was more extensive in human cortical samples with both A\u03b2 and phospho-tau pathology that were diagnosed with AD before or within one year of biopsy15 (Fig. 3e). Concordant DEGs included both upregulated and downregulated genes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, and upregulated genes in astrocytes, endothelial cells and OPCs (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 8). Thus, the transcriptome of Li deficiency broadly overlaps with the transcriptome of AD pathology in humans.\nMaintenance of synapses and myelin\nGenes involved in synaptic signalling and structure were broadly downregulated by Li deficiency (Fig. 3c). Dendritic spine loss was detected by Golgi staining in Li-deficient 3xTg and wild-type mice (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), together with reduced immunolabelling of the presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins synaptophysin and PSD-95, respectively (Fig. 3g,h). Reduced abundance of synaptic proteins was confirmed by proteomic analysis of the Li-deficient 3xTg hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Table 7). Thus, endogenous Li contributes to synapse maintenance in the ageing mouse brain.\nLi deficiency downregulated the expression of myelin-related genes in oligodendrocytes and reduced the abundance of myelin-associated proteins (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 6b). Fluoromyelin labelling indicated a significant loss of myelin in 3xTg mice after long-term Li deficiency (Fig. 3i). This was associated with reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes, OPCs and axons in Li-deficient 3xTg and wild-type mice (Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). To assess myelin ultrastructure, transmission electron microscopy was performed on the corpus callosum in Li-deficient and control 3xTg mice (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Li-deficient mice had thinner electron-dense myelin sheaths surrounding neuronal axons and a significantly elevated g-ratio (the ratio of the inner axonal diameter to the total axon plus myelin fibre diameter), consistent with reduced axonal myelin. These results indicate that endogenous lithium contributes to the maintenance of myelin integrity.\nLithium and microglial function\nThe snRNA-seq analysis of Li deficiency showed a reduction in the number of microglia expressing the gene Cx3cr1, which encodes a homeostatic marker, and an increase in microglia expressing Apoe (Supplementary Fig. 7a), similar to the reactive microglial state observed in AD15. To obtain greater insight into the regulation of microglia by Li, viable microglia were isolated from the brain and analysed by deep RNA sequencing. Isolated microglia showed a high degree of purity and did not exhibit stress-related markers16 (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). RNA sequencing showed major transcriptome changes in microglia associated with Li deficiency in both 3xTg and wild-type mice with highly significant overlap (Supplementary Tables 9\u201312). Genes upregulated by Li deficiency in 3xTg and wild-type microglia were enriched in GO terms corresponding to AD and pathways of neurodegeneration, electron transport chain and respiration, regulation of amyloid fibril formation, translation and oxidative stress. Genes downregulated by Li deficiency were enriched in the GO terms DNA damage response, cellular response to stress, import into cell and protein catabolic process (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 12).\nTranscriptome changes in Li-deficient wild-type microglia were enriched for many risk genes for AD identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)17, including Apoe, Trem2, Bin1, Clu, Picalm, Cd33, H2-Eb1 (HLA-DRB1 orthologue), Inpp5d, Abca1, Abca7 and Adam10 (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA), false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). We also observed significant overlap of the transcriptome signature of Li-deficient microglia with that of microglia in AD, particularly for microglia that express glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) (P < 10\u221221 for 3xTg and P < 10\u221214 for wild type), which expand with the progression of AD15. Furthermore, GPNMB expression was significantly upregulated in Li-deficient microglia (Supplementary Table 11). Thus, Li deficiency alters the microglial transcriptome in a manner that overlaps with AD.\nWe next examined reactive changes in microglia following Li deficiency. Immunolabelling showed that Li deficiency increased CD68-immunoreactive microglia in 3xTg mice (Fig. 4b) and elevated microglial protein expression of GPNMB and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which are markers of microglial reactivity in AD15 (Fig. 4c). Li deficiency also increased the density of CD68+ reactive microglia in a second transgenic AD mouse model, J20 (Supplementary Fig. 7d). To explore functional changes, isolated microglia were stimulated in culture with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia from Li-deficient wild-type mice showed elevated release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF and G-CSF, as well as the immune activating chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL2 (Fig. 4d). Finally, microglia isolated from Li-deficient wild-type mice showed significantly reduced A\u03b242 uptake and subsequent degradation of A\u03b242 relative to microglia from control mice (Fig. 4e). Thus, Li deficiency leads to a reactive pro-inflammatory state and impaired A\u03b2 clearance.\nGSK3\u03b2 regulation by endogenous lithium\nWe next identified signalling pathways that are altered by Li deficiency using Ingenuity/IPA network analysis of DEGs. Wnt\u2013\u03b2-catenin signalling was significantly affected and was predicted to be repressed in microglia, excitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013c). Immunolabelling showed significantly reduced nuclear \u03b2-catenin levels in Li-deficient hippocampal CA1 neurons in 3xTg and wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Nuclear \u03b2-catenin levels were also reduced in Li-deficient oligodendrocytes and microglia (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d).\nA central regulator of \u03b2-catenin signalling is the serine-threonine kinase GSK3\u03b2, which phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Another GSK3\u03b2 substrate is tau, which is phosphorylated by GSK3\u03b2 in AD18,19,20,21 and showed 3\u20134-fold elevated phosphorylation in Li-deficient 3xTg mice (Fig. 2d,e). Li deficiency elevated total GSK3\u03b2 levels in hippocampal CA1 neurons, oligodendrocytes and microglia in 3xTg mice (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). Elevated total GSK3\u03b2 protein was confirmed by proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in Li-deficient mice (Supplementary Table 7). GSK3\u03b2 mRNA was also elevated by Li deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 5g), consistent with increased GSK3\u03b2 expression.\nGSK3\u03b2 is activated by autophosphorylation of tyrosine 216, which is increased in AD18,21. The levels of pTyr216-GSK3\u03b2 were significantly elevated by Li deficiency in hippocampal CA1 neurons and oligodendrocytes in 3xTg and wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). Phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at Ser9, which inhibits GSK3\u03b2 activity, did not change in absolute level, but the ratio of pSer9:total GSK3\u03b2 was reduced, consistent with elevated GSK3\u03b2 activity (Extended Data Fig. 5j,k). By contrast, the level of inositol, which is modulated by Li at pharmacological concentrations through inositol monophosphatase22, was not altered by endogenous Li deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 5l).\nTo assess the role of GSK3\u03b2 in the pathogenic effects of Li deficiency, the GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor CHIR99021 was administered to Li-deficient 3xTg mice. Treatment with CHIR99021 reversed the Li deficiency-associated activation of microglia (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and normalized the levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Furthermore, incubation of primary microglia from Li-deficient wild-type mice with CHIR99021 resulted in the restoration of A\u03b242 uptake and degradation (Fig. 4g). A similar outcome was achieved using a second GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor, PF-04802367 (Fig. 4g). Moreover, treatment of Li-deficient 3xTg mice with CHIR99021 reversed the elevated A\u03b2 deposition and tau phosphorylation and restored oligodendrocyte cell number and expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Extended Data Fig. 6c\u2013e). Thus, GSK3\u03b2 activation contributes to a broad range of pathology associated with Li deficiency.\nLithium replacement therapy\nThe observation that Li is sequestered by amyloid deposits in MCI and AD prompted a search for therapeutic Li salts with reduced amyloid binding. We reasoned that the electrostatic interaction of the Li ion with A\u03b2 deposits would be a function of the ionization capacity of the salt, and that Li salts with reduced ionization might show reduced amyloid sequestration. To assess ionization directly, we measured the conductivity of 16 lithium salts. Inorganic Li salts, including the clinical standard lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, hereafter LiC), showed significantly elevated conductivity, indicative of increased ionization, relative to organic Li salts (P = 8 \u00d7 10\u22124; Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Of the organic Li salts, lithium orotate (C5H3LiN2O4, hereafter LiO) showed the lowest conductance across a broad Li concentration range (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7a) and was therefore selected for further comparison with the clinical standard LiC.\nWe next investigated whether conductivity predicts Li binding to the aggregated forms of A\u03b2 that accumulate in AD. Equilibrium dialysis binding assays demonstrated that Li binds to both fibrils and oligomers formed from synthetic human A\u03b21\u201342 in vitro (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7b). Li binding was saturable and occurred in a high-affinity range that included the physiological concentration range of Li in brain and serum (0\u20132 \u00b5Eq l\u22121), as well as a lower-affinity range corresponding to clinical pharmacological doses. Notably, LiC exhibited higher binding affinity than LiO for both A\u03b242 fibrils and oligomers across a broad Li concentration range (Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Table 13).\nTo further explore the Li\u2013A\u03b2 interaction in vivo, LiO and LiC were administered to J20 and 3xTg mice at a low dose in the drinking water (4.3 \u03bcEq l\u22121 Li), resulting in a serum Li level in the physiological concentration range observed in ageing humans and mice (Supplementary Fig. 8a,c,d, Extended Data Fig. 1c and Methods). Serum and hippocampal Li levels were not significantly different after administration of low-dose LiO or LiC (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). However, Li was highly concentrated in A\u03b2 plaques after the administration of LiC, but to a much smaller extent after administration of LiO in both 3xTg and J20 mice (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). Moreover, LiO, but not LiC, significantly elevated parenchymal Li in the non-plaque fraction in 3xTg and J20 mice (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). Thus, LiO shows reduced amyloid sequestration relative to LiC and more effectively elevates non-plaque Li in the brain.\nWhen LiO was administered to adult 3xTg mice, the physiological dose almost completely prevented A\u03b2 plaque deposition and phospho-tau accumulation; by contrast, administration of LiC or the sodium orotate control had no significant effect (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). We next investigated whether LiO could reverse more-advanced pathology in ageing mice. Administration of LiO to 3xTg mice from 9 to 18 months of age significantly reduced the A\u03b2 plaque burden and the density of phospho-tau-positive NFT-like structures in the hippocampus, whereas LiC had no significant effect at the same dose (Fig. 5d). LiO also reduced the A\u03b2 plaque burden by about 70% in older J20 mice with abundant and widespread A\u03b2 deposition (Fig. 5e). Thus, LiO is highly effective at reducing A\u03b2 deposition and phospho-tau accumulation.\nLiO, but not LiC, increased the expression of the synaptic marker PSD-95 (Extended Data Fig. 8c), increased myelin-associated MBP immunoreactivity and elevated oligodendrocyte cell number (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). LiO was also more effective than LiC in suppressing microgliosis and astrogliosis in aged 3xTg mice (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). Administration of low-dose LiO, but not LiC, also reduced total GSK3\u03b2 levels in hippocampal CA1 neurons and white matter (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b), reduced the level of activated pTyr216-GSK3\u03b2 (Extended Data Fig. 9c) and elevated nuclear \u03b2-catenin (Extended Data Fig. 9d).\nRNA-seq analysis of the hippocampus of LiO-treated 3xTg mice showed downregulation of genes corresponding to the GO terms translation, electron transport chain, pathways of neurodegeneration, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, \u03b2-catenin degradation and interleukin-1 signalling, and upregulation of genes corresponding to the GO terms synapse organization and signalling, neuron projection morphogenesis and learning or memory (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Tables 14 and 15). These GO terms are similar to those associated with Li deficiency but with opposite directionality of change (Figs. 3c and 4a).\nThe effects of LiO on genes involved in learning and memory prompted us to explore cognitive function in 3xTg mice, which show memory loss relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 5g). LiO at the lowest dose (4.3 \u03bcEq l\u22121) almost completely reversed the memory loss, whereas LiC and the sodium orotate control did not show significant effects (Fig. 5g). Furthermore, LiO improved learning and spatial memory in ageing J20 mice with advanced amyloid pathology (Extended Data Fig. 10a\u2013c). LiO did not significantly affect swimming speed, visual platform localization or locomotor performance in the open-field test (Extended Data Fig. 10d\u2013h and Supplementary Fig. 9a\u2013f). Thus, LiO suppresses AD-type pathology, neuroinflammation and synapse loss, and restores memory.\nLithium and brain ageing\nTo explore the effects of Li on normal brain ageing, low-dose LiO (4.3 \u03bcEq l\u22121 Li) was administered to wild-type mice from 12 to 24 months of age. This resulted in a modest elevation of mean serum and cortical Li levels that overlap with the range of endogenous Li in untreated mice (Supplementary Fig. 10a). LiO almost completely prevented age-related microgliosis and astrogliosis in the hippocampus, cortex and corpus callosum (Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). Moreover, LiO reduced the age-related production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 (Extended Data Fig. 12a).\nMicroglia isolated from aged mice showed a marked reduction in the ability to degrade A\u03b242 relative to microglia from young adult mice. Treatment with LiO in vivo reversed this age-related loss of A\u03b2 degradative capacity (Extended Data Fig. 12b). Similar results were obtained by incubating microglial BV2 cells with LiO in culture. LiO significantly elevated A\u03b242 uptake and degradation in BV2 cells, whereas the control sodium orotate had no significant effect (Extended Data Fig. 12c\u2013e). Thus, LiO reduces age-related neuroinflammatory changes and restores the ability of microglia to clear A\u03b2.\nSynapse loss and cognitive decline are characteristic features of brain ageing in mice. Administration of LiO to wild-type mice prevented age-related loss of dendritic spines in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neurons, whereas the control salt NaO had no significant effect (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Importantly, the decline in learning and memory associated with ageing was largely reversed by LiO, as determined by tests in the Morris water maze (Extended Data Fig. 13a,b). LiO did not affect swimming speed or localization of a visible platform (Extended Data Fig. 13c,d). LiO also prevented age-related decline in novel-object recognition memory (Extended Data Fig. 13e). Notably, long-term administration of LiO to ageing wild-type, 3xTg or J20 mice did not alter serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus, low dose LiO prevents age-related pro-inflammatory changes, synapse loss and cognitive decline in mice without evidence of toxicity.\nThese observations prompted an examination of endogenous brain Li and cognitive resilience in normal ageing humans. Expression levels of the presynaptic proteins complexin 1 and 2, which regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis, predict resistance to AD23,24. Complexin 1 and 2 expression showed a highly significant positive correlation with Li cortex-to-serum ratio in aged individuals without MCI or AD (Extended Data Fig. 13f). Furthermore, cortical Li was positively correlated with cognitive test scores for working memory (P = 0.04) and performance on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE; P = 0.02). Together, these results in normal ageing mice and humans indicate that Li homeostasis may contribute to cognitive resilience.\nDiscussion\nThese observations indicate a physiological role for endogenous Li that affects brain ageing and vulnerability to AD. In humans, Li is used in psychiatry for the treatment of bipolar disorder at a dose range that raises levels in serum to approximately 1,000 times the endogenous level. We found that in normal ageing mice, low micromolar levels of endogenous Li preserve cognitive function, reduce inflammation and suppress A\u03b2 generation. In AD mouse models, endogenous Li protects against amyloid deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation and loss of synapses, axons and myelin. These effects are mediated, at least in part, through repression of the kinase GSK3\u03b2 in multiple cell types in the brain.\nMetallomic profiling of the brain also uncovered alterations in other metals that have been previously observed in AD, such as increased sodium25 and zinc26 and reduced copper12. However, decreased cortical Li was the only statistically significant metal alteration observed in both MCI and AD in our dataset. This observation is consistent with a population study in Denmark that found a significant inverse correlation between Li levels in local drinking water and the incidence of dementia27. We were able to recapitulate the reduced Li levels observed in humans with AD in mouse models with a Li-deficient diet. snRNA-seq showed that reduced cortical Li significantly alters the transcriptome of the major brain cell types. Furthermore, DEGs associated with Li deficiency in the mouse models overlapped with DEGs previously identified in snRNA-seq of human brain biopsy samples with AD pathology15. Overlapping DEGs were enriched in microglia, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, OPCs, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells and astrocytes. Consistent with these transcriptome alterations, Li deficiency resulted in deleterious effects on neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes with loss of synapses and axons, impaired A\u03b2 clearance and reduced myelination.\nLi deficiency altered microglial expression of some of the most penetrant risk-factor genes identified in GWAS studies of AD, including Apoe, Trem2, Bin1, Picalm, Clu, Cd33 and the mouse orthologues of human MS4A6A17. These expression changes were associated with elevated markers of microglial activation such as CD68, as well as increased production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are also elevated in AD28. Furthermore, Li deficiency impaired the ability of microglia to phagocytose and degrade A\u03b2, a phenotype that has been linked to A\u03b2 deposition in AD29. These findings indicate that endogenous Li maintains microglial homeostatic function and prevents pro-inflammatory changes associated with AD.\nOne of the first molecular targets of Li to be characterized at pharmacological doses was the kinase GSK3\u03b230. GSK3\u03b2 activity is increased in AD and has been implicated in A\u03b2 and tau pathology18,20,21,31. Moreover, the GSK3\u03b2 substrate \u03b2-catenin is reduced in AD18,32,33. The reported IC50 of the Li-GSK3\u03b2 interaction in vitro is in the millimolar range30, making this a seemingly unlikely interaction at the low micromolar concentration range of endogenous Li in the brain. However, our findings indicate that GSK3\u03b2 activation and expression are elevated by endogenous Li deficiency. Moreover, GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors can reverse many of the pathological consequences of Li deficiency, including A\u03b2 deposition, phospho-tau accumulation, myelination and microglial pro-inflammatory activation, as well as restoring the ability of microglia to clear A\u03b2. Previous reports have shown that GSK3\u03b2 activation can promote cytokine production in monocytic and microglial cells34 and impair oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination by inhibiting \u03b2-catenin signalling35. Together, our findings implicate increased GSK3\u03b2 activity in the multisystem effects of Li deficiency in the brain.\nTreatment with Li at pharmacologic doses has been shown to reduce A\u03b233,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45 and tau37,38,43,46,47,48,49 pathology in various neurodegenerative disease models. Similarly, Li prevented or reversed cognitive decline in several studies36,37,38,39,43,44, but not in one short-term study47. More direct evidence for a therapeutic role of Li in AD emerged from several small clinical trials. In two initial trials50,51, Li treatment did not improve cognitive function, but in three subsequent trials, Li at lower concentrations (0.25\u20130.5 mEq l\u22121 in serum) reduced cognitive decline52,53,54,55. A limitation of these clinical trials might have been the use of Li salts with high levels of amyloid binding. We have characterized a Li salt, lithium orotate, with reduced binding that can bypass amyloid sequestration in AD mouse models. Treatment with LiO at a dose that maintains serum and cortical Li levels in the endogenous range prevents and reverses AD pathology, neuroinflammatory changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. An important limitation in the treatment of aged individuals with pharmacological doses of lithium is kidney and thyroid toxicity56. It is encouraging that toxicity could not be detected following long-term treatment of ageing mice with a low dose of LiO.\nDisruption of Li homeostasis may contribute to the long prodromal period of neuropathological changes that occur prior to the onset of clinical AD. Our findings indicate that sequestration of Li by amyloid depletes Li in affected brain regions. Li depletion can, in turn, impair microglial clearance of A\u03b2, which would accelerate amyloid pathology in a positive feedback loop. In parallel, Li deficiency may promote phospho-tau accumulation, inflammation and the loss of synapses, axons and myelin. The progression of this neurodegenerative process may be modulated by genetic risk variants17,57, as well as environmental factors and dietary Li intake. Li deficiency is therefore a potential common mechanism for the multisystem degeneration of the brain that leads to the onset of AD.\nMethods\nHuman brain samples\nPost-mortem human brain and serum samples were obtained in accordance with institutional guidelines and with approval from the Harvard Medical School Institutional Review Board. All procedures complied with relevant ethical regulations. All post-mortem human brain and serum samples were fully deidentified before receipt, and no identifiable private donor information was accessible to the researchers. As such, informed consent was not applicable. Frozen post-mortem samples from the prefrontal cortex (BA9/10/47) were available for all cases included in the analysis. Cerebellar tissue and the most recently collected pre-mortem serum samples were available for a subset of individuals. The primary analysis was performed on tissue samples procured from the Rush Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center, derived from participants in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (referred to as ROSMAP). The ROSMAP is a longitudinal, clinical\u2013pathological study of ageing, cognitive decline and AD58. Study participants agreed to comprehensive annual clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and brain donation at death. To assess cognitive function, 21 cognitive-function tests were used, 19 were in common and 11 were used to inform on clinical diagnoses, as previously described59,60. The follow-up rate exceeded 95% and the autopsy rate exceeded 90%. All individuals who underwent autopsy were subject to a uniform structured neuropathological evaluation of AD. Informed consent, an Anatomic Gift Act and a repository consent were obtained and the studies were approved by an Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. A second set of frozen frontal cortical brain samples was obtained from brain banks at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke University and Washington University, and is referred to as \u201ca second independent cohort\u201d. Brain tissue obtained from these sources had a confirmed pathological diagnosis of AD or NCI. Samples were randomly selected by the source institutions based on tissue availability and alignment with the requested diagnostic categories (NCI, MCI and AD). Within each diagnostic group, samples were matched for age and sex to ensure group comparability.\nAbsolute and relative metal levels were measured by ICP\u2013MS, with relative levels calculated as the ratio of cortical or cerebellar to serum concentrations from the same individual. Post-mortem interval had no significant effect on total or relative Li levels in this cohort. The study population comprised 40.2% male individuals and 59.8% female individuals. Within diagnostic subgroups, NCI cases comprised 40.8% male individuals and 59.2% female individuals; MCI cases, 42% male individuals and 58% female individuals; and AD cases, 36.4% male individuals and 63.6% female individuals. Individuals of both sexes were analysed, and those with MCI and AD, regardless of sex, exhibited significantly reduced cortical-to-serum Li ratios and lower total cortical Li levels. Donor sex was self-reported and provided by Rush Medical Center (ROSMAP study) and by further tissue sources, including Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke University and Washington University.\nIsolation of plaque-enriched and non-plaque fractions\nTo fractionate brain parenchymal homogenates into amyloid plaque-enriched and non-plaque fractions, we modified a previously described protocol61,62. Frozen brain samples were weighed and then Dounce-homogenized (40 strokes per sample) in 5 volumes (v/w) of ultrapure buffer containing 2% SDS (stock of ultrapure SDS 10%, ThermoFisher Scientific, 24730020) and 0.1 M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (VWR, 97064-878) in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6 (ultrapure Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, Invitrogen, 15567-027) and water (Aristar Ultra, VWR 87003-236). The Li concentration of the complete buffer was below the detection threshold (<0.02 \u00b5g l\u22121). The homogenates were heated at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min and then transferred to a 15-ml Falcon tube fitted with a sieve consisting of woven mesh (polyethylene terephthalate) with a pore size of 100 \u00b5m (pluriSelect, SKU 43-10100-60). The samples were passed through the sieve by gravity and the filtrate was then centrifuged (300g for 30 min). The supernatant (soluble non-plaque fraction) was removed and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in water at a ratio of 5 ml per gram of pellet mass and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C (plaque-enriched fraction). To image subfractionated A\u03b2 and phospho-tau (Supplementary Fig. 1), 10 \u03bcl of the freshly collected plaque-enriched and non-plaque fractions was layered onto albumin-coated glass slides and allowed to dry overnight. They were then washed with ultrapure PBS (which we determined contained less than 25 parts per trillion (ppt) Li) and incubated with a rabbit monoclonal anti-A\u03b2 antibody (Cell Signaling, 8243) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to pSer202-tau (clone CP13) overnight in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by labelling with secondary anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 594, or anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:300 in blocking buffer). The slides were then washed three times in ultrapure PBS and mounted.\nICP\u2013MS\nFor the analysis of metals in human and mouse biological samples, we modified previous protocols to optimize the detection of ultra-trace elements. We tested several protocols and found that the use of precleaned polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) vials fitted with perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) caps, the use of ultra-trace grade reagents (nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide and water), combined with an extended sample digestion and homogenization, and a highly sensitive ICP\u2013MS instrument (PerkinElmer NexION 2000C), allowed the robust detection of ultra-trace metals in human and mouse samples. The commercial precleaned PVDF vials (Elemental Scientific, V-14-0712-C) and PFA caps (Elemental Scientific, V-14-0309-C) were further processed by fully immersing them in 10% trace-grade nitric acid (Fisher Chemical, A509-P212) for at least 48 h, followed by abundant rinsing with double-distilled and deionized water and drying in a chemical hood for 48 h. The chemical hood was thoroughly cleaned before the experiment and was used exclusively for ICP\u2013MS for the entire duration of the experiment to prevent contamination. We also used a protocol allowing for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of human brain samples (approximately 80\u2013120 mg frozen brain material per region per case). First, we determined that the dry-to-wet ratio was unchanged in AD versus NCI. This was established in n = 45 NCI and n = 45 AD frozen cortical samples (100\u2013200 mg per sample) that were weighed and then dried to a constant weight (48 h in a dry oven at 60 \u00b0C). The dry-to-wet ratios were 0.127 \u00b1 0.048 for NCI and 0.123 \u00b1 0.034 for AD and were not statistically different (P = 0.67), in agreement with previous work63.\nThe frozen cortical and cerebellum samples were first allowed to thaw, and were then weighed and digested in 5 volumes of nitric acid 67% (w/m, relative to wet mass; BDH Aristar Ultra, VWR, 87003-226) for 72 h with regular vortexing (20 s per vial every 12 h). The samples were fully digested after about 36 h. The serum, the brain non-plaque fractions and the aqueous solutions were digested in an equal volume of nitric acid (67%) for 48 h with regular vortexing (20 s per vial every 12 h). After digestion with nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide (30%; BDH Aristar Ultra, VWR, 87003-224) was added for 24 h with regular vortexing (20 s per vial every 12 h). We added one volume of hydrogen peroxide (w/m, relative to starting wet mass) to digested brain tissues and 0.75 volumes (relative to starting sample volume) to digested serum, non-plaque fractions and aqueous solutions. The samples were then diluted using a 2% nitric solution in ultrapure water (BDH Aristar, VWR, 87003-236). Indium was added to each solution as an internal standard (50 parts per billion; ppb). For all ICP\u2013MS runs, we also measured freshly made solutions of element standards (0, 10 ppt, 50 ppt, 100 ppt, 1 ppb, 10 ppb and 50 ppb) using a 30-element ICP standard (Aristar, VWR, 89800-580). Each run included n = 10 digestion blanks as well as n = 20\u201330 blank measurements to calculate the detection limits. The samples were injected into a PerkinElmer NexION 2000C ICP\u2013MS instrument fitted with a cross-flow nebulizer and peristaltic pump for sample introduction. The sample delay time was 30 s with a pump speed of 24 rpm. A wash solution of 2% nitric was used between analyses of samples. The human cortex, cerebellum and serum samples were each measured twice on two consecutive days (two technical replicates per sample) and the average value was obtained for each sample. The correlation coefficients between the lithium concentrations measured on day 1 and day 2 were r > 0.99 for frontal cortex, cerebellum and serum, showing that the ICP\u2013MS measurement was highly reproducible. After each run, ICP\u2013MS signal processing was done using GeoPro 2010 Software (Cetac Technologies). We derived the standard curves for each element, calculated the concentration of each element in the diluted solution, and used the dilution factors to derive elemental abundance in the original samples. Li levels in the cortex and cerebellum are reported per unit of wet weight (Fig. 1d,e, Extended Data Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were calculated as follows: LOD = YB + 2tSB and LOQ = YB + 10SB, where YB is the average blank signal, t is the critical value of the one-tailed t-test (one-tailed, 95% confidence interval; for example, for 27 blank samples, df = 26 and t = 1.706) and SB is the standard deviation of a blank signal. LOD and LOQ values for all metals can be found in Supplementary Table 1. All individual Li measurements in human samples (prefrontal cortex, cerebellum and serum) were above the LOQ. In recovery experiments, wet brain samples or fluids were spiked with lithium standard added at three levels (n = 7 replicates per spiking level). The recovery of Li from spiked samples ranged from 91% to 105%. All human sample measurements were double-blinded: one lab member not involved in the study relabelled the samples and kept a file with the old and new codes. After the ICP\u2013MS measurements, the samples were unblinded in the presence of the researchers involved in the study, as well as the lab member who was not involved in the study.\nThe ICP\u2013MS findings from post-mortem human samples were replicated as follows. First, reduced Li content in the cortex of patients with AD was observed using two independent methods, after measurement of total Li levels in frozen cortical material of cases from both ROSMAP (Fig. 1d) and other sources (Fig. 1e), as well as after fractionation and removal of amyloid plaques (Fig. 1g). Second, decreased Li levels in the AD versus NCI prefrontal cortex (P = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123) were also independently confirmed when n = 60 NCI and AD cases were processed and analysed by ICP\u2013MS in a different laboratory (the Spectroscopy Core Facility at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln). Third, decreased Li levels in the AD versus NCI prefrontal cortex (P = 3 \u00d7 10\u22123) were also confirmed when n = 48 NCI and AD cases were processed using an alternative protocol. Frozen samples were thawed and dried to a constant weight by incubating in a dry oven at 60 \u00b0C for 48 h. The dried tissue was then digested in 1 ml of 67% nitric acid using a heating block at 95 \u00b0C for 3 h. After digestion, 0.3 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide was added and the mixture was heated for a further 3 h. Finally, the samples were diluted and analysed using ICP\u2013MS.\nLi levels measured in the PFC of ageing NCI cases (ROSMAP cases: mean 2.36 \u00b1 1.23 ng per g, range 0.52\u20136.0 ng per g; non-ROSMAP cases: mean 3.50 \u00b1 2.27 ng per g, range 0.89\u20139.94 ng per g; Fig. 1d,e) were similar to those measured in a previous study64 (4.1 \u00b1 1.7 ng per g in the prefrontal cortex of aged non-diseased cases; age, 71 \u00b1 12 years). Similarly, Li levels measured in the cerebellum (ROSMAP cases: mean 2.90 \u00b1 1.69 ng per g, range 0.58\u20138.40 ng per g; Extended Data Fig. 1b) were similar to those measured in the previous study64 (2.9 \u00b1 1.3 ng per g). Finally, consistent with previous studies, we observed significantly elevated levels of sodium25 and zinc26, along with reduced copper12,65 levels, in the AD cortex (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1).\nLA-ICP\u2013MS\nThe Li composition in the human and mouse brains in situ was analysed using LA-ICP\u2013MS. Frozen human and mouse brains were first embedded in OCT medium and then sectioned using a cryostat, and the resulting sections (80 \u03bcm thick) were mounted onto glass slides. Before data acquisition, the samples were placed vertically in a rack and air-dried for 1 h. The LA-ICP\u2013MS spectrometer consisted of a laser ablation system (213 nm Nd:YAG, Cetac Technologies) connected to a Perkin Elmer NexION 2000C ICP\u2013MS (Perkin Elmer). Using the line tool, we manually selected the area to be ablated. For human samples, we ablated a region of the prefrontal cortex. For mouse samples, we processed coronal sections where the cortex and hippocampus were readily identifiable. The analyte signal was collected using multiple parallel line scans along the entire selected area, progressing in the direction of ablation cell gas flow, using a spot size of 200 \u00b5m at 75 \u00b5m s\u22121. The laser operated at an energy level of 70% and a pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz. The typical run time for one sample was about 4\u20135 h. We also ablated parts of each section that did include brain tissue but contained embedding medium (OCT) and subtracted this background signal from the total signal. Levels of 7Li were normalized to carbon (12C) to correct for any variations in the amount of tissue ablated. Similar conclusions were reached when the analysis did not include normalization to 12C. Matrix-matched standards were obtained by spiking homogenized samples of human or mouse tissue with three different concentrations of metal standard solution containing the analytes of interest. After homogenization, the mixtures were frozen and 80-\u03bcm sections were cut using the cryostat. The final concentrations of these standards were validated by ICP\u2013MS. After LA-ICP\u2013MS data acquisition, signal processing was done using Iolite Software 2018 (Iolite). A Li distribution matrix was generated computationally, using the multiple parallel line rasters. To identify the regions occupied by amyloid plaques, the section immediately adjacent to the section analysed by LA-ICP\u2013MS was processed for A\u03b2 immunofluorescence. In brief, the adjacent section was first fixed with 4% PFA for 2 h then washed three times with PBS. The section was then blocked for 1 h with 2% BSA, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The anti-A\u03b2 primary antibody (Cell Signaling, 8243), diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer, was then added and the section was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The next day, the section was washed three times with PBS (in total, 30 min), and a secondary anti-rabbit Alexa 594 antibody (diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer) was added for 3 h. The section was finally washed three times with PBS (for 30 min) and mounted. We acquired multiple pictures of A\u03b2 immunofluorescence spanning the entire section using an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. The images were then stitched together and imported into Iolite, where the distribution of A\u03b2 immunofluorescence was computationally superimposed on the LA-ICP\u2013MS Li distribution matrix. For each human or mouse sample, we manually selected multiple regions containing A\u03b2 plaques (plaque or \u2018P regions\u2019) as well as neighbouring regions devoid of plaques (non-plaque or \u2018NP regions\u2019).\nThe mean Li levels in P and NP regions were determined, and after correcting for background and normalizing to 12C, the P:NP ratios were calculated. Three other isotopes were also assessed: 57Fe, 63Cu and 66Zn. All measurements in P and NP regions exceeded the LOQ, which was 0.82 ng per g for 7Li, 0.23 \u00b5g per g for 57Fe, 0.44 \u00b5g per g for 63Cu and 55.1 ng per g for 66Zn). As positive controls, 57Fe, 63Cu and 66Zn were all enriched in plaques relative to non-plaque regions in the AD brain, consistent with previous observations66.\nLithium salts\nLiO was obtained from Innophos Nutrition and LiC was from Rockwood Lithium. The purity and Li content were verified by mass spectrometry and ICP\u2013MS, respectively. Sources for other Li salts used in conductivity assays are provided in Supplementary Table 16.\nLi salts were dissolved in distilled, deionized drinking water and administered ad libitum to mice. The low Li dose corresponded to 4.3 \u03bcEq l\u22121 (equivalent to 0.03 mg (30 \u00b5g) of elemental Li per litre). The background Li concentration in the water was minimal (0.109 \u00b5g l\u22121). Solutions of 4.3 \u00b5M LiO and 2.15 \u00b5M LiC were prepared to deliver equivalent amounts of elemental Li, accounting for the two Li atoms per molecule of LiC (Li2CO3). A 4.3 \u00b5M sodium orotate (NaO) solution was also prepared to assess the effects of the orotate anion in the absence of Li. Two more Li doses were also tested: 43 \u00b5Eq l\u22121 (delivered as 43 \u00b5M LiO) and 430 \u00b5Eq l\u22121 (delivered as 430 \u00b5M LiO or 215 \u00b5M Li2CO3). To control for the orotate anion at the high dose, a 430 \u00b5M NaO solution was also tested. Average daily water consumption was comparable across all treatment groups and the vehicle (water-only) group. To evaluate Li uptake and its biological effects in the brain, mice received the Li-containing water for defined periods. Animals were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, with control mice receiving plain drinking water.\nConductivity measurements\nTo measure the conductivity of Li salts, the salts were dissolved in water to achieve Li concentrations of 4.3 mEq l\u22121, 430 \u03bcEq l\u22121, 43 \u03bcEq l\u22121 or 21.5 \u03bcEq l\u22121 in each case. Conductivity was measured using an ST300C conductivity meter (OHAUS, 83033964) equipped with a STCON7 electrode (OHAUS, 30080693) calibrated with potassium chloride conductivity standards. For each lithium salt, three independent solution replicates (n = 3) were prepared. Conductivity values are reported in \u03bcS per cm at 25 \u00b0C.\nIn vitro binding of lithium to A\u03b2\nTo assess the in vitro binding of Li to A\u03b2, both oligomeric and fibrillar forms of A\u03b242 were prepared. Human A\u03b21\u201342 peptide (1 mg) was initially dissolved in 80 \u03bcl of 1% NH4OH then diluted with PBS to a final concentration of 1 mg ml\u22121 (stock solution) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Oligomeric A\u03b242 was generated by resuspending the stock solution in PBS followed by overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C. Fibrillar A\u03b242 was obtained by incubating the same stock at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h. For Li binding assays, 10 \u00b5g of either oligomeric or fibrillar A\u03b242 (10 \u00b5l of the 1 mg ml\u22121 stock) was added to 90 \u00b5l of Li-containing solutions. These solutions included varying concentrations of either LiO or LiC, matched for Li content and dissolved in ultrapure water (BDH Aristar, VWR, 87003-236). Ultrapure water alone served as the negative control. Samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h. After incubation, the mixtures were transferred to dialysis membranes for 24 h to remove unbound Li (Pur-A-Lyzer mini dialysis kits were used: 6\u20138 kDa cut-off for oligomers and 25 kDa for fibrils). After dialysis, the samples were transferred into precleaned PVDF vials and digested by adding an equal volume of 67% nitric acid (final volume, 200 \u00b5l), followed by a 24-h digestion period. The digested samples were then diluted to 800 \u00b5l with 2% nitric acid prepared in ultrapure water. Li content was quantified using a PerkinElmer NexION 2000C ICP\u2013MS instrument. Elemental Li standards were prepared and standard curves showed excellent linearity (r > 0.99). The bound 7Li levels were calculated across a range of Li salt concentrations, and binding curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism (v.9.4.1). Binding affinities (EC50) and 95% confidence intervals for LiO and LiC were determined using nonlinear regression analysis ([agonist] versus response\u2013variable slope, four-parameter model; Supplementary Table 13). Binding to A\u03b242 oligomers and fibrils was modelled across the full concentration range (0\u2013500 \u03bcEq l\u22121) as well as within the higher-affinity subranges (0\u201350 \u03bcEq l\u22121 for oligomers and 0\u201330 \u03bcEq l\u22121 for fibrils; Supplementary Table 13).\nMice\nAnimal housing and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School. All mice were housed socially (2\u20134 animals per cage) in a room with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle (lights on at 06:00), controlled for temperature (18\u201322 \u00b0C) and humidity (40\u201360%). Sentinel mice housed in each rack were tested quarterly and confirmed to be free of pathogens. All cages were individually ventilated. The standard diet 5053, as well as the chemically defined control and Li-deficient diets, were irradiated. Reverse osmosis deionized water and deionized water containing LiO, LiC or NaO was provided ad libitum in bottles that were changed at least weekly.\nWild-type mice were on a C57BL/6J background. We analysed both adult (3\u20136 months old) and aged (up to 26 months old) wild-type mice, treated for varying durations. The 3xTg mice14 carried APPSwe and tauP301L mutant transgenes, as well as a PS1 knock-in mutation, and were in a hybrid C57BL/6J and 129Sv/Ev background. The J20 mice13 transgenic mice expressed a mutant form of the human amyloid protein precursor bearing both the Swedish (K670N/M671L) and the Indiana (V717F) mutations (APPSwInd) in a C57BL/6J background. For breeding, 10\u201320 females (all litter-mates derived from the same cross) were typically mated with 8\u201312 males (all litter-mates derived from the same cross). Mice were identified by numbered ear tags and were randomly selected for behavioural and histological analyses.\nTo assess treatment effects on disease onset and progression, animals were treated either before pathology emerged (5\u20136 months old for 3xTg; 3 months old for J20) or after pathology was established (starting at 9 months old for 3xTg and 17 months old for J20). To investigate age-related effects in wild-type mice, chronic treatments were initiated in adulthood (10\u201312 months old) and continued for 10\u201314 months during ageing. Experiments included both sexes, and results were consistent between males and females. The number and sex of animals used in each experimental group can be found in the Source Data file. Investigators remained blinded to genotypes and treatment conditions throughout data collection and analysis. No prior sample-size calculations were done, but the number of animals used was consistent with similar studies in the field.\nMouse diet\nLi levels in the cortex were comparable between human NCI cases (RUSH cohort: range 0.52\u20136.0 ng per g; non-RUSH cohort: range 0.89\u20139.94 ng per g) and mice (wild type and J20: range 1.61\u20134.59 ng per g). Similarly, serum Li levels in human NCI cases (range 1.53\u201310.41 ng ml\u22121) overlapped with those in mice (wild type, J20, 3xTg: range 0.75\u20134.50 ng ml\u22121), supporting the relevance of mouse models for studying the biological effects of lithium.\nThe regular mouse 5053 is a grain-based diet that does not allow Li levels to be manipulated experimentally. To obtain a Li-deficient diet, we used a standard, chemically defined mouse AIN-93M diet that is calorically and nutritionally equivalent to the 5053 diet and was formulated as a standard diet for laboratory rodents by the American Institute of Nutrition in 1993. We tested 5 samples of the regular mouse 5053 diet and 5 samples of the AIN-93M diet and found that the average Li content was 104.8 ng per g in the 5053 diet and 103 ng per g in the AIN-93M diet. The AIN-93M chemically defined diet was modified to exclude Li. The Li-deficient and control AIN-93M diets were formulated by Dyets. We measured Li levels in the Li-deficient diet and confirmed that Li was depleted by 92.0% relative to the chemically defined control diet. The abundances of the other 26 metals that we measured by ICP\u2013MS were identical (data not shown). The solid diets were irradiated before administration to animals. The diets were stored in closed plastic bags that were placed inside cardboard boxes (devoid of light) at \u221220 \u00b0C for up to 4 months before administration to animals.\nDNA extraction and genotyping by PCR\nWe collected about 0.5\u20131.0 cm of mouse tails in clean Eppendorf tubes; 500 \u03bcl of tail lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) containing 0.4 mg ml\u22121 Proteinase K was added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated overnight in a 56 \u00b0C water bath. The next day, 500 \u03bcl of isopropanol was added to precipitate the DNA, and the tubes were shaken vigorously for 20 s. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000g and the isopropanol was carefully removed, avoiding the DNA pellet. We then added 70% ethanol and shook the tubes to wash the DNA pellet. We next centrifuged the tubes for 10 min at 18,000g. We removed the ethanol and air-dried the DNA pellet for 2\u201316 h. The DNA was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl acetate-EDTA buffer and placed in a 56 \u00b0C water bath overnight. To amplify DNA regions by PCR, we mixed 3 \u03bcl of DNA sample with corresponding amounts of forward and reverse PCR primers, PCR master mix and nuclease-free water, and ran the reactions in a thermocycler. Sample loading dye was added to the PCR products and the samples were run on 1\u20133% agarose gels (prepared by dissolving agarose in TAE buffer, to which Gel Red was added to allow DNA visualization). We also loaded a 100-bp DNA ladder. Gels were visualized using a UV transilluminator.\nQuantitative RT\u2013PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from cells and tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase treatment to remove genomic DNA contamination. Primers were obtained from Harvard\u2019s PrimerBank: for mouse Gsk3b, forward 5\u2032-TGGCAGCAAGGTAACCACAG-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-CGGTTCTTAAATCGCTTGTCCTG-3\u2032; for mouse Gapdh, forward 5\u2032-CTTTGTCAAGCTCATTTCCTGG-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-TCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGC-3\u2032. Real-time PCR was performed for 40 cycles. The specificity and purity of PCR and RT\u2013PCR products were confirmed by the presence of single-peak melting curves.\nGSK3\u03b2 inhibitor treatment\nLi-deficient and control 3xTg mice 12 months old, maintained on their respective diets for three months, were treated with the GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor CHIR-99021 or a vehicle control. A stock solution of CHIR-99021 was prepared in DMSO and diluted in 0.9% saline to a final concentration of 10 mg ml\u22121, containing 2% DMSO. The solution was warmed to 70 \u00b0C to ensure dissolution of the compound. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of CHIR99021 at a dose of 50 mg per kg body weight, once daily for 14 consecutive days. Control animals received equivalent volumes of vehicle (2% DMSO in saline). All animals tolerated the treatment without visible abnormalities and were included in the analysis.\nBlood chemistry\nBUN and creatinine measurements were done by IDEXX Laboratories, using mouse serum samples. TSH levels in the mouse serum were assessed by ELISA (Elabscience, E-EL-M1153).\nBehavioural testing\nOpen field\nMice were placed in an open field box (75 cm \u00d7 75 cm) and movements were tracked in real-time using TopScan Lite software (CleverSys) coupled to a camera. Each mouse was recorded for 10 min, and the average speed and distance travelled were automatically recorded. Mice had no prior exposure to the open-field arena (spontaneous test). All behavioural experiments were performed by researchers who were blinded to the experimental conditions.\nMorris water maze\nTo assess spatial learning and memory, we trained and tested mice in a large circular pool (1.1 m in diameter) filled with 21 \u00b0C water, which was rendered opaque by the addition of non-toxic white paint. We placed four distinct visual cues (representing different geometric shapes, patterns and colours) on each wall, to facilitate spatial orientation and the acquisition of spatial memory. Mice were given four training trials a day for 5\u20137 consecutive days. Each training trial lasted for 1 min. Mice were trained to remember the location of a hidden platform that was submerged 2.5 cm below the water surface. The location of the hidden platform (south-east) remained the same during the 5\u20137-day training period. If, after a 60-second trial, the animal failed to locate the platform, it was placed on the platform and allowed to remain on the platform for 15 s. Mice were trained four times a day and entered the pool in a randomized order of rotating entrance points (compass directions N, S, E, W, NE and SW). During each training trial, the latency to find the hidden platform was recorded. Then, 24 h after the last training trial, a probe trial was conducted. The platform was removed and mice entered the arena from the NW location (opposite from the platform). The number of entries in the target area (representing the area where the platform had been located during the training trials), the total time spent in the target area, as well as the time spent in all quadrants, and the swimming speed were recorded during the 60-s probe trial. We also conducted separate trials in which a visible platform (platform elevated above the water level, on which a small red flag had been placed) was presented. Mice were given several training sessions and the time (latency) to reach the visible platform was recorded. Mouse movements, as well as average speed, distance travelled, latency to reach a quadrant or target area and number of entries in the target area, were tracked in real time using TopScan Lite software (Clever Sys) and the different measures were automatically recorded. For measurements of learning (latency to reach the platform during the training trials), mice underwent repeated measurements (four measurements a day for 6\u20137 consecutive days).\nNovel-object recognition\nMice were placed in the same open-field box with two novel identical objects for 10 min and allowed to freely explore the identical objects. The next day, mice were reintroduced in the open-field box and presented with a novel object, as well as one of the two objects they explored the previous day. The mice were allowed to explore the objects for 10 min and their movements were tracked in real time using TopScan Lite software (Clever Sys) coupled to a camera. The box and items were cleaned with 70% ethanol between mice. We automatically recorded the time each mouse spent exploring each object, on both day 1 (two identical objects) or day 2 (one novel object and one familiar object), and derived a novelty (discrimination) index, defined as the ratio of time spent exploring the novel object relative to the familiar one.\nY maze\nSpontaneous alternation, which is a measure of spatial working memory, was assessed by allowing the mice to freely explore a Y-shaped maze for 8 min. The Y maze consisted of 3 arms (each 40 cm \u00d7 8 cm x 15 cm) at an angle of 120\u00b0 from each other. Mice typically preferred to investigate a new arm of the maze, rather than returning to one that was previously visited. Using TopScanLite software, we recorded each entry in one of the three arms (A, B and C) and then derived the percentage of total correct alternations over the 8-min duration of the trial. A correct alternation (triad) is a succession of entries into three different arms (A\u2013B\u2013C, A\u2013C\u2013B, B\u2013A\u2013C, B\u2013C\u2013A, C\u2013A\u2013B or C\u2013B\u2013A).\nMouse neuropathology\nMice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and carbon dioxide and then perfused with PBS at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. Brains were rapidly removed and the two hemispheres were separated. One hemisphere was dissected into subregions (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum). Each subregion was placed in a separate Eppendorf tube, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored in a freezer at \u221280 \u00b0C. The second hemisphere was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h. The fixed brain was then processed for paraffin embedding, using standard procedures. Paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned and 6-\u03bcm sections were mounted on glass slides and used for histological analyses.\nParaffin-embedded mouse brain blocks were sectioned and the sections were mounted on glass slides. We deparaffinized the sections by immersion in two xylene baths for a total of 10 min, followed by a 5-min immersion in a 50% xylene:50% ethanol solution. The sections were then rehydrated by immersion in solutions of decreasing concentrations of ethanol (95%, 90%, 70% and 50%) and then placed in water. Sections then underwent antigen retrieval using the Diva decloaker (BioCare). Sections were blocked with 3% BSA, 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 16 has a list of antibodies used for immunolabelling) were diluted in 3% BSA, 3% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, sections were washed three times with PBS. Secondary antibodies, diluted in 3% BSA, 3% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS were either biotin-coupled (1:200; Vector Labs) or coupled to Alexa fluorophores (1:300, Invitrogen). After three 10-min washes with PBS, sections were mounted with Pro-Long anti-fade mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen) and then imaged using confocal microscopy. For the A\u03b2 labelling shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e, we incubated sections with an anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG secondary antibody (VectorLabs) for 1 h, followed by three washes in PBS (1 min each) and the addition of avidin-streptavidin-HRP-coupled complex (1:200 in 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS; VectorLabs). After three washes with PBS, we added diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (prepared by dissolving DAB and peroxide tablets in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for several minutes, until a brown precipitate formed. Sections were then washed with PBS, dehydrated with increasing ethanol concentrations (50%, 70%, 90%, 95% and 100%), followed by incubation with a 50% ethanol:50% xylene solution and two immersions in 100% xylene (5 min each). Sections were mounted with a hydrophobic mounting medium (Permount). For Thioflavin S staining, after deparaffinization the brains were incubated with filtered 1% aqueous Thioflavin-S for 8 min at room temperature, then washed twice (3 min each) in 80% ethanol, once in 95% ethanol (3 min), three times in distilled water and finally mounted. For sections labelled by immunofluorescence, multiple confocal images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview Confocal Microscope FV3000. For DAB-stained sections, we acquired pictures using a bright-field microscope coupled with a camera.\nFor analysis of the A\u03b2 plaque burden, pictures of A\u03b2 immunoreactivity (using the rabbit anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, clone D54D2, Cell Signaling, 8243, dilution 1:250) in the hippocampus were processed using a macro developed for use with Fiji/ImageJ 2.9.0. In brief, confocal pictures were all saved in the same folder and were all automatically opened in Fiji and processed serially. For each picture, the background was subtracted (rolling ball radius was set for 25). Pictures then underwent de-noising, using a Gaussian blur filter (radius of one pixel). The images were then thresholded using the Default Fiji threshold set at 120. Particles with a minimal size of 5 \u03bcm2 were retained and their number, average size and mean fluorescence intensity were automatically recorded for each picture in an Excel file. To calculate the A\u03b2 plaque burden, the total area occupied by A\u03b2 plaques was divided by the area of the selection. Three coronal sections (6 \u03bcm thick) were sampled for each animal, in the rostral, intermediate and ventral hippocampus. Two 20\u00d7 images were acquired per section, using an Olympus FluoView LV1000 confocal microscope. The average A\u03b2 burden was obtained by averaging the A\u03b2 plaque density (area occupied by A\u03b2 plaques divided by the total area analysed) in all pictures acquired for each animal.\nFor analysis of tau pathology, pictures of p-Ser202 tau (CP13, dilution 1:150) or p-Ser396/Ser404 tau (PHF1, dilution 1:200) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus CA1 were processed using a macro developed for use with Fiji/ImageJ 2.9.0. In brief, confocal pictures were all saved in the same folder and were all automatically opened in Fiji and processed serially. Pictures underwent de-noising, using a Gaussian blur filter (radius of one pixel). The images were then thresholded using the Default Fiji threshold set at 150. The number of tau-positive neurons in the selected CA1 area was then manually counted for each thresholded picture and the area was measured. For each picture, we calculated the average density of tau-positive neurons (the total number of tau-positive neurons divided by the area of the region). The average tau-positive neuron densities were calculated for each animal by averaging all the pictures acquired.\nFluorescent image analysis was also performed using MetaMorph NX 2.5 (Meta Series, Molecular Devices). Mean fluorescence intensity for specific markers was quantified in each animal either in the nucleus (\u03b2-catenin) or across the entire cell body (for example, GSK3\u03b2, pSer9-GSK3\u03b2, pTyr216-GSK3\u03b2, GPNMB and LPL), based on co-labelling with cell-type-specific markers (such as MAP2, aspartoacylase and Iba1). Between 50 and 300 cells per mouse were analysed, and background signal was subtracted. Synaptophysin and PSD-95 fluorescence intensities were quantified in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and FluoroMyelin, MBP and SMI-312 intensities were measured in the corpus callosum, with background subtraction applied in all cases. Cell densities of Iba1+, CD68+, aspartoacylase+, PDGFR\u03b1+ and GFAP+ populations were also determined in relevant brain regions by quantifying 50\u2013500 cells per mouse. For each measurement, multiple images were acquired at 4\u00d7, 10\u00d7, 20\u00d7 or 40\u00d7 magnification per animal, spanning the region of interest. Values were averaged for each animal before statistical analysis. The following primary antibodies were also used: anti-aspartoacylase [N1C3-2] (GeneTex, GTX113389; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-aspartoacylase (clone D-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-377308, mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:50), anti-\u03b2-catenin (clone E247; Abcam, ab32572; rabbit recombinant monoclonal, dilution 1:250), anti-\u03b2-catenin (clone 1B8A1; PTGlab, 66379-1-Ig, mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-CD68 (clone KP1; Abcam, ab955; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GFAP (Sigma-Aldrich, G9269; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GSK3\u03b2 (clone 3D10; Novus Bio, NBP1-47470SS; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-pTyr216-GSK3\u03b2 (Millipore Sigma, SAB4300237; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:100), anti-pSer9-GSK3\u03b2 (Abcam, ab131097; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:100), anti-Iba1 (clone EPR16588; Abcam ab178846; rabbit recombinant monoclonal, dilution 1:2,000), anti-PSD-95 (clone K28/43; Biolegend, 810401; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:250), anti-synaptophysin (clone SY38; Millipore Sigma, mouse monoclonal, MAB5258-I; dilution 1:200), anti-neurofilament marker (pan axonal marker; clone SMI-312; Biolegend, 837904; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GPNMB (clone 2B10B8; PTGlab, 66926-1-Ig; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-LPL (Novus Bio, AF7197-SP; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-MAP2 (Phosphosolutions, 1099-MAP2; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:500), anti-MBP (clone D8X4Q; Cell Signaling, 78896; rabbit monoclonal, dilution 1:200) and anti-PDGFR\u03b1 (R&D Systems, AF1062; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:200). Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:300 dilution: donkey anti-goat Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, A-11058), donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed antibody, Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A21206), donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed antibody, Alexa 594 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A21203), donkey anti-mouse Alexa 647 (Invitrogen, A-31571), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen, A-31573) and donkey anti-goat Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, A-11055).\nGolgi labelling\nThe brains were processed and stained using the FD Rapid Golgistain Kit (FD Neurotechnologies, PK401) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with minor modifications. Immediately after dissection, the brains were fixed overnight in 4% PFA. After cryosectioning, free-floating sections of 100 \u03bcm were shortly (10 min) fixed in 4% PFA, then stained using the kit\u2019s reagents and mounted using a glycerin-containing medium. Then 12 dendrites per mouse were imaged in the hippocampus or the cortex using a confocal microscope. Dendritic spine density was quantified using Fiji software v.2.9.0.\nTransmission electron microscopy\nThe 3xTg mice were fed either a Li-deficient diet (n = 8) or a control diet (n = 8) from 6 to 12 months of age. At the end point, mice were perfused with a fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15949). After perfusion, 1\u20132-mm3 brain sections were generated and post-fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in fresh fixative. The corpus callosum was subsequently dissected and processed for embedding in TAAB Epon resin at the Harvard Electron Microscopy Core Facility. In brief, tissue was washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h, rinsed in distilled water and incubated in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h. After two further water rinses, samples were dehydrated through graded ethanol (50%, 70%, 90% and twice in 100%, for 10 min each) followed by 1 h in propylene oxide. Samples were then infiltrated overnight in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and TAAB Epon (Marivac), embedded in pure TAAB Epon the next day and polymerized at 60 \u00b0C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (approximately 80 nm thick) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut-S microtome, mounted on copper grids, stained with lead citrate and imaged using either a JEOL 1200EX or a Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN transmission electron microscope. Images were captured using an AMT 2k CCD camera and saved in TIFF format. Quantification of myelin sheath thickness, axon diameter and g-ratio was performed using MetaMorph NX 2.5 software (Meta Series, Molecular Devices). A total of 1,376 axons (control group) and 1,396 axons (Li-deficient group) were analysed from eight randomly selected fields per animal (\u00d74,800 magnification) spanning the corpus callosum.\nA\u03b2 detection by ELISA\nMouse endogenous A\u03b2x\u201340 and A\u03b2x\u201342 levels were measured using a previously established protocol67. In brief, hippocampi or cortices were homogenized in 20 volumes (v/w) of tissue lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and 250 mM sucrose, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) and 100 \u03bcM AEBSF. Soluble A\u03b2 species were extracted from tissue homogenates by diethanolamine treatment. Mouse A\u03b2(x\u201340) and A\u03b2x\u201342 were quantified using Wako ELISA kits (292-64501 and 294-62501, respectively). The LOQs were 7.44 pmol l\u22121 for A\u03b2(x\u201340) and 4.75 pmol l\u22121 for A\u03b2x\u201342. Sample concentrations ranged from 26.21 to 52.98 pmol l\u22121 for A\u03b2(x\u201340) and from 11.72 to 22.40 pmol l\u22121 for A\u03b2x\u201342, all above the respective LOQs.\nAssessment of microglial function in vitro\nMicroglial purification for cell-culture assays\nWild-type Li-deficient and control mice were transcardially perfused with 1\u00d7 cold PBS. The cortex and hippocampus were dissected and minced using a scalpel before transferring them to 5 ml digestion buffer (2 U ml\u22121 of Dispase II, 20 U ml\u22121 DNase I, 10 \u03bcM HEPES in HBSS without calcium or magnesium). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C on an orbital shaker. The tissue was then homogenized by successive trituration with a Pasteur pipette followed by a 1 ml pipette. An equal volume of 1\u00d7 HBSS was added to the homogenate and the resulting mix was passed through a 70-\u00b5m cell strainer, then centrifuged at 300g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Samples were resuspended with 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare, 17-0891-02) to remove myelin, and microglia were enriched using CD11b beads, as described above. Microglia were resuspended in pre-warmed media (DMEM/F12 with 2% FBS, 100 ng ml\u22121 IL-34, 50 ng ml\u22121 TGF\u03b21, 25 ng ml\u22121 M-CSF) and counted using a haemocytometer. Microglia were seeded into 96-well glass-bottom plates precoated with poly-l-ornithine (Sigma, P4957) at 5,000 cells per well using 100 \u03bcl of medium. A half-medium change was performed on day 2 and the downstream assay was done on day 3.\nPrimary microglia were also purified using an alternative protocol. After perfusion, the cortex and hippocampus were dissected, placed in 3 ml buffer (0.9% Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and minced with small scissors for 4 min. Then, 7 ml Dispase buffer (2 U ml\u22121 Dispase II in 0.9% Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) was added and the tissue was incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C on an orbital shaker. The tissue was then homogenized by gently triturating with a 10 ml pipette with a wide bore, to prevent cell shearing. The enzyme activity was halted by the 1:1 addition of 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (10 ml) at 4 \u00b0C. The homogenate was passed through a 70-\u00b5m cell strainer to remove meninges and clumped cells. The homogenate was then spun for 10 min at 1,000g and 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of 75% isotonic percoll in PBS (high percoll; GE Healthcare, 17-0891-02). Then 5 ml of 35% isotonic percoll in PBS (low percoll) was added, followed by 4 ml of PBS. The resulting discontinuous gradient was allowed to settle for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. We then centrifuged the tubes at 800g for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C. We then aspirated the top (PBS-containing) layer and part of the upper percoll layer. The band containing microglia (approximately 1.5 ml), situated at the interface between the 35% percoll and 75% percoll layers, was gently collected. Then 50 ml of PBS was gently added and the tube was inverted 20 times. The microglia were then centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in a pre-warmed (at 37 \u00b0C) buffer containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 50 U ml\u22121 penicillin and 50 \u00b5g ml\u22121 streptomycin in RPMI medium.\nThe BV2 microglial cell line has been maintained in the Yankner laboratory for more than 20 years and stored long-term in liquid nitrogen at \u2013180 \u00b0C. After revival, the BV2 cells were authenticated based on their characteristic microglial morphology (small, round to slightly elongated shape, clear cytoplasm and occasional short processes) as well as positive immunolabelling for the microglial markers CD11b and Iba1. Mycoplasma contamination testing was not done.\nMicroglial A\u03b2 uptake and degradation assays\nMicroglial A\u03b2 uptake and degradation assays were done as previously described68. Human amyloid A\u03b21\u201342 was purchased from Anaspec (AS-20276). Next, 1 mg of A\u03b21\u201342 peptide was dissolved in 80 \u03bcl 1% NH4OH, followed by dilution with PBS to 1 mg ml\u22121 (stock) and storage at \u221280 \u00b0C. Oligomeric A\u03b21\u201342 was prepared by resuspending the stock solution in DMEM/F12 to 500 \u03bcg ml\u22121 (100 \u03bcM) and overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C. On day 3, the medium was replaced with DMEM/F12 containing 2% FBS and A\u03b242 oligomers diluted to a final concentration of 2 \u03bcg ml\u22121 (0.4 \u00b5M). To assess A\u03b242 uptake, cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C, followed by three washes with 1\u00d7 PBS and fixation with 4% PFA for 15 min. To assess microglial A\u03b242 degradation, cells incubated with A\u03b242 oligomers for 3 h were first washed three times with warm medium. The cells were then incubated with warm medium devoid of A\u03b242 for an extra 3 h. They were then washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 2% BSA, 2% FBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. Anti-Iba1 and anti-A\u03b2 (6E10) antibodies, diluted 1:500 in the blocking buffer, were then added and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The next day, the cells were washed three times with PBS 1\u00d7 and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:300 in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS, then mounted and analysed by confocal microscopy. We also assessed A\u03b242 uptake and clearance by microglia using fluorescently labelled (HiLyte Fluor 555) human A\u03b21\u201342 (AnaSpec, AS-60480). The fluorescently labelled A\u03b242 was directly added to the medium containing 2% FBS to reach a concentration of 2 ng \u00b5l\u22121, and the uptake and degradation assays were conducted as detailed above.\nMicroglial stimulation and treatment with GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors\nTo assess cytokine release, primary microglia isolated from control and Li-deficient mice were treated with 50 ng ml\u22121 LPS on day 2 for 16 h followed by supernatant collection. Inflammatory cytokines were detected and measured using a mouse cytokine array kit (R&D Systems, ARY006). To assess the effects of GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors on microglial function, microglia were pretreated with 3 \u03bcM CHIR99021 or 1 \u03bcM of PF-04802367 on day 2 for 24 h before A\u03b242 uptake and clearance or cytokine-detection assays.\nsnRNA-seq\nSample preparation\nWe performed snRNA-seq on the hippocampus of 12-month-old 3xTg mice that were fed a Li-deficient (n = 5 mice) or chemically defined control (n = 4 mice) diet for five weeks. Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS at a speed of 6 ml min\u22121 for 8 min to repress the transcriptional response during the brain dissection and sample preparation69,70. Hippocampal tissue was dissected on ice and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Both frozen hippocampal tissues were subsequently thawed together in 500 \u00b5l HB buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT, 0.15 mM spermine and 0.5 mM spermidine) and homogenized with the tight pestle of a dounce homogenizer in the same HB buffer with the addition of 0.32% of IGEPAL (Sigma) (average of 25\u201330 times per sample) on ice. Subsequently, single nuclei were diluted to 9 ml in HB buffer, passed through a 40-\u03bcm filter and separated from debris and multinuclei by iodixanol gradient centrifugation. Specifically, we prepared a 50% iodixanol solution by diluting 60% iodixanol (Optiprep density gradient medium, Sigma D1556) with diluent (150 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl2, 120 mM Tricine-KOH, pH7.8), and subsequently diluted them with HB buffer and supplemented with 0.04% BSA and 64 U ml\u22121 RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega, N2611) to prepare 40% iodixanol and 30% iodixanol. We layered 1 ml of 40% iodixanol in the bottom, 1 ml of 30% iodixanol in the middle and gently layered 9 ml of the diluted nuclei suspension on top of the 30% iodixanol layer. The three layers were visually confirmed to be distinct and were subjected to 18 min of 10,000g centrifugation. Single nuclei were carefully recovered from the 30% iodixanol layer in between the 30% and 40% interface. An aliquot was taken for trypan blue staining and visual inspection of nucleic morphology under a microscope, which showed a homogeneous size distribution and absence of major debris or doublets. The numbers of nuclei were determined initially by haemocytometer and subsequently confirmed with an automated counter. The remainder of the nucleic suspension was diluted for nuclei encapsulation and sequencing library preparation at the Harvard Single Cell Core, according to the 10X Genomics manual. The size and quality of the prepared libraries were confirmed on Agilent high-sensitivity TapeStation and the library was independently quantified by qPCR. The prepared libraries were sequenced by Nova-Seq S4 at the Harvard Biopolymers Facility, at an average coverage of 32,897 reads per nucleus (Supplementary Table 3). Sequencing data and individual animal metadata have been deposited at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus GSE272344 and linked to BioProject PRJNA1136488.\nSingle-nucleus RNA-seq quality control\nWe aligned the demultiplexed raw sequencing reads to the mouse genome (mm10 from 10X Genomics) using Cell Ranger (v.6.1.2)71, with the \u2013include-introns option, to account for nuclear pre-mRNAs. The generated counts table was loaded to Seurat (v.4)72 to generate Seurat objects. Cells with more than 10% of reads being attributed to mitochondrial transcripts were filtered out. Cells that expressed fewer than 200 features (low-quality cells) or more than 8,000 features (apparent doublets) were also filtered out. These thresholds were determined by visual inspection of the distribution of features among cells (Seurat, VlnPlot) and are generally consistent with previous reports57,73. The cells that passed quality controls were log-normalized using the NormalizeData function from Seurat with a scale factor of 10,000. Variable features were identified using the FindVariableFeatures function from Seurat with the vst selection method and 2,000 features. Data were scaled using ScaleData and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using RunPCA with the identified variable features using Seurat. Nearest neighbours were found using FindNeighbors with dimension 1:30, which was determined by ElbowPlot following the Seurat manual. The number of clusters was determined by the FindClusters function using Seurat v.4. UMAP and TSNE were performed using RunUMAP and RunTSNE using Seurat with dimensions 1:30 and do.fast=TRUE parameter. Potential doublets were removed using DoubletFinder (v.3)74 following the default parameters. After filtration, cluster-specific markers were determined using the FindAllMarkers function (Seurat v.4), with parameters only.pos = F, min.pct = 0.25 and max.cell.per.ident = 500.\nCell-type-specific annotation and differential gene expression analyses\nCell types were identified by cross-referencing the transcriptome of each individual cell to the Mouse Cell Atlas75 and independently validated by confirming the expression of established cell-type-specific markers on a cluster-to-cluster basis. Violin and heat scatter plots to demonstrate the expression distribution of selected established markers were plotted using the VlnPlot and FeaturePlot functions of Seurat. Examples of cell-type markers include Slc17a7 (excitatory neurons), Prox1 (granule cells), Gad1 and Gad2 (inhibitory neurons), Mbp (oligodendrocytes), Aldoc, Aqp4 (astrocytes), Pdgfra (OPCs), Vtn (pericytes), Cx3cr1 and Tgfbr1 (microglia), Cldn5 and Flt1 (endothelial cells), Prlr and Folr1 (choroid plexus cells; Supplementary Fig. 4). Cell type-specific abundance and differential gene expression analyses were performed on the main cell types (excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, granule cells, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, OPCs and endothelial cells). Clusters of the same cell types were combined to increase the statistical power, as described previously69,70,76, and clusters with mixed cell types (less than 80% homogenous) were removed for cell-type-specific analyses. The relative abundance of each cell type was computed by dividing the number of cells of the particular cell type by the total number of cells. Two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-tests were done to determine whether there were significant differences in the relative abundance of each cell type between the control and Li-deficient conditions. DEGs were computed by the MAST77 test in Seurat. Genes expressed in fewer than 1% of the cells in each cell type were filtered out. All the DEGs (FDR < 0.05) are reported in Supplementary Table 4. DEGs with FDR < 0.05 and |log2fold change| > 0.1 were used for Gene Ontology enrichment analyses using Metascape78 v.3.5.20240101. The heat scatter plot for DEGs (Fig. 3d) was generated using the FeaturePlot function of Seurat.\nPurified microglia RNA-seq\nPurification of microglia\nLi-deficient or control wild-type and 3xTg mice were perfused transcardially using PBS at 4 \u00b0C. The cortex and hippocampus were quickly dissected and pooled, then minced using a scalpel, before transferring to 5 ml dissection buffer (HBSS without calcium and magnesium) and Protector RNase inhibitor (Sigma) at 4 \u00b0C in a dounce homogenizer. Brain samples were dounced 20 times with a loose pestle and 10 times with a tight pestle. The cell suspension was passed through a pre-wetted 70-\u03bcm cell strainer into a pre-chilled 15 ml tube. Cells were then spun down at 300g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml ice-cold 40% Percoll and centrifuged at 800g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. Myelin debris was removed by vacuum suction and the cell pellet was washed with 5 ml ice-cold HBSS and spun again for 5 min at 300g at 4 \u00b0C. The pellets were resuspended in 180 \u03bcl ice-cold MACs buffer (0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA, Protector RNase inhibitor in PBS) with 20 \u03bcl of CD11b microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-049-601) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After incubation, 1 ml of MACs buffer was added to samples and cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 300g and 4 \u00b0C. Microglia were then isolated using LS columns with QuadroMACS Separator following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, LS columns were pre-washed three times with 3 ml MACs buffer. Samples were resuspended in 500 \u00b5l MACs buffer and transferred to LS columns, followed by three more washes with 3 ml MACs buffer. Finally, microglia were released with 5 ml MACs buffer (without EDTA), then used for RNA extraction.\nMicroglial RNA sequencing quality control and analysis\nTotal microglial RNA was extracted from MACs-purified microglia using RNAzol RT (Sigma, R4533). RNA extracted from each microglial preparation was quantified using an Agilent Tapestation 4200 instrument, with a corresponding Agilent Tapestation High Sensitivity RNA assay (5067-5579). The samples were normalized to 4 ng of input in 9.5 \u03bcl, and the polyadenylated mRNA was selected for using 3\u2032 SMART-Seq CDS Primer II A as part of the Takara SMART-Seq v.4 Ultra Low Input RNA (634894) workflow, which generated cDNA. From there, an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay (5067-4626) was used to quantify the cDNA concentration. Libraries were obtained using the Illumina NexteraXT kit (FC-131-1096). Adapter ligation, indexing and amplification were done subsequently as part of the same workflow. After amplification, residual primers were eluted away using KAPA Pure Beads (07983298001) in a 0.6\u00d7 SPRI-based clean-up. The resulting purified libraries were run on an Agilent 4200 Tapestation instrument, with a corresponding Agilent D5000 ScreenTape assay (5067-5588 and 5067-5589) to visualize the libraries and check the size and concentration of each library. Molarity values obtained from this assay were used to normalize all samples in equimolar ratio for one final pool. The pooled library was denatured and loaded onto a single lane of an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell to generate 100-bp paired-end reads. The pool was loaded at 200 pM (normalized to 1 nM pre-denaturation), with 1% PhiX spiked in as a sequencing control. The base-call files were demultiplexed through the Harvard BPF Genomics Core pipeline and the resulting fastq files were used in subsequent analysis. Raw RNA-sequencing data in FASTQ format were subjected to quality assessment using FastQC (v.0.11.9) and sequencing reads were aligned to mouse genome (mm10) using a STAR aligner79 with the following options: --outFilterMismatchNmax 999 --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04 --alignSJDBoverhangMin 1 --alignSJoverhangMin 8 --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --outFilterType BySJout --alignIntronMin 20 --alignIntronMax 1000000 --alignMatesGapMax 1000000. Microglia RNA-seq yielded an average of 100 million uniquely mapped reads for each sample, and gene expression levels were quantified using htseq-count80. To reduce the computational burden and focus on biologically relevant genes, we initially prefiltered the count data. Genes were retained if they had at least five counts in at least three samples. To validate the purity of the isolated microglia, we determined that microglial markers (Csf1r, P2ry12 and Tmem119) were strongly enriched, whereas neuronal (Map2 and Nsg2), astrocytic (Gfap and Aldh1l1) and oligodendrocyte (Olig2 and Mog) marker genes were negligibly expressed (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). We also verified that markers of ex vivo microglia activation81 (Fos, Jun, Hspa1a and Zfp36) were minimally expressed in our samples (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). Differential gene expression analysis was done using DESeq2 (ref. 82) to identify DEGs between Li-deficient and control microglia, with an adjusted P value cut-off of 0.05 (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). Upregulated and downregulated DEGs from Li-deficient wild-type and 3xTg microglia were further analysed for overlapping DEGs, and the overlapping DEGs were subjected to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using Metascape78 v.3.5.20240101. Results are summarized in Fig. 4a and provided in Supplementary Table 12.\nIngenuity Pathway Analysis\nSignalling pathway and molecular network analyses were done on DEGs identified from the snRNA-seq and microglia RNA-seq datasets (FDR < 0.05) using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)83. Significantly enriched pathways and disease or function annotations were identified and ranked based on the FDR, calculated using a one-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test followed by a Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. To visualize the results, the top pathway-enriched DEGs were integrated into a signalling network using IPA\u2019s build and overlay function (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c).\nRNA-seq of hippocampus from 3xTg mice treated with LiO\nRNA extraction\nTwelve-month-old 3xTg mice that were treated with 4.3 \u00b5M LiO (n = 9 females) or vehicle (water; n = 9 females) from 6 to 12 months of age were transcardially perfused with cold PBS 1\u00d7 and the hippocampi were rapidly dissected and snap frozen. The total hippocampal RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Ambion, 15596018) and purified using a Direct-zol RNA Mini Prep kit (Zymo Research, R2050) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA integrity and concentration were assayed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument. All RNA samples had an RNA integrity number of more than 8.2.\nRNA library preparation and sequencing\nLibraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample-preparation kits from 500 ng of purified total RNA according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The finished dsDNA libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer, Agilent TapeStation 2200, and RT\u2013qPCR using a Kapa Biosystems library quantification kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Uniquely indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument with paired-end 75-bp reads by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facilities. Samples were pooled with multiple samples per lane and sequenced. There were two sequencing batches (batch 1, n = 5 mice per group; batch 2, n = 4 mice per group).\nRNA sequencing quality control and quantification of gene expression\nQuality control of sequencing reads (Supplementary Table 14) was done using FastQC v.0.11.5 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads were aligned to the Mouse GRCm38 genome with GENCODE M21 gene models using STAR79 v.2.7.0f with options --outSAMunmapped Within --alignSJDBoverhangMin 1 --alignSJoverhangMin 8 --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --outFilterType BySJout --alignIntronMin 20 --alignIntronMax 5000000 --alignMatesGapMax 5000000 --twopassMode Basic. The expression of genes was quantified as gene counts using STAR at the same time as alignment with option --quantMode GeneCounts.\nGene-expression normalization and covariate adjustment\nGene counts were input to edgeR. Genes were deemed expressed if at least n = 9 samples (where n is the group size) had more than one count per million (CPM). Genes not satisfying these criteria were removed, keeping the original library sizes. This filtering retained n = 14,862 expressed genes out of 55,536 annotated genes for subsequent analyses. Counts were then normalized using the TMM method in edgeR. Finally, log(CPM) values were calculated for analyses other than differential expression.\nTo adjust gene expression for covariates, we fit the linear regression model for each gene and cohort separately using lm() in R: gene expression ~ group + covariates, where gene expression is log(CPM), and using the group and covariates: factor, two levels: LiO and water (reference level), covariates (sequencing batch (factor, two levels)) and one RUV with residuals (RUVr) covariate (continuous). The final normalized and adjusted gene-expression values were derived from adding the regression residuals to the estimated effect of the group level to preserve the effect of the group on expression. These normalized and adjusted gene-expression values were used to perform gene\u2013gene regression analysis and gene\u2013gene group regression analysis, and to visualize gene expression.\nTo adjust for technical variation, we used the RUVr method84 implemented in the RUVSeq v.1.18.0 Bioconductor package. We performed a first pass edgeR analysis, up to and including the glmFit() step with the covariates listed above, excluding the RUVr covariates. Then we used residuals() with argument type = \u2018deviance\u2019 to obtain a matrix of deviance residuals. The specified number of unwanted factors (RUVr covariates) used in final analyses were then estimated by the RUVr function using log(CPM) expression values and the residuals. The number of unwanted factors was selected based on separation of groups in PC plots using normalized and adjusted gene-expression values and checking that histograms of differential expression P values showed a uniform or anti-conservative pattern.\nDifferential expression and gene set enrichment analysis\nDifferential expression analysis between groups with covariate adjustment using the covariates listed above was performed for expressed genes using edgeR (estimateDisp, glmFit and glmLRT with default arguments) in R. Genes were considered differentially expressed if FDR < 0.05. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was done separately for upregulated genes and downregulated genes using Metascape v.3.5.20240101 and is summarized in Supplementary Table 15 and Fig. 5f.\nGWAS-DEG enrichment analysis\nBefore doing the GWAS-DEG enrichment analysis, we converted the mouse gene symbols to their human orthologues, using a two-step process. First, we used the alias2SymbolTable function in the Limma R package85 v.3.58.1 to map any gene aliases to their corresponding main symbols. Subsequently, the resulting gene symbols were converted to human orthologues using the MGI orthologue table86. If there were multiple mapping candidates, all possible conversions were applied. For example, if a mouse gene had multiple human orthologues, records with all the relevant human gene symbols were generated. This standardized gene nomenclature enabled cross-species comparisons in subsequent analyses.\nTo do the GWAS-DEG enrichment analysis for microglia isolated from Li-deficient mice, we used MAGMA87 v.1.10. The gene set of DEGs identified by microglia bulk RNA-seq analysis was used and the summary statistics from the GWAS catalogue AD (accession ID: MONDO_0004975)88 were obtained and formatted for MAGMA input. The GWAS catalogue AD contains GWAS records from multiple studies. If multiple records were found for the same variant, we retained the entry with the lowest P value. Gene-set analysis was conducted using the default MAGMA settings, with multiple testing correction applied to account for the number of gene sets tested. Enrichment results were considered significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05.\nOverlap of mouse and human DEGs\nTo assess the overlap between DEGs derived from our transcriptomic analyses and DEGs derived from the analysis of human brain samples with varying degrees of AD pathology15 (Fig. 3d), we first converted mouse gene symbols to their human orthologues, as described above. We matched the cell types analysed in our mouse studies with those analysed in humans15. To assess the statistical significance of the overlap between the two DEG sets, we did a Fisher\u2019s exact test. To control for multiple comparisons arising from the analysis of different cell types and DEG directions (upregulated and downregulated), we adjusted the P values using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure. Two sets of adjusted P values were calculated (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 8): one set for the overlap of genes upregulated in both datasets (indicated in red), and another for the overlap of genes downregulated in both datasets (indicated in blue).\nProteome analysis by mass spectrometry\nThe proteomic analysis was done at the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry. Hippocampal homogenates from Li-deficient and control 3xTg mice containing an equal amount (100 \u00b5g) of protein were reduced with 200 mM tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP) at 55 \u00b0C for 1 h, then alkylated with 375 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Proteins were precipitated using the methanol/chloroform/water precipitation method and then digested with trypsin overnight at 37 \u00b0C. TMT labelling of digested samples was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (ThermoFisher). In brief, TMT labelling reagents were dissolved with 41 \u00b5l anhydrous acetonitrile, and an equal volume of TMT reagent mix was added to each sample. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 8 \u00b5l of 5% hydroxylamine. Equal amounts of peptides from each sample were combined and dried in a SpeedVac. The peptides were then separated using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system with a PolyWAX LP column (PolyLC), 200 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 5 \u03bcm and 300 A running under electrostatic repulsion\u2013hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) mode conditions. Peptides were separated across a 90-minute gradient from 0% buffer A (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid) to 75% buffer B (30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with 20 fractions collected by time. Each fraction was dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid solution before analysis by mass spectrometry. Each ERLIC fraction was submitted for a single liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiment that was done on a Q Exactive HF-X High Resolution Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher) coupled with an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC (Thermo Fisher) at the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry. Peptides were first isolated on a trapping cartridge (300 \u00b5m \u00d7 5 mm PepMap Neo C18 trap cartridge, Thermo Scientific) before separation on an analytical column (\u00b5PAC, C18 pillar surface, 50-cm bed, Thermo Scientific). The LC gradient was as follows: 2\u201327% in mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 70 min and increased to 98% mobile phase B for 15 min at a flow rate of 300 nl min\u22121. The mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent mode for all analyses. Electrospray-positive ionization was enabled with a voltage of 2.1 kV. A full scan ranging from 400 to 1,600 m/z was done with a mass resolution of 12 \u00d7 104 and an automated gain control (AGC) target set to 1 \u00d7 106.\nProteomics quality control\nThe top three most intensive precursor ions from each scan were used for MS2 fragmentation (normalized collision energy of 32) at a mass resolution of 3.0 \u00d7 104 and an AGC of 1 \u00d7 105. The dynamic exclusion was set at 50 s with a precursor isolation window of 1.2 m/z. Raw data were submitted for analysis in Proteome Discoverer 3.0 software (Thermo Scientific). The MS/MS data were searched against the UniProt reviewed Mus musculus (mouse) database along with known contaminants, such as human keratins and common lab contaminants. Sequest HT searches were performed using the following guidelines: a 10-ppm MS tolerance and 0.02-Da MS/MS tolerance; trypsin digestion with up to two missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da) on cysteine, TMT 6-plex tags on peptide amino termini and lysine residue (+229.163 Da) were set as static modification; oxidation (+15.995 Da) of methionine was set as variable modification; minimum required peptide length was set to \u22656 amino acids. At least one unique peptide per protein group was required to identify proteins. Of 13,404 proteins identified, only n = 3,392 proteins were identified with high confidence (MS2 spectra assignment, FDR < 0.01 on both protein and peptide level by applying the target-decoy database search by Percolator) and were included in the statistical analysis, as per the standard procedures of the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry89,90,91. The sample labels were control (samples 1, 3, 5 and 7) and Li-deficient (samples 2, 4, 6 and 8) and were all 3xTg homozygous females, aged 15 months (treatment from 6 to 15 months of age). An ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was used to assess differences in protein abundance between Li-deficient and control samples. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method to control the FDR. Proteins with an adjusted P < 0.05 were considered differentially abundant (Supplementary Table 7). The proteins identified with high confidence and included in the statistical analysis are listed in Supplementary Table 7. All other proteins, identified with lower confidence, can be accessed from the files deposited at the ProteomeXchange Consortium through the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD063039. This represents 21 files, including one .msf file (containing all search results: peptide-spectrum matches, peptide groups, protein groups, modifications, scores, FDR and metadata) and 20 .raw files (containing MS1/2 spectra and metadata), one for each of the 20 fractions analysed by mass spectrometry.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nStatistical analysis was done using GraphPad software v.10.3.0 (507). The statistical tests used are noted in the figure legends. Throughout the paper, all tests are two sided and unpaired unless stated otherwise. A significance level of 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis. The sample size, age and sex of experimental animals, as well as the summary of each statistical test (including degrees of freedom, confidence intervals and P values) can be found in the Source Data file. All animal experiments were done once per condition using biologically independent samples (individual animals), with group sizes indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Representative immunolabelling images shown in the figures are from one animal per group, selected from multiple animals that consistently showed similar results.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe snRNA-seq, microglia RNA-seq and LiO RNA-seq data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository (GSE272344, GSE275326 and GSE295788).

A\u03b2 immunolabeling in the cortex of 12-month-old J20 mice. Laser ablation ICP-MS was performed on an adjacent unfixed section to quantify Li in A\u03b2 plaques (P; white circles) and in neighboring non-plaque regions (NP; yellow circles). The ratios of Li levels in P to NP regions are shown (right) for n = 4 mice. e, A\u03b2 immunolabeling of the cortex in J20 mice at 3 months of age, prior to onset of A\u03b2 deposition, and 12 months of age, following widespread A\u03b2 deposition. Cortical samples were subfractionated from 3-month-old (WT n = 6; J20 n = 7) and 12-month-old (WT n = 9, J20 n = 7) mice and Li in non-plaque fractions was measured by ICP-MS (middle and right panels).

      "text": "Mild cognitive impairment\n| Mild cognitive impairment | |\n|---|---|\n| Other names | Incipient dementia, isolated memory impairment, mild neurocognitive disorder |\n| Specialty | Neurology |\n| Symptoms | Can include memory impairments (amnestic) or cognitive problems like impaired decision making, language, or visuospatial skills (non-amnestic) |\n| Usual onset | Typically appears in adults 65 or older |\n| Types | Amnestic, non-amnestic |\n| Risk factors | Age, family history, cardiovascular disease |\n| Diagnostic method | Based on symptoms assessed by a clinical neuropsychologist through observations, neuroimaging, and blood tests |\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a diagnosis that reflects an intermediate stage of cognitive impairment that is often, but not always, a transitional phase from cognitive changes in normal aging to those typically found in dementia,[1] especially dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's dementia).[2] MCI may include both memory and non-memory neurocognitive impairments.[3] About 50 percent of people diagnosed with MCI have Alzheimer's disease and go on to develop Alzheimer's dementia within five years. MCI can also serve as an early indicator for other types of dementia, although MCI may also remain stable or remit.[4] Many definitions of MCI exist. A common feature of many of these is that MCI involves cognitive impairments that are measurable but that are not significant enough to interfere with instrumental activities of daily living.[1]\nThe DSM-5 introduces the concept of mild neurocognitive disorder (mNCD), which is designed to be largely equivalent to MCI.[5] The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) refers to MCI as \"Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (MND)\".[6] It is controversial whether MCI should be used as a diagnosis.[7]\nThe definition of MCI continues to evolve. Academic discussion revolves around whether MCI should be classified or diagnosed algorithmically or clinically, the reliability of clinical judgment, stability of the diagnosis over time, and the utility or predictivity of biomarkers. Differences in the definition and implementation of the MCI construct can explain some discrepancies between research studies.[8]\nClassification\n[edit]MCI can present with a variety of symptoms, but is divided generally into two types.[4]\nAmnestic MCI (aMCI) is mild cognitive impairment with memory loss as the predominant symptom; aMCI is frequently seen as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease.[4][3][9] Studies suggest that these individuals tend to progress to probable Alzheimer's disease at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year.[needs update][10] It is possible that being diagnosed with cognitive decline may serve as an indicator of MCI.[11]\nNonamnestic MCI (naMCI) is mild cognitive impairment in which impairments in domains other than memory (for example, language, visuospatial, executive) are more prominent.[4][12] It may be further divided as nonamnestic single- or multiple-domain MCI, and these individuals are believed to be more likely to convert to other dementias (for example, dementia with Lewy bodies).[13]\nCauses\n[edit]Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be caused due to alteration in the brain triggered during early stages of Alzheimer's disease, to other causes, or to a combination of causes.[14][15] Brain damage, brain injury, delirium and prolonged substance abuse can cause MCI. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder can cause MCI. Risk factors of both dementia and MCI are the same, and include: aging, genetics, and cardiovascular disease.[16]\nDiagnosis\n[edit]The diagnosis of MCI requires clinical judgement,[10] possibly including clinical observation, neuroimaging,[17] blood tests and neuropsychological testing. MCI may be diagnosed differently by different clinicians using different definitions or criteria, but generally including:[18]\n- Evidence of modest cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains, based on either: concern about cognitive decline from the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or a clinician, or modest impairment in cognitive performance documented by standardized neuropsychological testing.\n- The cognitive deficits do not interfere with capacity for independence in everyday activities. However, greater effort, compensatory strategies, or accommodation may be required for complex tasks.\nNeuropathology\n[edit]Magnetic resonance imaging can observe deterioration, including progressive loss of gray matter in the brain, from MCI to full-blown Alzheimer dementia.[19] A technique known as PiB PET imaging is used to show the sites and shapes of beta amyloid deposits in living subjects using a 11C tracer that binds selectively to such deposits.[20] Individuals with MCI may have increased oxidative damage in their nuclear and mitochondrial brain DNA.[21]\nTreatment\n[edit]The American Academy of Neurology's (AAN) clinical practice guideline on MCI from January 2018 stated that clinicians should identify modifiable risk factors in individuals with MCI, assess functional impairments, provide treatment for any behavioral or neuropsychiatric symptoms, and monitor the individual's cognitive status over time.[4] It also stated that medications which cause cognitive impairment should be discontinued or avoided if possible.[4] Due to the lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors in individuals with MCI, the AAN guideline stated that clinicians who choose to prescribe them for the treatment of MCI must inform patients about the lack of evidence supporting this therapy.[4] The guideline also indicated that clinicians should recommend that individuals with MCI engage in regular physical exercise for cognitive symptomatic benefits;[4] clinicians may also recommend cognitive training, which appears to provide some symptomatic benefit in certain cognitive measures.[4] Current evidence suggests that cognition-based interventions do improve mental performance (i.e. memory, executive function, attention, and speed) in older adults and people with mild cognitive impairment.[22] Especially, immediate and delayed verbal recall resulted in higher performance gains from memory training.\nDiet improvements are likely beneficial to MCI. However, there is currently limited evidence to form a strong conclusion to recommend particular carbohydrate supplements in preventing or reducing cognitive decline in older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment.[23]\nAccording to research conducted in England, people with MCI often do not receive adequate care and support in healthcare settings. This leaves them and their families in a limbo with uncertainty regarding their futures and the fear of possibly developing dementia. The lack of services also fails to point them to effective ways to prevent dementia such as exercise and social contact. Successful dementia prevention services would have to be tailored to people's preferences and backgrounds.[24][25]\nAs MCI may represent a prodromal state to clinical Alzheimer's dementia, treatments for Alzheimer's disease could potentially be useful.[26] Of these, rivastigmine failed to stop or slow progression to Alzheimer's disease or to improve cognitive function for individuals with mild cognitive impairment;[27] donepezil showed only minor, short-term benefits and was associated with significant side effects.[28]\nOutlook\n[edit]MCI does not usually interfere with daily life.[4]\nPrevalence\n[edit]The prevalence of MCI varies by age.[4] The prevalence of MCI among different age groups is as follows: 6.7% for ages 60\u201364; 8.4% for ages 65\u201369, 10.1% for ages 70\u201374, 14.8% for ages 75\u201379, and 25.2% for ages 80\u201384.[4] After a two-year follow-up, the cumulative incidence of dementia among individuals who are over 65 years old and were diagnosed with MCI was found to be 14.9%.[4]\nDue to the emphasis shifting to the earlier diagnosis of dementia, more people are assessed who report memory problems. In turn this also leads diagnosing more people who might have MCI which is a risk factor for dementia.[24][25] Globally, approximately 16% of the population over the age of 70 experiences some type of MCI.[medical citation needed]\nHistory\n[edit]MCI was initially conceptualized as an intermediate stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.[29] In 2003 international criteria for MCI were developed that broadened the definition to include people with cognitive impairment due to any etiology.[30] Furthermore, the definition of Alzheimer's disease expanded to include earlier, non-dementia, stages. So now, MCI can either be a diagnosis associated with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., people with MCI that also have Alzheimer's disease) or a diagnosis of cognitive decline due to a cause other than Alzheimer's disease; it is no longer considered to be a stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.[31]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b Petersen RC, Smith GE, Waring SC, Ivnik RJ, Tangalos EG, Kokmen E (1999). \"Mild cognitive impairment: clinical characterization and outcome\".

      "text": "A protein long blamed for the brain damage seen in Alzheimer's disease has now been found in astonishingly high levels in healthy newborn babies, challenging decades of medical dogma.\nThe discovery could transform our understanding of both brain development and Alzheimer's disease itself. The protein, called p-tau217, has been viewed as a hallmark of neurodegeneration \u2013 yet a new study reveals it's even more abundant in the brains of healthy infants.\nRather than being toxic, p-tau217 may be essential for building the brain during early development.\nTo understand why this matters, it helps to know what tau normally does. In healthy brains, tau is a protein that helps keep brain cells stable and allows them to communicate \u2013 essential functions for memory and overall brain function. Think of it like the beams inside a building, supporting brain cells so they can function properly.\nRelated: The Sad Case of The Youngest Person Ever Diagnosed With Alzheimer's\nBut in Alzheimer's disease, tau gets chemically changed into a different form called p-tau217. Instead of doing its normal job, this altered protein builds up and clumps together inside brain cells, forming tangles that impair cell function and lead to memory loss typical of the disease.\nFor years, scientists have assumed high levels of p-tau217 always spell trouble. The new research suggests they've been wrong.\nAn international team led by the University of Gothenburg analysed blood samples from over 400 people, including healthy newborns, young adults, elderly adults and those with Alzheimer's disease. What they found was striking.\nPremature babies had the highest concentrations of p-tau217 of anyone tested. Full-term babies came second. The earlier the birth, the higher the protein levels \u2013 yet these infants were perfectly healthy.\nThese levels dropped sharply during the first months of life, remained very low in healthy adults, then rose again in people with Alzheimer's \u2013 though never reaching the sky-high levels seen in newborns.\nThe pattern suggests p-tau217 plays a crucial role in early brain development, particularly in areas controlling movement and sensation that mature early in life. Rather than causing harm, the protein appears to support the building of new neural networks.\nRethinking Alzheimer's disease\nThe implications are profound. First, the findings clarify how to interpret blood tests for p-tau217, recently approved by US regulators to aid dementia diagnosis. High levels don't always signal disease \u2013 in babies, they're part of normal, healthy brain development.\nMore intriguingly, the research raises a fundamental question: why can newborn brains safely handle massive amounts of p-tau217 when the same protein wreaks havoc in older adults?\nIf scientists can unlock this protective mechanism, it could revolutionise Alzheimer's treatment. Understanding how infant brains manage high tau levels without forming deadly tangles might reveal entirely new therapeutic approaches.\nThe findings also challenge a cornerstone of Alzheimer's research. For decades, scientists have believed p-tau217 only increases after another protein, amyloid, starts accumulating in the brain, with amyloid triggering a cascade that leads to tau tangles and dementia.\nBut newborns have no amyloid buildup, yet their p-tau217 levels dwarf those seen in Alzheimer's patients. This suggests the proteins operate independently and that other biological processes \u2013 not just amyloid \u2013 regulate tau throughout life.\nThe research aligns with earlier animal studies. Research in mice showed tau levels peak in early development then fall sharply, mirroring the human pattern. Similarly, studies of foetal neurons found naturally high p-tau levels that decline with age.\nIf p-tau217 is vital for normal brain development, something must switch later in life to make it harmful. Understanding what flips this biological switch \u2013 from protective to destructive \u2013 could point to entirely new ways of preventing or treating Alzheimer's.\nFor decades, Alzheimer's research has focused almost exclusively on the damage caused by abnormal proteins. This study flips that perspective, showing one of these so-called \"toxic\" proteins may actually play a vital, healthy role at the start of life.\nBabies' brains might hold the blueprint for keeping tau in check. Learning its secrets could help scientists develop better ways to preserve cognitive function as we age, transforming our approach to one of medicine's greatest challenges.\nRahul Sidhu, PhD Candidate, Neuroscience, University of Sheffield\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "A new study has revealed for the first time the molecular structure of brains affected by Alzheimer's disease.\nResearchers have produced 3D models of proteins in the brain, including two proteins in particular that are associated with Alzheimer's: beta-amyloid and tau.\nAs scientists continue to work towards treatments for the neurodegenerative disease, it's important to understand as much as we possibly can about it.\nClumps of these proteins in the brain are either a cause of Alzheimer's or a consequence of it \u2013 we're not quite sure which yet \u2013 and thanks to a team from the University of Leeds in the UK, we now have a very detailed look at how they are arranged, right down to the tiniest, microscopic details.\n\"This first glimpse of the structure of molecules inside the human brain offers further clues to what happens to proteins in Alzheimer's disease,\" says neuroscientist Ren\u00e9 Frank from the University of Leeds.\n\"But [it] also sets out an experimental approach that can be applied to better understand a broad range of other devastating neurological diseases.\"\nThe researchers used a number of advanced imaging techniques to scan postmortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's patients, including cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) \u2013 which uses readings from beams of electrons to map out 3D structures of tissue immobilized at very low temperatures.\nCryoET allows imaging without chemical fixation or dehydration disrupting the structure of biological tissue, meaning scientists can now reconstruct 3D volumes of tissue at resolutions a million times smaller than a grain of rice.\n\"Light microscopic characterization of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease brain has formed the basis of diagnostic and disease classification,\" write the researchers in their published paper.\n\"The in situ structure of amyloid in the human brain is unknown.\"\nBy getting such a close look at these proteins, the hope is that we can better understand how the clumps are formed and how they're impacting the brain.\nIn beta-amyloid proteins, a mixture of microscopic thread-like structures called fibrils and other structures were found. In tau proteins, there were clusters of filaments in straight lines, although the arrangement seems to vary depending on where the proteins are in the brain.\nWhile clusters were similar to each other, there were differences across spatial organization, in terms of the way the tau filaments were oriented and twisted, as well as in the size of the beta-amyloid fibrils.\nThis is the first look we've had at these proteins at this level of detail, and it's too early to say anything about the significance of what's been revealed. Now that the technique has been shown to work, it can be tried on tissue from a wider range of brain donors.\nThat will reveal more about how these different proteins look at the different points of Alzheimer's progression \u2013 and by comparing the structures across time, we should be able to see how the disease develops.\nIn fact, the team behind the new study thinks that this approach could be useful in analyzing the root causes of all kinds of neurodegenerative diseases, so we can expect to hear more about it in the future.\n\"Larger cohorts of diverse Alzheimer's disease donors, across different brain regions and at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease, may reveal how the spatial organization of amyloid of different structures relates to individual neuropathological profiles,\" write the researchers.\n\"It will also be important to apply these approaches to other neurodegenerative diseases, many of which share related, or overlapping, types of amyloid neuropathology.\"\nThe research has been published in Nature."

      "text": "Could lithium explain \u2014 and treat \u2014 Alzheimer\u2019s?\nStudy offers new theory of disease and strategy for fighting it\nWhat is the earliest spark that ignites the memory-robbing march of Alzheimer\u2019s disease? Why do some people with Alzheimer\u2019s-like changes in the brain never go on to develop dementia? These questions have bedeviled neuroscientists for decades.\nNow, a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School may have found an answer: lithium deficiency in the brain.\nThe work, published Wednesday in Nature, shows for the first time that lithium occurs naturally in the brain, shields it from neurodegeneration, and maintains the normal function of all major brain cell types. The findings \u2014 10 years in the making \u2014 are based on a series of experiments in mice and on analyses of human brain tissue and blood samples from individuals in various stages of cognitive health.\nThe scientists found that lithium loss in the human brain is one of the earliest changes leading to Alzheimer\u2019s, while in mice, similar lithium depletion accelerated brain pathology and memory decline. The team further found that reduced lithium levels stemmed from binding to amyloid plaques and impaired uptake in the brain. In a final set of experiments, the team found that a novel lithium compound that avoids capture by amyloid plaques restored memory in mice.\nThe results unify decades-long observations in patients, providing a new theory of the disease and a new strategy for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.\nAffecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide, Alzheimer\u2019s disease involves an array of brain abnormalities \u2014 such as clumps of the protein amyloid-beta, neurofibrillary tangles of the protein tau, and loss of a protective protein called REST \u2014 but these never explained the full story of the disease. For instance, some people with such abnormalities show no signs of cognitive decline. And recently developed treatments that target amyloid-beta typically don\u2019t reverse memory loss and only modestly reduce the rate of decline.\nIt\u2019s also clear that genetic and environmental factors affect risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, but scientists haven\u2019t figured out why some people with the same risk factors develop the disease while others don\u2019t.\nLithium, the study authors said, may be a critical missing link.\n\u201cThe idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach,\u201d said senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS, who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate that amyloid-beta is toxic.\nThe study raises hopes that researchers could one day use lithium to treat the disease in its entirety rather than focusing on a single facet such as amyloid-beta or tau, he said.\nOne of the main discoveries in the study is that as amyloid-beta begins to form deposits in the early stages of dementia in both humans and mouse models, it binds to lithium, reducing lithium\u2019s function in the brain. The lower lithium levels affect all major brain-cell types and, in mice, give rise to changes recapitulating Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including memory loss.\nThe authors identified a class of lithium compounds that can evade capture by amyloid-beta. Treating mice with the most potent amyloid-evading compound, called lithium orotate, reversed Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology, prevented brain-cell damage, and restored memory.\nAlthough the findings need to be confirmed in humans through clinical trials, they suggest that measuring lithium levels could help screen for early Alzheimer\u2019s. Moreover, the findings point to the importance of testing amyloid-evading lithium compounds for treatment or prevention.\nOther lithium compounds are already used to treat bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but they are given at much higher concentrations that can be toxic, especially to older people. Yankner\u2019s team found that lithium orotate is effective at one-thousandth that dose \u2014 enough to mimic the natural level of lithium in the brain. Mice treated for nearly their entire adult lives showed no evidence of toxicity.\n\u201cYou have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial,\u201d Yankner said. \u201cBut so far the results are very encouraging.\u201d\nLithium depletion is an early sign of Alzheimer\u2019s\nYankner became interested in lithium while using it to study the neuroprotective protein REST. Discovering whether lithium is found in the human brain and whether its levels change as neurodegeneration develops and progresses, however, required access to brain tissue, which generally can\u2019t be accessed in living people.\nSo the lab partnered with the Rush Memory and Aging Project in Chicago, which has a bank of postmortem brain tissue donated by thousands of study participants across the full spectrum of cognitive health and disease.\nHaving that range was critical because trying to study the brain in the late stages of Alzheimer\u2019s is like looking at a battlefield after a war, said Yankner; there\u2019s a lot of damage and it\u2019s hard to tell how it all started. But in the early stages, \u201cbefore the brain is badly damaged, you can get important clues,\u201d he said.\nLed by first author Liviu Aron, senior research associate in the Yankner Lab, the team used an advanced type of mass spectroscopy to measure trace levels of about 30 different metals in the brains and blood of cognitively healthy people, those in an early stage of dementia called mild cognitive impairment, and those with advanced Alzheimer\u2019s.\nLithium was the only metal that had markedly different levels across groups and changed at the earliest stages of memory loss. Its levels were high in the cognitively healthy donors but greatly diminished in those with mild impairment or full-blown Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThe team replicated the findings in samples obtained from multiple brain banks nationwide.\nThe observation aligned with previous population studies showing that higher lithium levels in the environment, including in drinking water, tracked with lower rates of dementia.\nBut the new study went beyond by directly observing lithium in the brains of people who hadn\u2019t received lithium as a treatment, establishing a range that constitutes normal levels, and demonstrating that lithium plays an essential role in brain physiology.\n\u201cLithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and vitamin C,\u201d Yankner said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s shown that lithium exists at a natural level that\u2019s biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug.\u201d\nThen Yankner and colleagues took things a step further. They demonstrated in mice that lithium depletion isn\u2019t merely linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 it helps drive it.\nLoss of lithium causes the range of Alzheimer\u2019s-related changes\nThe researchers found that feeding healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet brought their brain lithium levels down to a level similar to that in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This appeared to accelerate the aging process, giving rise to brain inflammation, loss of synaptic connections between neurons, and cognitive decline.\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s mouse models, depleted lithium dramatically accelerated the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and structures that resemble neurofibrillary tangles. Lithium depletion also activated inflammatory cells in the brain called microglia, impairing their ability to degrade amyloid; caused the loss of synapses, axons, and neuron-protecting myelin; and accelerated cognitive decline and memory loss \u2014 all hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe mouse experiments further revealed that lithium altered the activity of genes known to raise or lower the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, including the best-known, APOE.\nReplenishing lithium by giving the mice lithium orotate in their water reversed the disease-related damage and restored memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease. Notably, maintaining stable lithium levels in early life prevented Alzheimer\u2019s onset \u2014 a finding that confirmed that lithium fuels the disease process.\n\u201cWhat impresses me the most about lithium is the widespread effect it has on the various manifestations of Alzheimer\u2019s. I really have not seen anything quite like it all my years of working on this disease,\u201d said Yankner.\nA promising avenue for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\nA few limited clinical trials of lithium for Alzheimer\u2019s disease have shown some efficacy, but the lithium compounds they used \u2014 such as the clinical standard, lithium carbonate \u2014 can be toxic to aging people at the high doses normally used in the clinic.\nThe new research explains why: Amyloid-beta was sequestering these other lithium compounds before they could work. Yankner and colleagues found lithium orotate by developing a screening platform that searches a library of compounds for those that might bypass amyloid-beta. Other researchers can now use the platform to seek additional amyloid-evading lithium compounds that might be even more effective.\n\u201cOne of the most galvanizing findings for us was that there were profound effects at this exquisitely low dose,\u201d Yankner said.\nIf replicated in further studies, the researchers say lithium screening through routine blood tests may one day offer a way to identify at-risk individuals who would benefit from treatment to prevent or delay Alzheimer\u2019s onset.\nStudying lithium levels in people who are resistant to Alzheimer\u2019s as they age might help scientists establish a target level that they could help patients maintain to prevent onset of the disease, Yankner said.\nSince lithium has not yet been shown to be safe or effective in protecting against neurodegeneration in humans, Yankner emphasizes that people should not take lithium compounds on their own. But he expressed cautious optimism that lithium orotate or a similar compound will move forward into clinical trials in the near future and could ultimately change the story of Alzheimer\u2019s treatment.\n\u201cMy hope is that lithium will do something more fundamental than anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies, not just lessening but reversing cognitive decline and improving patients\u2019 lives,\u201d he said.\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health."

      "text": "There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease yet, but detecting it early can make a big difference. It gives scientists a better chance to study it in depth and gives patients and families more time to plan and get support.\nNow, US researchers have uncovered four telltale medical sequences that appear to predict the onset of the progressive neurological disorder.\nIn the large new study, scientists analyzed health records from 24,473 people diagnosed with Alzheimer's, searching for patterns that typically led up to their diagnosis \u2013 and crucially, how different factors combined in sequence.\n\"We found that multi-step trajectories can indicate greater risk factors for Alzheimer's disease than single conditions,\" says Mingzhou Fu, a bioinformatician at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\n\"Understanding these pathways could fundamentally change how we approach early detection and prevention.\"\nRelated: Scientists Find 2 Existing Drugs Can Reverse Alzheimer's Brain Damage in Mice\nFour \"trajectory clusters\" were identified by the team, which are essentially different routes to Alzheimer's, like step-by-step directions towards a destination on a map.\nAnalysis of an independent dataset from across the US found people who follow one of these trajectories tend to have a significantly higher risk of Alzheimer's.\nThe four clusters were mental health (psychiatric conditions), encephalopathy (brain dysfunctions that gradually get worse), mild cognitive impairment (declining mental dexterity), and vascular disease (heart and blood conditions).\nThe researchers used an algorithmic approach called dynamic time warping to standardize the duration and sequence of health issues across these thousands of database records, and find patterns that matched up between patients.\nIn the mental health cluster, for example, anxiety often came first, followed by depression, which often eventually led to Alzheimer's. In the vascular cluster, conditions like hypertension and joint disorders were common starting points on the road to Alzheimer's.\nAcross the four clusters, thousands of different individual trajectories were identified, varying in terms of their progression speeds and associated Alzheimer's risk level. It shows just how complex the road to Alzheimer's can be.\n\"By unveiling distinct and interconnected routes to Alzheimer's disease, this approach offers insights that may improve risk assessment, timely diagnosis, and targeted interventions,\" write the researchers in their published paper.\nTo test their findings, the team ran their model on a separate set of health records from 8,512 people. The pathways identified by the study were far more likely to be present in those with Alzheimer's, adding weight to the results.\nOf course, understanding more about how Alzheimer's progresses in the body could help us stop it: there may be blocks that can be put in place along the way that prevent the disease from fully developing, or at least reduce the risk.\nAs always, there's plenty more work to do here. The researchers want to study broader groups of people with and without Alzheimer's to further validate their findings, and expand the work to more types of dementia.\nWhile these four clusters don't imply direct cause and effect or guarantee someone will develop Alzheimer's, they're likely to be important in future assessments of patients \u2013 and in figuring out how to stop this devastating disease.\n\"Recognizing these sequential patterns rather than focusing on diagnoses in isolation may help clinicians improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,\" says neurologist Timothy Chang, from UCLA.\nThe research has been published in eBioMedicine."

      "text": "Clinical trials are studies designed to test treatments and diagnostic tools on volunteers prior to use on patients.\nFor medical practitioners to ethically prescribe a drug, device, therapy, or test, they have to be confident it not only works, but it produces few significant side-effects and doesn't interfere with other tests and treatments.\nGovernments around the globe have administrative bodies that require a product's clinical testing before it can be legally used in healthcare. This doesn't just apply to new inventions - it can include traditional practices that have been around for generations. On average, around 14 percent of medications being tested make it all the way through for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration.\nThere are typically several levels or 'phases' of clinical trial scientists must move through before the product can be considered by a government authority for public use.\nPreclinical research\nTo show a new medication or procedure will be safe on human volunteers, researchers will do their homework.\nThis often means running small, relatively inexpensive tests on animals or tissue samples to rule out dangerous complications. Not only will it help reveal any potentially life-threatening consequences, it helps researchers better calculate things like appropriate dosages and testing conditions.\nPhase 1 clinical trial\nThe first phase of clinical testing assesses safety. It can take just a few weeks to months to complete, and involves at least 20 healthy volunteers who are paid for their time and risk.\nThe goal of these studies is a measure of physiological effects on people who don't have any significant health conditions. The measures include details on how a drug is metabolised, absorbed, and excreted.\nPhase 2 clinical trial\nThe second phase of clinical testing assesses efficacy. It generally involves hundreds of patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, treatment or test, and can take months or even years to process completely.\nTo rule out patient or researcher expectations influencing how outcomes are interpreted, many phase 2 trials are based on experimental designs that help reduce bias. This can include randomly assigning test subjects to one of two groups - one that includes the method or material being tested, and a second group using tests that superficially resemble the first group.\nThis alternative 'fake' group is often referred to as a sham or placebo. Comparisons between the groups can help determine whether apparent benefits could potentially be the result of patient expectations.\nPhase 3 clinical trial\nThe third phase of clinical testing compares risks and benefits. It's designed to expand on the results of phase 2 trials, providing necessary details on less common side effects, potential conflicts, or long-term complications.\nThey typically involve hundreds to thousands of patients and can last years, providing government administrators and medical practitioners with an appropriate level of information to help them determine whether the medical tool or drug being tested is worth its costs and risks.\nPost-clinical research\nSometimes there are surveillance or 'phase 4' trials which continue to follow up patients in the field over a long period of time, to collect information on cost effectiveness or long-term risks and benefits.\nAll topic-based articles are determined by fact checkers to be correct and relevant at the time of publishing.

      "text": "Vitamin is a term used to describe the range of organic compounds an organism produces in insufficient quantities (if at all), yet still requires for important functions in its body.\nTo acquire these essential micronutrients, the organism must scavenge them from appropriate food sources. Since organisms make these 'vital' molecules in varying amounts, a much-needed nutrient for one living thing won't be scarce enough to be considered a vitamin in another. For example, dogs synthesize their own vitamin C (in their livers), but fish, birds, guinea pigs, and humans cannot.\nThese chemicals carry out a wide variety of tasks to help an organism grow, reproduce, or simply survive. Some act as signals, regulating metabolism of other materials. Others help enzymes work either directly as a cofactor, or indirectly in the production of one.\nWho discovered the first vitamins?\nThere was no single discovery that established the category of nutrients we now call vitamins. By the late 19th century, chemistry and biology had combined to provide a series of insights into the complexity of human nutrition.\nScientists were realizing there had to be more to a healthy diet than the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and minerals. Various studies on animal growth and development, many involving the modification of milk, pointed to the existence of factors essential for life that were present in extremely small concentrations.\nIn 1901, Dutch scientist Gerrit Grijns speculated that a nutrient deficiency could be responsible for outbreaks of a devastating disease called beri-beri in Indonesia. Further writing by his colleague, Christian Eijkman, inspired a Polish biochemist with undoubtedly one of the coolest names in science, Kazimierz Funk, to dig deeper, uncovering a specific kind of nitrogen compound (called an amine) that he maintained could prevent the illness.\nDubbed a 'vital amine', Funk's discovery of vitamin B3, or niacin, gave us both the term vitamin and the first clear link between absence of an organic essential micronutrient and a disease.\nThough technically a deficiency in the closely related vitamin B1 (thymine) is what's responsible for beri-beri, the finding sparked a series of findings associating various compounds with important bodily functions.\nWhat are some examples of vitamins?\nFor humans, there are just over a dozen compounds that are currently considered to be vitamins. Some are more easily soluble in fat, others in water, and can be found in select sources of meats, greens, nuts, and fungi. Here are some of the most common examples you may have taken in the past:\nVitamin A covers a small group of closely related compounds involved in regulating growth and development of cells throughout our body. Most active forms are retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid, with deficiencies having severe impacts on fetal development, immunity, and vision. Preformed vitamin A, or retinol, can be absorbed in the form of carotenoids in fruit and vegetables.\nVitamin B, or B complex vitamins, is a family of eight essential nutrients: thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9), and cobalamin (B12). Their functions are closely related, activating enzymes that build up or break down other materials involved in things like DNA repair, energy production, and signaling molecules in the brain. Most can't be stored in the body, which means a healthy diet in things like greens, fish, eggs, and organ meats.\nVitamin C, or ascorbic acid, has a variety of roles in our body, from helping us absorb iron to wound repair, to removing reactive oxidative species. Since we can't retain large stores of the compound, it depletes quickly and needs to be replenished with a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables. Historically, its absence in fresh greens on long voyages has been linked with the disease scurvy - a condition eventually fixed with provision of longer-lasting citrus fruits and pickled cabbage. However, it is becoming increasingly common again in some of the world's richest countries.\nWhy are vitamins named after letters?\nIn 1916, a paper by US biochemists Cornelia Kennedy and Elmer V. McCollum used the letters A and B to describe fat and water soluble organic compounds considered as vital accessory factors in nutrition. The system was soon expanded to include other vitamins discovered in ensuing years, with vitamin B split into two forms following the discovery of riboflavin in the early 1920s as a component of the original compound.\nWhat is vitamin K?\nOver time, vitamins designated letters F, G (now riboflavin) and H, have been relabelled, while the letter in vitamin K stands for the Danish spelling of coagulation, named so because of its involvement in this process. For this reason, vitamin K injections are given to newborns immediately after birth in many countries, to aid with blood clotting.\nHow many vitamins should I take?\nWhile vitamins are important to health, most of us easily get the levels we need with a modern, balanced diet. Many studies have shown no long-term benefit in taking daily multivitamin tablets. In fact, there's evidence it can be better to get vitamins from your food if possible.\nDo I need to take a daily multivitamin?\nUnless a doctor has diagnosed that you have a deficiency in a particular vitamin, it's unlikely that you need to take daily supplements for long periods of time.\nCan you take too many vitamins?\nOn top of that, it is possible to make yourself unwell from taking too many vitamins. Even water soluble vitamins such as vitamin C and vitamin B (which doesn't stay in the body) can cause symptoms such as diarrhea or heartburn if you take too much.\nOther vitamins, such as vitamin A, have been linked to birth defects if taken to excess while a woman is pregnant.\nAll Explainers are determined by fact checkers to be correct and relevant at the time of publishing.

All but a mere 1 percent of studies show promise, with life-changing treatments still on the horizon. But there is still reason to keep up hope.\nWhat is Alzheimer's disease?\nAlzheimer's disease is a chronic neurological condition characterised by worsening short term memory loss. Symptoms progress over time as the condition deteriorates to include challenges in finding the right words, disorientation, loss of social skills, and emotional changes.\nRoughly 30 percent of people over the age of 85 are affected by the disease, making it a critical issue as improvements in healthcare see a rise in the average age of the world's population.\nThe disease is itself rarely fatal, often because those in progressed stages of Alzheimer's are at a greater risk of developing serious infections and other life-threatening complications.\nWhat causes Alzheimer's disease?\nThe condition is caused by the steady loss of neurons, typically beginning in the wrinkled outer layer known as the cortex before affecting structures deeper inside the brain.\nOngoing research continues to provide details on this degeneration, with most explanations pointing at a build-up of proteins called beta-amyloid. Changes in the structure of another protein - called tau - might also be responsible. Together, these altered proteins seem to affect how neurons communicate and function, eventually leading to the cell's death.\nMany cases of Alzheimer's disease appear to be heavily influenced by various genes, though it is clearly a complicated condition affected by both inherited and environmental factors.\nTreatments based on increasing levels of a key neurotransmitter have been found to provide temporary improvement, but as of yet there is no way to prevent or reverse degeneration."

      "text": "A little-known form of dementia, easily mistaken for Alzheimer's disease, now has a brand new name and specific diagnostic criteria.\nResearchers are calling it limbic-predominant amnestic neurodegenerative syndrome (LANS), and they hope that their work makes it easier for medical professionals to care for and counsel patients with various forms of memory loss.\nLANS presents with a different set of brain changes to Alzheimer's, and it tends to progress slower and with milder symptoms, mostly impacting those over the age of 80.\nSimilar to Alzheimer's, a definitive diagnosis is only available upon autopsy.\nTo help those living with memory loss, neurologist Nick Corriveau-Lecavalier and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, along with other institutions in the US and Spain, have provided an official framework by which to distinguish LANS from Alzheimer's.\n\"In our clinical work, we see patients whose memory symptoms appear to mimic Alzheimer's disease, but when you look at their brain imaging or biomarkers, it's clear they don't have Alzheimer's,\" says senior author and Mayo neurologist David Jones.\n\"Until now, there has not been a specific medical diagnosis to point to, but now we can offer them some answers.\"\nThe more precise diagnosis considers factors such as age, the severity of memory loss, brain scans, and biomarkers.\nIn a trial, the new diagnostic criteria successfully categorized dozens of patients who had died with Alzheimer's disease or LANS, based only on health data from when they were alive. The success rate was not perfect, but the accuracy was over 70 percent.\nAs it turns out, the set of clinical criteria for LANS has a high likelihood of being associated with brain changes caused by limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy \u2013 aka LATE.\nIn the study, most patients with LATE brain changes scored the highest for a LANS diagnosis, but the authors note that while the two terms are \"highly associated\", LANS can technically cover any form of dementia that leads to degeneration of the limbic system.\nThe brain changes in LATE are highly common in elderly folk, occurring in about 40 percent of autopsied brains beyond age 85. They are marked by a buildup of protein, called TP-43, in the limbic system, which is a brain network involved in regulating memory, emotions, and behavior.\nThese brain changes are distinctly different to the tau protein tangles that occur in Alzheimer's disease, and which tend to accumulate in parts of the brain involved in spatial awareness and spatial reasoning.\nIn 2019, an international consensus report recommended that LATE brain changes should be part of the dementia classification system.\nAlzheimer's and LANS have significant overlaps in symptoms, which means they are often conflated. Sometimes LANS can even arise alongside Alzheimer's, complicating matters even more.\nBut the two diseases are distinct.\nSifting through available studies on both forms of dementia, researchers at the Mayo Clinic have identified some key clinical differences in how LANS and Alzheimer's present in patients.\nPatients with LANS tend to first suffer from episodic memory loss, which reduces their ability to recall contextual details or names of objects and people, and reduces verbal fluency. But their visuospatial processing is relatively preserved compared to those with Alzheimer's.\nAdditionally, MRI studies suggest that a loss of volume in the hippocampus is associated with LANS more so than Alzheimer's, where losses in volume tend to be focused in the neocortex.\nLANS also appears to come on slower and with more mild effects than the faster rate of decline seen in Alzheimer's disease, and the even steeper rate of decline observed in those who have both LANS and Alzheimer's.\n\"One example that can be a potential source of clinical conundrums is the limbic variant Alzheimer's disease, where tau predominantly localizes to the limbic system and therefore qualifies for LANS,\" the authors explain.\n\"The advanced LANS criteria in combination with visual assessment of tau-PET can help in determining which pathology has the highest likelihood of driving clinical symptoms.\"\nDisentangling the various forms and mechanisms of dementia is clearly tricky work, but the team at Mayo plans to continue refining their LANS classification.\nThe study was published in Brain Communications."
