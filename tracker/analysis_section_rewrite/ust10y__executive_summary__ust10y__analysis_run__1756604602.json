      "feedback": "Your draft fails the acceptance gate because mortgage rates are not a canonical handle. Add an explicit mapping to a canonical rate (e.g., “mortgage rates ≈ 1.25‑2.5 pp above ust10y (LF0UUL917)”) so that each sentence links the view to a handle with sign and magnitude. Condense the prose to 4–6 bullet‑style sentences, each ending with a single citation: 1) Current spread and term‑premium drivers; 2) Base‑case 6.5‑7 % through 2027; 3) Upside 5‑6 % if Fed cuts or expands balance sheet; 4) Key catalysts (Fed meeting 16‑17 Sep, CPI 15 Oct, balance‑sheet 1 Nov, housing‑starts 5 Nov) with inline IDs; 5) Upside risks (Fed hike, inflation spike, debt surge) with IDs; 6) Watch signals (Fed statements, balance‑sheet trend, housing data) with IDs. Remove any redundant wording and ensure every claim has a causal chain to the mapped handle. This will satisfy the handle‑mapping and catalyst‑window requirements while keeping the brief executive‑style.",
