  "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexican-American clothing designer Willy Chavarria has apologized for an Adidas sandal he created after being accused by Mexican authorities of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d for imitating an Indigenous shoe design.\n\nThe design launched by Adidas, known as the Oaxaca Slip On, is a black sandal with braided leather straps attached to a chunky sports shoe sole.\n\nMexican artisans and authorities say the intricate leather braids look strikingly similar to the traditional footwear known as huaraches made by the Zapotec Indigenous people in Oaxaca, produced mostly in the town of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag.\n\nThey have accused the brand and Chavarria of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d and of copying the design without the permission of the Indigenous community. Authorities were quick to note that cultural Mexican designs have long been copied by major brands before, and said they planned to tighten laws to protect Mexican designs.\n\nChavarria responded to mounting criticisms in comments sent to The Associated Press on Tuesday. In a statement addressed to the \u201cpeople of Oaxaca,\u201d he said that the design was intended to \u201cto honor the powerful cultural and artistic spirit of Oaxaca and its creative communities \u2014 a place whose beauty and resistance have inspired me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am deeply sorry that the shoe was appropriated in this design and not developed in direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community,\u201d Chavarria wrote. \u201cThis falls short of the respect and collaborative approach that Oaxaca, the Zapotec community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and its people deserve.\u201d\n\nChavarria is a Mexican-American designer, who has risen to fame for his designs exploring Chicano, or Mexican-American, culture, often mixing Mexican themes with American products. His designs include sweaters reading \u201cChicano\u201d in red, scripted font, and styles with the Mexican flag and cowboy hats reminiscent of northern Mexican culture.\n\nIn recent months, Chavarria also was put in the spotlight for a show at Paris Fashion Week that was intended as criticism of the Trump administration's deportation policy.\n\nChavarria's comments came days after Adidas made a public apology for the design, and in a statement said it was reaffirming \u201cour commitment to collaborate with Yalalag in a respectful dialogue that honors their cultural legacy.\u201d Last week, in a letter to Oaxacan state officials, the company requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can \u201crepair the damage\u201d to Indigenous populations.\n\n\u201cAdidas recognizes and values the cultural richness of Mexico\u2019s Indigenous communities and the meaning of their artisanal heritage,\u201d it wrote in a statement.",

      "text": "Mexican authorities accuse Adidas of cultural appropriation in their sandal design\nMexican authorities are accusing Adidas of plagiarizing artisans in southern Mexico a new sandal design appearing strikingly similar to the criss-crossed leather in indigenous footwear known as huaraches.\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Mexican authorities are accusing sportswear company Adidas of plagiarizing artisans in southern Mexico, alleging that a new sandal design is strikingly similar to the traditional Indigenous footwear known as huaraches.\nThe controversy has fueled accusations of cultural appropriation by the footwear brand, with authorities saying this is not the first time traditional Mexican handicrafts have been copied. Citing these concerns, local authorities have asked Adidas to withdraw the shoe model.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday that Adidas was already in talks with authorities in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca to provide \u201ccompensation for the people who were plagiarized,\u201d and that her government was preparing legal reforms to prevent the copying of Mexican handicrafts.\nThe design at the center of the controversy is the \u201cOaxaca Slip-On,\u201d a sandal created by U.S. designer Willy Chavarr\u00eda for Adidas Originals. The sandals feature thin leather straps braided in a style that is unmistakably similar to the traditional Mexican huaraches. Instead of flat leather soles, the Adidas shoes tout a more chunky, sports shoe sole.\nAccording to Mexican authorities, Adidas\u2019 design contains elements that are part of the cultural heritage of the Zapotec Indigenous communities in Oaxaca, particularly in the town of Villa Hidalgo de Yal\u00e1lag. Handicrafts are a crucial economic lifeline in Mexico, providing jobs for around half a million people across the country. The industry accounts for around 10% of the gross domestic product of states like Oaxaca, Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero.\nFor Viridiana Jarqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda, a huaraches creator and vendor in Oaxaca\u2019s capital, the Adidas shoes were a \u201ccheap copy\u201d of the kind of work that Mexican artists take time and care to craft.\n\u201cThe artistry is being lost. We\u2019re losing our tradition,\u201d she said in front of her small booth of leather shoes.\nAuthorities in Oaxaca have called for the \u201cOaxaca Slip-On\u201d to be withdrawn and demanded a public apology from Adidas, with officials describing the design as \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d that may violate Mexican law.\nIn a public letter to Adidas leadership, Oaxaca state Gov. Salom\u00f3n Jara Cruz criticized the company\u2019s design, saying that \u201ccreative inspiration\u201d is not a valid justification for using cultural expressions that \u201cprovide identity to communities.\u201d\n\u201cCulture isn\u2019t sold, it\u2019s respected,\u201d he added.\nAdidas responded in a letter Friday afternoon, saying that the company \u201cdeeply values the cultural wealth of Mexico\u2019s Indigenous people and recognizes the relevance\u201d of the criticisms. It requested to sit down with local officials and to discuss how it can \u201crepair the damage\u201d to Indigenous populations.\nThe controversy follows years of efforts by Mexico\u2019s government and artisans to push back on major global clothing brands who they say copy traditional designs.\nIn 2021, the federal government asked manufacturers including Zara, Anthropologie and Patowl to provide a public explanation for why they copied clothing designs from Oaxaca\u2019s Indigenous communities to sell in their stores.\nNow, Mexican authorities say they\u2019re trying to work out stricter regulations in an effort to protect artists. But Marina N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Mexico\u2019s undersecretary of cultural development, noted that they also want to establish guidelines to not deprive artists of \u201cthe opportunity to trade or collaborate with several of these companies that have very broad commercial reach.\u201d\n____\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"
