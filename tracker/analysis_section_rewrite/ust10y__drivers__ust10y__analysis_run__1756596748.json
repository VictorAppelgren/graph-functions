      "feedback": "The draft is solid on the Fed‑equity link but drifts on a few points and lacks concrete, handle‑mapped signals. 1) **Remove or re‑anchor the sentence “A stronger dollar would dampen equity valuations, whereas a weaker dollar would lift them.”** It introduces a FX driver without a handle or catalyst; replace with a concise statement that the DXY is expected to fall 200 bp to 95.8 by Aug 31 (Z7O1DCHS7) and that this dovish move supports the equity upside. 2) **Add explicit magnitude ranges for the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread**: state that a 57 bp steepening (7XH2DKEKV) is the catalyst for a 25‑bp Fed cut, while a flattening below 30 bp would reduce the cut probability. 3) **Quantify the S&P impact by handle**: “If the Fed cuts 25 bp in September, spx will rise 3–5 % (B1KYJ1GPU)(3YAQ8JUPL); if rates stay high, spx will fall 5–10 % (FAN5RYW6T).” 4) **Tie the payroll catalyst window explicitly**: “September 5 payrolls are the key trigger; a slowdown (60 % prob.) pushes the Fed to cut, otherwise the Fed holds.” 5) **Add a brief risk‑inversion note**: “If inflation remains sticky (prob. 40 %), the Fed may raise rates, pushing spx down 5–10 %.” 6) **Ensure all claims have inline IDs**: e.g., the 200 bp DXY move (Z7O1DCHS7), the 25‑bp cut (XTQIQRP5K), the 15–20 bp 10‑yr compression (3YAQ8JUPL). 7) **Trim redundant sentences**: the paragraph on mortgage rates can be condensed to a single sentence linking ust10y to us_mortgage_rates (97MD1FHW8). 8) **Add a watch‑list**: July CPI/PCE, September payrolls, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, Fed minutes. 9) **Maintain focus on the asset**: keep all discussion tied to spx, ust10y, dxy, and the Fed policy handle. 10) **Remove any mention of “top‑ten tech names” unless you provide a handle (e.g., tech_sector) and a catalyst (earnings release).** After these edits, the view will meet the acceptance gate: it maps to spx, ust10y, dxy with explicit signs, ranges, and dated catalysts.",
