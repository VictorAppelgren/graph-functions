      "text": "A royal production indeed: Harry, Meghan make massive Netflix deal\n- Share via\nNetflix and ... Sussex?\nAs expected, Prince Harry and Meghan have officially gone Hollywood. The couple have signed a Netflix production deal less than a year after announcing their step back from royal duties in the United Kingdom, an endeavor that theoretically put them one step closer to the streamer\u2019s Emmy-winning royal drama \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\nFan-casting aside, the British prince and former actress will produce films and series for the streaming giant. That includes scripted series, docuseries, documentaries, features and children\u2019s programming, The Times confirmed Wednesday. The news comes after they were rumored to be shopping a TV series and making trademark moves in the industry.\nChilly sisters! Bad gifts! Sad nannies! \u201cFinding Freedom\u201d by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand delves into royal Brexit of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\u201cOur lives, both independent of each other, and as a couple have allowed us to understand the power of the human spirit: of courage, resilience and the need for connection,\u201d the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said in a statement to The Times. \u201cThrough our work with diverse communities and their environments, to shining a light on people and causes around the world, our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope. \u201c\nMore specifically, they\u2019ll focus on creating a wide range of programs about stories and issues that resonate with them personally, including highlighting issues that their nonprofit foundation, Archewell, is working on.\nHarry and Meghan, whose son, Archie, is 15 months old, added that making inspirational family programming is important to them as is \u201cpowerful storytelling through a truthful and relatable lens.\u201d They said that Netflix\u2019s reach will help them \u201cshare impactful content that unlocks action.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also committed to amplifying diverse voices in front of and behind the camera as well as diverse hiring practices for roles they\u2019re filling at their production company. Speculation about their production company has been swirling since January.\nNow settled in L.A., the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed with the Harry Walker Agency to book speaking engagements on health and social issues.\nThe royals turned producers have been unable to escape relentless press coverage since they began dating in 2016. They announced their departure from the British monarchy in January and a move to Los Angeles came soon after.\nMeghan, who starred in the USA series \u201cSuits,\u201d has no plans to return to acting. But her return to Tinseltown in other capacities was highly expected. In June, the pair signed on with the New York-based Harry Walker Agency for speaking engagements. They also relocated from England to Montecito, an affluent enclave in Santa Barbara County.\nThe Sussexes already have a few projects in development with Netflix, including a nature docuseries and an animated series that celebrates inspiring women. The prince also worked closely with filmmakers on \u201cRising Phoenix,\u201d a documentary that began streaming last week in which he also appears.\n\u201cHarry and Meghan have inspired millions of people all around the world with their authenticity, optimism and leadership,\u201d said Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive and chief content officer of Netflix, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly proud they have chosen Netflix as their creative home \u2014 and are excited about telling stories with them that can help build resilience and increase understanding for audiences everywhere.\u201d\nPrince Harry is calling on advertisers to seek change from social media platforms and heal the \u2018crisis of hate\u2019 they\u2019ve created."

      "text": "\u2018Wheel of Fortune,\u2019 \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 to stream on Hulu, Peacock\n- Share via\nThese long-running shows will no longer air only on TV stations.\nWhat are \u201cJeopardy!\u201d and \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d?\nBeginning this fall, the two shows will expand beyond their broadcast runs to streaming services Peacock and Hulu in the U.S., Sony Pictures Television announced Tuesday.\nFans still will be able to continue their routines by watching new episodes of the programs on their local stations.\nBut the new licensing agreements with Peacock, owned by NBCUniversal, and Hulu, owned by the Walt Disney Co., mark the first time current-season episodes also will be available on national streaming platforms the day after they debut on broadcast TV.\nThe move is a recognition by Sony that broadcast TV audiences are aging, and the studio must expand its reach to stay relevant with younger viewers. Until now, the game shows provided a bulwark for TV station operators struggling to hold onto viewers amid the flight to streaming. Stations were able to exclusively offer two of the most popular shows on television at a predictable time, drawing viewers to their evening lineups.\nNow that exclusivity is gone.\nThe syndicated game show, a staple of ABC\u2019s stations for decades, is one of the last great TV franchises standing.\nThe deals also will give Peacock and Hulu access to older episodes of the programs, enabling their viewers to binge on the brainteasers.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to bring America\u2019s favorite game shows to an even wider audience on Hulu, Hulu on Disney+, and Peacock,\u201d Keith Le Goy, chairman of Sony Pictures Television, said in a statement.\nAn appellate court said CBS could continue to deliver episodes of the popular game shows to television stations while the Paramount Global network appeals a lower court\u2019s ruling.\nSony owns the shows and produces them on its Culver City lot.\nThe shift comes as Sony continues to battle CBS over distribution rights to the two shows. In April, a Los Angeles judge ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, which has delivered batches of episodes to television stations around the country for decades.\nAfter that ruling, the Paramount Global-owned network appealed. A three-judge appellate panel paused the order and last week, the judges ruled that CBS could continue to distribute the shows during the appeals process.\nCBS maintains Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties.\nThe dispute burst into view when Sony terminated its distribution deal with CBS last August. It later filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit that claimed CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals for the shows and then paid itself a commission. Sony also maintained that rounds of budget cuts within CBS had hobbled the network\u2019s efforts to support the shows.\nSony claimed CBS licensed the shows to TV stations at below-market rates and failed to maximize advertising revenues.\nIn February, Sony attempted to cut CBS out of the picture, escalating the dispute.\nCBS was not involved in the streaming pacts announced Tuesday.\nHulu and Peacock will begin streaming the shows in September with the launch of the 42nd season of \u201cJeopardy\u201d and the 43rd season of \u201cWheel of Fortune.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018Sesame Street\u2019 moves to Netflix as streamer grows its preschool programming clout\n- Share via\nElmo, Big Bird and the rest of the Sesame Street gang are moving into the Netflix neighborhood.\nThe streaming service will premiere the beloved preschool program\u2019s 56th season, along with 90 hours of older episodes, later this year, the Los Gatos, Calif., entertainment company said Monday.\nThe move comes months after HBO\u2019s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, said it would no longer finance production of new episodes in a cost-cutting move. The decision, after a decade-long partnership, left the nonprofit Sesame Workshop searching for a lifeline.\nAs part of the Netflix deal, \u201cSesame Street\u201d will continue to air on PBS stations in the U.S. and will be available across the public broadcaster\u2019s digital platforms. PBS has been the broadcast partner since the puppets were pups back in 1969.\nThrough its deal with Sesame Workshop, Netflix will have exclusive worldwide premiere rights. Episodes will be available same-day on the PBS stations, providing a boost for the embattled broadcaster, which is trying to stave off a funding cut by Congress. President Trump has taken aim at the Corp. for Public Broadcasting, which steers grants to PBS and NPR, demanding the government cut the purse strings.\nPBS has a public service mandate. Providing commercial-free and educational children\u2019s programming has long supported that goal.\n\u201cThis unique public-private partnership will enable Sesame Workshop to bring our research-based curriculum to young children around the world with Netflix\u2019s global reach, while ensuring children in communities across the U.S. continue to have free access on public television to the Sesame Street they love,\u201d Sherrie Rollins Westin, chief executive of the nonprofit, said in a statement.\nLicensing terms were not disclosed.\nHBO threw \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 a lifeline a decade ago, enabling the production of new episodes. Warner Bros. Discovery has decided to stop financing first-run episodes after this season.\nNetflix said the new season, which will be released in three batches, will include some format changes and the return of popular segments such as \u201cElmo\u2019s World\u201d and \u201cCookie Monster\u2019s Foodie Truck.\u201d\nEpisodes will now be built around one 11-minute story, tailored to the shorter attention spans of younger viewers.\nThe partnership includes creating a new animated segment, \u201cTales from 123,\u201d in a nod to the famous 123 Sesame Street address. Fans will get to see inside the brick building that is home to Bert, Ernie and Cookie Monster. (It\u2019s not clear whether trash-can dwelling Oscar the Grouch has a bunk inside.)\nThe deal was a natural for Netflix, which has become a go-to streaming service with programming to serve nearly every audience.\nShows for preschoolers have become a particular sweet spot. Those titles include the popular \u201cPeppa Pig,\u201d \u201cCoComelon Lane,\u201d and \u201cMasha and the Bear.\u201d\nIt also has enjoyed success with \u201cMighty Little Bheem,\u201d an animated series from India, as well as its top preschool show, \u201cMs. Rachel,\u201d who first took off on YouTube teaching such skills as counting, nursery rhymes and phonics.\nThe streamer has expanded its repertoire at a time when legacy media companies have ceded a once lucrative space.\nNetflix on Wednesday said it is changing the look of its TV homepage and is experimenting with an artificial intelligence-powered search function.\nNetflix, in a statement, said kids and family programming now represents 15% of its total viewing.\nSuch programming has become a key part of the company\u2019s customer retention strategy, keeping parents with young children in the fold. Last week, Netflix told advertising buyers the streamer\u2019s ad-supported plan boasts more than 94 million global monthly active users.\nThe company plans to spend $18 billion on content this year.\nThe venerable children\u2019s TV series enters its 55th season Thursday during a time of change, but its mission to educate young viewers remains the same.\nAs part of the arrangement with Sesame Workshop, Netflix will be able to develop video games for both \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cSesame Street Mecha Builders.\u201d\nNetflix has debuted a \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d video game. During last month\u2019s earnings call, Netflix Co-CEO Greg Peters said the company wanted to offer kids-centric games \u2014 which is viewed as another potent vein.\nStaff writer Wendy Lee contributed to this report."

In 2019, previous corporate managers licensed \u201cSouth Park\u201d to rival HBO Max as Paramount\u2019s streaming service was still in development. But that decision left Paramount+ out in the cold \u2014 much like the fictional mountain town of South Park, Colo.\nThe HBO Max deal expired in late June.\nPark County \u2014 the business entity behind the long-running satirical cartoon \u2014 alleged that RedBird executive Jeff Shell crossed a line by interfering with its negotiations with other companies. A representative for Shell denied the accusation.\nParamount this spring offered HBO Max and its parent, Warner Bros. Discovery, an option to co-license the show, which would have given Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Cartman a home on two streaming services: Paramount+ and HBO Max.\nBut over the weekend and on Monday, the talks with Warner Bros. Discovery collapsed, prompting Paramount to go it alone, according to one of the knowledgeable sources.\nHarry and Meghan aren\u2019t the only people mad at the long-running satirical cartoon.\nBoth sides were motivated to reach a deal before Wednesday, when Paramount\u2019s Comedy Central channel kicks off the 27th season of \u201cSouth Park.\u201d The premiere date had already been postponed once amid behind-the-scenes drama as Paramount prepares to be sold to David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media.\nParamount and Skydance also wanted to avoid any public relations fiascoes when Stone and Parker take the stage Thursday at fan-fest Comic-Con in San Diego.\nThanks to an arrangement dating back to 2007, Park County is entitled to nearly half of the show\u2019s streaming revenue through a joint venture with Paramount called South Park Digital Studios. The revenue sharing arrangement should enable Paramount to eventually recoup about half of the licensing fee that it agreed to pay for streaming rights.\nParamount wants to secure the rights to stream \u2018South Park,\u2019 but the deal still hasn\u2019t come to fruition as the Skydance deal is still in limbo.\nMonths of deal talks were complicated by Paramount\u2019s pending sale to Skydance.\nIn addition, the two sides have separately been negotiating a new overall deal for Parker and Stone, to renew their previous $900 million pact that kept the show on Comedy Central with new episodes through 2027.\nParker and Stone\u2019s team are seeking a higher valuation in order to produce new seasons.\nSkydance has the authority to approve major Paramount transactions, as part of an arrangement it struck last year with the company\u2019s board.\nInitially, Park County asked for a 10-year deal but Skydance balked, insisting on a shorter span given the uncertain television landscape.\nThe high-stakes negotiations became strained last week, prompting Park County to enlist bulldog litigators Stuart Liner and Bryan Freedman to prepare a lawsuit targeting Paramount and Skydance, two sources said.\nBut, by week\u2019s end, the talks were back on track. The various sides agreed on a five-year term rather than a 10-year span.\nSkydance signed off on the transaction, the sources said.\nThe high-stakes deal that came together this week resulted from months of back-and-forth among a constellation of power players with competing interests, including the president, the Larry Ellison family and mogul Shari Redstone.\nParker and Stone\u2019s longtime attorney, Kevin Morris, and Keith Pizzi, Park County\u2019s Chief Executive, spearheaded negotiations for the creators. Keyes Hill-Edgar, chief operating officer of Paramount\u2019s media networks unit, shepherded Paramount\u2019s side.\nSkydance\u2019s Ellison and Jeff Shell, a senior executive at RedBird Capital Partners, which is part of the Skydance team, were heavily involved in the negotiations to bring the show to Paramount+.\nThe companies declined to comment Monday."
