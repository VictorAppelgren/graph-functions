And, like, I fly off the cuff in not like a violent way, obviously,\u201d she laughed, adding that \u201cIf I feel something, I am going to say it. Sometimes it gets me into trouble.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s always devil\u2019s advocate as much as it literally kills me. He\u2019s so thoughtful in his decisions. He\u2019s the most ethical human on this entire planet. Every single decision he makes is based on his code of ethics,\u201d she added in the over-the-top tribute.\nAs she continued to heap praise on her partner, the mom reflected on the life lessons he had taught her, including how to ask for help and the importance of being vulnerable.\n\u201cI think one of the things I\u2019m going to miss is being able to show him how wonderful he\u2019s been to me and he can enjoy that. I think that bums me out,\u201d she said in the video.\nEmily said she was heartbroken at the thought she\u2019d no longer be able to trade bizarre stories and have him roast her.\n\u201cThere is no point to this video except to say like, yes, I feel sorry for myself and I\u2019m scared about how my life is going to change and how hard it is going to be for me,\u201d she said in the clip.\n\u201cBut I know how truly at the end of the day I am just so scared that all these wonderful things from this phenomenally perfect man, who has given me more than I can ever thank him for, might not be here to see all that.\u201d\nThe video was among a slew of TikToks she posted in the months leading up to Monday\u2019s shocking murder-suicide that shed light on her declining mental state \u2014 including one where she even admitted she needed professional help.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear exactly when Long posted the seven-minute clip, which has since been reposted by other users.\nThe harrowing details continued to emerge just days after investigators said she shot her husband and her two eldest children \u2014 Parker, 8, and Ryan, 6 \u2014 before taking her own life at their Madbury, New Hampshire, home early Monday.\nThe couple\u2019s 3-year-old child \u2014 the lone survivor of the slaughter \u2014 was found alive and unharmed inside the house.\nThe mom\u2019s death was ruled a suicide while her family members\u2019 deaths were ruled homicides, according to the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office.\nInvestigators haven\u2019t yet revealed a motive for the tragedy.\n\u201cWhile investigators are becoming aware of various concerns/issues ongoing in the household at the time of the event in question, people should avoid speculating that this event was caused by a single reason or stressor,\u201d the AG\u2019s office said in a statement."

      "text": "Ex-Adams adviser Winnie Greco claims cash-stuffed chip bag she gave to NYC reporter was \u2018birthday gift\u2019\nWinnie Greco, the ex-adviser to Mayor Eric Adams who handed a reporter a cash-stuffed potato chip bag, bizarrely claimed Friday that the controversial packet was her \u201cbirthday gift\u201d and implied that the journalist she slipped the money to wanted to \u201churt her.\u201d\nGreco, when reached by The Post heading to her car in The Bronx, launched into the baffling explanation for giving the bag to THE CITY reporter Katie Honan on Wednesday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have purpose, and I treat people everyone is the same,\u201d Greco said. \u201cIt\u2019s angel, OK, but if somebody want to hurt me because I have love to my community, and I have love to the world, to my family, my people, and somebody try to hurt me, I cannot say nothing.\u201d\nGreco said she didn\u2019t even know how much cash was in the red envelope found inside the Herr\u2019s chips bag \u2014 which her attorney said contained $300 in cash \u2014 because it was \u201cmy birthday gift.\u201d\n\u201cBefore I didn\u2019t know how much in my envelope because it\u2019s my birthday gift that\u2019s Chinese culture,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody give me my birthday gift, I made big mistake I\u2019m so sorry. Talk to my lawyer.\u201d\nShe also double downed when The Post asked her to clarify if she really meant to say Honan wanted to \u201churt\u201d her.\n\u201cYes. Talk to my lawyer,\u201d she said.\nThe money-filled sour cream and onion ripple potato chip bag was widely seen as a failed bribe or payoff.\nGreco and her attorney had previously defended the gift by contending it was part of Chinese culture to present cash to friends.\nBut Greco, who resigned from her City Hall position under a cloud of scrutiny, has apparently changed her tune to sound more like \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d A source said Greco\u2019s birthday is August 4, while Honan\u2019s is in November.\n\u201cI can\u2019t comment on the source of the money,\u201d said Greco\u2019s attorney Steven Brill, adding it was meant as a kind gesture, not as anything nefarious.\nHonan told The Post she wasn\u2019t working on a story related to Greco before the bizarre \u201cgift.\u201d\nGreco resigned in October from her post as Adams\u2019 director of Asian community affairs \u2014 after she was targeted in multiple investigations \u2014 and has long been under scrutiny for ties to Chinese nationals.\nNeither Adams nor his campaign are implicated in the chip saga. Greco\u2019s volunteer status with the mayor\u2019s re-election bid was suspended after THE CITY wrote about the cash gift earlier this week, campaign spokesman Todd Shapiro has said.\nTHE CITY said it reported the incident to the city Department of Investigation."

Last year, her dealer, Jaquan Casserly, was sentenced to 10 years after he pleaded guilty to felony drug sale.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra was found unconscious aboard a boat named Ripple at the ritzy yacht club around midnight. The vessel is one of at least two Grateful Dead-themed 54-foot Sea Ray craft owned by insurance mogul Christopher Durnan, sources previously told The Post.\nHomicide detectives are waiting on additional toxicology test results before releasing an official cause of death for Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra. A final report is expected back \u201cby . . . early next month, at the latest,\u201d said one source.\nArthur Aidala, the lawyer for Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s family, did not return a call for comment."

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be deported after refusing plea offer\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing.\nThe Costa Rica offer came late Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadoran national would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day. Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.\nHis attorneys declined to comment on whether the plea offer had been formally rescinded. The brief they filed only said that Abrego Garcia had declined one part of the offer \u2014 to remain in jail \u2014 and that his attorneys would \u201ccommunicate the government\u2019s proposal to Mr. Abrego.\u201d\nFiled along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn\u2019t face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia\u2019s native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\n\u201cThe government immediately responded to Mr. Abrego\u2019s release with outrage,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cDespite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego\u2019s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE\u2019s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,\u201d it says, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nStay up to date on alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia\n- Trump admin plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia after prison release \u2013 and not to El Salvador, prosecutor tells judge\n- Kilmar Abrego Garcia back in US to face charges of trafficking thousands of illegal migrants \u2014 including MS-13 gangbangers\n- Moment alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia was accused of human trafficking revealed in new bodycam video\n- Alleged MS-13 gangbanger\u2019s rank, street name revealed as fight over deportation to El Salvador megaprison rages: docs\n- Supreme Court rules Trump admin must \u2018facilitate\u2019 return of wrongfully deported Maryland man\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\nA Department of Homeland Security agent testified that he didn\u2019t begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\nAlthough Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours\u2019 notice before initiating deportation proceedings \u2014 time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.\n\u201cPlease let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),\u201d it states.\nFederal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador where he faces a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of violence, according to court filings."

      "text": "Rival candidates lined up to roast Mayor Eric Adams in the wake of a new bribery indictment of his close longtime advisor and the news that a campaign confidante had handed a reporter for THE CITY cash stuffed inside a potato chip bag.\nAndrew Cuomo, who, like Adams, is running as an independent after a humbling loss in the Democratic primary to socialist Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, handed out bags of chips to reporters at a campaign event where he called Chipgate \u201cembarassing.\u201d\nJim Walden, a former federal prosecutor also running as an independent, reupped his call for a citywide department of public integrity.\nAnd Curtis Sliwa \u2014 the Guardian Angels founder again running on the Republican line four years after he was handily defeated by then-Democrat Adams \u2014 said he had predicted the corruption of the mayor \u201cand his cronies\u201d years ago.\n\u201cNow the chickens have come home to roost a second time on the cusp of a new election,\u201d he said. \u201cIngrid, his political soul mate, was indicted again, and Winnie Greco [gave] out a bag of potato chips stuffed with money. Old habits die hard.\u201d\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Thursday charged Ingrid Lewis-Martin, Adams\u2019 close advisor who wielded significant influence at City Hall, alleging cash-for-favors exchanges. Also hit with conspiracy, bribery and other charges were Lewis-Martin\u2019s son; Jesse Hamilton, another close associate of Adams whom the mayor put in charge of city leases; a businessman, a developer, and the co-owners of a film and TV production company.\nLewis-Martin abruptly resigned last year in the wake of a previous indictment from Bragg on similar charges related to alleged influence-peddling.\nThe new charges against Lewis-Martin came a day after Winnie Greco, a former top City Hall advisor who was working as a volunteer for Adams\u2019 reelection campaign, handed Katie Honan, a reporter from THE CITY, a small bag containing some sour cream & onion chips. The bag, Honan soon discovered, also contained a red envelope and an unknown amount of cash. Honan attempted to return it but could not reach Greco, who later apologized.\nGreco was a target of multiple law enforcement investigations over the past few years, and THE CITY has reported extensively on her dealings.\nAfter Greco gave Honan the money-stuffed bag of Herr\u2019s Sour Cream & Onion ripple potato chips, the Adams campaign suspended Greco from the campaign. THE CITY gave the chip bag and money to federal law enforcement, which has not reported back the amount of money the envelope contained.\nBob Clark, vice president of marketing for Herr Foods, Inc., said the company was surprised to see its chips mentioned in the press.\n\u201cWhile we can\u2019t speak to the details of the story,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can confirm that our Sour Cream & Onion flavor is money.\u201d\nHonan\u2019s encounter with the chip-accessorized red gift envelope quickly blew up into a viral news story, inspiring jokes, memes and even a low-res video game.\nMeanwhile, New York Democratic Socialists of America and New Yorkers for Lower Costs, an independent committee supporting Mamdani, sent themed fundraising appeals to supporters.\n\u201cIf you want to support Zohran Mamdani for Mayor, you can chip in,\u201d an email read. \u201cLet\u2019s put the Adams era in the trash bin where it belongs.\u201d\nIn a statement, Mamdani, who\u2019s notably avoided the chip jokes so far, focused on the indictment as a way to highlight contrasts between himself and the sitting mayor.\n\u201cCorruption isn\u2019t just about what a politician gains, it\u2019s about what the public loses,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, New Yorkers are paying the price as another flurry of indictments continue to erode their trust in our democracy and distract from the affordability crisis that demands action and urgency.\u201d\nCuomo, who resigned from Albany after multiple accusations of sexual harassment, said the latest indictment showed why people don\u2019t believe in government.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the opposite of what government should be, and it has been going on for the duration of the Adams administration, and that\u2019s before you get to the mayor himself,\u201d he said at an event in Midtown Manhattan Thursday.\n\u201cI believe this is a race between myself and the assemblyman. I think that was the case, and I think it\u2019s more clearly the case,\u201d he added, saying the mayor was not a \u201cviable candidate.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Adams\u2019 campaign, Todd Shapiro, emphasized that the mayor has \u201cnot been accused of wrongdoing\u201d and that he continues to focus on the city.\n\u201cWhile Ingrid Lewis-Martin no longer works for this administration, she has been a friend and colleague of the mayor for over 40 years, and he knows her as a devoted public servant; she has declared her innocence, and his prayers are with her and her family,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cMayor Adams also recognizes that Jesse Hamilton has pleaded not guilty, and like anyone accused, he is entitled to the presumption of innocence.\u201d\nHamilton resigned Thursday, according to City Hall.\nAdams himself and other associates of his administration have been mired in scandals. The mayor had been charged with bribery, wire fraud and receiving donations from foreign nationals \u2014 but federal prosecutors moved to drop the charges after President Donald Trump took office.\nA new poll of 638 likely voters released Thursday by American Pulse Research showed Mamdani in a comfortable lead, with nearly 37% supporting, compared to Cuomo at 24.6%, Sliwa at 16.8% and Adams at 11.4%.\nJasmine Gripper, co-director of the New York Working Families Party, which backs Mamdani, said New Yorkers deserve better than Adams and Cuomo.\n\u201cIn this moment, we don\u2019t need to replace one scandal-ridden politician with another scandal-ridden politician,\u201d she said, \u201cNew Yorkers deserve to leave this decades-old, corruption-filled legacy behind and move forward with leaders who are ready to lead with integrity and justice and a moral compass.\u201d"

      "text": "Top Eric Adams adviser Winnie Greco caught handing reporter a bag of chips stuffed with cash\nA former top aide to Mayor Eric Adams \u2014 and current adviser to his re-election campaign \u2014 handed a Big Apple reporter a potato chip bag stuffed with cash Wednesday, according to a report and sources.\nWinnie Greco gave the bag to Katie Honan, a reporter at The City, just steps away from Hizonner\u2019s new campaign office in Harlem, The Post confirmed.\nNeither Adams nor his re-election campaign are implicated in the incident.\nGreco, 62, ran into Honan outside the Harlem campaign office, and the reporter later received a text asking her to meet across the street at a nearby TD Bank, according to the report.\nHonan met Greco at the bank, then was brought to a nearby Whole Foods, where Greco handed her a crumpled bag of Herr\u2019s sour cream and onion rippled potato chips.\nThinking she was being offered a snack, Honan told Greco more than once that she could not accept the chips, but Greco insisted, according to the report.\nAfter the two parted ways, Honan opened the bag and discovered a red envelope containing at least one $100 bill and several $20 bills, The City reported.\nThe outlet referred to the exchange as a \u201cfailed payoff,\u201d but Greco claimed that she \u201caccidentally\u201d handed the reporter the cash, according to sources.\nIn comments to The City on Wednesday evening, Greco apologized for the supposed mix-up.\n\u201cI make a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s a culture thing. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m so sorry. I feel so bad right now. I\u2019m so sorry, honey,\u201d Greco told The City.\nAfter an initial interview with the outlet, Greco called back with an attorney present, the report stated.\n\u201cCan we forget about this? I try to be a good person. Please. Please. Please don\u2019t do in the news nothing about me.\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted to be her friend,\u201d Greco said, adding, \u201cI just wanted to have one good friend. It\u2019s nothing,\u201d she told the outlet.\nAttorney Steven Brill further claimed that Greco was \u201cpurely innocent\u201d and chalked the incident up to a misunderstanding based on cultural differences.\n\u201cI can see how this looks strange,\u201d Brill told The City. \u201cBut I assure you that Winnie\u2019s intent was purely innocent. In the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude.\u201d\n\u201cWinnie is apologetic and embarrassed by any negative impression or confusion that may have caused,\u201d Brill concluded.\nGreco\u2019s volunteer status with the mayor\u2019s re-election bid was immediately suspended, the campaign told The Post.\n\u201cWe are shocked by these reports. Winnie Greco holds no position in this campaign and has been suspended from all VOLUNTEER campaign-related activities. Mayor Adams had no prior knowledge of this matter,\u201d spokesperson Todd Shapiro said.\n\u201cHe has always demanded the highest ethical and legal standards, and his sole focus remains on serving the people of New York City with integrity.\n\u201cWe are shocked by these reports,\u201d he added.\nThe City reported the incident to the Department of Investigation.\n\u201cDOI received allegations from The City and declines further comment,\u201d agency spokesperson Diane Struzzi told the outlet.\nGreco, a former Asian affairs adviser under Adams, resigned in October 2024, with speculation swirling that the one-time trusted aide could be indicted by the feds.\nHer Bronx home was raided in February that year after she faced a probe by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation over allegations that she improperly used her position to get perks.\nSince the high-profile investigations, Greco had seemed to disappear from New York City for several months but became a constant presence on the campaign in recent weeks, The City reported.\nThe shocking chip-handoff revelation came just hours after The Post reported longtime Adams confidant Ingrid Lewis-Martin is expected to face even more corruption charges for allegedly accepting handouts in exchange for political favors.\nThe details on the incoming indictment were not immediately clear, but sources believe it is connected to the McGuinness Boulevard revamp in Greenpoint, Brooklyn."

  "argos_summary": "Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani launched a citywide scavenger hunt that riffs on the recent \u2018chipgate\u2019 scandal, where former Adams adviser Winnie Greco handed a reporter a bag of potato chips stuffed with cash. Greco\u2019s gesture, which has sparked federal investigations and a suspension from the mayor\u2019s campaign, is mirrored by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s own chip giveaways, fueling a broader narrative of corruption in New\u202fYork City politics. The article also touches on unrelated incidents\u2014a New\u202fHampshire mother\u2019s tragic murder\u2011suicide, a Long Island drug\u2011dealer probe, and the planned deportation of alleged smuggler Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2014illustrating a range of high\u2011profile legal and political controversies.",
