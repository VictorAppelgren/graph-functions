  "content": "US stocks climbed on Wednesday amid increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting, following the latest inflation data.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose nearly 0.5%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also climbed roughly 0.5%.\n\nStocks roared on Tuesday after the release of the July CPI report, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both touching new records. Though the data showed inflation had ticked up, it increased by less than expected.\n\nThe results boosted bets the Fed would cut interest rates at its September policy meeting, especially in light of recent warnings signs the labor market is weakening. On Wednesday morning, traders had priced in a nearly 100% chance of a September cut, according to the CME Group.\n\nLater this week, investors will get two more snapshots on the state of the economy with the release of the Producer Price Index on Thursday and retail sales data on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, Circle (CRCL) fell Wednesday after the company announced it would sell 10 million shares on the heels of its first earnings report since its explosive public debut. Cava (CAVA) shares also dove after the company issued its first annual sales growth target cut. CoreWeave (CRWV) posted losses at the open as the company's operating income guidance fell below expectations as its cost of debt mounts, despite beating revenue estimates on strong demand for AI.\n\nLooking ahead, Cisco (CSCO) is Wednesday's earnings headliner after the closing bell.",

      "text": "In this article:\nBy Juveria Tabassum\n(Reuters) -Shares of Cava (CAVA) dropped 22% before the bell on Wednesday, after the Mediterranean restaurant chain lowered its annual same-store sales growth target for the first time since it listed on the New York Stock Exchange two years ago.\nAn uncertain macroeconomic environment has forced consumers to opt for more affordable meals at home, dampening demand for dining out over the last several months, impacting the results of other restaurant chains, including burrito giant Chipotle Mexican Grill and salad-focused Sweetgreen.\nCava had reported a double-digit rise in same-store sales for the last four quarters, helped by demand for its pita wraps and salad bowls. However, customer traffic remained almost flat in the second quarter, with its same-store sales rising 2.1%, below estimates of 6.47%, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nCava now expects full-year same-restaurant sales growth between 4% and 6%, compared with its prior target of 6% to 8%.\nConsumers were less confident than they were a year ago as economic uncertainties weighed, which led to weaker traffic in June and early July, but visits have improved since, said Brett Schulman, Cava's co-founder and CEO.\nCava is opening more stores to capitalize on the resilient demand for its menu items and has raised its target for annual new restaurant openings to a range of 68 to 70, from 64 to 68 expected earlier.\nIt also maintained targets for annual profit margin and core profit.\nThe company does not plan to increase prices and would try to absorb any inflationary costs from tariffs, Schulman added.\n\"As we've seen the last few weeks, I don't know that these recent announcements (on tariffs) will be the same announcements in a couple of weeks. So we're staying nimble,\" he said.\nThe company reported a profit of 16 cents per share for the quarter ended July 13, compared with estimates of 13 cents apiece.\nAs of last close, Cava's shares have more than doubled to $84.50 since its blockbuster IPO in June 2023.\n(Reporting by Juveria Tabassum in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)"

      "text": "Inflation remained sticky in July, according to new government data released Tuesday, as investors stay alert to how much President Trump\u2019s tariffs are starting to affect consumer costs.\nThe latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that \"core\" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.3% over the past month, surpassing June's 0.2% uptick and marking the largest gain in six months.\nAnnual core prices rose 3.1% in July, up from June\u2019s 2.9% year-over-year increase, signaling that rising goods inflation is no longer being offset by easing services inflation. Core services prices also firmed, with shelter rising 0.2% for the second consecutive month, while transportation services and medical care services each climbed 0.8%, up from respective gains of 0.2% and 0.6% in June.\nRead more: July CPI breakdown: Consumers feel the crunch of accelerating inflation\nHeading into the report, economists expected the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) to rise 3% year over year and 0.3% month over month.\nOn a headline basis, CPI increased 2.7% on an annual basis in July, matching June's number and slower than economists' expectations of a 2.8% rise.\nMonth over month, prices rose 0.2% compared to June's 0.3% increase, on par with economists' estimates. The monthly drop was driven by lower gasoline prices and moderately softer food inflation.\n\"Although core annual inflation is back to its highest level since February, today\u2019s CPI print is not hot enough to derail the Fed from cutting rates in September,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in reaction to the report.\nShah noted some evidence of tariff-related pass-through to consumers, though not yet at a level that \"rings alarm bells.\" One example: Footwear prices jumped 1.4% in July from the prior month \u2014 the largest monthly increase since April 2021.\nOther categories seeing increases included furniture and bedding, recreation, household furnishings and operations, and used cars and trucks. Airline fares jumped 4% after a 0.1% decline in June, while lodging away from home and communication were among the few major indexes to fall last month, according to the BLS.\nTuesday's report arrives amid ongoing trade developments that could further alter the US effective tariff rate, now hovering near 18.6% \u2014 the highest since 1933, according to the latest Yale Budget Lab estimate.\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nThe back-and-forth raises fresh questions about the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting path."

      "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks have gained ground in recent months despite a lack of major catalysts, with ample domestic liquidity likely to sustain the rally.\nMainland households, flushed with record-high savings, are turning to equities for better returns as interest rates continue to drift lower. The amount of margin loans taken out to buy stocks climbed to the highest level since 2015 this week. The momentum is also seen in the monthly average turnover on onshore exchanges, which is on track for a third month of advances.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nSunseeking Germans Face Swiss Backlash Over Alpine Holiday Congestion\n-\nTo Head Off Severe Storm Surges, Nova Scotia Invests in \u2018Living Shorelines\u2019\n-\nNew York Warns of $34 Billion Budget Hole, Biggest Since 2009 Crisis\n-\nFive Years After Black Lives Matter, Brussels\u2019 Colonial Statues Remain\n-\nFor Homeless Cyclists, Bikes Bring an Escape From the Streets\nThat\u2019s pushed up the benchmark CSI 300 Index 16% from its April low, following months of range-bound trading. While Beijing hasn\u2019t announced any major stimulus or finalized a trade deal with the US, markets have reacted positively to recent moves to curb excessive price wars and overcapacity in some sectors. These steps are seen by investors as a way to ease deflation and boost corporate earnings, which could provide further support to the market gains.\n\u201cFunds with a high risk appetite are gradually increasing their allocations to stocks, against the backdrop of low interest rates, a lack of good investment options and a surplus of liquidity,\u201d said Fu Zhifeng, chief investment officer at Shanghai Chengzhou Investment Management Co. \u201cThe trend has just started building momentum and I don\u2019t see any signals for it to reverse anytime soon.\u201d\nA gauge of onshore-listed small-cap stocks, long favored by individual investors, has surged to an eight-year high.

Solid. Not super perfect.\nThis is how we roll at Yahoo Finance for our giant community....everyday serving up that craveable unbeatable context! \ud83d\udcaa\nLet's turn now to our stock of the day. Today it's all about Core Weave Momo AI trade. Core Weave will report earnings after the close. Today stock is increased almost four times from its late March IPO price. Here's I think the Street is looking for from core we've if it could hit these marks, the stock could renew its upward bias that has been on delay since early June. 1. Revenue has to beat estimates by double digit percentage. Key core we've customer Microsoft had a huge quarter on the AI use front, so core weave should have theoretically benefited. 2, backlog needs to have increased. Compared to the first quarter, 3 earnings need to thump estimates. I've heard some concerns on how core weaves earnings come in or could come in given robust investments in CapEx and for management. Tamps down concerns on how how much stock could be sold by insiders later this week. Core weave has an expiring IPO lockup that frees up 83% of Class A shares beginning the morning of August 15th, points out City. If a lot of core we've stock is dumped, it could weigh on the market price in the near term. Corey's valuation leaves no margin for error. Stock trades at big time premiums to the broader market. Still with me my roundtable Jim Bianco, Bianco Research President and you'll find senior reporters Brooke De Palma and as Foray. Brooke, I wanna go over to you because you've been examining how core we've essentially ties in with Microsoft. Yeah, absolutely. What we do know is that Microsoft is one of Corey's biggest companies. And if you take a look, not only is Microsoft one of their biggest companies, but we also know that IBM, Meta, those are additional companies that of Core we've worked with in order to supply or their servers and for these big AI semiconductors. And so it's important to know too that Invidia also is a partner with Core. We've we know that Core we've rents out computer servers quit by a video and a video also. Has a stake within the company. And so it's been interesting to watch this stock movement over the past month. Right now, what we've seen is core, we've seen about a 8% jump as these companies have reported their earnings and reported that their cloud businesses have outperformed expectations. And NVIDIA is about a 10% jump over the last month. But as you said, this stock is up more than 240% since the IPO. And so definitely trading at a premium here. But what we do know is that based on its S1. Filings these are key players in the game right now when it comes to the AI revolution and so core we've certainly benefiting from having a part in that it is I always get a little nervous ahead of an earnings report where so many things appear to be going right sentiment on the AI trade is good Microsoft performed well Google crush it the stage theoretically is set for core we've but I did call out some concern how their earnings may come out because of investments they're. Yeah, that's right. So that's one of the concerns that the Street has. And also that lockup period that you just mentioned that could cause some volatility. But you do have Wall Street analysts, some of them saying, look, this stock can absorb this. So even if you do see selling after that lockup period expires this week, then you you would see the stock sort of absorbing this. As you mentioned, it has had quite a run and it really underscores what the market has been leaning towards, the fact that you have AI that it's looking forward to. So what Wall Street has been talking about throughout this entire time, when we've seen these tariffs being rolled out in this uncertainty over what's happening at the Fed, they are expecting a cut and they're expecting AI to move this market forward. Jim, real quick over to, you know, this has been another core. We've really one of the hottest IPOs of the year. You have Figma, Firefly last week. What do you attribute some of these early gains for these IPOs? You know, I wrote over the weekend in our Morning Brief newsletter, I think it reflects. More mature companies coming to market but would love your take. Yeah, I think it also reflects the the hope and maybe the hype of AI and that AI could count me in on, you know, those that think it's gonna be bigger than the Internet itself was in the late 90s, early 2000s, once it achieves its potential. But the big thing you got to keep in mind with company like Core, Weaver, Invidia or the rest of them is they're all customers of each other. Because we're still at the picks and shovels play. We're still at the Let's make a I play. We're not at the What is Ford doing with AI to change its bottom line? Or what is Procter and Gamble doing with AI to change its bottom line? Or what am I doing with AI to change the bottom line? We're using a little bit of it like the rest of them, but it's not changing our bottom line. So it reminds me of that old Bill Gates line. That technology over the next three years will underwhelm what you think it's going to do. And over the next 10 years, it's going to overwhelm what you think it's going to do. And if it underwhelms what these valuations in this hype, we might be seeing a little bit of disappointment somewhere down the road. Jim, I wonder how Fed chair. Bill Pulte would use AI. No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding, Jim. You know, just keeping the the mood light on this Tuesday morning. Alright, let's fire up our question of the day. Is it the cut rates to 1%? Yeah, No. Fair enough. See, I knew you would tie all this together. Jim. I appreciate you, man."

      "text": "In this article:\n(Bloomberg) -- The caution flags have been waving for weeks: The record run in US stocks is masking trouble beneath the surface.\nNow, signs are emerging that investors have started to heed the warnings.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nSunseeking Germans Face Swiss Backlash Over Alpine Holiday Congestion\n-\nTo Head Off Severe Storm Surges, Nova Scotia Invests in \u2018Living Shorelines\u2019\n-\nNew York Warns of $34 Billion Budget Hole, Biggest Since 2009 Crisis\n-\nFive Years After Black Lives Matter, Brussels\u2019 Colonial Statues Remain\n-\nFor Homeless Cyclists, Bikes Bring an Escape From the Streets\nA Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of S&P 500 companies with the strongest balance sheets just posted the best week since early April relative to a basket of firms with weaker finances. The cash-rich companies, including the likes of Fastenal Co., Palantir Technologies Inc. and West Pharmaceutical Services Inc., have gained for three straight weeks, the longest run since Donald Trump\u2019s initial tariff announcement sent markets into a tailspin.\nThe rotation lets traders who are growing anxious about the market\u2019s three-month surge stay invested while trimming some exposure to more vulnerable companies. Buying shares of firms that have the financial wherewithal to withstand a slowing economy and the threat of margin compression from tariffs could limit downside exposure if the S&P 500\u2019s run begins to falter.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been sensing that investors, while riding the rally higher, they\u2019re getting nervous,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \u201cA little caution is warranted\u201d in the current market, he said.\nThe S&P 500 has surged 29% since a low on April 8, closing at a record on Tuesday. Much of the rally owes to artificial intelligence euphoria that\u2019s powered Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to multi-trillion dollar valuations. Solid corporate earnings bolstered optimism that Trump\u2019s chaotic trade policies haven\u2019t caused the damage expected. But most of the profit growth was clustered in tech and tech-adjacent sectors, papering over weakness among purveyors of consumer products and makers of industrial equipment.\nAs a consequence, Citigroup Inc. strategists noted \u201cearly\u201d signs of a rebound in value factors from July into early August as investors sought companies whose shares were underpriced relative to financial fundamentals. That has meant losses for profitless tech companies and other speculative plays.\nHigher quality, defensive names have \u201cheld their own,\u201d said Colin Cieszynski, portfolio manager and chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. Telecommunication companies, utilities and insurance firms have performed well, along with the tech behemoths, he said. Other strong defensive performers include tobacco producer Philip Morris International Inc., which is up 40% in 2025."

      "text": "A fresh reading on inflation showed prices for a smattering of goods and services moved higher for Americans in July, creating a dilemma for the Federal Reserve on whether to hold interest rates steady in September.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July showed prices, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.1% year over year. That was hotter than the 3% economists expected and up from 2.9% in June, when inflation was pushed higher by rising goods prices. Month-over-month CPI clocked in as expected, rising 0.3%.\nOn a headline basis, however, CPI rose less than expected \u2014 by 2.7%, a tenth lower than expectations for a rise of 2.8%.\nMarkets, meanwhile, are pricing in a 92% chance the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points in September.\n\"There was another narrative shift for the Fed to contend with in the July CPI data, with tariff effects once again barely perceptible, but a stronger gain in services prices pointing to another above-target gain in the core PCE deflator last month,\" Capital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown said.\nBut Brown noted that, given that several Fed members are now more worried about the job market outlook, this inflation report probably won't be enough to prevent the Fed from cutting rates sooner than he previously expected.\n\"But it does support our view that markets are overestimating the degree of loosening to come over the next 18 months,\" he said.\nThe Fed has been largely in a \"wait and see\" mode, as many central bankers want to assess the impact of tariffs on inflation.\nFed Chair Powell has said he wants to see the impact of tariffs on inflation over the months of June, July, and August, though he's coming around to the idea that their impact may be no more than a one-time increase in prices. But as the Fed waits to see whether or not tariffs will lead to persistent inflation, July's inflation data didn't offer any decisive findings, with some areas of goods inflation like furniture and shoes perking up, but services inflation, which historically has been the stickier culprit, popping back up.\nInflation now stands more than a full percentage point above the Fed's 2% target.\n\"This month's report did nothing to convince anyone,\" Northlight Asset Management chief investment officer Chris Zaccarelli said.\nIn the wake of the inflation numbers, President Trump again called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates now, saying on social media that consumers aren\u2019t paying tariffs and that it\u2019s mostly companies and foreign governments.\n\u201cJerome \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell must NOW lower the rate,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cThe damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we\u2019ve blown through Powell and the complacent Board.\u201d\nIn the wake of disagreement on interest rate levels, the president also said he is considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the \u201chorrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.\u201d\nJoe Lavorgna, council to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, notes that core goods prices are up just 0.8% since the tariffs were implemented in February and that headline inflation measured by CPI has been soft over the past three months.\n\u201cThere's been no inflation at all where people thought it would show up, and I think that's very encouraging, and you overlay that with what's happening on shelter and those that think you have to look at the core rate that\u2019s going to move down quite sharply,\u201d Lavorgna said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nThe inflation data come after a government report showed the US economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate moved up to 4.2% from 4.1% the month prior. At the same time, the two prior months saw downward revisions. May's job gains were revised down to 19,000 from 144,000, while June's additions were cut to just 14,000 from the 147,000 initially reported. That pulled the three-month average employment gain down to 35,000 \u2014 a figure many analysts are interpreting as a sign that hiring is stalling, even as population growth slows.\nLavorgna also thinks that job growth will rebound later this year as firms have gotten more certainty on tax policy.\n\u201cI would expect now, as companies are going to watch-and-see mode, that you're going to start to see hiring pick up quite significantly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just a matter of time before you're going to see really big improvements in demand for labor, especially now that the tax policy is clarified. Companies made a commitment to capital, now they're going to make the commitment to labor.\u201d\nStill, the data is likely to lead to continued division within the central bank over whether to cut rates in September at this juncture.\nKansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid said Tuesday that inflation remains too high and that he favors a \u201cpatient approach\u201d to cutting rates.\n\u201cWhile increased tariffs seem to be having a limited effect on inflation, I view this as a rationale for keeping policy on hold rather than an opportunity to ease the stance of policy,\u201d Schmid said in a speech in Oklahoma City.\nOverall, Schmid said he anticipates a relatively muted impact from tariffs on inflation but views that as a sign that interest rates are \u201cappropriately calibrated\u201d rather than a signal the Fed should cut rates. While he said job growth was weak over the summer, he stressed a broader set of indicators suggests the labor market is in balance.\nHe warned that the current environment is one where aggressively boosting demand could raise the risk of an outsized increase in prices as firms gain pricing power and increase the pass-through of tariffs to consumers. Schmid believes that the strength of demand will determine how much of the increase in tariffs will eventually show up in inflation.\n\u201cWith the economy still showing momentum, growing business optimism, and inflation still stuck above our objective, retaining a modestly restrictive monetary policy stance remains appropriate for the time being,\u201d he said.\nThough Schmid added a caveat: He will reassess as he receives new data on inflation, the labor market, and the economy more generally.\nRichmond Fed president Tom Barkin, taking a middle-of-the-road stance, said Tuesday the \u201cfog is lifting\u201d now that tariff deals are being nailed down, the tax bill has passed, deregulation is underway, and net immigration is down.\n\u201cWe may well see pressure on inflation, and we may also see pressure on unemployment, but the balance between the two is still unclear,\u201d Barkin said in a speech in Chicago.\nBarkin says the level of consumer spending has stayed solid, but for the economy to falter, consumer spending would need to pull back more fundamentally. He said while job gains have slowed recently and are worth watching, he\u2019s hopeful that even as businesses face increased costs from tariffs, they\u2019ll largely avoid the type of large layoffs that would spike unemployment and lead to consumer pullback.\nOther members of the Fed, like Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic and Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack, are also more concerned about inflation. While both have shown concern with the latest jobs report, they are still focused on inflation, with Bostic retaining his estimate right now for only one rate cut this year.\n\"The labor market has softened. And I would see additional slowing as unwelcome, especially since we know that once the labor market stumbles, it tends to fall quickly and hard,\" Daly said in a speech in Alaska last week. \"All this means that we will likely need to adjust policy in the coming months.\"\nFederal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman said Saturday that she is looking at three interest rate cuts this year, citing concerns she sees that further delays in cutting rates could \"result in a deterioration in labor market conditions and a further slowing in economic growth.\"\nThis story has been updated.\nJennifer Schonberger is a veteran financial journalist covering markets, the economy, and investing.

Average US tariff rates on Chinese goods are currently at about 55%, according to Bloomberg.\nLast week, Trump unveiled \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of US trade partners.\nThe next negotiations to watch are Canada, Mexico, and China in the coming months.\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nHere are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.\nLIVE 1672 updates- Keith Reid-Cleveland\nSwiss say tariffs could raise costs for US F-35A jets\nThe original price of the 36 fighter jets Switzerland is buying from the United States could go up by more than $1 billion due to the impacts of tariffs.\nReuters reports:\n- Michael B.

EU officials previously said a joint statement would follow the deal \"very soon\" along with executive orders from U.S. President Donald Trump on key carve-outs.\n\"It is an agreement that we believe is strong and the best we could have ... Of course, we expect the U.S. to take further steps that are part of this agreement but I don't believe at this stage we can put a timeline on these engagements,\" the European Commission spokesperson said.\n- Michael B. Kelley\n'Climate of uncertainty' remains after China-US trade extension\nZhou Mi, an expert at the Ministry of Commerce-backed Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told Bloomberg that there remains a \"climate of uncertainty\" despite the latest 90-day pause on additional tariffs enacted by the US on Monday.\nThe Trump administration \u201cfrequently sends out a range of signals, often through its negotiation tactics and public statements \u2014 some of which even contradict each other,\u201d Zhou told Bloomberg.\n\u201cThis creates a climate of uncertainty that makes businesses and markets increasingly concerned about the stability and outlook for economic and trade policies between China and the US, as well as the US and other countries.\"\nAverage US tariffs on good imported from China currently sit at 55%.\n- Michael B. Kelley\nSwiss precious metals group wants 'a formal and binding decision' on Trump gold tariff promise\nNot everyone is fully satisfied with President Donald Trump's social media statement on not putting tariffs on gold after uncertainty in the bullion market in recent days.\n\"President Trump's statement is an encouraging signal for trade stability,\" Christoph Wild, president of the the the Swiss precious metals association ASFCMP, stated on Tuesday. \"However, only a formal and binding decision will provide the certainty the gold sector and its partners require.\"\n- Jenny McCall\nChina urges firms not to use Nvidia H20 chips in new guidance\nChina has told local companies to avoid using Nvidia (NVDA) H20 processors, especially for government work. This makes it harder for Nvidia to recover billions in lost sales in China and affects the US government's plan to benefit from those sales.\nThis latest move by China appears to be in response to the deal Nvidia and AMD (AMD) made with the US government over the weekend to pay the US 15% of the revenue for AI-related chip sales to China, adding a monetization layer to the Trump administration's tariff policy that has reoriented global trade relationships.\nIn recent weeks, Chinese officials warned several firms against using these less advanced chips.

Bessent said officials might have cut rates if they\u2019d been aware of the revised data on the labor market that came out a couple of days after the latest meeting.

But dig a little deeper, and the moves start to stack up.\nFor starters, there\u2019s \u201ca lot of cash sitting on the sidelines,\u201d said Mohit Kumar, chief economist at Jefferies International. That means plenty of investors are ready to snap up assets at lower prices, damping any selloffs before they really get going.\nThen there\u2019s the global economy, which seems far from sinking into the recession that many feared was inevitable when Trump moved to reshape global trade in April, triggering weeks of wild price swings.\nIndeed, the US President has walked back from his most extreme tariffs threats, stoking investor confidence that he will ultimately always relent after aggressive posturing. That strategy \u2014 which analysts and strategists call \u201cTACO\u201d for \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d \u2014 mean investors have stepped in for fear of missing out on a rally.\nInvestors \u201crealize that they\u2019re watching the market go up,\u201d said Guy Miller, chief market strategist and head of macroeconomics at Zurich. \u201cThere are still a lot of risks out there, but they feel they have to participate in this.\u201d\nTo be sure, markets have seen bouts of turbulence this month. The VIX reached nearly 22 points intra-day on worse-than-expected payrolls data and tariffs, but it\u2019s already displaying the pattern that options traders are accustomed to \u2013 fast reversal to lower levels.\nThe latest retreat came this week as the S&P 500 notched a fresh record high on Tuesday afternoon, with soothing inflation data boosting bets for a Fed interest-rate cut. In contrast to earlier this year, when even one cut was in doubt, money markets are now fully pricing two-quarter point reductions and a chance of a third by year-end."

We are selective, choosing companies that we believe demonstrate growth, innovation, and strong investment potential. As such, most new stocks are rated BUY, but occasionally there is a HOLD-rated new company if we see potential. The Argus Research Fundamental Universe of Coverage includes over 500 leading U.S. and international companies. We cover the waterfront -- from Technology to Utilities from Energy to Healthcare. Generally, we follow the top 200 most widely held stocks, a list we source from our sister company Vickers Stock Research, which collects institutional ownership data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. From there, we look to identify the next 200-300 emerging U.S. and international companies to fill out our list. Our Universe of Coverage is dynamic and growing. We are continually adding stocks and often get great ideas from our clients (use https://www.argusresearch.com/ContactUs.aspx if you'd like to send us your ideas). Here are some of the additions we have made so far in 2025.\nArgus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 07/28/2025: Short-Term Trading Ideas\nMany clients of Argus Research are long-term buy-and-hold investors. As such, our proprietary BUY-HOLD-SELL ratings and target prices are established with one-year time horizons. We also have five-year ratings for even longer-term investors and pension funds. But we also have hedge fund clients that are looking for trading opportunities or for long/short portfolio ideas. The first few months of 2025, with roller-coaster ups and downs in stock prices, likely provided more opportunities for momentum traders than for fundamental investors. The list below includes some of the shorter-term trading ideas our analysts and strategists have identified recently. All the stocks listed below are rated BUY at Argus.\nFear Index Back to Normal Levels\nAfter a period of intense market volatility in the spring -- including one point at which the S&P 500 had fallen 19% from its all-time high -- the closely-watched VIX Volatility Index has declined back below its historical average of 20 as summer swings into high gear. Meanwhile, stock prices have recovered all of the lost ground and the benchmark S&P is once again setting record highs. We can't say that March-April downdraft was unexpected. Indeed, in our 2025 Market Outlook, we noted that investor complacency was high, tariffs and trade wars could slow the economy, and that stock valuations were susceptible in the event of a sell-off in the Information Technology sector. That was our Bearish Case, and certain elements may well linger for the next few months, at least. Our Base Case called for another year of growth in the U.S. economy (and no recession), declining interest rates, and double-digit EPS growth. Each of those planks in the Base Case platform is currently in place. So assuming that the Trump administration gets its economic growth plans firmly on track, there's reason to expect that equity prices can continue to climb. Back to the market, the current VIX fear index reading is south of 16, which is well below the 10-year average of 20 and consistent with a bull market. Indeed, during the long bull market in the 2010s, the VIX averaged 18 and even touched lows below 10 in 2017. We continue to think that the S&P 500 is in the early/mid-stage of a bull market that dates to October 2022. And while the path for equities won't be straight up, we suggest investors favor growth stocks in their portfolios at the current market and economic juncture.\nInitiating with intermediate- and long-term BUY ratings\nCoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, went public in March 2025. Originally a crypto mining firm, it shifted its main focus to cloud computing in 2022. The company's CoreWeave Cloud Platform, launched in 2020, has grown rapidly at a pace with AI demand. The company was an early customer for Nvidia's AI solutions and maintains a strong partnership with Nvidia. As of the end of 2024, CoreWeave operated 32 data centers with over 250,000 GPUs. Recently, CoreWeave in June 20205 announced its intention to acquire Core Scientific for $9 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nRatingPrice Target"

While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\"\nThe payment, which could face legal challenges, won't show up in Nvidia's Q2 report but could boost its Q3 outlook if the administration moves quickly.\nWhile the company might not bring in as much for itself from China sales as investors had hoped, the agreement is Nvidia's current best chance to compete in one of the world's largest AI markets.\n\"From my perspective, it is a positive for those companies. As you know, it opens a market where there's still high demand. Nvidia, especially, still has a lot of cache with its name,\" Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen explained.\nAccess to China now helps Nvidia in the long run\nRegaining access to China doesn't just help Nvidia in the near term \u2014 it also sets up the company for continued sales into the future as customers develop and deploy apps and services using its CUDA software.\nAccording to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, while rival Chinese chipmakers might match and, in some cases, exceed the H20's performance, developers are already building on CUDA, making switching to competing platforms costly and difficult.\n\"The Chinese already have products, local products, that are actually, from the performance, better than what Nvidia is allowed to sell,\" Rasgon told Yahoo Finance."

      "text": "By Davide Barbuscia\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are betting harder on a September Federal Reserve interest rate cut after last month's mild inflation bump, which indicated the pass-through from President Donald Trump's sweeping import duties to goods prices has so far been limited.\nJuly inflation numbers released on Tuesday came in largely within expectations, strengthening traders' bets the Fed will start cutting rates at its next policy meeting in September, particularly after a weak employment report in July and sharp downward revisions to job figures for May and June.\n\"I think that the market coming in was quietly expecting a hotter number, and it didn't,\" said Andrew Szczurowski, co-head of the mortgage and securitized investment team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n\"When you factor in the other side of their (the Fed's) mandate, then all of a sudden it looks like they're missing their labor target more than they're missing their inflation target,\" he said.\nRates futures traders increased bets on a 25 basis point interest rate cut in September after the data release, with the probability of a September cut rising to 98% against about 89% earlier on Tuesday, according to LSEG data.\nTwo-year Treasury yields, which tend to reflect expectations of changes in monetary policy, declined after the data and were last at 3.729%, about two basis points lower on the day.\nThe consumer price index rose 0.2% last month, in line with expectations, and rose 2.7% year on year, below consensus forecasts of 2.8%.\nTrump used the subdued headline CPI to reinforce his claim that tariffs do not hit consumers, taking aim at Goldman Sachs economists for what he said were bad predictions on the tariff impact.\nJoseph Lavorgna, counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, said Tuesday's inflation figures indicated that exporters were largely absorbing tariffs by cutting prices.\n\"Every month, we keep waiting for the inflation that doesn't present itself, and then people say we need clarity. No, you've had six months in a row where the numbers have disappointed to the downside. Effectively, where you thought there would be inflation, there isn't,\" he said.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.3%, the biggest gain since January, after climbing 0.2% in June. The so-called core CPI increased 3.1% year-on-year in July after advancing 2.9% in June.\nTiffany Wilding, economist at bond manager PIMCO, said she expected core CPI to tick higher to a peak of 3.4% by year-end as tariff-related costs are passed on to consumers."

      "text": "Stock market today: S&P 500 closes above 6,400 for first time as rate cut bets jump after CPI inflation report\nIn this article:\nThe S&P 500 closed above 6,400 for the first time ever amid a broad stock market rally on Tuesday as Wall Street digested fresh inflation data.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 1.1% or nearly 500 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped nearly 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also added around 1.4%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at record levels.\nThe small-cap Russell 200 Index (^RUT) also soared amid rate-cut optimism, rising nearly 3% on the day.\nThe latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that \"core\" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 3.1% over the past year in July, ahead of June's 2.9% increase. The reading indicated that rising goods inflation is no longer being offset by easing services inflation.\nBut on a headline basis, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% year over year, matching June and coming in softer than economists' expectations of a 2.8% rise.\nAfter the inflation report's release, bets jumped on a Fed rate cut in September. Around 94% of traders expect that outcome, according to the CME Group.\nThe report was the first major piece of economic data to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics after Trump fired Erika McEntarfer as commissioner earlier this month, following the release of the July jobs report. Late Monday, Trump announced that he nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the agency.\nInvestors will get two more pulse checks on the state of the economy later this week, with the release of the Producer Price Index on Thursday and retail sales data on Friday.\nIn corporate news, Intel (INTC) stock gained over 5% after CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with Trump, who had called for Tan's resignation just last week.\nAfter the meeting, Trump posted to Truth Social calling the meeting \"a very interesting one\" and hailing the CEO's \"success and rise\" as \"an amazing story.\"\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 18 updates"

      "text": "In this article:\nBy Juby Babu and Krystal Hu\n(Reuters) -CoreWeave (CRWV) easily topped quarterly revenue estimates on Tuesday as the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence tools boosted demand for its cloud services, but a bigger-than-expected net loss sent its shares slumping 9% in premarket trading on Wednesday.\nThe company currently operates 33 AI data centers across the U.S. and Europe and offers access to backer Nvidia's (NVDA) chips, which are highly coveted by enterprises to train and run large AI models amid intense competition.\nCoreWeave posted second-quarter revenue of $1.21 billion, beating estimates of $1.08 billion. It also reported a revenue backlog of $30.1 billion as of the end of June, compared with $25.9 billion on March 31.\n\"Demand is humming, but it is the cost of growth that tempered the stock down in aftermarket trading,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman of Running Point Capital Advisors.\nOperating expenses jumped to $1.19 billion in the second quarter, from $317.7 million a year earlier.\nThe company posted a net loss of $290.5 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $190.6 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\"We are scaling rapidly as we look to meet the unprecedented demand for AI,\" CEO Michael Intrator said. \"There's a lot of different pieces that are constrained, but ultimately the piece that is the most significant challenge right now is accessing power shells that are capable of delivering the scale of infrastructure that our clients are requiring.\"\nThe company reiterated the benefits of its $9 billion all-stock deal for crypto miner Core Scientific, which will help it secure the firm's entire 1.3 GW power under contract and future pipeline. The comment comes as Two Seas Capital, the largest shareholder of Core Scientific, said last week it would vote against the sale.\nInvestors have also focused on the company's reliance on a few big customers. CoreWeave said it has also expanded contracts with hyperscalers in the past few weeks to meet their growing internal and external demand.\n\"The backlog surge to $30B+ suggests demand visibility well beyond 2025, but the concentration in mega-customers like OpenAI means those relationships remain both the crown jewel and the single point of failure,\" said eMarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman.\nCoreWeave has seen rising demand for AI inference, especially when models use chain-of-thought reasoning to go through a problem in a logical sequence \u2014 a technique doubled down on by frontier labs such as OpenAI."

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 3.4%, the S&P 500 rose 5.3%, and the Nasdaq was up 7.2%. For the year to date, the DJIA and the S&P 500 have turned positive, up 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively. The Nasdaq, down 0.5%, is close to moving into the green. Earnings season is winding down. The list of reports this week includes Palo Alto Networks on Tuesday; Target, TJX, Lowe's, and Zoom Communications on Wednesday; Intuit, Analog Devices, Williams-Sonoma, and Ralph Lauren on Thursday; and Nordstrom on Friday. Some 92% of S&P 500 companies have reported, and earnings for the quarter are up 14% from the prior-year quarter. That is far above the consensus call for EPS growth of about 3%-8% and follows 17% growth in 4Q24 EPS and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare is the leading sector, up 46%, and Energy is at the bottom, down 17%. For all of 2025, the Argus full-year earnings estimate is for low-double-digit growth from 2024. On the economic calendar, Existing Homes Sales are due out on Thursday and New Home Sales on Friday. As well, multiple Fed officials will speak publicly. The Economic Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is for growth in home prices to slow further. Prices of new and existing homes are reported along with home sales. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors will report existing home sales for April. We expect sales of 4.1 million homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. On Friday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will report new home sales for April. We expect sales of 650,000 homes at an annual rate. In March, the 'months supply' of existing homes rose to a still-healthy 4.0 months from 3.5 in February, though growth in existing home prices eased to 2.7% from 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. In the new home market, supply declined to 8.3 months in March from 8.9 in February, but prices slumped 2.9%. The Zillow Home Value Index for all homes rose 1.4% in April, compared with 2.6% in January, this as mortgage rates near 7% strain affordability. For other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 2.4% for 2Q. This follows the surprise decline of 0.3% for 1Q GDP. The Argus 2025 GDP growth estimate has been lowered to 0.5% from 1.3%. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.4% rate for CPI in May, higher than the April rate. Mortgage rates inched higher last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.81%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down three cents to an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 9% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next meeting after that is on July 30, when odds jump to 33% for a cut.\nRecent weakness provides buying opportunity\nCAVA Group, Inc., founded in 2006, owns and operates a chain of Mediterranean restaurants. The company has 10,300 employees.\nRatingPrice TargetLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to\nLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to the tariff-induced plunge in stock prices that took place at the very end of the April 4 trading week. But that is old news, as a suspension of tariffs on April 9 sent stocks soaring, a pullback was evident on April 10, optimism kicked in on April 11, and tariffs were modified for many technology products over the weekend. Traders reacting to the daily news flow likely have unprecedented whiplash. But so do most other investors, insiders included. But as we said above, current weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research (complied before the weekend action on technology products) has morphed, and the change is exceedingly bullish. On a scale where any ratio below 2.00 is bullish, the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, and anything above 6.00 is bearish, Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.31 (versus 2.72 last week). Drilling down to exchanges, the NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 0.95, versus 2.14, and the Nasdaq One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.99, versus 3.35. For comparison, the last time Vickers' one-week data was this bullish was in November of 2023. On a sector basis, insider buying exceeded selling in Consumer Discretionary last week, with shares valued at $38 million bought versus $1.5 million sold. Buying was also notable in Healthcare, as shares valued at $18 million were bought versus $10 million sold, as well as in Financials, Real Estate, and Energy. Selling was the greatest in Industrials over the last week, with shares valued at $28 million sold versus $14 million bought, as well as in Information Technology, Utilities, and Consumer Staples (though the volume of transactions in many of these sectors was low). This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Sinclair Inc. (NGS: SBGI) and Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE: WSM)."

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 3.4%, the S&P 500 rose 5.3%, and the Nasdaq was up 7.2%. For the year to date, the DJIA and the S&P 500 have turned positive, up 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively. The Nasdaq, down 0.5%, is close to moving into the green. Earnings season is winding down. The list of reports this week includes Palo Alto Networks on Tuesday; Target, TJX, Lowe's, and Zoom Communications on Wednesday; Intuit, Analog Devices, Williams-Sonoma, and Ralph Lauren on Thursday; and Nordstrom on Friday. Some 92% of S&P 500 companies have reported, and earnings for the quarter are up 14% from the prior-year quarter. That is far above the consensus call for EPS growth of about 3%-8% and follows 17% growth in 4Q24 EPS and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare is the leading sector, up 46%, and Energy is at the bottom, down 17%. For all of 2025, the Argus full-year earnings estimate is for low-double-digit growth from 2024. On the economic calendar, Existing Homes Sales are due out on Thursday and New Home Sales on Friday. As well, multiple Fed officials will speak publicly. The Economic Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is for growth in home prices to slow further. Prices of new and existing homes are reported along with home sales. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors will report existing home sales for April. We expect sales of 4.1 million homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. On Friday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will report new home sales for April. We expect sales of 650,000 homes at an annual rate. In March, the 'months supply' of existing homes rose to a still-healthy 4.0 months from 3.5 in February, though growth in existing home prices eased to 2.7% from 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. In the new home market, supply declined to 8.3 months in March from 8.9 in February, but prices slumped 2.9%. The Zillow Home Value Index for all homes rose 1.4% in April, compared with 2.6% in January, this as mortgage rates near 7% strain affordability. For other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 2.4% for 2Q. This follows the surprise decline of 0.3% for 1Q GDP. The Argus 2025 GDP growth estimate has been lowered to 0.5% from 1.3%. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.4% rate for CPI in May, higher than the April rate. Mortgage rates inched higher last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.81%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down three cents to an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 9% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next meeting after that is on July 30, when odds jump to 33% for a cut.\nRecent weakness provides buying opportunity\nCAVA Group, Inc., founded in 2006, owns and operates a chain of Mediterranean restaurants. The company has 10,300 employees.\nRatingPrice TargetLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to\nLast week, we commented that corporate insiders had little time to react to the tariff-induced plunge in stock prices that took place at the very end of the April 4 trading week. But that is old news, as a suspension of tariffs on April 9 sent stocks soaring, a pullback was evident on April 10, optimism kicked in on April 11, and tariffs were modified for many technology products over the weekend. Traders reacting to the daily news flow likely have unprecedented whiplash. But so do most other investors, insiders included. But as we said above, current weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research (complied before the weekend action on technology products) has morphed, and the change is exceedingly bullish. On a scale where any ratio below 2.00 is bullish, the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, and anything above 6.00 is bearish, Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.31 (versus 2.72 last week). Drilling down to exchanges, the NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 0.95, versus 2.14, and the Nasdaq One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.99, versus 3.35. For comparison, the last time Vickers' one-week data was this bullish was in November of 2023. On a sector basis, insider buying exceeded selling in Consumer Discretionary last week, with shares valued at $38 million bought versus $1.5 million sold. Buying was also notable in Healthcare, as shares valued at $18 million were bought versus $10 million sold, as well as in Financials, Real Estate, and Energy. Selling was the greatest in Industrials over the last week, with shares valued at $28 million sold versus $14 million bought, as well as in Information Technology, Utilities, and Consumer Staples (though the volume of transactions in many of these sectors was low). This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Sinclair Inc. (NGS: SBGI) and Williams-Sonoma Inc. (NYSE: WSM)."

      "text": "Wall Street strategists are sharply recalibrating their economic outlooks after Friday's July jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring and staggering downward revisions to prior months' data, suggesting the labor market may be losing steam at a quicker pace than previously thought.\nThe US economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below the 104,000 expected by economists. But the bigger surprise came from revisions to the May and June figures, which collectively erased 258,000 jobs. This marked the largest two-month downward revision since May 2020.\nSarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, called the July jobs report \"a dud\" in a client note titled \"July and the No Good, Very Bad Jobs Report.\"\n\"The 'solid' state of the labor market described by the FOMC earlier this week looks more questionable after the July employment report,\" she said, citing broad-based hiring weakness in cyclically sensitive sectors like manufacturing, retail, and professional services.\nDespite persistent strength in healthcare hiring, she added, \"the pace [of job growth] has lurched lower to just 35K\" over the past three months when factoring in revisions.\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, bluntly told Yahoo Finance that the July numbers were simply \"not good. There's no way to sugarcoat that. The two-month revision is just staggering. It basically wipes out two months of what we thought were healthy job gains.\"\nCiti economist Veronica Clark agreed, telling Yahoo Finance, \"It's not so much this July number, but the massive downward revisions to the June number that we had last month. ... This definitely does look like a labor market that is weakening.\"\nMeanwhile, Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, called the report a \"gamechanger\" in a post on X, echoing others in saying \"the labor market now looks a lot weaker than expected.\"\nThe unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% in July, in line with expectations and still near historic lows. But as Clark pointed out, \"that happened despite the labor force participation rate falling more,\" a shift some economists have linked to President Trump's immigration crackdown.\nAhead of the report, there were growing concerns that increased deportations were reducing labor supply and keeping the jobless rate artificially low.\nSeptember rate cut odds surge\nThe revised data has added urgency to calls for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, with market pricing shifting notably in the aftermath.\n\"We still anticipate that the Fed starts to cut in September with consecutive cuts thereafter leading to about 100 basis points of cuts in total,\" said Leslie Falcone, head of taxable fixed income strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nFalcone noted that while the Fed had already turned more cautious, the scale of the revisions surprised even the most dovish forecasters. \"Some of these revisions are much more than what people expected. ... I do think that this is a bit on the weaker side. And it does put cuts back on the table.\"\nTraders seem to agree. Following the report, the probability of a September rate cut surged to about 80%, up from just 38% the day prior, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\nEarlier this week, Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller broke from the majority of FOMC officials, dissenting against the decision to hold interest rates steady after warning that the labor market was weaker than initial data had indicated.\nThat warning appeared prescient on Friday as markets tumbled following the report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell over 2% by midmorning, the Dow (DOW) shed nearly 600 points, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 1.6%. Meanwhile, bond prices surged on increased rate cut bets, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) down 11 basis points to around 4.2%.\nAdding to labor market concerns, escalating trade tensions were also top of mind for investors as Trump hiked tariff rates on several US trading partners, including a surprise 39% tariff on Switzerland.\n\"The market had sort of put tariffs in the rearview mirror and assumed that the labor market was okay,\" Sosnick said. \"Well, both of those assumptions have been overturned quite dramatically this morning.\"\nThe strategist warned markets appear to be entering a \"reckoning period,\" explaining, \"We're not seeing a lot of reflexive dip buying. ... That, to me, tells me that the psychology, at least as of this particular moment, is a bit more tenuous than it was.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled Steve Sosnick's name.

The announcement came on the heels of the company's first-ever earnings report since its blockbuster public debut, which showed better-than-expected revenue during the quarter.\nIn an SEC filing, the stablecoin issuer said it is offering 2 million shares of Class A common stock and 8 million shares by existing stockholders.\nIn day trading, Circle shares closed north of $163 per share, or more than 1% higher, after the company's second quarter total revenue came in at $658 million, versus the $647 million analysts expected.\nCEO Jeremy Allaire said the company's stablecoin, USDC (USDC-USD), was the \"fastest-growing major stablecoin over the past year.\"\nUSDC in circulation grew 90% year over year to $61.3 billion at quarter end and has grown an additional 6.4% to $65.2 billion as of Aug. 10.\n\"Overall activity globally in the digital asset economy has been growing,\" Allaire told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday morning.\n\"We're continuing to see growth in the use of dollar digital currencies like USDC as a store of value around the world in cross-border settlements,\" he added. \"Use cases continue to expand, and I think people are finding that this is an incredibly high utility, new form of money.\"\nThe company also announced ARC, a new blockchain network for stablecoin finance that will launch in the second half of the year.\n\"We wanted to create a way for institutions to pay fees on blockchains in a fast, predictable manner that would be simple from an accounting perspective and could deliver very low-cost and stable fees,\" Allaire said during the company's earnings call on Tuesday morning.\nCircle, which went public on June 5, has been at the center of optimism over the stablecoin market following the passage of the GENIUS Act, legislation that creates guardrails and a framework for digital tokens backed by assets such as the US dollar.\nRead more: Can you buy crypto with a credit card?

      "text": "Japan manufacturers' sentiment rises in August after US trade deal, but tariffs cloud outlook: Reuters poll\nBy Makiko Yamazaki\nTOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese manufacturers grew more confident about business conditions in August after a trade agreement between Tokyo and Washington, but remained cautious about the outlook due to potential U.S. tariff impacts, a Reuters Tankan poll showed.\nThe monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business survey, showed the manufacturers' sentiment index rising to plus 9 in August from plus 7 in July, marking a second straight month of improvement.\nBut the index is projected to decline to plus 4 over the next three months, signalling that manufacturers remain guarded about how the U.S. tariffs would impact their businesses.\nThe poll, conducted between July 30 and August 8, surveyed 497 major non-financial companies, with 241 responding on condition of anonymity.\nLast month, Japan secured a trade deal with the U.S. that lowers tariffs on cars and other goods to 15% in exchange for a U.S.-bound $550 billion Japanese investment package that will come in the form of equity, loans and guarantees.\nAmong manufacturers, the sentiment index for the transport machinery sector, which includes Japan's vital auto industry, surged to plus 25 in August from plus 9 in July. However, it is projected to slip back to plus 9 in November.\n\"The business outlook remains uncertain as the U.S. tariff policies are forcing the entire automobile industry to overhaul its production plans,\" an auto industry manager wrote in the survey.\nAnother manager from the sector cited slowing sales of Japanese cars in China, in addition to the U.S. tariffs, as a source of concern.\nThe food industry saw the sharpest decline among all sectors, with its sentiment index falling to minus 25 from zero, with some managers pointing to persistent surges in ingredient and material costs.\nFor non-manufacturers, the business sentiment index fell to plus 24 in August from plus 30 in July, its first decline in five months. Companies expect a slight rebound to plus 25 in the next three months.\nReal estate and construction firms, as well as retail firms, reported declines in their respective indexes, though they remained in positive territory, signalling that optimists outnumber pessimists.\nSome managers at retail firms cited a drop in store visitors, while a services firm manager said heatwaves were affecting business.\n(Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Himani Sarkar)"

This was on full display Tuesday with Meta (META) and Palantir (PLTR) closing at record highs.\n\"Investors are back to their usual embrace of US large cap Tech stocks over large caps in general and the move is not yet overdone,\" DataTrek Research co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a Tuesday research note.\nRabe highlighted how the top 20 stocks by market cap in the index have risen an average of 40.6% since the bottom, far outpacing the benchmark index's 27.9% gain over the same time period.

Another blast of positive catalysts has given the crypto world even more room to run this week.\nAnd most notably, the big news items don't really involve bitcoin.\nCircle (CRCL), the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue for the first time since going public.\nBitmine (BMNR), an Ethereum treasury company, announced plans to sell up to another $20 billion worth of stock to boost its holdings of the cryptocurrency.\nAnd an array of popular altcoins are gaining ground.\nThe moves collectively reflect the warm embrace of the Trump administration, which has championed the crypto industry and shifted the regulatory environment long seen as an obstacle to the adoption and growth of digital currency.\nBut the success of Wall Street's crypto hedges also underscores rising institutional interest.

And companies are chasing the returns of amassing tokens in a feedback loop that, however fleeting and precarious, seems to be paying off.\nHome to the fastest-growing major stablecoin over the past year, Circle shares are up more than 400% from its IPO price of $31 per share.

During the same period last year, Brinker posted net income of $57.3 million ($1.24 per share) on $1.2 billion in revenue.\nThe results were also better than Wall Street expected. Estimates going into the report were for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.47 and revenue of $1.44 billion.\nChili's was the standout this quarter, with 23.7% sales growth and 16% traffic growth. Comparable sales at Maggiano's declined 0.4%.\n\"With that sustained momentum, along with a strong pipeline of initiatives, we are confident in our ability to grow sales and traffic throughout Fiscal 2026,\" CEO Kevin Hochman said in a statement. \"Chili's is officially back, baby back!\"\nBrinker expects fiscal 2026 revenue to be between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion.

Adjusted earnings beat by $0.03, coming in at $0.16.\nSame-store sales came in lower than expected, up 2.1%, driven by menu prices and product mix. Meanwhile, guest foot traffic was flat, far less than the 6.14% jump expected by the Street.\nIn the release, CEO Brett Schulman called it a \"fluid macroeconomic environment,\" adding that it \"continued to grow market share\" during the quarter.\nFor the full year, the company expects same-store sales growth of 4% to 6%, down from the previously expected range of 6% to 8%.\n- Grace O'Donnell\nCoreWeave Q2 revenue beats estimates, but results come up against high bar\nNvidia (NVDA)-backed AI cloud company CoreWeave (CRWV) delivered solid revenue growth in its second quarterly report since going public, but its loss per share widened. The stock fell 6% in after-hours trading.\nWall Street expected strong top-line numbers going into earnings, as robust AI demand, a deal with Core Scientific, and a $4 billion expansion deal with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) fueled the quarter.

This is the same location for TLT as at the start of 2025 and also was hit in April. TLT lost the level on May 21, but quickly recovered, creating a false breakdown and an Arbeter's Fish Hook bottom. Since July 2023, TLT has traded in a range between $82 and $102. Unfortunately, most of the price action since the latter part of 2024 has been in the lower half of the range. Longer-term, the long end of the Treasury yield remains in a bear market that started following the peak in prices during the pandemic in March 2020. Sentiment is neutral for the 10-year Treasury, while seasonality turned bullish in mid-June -- and lasts into mid-September. Technically, the bond market remains a very tough read. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading at $67.60/barrel and has calmed after an explosive move higher and then a complete downside reversal (basically to where the volatility started. As long as crude oil is being whipped around by headlines out of the Middle East, it's impossible to forecast based on technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and even geopolitical analysis (other than the obvious). We will say that WTI cycled into extreme overbought territory recently. Every time that has occurred in the past few years, prices have been smacked. So far, that has happened again. On the flipside, oil prices have held the prior breakout region near $64/$65, and that's a minor positive, at least for now.

We are selective, choosing companies that we believe demonstrate growth, innovation, and strong investment potential. As such, most new stocks are rated BUY, but occasionally there is a HOLD-rated new company if we see potential. The Argus Research Fundamental Universe of Coverage includes over 500 leading U.S. and international companies. We cover the waterfront -- from Technology to Utilities from Energy to Healthcare. Generally, we follow the top 200 most widely held stocks, a list we source from our sister company Vickers Stock Research, which collects institutional ownership data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. From there, we look to identify the next 200-300 emerging U.S. and international companies to fill out our list. Our Universe of Coverage is dynamic and growing. We are continually adding stocks and often get great ideas from our clients (use https://www.argusresearch.com/ContactUs.aspx if you'd like to send us your ideas). Here are some of the additions we have made so far in 2025.\nArgus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 07/28/2025: Short-Term Trading Ideas\nMany clients of Argus Research are long-term buy-and-hold investors. As such, our proprietary BUY-HOLD-SELL ratings and target prices are established with one-year time horizons. We also have five-year ratings for even longer-term investors and pension funds. But we also have hedge fund clients that are looking for trading opportunities or for long/short portfolio ideas. The first few months of 2025, with roller-coaster ups and downs in stock prices, likely provided more opportunities for momentum traders than for fundamental investors. The list below includes some of the shorter-term trading ideas our analysts and strategists have identified recently. All the stocks listed below are rated BUY at Argus.\nFear Index Back to Normal Levels\nAfter a period of intense market volatility in the spring -- including one point at which the S&P 500 had fallen 19% from its all-time high -- the closely-watched VIX Volatility Index has declined back below its historical average of 20 as summer swings into high gear. Meanwhile, stock prices have recovered all of the lost ground and the benchmark S&P is once again setting record highs. We can't say that March-April downdraft was unexpected. Indeed, in our 2025 Market Outlook, we noted that investor complacency was high, tariffs and trade wars could slow the economy, and that stock valuations were susceptible in the event of a sell-off in the Information Technology sector. That was our Bearish Case, and certain elements may well linger for the next few months, at least. Our Base Case called for another year of growth in the U.S. economy (and no recession), declining interest rates, and double-digit EPS growth. Each of those planks in the Base Case platform is currently in place. So assuming that the Trump administration gets its economic growth plans firmly on track, there's reason to expect that equity prices can continue to climb. Back to the market, the current VIX fear index reading is south of 16, which is well below the 10-year average of 20 and consistent with a bull market. Indeed, during the long bull market in the 2010s, the VIX averaged 18 and even touched lows below 10 in 2017. We continue to think that the S&P 500 is in the early/mid-stage of a bull market that dates to October 2022. And while the path for equities won't be straight up, we suggest investors favor growth stocks in their portfolios at the current market and economic juncture.\nInitiating with intermediate- and long-term BUY ratings\nCoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, went public in March 2025. Originally a crypto mining firm, it shifted its main focus to cloud computing in 2022. The company's CoreWeave Cloud Platform, launched in 2020, has grown rapidly at a pace with AI demand. The company was an early customer for Nvidia's AI solutions and maintains a strong partnership with Nvidia. As of the end of 2024, CoreWeave operated 32 data centers with over 250,000 GPUs. Recently, CoreWeave in June 20205 announced its intention to acquire Core Scientific for $9 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nRatingPrice Target"

  "argos_summary": "US stocks rose on Wednesday as expectations grew for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut following recent inflation data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased nearly 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also saw gains. Despite a slight uptick in inflation, the data was less than anticipated, leading traders to price in a nearly 100% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting. In corporate news, shares of Cava fell after the company lowered its annual sales growth target, while CoreWeave's stock dropped despite beating revenue estimates due to a larger-than-expected net loss.",
