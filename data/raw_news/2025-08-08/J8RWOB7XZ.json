  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to New York Attorney General Letitia James for records related to a civil fraud case against President Donald Trump and a separate case against the National Rifle Association, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\n\nThe two people could not publicly discuss specific details of the investigation and spoke to the AP on Friday on condition of anonymity.\n\nGeoff Burgan, a spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office, declined to confirm the subpoenas but issued a statement that said, \u201cAny weaponization of the justice system should disturb every American. We stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, James\u2019 personal attorney, Abbe D. Lowell, said \u201cif prosecutors carry out this improper tactic and are genuinely interested in the truth, we are ready and waiting with the facts and the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestigating the fraud case Attorney General James won against President Trump and his businesses has to be the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign,\u201d Lowell said. \u201cWeaponizing the Department of Justice to try to punish an elected official for doing her job is an attack on the rule of law and a dangerous escalation by this administration.\u201d\n\nJames has sued Trump and his administration dozens of times over his policies as president and over how he conducted his private business empire. Trump is appealing the multimillion-dollar judgment she won against him in a lawsuit alleging that he defrauded banks and other lenders by giving them financial statements that inflated the value of his properties, including his golf clubs and penthouse in Trump Tower.\n\nTrump says his financial statements actually understated his wealth and that any mistakes in the documents were harmless errors that played no role in banks\u2019 lending decisions. He and his lawyers have repeatedly accused James of engaging in \u201clawfare\u201d for political purposes - a claim she has denied.\n\nThe subpoenas were issued as part of an investigation into whether James violated Trump\u2019s civil rights, another person familiar with the matter told the AP. The person could not discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe subpoenas mark an escalation of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to scrutinize perceived adversaries of the president, including those like James who had investigated Trump before his election win last November.\n\nNews of the subpoena comes as the Justice Department advances an investigation into the Trump-Russia probe that shadowed Trump for much of his first term as president and as the administration has engaged in a widespread purge from the workforce of law enforcement officials who had been involved in examining the activities of Trump and his supporters.",
