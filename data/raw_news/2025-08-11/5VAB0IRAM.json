  "description": "The economy may rest most heavily on consumers, but it and retirements don\u2019t exist without companies that can do business without unregulated threats.",
  "content": "The topic of regulation often sits in the penumbra of companies. Many executives hate them. Some regulation is overdone. Much of it isn\u2019t, being instead expressions of restraint when corporations behave recklessly, damaging the public and the balance of the economic system. Large regulatory packages have often enabled greater trust, attention to operations, and ultimately higher profitability overall.\n\nAs often as regulation is necessary for companies, it is also required through laws and constitutional guarantees for government entities and officials who otherwise would misuse their powers over businesses and the many millions of retirement accounts that require economic success to thrive.\n\nDonald Trump has established a practice of singling out both individuals and particular companies. Criticism on the part of the nation\u2019s chief executives, whether publicly or privately expressed, isn\u2019t new. They are people and will act as people do.\n\nHowever, the newest expression of it is unusual. Trump reportedly demanded that U.S. chip companies, Nvidia and AMD, pay the government a percentage of their revenue from sales to China, according to the Financial Times. The two companies agreed so they could get the export licenses necessary to ship products, reportedly admitting it to the newspaper.\n\nAlso, according to the story, unnamed expert sources said that this type of arrangement was \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Companies have never before paid commissions for permissions.\n\nOn August 7y, 20205, Trump called on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign because a Republican senator was concerned about Tan\u2019s reported investments in Chinese companies, Business Insider reported. Holding shares in Chinese companies is a common part of investment portfolio diversity. Days later, Trump praised Tan\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d online, Business Insider separately wrote.\n\nHowever, in a broader sense, this is not the first attempt by Trump at deals following economic threats. In April, Trump announced a deal with five major law firms for $600 million in free legal work, as The Hill and others reported. The payoff for the firms was that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would withdraw letters asking about hiring practices in an alleged attempt to target diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\n\n\u201cThe EEOC is prepared to root out discrimination anywhere it may rear its head, including in our nation\u2019s elite law firms,\u201d acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas said in a statement, as The Hill reported in a separate article. Trump had also chosen law firms for their past clients and cases.\n\nTrump accused banks in early August of political discrimination, wrote The Wall Street Journal. He wrote an executive order claiming that banks \u201chave engaged in unacceptable practices to restrict law-abiding individuals\u2019 and businesses\u2019 access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, there can be illegal discrimination if based on \u201crace, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age.\u201d Political beliefs are not a protected category.\n\nLast week, Trump told major pharmaceutical to lower prices or face punishment, as Agence France-Presse wrote. He wanted the companies to work with the administration to make changes within two months, including a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d policy that would require the companies to sell at the lowest price paid by other countries.\n\nThe efforts to force companies in multiple industries to act one way or another remain highly unusual and speak to the reason why such actions are considered so unusual and undesired. A president can exert enormous power from the bully pulpit alone.\n\nExtend efforts to the powers of the state and what a president can do is terrible. It harkens back to Richard Nixon\u2019s famous enemies list and his willingness to use such agencies as the IRS and FBI to attack political adversaries.\n\nIn the present, the actions the Trump administration has taken show the reasons why such activities have been either illegal or considered unacceptable as norms. They can unbalance industries, upend commerce, and disturb complex social and financial mechanisms without consideration of the extent of damage that might happen.\n\nAll these perturbations, as tariffs on GM profits showed, can effectively become taxes on everyone\u2019s retirement funds. With a large aging segment of the population, this ultimately is not good for anyone.",

      "text": "For everyone thinking that maybe tariffs wouldn\u2019t have a big impact on the U.S., automaker General Motor\u2019s earnings release and call on Tuesday morning, July 22, were a reminder of how bad they can be.\nNot just for the company, but for everyone who depends on the performance of stock for their futures \u2014 pretty much everyone with a retirement account. Equities are a mainstay of retirement savings, whether IRAs, 401(k)s, or pension funds. When the returns start getting hit, so do the value of these accounts.\nThe Numbers\nTo understand how corporate results tie into retirement, take GM as a single example, using data from their earnings filings and a transcript of the earnings call, made available by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nCompany revenue in the second quarter was a little off, down 1.8% year over year, from $47.97 billion to $47.12 billion. However, net income attributable to stockholders, also known as profit, was down by $1.038 billion, or -35.4%, year over year.\nFor the full half year, revenue was up 0.2% year-over-year, from $90.98 billion in 2024 to $91.14 billion in 2025. Net income, though, dropped from $5.91 billion to $4.68 billion, a reduction of $1.23 billion or -20.9%.\nIn Q2, there was a net impact of $1.1 billion due to tariffs, and that was \u201cslightly lower\u201d than expected, as was mentioned in the earnings call.\nThat could have come in many ways. Steel and aluminum faced tariffs of 25%. There were tariffs on goods coming from Canada and Mexico, and significant portions of automobile manufacturing are done in both countries.\nNone of this counts the tariffs on copper, which are supposed to go into effect next month. The company also expects third-quarter net tariff costs to be even higher than in Q2.\nReal Costs Of Tariffs\n\u201cAs we previously mentioned, mitigation efforts will take time to yield results, limiting their effect on the second quarter,\u201d GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during the call. \u201cHowever, we're still tracking to offset at least 30% of the $4 billion to $5 billion full year 2025 tariff impact through strategic actions such as manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives and consistent pricing.\u201d\nJacobson also said that \u201cour gross tariff impact remains unchanged at $4 billion to $5 billion this year as we continue to produce and import vehicles from Canada, Mexico, and Korea to avoid interruptions for our customers and dealers.\u201d\nThe amount of money they will have to spend to further reduce tariffs is not mentioned but likely large. This includes adding 300,000 units of U.S. capacity for light-duty pickups and full-size SUVs and crossovers, all of which are high-margin vehicles that can bear the additional costs of domestic manufacturing. They are also increasing utilization of existing U.S. capacity, which is a tacit acknowledgment that manufacturing and assembly in Mexico is largely a way to reduce labor costs by cutting jobs here.\nTariff Implications\nThis is just one admittedly very large company. The supposed point of the tariffs was to encourage domestic manufacturing. Perhaps that will ultimately work, but at what cost? Domestic providers won\u2019t be the salvation because they have been raising prices as tariffs on foreign goods give them room to do so. Why sell well under market prices if you don\u2019t have to?\nEventually prices will go up. Companies will also look to automate as much as possible, cutting jobs and wages going forward, as materials, components, and inventory continue to increase in price, given that domestic labor costs are high in comparison to that of outsourced manufacturing. The impact on employment could likely be the opposite of what tariff proponents said would happen.\nAdditional problems also spring up. When people lose jobs, they stop spending as much because they don\u2019t have the money. When corporate profits hurt, for whatever reason, company valuations drop. GM shares fell 8.12% on Tuesday. That was a market capitalization drop of $4.15 billion, 8.1%, overnight. Such changes, especially when multiple corporations face them, affect retirement portfolios and the holdings of pension funds. It\u2019s like an unofficial additional tax on your retirement.\nThe next two or three months should offer more insight into the actual impact of tariffs. Strap in, it could get bumpy."

      "text": "- President Donald Trump called on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign over national security concerns.\n- Crisis comms experts advise Intel to act swiftly and communicate on multiple fronts.\n- Intel's response team should involve legal, PR, and government affairs, one comms veteran said.\nYou can probably guess the type of day Lip-Bu Tan might be having.\nPresident Donald Trump took to social media Thursday to urge the Intel CEO to resign, after a Republican senator raised concerns about Tan's reported holdings in Chinese companies.\nOf all the challenges that CEOs, university presidents, and other leaders have to manage during the second Trump administration, drawing ire from the White House might be one of the most disconcerting.\nBusiness Insider spoke to crisis-communications practitioners to get their take on what leaders at Intel and beyond could do next. Here are four pieces of advice:\nMove swiftly\nKevin Donahue, a 30-year veteran of crisis comms, told Business Insider that Intel needs to get its message out on multiple fronts. Otherwise, he said, the chipmaker risks having the crisis grow.\n\"It's potentially fatal,\" Donahue said. \"You absolutely cannot stay mum in situations like this.\"\nHe added that beyond issuing a statement, the company's considerations need to include investors, customers, employees, and other elected officials. Intel also needs to game out various scenarios about what could happen next and how the story will play out on social media, where the tempest intensified Thursday following Trump's morning post on Truth Social.\n\"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,\" Trump wrote shortly after 7:30 a.m.\nIntel shares fell 3.1% Thursday. \"Intel, the Board of Directors, and Lip-Bu Tan are deeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with the President's America First agenda,\" said an Intel spokesperson in a statement to Business Insider.\nTan isn't the first leader Trump has criticized, but it is rare for the President to explicitly call for a CEO's resignation. He has, however, taken on the heads of major US law firms, university presidents, and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell in an effort to bring to heel institutions he believes don't align with his aims.\n\"President Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country's national and economic security,\" said a White House official in a statement to Business Insider. \"This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\"\nDraw a line in the sand\nMichele Ehrhart, who has worked in crisis comms for more than a decade and was VP of global communications at FedEx, told Business Insider that Intel needs to decide whether it's going to stand behind Tan. Once that decision is made, she said, the company should issue a statement explaining why it's doing so.\n\"You have to really draw a line in the sand on what it is you're trying to accomplish and how you're planning to do that,\" said Ehrhart, who is the author of the book \"Crisis Compass.\"\nShe said that could include putting a strong surrogate or, ideally, Tan himself, in front of a media outlet.\n\"That's what the CEO is there to do,\" Ehrhart said. \"They're your most important spokesperson.\"\nAt the same time, she said, it's possible to say too much and risk giving new life to the story. Ehrhart suggests an approach of, \"Here's our statement. We're not going to go beyond it.\"\nForm a team\nDonahue said that Intel should create a team comprised of the company's legal, government affairs, and PR departments, among others, to coordinate a response.\nEssentially, he said, the company needs to convince its stakeholders that the company and its board did their due diligence before they hired Tan in March, that they're supportive of him, and that any investments he might have don't present national security risks.\n\"That's a tall order,\" said Donahue, who is senior managing director of the Business and Corporate Communications group at Coologee, which focuses on brand transformations.\nCreate an offramp\nEvan Nierman, CEO of Red Banyan, a global crisis-communications firm, told Business Insider that there's a fundamental difference between how a company would handle being called out another by a high-profile individual versus Trump.\nIn the case of Trump, it's important to \"create an offramp\" by pulling \"all of the levers of power that are available to you,\" Nierman said. Engage with those around the president and convince him you want to be an ally, not an adversary, he said.\nIt might also make sense to appeal to what Nierman called Trump's \"transactional\" nature. Comb through the president's social-media posts and other statements to get a sense of what he might want to get him to back down, Nierman said.\nWith that approach, he said, \"you're going to have a lot more success than telling him no, ignoring him or trying to defend yourself.\"\nAugust 7, 2025 \u2014 This story has been updated to include a comment from Intel."

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. Financial institutions have engaged in unacceptable practices to restrict law-abiding individuals\u2019 and businesses\u2019 access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities. Some financial institutions participated in Government-directed surveillance programs targeting persons participating in activities and causes commonly associated with conservatism and the political right following the events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Federal Government suggested that such institutions flag individuals who made transactions related to companies like \u201cCabela\u2019s\u201d and \u201cBass Pro Shop\u201d or who made peer-to-peer payments that involved terms like \u201cTrump\u201d or \u201cMAGA,\u201d even though there was no specific evidence tying those individuals to criminal conduct.\nBank regulators have used supervisory scrutiny and other influence over regulated banks to direct or otherwise encourage politicized or unlawful debanking activities. \u201cOperation Chokepoint,\u201d for example, was a well-documented and systemic means by which Federal regulators pushed banks to minimize their involvement with individuals and companies engaged in lawful activities and industries disfavored by regulators based on factors other than individualized, objective, risk-based standards.\nAs a result, individuals, their businesses, and their families have been subjected to debanking on the basis of their political affiliations, religious beliefs or lawful business activities, and have suffered frozen payrolls, debt and crushing interest, and other significant harms to their livelihoods, reputations, and financial well-being. Such practices are incompatible with a free society and the principle that the provision of banking services should be based on material, measurable, and justifiable risks. Such practices, when wielded to discriminate against customers and businesses in credit transactions due to their religion, are also unlawful under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.). They further undermine public trust in banking institutions and their regulators, discriminate against political beliefs and free expression of those beliefs, and weaponize a politicized regulatory state.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States that no American should be denied access to financial services because of their constitutionally or statutorily protected beliefs, affiliations, or political views, and to ensure that politicized or unlawful debanking is not used as a tool to inhibit such beliefs, affiliations, or political views. Banking decisions must instead be made on the basis of individualized, objective, and risk-based analyses.\nSec. 3. Definitions. (a) The term \u201cpoliticized or unlawful debanking\u201d refers to an act by a bank, savings association, credit union, or other financial services provider to directly or indirectly adversely restrict access to, or adversely modify the conditions of, accounts, loans, or other banking products or financial services of any customer or potential customer on the basis of the customer\u2019s or potential customer\u2019s political or religious beliefs, or on the basis of the customer\u2019s or potential customer\u2019s lawful business activities that the financial service provider disagrees with or disfavors for political reasons.\n(b) The term \u201cFederal banking regulators\u201d refers to the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Federal member agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council with supervisory and regulatory authority over banks, savings associations, or credit unions.\nSec. 4. Removing Reputation Risk and Politicized or Unlawful Debanking. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, each appropriate Federal banking regulator shall, to the greatest extent permitted by law, remove the use of reputation risk or equivalent concepts that could result in politicized or unlawful debanking, as well as any other considerations that could be used to engage in such debanking, from their guidance documents, manuals, and other materials (other than existing regulations or other materials requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking) used to regulate or examine financial institutions over which they have jurisdiction. The removal of such concepts shall be made clear by each appropriate Federal banking regulator through formal guidance to their examiners. The Federal banking regulators shall also consider rescinding or amending existing regulations, consistent with applicable law, to eliminate or amend any regulations that could result in politicized or unlawful debanking and to ensure that any regulated firm\u2019s or individual\u2019s reputation is considered for regulatory, supervisory, banking, or enforcement purposes solely to the extent necessary to reach a reasonable and apolitical risk-based assessment.\n(b) The SBA shall, within 60 days of the date of this order, give notice to all financial institutions with which it guarantees loans under its lending programs, requiring that each financial institution that is subject to the SBA\u2019s jurisdiction and supervision:\n(i) within 120 days of the date of this order, makes reasonable efforts to identify and reinstate any previous clients of the institution or any subsidiaries denied service through a politicized or unlawful debanking action in violation of a statutory or regulatory requirement under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636) or any requirement in a Standard Operating Procedures Manual or Policy Notice related to a program or function of the Office of Capital Access, with notice of the reinstatement sent to the victim;\n(ii) within 120 days of the date of this order, identifies all potential clients denied access to financial services provided by the financial institution or any subsidiaries through a politicized or unlawful debanking action in violation of a statutory or regulatory requirement under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act or any requirement in a Standard Operating Procedures Manual or Policy Notice related to a program or function of the Office of Capital Access, and provides notice to each victim advising of the denied access and the renewed option to engage in such services previously denied; and\n(iii) within 120 days of the date of this order, identifies all potential clients denied access to payment processing services provided by the financial institution or any subsidiaries through a politicized or unlawful debanking action in violation of a statutory or regulatory requirement under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act or any requirement in a Standard Operating Procedures Manual or Policy Notice related to a program or function of the Office of Capital Access, and provides notice to each victim advising of the denied access and the renewed option to engage in such services previously denied.\nSec. 5. Scrutinizing Politicized or Unlawful Debanking. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, shall develop a comprehensive strategy for further measures to combat politicized or unlawful debanking activities of financial regulators and financial institutions across the Federal Government, including consideration of legislative or regulatory options to eliminate such debanking.\n(b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each Federal banking regulator shall conduct a review to identify financial institutions subject to its jurisdiction that have had any past or current, formal or informal, policies or practices that require, encourage, or otherwise influence such financial institution to engage in politicized or unlawful debanking and to take appropriate remedial action, to the extent authorized and consistent with applicable law, including levying fines, issuing consent decrees, or imposing other disciplinary measures against any financial institution subject to the jurisdiction of such Federal banking regulator that such Federal banking regulator finds has engaged in politicized or unlawful debanking that violates applicable law (including section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45), section 1031 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5531), and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act).\n(c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Federal banking regulators shall review their current supervisory and complaint data to identify any financial institution that has engaged in unlawful debanking on the basis of religion and, if such financial institution is unable to obtain compliance within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1691 and 1691e(g), refer such matters to the Attorney General for an appropriate civil action, as appropriate.\nSec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Small Business Administration.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nAugust 7, 2025."

      "text": "The Trump administration and congressional Republicans seem intent on peeling back some basic regulatory framework introduced by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. They argue that the burden on companies is too heavy and, by removing the regulations, corporations would be free to invest, expand, and grow the economy.\nThe arguments are understandable but ultimately unconvincing. For large corporations, the amounts they devote to compliance are proportionately trifling, and some of the biggest coherent additions to the regulatory framework happened at the start of what would become share increases in corporate profits.\nWhat Is On The Chopping Block?\nYou may have never heard of the PCAOB, or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It was part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a whiplash response to the dot-com implosion and the massive financial fraud by such companies as Enron, Adelphia, and WorldCom, that part of it.\nTo give a sense of how bad it was, in 2003, I wrote about the challenges replacement CEOs at such companies faced in trying to stabilize the businesses. One example was Bill Schleyer, an experienced executive and venture capitalist with an MBA from Harvard, who became chair and CEO of Adelphia Communications. He told me about his experience listening to the head of accounting talk about the previous management bookkeeping. \u201cI thought he was joking,\u201d Schleyer remembered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that anyone could be that Machiavellian to dream up those accounting practices.\u201d\nSarbanes-Oxley was unusual among many regulatory packages as it focused on financial reporting accuracy and executive accountability, according to Accountinginsights.org. That includes chief executive officers and chief financial officers signing off on the accuracy of financial statements. (There were many complaints from corporations at the time about the sign-off requirements. It\u2019s impossible to read people\u2019s minds, but perhaps an aversion of top executives to personal guarantees of produced information might have had something to do with it.)\nIt\u2019s not the first time people have tried to eliminate the PCAOB. The first Trump administration had undertaken a \u201cvirtual gutting,\u201d as Forbes contributor Robert G. Eccles wrote in 2021.\nWhy Major Regulations Are Important\nAccountingInsights notes that the PCAOB has had a positive impact by creating a \u201cshift towards a more rigorous and structured approach to auditing.\u201d The body has emphasized corporate internal controls and risk factors, \u201crequiring auditors to adopt a more analytical and skeptical mindset.\u201d\nThe quality of audits is of particular import for the public markets. They help ensure better information and transparency that investors, large and small, use to better their portfolios and strategies. The PCAOB announced in March 2025 the results of inspections in 2024. The aggregate deficiency rate of corporations audited by the six U.S. Global Network Firms dropped eight percentage points, from 34% in 2023 to 26% in 2024. The aggregate rate for the firms audited by the four largest firms dropped six percentage points from 26% in 2023 to 20%. Those Big Four firms audit about 80% of the market capitalization of public companies listed on exchanges.\nCompanies may complain about regulation, but contrary to their criticisms, regulations seem to help improve profits. Below is a graph from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. It shows pre-tax profitability of U.S. corporations at different times.\nThe gray bars are periods of recession. Notice how post-recession growth more or less continued a longer pre-recession trend until after the 2001 recession. As the country exited that period, growth in corporate profits shot upward at a quick pace. That started around when the U.S. passed Sarbanes-Oxley into law.\nAnother example is how the country came out of the Global Financial Crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was the regulatory reaction to the excesses and risky behavior that had just passed, was signed into law in 2010. At the same time, there was another sharp boost in corporate profits.\nThere is no way to show that Sarbanes-Oxley or Dodd-Frank was the cause of the profit growth spike after each, but it is clear that, at least, neither seemed to inhibit business.\nDr. Albert Schweitzer, the famous physician and humanitarian, was also a musical scholar and organist. In his two-volume biography of Johann Sebastian Bach, he discussed the difference between what he called objective art and subjective art. In music, he said that musicians who redefined forms and rules were subjective artists. By that, he meant they changed things around them to create. Bach, however, was, in Schweitzer\u2019s eyes, an objective artist. He followed strict rules that pushed him into himself where he worked around the restrictions to create things that had never been heard before.\nPerhaps financial regulation is similar. Corporate executives and boards want flexibility to do what they wish, but that doesn\u2019t focus innovation and strategy the way needed regulations did. Wiping away what has been successful is a mistake, no matter how many businesspeople want to eradicate constraints on themselves."

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the complex relationship between corporate regulation and profitability, emphasizing that while many executives oppose regulations, they often serve as necessary checks against corporate recklessness. It highlights recent actions by former President Trump, including demands for chip companies to pay a percentage of their revenue from sales to China and calls for the resignation of Intel's CEO over national security concerns. The piece argues that such unprecedented regulatory pressures can destabilize industries and negatively impact retirement funds, drawing parallels to historical instances of regulatory rollback that have led to financial crises.",
