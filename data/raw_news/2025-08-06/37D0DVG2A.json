  "content": "Gamers with older Macs who want to keep using Steam will need to upgrade to macOS Monterey or later if they can, as Valve is cutting support for macOS Big Sur in October.\n\nSteam is a mainstay of PC and Mac gaming, selling hundreds of thousands of games for multiple platforms. While it does operate a macOS storefront, it will be culling support for some users if they refuse to update their operating system.\n\nIn a Steam Support post, the Valve Software-operated store warns that it will officially stop supporting macOS 11 Big Sur on October 15, 2025. After that date, the Steam client won't run on that and earlier versions of macOS.\n\nThe company strongly encourages all Mac users to update to macOS 12 or later.\n\nThe reason for the update is due to Google Chrome, as Steam uses a heavily modified version of the browser, and that it doesn't work properly with older versions of macOS. Furthermore, Valve adds that Steam will require some macOS features and security updates available only in macOS 12 and later for future releases of the client.\n\nValve points out that Apple ended security updates and technical support for Big Sur in 2023, and that it would be beneficial to the user to regularly update their computers. It's warned that computers running older operating systems are susceptible to new malware and other exploits, which may never get patched.\n\nThis is not the first time Steam has warned of the end of support for older macOS versions. In 2023, it advised that a February 2024 update will stop support for macOS 10.13 High Sierra and 10.14 Mojave, after providing basic updates to the client to maintain the ability to play 32-bit games.\n\nIn June, Valve finally released a beta version of the Steam client that included native support for Apple Silicon.",

Features\n- macOS\n- Apps\n- M-series Processors\n- Intel\n- Magic Keyboard\n- Magic Mouse and Trackpad\n- Pro Display XDR\n- Studio Display\n- Thunderbolt\n- Touch Bar\n- 2. History\n- 3. 1984\n- 4.

Apple Silicon\nThe Mac is not a single computer but a lineup of models spanning laptops and desktops. It has been the center of Apple's successes for generations \u2014 from the first one released in 1984 to the one that saved the company from bankruptcy in 1998. Today, Apple's Mac lineup is used to develop apps for all of its platforms and remains essential to the ecosystem.\nThe transition to Apple Silicon breathed new life into the aging Mac platform thanks to the high speed and efficiency of the chipsets. Apple originally promised a two-year transition, but it took three years for the high-end desktop Macs to get Apple Silicon.\nM-series Mac models for sale\nMac Features\nPick up any Mac, and it will function the same as the others \u2014 with some caveats. Thanks to macOS, there will be little to no difference between how a desktop and a laptop perform. Much of the differences today lie in the processor type being used, not the machine's form factor.\nTouch ID is available on all modern Macs via either the built-in keyboard or an external Magic Keyboard sold by Apple. The Touch Bar has been retired and was used until the 13-inch MacBook Pro was discontinued in 2023.\nmacOS\nThe current version of macOS reflects Apple's decade of work trying to perfect the operating system. Mac OS X was the tenth iteration of the Mac operating system and debuted in 2001. The Mac OS X name stuck around for fifteen years but changed to macOS in 2016 to bring the naming scheme in line with Apple's other operating systems.\nThe OS stayed with 10.x versioning until 2020 when the shift to Apple Silicon and a foundational change in how specific systems were managed led to the version number increasing for the first time in a decade. macOS Big Sur was the first to buck the trend as it was version 11. The 2021 operating system release was macOS Monterey 12.0, followed by macOS Ventura 13.0, then macOS Sonoma 14.0, and now macOS Sequoia 15.0.\nThe Unix-based operating system should be instantly familiar to anyone who has interacted with a Mac in the past. Graphic elements and features change over time, but the overall layout and interaction schemes remained relatively the same. Opening an app would create an app instance in a window. However, closing a window would not close the app but rather leave it running in the background. The traffic light icons control the window management.\nThe most significant user-facing changes in recent years have revolved around security and bringing the desktop closer to iOS design paradigms. Windows have rounded corners now, apps use sidebars for navigation, and app permissions are more robust than ever.\nThe blend between iOS and macOS hit its peak with macOS Tahoe 26, which introduced Liquid Glass to the platform. The material is meant to emulate the transparent characteristics of visionOS.\nApps\nWhile the Mac went through its two-year transition to Apple Silicon, it used a program called Rosetta 2 that translated Intel-based Apps on the fly. This process is so efficient that the M1 Macs can run some Intel apps better than premium Intel Macs.\nUltimately, Rosetta 2 is only a stopgap that Apple will remove in future updates \u2014 developers are expected to transition their apps to Apple Silicon or be left behind. Rosetta 2 is still available in macOS Sonoma.\nAll of Apple's apps have already been written for the ARM, so Final Cut Pro and Logic work at full speed on the new machines.\nWhile Apple continues to push users to the Mac App Store, apps can still be downloaded directly from the web. Some apps require some additional security hoops to jump through, but still work.\nM-series Processors\nApple released its first three Macs with an M-series processor at the end of 2020. The 13-inch MacBook Pro, the M1 MacBook Air, and the Mac Mini. The processor was an immediate success, with users noting performance gains and quality-of-life improvements across the board.\nThe first iteration, the M1, is what Apple says the company can do when it brings its processor expertise to the Mac without much effort. The first machines are identical in every way to their Intel counterparts except for the processor.\nWith the release of the 2021 MacBook Pros, Apple announced the M1 Pro and M1 Max. These processors take the magic of the M1 even further with 10-core processors and up to 32-core GPUs. Very few Intel-based machines are able to compete in pure computing power.\nApple announced the M1 Ultra for use in the Mac Studio during a 2022 March event. It is the last M1 processor variant in the lineup and is expected to be included in a Mac Pro update later in 2022.\nThe M2 processor was announced during WWDC 2022 alongside an M2 MacBook Air and a processor bump in the 13-inch MacBook Pro. It is a slightly more powerful processor and a direct successor to the M1.\nThe M2 Pro and M2 Max were revealed in January 2023 and included in a spec-bumped MacBook Pro lineup. The Mac mini also gained the M2 and M2 Pro, widening its range of usability and performance greatly.\nDuring WWDC 2023 in June, the M2 Ultra was revealed. It is available in the Mac Studio and Mac Pro.\nContinuing the blistering pace, Apple released the M3 family of chips all at once in October 2023 \u2014 M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips launched in the 24-inch iMac and the MacBook Pro.\nApple revealed M4 with the iPad Pro in early 2024 and brought the chip to Mac in October. A redesigned smaller Mac mini got the M4 and M4 Pro, while the iMac was updated with M4.\nM4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max were included in the new MacBook Pro lineup. Little else changed in the spec update beyond a brighter displays, Thunderbolt 5 in high end models, and a Nano Texture option.\nThe Mac Studio and Mac Pro were skipped over in 2024 as Apple seemed intent on skipping over M3 Ultra. The 3nm process used for M3 is undesirable, so Apple quickly moved the lineup to M4.\nHowever, Apple did update the Mac Studio with M4 Max in 2025, but it did not reveal an M4 Ultra. Instead, the top-tier Mac Studio uses M3 Ultra and no M4 Ultra has been revealed.\nIntel\nApple cut off Intel entirely at the beginning of the Apple Silicon transition. Intel has had years of near-identical processor bumps with little user-facing improvements along the way. This led Apple to jump to internally-designed processors to ensure Mac's future was in its full control.\nWith each new M-series processor and Mac using it, Apple cut out more and more Intel machines from the lineup. After the M2 Ultra made it into Mac Pro, Apple no longer sells Intel models.\nSome Intel-based machines are still for sale at non-Apple distributors, but they will sell out eventually. The Intel-based Mac mini, for example, is now considered obsolete.\nMagic Keyboard\nApple refers to multiple products as the Magic Keyboard, but when discussing Macs, it applies to two \u2014 the built-in MacBook keyboards and the wireless keyboard. The new built-in Magic Keyboard uses scissor-switch mechanisms to ensure the keys function correctly with each press.\nApple tried using a \"butterfly\" mechanism in its MacBook keyboards, but this proved to be a reliability disaster. Users reported that keys would stick or fail regularly, so Apple finally reverted to the scissor switch, but with a new slimmer design.\nApple's wireless keyboards all use the old scissor-switch mechanism but remain thin and light despite the aging design. The external Mac desktop keyboards were updated with Touch ID and colors that match the 24-inch iMac, but little was changed about the overall shape and layout.\nMagic Mouse and Trackpad\nApple's trackpad has always been ahead of the competition in terms of reliability and usefulness. The Magic Mouse, however, is a bit of an anomaly.\nThe Magic Trackpad can connect via Bluetooth or a USB-C cable and uses taptic engines to simulate a click. The entire surface of the trackpad is \"clickable\" and doesn't physically move when pressed. The taptic engine vibrates during operation to fool users into thinking the device actually clicked.\nThe Magic Mouse is a small classically-designed mouse that uses touch-sensitive glass for input. Rather than having traditional mouse buttons, the entire top front of the mouse is clickable, and each side can recognize when pressed to simulate right and left clicks. Instead of a scroll wheel, the Magic Mouse uses a touch surface that users can swipe on.\nThe Magic Mouse is controversial because it can only be used over Bluetooth and charges via USB-C when upside-down. The port placement was an obvious form-over-function choice from an \"old Apple\" that wanted the mouse to look seamless \u2014 even at the detriment of usefulness.\nPro Display XDR\nApple may have said it is out of the display business, but it revealed the Pro Display XDR alongside the Mac Pro in 2019. This 6K display has been calibrated to represent near-perfect color and contrast representation when showing images. Apple says it is competitive with $24K reference monitors used by film professionals.\nCustomers can add a nano-texture to the display for an additional $1,000. Controversially the monitor doesn't come with a stand. Customers must choose between an expensive VESA adapter or a $1,000 stand.\nThe Pro Display XDR results from Apple's desire to achieve perfection and features a price to match. Some rumors speculate that Apple is planning on more consumer-friendly monitors in the future.\nStudio Display\nApple introduced the Studio Display as a companion to the Mac Studio. It is a 27-inch 5K display with True Tone and P3 color. It connects via Thunderbolt 3 and integrates with macOS features like Spatial Audio and Center Stage.\nThis new monitor runs an A13 for audio, microphone, and camera processing. It works with modern Intel Macs, all M-series Macs, and the latest iPads with the M1 processor.\nThe 27-inch iMac was discontinued after the Studio Display was announced. It isn't clear if Apple could still revive the product at a later date with Apple Silicon.\nThunderbolt\nApple uses Intel's Thunderbolt spec across all of its Mac computers. M1 Macs use Thunderbolt/USB-4 connectors while the M1 Pro/M1 Max MacBook Pros use Thunderbolt 4.\nThunderbolt 4 allows up to 100W of power and 40GB/s of data over a single USB-C cable and is fully backward compatible with previous cable specs. The spec also allows multiple Thunderbolt devices to be chained together to maximize the one connection's utility.\nThe M1-based Macs have some limitations when using Thunderbolt, however. Users can only connect one external monitor via a Thunderbolt connection and cannot use e-GPUs. The monitor support is expected to increase in future iterations of the M-series processor, but e-GPU support may never come.\nThe 2021 and later MacBook Pros can connect multiple external displays thanks to improvements with the included Thunderbolt controllers.\nM4 Macs can connect to two 6K external displays, or three in the case of the Mac mini. The high end Mac mini and MacBook Pros have three Thunderbolt 5 ports.\nTouch Bar\nThe Touch Bar is an OLED strip that appeared at the top of old MacBook Pro models. It replaced the function row keys as a new variable input device for certain apps. Apple had iterated slightly on the Touch Bar design, like re-introducing a physical escape key, but little else changed over the years.\nThe Touch Bar had been neglected in software too. Apple paid little attention to the hardware when updating macOS or its apps, and third parties have mostly ignored it as well.\nApple originally introduced the Touch Bar as a new interaction paradigm that would give pro users a new way to interact with apps. It offered a novel way to scrub timelines or switch between tools in certain apps but left a lot to be desired otherwise. The lack of haptics and accidental touches made the Touch Bar more of a nuisance for some users than a boon.\nWith the release of the 2021 MacBook Pros, Apple removed the Touch Bar in favor of full-sized function keys. The company didn't bother to mention the Touch Bar once during the announcement, signaling its demise.\nIt survived in only one model thanks to a lack of redesign \u2014 the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Apple discontinued that model in 2023, thus finally killing the Touch Bar entirely.\nHistory of the Mac\nThe Mac began in 1979 with Jef Raskin, initially Apple's 31st employee and taken on as Manager of Publications. Having broad experience in computing and regularly using what he called his \"honorary beanbag chair\" at Xerox PARC, he knew about its graphical user interfaces (GUIs) before Steve Jobs did.\nRaskin consequently wanted a graphical bitmapped screen for a computer, but he also had very many more aims for what he saw as the future of the technology. Sometime around March 1979, he lobbied then Apple chairman Mike Markkula to begin a project he initially called \"Annie,\" but later renamed Macintosh.\nFar more than some verbal pitch or vague request to work on a new project, Raskin wrote up an entire set of papers that he ultimately called \"The Book of Macintosh.\" The complete text, now available online, ranges from an \"Annie\" memo of May 1979 to a \"January 1980 Overall Summary.\"\nRight from the start, though, the core aim was to make a computer that was simple to use.\n\"This is an outline for a computer designed for the Person In The Street (or, to abbreviate: the PITS),\" wrote Raskin. \"[One] that will be truly pleasant to use, that will require the user to do nothing that will threaten his or her perverse delight in being able to say: 'I don't know the first thing about computers, and one which will be profitable to sell, service and provide software for.\nWhen he first proposed \"Annie\" \u2013\u2013 what he really thought would eventually be called the Apple V \u2013\u2013 Raskin knew that the company was developing the Apple Lisa. However, Raskin predicted that the Lisa would be \"overpriced and too slow.\"\nSo as well as a computer for the Person in the Street, he wanted it to be affordable. Raskin's plan was for a computer that cost $500, ran on the low-cost Motorola 6809 processor \u2013\u2013 and did not include a mouse.\nThat lack of a mouse, and so the lack of being able to point and click, means that Raskin may not have envisaged the kind of GUI that we now imagine. At the same time, the Apple Lisa may not have always been planned to have a GUI \u2013\u2013 until Steve Jobs saw one at Xerox PARC.\nJef Raskin and Steve Jobs did not get along, but Raskin wanted Jobs to see the work being done at PARC. He called on Bill Atkinson, a principal designer of the Lisa and Mac GUIs, to talk Jobs into visiting Xerox.\nThe famous visits to PARC in November and December 1979 ultimately led to the Macintosh, but initially, they transformed the Apple Lisa. That project now definitely had to have a GUI, and if Steve Jobs had stayed with the Lisa, Jef Raskin might have got his simple, cheap Macintosh.\nHowever, Jobs reportedly antagonized people enough that Apple's then-president Michael Scott removed him from the Lisa project. Jobs then decided to take over Macintosh and effectively make it better than the Lisa.\nThis did push Raskin aside, which lead him to leave the project in summer 1981. However, his overall ethos of simplicity, and especially of it being an appliance, stayed. \"The computer must be one lump,\" Raskin had written. \"Seeing the guts is taboo.\"\nThe low cost, though, and everything that contributed to that did not stay. Raskin formed the Macintosh team, but it was because of Jobs that the Mac ran on the more costly Motorola 68000 and that it got a mouse.\n1984 - The Macintosh debuts\nBy the time it was launched, Raskin's $500 Macintosh had become Jobs's $2,495 one. Some of that was due to then-CEO John Sculley wanting to make back Apple's considerable spending on advertising.\nMuch of it, though, was Steve Jobs pressing for better components and a better experience for the user. Despite being willing to do that even as it pushed the price up, though, Jobs was not willing to do it enough. The Mac that launched in 1984 was underpowered.\nIt was also a flop. It changed the world \u2013\u2013 truly \u2013\u2013 but that original Mac did not change Apple. At least, not at first. For its initial several years, the Mac and Apple were supported by the high sales of the Apple II.\nThat machine faded away as the original Macintosh became the \"Fat Mac,\" with double the RAM, in September 1984. Then in 1987, came the Macintosh II and the Macintosh SE.\nThese initial successors just addressed shortcomings in the original Mac. That ranged from the lack of RAM to how it initially only ran in black and white.\nThen in January 1989, Apple launched the upgraded Macintosh SE/30. And in 1990, it brought out the \"wicked fast\" Macintosh IIfx. While other models were popular, and some like the IIci are fondly remembered, these two were arguably the workhorses of the Mac range.\nThe early 1990s \u2014 from innovation to complication with Centris, Quadra, and Performa\nSteve Jobs was long gone by the time the SE/30 and IIfx were beloved. His time away from Apple is perhaps more remembered now, though, for what happened next with the Macintosh.\nThe answer is simultaneously a lot and not very much. The Mac grew steadily more capable and steadily more successful in the late '80s, including the over-engineered but significant Macintosh Portable in 1989.\nUnfortunately, the Mac started to become only a little more capable, and it steadily became less successful in the early '90s.\nApple decided to provide a model of Mac at every possible price point and for every conceivable type of customer. Businesses got the Macintosh Quadra range from 1991 and the Macintosh Centris models from 1992, but both were gone by 1995.\nConsumers got the Macintosh Performa range, which lasted from 1992 to 1997, but these were just renamed versions of the Quadra, Centris, and LC models. They were given new names, a plethora of marketing model numbers based on starting specs, some cosmetic differences. Then they were sold through big-box stores such as Sears, Service Merchandise, and just about anywhere else that had a pulse and a sufficiently large retail footprint.\nOr rather, they weren't. The Performa range, with its dozens of different configurations and models, sold poorly.\nHowever, the two bright spots in this period were the PowerBook range, from 1991, and the transition from 68000 processors to the PowerPC from 1994.\nPowerBooks were the \"Mac in a book\" that Steve Jobs had been pressing for from the start, and their design completely transformed laptops. They moved the keyboard to the back, meaning users' palms rested on the machine instead of awkwardly hanging over the edge. Every single laptop since has copied this.\nSimilarly, the PowerBook Macs later introduced the trackpad, and practically every laptop since then has followed along.\nEven with the PowerBook range's success, though, and the move to PowerPC, Apple struggled because it was spread very thin.\nThe late 1990s - Jobs returns\nApple was trying to get an updated Mac OS off the ground alongside countless indistinguishable Mac models. With years of effort having nothing to show for it, eventually, Apple began to look at buying in an alternative from outside the company \u2013\u2013 and it did.\nApple bought the basis of what would become OS X, but it also brought back Steve Jobs. Apple bought Jobs's failing NeXT Computer in 1996.\n\"This is a complementary arrangement,\" then-CEO Gil Amelio said at the time, \"The pieces fit together better than any alternative we looked at, and it will launch a new round of technology.\"\nIn the long term, Amelio would prove to be correct. But in the short term, he found himself out of a job. It wasn't that Steve Jobs took over \u2013\u2013 not at first. Instead, it was the fortunes of Apple that kept on declining, at one point requiring the laying off of 3,000 employees.\nThere were also public-facing debacles such as Amelio, presenting at Macworld and entirely forgetting to introduce the guest of honor Muhammad Ali. Behind the scenes, Oracle tried and failed to make a hostile takeover bid for Apple \u2013\u2013 and it was later revealed that Jobs had supported it.\nOn July 4, 1997, Apple's board told Gil Amelio he was no longer wanted. He officially resigned as CEO on July 9. Steve Jobs was actually put in charge of finding a replacement, and after a few months, became the interim CEO himself.\n\"I couldn't even figure out the damn product line after a few weeks,\" Steve Jobs then said in September 1997. \"I kept saying what is this model, how does this fit? I started talking to customers and they couldn't figure it out either, and so you're gonna see the product line get much simpler and you're gonna see the product line get much better.\"\nJobs' iMac saved Apple\nJobs came in As interim CEO, and then fully the CEO, Jobs sought to save Apple from bankruptcy and did so initially with the Macintosh. Working with Apple designer Jony Ive, Jobs created the iMac.\nAnnounced in 1998, 14 years after the original Macintosh, the new iMac was visually striking, and introduced new technologies that the rest of the industry then emulated.\nIt also introduced new colors so that the Mac was no longer a kind of yellowing beige, and instead was vivid Bondi Blue, and more. \"The one thing Apple is providing now is leadership in colors,\" Bill Gates said in 1998. \"It won't take long for us to catch up with that, I don't think.\"\nThat was an example of Gates missing a point because, as Jobs later said, \"the only problem with Microsoft is that they have no taste.\" Where Gates saw color as a quick paint job, Apple saw design as being about everything from how something looked to how it was used.\nSo alongside its painted exterior, the iMac brought approachability. Jef Raskin had wanted his Macintosh to have a handle, and the iMac still had one. Maybe you never picked it up, but it always felt as if you could, so it seemed lighter than it was, it seemed approachable.\nThen it also introduced USB to the wider world. True, the iMac used that technology in the iMac's \"hockey puck\" mouse, and that was excruciatingly poor. But it brought USB into the mainstream, and rival manufacturers soon fell into the now-familiar pattern of mocking an Apple decision, then copying it.\nIn 1999, Jobs took the iMac ideas and put them into the iBook. It had similar bright colors, it had a handle, but it also had Wi-Fi. It was the first consumer notebook to have Wi-Fi built-in, and Jobs demonstrated that as if he were a magician, loading up internet pages with no visible wires.\nApple, Intel, and the late '00s\nThe iMac and the iBook saved Apple, and then from 2001, it did seem as if the company went iPod-mad. That music player became an incredible source of revenue for Apple, and it also introduced Apple to very many users.\nPlenty of those users then learned about the Mac, and consequently, its share of the market rose. But with more people using the Mac came more demands on it, and the PowerPC processor was not keeping up.\nSo in 2005, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was going to undertake another transition, this time from PowerPC to Intel.\n\"Why are we going to do this?\" he said. \"Didn't we just get through going from OS 9 to OS X? Isn't the business great right now? Why do we want another transition? Because we want to make the best computers for our customers going forward.\"\nMoving to Intel gave the Macintosh a boost it could not have got from PowerPC. Although it tied Apple to Intel's schedule of releases, it also enabled ever more powerful Macs, including the iMac Pro.\nMac Pro and consumer Macs\nWhen it launched in 2017, the iMac Pro was praised but seen as a stopgap while Apple worked on a revised Mac Pro. Very unusually, the company had even said that it was working on one \u2013\u2013 and it did so because, at this point, the Mac Pro was languishing.\nOriginally introduced as the top-end Mac for power users in 2006, the \"cheese grater\" machine that evolved from the PowerMac G5, had hit its limits long before the range was replaced in late 2013. That December 2013 Mac Pro was the cylindrical \"trash can\" model and it failed, mostly because Apple didn't predict the increasing focus on GPU power versus CPU.\nIt was gorgeous to look at, but unlike its predecessor, it had barely any expandability. Apple would later say that thermal issues in its design limited it.\nWhat it looked to the outside world, and most particularly to power user creatives, was that Apple was focusing more on consumers. It was, too, with the iPhone, and then to a lesser extent the iPad, becoming what Apple was known for.\nBy 2015, there were eighteen iPhone users for every individual Mac user, and this number has only grown since. Of course, the company served its new core audience \u2013\u2013 but the old core audience was drifting away.\nHence the 2017 iMac Pro, then the 2019 Mac Pro. The 2019 Mac Pro was the most expensive Mac in decades, surpassed only by the IIfx, and it could be expanded at a cost greater than all but the most pro users could contemplate.\nApple was telling the power users that the Mac was back. It just very shortly afterward told them the Mac was changing.\nNext stop, Apple Silicon\nDespite the extremely high performance of the 2019 Mac Pro, being tied to Intel was limiting how much Apple could do when Intel itself was not sticking to its own development plans. Intel processors, as a whole, were hitting limits that Apple needed to exceed.\nCustomers could see the limitations and the delays, so of course, Apple could as well. In 2020, Tim Cook announced the long-rumored, much-awaited next transition.\nThe Mac in 2020 would still follow Jef Raskin's aim of being the simplest computer to use, but it is the Apple Silicon M1 processor that would be unrecognizably fast. That's unrecognizably faster than anyone from Raskin's time could imagine, but also faster than even present-day Intel users could.\nAfter releasing the M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, and M1 Ultra, Apple introduced the M2, restarting the cycle anew. M2 Pro and M2 Max followed in early 2023, with the M2 Ultra arriving later in June.\nM3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max were announced in October 2023 with even more improvements. They are the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac built on the 3nm process.\nM4 arrived in the Mac in October 2024. The M4 Pro was revealed with the redesigned Mac mini while the M4 is used in the base Mac mini and iMac. M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max are available in the MacBook Pros, which also have brighter displays with optional Nano Texture.\nThe M4 Ultra is due in the Mac Studio and Mac Pro in the summer of 2025. The M5 processor should debut before the end of 2025 in select Macs."

While much of the focus was on the sleek new interface it would be standardizing across its platforms, it still found a bit of time to mention gaming on Mac.\nA new app called Apple Games will give players a one-stop-shop for gaming on their devices. It includes both Apple Arcade games and third-party games, as well as new Play Together features and a dedicated Library tab.\nWe also learned that macOS Tahoe will introduce Metal 4, bringing more advanced graphics and improved rendering technologies to games. This includes MetalFX Frame Interpolation and MetalFX Denoising, for smoother visuals and faster frame rates.\nApple announced the following games set to roll for macOS Tahoe:\n- Crimson Desert\n- InZOI\n- Cyberpunk 2077\n- Cronos: The New Dawn\n- Architect: Land of Exile\n- Lies of P: Overture\n- HITMAN World of Assassination\n- EVE Frontier\n- Where Winds Meet\nThe list is hardly, exhaustive, though. At the least, we know a few other games are coming to Mac in the future. Recently, we learned that Sniper Elite 5 will make its debut to Mac, iPhone, and iPad in the first quarter of 2026.\nFor a second year in a row, Dead Island 2 has been featured as part of the WWDC Games hype graphic \u2014 but there's still no word on a release date.

      "text": "macOS Monterey\n-\nActive Discussions\nLooks like there's nothing here yet. Why not be the first?\nAll about macOS Monterey\nTable of Contents\nApple introduced macOS Monterey at WWDC 2021 with several new features that bring further parity across iOS and macOS. In addition, as the Apple Silicon transition continues into its second year, macOS got a few updates to bring even more iOS favorites to the platform.\nThe line between Apple devices continues to blur as operating system features cause each device to work together. This is more true than ever with macOS 12 with features like Universal Control, SharePlay, and AirPlay to Mac.\nmacOS Ventura\nApple announced macOS Ventura during WWDC 2022 as the next operating system version that replaces macOS 12. It has all new features, including Stage Manager, a new take on windowed multitasking.\nThat release was followed by macOS Sonoma in 2023.\nmacOS Monterey Features\nMany of the features announced for iOS 15 are present in macOS, thanks to Apple's commitment to keeping the ecosystem in sync. There was a significant focus on social and health-related features that keep users in touch or block out the noise with new Do Not Disturb modes.\nUniversal Control\nOne of the most noteworthy features unveiled at WWDC 2021 is Universal Control. It uses a combination of features to enable multiple devices to work in tandem automatically.\nThis is a macOS Monterey feature, so you need a Mac to initiate Universal Control. Place a second Mac or an iPad near the first Mac and move your mouse cursor to the edge of the display. The UI will appear as a small bar showing the cursor moving from one device to another.\nOnce initial pairing is done, a user can move the cursor freely between the multiple devices as if they were the same machine \u2014 one mouse and keyboard can control them all.\nNot only is the cursor moving between devices, but drag and drop works as well. Grab an image or a file on your iPad and drag it to the Mac without effort.\nThis feature is possible thanks to existing technologies and continuity features. That means any Mac running macOS Monterey and iPad running iPadOS 15 will be able to take advantage of Universal Control.\nApple says the devices use proximity to determine which device a user wants to connect. The user's behavior will determine which side of the display the additional computer has been placed on. This can be changed in System Preferences in the Displays menu.\nThe devices connect via a direct Wi-Fi signal. The UI of dragging objects across devices disguises the fact you're performing a simple AirDrop, but the result is the same.\nShortcuts on Mac\nAutomation has always been possible on the Mac, but it had a learning curve many wouldn't bother to overcome. With Shortcuts on Mac, users will be able to set up, share, and use automation easier than ever.\nApple's move to replace Automator with Shortcuts has been a long time coming. However, new Shortcut actions have been added to help with the transition, enabling Automator actions to be directly imported into Shortcuts.\nThere are several ways to get a shortcut without ever touching the editor for users just looking to get something done. There is a Shortcuts gallery that Apple manages with many example Shortcuts inside. Users can also share Shortcuts via links, so if a savvy friend builds a tool you want, they can share it.\nShortcuts are simple to build, and Apple has added some algorithm magic to suggest what a next step might include to help you even further. Once a Shortcut is created, users can set them to the Menu Bar or automatically run one.\nThere are device-specific actions to ask Shortcuts to check which device is running the Shortcut before executing, enabling branching actions based on what can be done on that machine. While Shortcuts on Mac isn't perfect, it is a good first step to revolutionizing automation on the platform.\nQuick Note\nA new feature of macOS and iPadOS is Quick Note. Users can open a Notes app dialog anywhere in the operating system and annotate what they are viewing.\nDevelopers can implement Quick Note in their app so that a link back to that area of the app can be generated when one is opened. A floating indicator will show up in apps where Quick Notes have been made.\nQuick Notes sync across iOS, macOS, and iPadOS within the Notes app. Users can add links, images, or text within the note body like regular notes.\nOther new Notes app features include tags and shared note activity views. See every change to a shared note in a timeline and tag other users within a note using an @ symbol.\nThe Quick Notes feature is optimized for iPad, but it still works on Mac. Placing your cursor in the lower right corner of your active display will bring up the Quick Note UI, but activating it just opens a new Notes app window.\nAirPlay to Mac\nThe ability to send media from a Mac to an AirPlay device has been around for a while, though Macs themselves couldn't be targeted as a receiver. With AirPlay to Mac, users can play audio and video from their devices to a Mac and take advantage of the display or connected speakers.\nMacs have great displays that show content better than a tiny phone display, from Retina MacBooks to the lofty Pro Display XDR. Rather than navigating to a piece of content on the Mac itself, users can send the video or audio to the Mac directly via AirPlay.\nThis feature is an extension of Apple's push for more social interactions. As described below, SharePlay will let users view a video shared to their iMac display while on a FaceTime call with friends.\nFocus\nRather than have a blanket Do Not Disturb command that shuts the world out, Focus offers users a granular control to let some apps or people in depending on the moment. Focus can be set up for work, personal, or driving, as an example.\nFocus can be scheduled for a time of day or set manually via Control Center. Once a Focus is set on one device, the same Focus is enabled across all devices via iCloud sync.\nWhen setting up a Focus, users can enable status notifications in iMessage for that Focus. When enabled, iMessage users will see a message saying notifications won't reach the recipient unless it is an emergency.\nUsers select which apps can send notifications during a Focus, like Slack on a work Focus. Other notifications are collected in a group for reviewing after a Focus ends.\nApp updates across macOS Monterey\nApple updated many of its core apps during WWDC 2021. These app updates affect the app on every platform with new features and designs.\nFaceTime\nThe pandemic spurred Apple's renewed focus on social features. FaceTime takes on new design language and features inherited from other popular video apps like Zoom.\nUsers can set a grid view rather than seeing Apple's floating square format. A white box will appear around the speaker's square to emphasize who is talking.\nAudio can be filtered so the microphone only picks up the sound of the speaker, not whatever may be happening in the background, like fan noise or a vacuum. A wide-spectrum audio setting is also available for that moment when you're trying to show off how a keyboard sounds on a call.\nPortrait mode from photos has been enhanced for calls. Now you'll be able to blur the background and increase the focus on your face. The M1 processor can quickly keep track of your outline and reduce errors in the algorithm for blurring.\nApple has also opened FaceTime up to users outside of the Apple ecosystem. Apple users can generate links to a FaceTime call and share it with Android or Windows users. Calls on other platforms will take place via the web, similar to Zoom.\niMessage\nApple's most significant change to the Messages app is under the surface \u2014 new intelligence for sharing items. When links, images, or other media are shared with you via iMessage, the system displays it in other locations.\nFor example, a friend can share a song via iMessage, then in Apple Music, a \"Shared With You\" section will show the song. You'll no longer need to manage the media yourself or dive through message history to find the media.\nOther apps taking advantage of this feature include Safari, Apple News, Apple TV, and Photos.\nApple also improved the photo-sharing experience in iMessage with photo stacks. A group of photos sent at once is shown in an interactive stack that can be swiped through or opened.\nSharePlay\nSharePlay is a social experience baked into FaceTime. Now users can watch movies or listen to music during a call.\nSee your friends on screen as you watch a video, or AirPlay the video to an Apple TV while keeping the FaceTime call active on the Mac. The video or audio will sync across all participants so everyone can react at the same time.\nThird-party apps can tap into the SharePlay API, so soon, FaceTime participants will be able to view TikTok or YouTube during the call.\nSafari\nSafari has an all-new look with tabs occupying the same space as the address bar. The page's content can influence the background color of the entire UI to make the tab bar blend in with the webpage.\nUsers can open multiple tabs in a group then save that group in a new organization system. Rather than have hundreds of open tabs occupying a window, save sets of tabs as groups to open them later.\nTab Groups sync across devices, so they are easily accessed wherever you are. This new tool lives in the sidebar, along with bookmarks and the reading list.\nLive Text and Photos\nImages across macOS Monterey display a new tool when text is found in the picture. Using content recognition algorithms, users can select text and interact with it directly within a photo.\nSpotlight will also surface text found in images throughout the user's photo library. When found, addresses and phone numbers are also presented as rich links within images.\nmacOS Monterey Compatibility\nMac Desktops:\n- iMac Pro (2017)\n- M1 iMac (Retina 4.5K, 24-inch, 2021)\n- iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2020)\n- iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2019)\n- iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, 2019)\n- iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017)\n- iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, 2017)\n- iMac (21.5-inch, 2017)\n- iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)\n- iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, Late 2015)\n- iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2015)\n- Mac mini (M1, 2020)\n- Mac mini (2018)\n- Mac mini (Late 2014)\n- Mac Pro (2019)\n- Mac Pro (Late 2013)\nMacBook Pro:\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\n- MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\nMacBook Air:\n- MacBook Air (M1, 2020)\n- MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2020)\n- MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2019)\n- MacBook Air (Retina, 13-inch, 2018)\n- MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017)\n- MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015)\n- MacBook Air (11-inch, Early 2015)\nMacBook (12-inch):\n- MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, 2017)\n- MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2016)"

It hosts thousands of games and is the most popular place to get video games on computers.\nMacs may not be known for gaming, but it's always been possible to run many titles, even from Steam. However, Steam is ending support for older versions of macOS as of February 15, 2024.\nFrom Steam's statement:\nAs of February 15th, 2024, Steam will officially stop supporting the macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and 10.14 (Mojave) operating systems. After that date, existing Steam Client installations on these operating systems will no longer receive updates of any kind including security updates. Steam Support will be unable to offer users technical support for issues related to the old operating systems, and Steam will be unable to guarantee continued functionality of Steam on the unsupported operating system versions.\nApple stopped supporting macOS High Sierra in 2020 and macOS Mojave in 2021.

Transition\n- Universal 2\n- Rosetta 2\n- Virtualization\nApple Silicon doesn't refer to a specific chipset or processor but to the company's custom silicon as a whole. Its development lets the company focus on performance and vertical integration across platforms rather than needing to optimize software to work with another company's hardware.\nThe custom processors developed by Apple have benefitted iPhone and iPad for years. The Mac began using them in 2020.\nFollowing more than a decade of chip architecture experience gleaned from developing the A-series processors, Apple prepared the way for Apple Silicon on Mac with macOS Big Sur, Mac Catalyst, and several other developer platforms.\nIt took the next step for more vertical integration with the C1 modem in iPhone 16e. Ultimately, Apple is expected to ditch Qualcomm modems in favor of its in-house solution.\nApple Silicon Ecosystem\nApple made its first custom processors out of necessity because Intel did not want to design chips for the iPhone. Because of this, Apple built custom processors for the iPhone, ensuring complete vertical integration with the software.\nThe A-series chips went on to become the most powerful and efficient mobile chipsets available at the time, and Qualcomm and even Intel could not keep up. Now the Mac has M-series chips pushing beyond what was possible when running Intel on the Mac.\nM4: Apple Intelligence at its core\nApple introduced the M4 processor alongside redesigned 13-inch iPad Pro and 11-inch iPad Pro. It is built on the 3-nanometer process with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU.\nThe Neural Engine got an upgrade with a focus on Apple Intelligence. It jumps to 38 trillion operations per second.\nM4 is also included in the Mac mini, iMac, and base MacBook Pro. Mac mini also uses the M4 Pro.\nM4 Pro and M4 Max were introduced in the MacBook Pro. Mac Studio also uses M4 Max and can be upgraded to M3 Ultra.\nM3: More than a third-generation spec bump\nWhen Apple transitioned to Apple Silicon, it did so when the world's supply chain was upended by global instability and a pandemic. Product launches seemed to stretch out on a longer pattern than what Apple wanted, but it seems with M3 the cycle has achieved regularity.\nThe M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max were all revealed by Apple simultaneously during the \"Scary Fast\" event in October 2023. The chips were announced alongside refreshed MacBook Pros and the M3 24-inch iMac.\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro replaced the 13-inch MacBook Pro on the low end with a base M3 model. External designs were unchanged for the upgraded 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nApple released the M3 MacBook Air models in March 2024. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch options were updated at the same time.\nThe M3 family of processors are built with the 3-nanometer process. They have features like Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, and faster processing cores.\nRumors suggest that Apple has no plans to release an M3 Ultra since the M4 was revealed in May 2024 for the iPad Pro update. No Mac Studio or Mac Pro updates were revealed during WWDC in June 2024.\nM2: The second generation of Apple Silicon\nThe M2 is around 18% faster than the M1 it replaces, has 25% more transistors, and can be configured with up to 10 GPU cores. It was announced for the 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro first, then brought to other products like iPad Pro and the 15-inch MacBook Air.\nIt has the Media Engine, which wasn't introduced in the first generation until the M1 Pro. That means developing video and other media is much faster on an M2 machine when using optimized software.\nJust like with the M1, the M2 Pro and M2 Max followed and are used in the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac Studio. Finally, the M2 Ultra was revealed during WWDC 2023 and is used in the Mac Studio and Mac Pro.\nApple introduced two iPad Air models with the M2 processor in May 2024.\nM1: The Mac's first custom processor\nWhile Apple has already spent well over a decade making powerful chipsets for the iPhone and iPad, the company isn't using those in the new Macs. Instead, there is a specific system-on-a-chip architecture used for Macs and MacBooks called the M1. The first Macs to use Apple Silicon are the late 2020 models of the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini.\nIn early 2021, Apple introduced the 24-inch iMac and iPad Pro with the M1 processor.\nThe M1 uses a 5nm architecture with 16 billion transistors, four high-performance cores, four high-efficiency cores, and eight GPU cores. Even in the MacBook Air, which lacks external cooling and has one of the GPU cores disabled, the machine still runs faster than 98% of consumer notebooks on the market.\nApple boasted the M1 as the world's fastest CPU in low-power silicon, the world's best CPU performance per watt, the world's fastest graphics in a personal computer, and breakthrough machine learning (ML) thanks to the Neural Engine. This adds up to the M1 having a 3.5x faster CPU, 6x faster GPU, and 15x faster ML than previous Macs using Intel.\nThe GPU is capable of running nearly 25,000 threads simultaneously with 2.6 teraflops of throughput. Apple says this makes it the fastest integrated GPU in a consumer PC.\nThe webcam used on the new MacBooks remains 720p, but the M1's ML and ISP upgrades improve the overall image.\nM1 Pro and M1 Max\nApple introduced the M1 Pro and M1 Max during its \"Unleashed\" event in October 2021. They are the pro-tier chipsets used in the 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nThese processors offer up to 3.7x CPU performance, 13x GPU performance, and 11x machine learning performance when compared to equivalent Intel models. The efficiency gained by the M1 Pro and M1 Max also enables battery life gains with up to 21 hours of use in some configurations.\nThe M1 Pro has up to a 10-core CPU, up to a 16-core GPU, and can be configured with 32GB of RAM. The M1 Max has up to a 10-core CPU, up to a 32-core GPU, and can be configured with 64GB of RAM.\nM1 Ultra\nThe M1 Ultra has a 20-core CPU and can be configured with up to a 64-core GPU and 128GB of RAM. It is the first desktop-only Apple Silicon processor, and it was built by essentially combining two M1 Max processors with an UltraFusion connector.\nThe 20-core processor can outperform a 28-core Xenon-powered Mac Pro by 60% during normal operations. Even with all of this performance, the M1 Ultra consumes 1000KWh less power per year than competing high-end PCs.\nThe Mac Studio with M1 Ultra lacks the I/O of the Mac Pro tower it replaced.\nA-series processors\nDuring the 2020 WWDC, Apple boasted about successfully bringing 10 billion chips to devices through the years and wanting to bring that expertise to Mac. The company believed that it could hit the sweet spot between power consumption and performance by offering chips that are very powerful while remaining very efficient.\nOver a decade of custom chip building through 2020, Apple has been able to increase CPU performance by 100x and GPU performance by 1000x.\nApple also designed new system architectures and technologies to specifically take advantage of its design, like the Neural Engine for machine learning or the Secure Enclave for encryption. Combine those technologies with the existing software implementations like Metal and Swift, and Apple can utilize its custom chipsets far better than with Intel.\nApple Silicon Benchmarked\nApple A-series chips have powered iPhone and iPad since the iPhone 4, and the most recent generations have proven to be as powerful as consumer laptops running Intel. While these are designed to be mobile-first with battery life as the primary concern, they still pack a punch.\nBenchmarks across different system architectures are not representative of performance for each, but give a good snapshot of how performative a mobile device on ARM can be when compared to the aging Intel chips.\nM2\nThe M2 processor is an improvement over the M1 in every metric. Of course, it doesn't outperform the higher-end M1 Pro or beyond because it isn't meant to \u2014 this is the entry chip.\nThe single core score of 1869 for the M2 is a slight bump over the M1's 1707. Graphics, however, show a significant jump from 7395 to 8900. These scores are in line with Apple's performance claims.\nThese devices run the M2:\n- 13-inch MacBook Pro\n- M2 MacBook Air\nM1\nAppleInsider's benchmarks showed that the M1 is faster than nearly every Intel Mac chip. In single-core performance, the MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon outshined all of the Macs on test, with a 54% better Geekbench score than its nearest rival, the Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro. This makes it faster than the Intel Core i9 and the Mac Pro's Xeon, a chip family considered a processing workhorse.\nt's a somewhat similar story when you turn to the multi-core test, as the 7,395 achieved by the M1 is very impressive and beats the vast majority of the field. While it narrowly beats the 7,067 scored by the Core i9 in the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac Pro's Xeon-W beat it with a 8,632 score.\nFor multi-core tasks, the M1 outpaced many Macs available today, and can keep pace with the high-performance processors used in the more premium end of the market. Only the Mac Pro's Xeon beat it in the multi-core benchmark.\nThese devices run the M1:\n- 13-inch MacBook Pro\n- MacBook Air\n- Mac mini\n- 24-inch iMac\n- fifth-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro\n- third-generation 11-inch iPad Pro\n- iPad Air 5\nThese devices run the M1 Pro and M1 Max:\n- 16-inch MacBook Pro\n- 14-inch MacBook Pro\nThe Mac Studio runs the M1 Max and is the only Mac with the M1 Ultra processor.\nA15 Bionic\nThe A15 has a 6-core CPU with two performance cores and four efficiency cores. The GPU has 4 cores or 5 cores depending on what device it is used in.\nThe Neural Engine is faster, with 15.8 trillion operations per second. The chip includes a new image signal processor for improved photos and new features.\nThe A15 average single-core score is 1730, a roughly 10% increase from the A14 score of 1575. Multi-core scores average out to 4621, or nearly 21% higher than the previous model.\nThese devices run the A15 Bionic:\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPad mini 6\n- Third-generation iPhone SE\nA14 Bionic\nThe A14 packs in 11.8 billion transistors onto the chip, up from the 8.5 billion of the A13, with the changes enabling Apple to be more precise in how it uses the chip to shape the user's experience. The higher transistor count translates directly into compute power that can be used in games or apps.\nThe Neural Engine is 16 cores versus 8 cores in the previous generation. This enables things like better computational photography or improved learning algorithms in applications.\nThe A14 boasts a 6-core CPU and 4-core GPU in a 5-nanometer process. Benchmarks for the A14 Bionic in the iPhone 12 Pro score about 20% faster than the A13 in the iPhone 11 Pro.\nThese devices run the A14 Bionic:\nA13 Bionic\nThe 2.66GHz, 6-core processor scores 1325 single-core and 3382 multi-core in Geekbench 5. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with an 8th-generation Intel Core i5 processor scores similar.\nThese devices run the A13 Bionic:\n- Second-generation iPhone SE\n- iPhone 11\n- iPhone 11 Pro\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max\n- 9th-generation 10.2-inch iPad\nA12X Bionic and A12Z Bionic\nThe iPad-specific processors in the A12 series are unique in the fact that they are the same chipset. The A12Z is a re-binned A12X with the extra GPU core active. Because of this they score very similarly.\nThe single-core score is 1115 and multi-core is 4626 in Geekbench 5. The mid-range 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 processor scores similar.\nWhen placed within the Apple Developer Transition Kit, it scores single-core 1005 and multi-core 4555.\nThese devices run the A12Z Bionic:\n- 2nd-generation 11-inch iPad Pro\n- 4th-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro\n- Apple Developer Transition Kit\nA12 Bionic\nThe 2.5GHz processor scores 1106 single-core and 2687 multi-core in Geekbench 5. An iMac 4K with the Intel Core i5 scores similar.\nThese devices run the A12 Bionic:\n- iPhone XR\n- iPhone XS\n- iPhone XS Max\n- iPad Air 3\n- 5th-generation iPad mini\nA11 Bionic\nThe first Apple Silicon with a dedicated Neural Engine, thus dubbed \"Bionic,\" scored 917 single-core and 2350 multi-core on Geekbench 5. The 2020 MacBook Air with the Intel Core i3 scores similar.\nThese devices run the A11 Bionic:\n- iPhone 8\n- iPhone 8 Plus\n- iPhone X\nThe specs and year-over-year gains in Apple's mobile chipsets may hint at the degree to which the M1 and future Apple Silicon for Mac will improve.\nThe Apple Silicon Transition\nAfter the initial Apple Silicon announcement, Apple provided a Developer Transition Kit that developers could order using the \"Universal App Quick Start Program.\" The DTK is a Mac mini running on an A12Z with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Developers had to pay $500 to rent the machine, which they later had to return.\nWith this kit, devs can get started making apps run natively on macOS and Apple Silicon. However, hardware is not all that Apple included to help with the process.\nDuring WWDC 2020, developers could attend virtual sessions or discuss issues with engineers within the forums and the Apple Developer app. Apple also provided day-one documentation on developing and testing Universal apps.\nAny app built for iOS or iPadOS runs natively on the Apple Silicon Mac as well.\nOn macOS Big Sur, there are multiple applications built just for the transition. Apple called out three specific ones: Universal 2, Rosetta 2, and Virtualization.\nApple technically completed the transition away from Intel with its Mac Studio release in 2022. The company hinted at a Mac Pro running an M-series processor, but it didn't arrive in 2022.\nThe tower Mac Pro with Intel is still for sale, and the future of the product isn't yet known. Apple could still introduce an M2-variant of the product in 2023.\nUniversal 2\nUniversal 2 is a universal binary that works on Intel and Apple Silicon-based Macs. With the same binary developers can make apps that work on both platforms.\nThird-party developers like Microsoft and Adobe have already begun building apps to work on the new chipset. The WWDC demo showed the new apps running easily even while editing 4K video live.\nRosetta 2\nAs Rosetta allowed PowerPC apps to run on Intel Macs, Rosetta 2 is fulfilling the same role to allow Intel apps to run on the new architecture.\nInstead of a \"just in time\" (JIT) process that the original Rosetta used, Rosetta 2 does the heavy lifting on installation with the translation of the code, front-loading the processing load. Code in third-party browsers executing Java and similar other technologies are still using JIT technologies for execution.\nAs demonstrated at WWDC, Rosetta 2 is powerful enough to run some games built for Intel without significant issues.\nVirtualization\nVirtualization software also runs on Apple Silicon Macs, but the extent of what and how is not fully known yet. Apple has demonstrated Linux use through virtualization apps like Parallels desktop, and Parallels offers an M1-friendly variant of its software that can run ARM-based Windows.\nM1 Macs don't support BootCamp for running Windows. Apple's Craig Federighi has said that it's up to you Microsoft whether to support M1 Macs with its desktop OS.\nApple mentioned that other platforms like Docker will also work on Apple Silicon and that devs will be able to take full advantage of the software."

      "text": "Years after Apple shifted to Apple Silicon, and after an on-again, off-again effort by Valve, the company has finally issued a beta version of the Steam client.\nThere have been Apple Silicon games on Steam for a long time. But, only now, five years after Apple's technology debut, is Steam finally hitting the endgame on a native client.\nThe latest beta, published late Thursday, has made the Steam Client and Steam Helper Universal apps.\nThe option to participate in the beta isn't hidden, and doesn't require a special set of permissions. In the Settings menu, there's an Interface option. All the user has to do is opt into beta updates, and restart the client to get the new download.\nIn our brief testing this morning on a M1 Ultra Mac Studio the client performs as you'd expect it to. There don't appear to be any user interface changes, nor anything of any note beyond the client being a Universal app.\nThe writing is on the wall for Intel Macs. Apple announced very early during the 2025 WWDC that macOS Tahoe will be the last version to fully support Intel Macs. There will be security updates for some time to come, though.\nWorse for gamers is what Apple said about Rosetta 2 support. In the same State of the Platform presentation, Apple said that Rosetta 2 would end in the fall of 2027, with scaled back support for unmigrated games.\nWhat scaled back means, exactly, isn't clear. All Apple has said so far is that \"we will keep a subset of Rosetta functionality aimed at supporting older unmaintained gaming titles, that rely on Intel-based frameworks.\"\nApple isn't likely to say anything more about it until the 2026 WWDC."

      "text": "macOS\nAll about macOS\nTable of Contents\nThe Mac operating system has gone through nearly 40 years of updates to arrive at where it is today. Since macOS 11 was announced in 2020, Mac software has begun pushing towards more iOS-like paradigms and UI.\nWith the advent of custom Apple Silicon in Macs, macOS and the hardware it runs on are more tightly integrated than ever. Apple's software and services are tied to the operating system, including the Mac App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more. There is also a significant focus on privacy and security throughout.\nSince Unix is at the operating system's core, power users will appreciate server tools and the Terminal. However, the surface of macOS is user-friendly and built with accessibility in mind.\nmacOS Name Changes\nmacOS started as \"Mac OS,\" which launched in 1984. It underwent multiple major releases until Mac OS 9 was shipped to customers in 1999.\nApple changed its naming policy with the launch of Mac OS X, known colloquially as OS X, in March 2001. After that release, Apple kept the significant version number at 10 for nearly two decades. Instead of changing the major version number, Apple used the following minor number to indicate annual upgrade releases, including version 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3.\nIn 2016 Apple shifted all of its operating systems into similar naming conventions. The \"X\" was removed, and Mac OS became macOS to match iOS, tvOS, and watchOS.\nThe version naming remained the same for four more years but ultimately shifted to a full numerical jump with each release starting in 2020.\nmacOS Releases\nBelow is a brief summary of each macOS release going back to 2013. Apple announces the next operating system during WWDC in the spring and releases it to the public in the fall.\nmacOS 16\nApple will reveal macOS 16 during WWDC 2025 on June 9. It may include feature changes, but rumors also indicate a redesign is possible that will make some elements resemble visionOS.\nmacOS 15 Sequoia\nThe 2024 update is called macOS Sequoia and it includes very little outside of wider ecosystem updates. Users can now take advantage of iPhone display mirroring and a built-in window tiling feature.\nThe Passwords app introduced in iOS 18 is also available in macOS Sequoia. The Messages app has new sticker options, tapbacks with emoji, and the Settings app has been rearranged.\nThe more significant portion of the release is dedicated to Apple Intelligence. Users will gain access to the Image Playground generation tool, Writing Tools for editing text, and an improved Siri.\nmacOS 14 Sonoma\nIn 2023 Apple revealed macOS Sonoma, a smaller update feature-wise but packed with quality-of-life features and UI tweaks. Most of what is new comes from ecosystem-wide updates also included in iOS 17.\nThe macOS segment during WWDC started with a screensaver update, which was an early indication of the minimal OS release. Users can set video screensavers similar to what is found in tvOS and have them open into still wallpapers.\nWidgets have been getting a big focus from Apple, which are now able to be added to the Mac desktop. Users don't need to install apps for some widgets since their nearby iPhone will provide the necessary data.\nOther updates include features for video conferencing and a Game Mode. Users can cause full-screen reactions with a hand gesture during a video call, something Apple allows developers to disable by default.\nOwners of the Apple Vision Pro can view their Mac display within visionOS via a continuity screen sharing mode. It allows the power of the user's Mac to be fully accessible while still interacting in a spatial computing environment.\nmacOS 13 Ventura\nThe 2022 update is called macOS Ventura, and it adds a new windowing system called Stage Manager and changes System Preferences to System Settings. Apple pushed updated collaboration and social features alongside more app and UI tweaks.\nApple introduced the Clock and Weather app to Mac for the first time, and redesigned the System Preferences app to look just like iPadOS Settings. The redesign led to a strange rename, with Apple calling it System Settings.\nSince quality webcams have become a necessity in the new reality of remote work and collaboration, Apple introduced a feature called Continuity Camera. Now, the iPhone camera can act as the Mac's webcam and microphone without any configuration necessary.\nStage Manager was introduced as a new way to manipulate windows and manage workspaces on macOS, but it is primarily an iPadOS 16 feature. However, Macs have more control over window sizes and positioning thanks to how Mac apps work.\nOther updates include improved collaboration features across iWork apps and Safari. Also, SharePlay is now a feature in iMessage too.\nmacOS 12 Monterey\nApple announced macOS Monterey during its 2021 WWDC, and new features focused on social communication and privacy. It was released to the public in November 2021.\nSharePlay and Universal Control were the headlining features. Apple introduced SharePlay as an apparent reaction to the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Universal Control was meant to bring additional synergy to using multiple Apple devices, but it wasn't shipped with the original release.\nSharePlay integrates with FaceTime to enable up to 32 people to view the same media simultaneously. Any app taking advantage of the feature can display time-synced content to everyone on the call and give each caller specific playback controls. Apple Music, Apple TV, TikTok, and Disney+ are just a few apps that utilize SharePlay.\nUniversal Control was an ambitious feature with a relatively short demo during the WWDC keynote. It showed a user could have multiple Macs and iPads connected so that one mouse and keyboard could travel wirelessly between the displays. In addition, features like drag and drop worked across this connection, making multiple computers running their operating system seem to mesh into one.\nApple shipped Universal Control to customers in March 2022 with macOS 12.3. The shipping version has refined controls for adding iPads and Macs to the system and controlling their position in the display settings.\nOther refinements include Quick Note, AirPlay to Mac, and an improved Safari experience with new extensions. The system UI also saw more slight tweaks to bring it closer to iOS.\nmacOS 11 Big Sur\nApple announced macOS Big Sur at WWDC 2020 and released the new OS in November 2020. The operating system was redesigned with textured icons, colorful sidebars, and more transparent and curvy elements. The design changes make the Mac look much like iPadOS than ever before.\nBig Sur also begins to move the Mac away from Intel chips to custom Apple Silicon, including the new M1 chip.\nApple offers several tools to help developers make the transition. All iOS and iPadOS apps can run on Apple Silicon natively, though developers can opt-out of providing them in the Mac App Store. Developers can also easily upgrade their mobile apps to be more Mac-like with Mac Catalyst.\nThe first Apple Silicon-running Macs, including updated models of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini, use Rosetta 2 for non-optimized apps. This virtualization software runs Intel apps on M1 Macs at speeds similar to how they'd run on Intel Macs. Rosetta 2 helps both users and developers transition away from Intel.\nApple updated Safari in the new version with more privacy and security protections. Apple has made third-party extensions work with Safari even if they were built for Chrome. Translating web pages is now a built-in function and works entirely on-device.\nMessages is now a Mac Catalyst app with feature parity with its iOS counterpart. Users can send message effects and Tapbacks, and tag users in a group chat just like in iOS 14 for iPhone.\nmacOS 10.15 Catalina\nReleased on October 7, 2019, macOS 10.15 Catalina introduced significant improvements to app handling.\nA major change in Catalina was Apple's decision to end support for 32-bit apps, requiring developers to rework their apps into 64-bit versions to continue functioning properly. Not all developers elected to migrate their apps, forcing some users to choose between abandoning vintage apps or upgrading to Catalina.\nAnother chief change is the removal of iTunes, in favor of new apps that replace the majority of its functions. New apps for Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV spread iTunes' core functions across apps that correspond to iOS counterparts. Another iTunes feature, iOS device backup duties, is now found in the Finder.\n10.15.1 introduced new emoji, support for the AirPods Pro, AMD Navi RDNA graphics cards in eGPU enclosures, alteration to the Photos app, and an option to opt in to Siri reviews.\n10.15.2 made refinements to the Apple News, Stocks, Photos, Mail, and other apps, as well as fixes for issues in the Photos and Mail apps.\n10.15.3 improved multi-stream video editing performance for HEVC and H.264-encoded video on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, along with Pro Display XDR optimizations.\n10.15.4 added improved support for HDR-compatible monitors and added reference modes for the Pro Display XDR.\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave\nOut on September 24, 2018, macOS 10.14 Mojave's main new feature was dark mode, an alternate user interface. Users can switch between dark and light modes, and the theme can also change on a schedule via Dynamic Desktop.\nApple ported several iOS apps to macOS, including a News app, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home for managing HomeKit. The initiative was part of \"Project Marzipan,\" to enable iOS-developed apps to function in macOS with few changes. This initial quartet of apps demonstrated the concept to users and developers.\nOn the desktop, Stacks are an organization method for files in the workspace. Stacks piles up similar files into grouped collections automatically. Continuity Camera allows for photographs taken on an iPhone to be transferred instantly into a macOS application.\nDay and night mode change your app appearance\n10.14.1 consisted of new emoji, security enhancements and bug fixes, along with Group FaceTime.\n10.14.2 provided security and bug fixes, a description matched by macOS 10.14.3.\n10.14.4 added integration with the just-launched Apple News+ subscription service, in the Apple News app. Support for second-generation AirPods, Safari Autofill for MacBooks with Touch ID hardware, air quality index readings in Maps, and real-time text for phone calls made through a nearby iPhone were among the other changes.\n10.14.5 was largely a maintenance update, though included fixes relating to AirPlay 2 support. 10.14.6 continued the security and bug fix theme.\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra\nReleased on September 9, 2017, macOS 10.13 High Sierra included a major change for storage, with macOS switching over to the Apple File System, APFS. Intended to take advantage of the use of Flash and SSD storage, Apple built AFPS with encryption and enhanced security in mind. The company designed it to work with all Apple platforms, including watchOS, iOS, tvOS, and macOS.\nThe addition of Metal 2 included driver optimizations that brought up to 10 times better draw call throughput for graphics work, more debugging tools, and a migrated Mac Window Server.\nOther notable items include the migration of H.264 to H.265/HEVC to better work with 4K and HDR content. It added a faster and more power-efficient Safari. Apple's browser also added increased privacy protection, including Intelligent Tracking Prevention.\nHigh Sierra was the last version to support 32-bit apps \"without compromises,\" with Apple continuing its push to get developers over to making 64-bit apps.\n10.13.1 added 70 new emoji, a fix to a Bluetooth bug involving Apple Pay, reliability improvements to Microsoft Exchange message encryption, a Spotlight input fix, and the patching of assorted KRACK wi-fi vulnerabilities.\n10.13.2 was largely a maintenance release, improving compatibility for some USB audio devices, VoiceOver navigation while viewing PDFs, and a fix for a Root account generation flaw.\n10.13.3 included relatively small updates, including an issue where Messages conversations were temporarily stored out of order.\n10.13.4 incorporated a warning to users if they are running 32-bit apps and the launch of official eGPU support.\n10.13.5 added support for Messages in iCloud, allowing conversations to be synchronized between multiple Apple devices.\n10.13.6 delivered support for AirPlay 2, along with a variety of stability and security improvements.\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra\nAvailable to end users on September 20, 2016, macOS 10.12 Sierra heralded the introduction of Siri on Mac, bringing Apple's digital assistant to the desktop. Sierra also added a cross-platform clipboard synchronization with iOS and iCloud file synchronization between iOS and macOS.\nThe update added Picture-in-Picture feature, familiar to iOS users. It also included rich Messages that moved closer to iOS messaging, changes to Photos, Apple Pay for the web, and auto-unlock via Apple Watch.\n10.12.1 added iPhone 7 Photos compatibility fixes, Safari security enhancements, and fixes to Microsoft Office and Exchange issues, among other changes.\n10.12.2 improved the setup and reliability of Auto Unlock, Touch Bar screenshot support, and a wide variety of fixes and improvements.\n10.12.3 improved automatic graphics switching on the 2016 MacBook Pro 15-inch, a fix for PDF corruption, and MacBook Pro battery drain issues in Safari.\n10.12.4 added Night Shift, new PDFKit APIs, cricket scores to Siri, and more options for iCloud Analytics.\n10.12.5 solved stuttering audio issues for USB headphones, a \"media-free\" installation of the Windows 10 Creators Update using Boot Camp, and enhancements to the Mac App Store for compatibility with \"future software updates.\"\n10.12.6 largely consisted of a maintenance update.\nmacOS 10.11 El Capitan\nApple's 2015 update focused less on marquee features and more on performance enhancements and subtle refinements. Apple released macOS 10.11 El Capitan on September 30, 2015.\nThe update added macOS support for Apple's Metal API. Metal is a low-level API that helps developers optimize their apps' 3D graphics. Today, it's still used across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS.\nIt also introduced Apple's San Francisco system font, which it still uses today across its platforms. Apple gave Mission Control, the window and desktop quick-view app, a makeover with a cleaner design.\nEl Capitan brought new window-management options, including a green button that can move an app either into full-screen or Split View, a side-by-side multitasking feature also available on iPad.\nThe update enhanced Spotlight search, added Safari pinned sites and a mute button, and a modernized Notes app.\nmacOS 10.10 Yosemite\nApple gave its desktop software a new look with its 2014 update, OS X Yosemite. Version 10.10 redesigned various elements, including updated toolbars and translucent window elements.\nYosemite added the Today view in Notification center, which showed a customizable series of widgets. The Today view lived in a separate panel from notifications. Apple eventually killed the Today view in Big Sur, which integrated widgets into the same panel as grouped notifications.\nThe 2014 update also saw the launch of iCloud Drive, the file storage system built into Finder that serves as a rival to Dropbox and Google Drive. iCloud Drive didn't become ubiquitous across Apple's platforms until 2017, when the Files app launched on iOS and iPadOS.\nHandoff launched during this software generation, on Yosemite and iOS 7. The feature allows you to pick up immediately where you left off when changing devices. Handoff adds user convenience and ecosystem stickiness, as the perk can encourage users to go all-in on Apple hardware.\nSafari in Yosemite added the Favorites view and Tab view, and search-engine support for DuckDuckGo. Mail first supported Markup for filling out forms and annotating PDFs in Yosemite, and Messages gained a new look.\nmacOS 10.9 Mavericks\nApple released OS X Mavericks on October 22, 2013. The updated added iCloud Keychain, Apple Maps, and iBooks, which is now called Apple Books.\nMavericks also updated Safari, enhanced multi-display support, and added tabs and tags to Finder.\nThe update also included performance-enhancing and battery-boosting updates under the hood.\nApple continues to update macOS each year with new features that bring tighter ecosystem integration across Mac, iPhone, iPad, and its other devices."
