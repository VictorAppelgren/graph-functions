  "content": "Abdul Carter hasn\u2019t been in the NFL long enough to know that the preseason is designed for keeping secrets.\n\nWill the rookie who has dominated Giants training camp keep a lid on his best pass-rush moves during his debut Saturday against the Bills so that they stay fresh for when the scores matter?\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m putting it all on film,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI\u2019m going out there, I\u2019m playing, I\u2019m doing what I do best.\u201d\n\nThere is a level of confidence in all of Carter\u2019s answers that he earned by leading the nation with 22.5 tackles for loss at Penn State last season, becoming the No. 3 pick in the draft and causing fits for the Giants\u2019 offensive line from multiple spots across the defensive line in practice.\n\nIs he disappointed that he won\u2019t get to make his mark out of the gate by pressuring quarterback Josh Allen? The reigning NFL MVP is sitting out the game as Mitch Trubisky starts for the Bills.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s playing for me,\u201d Carter said. \u201cDefinitely a good opportunity for me to get my routine down coming into a football game. I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nHas transitioning to the NFL been more difficult than expected?\n\n\u201cNo, nothing too complicated,\u201d Carter said. \u201cObviously, college has detail, but I feel like at the NFL just a higher level of detail I have to be focused on. That\u2019s the biggest difference.\u201d\n\nCarter has fit in seamlessly alongside pass-rushers Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux because of his versatility to line up at off-ball linebacker and three-technique defensive tackle as well as on the edge.\n\n\u201cThe talent shows up out there on the field,\u201d defensive coordinator Shane Bowen said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a very instinctive player \u2013 finds ways to get to the football.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a natural feel to dip, to lean, to bend. It\u2019s just a matter of making sure, as a coaching staff, we do a good job not overloading him.\u201d\n\nCarter\u2019s spin move went viral online \u2013 and among teammates \u2013 during camp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy watching Abdul go pull out some crazy spin move,\u201d linebacker Darius Muasau said, \u201cor something that you never expected.\u201d\n\nBut there is more in Carter\u2019s bag of tricks to be shown now that plays aren\u2019t whistled dead before the quarterback is touched, the way that they are in practice.\n\n\u201cOn the edge, you have more space to work with. Inside it is more constricted, but you just have to find different ways to win,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have quickness on the inside \u2013 just misdirection. I have power too, so I like to mix it up.\u201d\n\nCarter is one of just a handful of impact players expected to get in the game for the Giants despite head coach Brian Daboll\u2019s refusal to reveal his playing-time plans for the starters. His teammates are expecting big things.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to do too much talking about Abdul because he\u2019ll show you,\u201d Burns said. \u201cI ain\u2019t got to talk about him.\u201d",

      "text": "So far, Abdul Carter has been exactly as advertised. The hype around him grows by the day.\nHe made Giants offensive linemen look silly during spirited one-on-one drills Friday.\nCarter used a spin move to blow right past Jon Runyan Jr. during one-on-ones, leaving the veteran Runyan grasping at air. Carter did a bit of a celebration after the play.\nHe used a swim move to breeze by Joshua Ezeudu, who committed a would-be holding penalty after he was beaten.\nHe used his speed to make it seem as if John Michael Schmitz weren\u2019t even there as he sidestepped right around him. The pass-rush wins came from both a three-point stance and upright stance, showing off his versatility to play in different spots.\nIn 11-on-11s, he constantly blew up plays. Carter torched overmatched tight end Greg Dulcich for a would-be sack before Jameis Winston threw the ball away.\nThe variety of different moves Carter has in his repertoire is what stands out most to the offensive linemen trying to block him.\n\u201cNot a lot of people can move the way he does,\u201d rookie guard Marcus Mbow said Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s a very fast, very explosive cat.\n\u201cJust the ability to counter. I feel like it\u2019s just effortless, being able to go from one move to the next, just continuously working. I think that\u2019s probably the most impressive thing about it.\u201d\nRookie Cam Skattebo exited practice early with trainers and did not return. He looked frustrated as he walked off the field.\nHe had just returned to team drills for the first time in two practices. Before practice, coach Brian Daboll said they\u2019re \u201cmanaging\u201d him but did not reveal what the injury is.\nMalik Nabers has looked uncoverable throughout camp.\nHe made a tough touchdown grab over newcomer Paulson Adebo on a fade route in the right corner of the end zone during 11-on-11s. Russell Wilson perfectly placed his pass where only Nabers could catch it.\nNabers busted out a touchdown dance after the play.\nWith much milder temperatures than in previous days, Daboll ran Friday\u2019s practice particularly long \u2014 more than the usual two hours."

      "text": "Daniel Jones\u2019 Colts debut did not look much different from his Giants career.\nJones entered Thursday\u2019s 24-16 preseason loss to the Ravens earlier than expected when Anthony Richardson went down with a dislocated pinky on his throwing hand in the first quarter.\nThe Duke product finished his night with 10 completions on 21 attempts for 144 yards. He committed no turnovers but did not lead any touchdown drives.\n\u201cGot to be ready to go. That\u2019s part of the game,\u201d Jones said of replacing the injured Richardson. \u201cSome good, some bad. Caught a rhythm there I think at points, and we were moving the ball well, executing, but a couple things here and there kept us from getting in the end zone.\u201d\nBefore leaving with the injury, Richardson completed 2 of 3 attempts for 21 yards.\nThe two are in a battle for the starting quarterback position, but Jones didn\u2019t necessarily get a leg up with his up-and-down play after Richardson went down.\nJones took over on third down during the Colts\u2019 second drive, approximately eight minutes into the game, and handled all the quarterback reps until halftime as Notre Dame rookie Riley Leonard played the second half.\nIn Jones\u2019 first full drive, he passed for one first down before Indianapolis was forced to punt on the next set of downs. Jones was sacked for a loss of nine yards on third down.\nHis next time out, Jones led the Colts to a field goal, utilizing two big pass plays of over 20 yards.\nJones followed up the scoring drive with another one-first-down series that ended in a punt and two more drives that wound up in field-goal range, with Colts kicker Spencer Shrader converting one of the kicks.\nLeonard handled the entire second half, but was unimpressive as he tallied 92 yards on 12-for-24 passing with an interception. He added 34 rushing yards, highlighted by a 21-yard scamper, and helped lead the team to its lone touchdown drives.\nAfter the game, Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said Richardson\u2019s pinky \u201cpopped out, popped back in.\u201d\nJones joined the Colts in the offseason on a one-year, $14 million contract for the opportunity to duel with the former fourth-overall pick in Richardson, who has battled injury and inconsistent play through his first two seasons.\n\u2014 with AP"
