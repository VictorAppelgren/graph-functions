  "title": "Apple Notches Best Week In Years, Trump Shakes Fed Leadership: This Week In Markets - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)",
  "description": "After a dip last week, Wall Street rebounded as earnings remained strong. Tech stocks surged, but Eli Lilly struggled. Trump imposed tariffs on India and nominated Stephen Miran for Fed seat.",
  "content": "After last week's declines, triggered by a weaker-than-expected jobs report and a June inflation uptick, Wall Street rebounded with strong gains as earnings momentum remained robust.\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc. PLTR delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, sparking a 20% weekly rally \u2013 the best performance in the S&P 500 \u2013 that pushed its market capitalization above $500 billion.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing investments, on top of the $500 billion pledged earlier this year. The move secured an exemption from Trump's tariffs and is expected to boost iPhone sales. Apple shares surged over 12% for the week, marking their strongest performance since 2020.\n\nWhile tech stocks soared, pharmaceuticals struggled. Despite strong quarterly earnings, Eli Lilly & Co. LLY plunged 14% on Thursday \u2014 its worst single-day drop since August 2000 \u2014 after trial data for its weight-loss pill orforglipron fell short of expectations.\n\nOn the tariff front, President Donald Trump doubled duties on Indian imports to 50%, targeting New Delhi's purchase and resale of Russian crude.\n\nHe also confirmed a 39% tariff on Swiss imports and imposed new duties on one-kilogram gold bars, a move that could pressure Swiss gold refineries and disrupt the gold futures market.\n\nTrump nominated Stephen Miran, current chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill the Federal Reserve Board seat vacated by Adriana Kugler. Miran, whose term runs until January 2026, has argued that tariffs won't fuel inflation, a stance aligned with Trump's push for lower interest rates.\n\nMarkets see him as a likely ally to the president in future monetary policy decisions.\n\nTrump's economic team is also reportedly considering current Fed Governor Christopher Waller as Jerome Powell's successor when Powell's term ends next year.\n\nWaller notably dissented in July's Fed meeting, voting for a rate cut while Powell and most policymakers favored holding rates steady.\n\u2022 The Dollar Faces A \u2018Wile E.

Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nWhat To Know: Palantir shares are riding momentum to all-time highs after the company beat analyst estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter. Palantir reported second-quarter revenue of $1.004 billion versus estimates of $939.71 million, and adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share versus estimates of 14 cents per share.\nU.S. Commercial revenue increased 93% year-over-year and U.S. Government revenue was up 53% year-over-year. The company\u2019s customer count grew 43% year-over-year in the second quarter.\nPalantir guided for third-quarter revenue of $1.083 billion to $1.087 billion versus estimates of $981.1 million, representing the highest sequential quarterly revenue growth guidance in company history. The company also raised its full-year outlook to a range of $4.14 billion to $4.15 billion versus estimates of $3.9 billion, as it continues to ride strong AI tailwinds.\n\"This is still only the beginning of something much larger and, we believe, even more significant,\" said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives maintained Palantir with an Outperform rating following the print and raised the price target from $160 to a Street-high $200, citing \"continued hyper growth demand\" for the company\u2019s AI products.\nSeveral other analysts also maintained bullish or neutral ratings and raised price targets ranging from $141 to $182. RBC Capital took a more bearish view, maintaining an Underperform rating and lifting its price target from $40 to $45.\nIncreased trading volume and positive sector trends appear to be contributing to the upward movement in Palantir shares. The stock shows strong momentum with a Benzinga momentum score of 99 after hitting a high of $180.58 on Wednesday. Support is solid at $171.01, which aligns with the recent low and provides a clear floor for potential pullbacks.\nThe RSI is calculated at 66.75, indicating that the stock is approaching overbought territory but still has room to run.

      "text": "- Apple adds $100B to U.S. manufacturing, bringing total commitment to $600B through its new American Manufacturing Program.\n- AAPL stock surged 8% in two days, its strongest back-to-back rally since April.\n- Get ahead of next week\u2019s CPI & PPI with Chris Capre\u2019s live trading strategy session this Sunday. Register Now \u2192\nApple Inc.\u2018s AAPL smart decision to add another $100 billion to its U.S. manufacturing commitment is being hailed on Wall Street as a tactical move to dodge steep tariffs under President Donald Trump\u2018s trade regime\u2014and possibly reignite its stock, which is still down 12% year-to-date.\n- AAPL stock is moving fast. Check live prices here.\nThe company announced the launch of its American Manufacturing Program (AMP) on Aug. 6, bringing its total planned U.S. investment to $600 billion over four years, up from $500 billion previously.\nThe timing was crucial: on the same day, Trump unveiled a 100% tariff on semiconductors for companies not building in the U.S. Apple, thanks to its new commitment, was officially granted an exemption.\nFor analysts, the message was clear\u2014this wasn't just a patriotic investment push, it was a calculated maneuver to shield the iPhone business from tariff headwinds that could hurt pricing, margins, and competitiveness.\nInside Apple's $600 Billion US Expansion Plan\nApple's American Manufacturing Program (AMP) will work to recenter its supply chain inside the U.S., in partnership with 10 domestic companies. This includes:\n- Expansion of Corning's Kentucky plant to produce U.S.-made cover glass for every iPhone and Apple Watch\n- Building out an end-to-end silicon supply chain, with 19 billion chips expected to be produced in the U.S. in 2025\n- Continuing construction of a server factory in Houston, supporting Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute\n- Growing data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, and Oregon\n- Progress on a second campus in Austin, Texas\nCapex is also accelerating: Apple has spent $9.5 billion year-to-date, up from $6.5 billion in the same period last year. R&D grew 11% year over year in the third fiscal quarter and is expected to rise again next quarter, much of it tied to AI investments.\nApple Could Gain Market Share: Bank of America\n\"It seems increasingly likely that several Apple products will be exempt from tariffs,\" Bank of America\u2019s analyst Wamsi Mohan said in a note Thursday.\nHe noted the competitive edge Apple could gain if its products avoid tariffs while others do not.\n\"We believe there is the potential for Apple gaining smartphone market share in the U.S. if competitors are exposed to tariffs while iPhones were to remain exempt.\"\nMohan had previously modeled a 200bps gross margin headwind under a 20% tariff scenario. With the exemption in hand, he now sees 100\u2013200bps of potential margin upside, which could help push Apple toward 50% gross margins over time.\nHe also flagged currency effects as a possible tailwind in the upcoming December quarter and raised his price objective from $240 to $250, citing increased confidence in Apple's over $8 earnings-per-share potential in calendar 2026.\nA Masterclass In Managing Uncertainty: JPMorgan\nJPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee described Apple's announcement as a strategic response to long-standing tariff risks.\n\"Apple and Tim Cook delivered a masterclass in managing uncertainty after months and months of overhang relative to the potential challenges the company could face from tariffs.\"\nHe indicated that the revised and higher U.S. commitment should position Apple favorably as the 100% semiconductor tariffs go into effect.\nApple's expanded domestic footprint helps mitigate those risks and reduces the chance of future policy exposure.\nApple Named As Exempt Company: Goldman Sachs\nAccording to Goldman Sachs\u2019 analyst Michael Ng, Apple's tariff exemption is a game-changer for unit economics and relative competitiveness.\n\u201cApple\u2019s tariff exemption should alleviate tariff headwind concerns\u2026 the exemption could also put it at a potential cost advantage relative to smartphone, PC, and tablet competitors that do not receive an exemption\u201d\nGoldman Sachs holds a 12-month price target at $266, implying a 22% surge from current levels.\nMarket Reactions\nShares of Apple rose more than 3% on Thursday, extending Wednesday's 5.1% surge and marking the stock's strongest two-day rally since April.\nRead Next:\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "- Trump to nominate Stephen Miran to replace Adriana Kugler at Fed Board.\n- Dollar slips, gold rallies as markets price September Fed cut.\n- Get special access to three exclusive \"Top 10 Stocks\" power lists today, updated daily.\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate Stephen Miran, current chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill the recently vacated Federal Reserve Board seat left by Adriana Kugler.\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Miran would serve until Jan. 31, 2026, giving him a short but potentially impactful window to vote on U.S. monetary policy.\nFrom Policy Newcomer To Trump Economic Power Player: Who Is Miran?\nUntil last year, Miran was a little-known figure in U.S. policymaking.\nHe built his career in investment firms before catching Trump's attention with a series of pro-tariff policy papers, including a 41-page trade strategy document he dubbed the \"Mar-a-Lago Accord.\"\nHis rise culminated in late December when Trump tapped him to lead the CEA. A Fed board seat would likely extend his influence from the White House to the central bank's policy decisions.\nMiran\u2019s latest public comments suggest he might lean towards a dovish stance on interest rates.\nMiran has repeatedly highlighted in recent weeks that inflation has been cooling, despite the presence of tariffs.\nOn July 29, he wrote, \"Inflation has consistently come in below expectations. Time for some updating of models.\"\nEarlier in July, he pointed out that since Trump's current term began, core consumer prices have averaged 2.1% annualized, while headline inflation has been 1.8%.\nThose numbers suggest inflation is near the Fed's target, potentially supporting a case for lower rates.\nCME FedWatch data indicate a 93% probability of a 25-basis-point cut in September and a 63% chance of a follow-up cut in October. The nomination will head to the Senate Banking Committee for hearings before a full Senate vote.\nMarket Reactions\nFollowing Trump's nomination of Miran, the U.S. dollar slipped 0.3%, easing from 98.40 to 98. Gold \u2013 as tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust GLD \u2013 surged to $3,400 per ounce as traders increased bets on near-term Fed rate cuts.\nOn Thursday, Trump's economic team was also reported to be considering Fed Governor Christopher Waller \u2014 who dissented in July in favor of a rate cut \u2014 as likely successor to Jerome Powell when his chairmanship ends in 2026.\nThe S&P 500 \u2013 tracked by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO \u2013 ended 0.1% lower at 6,340, while the Nasdaq added 0.3% to finish at 23,390.\nRead Next:\nImage created using artificial intelligence via Midjourney.\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement.

      "text": "Supercharge Your Trading With Benzinga Tools\nRecent Earning News\nEarnings rank as one of the most important fundamental elements that determine a company\u2019s stock price. The earnings of a company refers to its after-tax net income, which can give you a good indication of the company\u2019s future profitability.\nA company\u2019s earnings numbers depict its profitability over a certain period of time, typically a year or a quarterly 3-month period. Most analysts use quarterly earnings as a benchmark to assess a company\u2019s performance.\nThe deviation of earnings from the analyst consensus, also known as the \u201cearnings call\u201d or \u201cconference call\u201d, can have a notable impact on a company\u2019s stock price. The release of better-than-expected earnings numbers should prompt a rally in a stock\u2019s price but the price can sometimes decline as market participants take profits. Remember, too, that an earnings report is paired with other figures and news items to help investors make wise decisions.\nWhat is an Earnings Calendar?\nAn earnings calendar shows the date and time of upcoming financial results of public companies. Analysts, traders and investors keep track of earnings releases by using an earnings calendar. Earnings calendars help traders and investors track the financial performance of the companies and make investment decisions.\nEvery earnings announcement will have different implications for the stock market, and taking note of all the earnings dates for your assets helps you remain abreast of changes in your portfolio. For example, if you have invested in Tesla and the firm plans to increase vehicle production, you need to know. If the share price is lagging and the firm plans a buyback, you need to know that.\nIf an asset in which you invest is correlated with the price of crude oil, you need to hear what the executive team thinks about the oil market.\nThe earnings calendar typically also gives market consensus estimates. Analysts, traders and investors can use this data to make or compare their own projections. It also helps market participants plan their strategies for the earnings release date in advance.\nHow Are Earnings Calculated?\nNet earnings refer to the earnings of a company relevant to its stock price. Net earnings consist of the amount of income earned after mandatory deductions and withholding like federal income tax and money withheld from employees through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA).\nNet earnings equal the sales or revenue of the company minus the cost of sales, expenses, deductions and taxes and get computed over a specific period of time, such as a quarter or year.\nAn example: Consider a company with gross sales of $1,000,000 over a 1-year period. Subtract from that number the cost of goods sold: $600,000, the company\u2019s operating expenses: $160,000, and its tax payments: $40,000 \u2014 a total of $800,000 for that same period.\nThis leaves the company with a net income, profit or earnings amount of $200,000 for the year.\nEarnings reflect the overall financial performance of the company and factor into computing the key earnings per share (EPS) metric that provides an indicator of a company\u2019s profitability. Earnings per share means the company\u2019s profit/loss attributes to each shareholder of the company.\n- General accepted account principles (GAAP) EPS: Calculated by dividing the net income by the number of shares outstanding.\n- Adjusted EPS: Calculated by excluding nonrecurring items from net income and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.\nTwo other types of earnings that are generally reported on a company\u2019s financial statement:\n- Accumulated earnings: Net profits made by a corporation not disbursed to shareholders as dividends but retained and reinvested in the company instead.\n- Retained earnings: Listed as ownership or equity in the company. Retained earnings consist of the total net income of the company over the company\u2019s life that has not been distributed to shareholders. Shareholders can get these funds via a dividend.\nWhy Are Earnings Important?\nEarnings are one of the most important metrics for the valuation of a company\u2019s stock. They can strongly impact a publicly traded company\u2019s stock price because investors base their investment decisions on the company\u2019s recent earnings and their expectations for its future earnings.\nEarnings are often a key factor in investment decisions like whether to hold, buy or sell shares in the company. They also help investors estimate the short and long term performance of the company and identify whether a company is suitable for the portfolio based on investment objectives.\nNew companies and those that report negative earnings may appear at first glance to be high-risk investments. Keep in mind, however, that some highly successful companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) started out with years of negative earnings before turning profitable.\nCompanies that have recently gone public (and have a new and engaging product or service) also typically go through a period of negative earnings before they become profitable. Insightful investors often buy up these promising stocks despite the fact that the associated companies show negative earnings. If a company eventually begins to make money, the associated rise in share price will generally justify their initial investment with increased capital gains on their stock.\nOther important metrics:\n- Earnings per share (EPS): A metric that provides a key indicator of a company\u2019s profitability. Earnings per share means the company\u2019s profit/loss attributable to each shareholder of the company.\n- Total revenue: Total revenue reveals the amount of money the company takes in from its sales of either goods or services. Depending on the company\u2019s expenses and other outlays, a rise in total revenue can lead to increased earnings.\n- EBIT: Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is one of the most important metrics stock analysts consider because it takes into account the company\u2019s net income before deducted interest and taxes. Many analysts consider the EBIT growth as more important than total revenue growth since it provides a broader picture of the company\u2019s profitability.\n- Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or PER): This important metric gives you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued in relation to its earnings. A high P/E ratio could mean that a company\u2019s stock is currently overvalued or that expectations of higher earnings are already included in the stock\u2019s current price. A low PER could indicate either that the stock is undervalued or that the company\u2019s business model cannot sustain higher earnings, so its share price has fallen although earnings have not been affected yet.\nDepending on the type of stock, the PER could be extremely high but is considered justified by the market due to the company\u2019s future prospects and/or high rate of growth. For example, tech and biotech stocks typically carry a high PER due to investor expectations of substantial future profitability.\nIs it Better to Buy Stocks Before or After Earnings?\nDeciding whether to buy stock before or after an earnings release depends on your investment objectives. For example, if you are a short term trader and want to make a quick profit, then you might buy before the earnings release to speculate on significant stock movement occurring on earnings day.\nOn the other hand, if you are a long-term investor, then you might wait for the earnings to include the latest earnings into your investment model so that you can better estimate the company\u2019s long-term performance.\nMany stocks go through a period of low activity ahead of announcing earnings. This makes sense since institutional investors typically prefer to wait for a positive earnings release before committing more capital.\nAs a rule of thumb, many investors avoid buying shares ahead of an earnings release because of the uncertainty and extra risk involved. An exception could involve using an option strategy to establish a limited risk position in a stock that could also benefit from increased market volatility.\nCompanies generally release earnings before or after the market closes. If released before the opening, the earnings result typically increases the volatility of the stock during the day of its release. If earnings are released after the market closes, the stock price may show increased volatility in the after market, but this usually normalizes by the time the market opens the next day.\nWhen a Company Beats Expected Earnings\nAccording to general market theory, a favorable earnings release that beats the analyst consensus should have a positive impact on the company\u2019s stock price, while an unfavorable release should have a negative impact.\nFor example, if a company announces better quarterly earnings than the analyst consensus expected, then the company\u2019s stock price generally increases. Conversely, if the company announces earnings that fall short of analyst expectations, then the company\u2019s stock comes under selling pressure.\nWhile this makes perfect sense to most people, this generality does not always occur for a number of reasons. Sometimes the price can go down even though a company beats the expected earnings.\n- For example, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) might beat analysts\u2019 EPS estimation but miss their number of iPhone sales estimation. In another instance, Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) might beat the market\u2019s consensus EPS estimation but miss its subscriber growth expectation. In both cases, the stock price might decline despite an unexpected rise in earnings.\n- Another reason for a diverging stock price from a positive or negative earnings release are the rumors spread among savvy market participants ahead of the release. Such rumors can prompt traders and investors to take positions in advance of the official earnings announcement.\n- For example, a company\u2019s stock might rally significantly before a better than expected earnings release but subsequently sells off after the release. You can attribute this to the market having responded to the favorable news spread as a rumor by already discounting it by the time the earnings actually become known to the general public. This is the reasoning behind the old Wall Street adage of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact.\u201d\nFurthermore, the hype generated by public expectations leading up to the day of the better than expected earnings release can also spark technical buying in the stock ahead of the release. Once the earnings have been made public, shareholders take profits by selling the stock they had previously purchased ahead of the earnings release date, thereby causing the stock price to perhaps surprisingly decline on the good news.\nThis common scenario can also arise when a company releases lower than expected earnings. In the case of a lower-than-expected earnings call, the stock can subsequently rally as short sellers take profits and investors interpret the negative news as a buying opportunity.\nHow to Make Money Trading the Earnings Calendar\nThe earnings calendar shows when each company is due to release their quarterly earnings press releases. The stock price ideally goes up when a company beats earnings estimates and goes down when it misses estimates, although exceptions do exist.\n- As the earnings date approaches, traders and investors can focus on how closely the analyst consensus for the reported earnings matches the actual number by looking at the earnings beat or miss on the earnings day.\n- Many stock operators also examine a company\u2019s history of earnings releases. If the company has consistently beaten analyst estimates over several quarters and the stock has rallied on each of the earnings releases and a positive release is expected, then the trader or investor can feel confident in a decision to buy the stock before the earnings release.\n- Other ways to profit from an earnings release with limited risk is to purchase options. A straddle or strangle involving the purchase of both a put and a call could be profitable if the volatility increases as the earnings date approaches.\nThe upside of this type of bidirectional option strategy is that the buyer of the straddle stands to make money regardless of the direction the stock may take after the earnings are released, as long as the move is significant and implied volatility does not collapse before they can trade out of the position.\nWhen is Earnings Season?\nEarnings season means the time when many large publicly traded companies report their financial results. Federal securities laws require companies to disclose information and file financial statements within 45 days of the end of a financial quarter or year.\nThe time period that corresponds to earnings season therefore comes around every quarter. It typically begins 1 or 2 weeks after the end of the last month of each quarter in March, June, September and December."

      "text": "- Trump advisers favor Waller for Fed Chair after his July push for an immediate 25-basis-point rate cut.\n- His odds on Kalshi surged to 51%, ahead of Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh.\n- Get ahead of next week\u2019s CPI & PPI with Chris Capre\u2019s live trading strategy session this Sunday. Register Now \u2192\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller is now seen as the frontrunner to replace Jerome Powell as the next Fed chair, according to sources close to the Trump team.\n- GLD ETF is moving fast. Check live prices here.\nThe pick reflects a growing divide inside the Federal Reserve and Trump's clear preference for a more aggressive rate-cut stance.\nNotably, Waller dissented at the July FOMC meeting, advocating for an immediate 25-basis-point rate cut, directly opposing Powell and the majority, who voted to hold.\nWaller Gains Momentum With Trump Team\nAdvisers close to Trump say they were impressed not only by Waller's call to cut rates in July, but also by his broader economic philosophy: making policy decisions based on forecasts, rather than lagging data.\nHis extensive experience within the Federal Reserve System, including roles at the St. Louis Fed and academic institutions, only strengthens his standing.\nWaller has reportedly held conversations with Trump's team about the role but has not yet met with the former president directly. Still, the shift in focus is visible in prediction markets.\nOn the Kalshi betting platform, Waller's odds of becoming the next Fed Chair spiked by over 30 percentage points, hitting 51%, while other contenders like Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh trail at 30% and 24%, respectively.\nWhy Waller Dissented\u2014And What That Means\nIn a detailed statement issued after the July meeting, Waller laid out his reasoning for wanting to cut rates now\u2014not later.\nHe indicated that tariffs are causing only temporary price hikes, not sustained inflation, and that the Fed should \"look through\" these short-term effects.\n\"The labor market looks fine on the surface,\" Waller said, \"but private-sector payroll growth is near stall speed.\"\nWaller pointed to GDP growth of just 1.2% in the first half of 2025, soft consumer spending, and underlying inflation that was hovering near the target when adjusted for tariffs. He warned that the Fed's current stance is still well above neutral, placing the policy rate 125 to 150 basis points above the long-run rate estimate of 3%.\n\"When labor markets turn, they often turn fast,\" he said. \"Waiting may unduly delay moving toward appropriate policy.\"\nHe added that the Fed should avoid falling behind the curve, especially when it has the option to cut now and reassess later.\nWhat Trump Wants From The Fed\nWaller's proactive stance on rates aligns with Trump's broader economic message heading into 2026: keep inflation in check without choking off growth.\nAs tariffs continue to weigh on prices, Trump's team appears focused on finding a Fed Chair who is less reactionary and more forward-looking.\nThat puts Waller in the ideal position\u2014an insider who isn't afraid to dissent, and someone who believes the Fed should act before the economy shows deeper cracks.\nWhile no decision is final, and Waller hasn't been formally nominated, momentum is clearly shifting in favor of him.\nNow Read:\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "The U.S. economy is heading towards a period of stagflation, warns economist Savvas Savouri. This could have significant implications for the dollar, bonds, and stocks.\nDollar to Fall, Inflation to Rise, Savouri Warns\nSavouri, the managing director of QuantMetriks, predicts a future where inflation rises, the dollar falls, and the yield curve steepens, reported MarketWatch. His forecasts are based on three main inflationary pressures: a weakening dollar, limitations on cheap migrant labor, and increased tariffs.\nSavouri believes that the effects of tariffs have not yet been fully realized in the data. \u201cIf you look through the front windscreen rather than the rear-view mirror, it\u2019s clear to see stagflation is coming to the U.S.,\u201d he stated\nIn a note titled \u201cThe Inflationator vs The Powell,\u201d Savouri predicts that the pressure from the White House could lead to a shorter tenure for Powell at the Federal Reserve.\nHe is bearish on the dollar, foreseeing a \u201cWile E. Coyote moment\u201d before it falls. He also predicts a deal between Trump and China\u2019s president Xi Jinping that will allow an appreciation of renminbi, making U.S. goods more competitive.\nHe advises investors to hedge against these potential adverse movements by buying TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) and suggests that these developments could benefit certain stocks, particularly large caps or big tech with a strong balance sheet and significant portion of their earnings overseas. These are also the companies who can pass on the costs to the consumers.\nWarnings of U.S. Economy Nearing Recession Grow\nThe economist\u2019s warnings come at a time when the US economy is already facing significant challenges. Moody\u2019s Chief Economist Mark Zandi recently warned that the American economy is on the brink of a recession, citing disappointing economic data releases.\nThese concerns were further exacerbated by the July Jobs report, which raised fears of the U.S. economy being close to \u201cstall speed\u201d and potentially tipping into a recession.\nFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook also expressed concern about the report, highlighting the substantial downward revisions to the job numbers for May and June as \u201ctypical of turning points\u201d in the economy.\nREAD MORE:\nImage via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
