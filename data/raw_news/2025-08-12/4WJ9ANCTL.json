  "description": "How much better will the Patriots' O-line be? Will Drake Maye take a huge leap forward? Will TreVeyon Henderson see enough snaps?",
  "content": "FOXBORO, Mass. \u2014 The New England Patriots spent much of Monday prepping for a couple of joint practices with the Minnesota Vikings. The scout-team defense wore jersey numbers to reflect the Vikings\u2019 top players (like safety Harrison Smith) so Drake Maye and others can anticipate what\u2019s awaiting them.\n\nThat\u2019s because, in Minnesota, this Patriots offense will face its toughest and likely most revealing few days before the season begins. Brian Flores\u2019 defense is hard to read and effective. It makes life awfully difficult for offensive lines and quarterbacks, so it\u2019ll be revealing to see how the Patriots handle it.\n\nThe last couple of practices weren\u2019t great for the offense. They struggled to move the ball both Sunday and Monday. Now, as they prepare for the joint practices that loom during the most important week of training camp, let\u2019s take stock of what we know about the Patriots so far \u2014 and what we still don\u2019t know.\n\nWe know: The starting O-line configuration\n\nOver the last two weeks, it has become clear how the Patriots plan to roll out their new-look offensive line. From left to right, they\u2019ll go Will Campbell, Jared Wilson, Garrett Bradbury, Mike Onwenu and Morgan Moses.\n\nThe competition at left guard was quickly won by Wilson. Bradbury has fended off any challenges to his job as Maye\u2019s starting center. So this group seems pretty set.\n\nThat gives the Patriots four new starters from last year\u2019s offensive line with Onwenu as the lone holdover, though he\u2019s back to his more comfortable right guard spot after mostly playing right tackle a year ago.\n\nWe don\u2019t know: How much better the O-line will be\n\nBehind the scenes, coaches have expressed a lot of confidence and optimism in what they have on the O-line. They\u2019ve been impressed by what Moses has brought both on the field and in helping younger players off the field. They\u2019ve been blown away by how quickly Wilson has grasped the system. And they\u2019re happy with the positive moments Campbell has provided, including a pancake block in the preseason opener.\n\nStill, I\u2019m a bit skeptical about two rookies next to each other protecting Maye\u2019s blind side. And how Bradbury is going to hold up at center.\n\nThe offensive line can\u2019t be any worse than last year. I just think they\u2019re going to have ups and downs and probably end up as, say, the 20th-best unit in the league.\n\nWe know: The Patriots have two good receivers\n\nDeMario Douglas has been awesome this training camp. He\u2019s everywhere and a frequent target of Maye. Add to that Stefon Diggs \u2014 who doesn\u2019t look like a guy in his 30s, only nine months removed from an ACL tear \u2014 and the Patriots have a pair of receivers they can trust.\n\nDouglas seems like the perfect shifty slot receiver to thrive in Josh McDaniels\u2019 offense. Diggs, even if he\u2019s no longer in his prime, is still a good route runner.\n\nWe don\u2019t know: Who steps up behind them\n\nThe optimistic view is that several different receivers have had nice days that make you think they could be the Patriots\u2019 No. 3 receiver. But the pessimistic view is that none have stepped up to claim that role in no-doubt fashion.\n\nMack Hollins is a possession receiver with size they otherwise lack. Kayshon Boutte has been solid and can play a lot of different roles. Kyle Williams has deep-threat upside. But so far, it\u2019s not clear which of those three deserves to be the No. 3 option.\n\nWe know: Drake Maye has had some nice moments\n\nThe scramble for a touchdown in the preseason game was impressive. A couple of his deep balls in practice look effortless (even if they\u2019re not always caught).\n\nWith Maye, the physical traits are obvious. You watch him practice, and he seems like a sure thing to be a good NFL quarterback. And yet \u2026\n\nWe don\u2019t know: How ready he is for the Year 2 leap\n\nAfter he had the worst supporting cast of any rookie quarterback last season, plenty anticipate a major leap for Maye. And it could happen. But I wouldn\u2019t say that training camp has been so good for Maye that he\u2019s ready to make a jump into the top-10 (or even 15) quarterbacks this season.\n\nI\u2019m still very bullish on Maye long term. But this offensive line is going to hit some bumps in the road, and the wide receiver situation could get bleak if Diggs or Douglas gets hurt or Williams doesn\u2019t develop.\n\nWe know: Vrabel is shaking up the defensive starters\n\nBased on the last two practices, Kyle Dugger is a backup safety on this team. Marte Mapu probably won\u2019t make the final roster. Jahlani Tavai is a bubble player. Same for Anfernee Jennings.\n\nWe know Vrabel overhauled the roster in the offseason and didn\u2019t keep many players from last year\u2019s unit. But a few weeks into camp, a few more holdovers are losing playing time \u2014 and might not make the team at all.\n\nWe don\u2019t know: How effective the pass rush will be\n\nThere have been some impressive showings from K\u2019Lavon Chaisson and Keion White as outside pass rushers. But I\u2019m excited to see how they look against Vikings tackle Brian O\u2019Neill during joint practices. That should let us know if they\u2019re really headed for breakout seasons \u2014 or if they\u2019ve just benefited from going against the Patriots O-line.\n\nWe know: TreVeyon Henderson is a big-play machine\n\nIt looked that way before Friday\u2019s preseason opener, but now there\u2019s no getting around it. A team that has had such little explosiveness on offense finally has a player who can break through for a big gain even when everything else feels stuck in the mud. That should make a big difference this season and might make Henderson the most exciting player to watch on offense.\n\nWe don\u2019t know: How many snaps he\u2019ll actually get\n\nI\u2019m confident at this point that Henderson will get half of the running back snaps this season.\n\nBut Vrabel has publicly backed Rhamondre Stevenson several times and seems inclined to at least try out a running back committee.\n\nBut if Henderson keeps playing like this (and if Stevenson\u2019s ball security continues to be an issue), that could change in a hurry.",

      "text": "The Patriots\u2019 preseason opener went remarkably well. You could quibble with a few things, as Mike Vrabel did, but for the most part, a 48-18 win over the Commanders checked all the boxes. The Patriots head to Minnesota this week for a pair of practices and then an exhibition game against the Vikings.\nAdvertisement\nBut the success of Friday does make for some tougher decisions when looking at the depth chart. So today, let\u2019s reset with a projection for what the 53-man roster might look like.\nQuarterbacks (2)\nIn: Drake Maye, Joshua Dobbs\nOut: Ben Wooldridge\nMaye\u2019s preseason debut was similar to his training camp: There were a lot of positives, but it came without downfield passing to receivers, and it did include one botched play when Maye fumbled on the opening drive (which Vrabel bemoaned). Still, Maye\u2019s scrambling ability is such a threat on third downs, and it\u2019s probably wise to avoid making too much of two possessions in a preseason opener.\nRunning backs (4)\nIn: Rhamondre Stevenson, TreVeyon Henderson, Antonio Gibson, Terrell Jennings\nOut: JaMycal Hasty\nHenderson is a stud. It will take time to fully evaluate the rest of the Patriots\u2019 draft class, but at this point it would be a shock if Henderson didn\u2019t become a good player. He\u2019s been the most electric weapon the Patriots have in training camp, and that was on full display during the preseason opener. Gibson, too, contributed with a big kickoff; his roster spot seems safe. Lan Larison suffered a season-ending injury, which is disappointing after a strong preseason debut, but it could open Jennings up to make the team if he plays well the next two weeks.\nWide receivers (6)\nIn: Stefon Diggs, DeMario Douglas, Kayshon Boutte, Mack Hollins, Kyle Williams, Javon Baker\nOut: Ja\u2019Lynn Polk, Kendrick Bourne, Efton Chism, John Jiles, Jeremiah Webb\nBaker wasn\u2019t able to do much offensively in the team\u2019s preseason game, but he drew praise from Vrabel for making a pair of special-teams tackles; after some nice practices last week, he\u2019s probably done enough to make the team at this point. Williams ran some impressive routes, but the passes were not always crisp so he did not register a catch on four targets Friday. They\u2019d love Polk to push for a spot since no team wants to cut last year\u2019s second-round pick, but he appeared to suffer an injury Friday night, which further hurts his chances at making the team.\nAdvertisement\nTight ends (3)\nIn: Hunter Henry, Austin Hooper, Jack Westover\nOut: Gee Scott, Jaheim Bell, Jack Westover, C.J. Dippre, Cole Fotheringham\nTrying to pick a third tight end is still difficult. Clearly, the team wants three since they came out for their opening play with three tight ends, but no one is separating from the competition. Still, we\u2019re going with Westover since he provides flexibility as someone who can line up at fullback as well.\nOffensive line (10)\nIn: Will Campbell, Jared Wilson, Garrett Bradbury, Mike Onwenu, Morgan Moses, Marcus Bryant, Cole Strange, Demontrey Jacobs, Ben Brown, Caedan Wallace\nOut: Layden Robinson, Sidy Sow, Alec Lindstrom, Tyrese Robinson, Mekhi Butler, Jack Conley, Vederian Lowe\nAfter the first preseason game, it seems the starting five is pretty close to set (it\u2019s those first five names listed). The questions now come at backup center (is it Brown or Strange?) and in picking the depth guards. Campbell and Wilson struggled to pick up a stunt on Friday, but such is life with rookies; for the most part, they\u2019ve done what the Patriots have asked and are off to promising starts heading into a big week with three matchups against Brian Flores\u2019 defense.\nDefensive line (10)\nIn: Milton Williams, Christian Barmore, Keion White, Khyiris Tonga, Joshua Farmer, Harold Landry, K\u2019Lavon Chaisson, Bradyn Swinson, Truman Jones, Elijah Ponder\nOut: Anfernee Jennings, Jahvaree Ritzie, David Olajiga, Isaiah Iton, Jereme Robinson\nTonga has been an impressive player in practices, clogging running lanes and setting things up for Robert Spillane. White has been up and down. Barmore and Williams have been about what you\u2019d expect. Chiasson has had some really nice moments. But the surprise here is Jennings. It doesn\u2019t seem the new coaching staff is as big a fan of his edge-setting ability as previous ones, part of why he was still on the field in the fourth quarter Friday. That\u2019s not typically a great sign for someone\u2019s hopes of making the roster.\nAdvertisement\nLinebackers (4)\nIn: Robert Spillane, Christian Elliss, Jack Gibbens, Jahlani Tavai\nOut: Marte Mapu, Monty Rice, Cam Riley, R.J. Moten\nThis is still a little lighter than you\u2019d like from your linebacker position, especially since this is a group that typically contributes quite a bit to special teams. But no one from the bottom of the depth chart has really stood out, and keeping just four linebackers here allows for more safeties \u2014 a position where the Pats have a lot of depth.\nCornerbacks (5)\nIn: Christian Gonzalez, Carlton Davis, Marcus Jones, Alex Austin, DJ James\nOut: Tre Avery, Isaiah Bolden, Kobee Minor, Miles Battle, Jordan Polk, Brandon Crossley\nThis group feels pretty set. The only real question is whether anyone toward the bottom of the depth chart can do enough to convince the Patriots to keep a sixth corner (or, if the health of Gonzalez or Davis necessitates it). If not, the Patriots like what they\u2019ve seen from Austin and James while Gonzalez and Davis have been out with injuries.\nSafeties (6)\nIn: Jabrill Peppers, Kyle Dugger, Jaylinn Hawkins, Craig Woodson, Marcus Epps, Brenden Schooler\nOut: Dell Pettus\nIn this projection, the last spot came down to whether you keep Epps and have a bloated safety group, or whether you keep a fifth linebacker. The fact that a linebacker just hasn\u2019t stepped up enough to earn it plays in Epps\u2019 favor. There is some concern about Dugger at this point, but Hawkins has been playing great and Woodson isn\u2019t far behind, so this group is pretty solid.\nSpecial teams (3)\nIn: Andres Borregales, Bryce Baringer, Julian Ashby\nOut: John Parker Romo\nIt\u2019s a good problem to have, but both Borregales and Romo are even because they keep making their kicks. This will likely get sorted out over the next two weeks, but if it\u2019s a true tie, the Pats probably go with Borregales considering they used a sixth-round pick on him.\n(Photo of Ja\u2019Lynn Polk: Paul Rutherford / Imagn Images)"
