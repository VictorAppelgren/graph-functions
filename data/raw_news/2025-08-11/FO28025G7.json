      "text": "How Canada\u2019s \u2018grey wave\u2019 is making seniors\u2019 housing the hottest real estate play in town\nDespite recent strength, shadow of pandemic and questions about privatized care linger\nWhile other real estate categories such as offices and apartments are still struggling, the senior housing sector has been experiencing a surprising rebound, fuelled by Canada\u2019s aging population.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic rocked the real estate world five years ago, senior homes and their residents were hit the hardest. Thousands of outbreaks and deaths occurred in Canadian long-term care homes and several lawsuits emerged in the aftermath, alleging negligence and inadequate care.\nThe publicly-traded companies behind some of these homes saw a sharp increase in operating costs, while occupancy rates fell due to COVID-related restrictions and outbreak fears.\nBut in the following years, closures of older residences and a slowdown in new construction have tightened supply.\n\u201cThe cost to build new retirement homes has effectively doubled, and that higher cost has crowded out a lot of that development activity,\u201d said Sean McCrorie, vice-chair and the Canadian seniors housing and healthcare practice group leader for Cushman & Wakefield\u2019s valuation and advisory group. \u201cOn the demand side \u2026 our population is getting older, and people are, on average, living longer.\u201d\nThat combination has made senior housing the best performing real estate sector on the S&P/TSX composite index to date this year, said Dean Orrico, president and chief executive of Middlefield Limited, an independent equity income specialist headquartered in Toronto.\nSo far this year, shares of Sienna Senior Living Inc. have risen 19 per cent, Chartwell Retirement Residences are up 20 per cent and Extendicare Inc. have gained nearly 21 per cent. Returns for these major senior housing companies significantly outperformed the return for real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the S&P/TSX Composite, which were up by just six per cent this year.\nIt\u2019s a dynamic that analysts don\u2019t expect to change any time soon.\n- Opinion: Everyone benefits from an expanded Seniors' Tax Credit\n- Lowering the age for public pension eligibility reduces senior poverty rates: report\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nCanada\u2019s senior population aged 75 and older is expected to grow by more than 45 per cent to around 5.3 million people in the next decade, driving greater need for senior housing, according to a March reportfrom Cushman & Wakefield.\nMcCrorie said Cushman & Wakefield is anticipating senior housing occupancy to hit pre-pandemic levels of about 92 per cent this year and trend upward to about 95 per cent next year.\nThe firm also projects the sector will require 200,000 senior housing suites (excluding long-term care beds) to be built in the next decade to keep pace with demand. But in the past decade, only 73,000 suites were developed, and there are less than 10,000 under construction currently.\nOrrico said some of the core Canadian names in the senior housing market are performing extremely well, driven by solid fundamentals.\nCushman & Wakefield predicted 2025 would be a record-setting year for deal making in seniors housing in Canada, as investors \u201ccapitalize on the exceptional fundamentals and expected outperformance of the asset class over the next 20 years.\u201d\nMcCrorie said each year, there are typically $2 billion to $4 billion in property trades in the senior housing sector across Canada.\nHe added there are often for-profit private firms purchasing these properties, though certain markets may see interest from pension funds or private equity investors.\n\u201cOver the last 12 to 18 months, it\u2019s predominantly been the publicly traded entities, public companies, that have been doing a lot of the buying,\u201d he said.\nIn July, Chartwell said it would purchase six senior and retirement communities, with a total of 1,024 suites, for $432 million across southwestern Ontario, \u201cto capitalize on growing demand for high-quality retirement living in the region.\u201d This came after an announcement earlier that month that Chartwell would be expanding its footprint in Quebec.\nIn April, Sienna finalized its acquisition of four continuing care homes in Alberta (previously announced in October 2024) for $181.6 million.\nOrrico said it\u2019s important to distinguish between long-term care homes and other types of senior housing. He said retirement homes are more susceptible to movements within the economy as they require private pay, compared to long-term care homes which are significantly subsidized by the provincial government and offer lower but more predictable returns.\nIn the case of, say, Chartwell\u2019s retirement homes, which charge about $6,000 a month for a resident, Orrico said the company has the potential to generate higher returns, but demand could change based on whether seniors can continue to afford them.\nSusan Braedley, a professor at Carleton University\u2019s School of Social Work whose research interests include the quality of long-term care, said long-term care homes do not operate within typical market forces, as they are based on need, rather than consumer demand.\nThe care in long-term care homes is government-funded, while costs are provincially regulated at set rates. They also require medical professionals and staff with specific skills to address the kind of care these seniors need and require assessments to determine a senior\u2019s eligibility.\nStill, Braedley said, it\u2019s often the same companies that are involved in the various types of senior housing.\n\u201cLong-term care homes are owned by a variety of public ownership,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, in Ontario, that\u2019s municipalities, non-profits and for-profits \u2014 all three of these owners may also own retirement homes.\u201d\nAccording to the Cushman & Wakefield report, long-term care homes are outpacing the growth of other types of senior housing.\nBut Braedley said there remain concerns about for-profit companies owning this type of housing.\nA Statistics Canada report published in July that collected data from 2020 and 2021 revealed public long-term care facilities had higher staffing levels and spent a greater proportion of their total costs on employee wages and benefits before and during the pandemic, compared with both for-profit and non-profit private facilities.\nThe report also found for-profit nursing homes provided residents with fewer minutes of direct care per day compared to public homes before and during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe companies that had the highest rates of death and worst rates of infection in Ontario during the pandemic are the exact firms who have received huge contracts today,\u201d added Braedley.\nA 2021 report from the University of Waterloo found for-profit long-term care homes had worse patient outcomes than not-for-profit homes during the pandemic. It showed Canada\u2019s top 10 financial firms doubled their holdings of long-term care homes since 2003, while about a third of seniors\u2019 housing (including 22 per cent of long-term care and 42 per cent of retirement homes) is owned by financial firms.\nOntario had the highest proportion of for-profit long-term care beds as of 2020.\nMartine August, an associate professor at the university\u2019s School of Planning and author of the report, said there\u2019s been escalating need for long-term care for seniors with acute medical needs, especially after Ontario\u2019s Bill 7 passed in 2022 to free up hospital beds.\nBill 7, or the More Beds, Better Care Act, allows hospitals to move people into long-term care homes (that are not necessarily of their choosing), or charge them $400 a day if they refuse.\nIn the meantime, she said firms have realized there\u2019s a \u201cgrey wave\u201d of older Canadians who have accumulated wealth through their homes, assets and pensions, which they must draw from to afford the costs of retirement living.\n\u201cWhen the government steps back, the private sector is filling that void,\u201d she said.\nThe latest data from the Ontario Long Term Care Association showed wait lists for long-term care in the province have doubled over the past decade to about 48,000 and are projected to surpass 50,000 this year.\nI think the senior housing REITs continue to be a good bet because they have this inherent demand\nMcCrorie said funding is improving. In 2021, the Ontario government committed $4.9 billion to hire over 27,000 long-term care staff over four years and ensure residents receive on average four hours of direct care per day by 2024-25.\nMcCrorie also said there is no financial disincentive to hire fewer employees, since these dollars are specifically earmarked for nursing and personal care services. The challenge is finding and retaining qualified staff.\nMcCrorie said that although need for senior housing would continue to remain strong in an economic downturn, a hypothetical decline in home values could make it difficult for older Canadians to tap their equity or sell to afford the costs of a private-pay retirement home.\nIn Chartwell\u2019s 2024 annual report, it noted that general business risks included economic conditions, increased labour and operating costs and the inability to afford residency fees (including anticipated increases in such fees).\nIt also mentioned that its revenue and operating results \u201cdepend significantly\u201d on occupancy levels at Chartwell\u2019s residences, and increased competition or \u201coversupply\u201d in the local market could adversely impact its ability to find residents who can meet these homes\u2019 rental rates.\nOrrico said another potential risk would include a significant move in interest rates, which would affect the overall real estate sector. A spike in long-term rates, for example, would prevent REITs from renewing their debt at a lower rate.\nStill, he expects interest rates to trend downward into 2026 and has a positive outlook for the senior housing sector moving forward.\n\u201cI think the senior housing REITs continue to be a good bet because they have this inherent demand, by virtue of an aging population (and) limitations on supply,\u201d said Orrico. \u201cOutside of some type of exogenous issue, like a pandemic, I think they continue to be a great place to be invested (in).\u201d\n\u2022 Email: slouis@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Measures of core inflation have hovered around three per cent since April.\nStill, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem left the door open for further rate relief.\n\u201cIf a weakening economy puts further downward pressure on inflation and the upward price pressures from trade disruptions are contained, there may be a need for a reduction in the policy interest rate,\u201d he said on July 30.\nSurvey respondents\u2019 median expectation for headline inflation was 2.2 per cent by the end of 2025 and two per cent by the end of 2026. They also pegged Canada\u2019s gross domestic product growth at 0.8 per cent at year-end and 1.8 per cent by the end of 2026, and they put the probability of a recession in the next six months at 35 per cent.\nNearly 89 per cent of respondents identified an increase in trade tensions as the main downside risk, while 44 per cent said weaker consumer spending and a weaker housing market.\nAbout 90 per cent cited the easing of trade tensions and larger-than-expected fiscal stimulus as their main upside risks to their growth outlook.\n\u2022 Email: jgowling@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Canada could be trade winner as U.S. tariffs undershoot global competitors by wide margin, says report\nOxford estimates the U.S.'s current effective tariff rate on Canada is 2.5%\nThe tariff rate imposed on Canadian exports by the United States is estimated to be the lowest amongst the world\u2019s trading countries, meaning that Canada could end up coming out ahead in Donald Trump\u2018s trade war, a new report says.\nOxford Economics Group Ltd. estimates the U.S.\u2019s current effective tariff rate on Canada is 2.5 per cent, placing it below Mexico at four per cent and well below other major U.S. trading partners.\nFor example, the U.S. tariff rate is 35 per cent on China, 15 per cent on Japan, 13 per cent on South Korea and eight per cent on the United Kingdom and the European Union, based on data from calculated duties as a share of imports, Oxford said.\n\u201cIf the relatively low tariffs apparently being paid on imports from Mexico and Canada persist, these two economies could pick up some benefits from shifts in supply chains, although uncertainties over the endgame for tariffs and the future of the (Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement) will be near-term drags,\u201d Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in the report.\nCUSMA-compliant goods escape U.S. tariffs, though the trade agreement is scheduled to be reviewed in July 2026, but some people, including Ontario Premier Doug Ford, think that deadline could be accelerated.\nStill, Slater described the current estimates for the tariff rates \u201cas something of a puzzle.\u201d\nOne set of trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that 56 per cent of goods entering the U.S. from Canada and 47 per cent from Mexico are compliant with CUSMA, while other Census Bureau data suggests the rates are 91 per cent and 84 per cent, respectively.\n\u201cIt may be the case that tariff exemptions for these economies are broader than assumed,\u201d Slater said.\n- Canadian steelmakers need to focus on domestic market as tariffs lock them out of U.S.: Algoma CEO\n- Trump put a tariff on gold \u2014 or did he? What you need to know about the bullion confusion\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nSlater said Oxford based its overall 2.5 per cent tariff rate for Canada on a higher level of CUSMA compliance, \u201cwhile not directly\u201d adhering to the 91 per cent level.\nBut trade between the U.S. and Canada hasn\u2019t escaped unscathed.\n\u201cThe biggest negative impacts have been in Canada, where imports are down 25 per cent from January levels, and in China, where imports are down 50 per cent from January,\u201d Slater said, adding that \u201cChinese data on exports to the U.S. shows a much less dramatic decline of around 25 per cent since January,\u201d possibly due to rerouting of goods through other countries.\nIn Canada, 50 per cent tariffs on aluminum and steel exports to the U.S. persist, as do 25 per cent tariffs on the non-U.S. components of vehicles. Trump also recently hiked the tariff on non-CUSMA-compliant goods to 35 per cent from 25 per cent and announced an increased tariff on softwood lumber to 35 per cent.\nOxford\u2019s report also warned that overall global trade is shrinking.\n\u201cA variety of indicators suggest that world trade is weakening,\u201d Slater said, referencing various measures that indicated monthly global imports slowed three per cent in April and May, while an International Monetary Fund port tracker said growth in international exports declined to less than one per cent.\n\u201cOther sea and air freight indicators show similar trends,\u201d he said.\nOxford is estimating that world trade volumes shrunk by about three per cent from the second quarter to the first quarter of 2026, with world trade posting its weakest performance in a four-year period since the recession of the early 1980s.\nIt reduced its global gross domestic product estimate to 2.5 per cent \u2014 \u201chistorically on the low side\u201d \u2014 to 2.8 per cent from 2.9 per cent at the beginning of the year, Slater said.\n\u2022 Email: gmvsuhanic@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Posthaste: Canadians are overlooking 'wonderful buy-and-hold stocks that are in plain sight,' says CIBC\nHalf of TSX's market cap is companies that offer attractive returns for the set-and-forget portfolio\nLong gone are the days when Canada\u2019s stock market could be described as the home for \u201chewers of wood, drawers of water.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the opinion of CIBC Capital Markets analysts who say that because of the large share of commodity stocks on the S&P/TSX, Canadian investors too often assume that there are limited alternatives for a \u201cset and forget\u201d portfolio.\n\u201cWe believe that over half the market capitalization of the S&P/TSX is comprised of companies that should provide investors with stable, attractive returns over the long term,\u201d said CIBC\u2019s Ian de Verteuil.\nLong-established buy-and-hold candidates are what CIBC calls Canada\u2019s \u201coligopolies,\u201d businesses with high market share and limited competition. They include banks, railways, grocers and telecoms, and except for telecoms which has struggled in the past decade, returns have beaten the TSX and over longer periods the S&P 500.\nThe mere 15 companies in these sectors have on average made up 30 per cent of the TSX\u2019s market capitalization, 35 per cent of dividends and 25 per cent of buybacks.\nIn the past these stocks have had \u201cexcellent \u201cbuy-and-hold\u201d characteristics,\u201d said de Verteuil. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any reason why this shouldn\u2019t continue into the future.\u201d\nBut the report also identifies four groups of stocks that have or are developing competitive positions that could \u201cchallenge the long-term stock price leadership of the oligopolies.\u201d\nThese \u201cwanna be\u201d oligopolies include life insurance, property & casualty insurance, waste and pipelines \u2014 stocks that now make up about 13 per cent of the market capitalization of the S&P/TSX.\n\u201cUnlike the oligopolies, these businesses have each experienced significant change since the start of the century,\u201d said de Verteuil.\nConsolidation in life insurance has resulted in four large insurers \u2014 Manulife Financial Corp., Sun Life Financial Inc., Great-West, and iA Financial making up over 70 per cent of the Canadian market.\nWaste has also seen consolidation to the point where two waste management stocks now represent 2 per cent of the TSX market cap.\nThe industry is not as concentrated as the oligopolies, but has strong regional market positions, and plenty of opportunity for the big players to make acquisitions. Stocks include GFL Environmental Inc. and Waste Connections Inc.\nPipelines, or energy infrastructure companies, have close comparisons to CIBC\u2019s \u201ccash flow\u201d oligopolies. Like telecoms, they are capital intensive, their services are essential like grocers and they serve an important role in the logistics of the Canadian economy, like railways.\nThe \u201cwanna-be oligopolies\u201d are a welcome development for individual and institutional shareholders, said de Verteuil.\n\u201cCanada needs more \u201cbuy-and-hold\u201d type stocks as part of a domestic portfolio \u2014 portfolios that are often overweight in entities with high commodity exposure.\u201d\nThe report also highlights specific stocks that have shown steady growth in their earnings and book value such as Dollarama Inc. and BRP Inc.\nBrookfield Corp. is seen as being set for high single-digit to low double-digit returns over the long run. Shopify Inc. offers faster growth but higher volatility, they said.\nInternational portfolio diversification is still important, said the analysts, especially in IT, consumer and health care sector.\n\u201cBut too many Canadian investors overlook wonderful buy-and-hold options that are in plain sight.\u201d\nSign up here to get Posthaste delivered straight to your inbox.\nA September interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada may be back on the table after jobs data Friday came in weaker than expected.\nCanada\u2019s economy lost 41,000 jobs in July, when economists had forecast a gain of 10,000. The decline was the biggest monthly drop since January 2022, and mostly driven by full-time work.\nThere is still lots of data to come before the central bank makes its decision on Sept. 17, including another jobs report and two inflation readings.\n\u201cHowever, today\u2019s weaker than expected employment figure is nevertheless supportive for our call of a 25bp interest rate reduction at that September meeting,\u201d said Andrew Grantham, senior economist for CIBC Capital Markets.\n- Earnings: Barrick Mining Corp., Franco-Nevada Corp., Orla Mining Ltd.\nWhen planning a vacation, some of the biggest expenses are food, transportation and accommodation.
