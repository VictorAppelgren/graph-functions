  "description": "OneConstruction Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability that, through its operating subsidiary, OneConstruction Engineering Projects Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong with limited liability, operates as a structural steelwork contractor for construction projects in both the public and private sectors in Hong Kong (\"OneConstruction Group\",\"ONEG\" or the \"Company\"), today announced its audited financial results for the fiscal year ended Marc",
  "content": "Administration Expenses: Administration expenses were $2.2 million for FY2025, representing an increase of 153.9% from $0.9 million in FY2024. The increase was attributable to legal and professional fees and other administrative expenses incurred for the initial public offering conducted in FY2025.\n\nCash Position: As of March 31, 2025, the consolidated cash balance decreased to $0.7 million, compared to $1.6 million as of March 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by the cash used in operating activities.\n\nCash Flow: The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 million for FY2025 was mainly attributable to the cash outflow of $5.1 million in operating activities and the cash inflow from financing activities of $4.3 million.\n\nNet Income: Profit after tax for FY2025 decreased to $0.9 million, compared to $1.8 million in FY2024. This reduction was mainly due to a decrease of $0.5 million in profit from operations, an increase of $0.23 million in finance costs and an increase of $0.1 million in income tax expenses during FY2025.\n\nGross Profit: Gross profit for FY2025 was $3.9 million, a decrease of 11.9% compared to $4.4 million in FY2024. However, gross profit margin increased by 0.4 percentage points to 7.4%, compared to 7.0% in FY2024. The increase in gross profit margin was attributable to the award of construction projects in the public sector that provided higher profit margins.\n\nRevenue: Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2025 (\"FY2025\") decreased by 16.2% to $53.2 million, compared to $63.5 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (\"FY2024\"). The decline was attributed to a 14.1% reduction in revenue from the public sector and a decrease of 27.3% in revenue from the private sector. Despite the decrease in total revenue, revenue derived from residential construction projects in the public sector increased by 23.1% from $32.2 million in FY2024 to $39.7 million in FY2025.\n\nNEW YORK, Aug. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- OneConstruction Group Limited , a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability that, through its operating subsidiary, OneConstruction Engineering Projects Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong with limited liability, operates as a structural steelwork contractor for construction projects in both the public and private sectors in Hong Kong ( \" OneConstruction Group \",\" ONEG \" or the \" Company \" ) , today announced its audited financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.\n\u2022 A Top Hong Kong Steelwork Service Provider:\n\n\u207b ONEG is one of the top service providers in the Hong Kong structural steelwork industry with an established reputation and proven track record.\n\u2022 Custom Steelwork Solutions:\n\n\u207b ONEG offers tailored solutions in structural steelwork service designed to meet client needs.\n\n\u207b Leveraging its established network and supplier relationships, ONEG believes it is well-equipped to manage tight timelines and accommodate supplemental orders.\n\n\u207b ONEG' believes that its ability to promptly respond to unforeseen demands and adjust supply and installation schedules enhances its appeal to clients.\n\u2022 Well-Positioned for Public Sector Construction Growth:\n\n\u207b ONEG is primarily engaged in works for the growing public sector.\n\n\u207b According to the Construction Expenditure Forecast prepared by Construction Industry Council of Hong Kong, the construction expenditures for building works in both public and private sectors and civil works in the public sector (i.e., the construction works that most involved the use of structural steelwork) in Hong Kong is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% between 2025 and 2027, despite a recent decline in construction expenditures for the private sector.\n\u2022 Visionary and Experienced Leadership:\n\n\u207b ONEG is led by a visionary and experienced management team with robust technical and operational expertise.\n\n\u207b ONEG's management team, including its executive director and general manager, brings substantial technical and management experience, complemented by extensive industry networks.\n\n\u207b ONEG's strong and dedicated execution team collaborates closely with clients to effectively meet their needs and adapt to market trends.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, ONEG announced the closing of its initial public offering of 1,750,000 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $4.00 per share (the \"Offering\").
