  "title": "Trump Demands Pfizer, Other Covid Drug Makers To 'Justify The Success,' Show Their Results Amid New FDA Restrictions\u2014'Clear Up This Mess' - Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)",
  "description": "President Donald Trump has called for pharmaceutical companies to provide evidence of the effectiveness of their COVID-19 drugs.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump has called for pharmaceutical companies to provide evidence of the effectiveness of their COVID-19 drugs.\n\nTrump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Monday and called on drug companies to \u2018Justify the success\u2019 and disclose their results more openly, stating that this would help to \u201cclear up this MESS.\u201d\n\nHe criticized the companies for not publicly disclosing the extraordinary results he claims to have witnessed, including those of Pfizer Inc. PFE. \u201cThey never seem to show those results to the public. Why not???\u201d Trump questioned.\n\nTrump's push for transparency comes after the FDA introduced new restrictions on COVID-19 vaccine eligibility. The president stressed that pharmaceutical companies must demonstrate the effectiveness of their products, pointing to the ongoing debate over their true impact.\n\nTrump also referenced the ongoing debate surrounding the CDC and its handling of the issue. \u201cWith CDC being ripped apart over this question, I want the answer, and I want it NOW.\u201d\n\nHe continued to praise Operation Warp Speed, his administration\u2019s initiative to speed up the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics during his first term.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump Family-Backed World Liberty Financial Token Crashes After Initial Rise On First Trading Day \u2013 Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) Common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest\n\nThis call for transparency comes amidst a turbulent time for the nation\u2019s health agencies. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently rescinded the emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, causing concern among public health leaders and lawmakers.\n\nThe president's remarks follow his recent dismissal of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez, who had declined to step down voluntarily. Following this, the CDC immunizations chief, Demetre Daskalakis, resigned, citing that politics had overrun science at the CDC.\n\nThis move sparked further resignations and calls for Kennedy\u2019s dismissal. In August, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) urged Trump to take swift action, cautioning that Kennedy's leadership was putting families at risk. In a New York Times essay, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also weighed in, denouncing Kennedy's \"dangerous policies\" and charging him with promoting conspiracy theories that scientific experts have repeatedly \u201cdismissed.\"\n\nLeading vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. MRNA have been under pressure this year. While Moderna stock plunged over 40% on the year-to-date basis, Pfizer has declined 6.95% in a similar period.\n\nBenzinga's Edge Rankings place Pfizer in the 47th percentile for quality and the 35th percentile for value, reflecting its average performance in both areas.

      "text": "The newly tradeable World Liberty Financial (WLFI) token derailed after the initial flourish on Monday.\nWLFI Falters After Initial Burst\nWLFI, the governance token of the Trump family-backed decentralized finance platform, began trading at $0.228 and rose to a high of $0.46 in the next half an hour, according to CoinMarketCap.\nHowever, it retreated sharply during the day, dropping to roughly $0.24 as of this writing, reflecting a 46% decline from the highs. On an intraday basis, the token rose 7.9%.\nMajor cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance listed the token on their platforms. The trading volume skyrocketed past $4 billion in the last 24 hours, making it the ninth-most traded cryptocurrency.\nAs of this writing, it has amassed a market capitalization of over $6 billion. It is available on Ethereum ETH/USD, Binance Chain BNB/USD and Solana SOL/USD.\nSee Also: Bitcoin Sets New All-Time High At $124,000 As Record-Breaking Surge Continues\nThe Supply Dynamics\nWorld Liberty Financial confirmed that the coin's initial circulating supply at launch was 24.67 billion, with 10 billion allocated for ecosystem use, 7.78 billion for ALT5 Sigma Corp. ALTS, which will hold the tokens as part of its treasury, 2.88 billion for liquidity and marketing and 4 billion for public sale, representing the initial unlock.\nIt mentioned that the remaining 80% of tokens would be subject to unlocking schedules.\nTrump\u2019s Family Involvement\nWorld Liberty Financial was launched last year to allow users to borrow, lend and earn interest on funds through the DeFi route. It introduced WLFI as the governance token, but made it unavailable for trading.\nThe Trump family is deeply invested in the project, with President Donald Trump listed as Co-Founder Emeritus, while his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., serve as co-founders.\nAccording to the latest financial disclosure, Trump\u2019s investment in the venture yielded him over $57 million in 2024, positioning it as one of his primary sources of income.\nPhoto Courtesy: T.

      "text": "Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immunizations chief Demetre Daskalakis said Sunday he resigned because politics has overrun science at the nation's top public-health agency, warning he \"only see[s] harm coming\" under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nTop Official\u2019s Resignation Follows CDC Director's Abrupt Ouster Turmoil\nDaskalakis stepped down last week as director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases after HHS removed CDC Director Susan Monarez, a move that set off additional senior exits and condemnation from lawmakers and medical groups.\nDaskalakis Says Ideology Eclipses Science At CDC\n\"From my vantage point as a doctor who's taken the Hippocratic Oath, I only see harm coming. I may be wrong. But based on what I'm seeing, based on what I've heard with the new members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, or ACIP, they're really moving in an ideological direction where they want to see the undoing of vaccination,\" he said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\nSee Also: American Middle Class Hitting The Panic Button? Consumer Sentiment Dives 6% In August\nHe said the line between politics and evidence has vanished. \"I didn't think that we were going to be able to present science in a way free of ideology, that the firewall between science and ideology has completely broken down. And not having a scientific leader at CDC meant that we wouldn't be able to have the necessary diplomacy and connection with HHS to be able to really execute on good public health,\" Daskalakis said.\nPolitical Fallout Grows As Robert Kennedy Jr. Defends Changes\nThe shake-up followed Monarez's ouster less than a month into her tenure. Her attorneys dispute the legality of the firing. Additional CDC leaders, including Debra Houry and Daniel Jernigan, also resigned in protest.\nKennedy has said he aims to \"restore public trust in vaccines,\" and his allies argue he is reconstituting advisory panels to avoid conflicts of interest. He has insisted he is not anti-vaccine, a claim pressed at his Senate confirmation hearings, according to an AP report from January.\nThe turmoil has drawn political fire. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) urged Kennedy's removal over the weekend as CDC resignations mounted, while House Democrats demanded oversight.\nVaccine Stocks In Focus\nDaskalakis' warning that ideology is eclipsing science at HHS/CDC adds policy-risk overhang for vaccine makers, reinforcing investor fears that shifting guidance could curb uptake. Major vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer Inc. PFE and Moderna Inc. MRNA have been under pressure this year. While Moderna stock has tanked over 42% since the year began, Pfizer has dropped 6.95% in a similar period.\nModerna scores poorly in Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings, with an unfavorable price trend in the short, medium and long terms.

He criticized the firms for not publicly sharing results and called for answers amid ongoing CDC leadership turmoil and the rescission of emergency vaccine authorizations by HHS. The call follows Trump\u2019s praise of Operation Warp Speed and coincides with political pressure on vaccine makers that has weighed on Pfizer and Moderna stock performance.",
