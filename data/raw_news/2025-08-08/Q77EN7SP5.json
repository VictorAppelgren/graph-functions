  "description": "ESPN\u2019s NBA insider painted a bleak picture about what it\u2019s like to have a job that\u2019s 24/7.",
  "content": "ESPN NBA insider Shams Charania painted a bleak picture about what it\u2019s like to have a job that\u2019s 24/7.\n\nWhile discussing work/life balance with fellow ESPNers \u2014 reporter Jeremy Schaap, MLB insider Jeff Passan and NFL insider Adam Schefter \u2014 Charania explained that his social life has suffered significantly due to his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to walk out on dates, like I\u2019ve had to walk out on a lot of social events,\u201d Charania said during ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Sports Reporters\u201d on Thursday. \u201cMy friends don\u2019t really like me. That\u2019s why it\u2019s very hard to have a consistent relationship because you know the time that requires and you know the time that they deserve, rightfully. And there are just moments where I\u2019m just always going to choose this as of right now.\u201d\n\nCharania was the only one in the conversation who isn\u2019t married with children.\n\n\u201cShams, I try to find balance, I do my very best,\u201d Passan said. \u201cAnd I have kids, it becomes different at that point. I hope for your sake that you can find that at some point too because as obsessive as we have to be, there needs to be something else \u2026 whether you find that something else in kids or otherwise, you gotta find it because this job will kill you.\u201d\n\nSchefter added, \u201cI relish those moments when the phone is not ringing and we\u2019re sitting around enjoying peaceful moments and I can get through a show or streaming without being interrupted.\u201d\n\nCharania explained that one way he\u2019s able to \u201cget away\u201d and unplug \u2014 to an extent \u2014 is by spending time with his family.\n\n\u201cMy whole family is in Chicago and I\u2019m in Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in very close proximity. It\u2019s the little things.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that he\u2019s \u201cnot fully present\u201d during family activities, such as pickleball and mini golf \u2014 and recalled lasting 10 minutes during a pickleball game before the start of NBA free agency.\n\n\u201cI was just literally pacing on the field for \u2026 50 or 60 minutes, because that\u2019s just what it is,\u201d Charania said. \u201c\u2026 My family is gracious enough where as long as I\u2019m in their presence, they don\u2019t make me feel bad and I think having those types of people around me allows me to keep going.\u201d\n\nCharania began working as an insider in his early college days.\n\nWhile his friends were partying and going out, Charania was attending various events and glued to his phone and computer.\n\nWhat was once a dream of playing in the NBA turned into a passion for reporting and hustling behind the scenes to break the biggest news stories around the league.\n\nDuring an interview with The Post in 2022, Charania explained that he wasn\u2019t interested in starting a family because his mind was consumed by work.\n\n\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI live such a crazy schedule. I\u2019m 24/7/365. It would definitely take the right person. I have colleagues at The Athletic and Stadium [his employer at the time] who have spouses and I don\u2019t get how they do it.\n\n\u201cI look at myself now, and I can\u2019t even imagine having a wife or child. I barely have time for myself! I\u2019m sure, one day, my priorities might change, but right now it\u2019s work, work, work, family, work, work. That\u2019s what consumes my mind.\u201d",

      "text": "Former Pistons guard and current free agent Malik Beasley was evicted from his Detroit apartment Wednesday amid alleged financial troubles and the FBI\u2019s investigation into purported gambling activity involving NBA games and prop bets, according to The Detroit News.\nThis eviction came following two lawsuits after Beasley, 28, failed to pay rent for his downtown high-rise apartment at The Stott, which is part of Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert\u2019s business ventures, per the report.\nThe landlord has sued Beasley twice this year after he did not pay a \u201ccollective\u201d $21,500 in rent, according to the paper.\nBeasley, 28, reportedly did not respond to the second lawsuit, which alleged he did not pay $7,355, leading to a default judgment being filed against the guard Wednesday.\nThe outlet further reported that the case is pending.\nThis development continues what has been a rough offseason for Beasley, who reportedly had been discussing a three-year, $42 million deal to return to the Pistons after a strong showing this past season before the revelation of the gambling probe in June.\nAt least one U.S. sportsbook noted \u201cunusual heavy betting interest\u201d regarding his statistics, with such wagers called prop bets, during the 2023-24 season when he played for the Bucks, according to ESPN.\n\u201cAn investigation is not a charge,\u201d Steve Haney, Beasley\u2019s attorney, said to ESPN in June. \u201cMalik is afforded the same right of the presumption of innocence as anyone else under the U.S. Constitution. As of now he has not been charged with anything.\u201d\nAs the investigation came to light, details emerged about his financial troubles.\nESPN reported how Beasley\u2019s former marketing agency sued him for failing to pay back a $650,000 advance, with the company alleging \u201cfinancial issues\u201d for the NBAer.\nThe Detroit News further revealed how Beasley accrued multiple debts to a barber, dentist, landlord and lender, and had been the subject of lawsuits.\nThat July report noted the pair of lawsuits against him filed by the Detroit apartment.\nBeasley recently broke his silence amid the scandals while responding to questions on Snapchat, indicating his desire to return to the NBA.\nWarning: Graphic language\n\u201cI feel like people turned they backs on me,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cLow key, people were saying some crazy things in the media. If you go on Instagram, you\u2019ll see the craziest s\u2013t. People judging you.\n\u201cHave I made mistakes in my life? Yes. Am I proud of those mistakes? No. I\u2019m human, but I know what I know. \u2026 Until something else is done, then I just gotta stay positive, stay low key. \u2026 I got a chip on my shoulder. I\u2019m ready to destroy anybody in front of me, I\u2019m ready to prove again that I belong in this league. For those who know me, I work too hard, I work every day. I put basketball before anything.\u201d\nBeasley signed a one-year, $6 million deal with the Pistons before the 2024-25 season and finished second in Sixth Man of the Year voting after averaging 16.3 points per game.\nThe gambling probe raises uncertainty about whether he will join a roster for this upcoming season."

      "text": "Asking reporters to name their biggest scoops is like asking a parent to pick a favorite child, but Shams Charania reckons the scoop of his that might have had the biggest \u201cmagnitude\u201d was Rudy Gobert testing positive for COVID-19 in March of 2020.\nCharania, an NBA insider for The Athletic and Stadium, spoke to The Post over lunch in Chicago last week about his career path and what he wants out of life with his own free agency approaching.\nGobert testing positive was a flashpoint not just in sports but in broader American society. It was such a surreal moment, given that he had dismissed the disease by mockingly touching microphones in the days prior to his contraction. One night, the NBA was staging games in full arenas. The next, like much of the country, it was shut down indefinitely, as we saw wild video of Thunder and Rockets players leaving the court minutes before they were set to tip off in Oklahoma City. There were rumors the Jazz might have to return to Salt Lake City by bus.\n\u201cWhen you break signings and trades and day-to-day NBA stuff, that\u2019s on you to get things right. This was one where there are legal boundaries. There\u2019s lawyers,\u201d Charania said. \u201cWe were at a point at that moment where stuff was starting to get canceled. It had just been declared a world pandemic. Tom Hanks announcing he tested positive right before Gobert was an \u2018oh s\u2013t\u2019 moment. I was sitting on the Rudy news for 90 minutes \u2014 an eternity in this world. The whole time I thought I was going to get beat.\u201d\nCharania is a looming free agent this summer. Currently, he contributes writing to The Athletic \u2014 the subscription site recently acquired by the New York Times \u2014 and social, TV and video content to the Sinclair-owned Stadium. When he gets a scoop, he tags both outlets for the credit.\nHe won\u2019t discuss the specifics of his current negotiations, but an intriguing element is whether he would collaborate with a sports gambling company for all or part of his work.\nThe marketing money that the sportsbooks have spent in hopes of customer acquisition has been enormous, and they\u2019ve sought to lure big-name talents away from established brands.\nVarious gambling companies tried to land Adrian Wojnarowski and Adam Schefter when their deals with ESPN were up, but the duo, both repped by CAA, opted to remain at the Mothership.\nSo far, the people who have tended to work most successfully in affiliate relationships with the sportsbooks are edgy personalities with big individual followings like Pat McAfee, Clay Travis and Barstool Sports talents such as Dave Portnoy, Dan Katz and PFT Commenter (Eric Sollenberger).\nThe league insiders have incredible social engagement from their legions of followers, but we haven\u2019t yet seen one of the elite-tier insiders of a primary league like the NFL, NBA or MLB try their hand at it. This is partly because the outlets and networks where they work have ponied up to get and keep them \u2014 they have tangible value in the hours they spend on-air, and intangible value in allowing places like ESPN and NFL Network to trumpet their scoops on their perpetual ticker \u2014 and partly because the rigors of the job and barriers to entry of source cultivation have made it so there aren\u2019t that many of them out there.\nWhether Charania could turn even a fraction of his nearly 2 million combined followers on Twitter and Instagram into regulars at a shop like FanDuel, DraftKings, PointsBet, BetMGM, BetRivers or Caesar\u2019s is an intriguing question, and he could be one of their last bites at the proverbial apple for quite some time.\nCharania wrote for RealGM from 2011 through 2015 while he was in college, trying to do whatever he could to get noticed.\n\u201cThe public is not going to notice you when you\u2019re breaking 10-day contracts and European signings,\u201d Charania said matter-of-factly. However, those nuggets doubled as building blocks as he compiled relationships that ultimately provided bigger scoops.\nHis coming-out moment, so to speak, was breaking the trade of Luol Deng from the Bulls to the Cavaliers in early 2014. Charania, now 28, was just 19 at the time.\n\u201cI think that was the moment where a lot of people were like \u2018Okay. This is kid is legit,'\u201d Charania said. \u201cSo, the door had opened, but it was like, \u2018what am I gonna make out of this? Am I going to be a one-and-done or am I going to do the work?'\u201d\nThe following year, Charania joined NBA scoop maestro Adrian Wojnarowski at The Vertical, the NBA site Wojnarowski had launched within Yahoo Sports.\nThe mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 have become rivals since Wojnarowski left Yahoo for ESPN in 2017.\nThe ongoing battle between the two for news breaks has occasionally taken on a surreal life of its own, with social media users keeping score and making memes of the reporters\u2019 trials and tribulations.\nThe public gravitates toward insiders like Schefter and Ian Rapoport, but doesn\u2019t have nearly as voracious an interest in tabulating who wins NFL or MLB scoops sweepstakes.\nAs far as what Charania will say directly about the relationship between himself and Woj, the answer is nothing \u2014 he politely declines to comment on the matter. Through an ESPN spokesperson, Wojnarowski also declined to comment for this story.\nWhile we can\u2019t know what either believes about the other in their heart of hearts, both of them clearly relish the competition. They work relentlessly at all hours of the day and night \u2014 and neither publicly acknowledges the other.\nEven if he won\u2019t discuss his rivals, Charania lives in perpetual fear of getting scooped.\nHe tries to play basketball, one of his scant hobbies, at times when he believes nothing might break.\nAsked about his screen time, Charania answered that the typical amount is 17-18 hours per day \u2014 and that it climbs over 20 hours during frenetic periods of the NBA Draft and free agency.\nIt makes his \u201cheart sink\u201d when he is on a flight where the Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t work. He mostly forgoes driving for ride-shares \u2014 his trips from the suburbs into Stadium\u2019s offices adjoining the United Center are about 40 minutes each way, a couple times a week \u2014 lest he miss a scoop while behind the wheel.\n\u201cI remember every story I\u2019ve gotten, and I definitely remember every story I haven\u2019t gotten,\u201d he said, in an aside when we were discussing his heart pounding in the process of obtaining the Gobert scoop.\nCharania has been grinding at this profession since his early college days. This has meant that at an age where many of his contemporaries are partying on the weekends, he was off to various events, or otherwise glued to his phone and computer.\nWhat made him choose that life?\nFirst, he\u2019s always been enamored with basketball and wanted to work around the sport. For years, his dream was to play, but he ultimately realized that was not an accomplishable goal.\n\u201cAs long as I could fulfill my passion, I was satisfied,\u201d Charania said of logging long reporting hours in college. \u201cIn the moment, why wait to live out your dream when you can live it out now? In my mind, writing at RealGM was \u2018I made it\u2019. Everything else was a cherry on top.\u201d\nHe did have occasional doubts, but they would dissipate quickly.\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying to you if I said [it\u2019s never crossed my mind],\u201d he said. \u201cThere are moments when I\u2019m lonely and I think about \u2018What if I was that everyday young adult, or had the partying college lifestyle? Because there are sacrifices that you make when your friends are going out on the weekend and you\u2019re driving to Milwaukee or Indianapolis for a game. That might be a thought on a late Saturday night, but then you have a conversation with someone [important], and you get reminded real fast that there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re doing it. I\u2019m passionate about the job I do and the people I work with, and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything.\u201d\nWhereas most of the prominent league insiders have a wife and kids \u2014 Wojnarowski, Schefter, Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Jeff Passan to name several \u2014 Charania is untethered from familial responsibilities. He has strong family bonds, living just minutes away from them in the Chicago suburbs, but says he is not giving any thought to forming one of his own.\n\u201cI\u2019m really close to my mother, brother and sister,\u201d he says. \u201cImmediately family means a lot.\u201d\nBut he\u2019s not pursuing a mate at this time.\n\u201cNot right now,\u201d he answers quickly. \u201cI live such a crazy schedule. I\u2019m 24/7/365. It would definitely take the right person. I have colleagues at The Athletic and Stadium who have spouses and I don\u2019t get how they do it. I look at myself now, and I can\u2019t even imagine having a wife or child. I barely have time for myself! I\u2019m sure, one day, my priorities might change, but right now it\u2019s work, work, work, family, work, work. That\u2019s what consumes my mind.\u201d\nReflecting on what has been a whirlwind decade-plus in the industry, Charania purports to have become more relaxed about the timeline of his trajectory and letting things happen more gradually.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency, and I deal with it even now, where you\u2019re kind of impatient,\u201d he said, speaking about himself in the second-person. \u201cYou want everything so fast. That\u2019s something I definitely grappled with in my early 20s. I wanted the world. I wanted to dominate at a very early point in my career. But then you hone in on your principles and understand it\u2019s a bigger picture thing, and you want relationships that are long-lasting, not just something that is a flash in the pan.\u201d\nHe claims not to have particular long-term goals beyond continual improvement at his already-existing tasks and audience metrics.\n\u201cI get asked the five-year goal question a lot, because you never know what can happen in a week,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to live a day-to-day life. When I was growing up, I thought it was the biggest cliche how players and coaches would say they take it one game at a time. But it\u2019s actually true.\n\u201cOverall, when I look at five years from now, I hope that I\u2019m more developed on-camera, dominating the space on-air. Overall, I want to do better articles, videos and shows. Our shows have gone from 100-200K views on digital shows to millions of viewers on Twitter live. Now I want to get to 2 or 3 million. I want to keep growing and rising. As long as I feel like I\u2019m meeting my standards.\u201d\nCharania did acknowledge that he would like to branch out into making content like documentaries or other long-form video content, but has not gotten there yet.\nHe also says that he is \u201cnot at all\u201d motivated by money: \u201cI didn\u2019t get into this for that. I got into this because I\u2019m passionate about the field \u2014 basketball, storytelling, sit-down interviews. I let [my agent] Maury [Gostfrand at The Montag Group] handle that.\u201d\nWhen he claims not to have forward-looking goals other than the athlete-cliche continual improvement, and not to have lofty financial motivations, it is a little bit hard to believe given the sacrifices he has made. For those assertions to be fully true, it would place him at odds with a vast majority of other highly ambitious, limelight-seeking reporters.\nNonetheless, the way Charania projects himself interpersonally makes you understand why he is talented at cultivating relationships among the powerful. He is confident and composed and does not come across as anxious or in a self-absorbed hurry. In a skill that is vitally important for reporters, he gives the impression of being an interested listener. He seeks advice, and compliments queries as \u201cgood question.\u201d\nBecause his content generally concerns empirical facts \u2014 a trade, a signing or details about something that has happened or is going to happen \u2014 he doesn\u2019t risk alienating sources with his personal opinions.\nCertainly there must have been times where he\u2019s reported on behind-the-scenes elements in NBA locker rooms and organizations where subjects have been irate about details coming to light. At first, he claimed that he has no specifics that immediately come to mind of it having happened. Pressed, he laughed and acknowledged that it has occurred, but declined to specify which players, coaches or executives have given him an earful.\nWith his own free agency looming, it will be interesting to see what shape Charania\u2019s work takes next, and where it is delivered."

      "text": "Anthony Richardson knocked out of first preseason game in Colts injury worry\nAnthony Richardson\u2019s 2025 preseason debut didn\u2019t last long.\nJust eight minutes into the first quarter of the Colts\u2019 loss to the Ravens on Thursday night, Richardson was leveled by an unblocked David Ojabo and was forced to leave the game.\nWhile the hit looked fairly vicious and was initially presumed as an arm injury, it was later designated as a dislocated pinky, and Richardson was ruled out for the remainder of the game.\nIndianapolis head coach Shane Steichen later said Richardson\u2019s pinky \u201cpopped out, popped back in.\u201d\nSteichen ruled Richardson as day-to-day.\n\u201cI feel like I was doing decent out there, besides that one play right there,\u201d Richardson said, according to NFL.com. \u201cBut everything happens for a reason. Still got next game, so I\u2019m not too worried about it.\u201d\nHe attempted just three passes and completed two of them for 21 yards before exiting.\nRichardson is freshly recovered from a shoulder injury setback that forced him to miss the final two weeks of the Colts\u2019 practices in June.\nThe signal-caller is in the midst of the quarterback duel with former Giant Daniel Jones, who took over for Richardson when he exited.\nJones played the rest of the first half and completed just 10 of 21 passes for 144 yards. Rookie Riley Leonard out of Notre Dame took over the quarterback reps in the second half.\nJones is in his first season with Indianapolis after signing a one-year, $14 million contract after spending six years with the Giants and a brief stint with the Vikings, while Richardson is in just his third year after being drafted by the Colts with the fourth overall pick in 2023.\nRichardson played just four games during his rookie campaign before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury. He helped lead the Colts to a 2-2 record while tallying seven total touchdowns and one interception.\nIn his sophomore season in 2024, he played in 11 games while missing contests because of two separate injuries and being benched for veteran Joe Flacco.\nRichardson threw just eight touchdowns to 12 interceptions when he did play, but added six rushing touchdowns."

      "text": "Eli Apple\u2019s San Francisco tenure proved to be a short one.\nThe 49ers signed Apple on July 28 following a tryout, but his stay lasted just two weeks after he was released Thursday.\nHis career started with high hopes on the Giants after he was drafted at No. 10 in 2016. He spent two and a half seasons in New York, totaling just one interception and 20 passes defended in 30 games.\nHe was traded halfway through the 2018 season to the Saints to end his lackluster Big Apple stint.\nIn 2021, Michael Renner of Pro Football Focus called Apple the worst first-round pick made by the franchise since 2006.\nAfter joining the Saints, Apple did see a slight uptick in his production, as he recorded two interceptions and 14 passes defended with New Orleans.\nApple said earlier this year that playing in the Big Easy was more agreeable.\n\u201cChaotic is what I knew from being in the media storm of New York. So when I got to New Orleans, the media wasn\u2019t as ruthless when I got out there. It was more calm for me,\u201d Apple said in a Q&A with ReadWrite\u2019s Kyle Odegard.\nApple added that he tried to do too much in New York.\n\u201cBeing a young guy coming in, you try to balance everything, and you try to play Superman,\u201d Apple said in the Q&A. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s tough \u2026 That was my mistake, trying to do too much.\u201d\nBut in 2019, he regressed, posting an interception-less season with New Orleans.\nAfter that, the only other successful campaign he had was with the Bengals in 2021, when the team reached the Super Bowl \u2014 with him starting the big game at corner after he recorded two picks in the regular season.\nNow, after getting cut by the 49ers, it remains to be seen where he\u2019ll end up next as he looks to continue his NFL career."
