It\u2019s been a four-year journey. It feels like it\u2019s time to graduate.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u2018Happy\u2019s Place\u2019 Co-Creator Teases Conflict Between Bobbie and Isabella in Season 2: \u2018This Is More the Marriage Phase\u2019\n\u2022 None \u2018Bel-Air\u2019 Boss Says Season 4 Is Both an Ending and a Beginning: \u2018Feels Like It\u2019s Time to Graduate\u2019\n\u2022 None \u2018Alien: Earth\u2019 Release Schedule: What Time Are the First 2 Episodes Out on Hulu?\n\u2022 None \u2018South Park\u2019: Kristi Noem Shoots Up a Pet Store Full of Dogs in Credits Scene Comedy Central Didn\u2019t Air | Video\n\nIt won\u2019t be just Will and Carlton who are \u201cgraduating to their next step,\u201d Banks-Waddles continued, noting that each characters\u2019 Season 4 storylines will introduce their next act. \u201cIt will feel like an ending, but it should also feel like a great beginning for what\u2019s next for everybody.\u201d\n\nOlly Sholotan, who plays Carlton Banks on \u201cBel-Air,\u201d noted that the final episodes are were handled with \u201cthe most care I\u2019ve seen, I think, any characters in television have.\u201d \u201cIt was just really beautiful, as a cast, for us to read the words that you wrote and how much care you took of every character\u2019s final moments on the show,\u201d Sholotan said to Banks-Waddles on the panel.\n\nSholotan and Jabari Banks, who stars as Will, also teased that as Will and Carlton transition from boys to young men as they graduate college, there might be some conflicts between the cousins.\n\n\u201cThey are really stepping into their own this season and showing up for each other in ways that they never have before and encouraging each other in ways they never have before, I think it\u2019s natural for our characters to butt heads,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI think they take care of each other in the most beautiful way possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd maybe Uncle Phil needs to step in here and there to help them out in all of the legal ways needed, maybe,\u201d Sholotan added.\n\nAs the cast and crew of \u201cBel-Air\u201d prepare to say goodbye to the Peacock series, Cassandra Freeman, who plays Vivian Banks, praised the show for offering what she said fans have applauded as an \u201caccurate depiction\u201d of \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to see my mother, my cousins, these successful women in the world,\u201d saying \u201cI\u2019m excited to see what develops from people being inspired by the show, what legacy comes from this \u2026 I pray that the legacy of this show is you see more people have full representation and expression.
