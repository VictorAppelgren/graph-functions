  "description": "Alexis Gosselin appeared on mom Kate Gosselin\u2019s TikTok, days after Collin Gosselin shared an emotional message about being 'forced apart' from siblings",
  "content": "Alexis Gosselin made a rare appearance on mom Kate Gosselin\u2019s TikTok page days after estranged brother Collin Gosselin spoke out about being \u201cforced apart\u201d from his siblings.\n\nAlexis, 21, briefly appeared in Kate\u2019s TikTok video on Saturday, August 9. The clip showed the TLC personality, 50, packing her lunch and dinner ahead of her shift as a nurse. At one point, Alexis walked into the kitchen and gave her mom a hug before heading out for the day.\n\n\u201cRide carefully, and text me when you get there, please,\u201d Kate called to her daughter, who replied, \u201cLove you.\u201d\n\nIn the comments section, fans marveled at how much Alexis has grown up while Kate shared more insight into her relationship with her kids.\n\n\u201cAwe Lex with the surprise appearance!\u201d one user wrote, while another person added, \u201cHow are you telling Lex to drive safely when she was just a baby 5 minutes ago?! \ud83d\ude2d Where does the time go?\u201d\n\nA third follower wrote, \u201cThe way you can see the natural connection and love between you and Lexi is adorable.\u201d\n\nKate replied, \u201cI don\u2019t see them much anymore. They come and go and I\u2019m just left behind hoping they\u2019ll stay longer \u2026\ud83d\ude29.\u201d\n\nKate shares Alexis and her sextuplet siblings \u2014 Collin, Hannah, Aaden, Leah and Joel \u2014 as well as twins Mady and Cara, 24, with ex-husband Jon Gosselin. The family rose to fame on their reality show Jon & Kate Plus 8, which aired on the Discovery Health Channel and later TLC from 2007 to 2017. (The series became known as Kate Plus 8 following her divorce from Jon, 48, in 2009.)\n\nAlexis\u2019 appearance on her mom\u2019s page came days after Collin shared a throwback photo of himself and his siblings as children via TikTok, as well as a current selfie. Along with the photos, he shared a message about their estrangement.\n\n\u201cBorn to be a team, us against the world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cForced to do it alone, and wonder every day what our lives could\u2019ve looked like.\u201d\n\nIn the caption, Collin added, \u201cForced apart, pitted against each other. All the fame and money in the world, but what about kids being kids? I will always love them more than anything. The tears I shed behind closed doors, thinking about the memories we could\u2019ve shared. I love you guys.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Jon was granted custody of Collin after he wrote a letter to his father from a mental health facility, claiming that Kate had institutionalized him to cover up alleged abuse. Hannah also chose to live with their father in their home state of Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Kate moved to North Carolina in 2021 with Alexis, Aaden, Leah, and Joel. Mady and Cara had already been attending separate colleges in New York at the time.\n\nKate denied Collin\u2019s abuse claims after he made similar accusations in a July 2023 Vice TV interview.\n\n\u201cMy son Collin, whom I love with all my heart, has received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years,\u201d she wrote via Instagram at the time. \u201cFor the safety of myself, his brothers and sisters and for his own well-being, he was placed in a facility following the years of outpatient treatment which proved insufficient for his needs. The decision to admit him was made by emergency room doctors following one of his many attacks/outbursts \u2013 this one involving his use of a weapon.\u201d\n\nCollin said he would be open to reconciling with his mother in an October 2024 interview with The U.S. Sun.\n\n\u201cSo, first and foremost, my relationship with my brothers and sisters is of top priority to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think the only way that my mother and I would be able to reconnect and fix our relationship in the future is, if she would just come forward with the truth and all the things that she has kept under wraps.\u201d",

      "text": "Brandon Blackstock\u2018s son Seth and ex-wife Melissa Ashworth Wells have spoken out about the talent manager\u2019s death.\n\u201cI lost my hero yesterday, words can\u2019t describe how proud of you I am on raising me and your 3 other kids,\u201d Seth, 18, wrote via Instagram on Saturday, August 9, alongside a series of throwback photos with his late dad. \u201cYou were a father, a son, a brother, and most importantly my best friend.\u201d\nSeth shared that while his father is no longer with him physically, his spirit will live on in other ways.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to watch me grow up from a Birds Eye view now but that\u2019s OK with me. There\u2019s no one else on this earth that I would want to be my dad because no one can be half the man you were to me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll see you everyday when the sun rises and falls. I can confidently say all the deer and elk took a sigh of relief when the best hunter I\u2019ve ever known laid his rifle down for the last time.\u201d\n\u201cI love you so much and can\u2019t wait to throw a line in the water with you again. Love you dad. Be good or good at it -love your son Seth,\u201d he concluded.\nBrandon welcomed Seth with Ashworth Wells in 2007. The exes, who were married from 1999 to 2012, also shared daughter Savannah, 23. Savannah, for her part, shares son Lake with husband Quentin Lee. Following his split from Ashworth Wells, Brandon moved on with Kelly Clarkson. The pair tied the knot in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. Clarkson filed for divorce in 2020 after seven years of marriage.\nOne day before Seth\u2019s tribute, Ashworth Wells shared an emotional post dedicated to Brandon.\n\u201cBrandon was full of charm, wit, and just an absolute gentleman who happened to wear cowboy boots, wrangler jeans, and a cowboy hat. He was by far, hands down, the best Daddy and Pa. He loved hard and he fought hard,\u201d she wrote via Instagram on Friday, August 8. \u201cThe best thing Brandon has left for his children is they know where he is. I\u2019ve heard it said, \u2018Nothing is lost when you know where it is\u2019 and Brandon is with Jesus his Savior. Savannah, Seth, and our grandchildren are the best parts of who Brandon and I are. Thank you all for your prayers and condolences. \u271d\ufe0f.\u201d\nBrandon died on August 7 following a private battle with cancer.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us Weekly in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nBrandon\u2019s cause of death was due to melanoma, which is a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes."

      "text": "Fans must wait until 2026 for an all-new season of The Rookie \u2014 but Us Weekly already knows which cast members are, and aren\u2019t, returning.\nShowrunner Alexi Hawley exclusively confirmed to Us in May that season 8 of the ABC series will feature both Oscar Hutchinson (Matthew Glave) and Monica Stevens (Bridget Regan) as villains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the last we\u2019re gonna see [of] him,\u201d Hawley said of Oscar, who was able to escape police capture during the season 7 finale, but not with the stolen diamonds he acquired. \u201cI think we\u2019re heading for \u2026 a bit of an end game there, or at least the end of a chapter.\u201d\nWhen it comes to Monica, Hawley told fans at San Diego Comic-Con in July that season 8 will begin overseas in Prague with the corrupt attorney \u2014 who made a deal with the FBI to close season 7 \u2014 front and center.\nOfficer John Nolan (Nathan Fillion) is confirmed to be making the trip alongside Detective Nyla Harper (Mekia Cox) and The Rookie: Feds\u2019 FBI Supervisory Special Agent Matt Garza (Felix Solis), according to TVLine. But who else from the police force \u2014 and their inner circle \u2014 can fans expect to see next season?\nScroll down for everything we know about The Rookie\u2019s season 8 cast:\nNathan Fillion\nFillion confirmed his return as officer John Nolan in April, while celebrating the season 8 renewal announcement.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough to know how truly challenging and rare it is to have a long running show. Thank you all for sticking around for these 7 seasons \u2014 it\u2019s because of you that we are announcing season 8!!\u201d the actor wrote via Instagram. \u201cCongratulations to @alexihawley and the wonderful team that puts this show together. I am so very proud to work alongside all of you. Let\u2019s do this! #therookie.\u201d\nAlyssa Diaz\nDiaz\u2019s Detective Angela Lopez is safe from the chopping block heading into season 8. She will be part of the LAPD force working to bring down Monica and Oscar \u2014 when he eventually resurfaces.\nEric Winter\nWinter will be back as Tim Bradford, who fans last saw asked Lucy Chen (Melissa O\u2019Neil) to move in with him, but she dozed off and didn\u2019t hear him.\n\u201cI do think that cementing that conversation [between them] at the top of the next season and figuring out what the next [or] the right next step is, that\u2019s gotta be our premiere, right?\u201d Hawley told Us in May, noting that the writers will \u201cfigure it out from there\u201d how Tim and Lucy proceed as a couple.\nWinter, meanwhile, confessed to TVLine in May that he\u2019s unsure how Tim will proceed after putting his heart on the line. \u201cI\u2019m actually very curious about that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has to do a lot of damage control.\u201d\nMelissa O\u2019Neil\nO\u2019Neil will reprise her role as Lucy Chen, but the new sergeant won\u2019t be on the night shift much longer. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an obstacle,\u201d Hawley teased. \u201cThe challenge of the night shift was fun in the finale but ultimately, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna live in there for too long.\u201d\nThe executive producer also told fans at San Diego Comic Con in July that Lucy will dive deeper into police work this season. \u201cWe have an undercover Lucy story that we\u2019re working on in the writers\u2019 room right now,\u201d he said via People.\nMekia Cox\nCox will return as Nolan\u2019s former training officer, detective Nyla Harper this season. While her story line has not been shared, Hawley told Us in May that fans will see more of Nyla and her husband, James Murray (Arjay Smith), after their rocky season 7.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been through the fire a bit for sure,\u201d the showrunner said. \u201cThe inherent contradiction of his job and her job is still there. I do think that they\u2019ve navigated it for now. They\u2019re definitely in a stronger place than they were say early in season 7.\u201d\nRichard T. Jones\nJones is returning as Lieutenant Wade Grey and his wife, Luna (Angela Parker), is expected to appear in several episodes as the couple is still going strong.\nWhen it comes to what Jones wants to see for Grey during season 8, he exclusively told Us in March that a cookoff between the lieutenant and rookie Miles Penn (Deric Augustine) would be fun. \u201cI think that\u2019d be just a great close out of an episode that, you know, everybody\u2019s at a barbecue. That we\u2019re having a competition. And they\u2019ll be the judges,\u201d he proposed.\nJenna Dewan\nHawley confirmed during San Diego Comic-Con in July that Nolan\u2019s wife, Bailey Nune, played by Dewan, flew to Prague for the season 8 premiere alongside her TV husband. As in seasons\u2019 past, she will continue to be part of the cast and remain Nolan\u2019s No. 1 lady.\nShawn Ashmore\nAshmore will reprise his role as attorney Wesley Evers, but Hawley told Us that his and Angela\u2019s marriage won\u2019t be tested amid Monica\u2019s return. (Corrupt attorney Monica dated Wesley prior to his relationship with the detective.)\n\u201cAt this point Monica\u2019s got such bad blood with so many of our characters that I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d be shaking stuff up with Wesley and Angela,\u201d Hawley said in the spring.\nThe showrunner also told TVLine in April that Wesley\u2019s arc might include running for DA after his boss bowed out of the race. \u201cWe\u2019re sniffing around a bit of where to take that story, and it would certainly make sense for Wesley, who was a defense attorney and believes very strongly in righting the wrongs of an unjust justice system,\u201d Hawley mused. \u201cHe\u2019s an assistant DA, they have not a ton of power, so becoming the DA would give him an ability to shake things up. So, we\u2019re definitely kicking the tires on that idea.\u201d\nLisseth Chavez\nChavez has been playing Celina Juarez since season 5, completing her rookie training during season 7. She is set to return for season 8 \u2014 and her romance with Rodge Bronson (Zander Hawley) could continue, according to Hawley.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re both young, and so I don\u2019t know that we need to define everything [and it] doesn\u2019t have to turn into a relationship,\u201d Hawley explained to Us in May of Celina and Rodge\u2019s story line. \u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent sure where it goes, but I do think that ultimately we are very aware that we have some very strong relationships on the show.\u201d\nDeric Augustine\nAugustine joined the cast during season 7 as rookie officer Miles Penn. For season 8, the actor has been promoted to series regular, TVLine confirmed in July.\nShowrunner Hawley previously told Us that Miles\u2019 \u201crookie year is not over,\u201d so the writers are \u201cgoing to live in his rookie year for a while.\u201d He teased, \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of places to push. I mean, he is still trying to find out who he is in Los Angeles. He tried to start dating and that went very badly in the finale. He\u2019s living in his car. That\u2019s obviously, you know, an obstacle for him as well to overcome. I\u2019m excited to see where it goes.\u201d\nPatrick Keleher\nKeleher played the controversial rookie Seth Ridley, who lied about his past and his cancer diagnosis before being cut from the LAPD Mid-Wilshire department. He returned later during season 7 after claiming that his cancer diagnosis was an insurance scam and was once again part of the training program. Seth got shot during season 7, episode 16, in the line of duty and needed his leg amputated.\nWhile fans thought it was the last they\u2019d see of Seth, Hawley told TVLine that might not be the case. \u201cSomething shocking deserved to happen\u201d to that character, the showrunner said in July, teasing, \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll see where it goes.\u201d"

      "text": "The official cause of death for Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has been confirmed.\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis told Us Weekly on Monday, August 11, that Blackstock\u2019s cause of death was melanoma, a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement.\nBlackstock died on August 7 after privately battling cancer for three years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, Clarkson, 43, alerted fans to Blackstock\u2019s illness when she put her Las Vegas residency on pause, though she didn\u2019t reveal the nature of his condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she announced via Instagram on August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."

The little ones joined twins Madelyn and Cara, who arrived four years earlier.\nThe reality stars, who tied the knot in 1999, called it quits a decade after their nuptials. While the former couple were granted shared physical custody of their kids, Kate received legal custody of all eight children. (Per The Center for Family Law, legal custody \u201crefers to the rights and the obligation to make decisions about a child,\u201d while physical custody \u201crefers to which parent the child is physically with at any given time.\u201d)\nIn 2016, she revealed that she had sent Collin to Fairmont Behavioral Health Institute for behavioral issues. (Jon later told the Daily Mail: \u201cOther than ADHD, which is extremely common, Collin has never been diagnosed with any known medical condition.\u201d) In 2018, Jon had the teenager removed from the facility.

The pair engaged in a subsequent affair, which led to the band breaking up and Joel battling a severe depression that included two suicide attempts. (The affair and its aftermath were discussed in the two-part HBO documentary Billy Joel: And So It Goes, which premiered in July.)\nThe pair later reconnected after Weber\u2019s divorce and married in 1973, going on to spend nearly 10 years together before ending their marriage in 1982. Joel went on to marry Christie Brinkley in 1985, welcoming daughter Alexa Ray Joel before calling it quits in 1994. Joel then married cookbook author Katie Lee in 2004 \u2014 the pair divorced five years later in 2009. In 2015, Joel married Alex Roderick.

But it\u2019s all good. \u201c\nWeber said that her son Sean and Joel \u201cwere very close,\u201d adding that during their marriage the three \u201clived on top of the mountain.\u201d\n\u201cWe entertained each other,\u201d she explained. \u201cBill and I worked all day long and the whole writing process was never done \u2014 in the years that Bill and I were together \u2014 was never done remotely or in [a] studio.

She had a room put up with cameras in it, a tiny window in the corner and it was bolt-locked from the outside,\u201d Collin alleged in a bombshell interview released by The U.S. Sun on Tuesday, September 10. \u201cIt was like a containment room, literally, and it had a mattress on the floor and that\u2019s how I lived.\u201d\nCollin claimed that he \u201cwas 100 percent treated differently\u201d than his siblings.\nKate, 49, shares 23-year-old twins Mady and Cara, 23, and 20-year-old sextuplets Collin, Hannah, Leah, Joel, Alexis and Aaden, with ex-husband Jon Gosselin. The former couple rose to fame with their children on the reality show Jon & Kate Plus 8, which aired from 2007 to 2017.\n\u201cIt was rough. I definitely went through it a lot as a kid from my mother\u2019s end. So, it was tough,\u201d Collin told The Sun. \u201cI just remember being isolated from my siblings and constantly taking the fall for her emotions or the tough things going on in her life.\u201d\nCollin said he felt like \u201ca scapegoat\u201d within the family. \u201cI was isolated and I was taken away from them and I didn\u2019t eat dinners with my family,\u201d he alleged. (Us Weekly has reached out for comment.)\nThe alleged \u201ccontainment\u201d started when Collin was about 8 or 9 years old, he claimed.\n\u201cI was there, you know, most of the day because I didn\u2019t go to school after a certain point,\u201d he alleged. \u201cSo, most of the day I was in that room, and I was away from my siblings, and I never really went outside.\u201d\nCollin claimed that he was put in the isolation room \u201cmultiple times\u201d and Kate had \u201czip-tied my hands and feet together and bolt locked the door, turned the lights off and had cameras there just watching me.\u201d\nJon, 47, told The Sun that the room where Kate allegedly held Collin is \u201cstill\u201d in the house.\n\u201cMy friends\u2019 in-laws bought our house and one time they asked me, \u2018Why is there a room in the basement with a bed and a lock on the outside?\u2019 It must have been terrifying for him,\u201d Jon said, alleging that the apparent abuse occurred after their split.\nKate and Jon got divorced in 2009 after 10 years of marriage. At the time, she received primary custody of all eight kids and Collin spent several years in a health institution. In 2022, Hannah and Collin decided to live with Jon full-time.\nKate has not publicly responded to the abuse claims. However, her lawyer Richard Puleo told The Sun that he didn\u2019t believe she would do anything to \u201cintentionally harm\u201d Collin, who allegedly showcased \u201ctroubled behavior\u201d as a child.\n\u201cShe did what she did to protect herself and her family,\u201d he added.\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing child abuse, call or text Child Help Hotline at 1-800-422-4453."

      "text": "Machine Gun Kelly publicly addressed rumors of a romance with Sydney Sweeney.\nDuring an appearance on the Sunday, August 10, episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, MGK, whose real name is Colson Baker, was asked point-blank about his relationship with Sweeney, 27.\nAndy Cohen read from a question card that contained a viewer query from \u201cKyle P.\u201d The TV host said, \u201cMGK, Kyle P wants to know if there\u2019s any truth to the rumor that you and Sydney Sweeney were more than just friends.\u201d\nMGK, 35, responded while shaking his head and looking directly down the camera barrel, \u201cKyle P, shut up, dude,\u201d at which Cohen and the audience laughed loudly.\nIn May, photos published by Page Six showed the musician and Sweeney hugging at a Las Vegas club opening. Later that month, MGK shared an Instagram carousel that included a snap of himself posing alongside Sweeney as they flashed peace signs at the camera. (Patrick Schwarzenegger and Hollywood hair stylist Glen Oropeza were also in the snap.)\nAn Instagram Story shared by Sweeney at the time, published by the outlet, also featured a photo of herself posing with Schwarzenegger, 31, and MGK at the Vegas event.\nBoth MGK and Sweeney are currently single after the musician\u2019s split from Megan Fox was confirmed by Us Weekly in December 2024, and Sweeney\u2019s engagement to Jonathan Davino was called off in May. (MGK shares a daughter, Saga, 4 months, with Fox, 39, in addition to daughter Casie, 16, whom he shares with ex Emma Cannon.)\nMGK and Sweeney have been friends for years, with Sweeney starring in MGK\u2019s 2021 directorial debut, Downfalls High. The pair also appeared in the 2019 film Big Time Adolescence alongside MGK\u2019s close friend Pete Davidson.\nMGK\u2019s appearance on WWHL also saw an audience member ask him who his dream musical collaboration would be, living or dead, to which he responded, \u201c I like Frank, man, Frank Sinatra. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d\nHe was also asked by Cohen about how age, which garnered an interesting response from MGK: \u201cIt\u2019s a weird thing, dude, I don\u2019t know if it exists.\u201d\nCohen likened MGK\u2019s \u201cconnection to\u201d his age to that of Mariah Carey, who told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in July that she doesn\u2019t \u201callow\u201d herself to age, which drew MGK to say, \u201cI just don\u2019t know many facts about my life, so I\u2019m starting to just be like, like, my skin, if it just rips open, it heals really quick, there\u2019s just things where I\u2019m starting to be, like, who\u2019s my dad, you know?\u201d\nHinting that he may have otherworldly origins, MGK noted that he once asked his mother if there was any \u201cperiod of time where you went missing,\u201d which provided an unusual answer.\n\u201cShe told me she got abducted at one point so I was just, like,\u201d MGK said with a shrug."

And I think the only way that my mother and I would be able to reconnect and fix our relationship in the future is, if she would just come forward with the truth and all the things that she has kept under wraps.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAnd you know the many times that she\u2019s tried to soil my name and my father\u2019s name. I just would want her to come forward with the truth. [But] yes, that door would be open, 100 percent.\u201d\nJon was granted custody of Collin in 2018 after the young boy wrote a letter to his father from a mental health facility. At the time, Collin said Kate institutionalized him to cover up an alleged abuse. \u201cI was starting to tell people what was going on at home, and she caught wind of that and had to put me somewhere where I wouldn\u2019t be able to get the secrets out,\u201d he claimed.\nCollin also told The U.S. Sun Kate forced him to live in a closet. \u201cMy mother had a room built in our unfinished section of the storage basement. She had a room put up with cameras in it, a tiny window in the corner and it was bolt-locked from the outside,\u201d he told the outlet.\u201cIt was like a containment room, literally, and it had a mattress on the floor and that\u2019s how I lived.\u201d\nHe further insisted his mother \u201czip-tied my hands and feet together and bolt locked the door, turned the lights off and had cameras there just watching me.\u201d\nKate denied the allegations in July 2023. She told People at the time Collin \u201creceived multiple psychiatric diagnoses\u201d and had \u201cmany attacks/outbursts.\u201d\n\u201cAll measures that were taken in our home were at the explicit recommendation of his pediatric psychiatrist and/or his team of specialists and were put into place to safeguard every member of our family, our friends as well as our family pets. \u2026 Collin remains a very troubled young man who continues to need a lot of help,\u201d she added."

      "text": "Collin Gosselin issued an emotional message about his fractured relationship with his siblings amid his family\u2019s estrangement.\nKate and Jon Gosselin\u2018s son Collin, 21, recently took to TikTok with a message for his seven siblings. He shared a photo of himself and his brothers and sisters as kids \u2014 with twins Mady and Cara, now 24, and his fellow sextuplets, Alexis, Hannah, Aaden, Leah and Joel, also 21, featured in the post.\n\u201cBorn to be a team, us against the world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cForced to do it alone, and wonder every day what our lives could\u2019ve looked like.\u201d\nCollin reflected on how being in the spotlight affected his connection with his family, adding, \u201cForced apart, pitted against each other. All the fame and money in the world, but what about kids being kids?\u201d\nHe concluded: \u201cI will always love them more than anything. The tears I shed behind closed doors, thinking about the memories we could\u2019ve shared. I love you guys.\u201d\nIn 2007, Collin and his family rose to stardom with the premiere of Jon & Kate Plus 8, which ran for 11 seasons. (Kate, 50, and Jon, 48, welcomed twins Madelyn and Cara in 2000. Four years later, the sextuplets were born.)\nAfter a decade of marriage, Kate and Jon called it quits in 2009 and began battling for custody of their children. Jon was the primary guardian for Hannah and Collin until they turned 18 but has been estranged from his other children for several years.\nCollin, for his part, recently accused his mother of being \u201cphysically aggressive\u201d and \u201cverbally\u201d abusive when he was a child.\n\u201cIt was rough. I definitely went through it a lot as a kid from my mother\u2019s end. So, it was tough,\u201d Collin alleged during an interview with The U.S. Sun in October 2024. \u201cI just remember being isolated from my siblings and constantly taking the fall for her emotions or the tough things going on in her life.\u201d\nCollin claimed the abuse started when he was around 8 years old and included him being put in an isolation room \u201cmultiple times.\u201d Kate then allegedly \u201czip-tied my hands and feet together and bolt locked the door, turned the lights off and had cameras there just watching me.\u201d\n\u201cI was isolated and I was taken away from them and I didn\u2019t eat dinners with my family,\u201d he claimed. \u201cI was there, you know, most of the day because I didn\u2019t go to school after a certain point. So, most of the day I was in that room, and I was away from my siblings, and I never really went outside.\u201d\nJon supported Collin\u2019s account, telling the outlet, \u201cMy friends\u2019 in-laws bought our house and one time they asked me \u2018Why is there a room in the basement with a bed and a lock on the outside?\u2019 It must have been terrifying for him.\u201d\nKate\u2019s attorney Richard Puleo defended her in a statement but declined to comment on Collin\u2019s claims.\n\u201cShe never wants to comment because she always knows that this gets taken out of context,\u201d Puleo told Fox News at the time. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to comment. Doesn\u2019t need to. The record speaks for itself.\u201d\nAlong with his public plea on social media, Collin answered questions about what his relationship looks like with his siblings now.\n\u201cI just saw [Hannah] today!\u201d he wrote in the comments section. \u201cShe was worried her car wouldn\u2019t pass inspection so I was looking at it for her. She\u2019s so funny and I love her [so much]. It makes my day whenever I see her, but we\u2019re both so busy with work, school etc.\u201d\nCollin subsequently made it clear he hadn\u2019t fixed his issues with Kate.\n\u201cBeing locked up, isolated, zip tied. Being sent away because I didn\u2019t fit into an equation,\u201d he claimed in a separate comment. \u201cHaving one visit from her after being completely cut off with no contact at 12 years old, in which the whole visit was her telling me how I deserved the situation I was in because I \u2018destroyed our family.\u2019 Yeah I\u2019m sorry, but I will never \u2018understand\u2019 that. I will break the cycle that she couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nIn response to a question about his plans to have a family in the future, Collin added, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have kids and teach them the importance of siblings. I tell all my friends who have siblings to always value their siblings and hold each other close.\u201d"
