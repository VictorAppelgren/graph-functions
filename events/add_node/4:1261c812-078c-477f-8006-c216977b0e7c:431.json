    "importance_classification_rationale": "The Power of Siberia 2 pipeline represents a significant supply‑chain shift for natural gas, directly affecting the NatGas handle with a likely negative price impact in Europe and a positive impact in China. The announcement provides a clear catalyst window (immediate announcement to mid‑2025 construction start) and offers actionable signals for traders in energy, equity (energy companies), and FX (China‑Russia trade flows). While not an intraday shock, the pipeline’s 30‑year contract and 50 bcm/y capacity will influence NatGas pricing and related equity indices over the next 6–12 months, warranting a high‑centrality, short‑to‑medium‑term importance rating of 2.",
