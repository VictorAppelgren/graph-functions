A: Marcus Price, CEO: The restructuring was a one-off effect due to a client restructure in the second half of 2024. The underlying wealth business has grown in terms of its footprint, and we do not foresee any further restructuring. The business has now stabilized, and we expect growth from this new baseline.",
