  "title": "Khan Academy Review: The Best Free Online Learning Tool",
  "description": "The stellar Khan Academy offers free, well-structured online courses in a variety of subjects that you'll find in US schools, and serves as a reliable source for anyone with a hunger to learn.",
  "content": "Where should you go online to advance your understanding of a topic or study something new? For academic subjects, start with the excellent Khan Academy. It's one of the best online learning services, particularly for math, science, social studies, and language arts. Its many lessons contain videos, readings, and interactive exercises, which are sequenced so that you can start from square one with any subject. On top of that, it's completely free! For its combination of deep learning and no-cost entry, Khan Academy is a five-star Editors' Choice winner for free online learning tools.\n\nAs mentioned, Khan Academy and the organization that runs it are 501(c)(3) nonprofits. Their mission is \"to provide a free, world\u2011class education for anyone, anywhere.\" Therefore, Khan Academy is totally free. You don't even need to make an account and sign in to access the lessons. If you do make an account and sign in, you can keep track of your progress in various courses and access other features. One of these extra features is to give a teacher, tutor, or parent access to your learning history and let them assign challenges or assignments to you.\n\nKhan Academy's well-designed courses cater to students in the American education system. Many of its courses follow the formal curriculum assigned to the different grade levels. In addition to math, economics, and finance, Khan Academy covers science and engineering, computing, arts and humanities, test prep, college prep, career prep, and English language arts. Most of these topics have specific courses within them. For example, you can enroll in Precalculus, US history, and an LSAT prep course. There's no limit on the number of courses you can take, which is a nice touch. A mobile app, Khan Academy Kids, offers materials for young learners ages two to seven. There's an iPhone app, an iPad app, and an Android app (there are apps for the regular Khan Academy, too). Students in primary school can check out courses in English language arts and math that align with their education years, such as Second Grade Math. Another example is AP courses. AP, or Advanced Placement, is a program in the US in which students can take courses in high school, if they qualify, that count toward their undergraduate degree. In other words, students can take a university course before paying for university, and if they pass a standardized exam at the end, they get college credit. Khan Academy's AP courses prepare students in a particular subject matter, but the students must take the formal test wherever it's given; they cannot take the test or receive the final credit via Khan. Coursera, meanwhile, enrolls you in college courses from Yale and other prestigious universities for free. Thankfully, Khan Academy still offers insightful courses on learning how to code. These include introductory lessons on computer programming topics like CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and video game development. The lessons also include helpful videos and built-in tools for practicing your coding within the site itself.

Although there's no live phone chat, Khan Academy's support page offers resources for learners and parents, along with helpful tips and tricks taken straight from the community. However, Khan Academy's coding content is relatively limited compared with dedicated coding courses. If you want to take your education beyond intro classes, consider Codecademy and Treehouse, our Editors' Choice winners for free and paid coding courses, respectively.\n\nKhan Academy is built around video lectures, short readings, interactive quizzes (usually multiple choice), and comment threads. When you enroll in a course, you get access to all the video lectures and other materials that are in that course, and they're presented in a sequential order. Typically, a course contains units, which contain lessons, and within the lessons are videos, readings, and quizzes. In many cases, the sequence of lessons and units matters because you need to acquire foundational skills before you can advance your knowledge. Math courses are a good example. If you already have a particular skill, however, you're free to skip ahead. In some courses, it might make sense to jump into the material you want to learn or review, rather than plow through each and every lesson in order. For example, if you already have a strong understanding of the First Amendment to the US Constitution, you might skip ahead to the second. Some educators might dispute whether the term \"course\" is misleading in Khan Academy. It's a term used by both accredited institutions and more casual places of learning. The courses in Khan Academy refer to a group of learning materials. Some of the courses may have instructors who reply to comments, but you don't get an assigned instructor who offers personalized attention. Likewise, you don't have formal classmates or a timeline in which you need to work through the material. Khan is entirely self-paced. In the case of AP courses or even test prep, Khan acts more like a book on the subject than an individualized class. You can use Khan Academy in the same way that you might use an SAT prep book to learn strategies for passing the exam and see examples of questions. The big difference is that Khan Academy is free and interactive.\n\nThe experience of following Khan Academy's lectures and lessons varies based on the subject matter and who presents it. Founder Sal Khan hosts some of the videos because they were the initial inspiration for creating the site. Those videos set the tone and style overall. A good example of Khan's style can be found in the lessons on retirement accounts in the personal finance course. The videos there use a virtual blackboard where Khan writes a few notes while he talks. You listen to him explain, for example, the difference between a traditional IRA account and a Roth IRA. When he gets into the particulars and starts to make an example about how much money each account will contain, he writes down the figures: the principal investments, how much interest they earn, how much someone would pay in taxes on those accounts (and when), plus whatever fees they would incur for early withdrawals. It's very similar to having a teacher and a blackboard, only you don't see the teacher. The tone is friendly and clear. Khan often repeats what he's just said as he writes it down. For some learners, this style may come off as tedious. Others may see it as an advantage because the learner gets a moment to pause and synthesize the information. Other materials in the personal finance course were not created by Sal Khan but by contributions from other parties. For example, Better Money Habits supplies text and two short videos. The videos have a more commercial feel than Sal Khan's, but the content is non-promotional and helpful. Given Sal Khan's previous background as a financial analyst, he's a great resource for information on the economy and math. When it comes to subjects in the humanities, however, Khan Academy typically relies on other experts. There's an art history lesson about Islamic arts made by The British Museum, for example, another by TED Ed, and one by UNESCO. Some videos were produced by Khan Academy with the help of experts in the field who were brought in to develop content.",

      "text": "How I Used Lies About A Cartoon to Prove History Is Meaningless on the Internet\nBy Jordan Minor\nOf all the great and terrible things about the Internet, its ability to shape and rewrite reality might be the most dystopian. History is written by the victors, and every day it looks like the losers are humanity and meaning. A decade ago, I wrote some fan fiction that continues to distort the truth about a knock-off Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon series. Everything you think you know about Street Sharks is a lie.\nWell, that depends on what you think you know about Street Sharks. Before I reveal the lie, here\u2019s the truth: Street Sharks was a cartoon in the mid-1990s about four brothers who mutated into grotesque, radical shark men after getting \u201cgene-slammed.\u201d An obvious attempt to cash in on all things Turtlemania, the Street Sharks battled evil scientists and hapless animal-human hybrid henchmen while saying how much they hated pizza. Their catchphrase was \u201cJawsome!\u201d Much like its companion show Extreme Dinosaurs, Street Sharks is fondly remembered as a kitschy piece of 1990s pop culture trash.\nHere\u2019s how I turned Street Sharks into an ongoing online social experiment.\nIn 2003, when I was in middle school, I stumbled across the website TVTome.com. It was a user-edited wiki for TV shows. To be an editor for the big, popular shows, you had to prove you were qualified. After all, creating the official record of what happened on The Big Bang Theory was an important responsibility. But for some forgotten garbage show like Street Sharks , the screening process was nonexistent. Sensing an opportunity for nonsense, I became the Street Sharks editor and filled its page with lies. I made up characters, voice actors, episodes, plot descriptions, everything.\nHere\u2019s a description of \u201cShark to the Future,\u201d one the 40 real episodes of Street Sharks:\n\u201cThe Street Sharks are sent to a future where Dr. Piranoid controls everything. They meet up with Bends\u2019 great-great-grandson Bendsini and join the rebel forces.\u201d\nNow, here are three summaries for my 26-episode (plus one TV movie) alternate-universe Street Sharks. Tell me these descriptions for a cheap kids show designed to sell toys don\u2019t sound at least somewhat suspicious.\nSeason 2, Episode 8: \u201cMakeover\u201d\nStrong yet sensitive Big Slammu was always the most angered by his transformation. But when he accidentally frightens a little girl into a coma, he runs off to find a cure. His frantic journey eventually leads him to Dr. Paradigm. He is brainwashed and sent to destroy the sharks. Can our heroes defeat their friend and hope to reverse the effects before it\u2019s too late?\nOr how about this?\nSeason 2, Episode 1: \u201cCity at War (Part 1)\u201d\nThe sharks are back for a brand new fight! In this season premiere it\u2019s one year later after the last confrontation with Dr. Paradigm and the sharks have become a household name throughout Fission City. With their stranglehold on the city weakening, the various gangs are thrown into a violent war with each other and at the center of the madness is a nasty thug named Meathook with plans to use the war to take over the city. Now only the sharks can stop him.\nOr this beloved classic?\nSeason 1, Episode 6: \u201cThe Hot Chick\u201d\nStreex\u2019s sister Roxie has been wondering where her brother has been lately. Soon she stumbles upon the Shark Cave and learns her missing brother is the leader of a band of mutant sharks. Just then Slobster stops in and Roxie is severely injured. They\u2019ll have to give her the shark treatment to save her.\nIf and when Michael Bay or whoever reboots Street Sharks, I hope they use these episodes as a starting point. It was a fun creative-writing exercise, trolling as antagonistic fan fiction. I\u2019d even say some of my episodes had more compelling story arcs than the genuine article. At least all of my titles weren\u2019t shark puns.\nFor a while, all these falsehoods just sat there, not bothering anybody. But eventually, TVTome was bought and integrated into the much bigger CBS Interactive website TV.com. Thanks to that expanded platform, all of my lies rapidly began infecting the rest of the Internet. Most sites have purged themselves of my misinformation, but for years, IMDB, Amazon, and numerous smaller sites were unintentionally hosting my creative writing. If you\u2019re paranoid and trying to spot a fake, pretty much any episode with a specific 1994 air date and episode description is a fraud. If a shady website claims it has streaming videos of \u201cFeelin\u2019 Lobstery\u201d or \u201cGoin\u2019 Clammando\u201d \u2014 and a lot still do, since I still found these descriptions \u2014 it\u2019s lying to you even more than usual. The only place that\u2019s still entirely accurate is Wikipedia, hilariously enough.\nAnother telltale sign the info you\u2019re reading isn\u2019t true is the character Roxie, a female Street Shark I made up loosely based on real character Rox. People on forums continue to be confused about why they can\u2019t find anything about her or anything else from this mythic \u201calternate\u201d Street Sharks series. (They must seriously be feeling the Mandela Effect.) Some suspected that something was wrong, but couldn\u2019t quite figure out what or how or why. After all, what kind of person would intentionally sow lies about Street Sharks across the internet? I still love reading utterly baffled questions on Wikipedia talk pages, IMDB message boards, Facebook groups, and random YouTube comments from desperate people trying to track down \u201cthe one with the girl Street Shark.\u201d\nThe fake character with the most star power and closest to my heart is Meathook, allegedly played by Henry \u201cFonzie\u201d Winkler as a meta \u201cjump the shark\u201d reference. Search \u201cStreet Sharks cast\u201d on Google, and he\u2019s still listed in the cast. Winkler\u2019s IMDB page once said he was in the show. Netflix, while hosting the actual episodes for people to watch, put him in the cast list alongside Adam West, who was the fictional voice of a real character.\nThose are just the most prominent lies. No one has bothered to correct poor Khary Payton\u2019s IMDB page, since him voicing Moby Lick sounds so plausible, even though it didn\u2019t happen. Imagine Casting is a website where people fan-cast movies based on properties they like, and someone there suggested Famke \u201cJean Grey\u201d Janssen as Roxie, a Street Sharks character that doesn\u2019t exist.\nSome people, Wikipedia and IMDB editors mostly, eventually caught on and rightfully questioned this nonsensical thing I did purely for laughs. The slow realization in this thread on \u201cobscure\u201d character Roxie is like watching a beautiful tree grow from weird seeds I planted. However, what fascinates me the most is all of the people willing to go along with the lies for seemingly no reason. Going along with a lie in person is a bit different, because you can be caught off guard and lie to regain your balance. On the Internet, though, where you\u2019re anonymous and have to take time to type and (maybe) edit words?\nI\u2019ve found forum posts of people saying Roxie was their favorite character, and read IMDB reviews of people fondly remembering episodes that don\u2019t exist.\nThe Riddle of Roxie confounds people to this day.\nHere\u2019s a review from August 25, 2004 written by IMDB user Ginger87 in New York City.\n\u201cStreet Sharks wasn\u2019t that bad of a show. I used to watch it about five years ago on UPN on Sunday mornings. I liked the animation, the plots, and the characters. My favorite character was Streex. He was cool. I also liked Roxie. She was also cool. My favorite episodes were: \u2018Attack of the shark bots (1),\u2019 \u2018Here Comes The Mantaman,\u2019 \u2018Clash of the Titans,\u2019 \u2018Follow The Leader,\u2019 and \u2018Cabin Fever.\u2019 I also liked the Street Sharks movie, \u2018The Shiva Saga.\u2019 I even have that on video. Overall I really enjoyed this show and it is a shame that it didn\u2019t last that long. I give this show 8/10 stars.\u201d\nNo, you don\u2019t like Roxie because you never saw her because no one saw her because she\u2019s not real. No, you don\u2019t have \u201cThe Shiva Saga\u201d on video because no one does because it\u2019s not real! Nine out of twelve people found this review useful, and it\u2019s an absolute lie.\nWhy would anyone do this? Did they recognize what I did and thought it would be funny to help spread the lies? Did they not want to look like they didn\u2019t know what they were talking about? Who are they trying to impress with their phony Street Sharks expertise? Here\u2019s an essay saying how Winkler\u2019s (fake) appearance on the show marked a new low point for him. Heck, voice actors who actually worked on Street Sharks and should know better, which includes still-relevant actors like Hamilton\u2019s Andrew Rannells, have retweeted people excitedly discovering that the Fonz was on the show. Henry Winkler was never on Street Sharks. It\u2019s a wonderful web of lies I\u2019ve weaved.\nThe thought that keeps bloggers up at night is that this kind of stuff is actually happening all the time. Whether it\u2019s purposeful long-term trolling or information that\u2019s been unintentionally incorrectly reported, the internet is rapidly increasing how radically and rapidly history gets rewritten. When everyone reports on everyone else\u2019s reporting, all it takes is one faulty source, one Roxie, to poison the entire cycle.\nHere\u2019s where the problem gets even more insidious and impossible to solve: Because I watched Street Sharks as a child and played with the toys (like the monster truck with shark teeth), my lies were mixed with half-remembered truths. My new version was still about four dudes who got mutated into grotesque, radical shark men, and even some of my casting was correct, since for some reason, I was really into memorizing cartoon voice actors at the time. That ambiguity, that Trojan Horse of truth, is probably why the lie was so effective and successful. Honestly, it\u2019s still hard for me to completely separate fact from my blurry fiction. I legitimately can\u2019t tell what\u2019s 100% real and what isn\u2019t when it comes to Street Sharks. That would be horrifying if it wasn\u2019t so funny. I\u2019m living in an ontological nightmare of my own making. It\u2019s jawsome!\nI\u2019ve shared this story with friends and family in the past, when the lies were at their peak omnipresence. Ziff Davis still hired me after I spilled the beans on the last day of my internship, and my student short film Followers includes a seeming non-sequitur about Henry Winkler in Street Sharks. But I\u2019ve never confessed this online. When I told my mother, a judge, she warned me against becoming famous for being a liar, especially since I\u2019m a journalist with a professional obligation to tell the truth. But like any worthwhile fiction writer, I believe my lies have highlighted an important modern truth: history is more mutable than it has ever been thanks to the explosion of information on the internet. We form a rough consensus based on vast amounts of conflicting data, but who really has the power to verify any of it? In the Metal Gear Solid series, a collection of sinister artificial intelligences manipulate bulk information online to keep the world firmly under their control.\nThis is especially true when the stakes are low. A lot of people will put effort into dispelling rumors that the Moon landing was fake or that Hitler is still alive, sure, but who cares enough about something as meaningless and easy to ignore as Street Sharks to make sure all the information about it online is totally accurate? Some people do, which is why my lies were mostly removed, but that took years, and they didn\u2019t fully stamp out every online instance of Roxie or Meathook.\nNot everyone can say they changed the world, for better or worse.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. How do you know I didn\u2019t just make all this up? First of all, I wish I could come up with a story this interesting and have the skill to alter all the necessary images on the spot. You can also look this all up for yourself. Search \u201cHenry Winkler Street Sharks\u201d on Twitter, check the dates on some of those confused forum posts, and tumble down this shark pit I\u2019ve been living in for over a decade. Even if I were lying, though \u2014 after all, you have no obligation to believe me right now \u2014 wouldn\u2019t that just prove my point?\nAnyway, here\u2019s a real episode of Street Sharks. You deserve it.\nThis story was originally published on Geek.com; it was updated on Medium on 6/15/2020."
