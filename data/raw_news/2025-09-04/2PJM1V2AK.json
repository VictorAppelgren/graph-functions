  "title": "Florida Plans To Eliminate All Vaccine Mandates\u2014What That Means For Us",
  "description": "Florida plans to eliminate all vaccine mandates. This will be costly to individuals, society, and weakens public health nationally and our epidemic response.",
  "content": "Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced on Wednesday that he plans to have the state eliminate all vaccine mandates.\n\nThis decisiion is shocking for a number of reasons and feels like he is opening Pandora\u2019s box. Over my 40 years of infectious disease practice, I stopped seeing sepsis from Haemophilus B or pneumococcus, as more people got vaccinated. I even had two patients with tetanus who hadn\u2019t been immunized. Before meningococcal vaccines were more often recommended, we had a small outbreak of meningococcal meningitis in our town, killing two teens and leaving one deaf.\n\nThere has been absolutely nothing worse in my 40 years of infectious disease practice than seeing children die of vaccine-preventable disease. I am still haunted by them.\n\nThose who want to undo public health have no personal experience with these diseases.\n\nVaccines have been one of the greatest public health successes, saving 154 million lives globally since 1974. This is equivalent to approximately six lives every minute.\n\nThis graphic about measles vividly illustrates the dramatic effect vaccines have had. Measles was considered eliminated in the U.S. until this year, with the outbreak that began in Texas causing a resurgence. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr has had a tepid response to that outbreak. While he has acknowledged that vaccines are the most effective in preventing measles, he has promoted the use of cod liver oil, saying he had heard of \u201calmost miraculous and instantaneous recovery\u201d from it. Instead, cod liver oil, which neither prevents nor cures measles, caused some hospitalizations from liver damage.\n\nAs of September 2, 2025, there have been a total of 1,431 confirmed* measles cases reported in the U.S., with three deaths, two of them in unvaccinated children.\n\nThe cost of an earlier measles outbreak was $3.14 million, or $47,479 per case. Future outbreaks are likely to be more expensive, as newborns infected with measles virus are more likely to experience serious complications, according to the report. The Center for American Progress notes that vaccination carries large savings. Each dollar spent on routine immunizations of children against infections saves $3 in direct medical care and more than $10 in costs to society such as lost wages due to disability, and parents\u2019 lost wages.\n\nIn his announcement, Ladapo likened the state\u2019s vaccine requirements to slavery. He continued, \u201cWho am I, or anyone else, to tell you what you should put in your body? Who am I to tell you what your CHILD should put in their body? I don\u2019t have that right. Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and God?\u201d Then he said that the growing skepticism of vaccines was \u201creflections of God\u2019s light against the darkness of tyranny and oppression.\u201d One might ask whose G-d wants children to die painfully or be permanently disabled from vaccine-preventable deaths? Or who wants a child to infect a pregnant woman or others who are vulnerable?\n\nThis year, we have had 266 children die from influenza, the highest since the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Ten babies died from whooping cough.\n\nWhile he is the Surgeon General of Florida, Ladapo was trained in cardiovascular diseases. He is not trained in epidemiology or virology. Ladapo has appeared in a video for America\u2019s Frontline Doctors and was a signatory of the \"Great Barrington Declaration,\u201d which promoted the idea of herd immunity rather than vaccines and isolation. He\u2019s said vaccines have been treated almost like a religion, and that\u2019s just senseless.\u201d\n\nBesides his support of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, Ladapo personally altered a Florida Department of Health Covid vaccine study to exaggerate the risks of cardiac death and discourage mRNA vaccine uptake. He further falsely claimed that mRNA vaccines could contaminate a person\u2019s DNA and called for a halt to using mRNA coronavirus vaccines.\n\nNow, Florida law requires immunizations for polio, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus.\n\nThe Department of Health also requires vaccinations against Varicella, or chickenpox, Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Pneumococcal conjugate, or PCV15/20. These are not required by law and are likely to be quickly rescinded.\n\nParents can get exemptions for religious beliefs\u2014except that the major religions support vaccination. They will expand that to include \u201cpersonal beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe state legislature will need to approve the changes proposed by Ladapo and Gov. Ron DeSantis, so they will encounter a slight delay.\n\nHow Will This Affect You?\n\nSome likely scenarios: A parent takes an unvaccinated child with a rash to the pediatrician. All the kids in that office are exposed to measles, and some become quite ill. Some are too young to be vaccinated. They may take the infection home to others. Some kids may appear to recover and then, approximately 1 in 600 develop Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a fatal brain inflammation.\n\nThink you or your child are safe because of \u201cherd immunity?\u201d No! Said Dr. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cYou were better off being unvaccinated living in a highly vaccinated community, meaning in terms of your chance of getting measles, than being vaccinated and living in a highly unvaccinated community, because in that situation, you\u2019re much more likely to be exposed, and no vaccine is 100% effective.\u201d\n\nImmunocompromised people will likely be homebound, not being safe in shared public spaces if many become unvaccinated.\n\nWe might see a comeback of congenital rubella, which occurs when a mother becomes infected with rubella and passes it on to her unborn fetus in the womb. The baby can have problems including heart defects, deafness, cataracts, neurologic problems or autism. The infant can shed infectious virus in secretions and urine for more than a year.\n\nOffit shared his views about the course of these current events as a \u201crejection of expertise, rejection of science, loss of trust and and people. As RFK Jr says, You don't need to trust the experts, just trust yourself. But so in the medical freedom movement, it is I'm going to do what I want for myself or my child, independent of how it affects other people. Whereas public health, you actually do have to, at some level, care about other people. You do and because it's really not your right to catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection, because there are people who can't be vaccinated because they depend on you to protect them. And that's that's the current tension.\u201d\n\nHe notes we've always had a social compact to take care of each other and the community, and we saw this with World War II, the 9/11 attacks, and the polio epidemic in the 1950s. \u201cWith polio, we saw ourselves as that, the victim of a shared tragedy. But something has happened where we just don't see ourselves as part of a whole,\u201d he observed.\n\nLadapo has also said he wants to eliminate quarantines. Offit responded that Ladapo\u2019s going to take away the two major arrows we have in our quiver. \u201cOne is quarantine, and two is vaccination.\u201d\n\nLooking at the future, Offit notes that we\u2019ve had three major coronavirus pandemics in the past 20 years. Presumably, there will be another one, and he thinks \u201cwe are far less prepared now for the next pandemic, given what just happened.\u201d\n\nIronically, today, the The Biothreats Emergence, Analysis and Communications Network issued an alert about \u201cEight deaths including three in healthcare workers in Bulape, DRC; Ebola virus disease or other viral hemorrhagic fever suspected.\u201d\n\nWithout vaccine mandates or the authority to quarantine, we have lost our major public health tools.\n\nOthers also reacted to Ladapo\u2019s announcement with dismay. Elizabeth Jacobs, PhD, is a retired epidemiologist and co-founder of Defend Public Health. She said, \u201c\n\nFlorida Surgeon General Ladapo\u2019s decision to end childhood vaccine requirements for school entry will cause immediate harm to the children, elderly, and immunocompromised in the United States.\n\nJacobs also noted, \u201cIt is likely that other Republican-led states will soon follow suit, in a pathological race to the bottom of vaccine coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s not just diseases that will spread from Florida to other states and around the world. The false concept that vaccination coverage should be optional will also spread, taking out herd immunity like dominoes.\u201d\n\nTeri Mills, MS, RN Emeritus, Nurses for America, echoed Jacobs\u2019 concerns that \u201cSoon these serious and preventable diseases will be crisscrossing the country.\n\nThere is NO cure for these childhood diseases, but there are many serious life-long consequences that occur with all too often frequency, including brain damage, becoming deaf or blind, damage to the immune system.\n\nMills also raised the question of who will care for the children. \u201cWe aren\u2019t living in the 1950\u2019s which was the last decade before most safe and effective vaccines were available. Today\u2019s household most likely includes 2 working parents. This means even if a child has a minor sequale of events, either the mom or the dad will need to be home as a caregiver, because schools and day care facilities prohibit attendance.\u201d\n\nWe also don\u2019t have the hospital beds, or nurses, physicians, lab and radiology techs and supplies to care for people in an outbreak or with long-term disability like from polio.\n\nAfter reading all this, please ask yourself why anyone would want to go back to the pre-vaccine days and destroy public health?",

      "text": "Florida\u2019s new Surgeon General and Department of Health Secretary is opposed to government shutdowns and vaccine and mask mandates, just like his boss, Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nDeSantis on Tuesday announced Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo, an associate professor from UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, will head the Florida Department of Health and serve as the state\u2019s top public health official.\n\u201cHe comes to Florida with really a superb background, bringing superb intellect but also, I think, will bring great leadership,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThis is a big deal to move across the country from Southern California to come to the state of Florida. But we feel Joe is just the right guy for the job.\u201d\nLike his new boss, Ladapo opposes mask mandates, government shutdowns, and vaccine mandates and recently wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal expressing those opinions.\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a remarkable stream of scientific investigation, but that knowledge isn\u2019t translating into better public policy. One example is a zealous pursuit of public mask-wearing, a measure that has had, at best, a modest effect on viral transmission. Or take lockdowns, shown by research to increase deaths overall but nonetheless still considered an acceptable solution,\u201d Ladapo wrote. \u201cThis intellectual disconnect now extends to COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The policy is promoted as essential for stopping the spread of COVID-19, though the evidence suggests it won\u2019t.\u201d\nLadapo said Tuesday that he was pleased to be in Florida working with DeSantis.\n\u201cFlorida will completely reject fear as a way of making policies in public health. So we are done with fear. That\u2019s been something that\u2019s been unfortunately a centerpiece of health policy in the United States ever since the beginning of the pandemic, and it\u2019s over here. Expiration date. It\u2019s done,\u201d he said.\nMore than 50,000 Floridians have died from COVID-19 complications following the surge of the delta variant. The last two months have been some of the most deadly in Florida for the pandemic.\nLadapo signed on to a document known as the Great Barrington Declaration, which argues that instead of concentrating on lockdowns, health authorities should focus most of their attention on those most at risk of dying from COVID-19.\nHe also co-wrote an opinion piece for The New York Daily News in October 2020, suggesting hydroxychloroquine is beneficial for patients.\n\u201cPeople in the United States and around the world should have access to it, and physicians should feel empowered to prescribe hydroxychloroquine to their vulnerable patients,\u201d the opinion piece notes.\nLadapo said Tuesday that he was friends with one of the authors, Jay Bhattacharya, the Stanford University professor who has been a vocal supporter of DeSantis\u2019s approach to the pandemic.\nPublished reports from last summer say that Ladapo joined a group known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Frontline Doctors,\u201d which put out a video aggressively promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine.\nBefore announcing Ladapo\u2019s hiring, DeSantis thanked former Department of Health Secretary Dr. Scott Rivkees, whose last day was Monday, and DOH Deputy Secretary for Health Shamarial Roberson, who leaves her post with the state in October.\nDeSantis noted that Rivkees, who came on in the summer of 2019, worked \u201cincredibly hard\u201d during his two-year tenure at the department.\nDeSantis noted that Rivkees worked \u201cvery hard COVID on a number of health issues affecting the state. And then, of course, when the coronavirus pandemic hit, it\u2019s really been a seven-day-a-week type of job. So I want to thank him for his service to the state.\u201d\nAlthough the Senate confirmed him, Rivkees faced scrutiny and tough questions about a reported history of sexually suggestive comments and his intention to continue working at the University of Florida, where he has remained a full-time employee.\nLadapo will have to be confirmed by the Florida Senate.\n_______\nFlorida Politics staff writer Renzo Downey contributed to this report.\n43 comments\nAlex\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 3:06 pm\nOh good.\nAnother irrational nutcase who refuses to honor his Hippocratic Oath.\nPeterH\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 4:37 pm\nMore DeSantis Stupid\nPediatric Dr. Rivkees couldn\u2019t tolerate DeSantis irrational Covid decision making another day! Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo Is an incompetent Donald Trump apologist. Stay tuned for more Florida death and overloaded hospital beds.\nThere is not a single reputable doctor, nurse or hospital who will listen to advisement from this idiot Ladapo.\nInformed readers should google his name an see what a national disgrace this \u201cdoctor\u201d embraces!\nIt\u2019s going to be fun watching the National media shred DeSantis over this decision.\nMary c Santana\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 6:22 pm\nI\u2019m reposting your perfect comment on my page.\nPeterHisAMoron\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 9:04 pm\nYou\u2019re a fucking idiot.\nAJ\nSeptember 22, 2021 at 12:00 am\nWhatever and I mean 110% of all of whatever the \u201cnational\u201d media says, is totally opposite of what is right, moral, and logical.\nAnd anyone that believes ONE WORD they say is a bat\nsh-it crazy mental midget.\nFighforfreedom\nSeptember 23, 2021 at 8:42 pm\nOh look another uneducated ignorant sheep. You are the problem. You are the host with your lethal jab. Keep taking it and one less stupid to deal with. Just can\u2019t fix stupid. Start digging your crave moron.\nCarol\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 5:54 pm\nSo happy to have a Ladapo on board who will look at the data and science to make relevant health decisions for Florida. So crazy and sad to think so many don\u2019t use common sense and would rather surrender to the media caused fear than look at what the data is actually showing or take time to research on their own. Of course people are already talking bad about him before he starts because our society has turned into a scene from meangirls where people lost the ability to treat one another with respect and dignity. We also don\u2019t use common sense in 2021 so I guess it\u2019s just par for the course!\nAlex\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 8:20 pm\nSo show us the data that says masks and vaccines don\u2019t work, but hydroxychloroquine does.\nCredible links only please.\nMike Guntle\nSeptember 22, 2021 at 8:51 am\nAll you have to do is look at Israel\u2026.85+% vaxxed, and the MOST cases per capita in the WORLD\u2026..this vaccine does NOT WORK. And pushing it is a direct conflict with the Hippocratic oath. Over 15K deaths \u201creported\u201d with this vaccine, and the real number is very likely more than 10 times that.\nPeterH\nSeptember 22, 2021 at 3:09 pm\nMike \u2026.. where are you getting your statistics? Fox News? Breitbart?\n1. Israel IS NOT 85% vaccinated. At best according to REAL STATISTICSvaccinated. So yes\u2026.. the latest surge did impact those unvaccinated Israelis!\n2. 15,000 people have not died from the vaccine. Your comment is 100% BS. THE VACCINES ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND WORK AS EXPECTED.\nSource; CDC, NYT, WHO\nCarol\nSeptember 23, 2021 at 4:54 pm\nYou could check out the 8 hour recording from the FDA meeting on getting a third dose of the stuff that they show doesn\u2019t work after 2 shots, aka \u201cbooster shot\u201d.\nDuring call they unanimously voted against for general use and had hour after hour or scientist, epidemiologist and other experts state the vax is not working, won\u2019t end the delta varriant and they are very concerned in the amount of deaths they are seeing from vax. They especially talk about how the use of it in kids is not justified and very dangerous due to the adverse events they are seeing and the fact that kids risk of mortality from the virus is basically nonexistent. They also look at the Isreal stats. You should take the 8 hours to listen, it\u2019s worth it!\nPeterH\nSeptember 23, 2021 at 5:36 pm\nTotal nonsense Carol. You have no proof. If YOUR nonsense was reliable we would see it on CNN or PBS! Stop lying!\nJames Evitts\nSeptember 28, 2021 at 9:17 am\nHea idiot after a year and a half where has masks done any good ! That is a big fact slapping you in your ignorant face ! Remember the saying ,definition of stupidity is doing the same thing the same way every time and expecting different results ! A year and a half and no change with masks ! So your ignorance is showing loud and clear !\nJohn B Sullivan Jr MD\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 9:42 pm\nThe science is clear. Masks and vaccines top covid, the Joseph Goebbel\u2019s of Florida will kill you!\nLinda Long\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 11:46 pm\nI am so happy for you in FL, I hope this action spreads like wildfire.\nKathy\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 6:28 pm\nI wonder how long Desantis had to search for someone who followed his theories. I guess there were no infectious disease experts available. Makes sense we would get someone\n\u201cwhose primary research interests include assessing the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic technologies and reducing the population burden of cardiovascular disease\u201d (from his CV).\n\u201cWe\u2019re done with fear\u201d? We should be terrified.\nAlex\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 8:14 pm\nLol\nNice.\nChristine\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 8:58 pm\nKathy, there are many doctors, epidemiologists and infectious disease experts, including Dr. Robert Malone, who invented mRNA technology, Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche, who invented MRNA vaccine technology, and the 100s, if not 1000s, of doctor\u2019s associated with America\u2019s Frontline doctors, besides thousands around the world, who agree with Dr Ladapo.\nJohn Sullvan MD\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 10:02 pm\nThat group is dangerous to the health of the public. Has covid 19 been stopped? No, thank people like good Dr. Lapado.\nIrla\nSeptember 22, 2021 at 3:51 am\nIt hasn\u2019t been stopped because people like you keep pushing this vax that is creating more variants.

Welcome Dr Ladapo! Many of us Floridians are thankful to have a man with your knowledge and honesty as our Surgeon General.\nAlex\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 9:06 pm\nLol\nThis guy was one of Trump\u2019s \u201cfrontline doctors\u201d but quit claiming he treated covid patients when he was asked for details.\nThe \u201cfrontline doctors\u201d made a video that Trump posted, but Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube took it down because it pushed disinformation.\nSo this guy is a quack.\nChristine\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 9:27 pm\nAlex, I\u2019ve seen epidemiologists post peer- reviewed double-blind studies published in respected health journals and have them censored and taken down by Facebook. Fauci himself has said many times in the past that masks don\u2019t work. Just so you know, Facebook censors aren\u2019t doctors or medical experts.. they are biased hacks. Facebook has an agenda. MANY wonderful caring reputable doctors are saying the very same thing as Dr Ladapo.\nJohn\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 10:04 pm\nMasks stop covid transmission. 80% compliance with masks that are 50% effective and you don\u2019t need a vaccine. Don\u2019t be part of the ignorant Florida minority.\nBruce\nSeptember 21, 2021 at 11:50 pm\nYou have ZERO proof of this.\nAnd any study that is out shows the exact opposite. They don\u2019t do jack.\nOf course you dingbat leftists are welcome to continue wearing your virtue signaling pacifier. Whatever makes you feel mentally comforted.\nMike Guntle\nSeptember 22, 2021 at 9:03 am\nI would like the link to that study\u2026the one I saw was 3% effective for masks. Please tell me how a mask can stop something that is .1 micron, when the smallest opening in a mask is 6 microns? It\u2019s like using a chain-link fence to stop gravel\u2026..useless\u2026.but\u2026that\u2019s science, and you don\u2019t follow that BS\u2026.\nDrB\nSeptember 23, 2021 at 11:24 am\nJohn, You are absolutely correct. I am a Ph.D. infectious disease researcher and microbiologist (25 years practicing). As such, I know how to search and interpret scientific literature as it is part of my profession. I have published/co-published more than 250 peer-reviewed scientific articles on infectious microbes throughout my career. In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( a preeminent journal for scholarly research), it is now categorically certain that masks do mitigate the spread of COVID. I include the citation and the abstract from a scholarly systematic review paper below. At least focus on the last couple of sentences. It is indisputable. There is no your science or my science\u2026.there is only science, and this is what the science is telling us. Masks clearly help.\nProc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Jan 26;118(4):e2014564118.\ndoi: 10.1073/pnas.2014564118.\n\u201cThe science around the use of masks by the public to impede COVID-19 transmission is advancing rapidly. In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory particles become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask wearing by infectious people (\u201csource control\u201d) with benefits at the population level, rather than only mask wearing by susceptible people, such as health care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.\u201d\nMike Guntle\nSeptember 24, 2021 at 9:25 am\nThis is a reply to DrB, since there is no link there I replied to this. I read the report he cited\u2026among the info there was\u2026.\u201dOverall, direct evidence of the efficacy of mask use is supportive, but inconclusive. Since there are no RCTs, only one observational trial, and unclear evidence from other respiratory illnesses, we will need to look at a wider body of evidence.\u201d and goes on to state\u2026.\u201dThere are currently no studies that measure the impact of any kind of mask on the amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles from human actions.\u201d So basically\u2026.we like to think masks work, so we\u2019ll tell you they do, even if they don\u2019t.\nSeekTheTruthInThisReality\nSeptember 22, 2021 at 12:40 am\nYeah look at the top 10 states with the worst death rates currently\u2026 they are almost all Ron Desantis esque.

They\u2019ve been nurtured for two years in coordination with Donald Trump\u2019s failed leadership policies.\nFor the past eight weeks DeSantis has marketed Florida as a maskless Covid free safe haven. This has attracted his national band of unvaccinated maskless followers to use our State as an experimental tourist Covid petri dish. The outcome was swift and predictable to anyone who believes in science.\nRightly so, Florida is now the epicenter for National and International media speculation on Covid mismanagement by elected officials.

Ladapo was also among the first state health officials to rally against the use of fluoride in drinking water, which Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also did earlier this year after Utah banned fluoride in its public water supply. Ladapo\u2019s goal to end state vaccine mandates, which often include immunization for measles, mumps and rubella, comes after the U.S. experienced its largest measles outbreak in 30 years. While the outbreak was largely concentrated in Texas, there have been 1,431 measles cases so far this year in 40 states, with six cases in Florida, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther Reading\nFlorida moves to end all school vaccine mandates, first in nation to do so (WaPo)"

      "text": "Who Is Dr. Joseph Ladapo? Florida's New Surgeon General Has Controversial Stances On Vaccines, Masks\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday named Dr. Joseph Ladapo, a medical professor who has expressed skepticism of vaccines, mask mandates and lockdowns as ways to fight the pandemic, the state's new surgeon general.\nDeSantis, a Republican running for re-election in 2022, has staked out a hard-line position against COVID-19 restrictions. He praised Ladapo as someone with a \u201csuperb background\u201d and \u201csuperb intellect\u201d who \u201cwill bring great leadership\u201d to Florida\u2019s public health efforts.\nLadapo opened his press conference with a fiery pledge that echoed the rhetoric of a governor who has been dismissive of global and national efforts to contain the pandemic.\n\u201cFlorida will completely reject fear as a way of making policies in public health. So, we're done with fear,\u201d Ladapo said. \"That's been something that's been, unfortunately, a centerpiece of health policy in the United States ever since the beginning of the pandemic and it's over here. Expiration date. It's done.\"\nThe comments drew national attention and immediately led to questions about Ladapo's credentials.\nLadapo graduated from Wake Forest University in North Carolina before earning a Ph.D. His medical degree is from Harvard University, according to one biography from the University of California Los Angeles, where he previously worked as a researcher. He has also listed experience working at New York University as a faculty member, a staff fellow at the Food and Drug Administration, and a residency at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.\nFlorida's new surgeon general has publicly rejected health measures implemented to fight COVID-19. Much like DeSantis, Ladapo is dismissive about the effectiveness of mask mandates.\nHis skepticism also extends to the push to get more Americans vaccinated as protection against the virus.\n\u201cThere is nothing special about them compared to any other preventive measure,\u201d Ladapo said about vaccines in his first press conference.\nHe criticized vaccination advocates for treating it \"like a religion\" and insisted that Florida would support measures to promote \"good health\" instead that include weight loss, exercise and eating fruits and vegetables. He has also supported controversial and disproven therapies such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.\nThe COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to seriously reduce the chances of contracting the virus as well as lower the risk of a life-threatening infection. While the Delta variant has been raging across the country, the vaccines available are still considered a strong defense against becoming seriously ill from the virus.\nLadapo is not trained in either epidemiology or virology but instead comes from a background as a cardiovascular specialist. He has written extensively on the response to COVID-19 since March 2020.\nThroughout the pandemic, Ladapo has voiced his view that hysteria was taking the lead from science in guiding public health decisions. In April, he wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal that warned against what he called \"Covid mania.\" The piece lambasted the \"zealous pursuit of public mask wearing\" and said that lockdowns \"increase deaths overall\" but are still seen as an \"acceptable solution.\"\nThis position has been adopted by opponents of COVID-19 lockdowns, but it has been met with skepticism from experts in the medical community.\nLadapo is also a signatory of what is called the \"Great Barrington Declaration.\" It criticized national health policies and pushes for an end to restrictions on those at the least risk of infection so that they may be allowed to \u201cresume a normal life.\u201d\nThe FDA has cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment for COVID-19. In an op-ed in October 2020, Ladapo advocated for it to be made more widely available to patients.\nHe also appeared in a video for America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, a group that has touted the use of hydroxychloroquine and cast doubt on the public health advice from the federal government. Ladapo told USA Today in July 2020 that he appeared in their video because he felt \"it\u2019s critically important for us to have a discussion that includes different perspectives about our approach to COVID-19.\"\nLadapo still requires confirmation by the Florida Senate before he assumes the surgeon general position. DeSantis said that if confirmed, Ladapo would also be maintaining his part-time professor position at the University of Florida School of Medicine.\n\u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2025.

It is a highly contagious but generally mild disease, and most cases do not lead to significant consequences.

It is a highly contagious but generally mild disease, without consequences in most cases. However, maternal infection during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause a fetal malformation syndrome called congenital rubella syndrome.\nEtiology\nThe enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus known as Rubella virus is classified as a Rubivirus in the Togaviridae family.\nEpidemiology\nCongenital rubella syndrome is a global public health concern with more than 100,000 cases reported annually worldwide. Natural rubella infection during pregnancy is one of the few known causes of autism.\nBefore the rubella vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1969, rubella was a common disease that occurred primarily among young children. However, rubella was eliminated from the United States in 2004. Since elimination, fewer than 10 cases have been reported annually in the United States, and most cases were imported from outside the country.[1]\nRubella continues to be a commonly transmitted infection in many parts of the world. Many rubella cases are not recognized, as the rash resembles many other illnesses and up to half of all infections may be subclinical.\nHumans are the only source of infection. Transmission is through direct or droplet contact from nasopharyngeal secretions. Once inhaled, the virus replicates in the respiratory mucosa and cervical lymph nodes before reaching the target organs via systemic circulation. The infectious period extends approximately 8 days before to 8 days after the rash onset.[2]\nMaternal rubella during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, fetal death or congenital rubella syndrome.[2] Few infants with congenital rubella continue to spread the virus in nasopharyngeal secretions and urine for a year or more. Rubella virus also has been recovered from lens aspirates in children with congenital cataracts for several years.\nPathophysiology\nPathogenesis of congenital rubella syndrome is multifactorial[2] and include the following:\n- Non-inflammatory necrosis of chorionic epithelium and in endothelial cells which are then transported to fetal circulation and fetal organs.\n- Intracellular actin assembly is inhibited by rubella infection, leading to inhibition of mitosis and restricted development of precursor cells.\n- Upregulation of cytokines and interferon in infected cells which could contribute to congenital defects.\nHistory and Physical\nFew or no obvious clinical manifestations occur at birth with mild forms of the disease. The incidence of congenital infection with rubella is high during the early and late weeks of gestation (U-shaped distribution), with chances of birth defects much higher if the infection occurs early in pregnancy.\nCongenital defects occur in up to 85% of neonates if maternal infection occurs during the first 12 weeks of gestation, in 50% of neonates if infection occurs during the first 13 to 16 weeks of gestation, and 25% if infection occurs during the latter half of the second trimester.\nSerious birth defects include the following[3][4]:\n- Congenital heart defects (patent ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects)\n- Auditory (sensorineural hearing impairment)\n- Ophthalmologic (cataracts, pigmentary retinopathy, microphthalmos, chorioretinitis)\n- Neurologic (microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, meningoencephalitis, behavioral disorders, mental retardation)\n- Hematologic (thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, petechiae/purpura, dermal erythropoiesis causing \u201cblueberry muffin\u201d rash)\n- Neonatal manifestations (low birth weight, interstitial pneumonitis, radiolucent bone disease leading to \u201ccelery stalking\u201d of long bone metaphyses, hepatosplenomegaly)\n- Delayed onset of insulin-dependent diabetes and thyroid disease.\nEvaluation\nMaternal screening with rubella titers in early pregnancy is considered standard of care in the United States. Rubella-like illness in early pregnancy should be evaluated to confirm the diagnosis. Laboratory diagnosis is based on observation of seroconversion with use of RV-IgG and IgM titers. Maternal counseling and termination of pregnancy are options in such cases.\nPrenatal fetal diagnosis is based on detection of viral genome in amniotic fluid, fetal blood or chorionic villus biopsies.\nPostnatal diagnosis of congenital rubella infection is done by detecting RV-IgG antibodies in neonatal serum using ELISA. This approach has sensitivity and specificity of nearly 100% in infants less than three months of age. Confirmation of infection is made by detection of rubella virus in nasopharyngeal swabs, urine and oral fluid using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).[2]\nCongenital infection can also be confirmed by stable or increasing serum concentrations of rubella-specific IgG over the first year of life. It is difficult to diagnose congenital rubella in children older than one year of age.\nPostnatal confirmation of congenital infection is important despite the absence of clinical features of congenital rubella syndrome. This is to develop a specific follow-up care plan for early detection of long-term neurological and ocular complications.[5]\nTreatment / Management\nPrenatal management of the mother and fetus depends on gestational age at onset of infection. If infection happens before 18 weeks gestation, the fetus is at high risk for infection and severe symptoms. Termination of pregnancy could be discussed based on local legislation. Detailed ultrasound examination and assessment of viral RNA in amniotic fluid is recommended.\nFor infections after 18 weeks of gestation, pregnancy could be continued with ultrasound monitoring followed by neonatal physical examination and testing for RV-IgG.[2]\nLimited data suggest a benefit of intramuscular Immune Globulin (IG) for maternal rubella infection leading to decrease in viral shedding and risk of fetal infection.\nAlthough symptoms associated with congenital rubella syndrome can be treated, there is no cure for the syndrome; hence, prevention should be the goal.\nControl Measures\nChildren with congenital rubella syndrome should be considered contagious until at least one year of age unless two negative cultures are obtained one month apart after 3 months of age. Neonates should be isolated. Hand hygiene is of utmost importance for reducing disease transmission from the urine of children with congenital rubella infection.[6][7][8]\nDifferential Diagnosis\n- Herpesvirus 6 infections\n- Measles\n- Parvovirus b19 infections\n- Pediatric contact dermatitis\n- Pediatric cytomegalovirus infection\n- Pediatric enterovirus infections\n- Pediatric mononucleosis\n- Pediatric mycoplasma infections\n- Pediatric syphilis\n- Toxoplasmosis\nPearls and Other Issues\nSignificant progress has been reported in the prevention of congenital rubella syndrome since the identification of teratogenic potential of rubella virus. However, more efforts are required to eliminate it. Since no treatment is available for congenital rubella syndrome, it is important for women to get vaccinated before they get pregnant. MMR vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, and due to its theoretical teratogenic risk, women who are pregnant and not vaccinated should wait to get MMR until after they have given birth. Although, several publications have reported the absence of congenital rubella syndrome after vaccination during pregnancy.\nThe antibody response rate to a single dose is more than 95%; after two doses, the response rate is almost 100%. Rubella vaccine is generally well tolerated with benign adverse effects like fever, rash, and transient lymphadenopathy.\nEven though rubella has become a rare disease in developed countries, lack of vaccination may lead to significant public health problems.\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\nOnce an infant with congenital rubella is diagnosed, an interprofessional team of nurses and clinicians should be involved in its care because of the diverse manifestations and family education requirements. Children with congenital rubella syndrome should be considered contagious until at least one year of age unless two negative cultures are obtained one month apart after 3 months of age. A birth the Neonate should be isolated. The nurse should emphasize the importance of hand hygiene for reducing disease transmission from the urine of children with congenital rubella infection. More important, all healthcare workers should encourage parents to have their children vaccinated against rubella.\nReview Questions\nReferences\n- 1.\n- Al Hammoud R, Murphy JR, P\u00e9rez N.

  "argos_summary": "Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced that the state will eliminate all vaccine mandates, a move endorsed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The decision threatens to reverse gains in measles, mumps, rubella and other vaccine-preventable diseases, potentially increasing outbreaks, healthcare costs and risk to vulnerable populations. Critics argue that the policy undermines proven public\u2011health measures and could erode herd immunity, while supporters claim it restores personal choice and reduces perceived overreach. The announcement on September 21, 2025 has sparked national debate over the balance between individual liberty and community health.",
