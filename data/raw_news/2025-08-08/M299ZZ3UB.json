  "title": "Trump Administration Subpoena Letitia James As $500 Million Civil Fraud Case Still Ongoing",
  "description": "Trump now owes approximately $513 million with interest after James sued him for fraud.",
  "content": "The Justice Department issued a subpoena to James\u2019 office for documents related to the civil fraud case, multiple outlets reported Friday, which The New York Times reports is part of an investigation into whether the case violated Trump\u2019s civil rights. James sued Trump, the Trump Organization and his business associates for fraud based on allegations that the president and his associates repeatedly misstated the value of their assets on financial statements for personal gain, with Judge Arthur Engoron agreeing with James and holding Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud. Trump has long denied the allegations in the case and insisted there was no wrongdoing in how assets were calculated, and has repeatedly attacked James, claiming she brought the lawsuit because she\u2019s politically biased against him and describing her as a \u201ccrook.\u201d The civil fraud case is still ongoing, as a state appeals court heard Trump\u2019s appeal in the case last September and has not yet issued a ruling over whether or not Engoron\u2019s ruling should stand. Engoron ordered Trump to pay $454.2 million in the case, an amount that keeps going up as the case drags out, as approximately $111,984 in interest is added each day\u2014now ballooning the total amount Trump owes to approximately $513 million. James has strongly opposed the Trump administration\u2019s reported investigation into her, with her personal attorney Abbe Lowell saying in a statement Friday, \u201cInvestigating the fraud case Attorney General James won against President Trump and his businesses has to be the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nHow the Trump administration\u2019s investigation into James will play out. There is no indication of any wrongdoing by James in her litigation against Trump, though it\u2019s unclear what conclusions the Trump DOJ\u2019s investigation will reach and how long the probe could take to play out. The Justice Department also reportedly issued a separate subpoena into documents regarding a lawsuit James\u2019 office successfully brought against the National Rifle Association, and the Justice Department has reportedly separately been investigating James\u2019 personal real estate transactions.\n\nWill Trump Have To Pay In The Civil Fraud Case?\n\nIt still remains to be seen how the appeals court will rule on Trump\u2019s appeal of the civil fraud case. The five-judge panel appeared somewhat sympathetic to the president when they heard arguments last year and suggested they could be inclined to lower the eye-popping sum he\u2019s been ordered to pay, which one judge referred to as \u201ctroubling.\u201d It\u2019s unclear when the court\u2019s ruling will come out. Interest on the amount Trump has to pay will keep accruing until the appeals process is fully over, and he will only have to pay if the courts still find him liable for fraud after the case has been fully appealed. He has already posted a $175 million bond in the case, after successfully persuading a court to lower the amount he immediately had to pay.\n\nForbes estimates Trump\u2019s net worth at $5.1 billion as of Friday afternoon. The president\u2019s cash pile has significantly increased since the civil fraud ruling first came out, making him fully capable of paying the nine-figure civil fraud fine. Trump now has approximately $770 million in liquid assets, up from approximately $413 million after Engoron\u2019s fraud ruling, with the bump largely thanks to the president\u2019s cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nJames sued Trump and his company in 2022 for alleged fraud, claiming the president and his allies repeatedly inflated the size and value of assets in order to obtain more favorable business deals. The allegations included false valuations for such Trump properties as Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower, where the Trump Organization exaggerated the size of Trump\u2019s penthouse even after Forbes reported the square footage the company had been using was false. Engoron first found Trump and his allies liable for fraud even before the case went to trial, and then ruled in February 2024, after the trial had concluded, that the fraud was committed knowingly, finding there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d suggesting Trump and his allies knew the numbers they were using were false. Trump himself \u201cwas aware of many of the key facts underpinning various material fraudulent misstatements,\u201d Engoron wrote. James is one of a number of prosecutors that Trump attacked as legal cases piled up against him between his two presidential terms, and the president has long suggested he wants to get revenge on his enemies while in the White House. In addition to the New York attorney general, the Trump administration has also opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led the federal government\u2019s two criminal cases against Trump.",

      "text": "Topline\nNew York appeals court judges signaled Thursday they may be willing to limit the nine-figure judgment against former President Donald Trump and his business associates, questioning the New York attorney general\u2019s office during a hearing and suggesting concerns that the litigation over whether Trump fraudulently misstated the value of his assets may have gone beyond what the state can legally do.\nKey Facts\nA five-judge panel heard oral arguments in the civil fraud case Thursday, after New York State Judge Arthur Engoron in February found Trump and his associates liable for fraudulently misstating the value of assets on financial documents in order to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump, ordering them to pay more than $464 million, including $454.2 million plus interest by Trump personally.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argued in part that the ruling should be overturned because no one was harmed by any values being misstated\u2014though the defendants maintain their numbers were accurate\u2014given that Trump\u2019s company paid all the companies it did business with in full and no one lost money.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office argued that doesn\u2019t matter because the statute Trump was sued under doesn\u2019t require showing evidence that anyone was harmed, but judges said the state may still have gone too far, saying there have to be some \u201cguardrails\u201d in place that stop the state from going after any private business.\n\u201cThere has to be some limitation on what the attorney general can do,\u201d Justice Peter Moulton told Deputy Solicitor General Judith Vale, who argued the case for the attorney general\u2019s office, after the court previously questioned bringing a case to \u201cupset a private business transaction\u201d between \u201cequally sophisticated partners\u201d in which the supposed victim had the power to conduct its own \u201cdue diligence\u201d and \u201cnever complained.\u201d\nThe judges also questioned the nine-figure judgment against Trump and his associates, saying \u201cthe immense penalty of this case is troubling\u201d given the businesses Trump worked with \u201cleft these transactions happy,\u201d and asking whether the fine should have been calculated differently, which would have resulted in a lower amount.\nVale defended the state\u2019s case, saying the massive fine was justified given the \u201cenormously favorable\u201d terms Trump and his associates got on business deals using the inflated valuations and the repeated nature of the fraud, also pointing out that companies did complain and stop doing business with Trump after finding out numbers were misstated.\nContra\nThe appeals court judges also questioned Trump attorney Dean John Sauer during arguments Thursday, pointing out that some of Sauer\u2019s arguments conflicted with previous rulings the appeals court has issued in the case. Judges asked why, if Trump is claiming someone had to be harmed to be found liable of fraud, the statute in question doesn\u2019t say that explicitly. Sauer was also asked about how the Trump Organization valued his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida\u2014claiming it was a private residence despite restrictions on its deed prohibiting that\u2014with the Trump attorney responding that its label is proper because Trump \u201chas been using it as a private residence since 1995.\u201d\nWhat To Watch For\nIt\u2019s unclear how long it will take the appeals court to rule on the case. If they uphold Engoron\u2019s ruling, Trump and his associates\u2014including sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr.\u2014face a range of punishments on top of the millions in fines, including being temporarily barred from running New York businesses. Trump can also still appeal his case to New York\u2019s highest court if he loses in this appeals court, though interest will keep accruing on his judgment while he does.\nBig Number\n$478.3 million. That\u2019s how much Trump now owes in the civil fraud case, including interest, which accrues at a rate of 9% per year, increasing the amount Trump has to pay by $111,984 per day, $3.4 million per month and $40.9 million per year. More than $24 million has accrued since Trump was first ordered to pay $454.2 million in February. The interest keeps accumulating while the appeals process plays out, and won\u2019t stop until the appeals process ends and Trump is ordered to pay. It would be dropped entirely if Trump were to win on appeal. The ex-president has already posted a $175 million bond in the case, after a court agreed to let him lower the amount he had to pay immediately, but he will still have to pay the full amount should he lose his appeal.\nForbes Valuation\nForbes estimates Trump\u2019s net worth at $3.7 billion as of Thursday morning, ranking him the 937th richest person in the world. Most of his wealth comes from his stake in Truth Social owner Trump Media and Technology Group, followed by his real estate holdings. Forbes estimates he only has approximately $413 million in cash and liquid assets, which is what would be used to pay the full judgment in the civil fraud case if his appeal fails. It\u2019s unclear how Trump will pay the full judgment if needed, given it exceeds his cash pile. Trump would most likely have to sell shares of his social media company\u2014even as the ex-president has claimed he has no intention to do so.\nTangent\nIn addition to the civil proceedings against Trump and his associates, the fraud case also led to criminal charges against former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury based on testimony he gave in the case. He was sentenced to five months in prison, but was released on good behavior in July after serving only 100 days. Weisselberg was charged after downplaying his knowledge that Trump vastly inflated the square footage of his Trump Tower penthouse, which Forbes reported in 2017 is actually 10,996 square feet, far smaller than the more than 30,000 feet Trump claimed on financial documents. Forbes\u2019 reporting showed Weisselberg was far more interested in the penthouse\u2019s square footage than he claimed during the civil fraud trial and in a 2020 deposition, and he was charged after Forbes reported Weisselberg lied under oath. While Weisselberg was charged based on his comments in both the deposition and at the fraud trial, he only pleaded guilty to charges based on the 2020 deposition. Weisselberg testified he wasn\u2019t aware of the size discrepancy before Forbes\u2019 piece and was not present while Trump exaggerated the penthouse\u2019s size\u2014but was actually present during a meeting with Trump and Forbes reporters in which Trump lied about the square footage, and internal emails and emails from Forbes show Weisselberg was aware of the discrepancy before Forbes\u2019 2017 piece was published.\nKey Background\nJames sued Trump, his associates and his businesses in 2022, alleging the ex-president and his business had misstated the value of assets more than 200 times in a 10-year span, including his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate and his Trump Tower penthouse. The misstated valuations were used to get loans on more favorable terms, the state argued, also claiming Trump used the figures to reflect a higher net worth for himself. Trump has strongly denied the accusations, with his lawyers arguing in court that the valuations are based on Trump\u2019s real estate expertise and blaming any issues on its financial documents on the Trump Organization\u2019s accountants, rather than Trump himself or his sons. The case went to trial last fall, with Engoron ruling even before it began that Trump and his associates had fraudulently misstated the value of assets. He then ruled again in February against Trump, deciding after the monthslong trial that Trump and his associates had knowingly misstated the assets\u2019 value for personal gain. While Trump and his lawyers tried to distance himself from any wrongdoing in the case, the judge ruled there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d suggesting Trump and his sons signed off on the false financial documents, and Trump \u201cwas aware of many of the key facts underpinning various material fraudulent misstatements\u201d in the financial statements and \u201cseverely compromised his credibility\u201d when testifying in the case.\nFurther Reading"

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note\nFormer Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to perjury on Monday. The charge stems from testimony he gave about the size of Trump\u2019s apartment during a July 2020 deposition and at the civil fraud trial in October. Under oath, Weisselberg said he had \u201cnever even thought about the apartment\u201d when asked why he signed off on financial statements attesting the apartment was larger than it actually is.\nForbes was the first to uncover Trump\u2019s lies about the size of his triplex back in 2017. It also was the first to offer evidence, citing emails and notes, proving that Weisselberg not only knew Trump had lied but that he had helped his former boss tell those lies. He now faces up to five months in jail. He already served nearly 100 days at Rikers Island. Here\u2019s a 2022 story that takes readers through these penthouse apartment lies.\nIt\u2019s September 21, 2015 and Donald Trump is wheeling around his Trump Tower penthouse like a realtor at a showing. \u201c35-foot ceilings!\u201d he exclaims in the living room. \u201cWe have a fireplace,\u201d he points out in the two-story dining room. \u201cCan\u2019t even get \u2018em anymore.\u201d He shows me the window where he claims he watched the second plane hit the World Trade Center. He directs me to a knockout view of Central Park. But more important to Trump than any one feature is the apartment\u2019s size: 33,000 square feet\u2013the entire top three floors of the skyscraper. He\u2019s mentioned it at least 10 times over the past two hours as part of a marathon meeting stretching from his 26th-floor office to the Trump Tower gym and, finally, his gilded palace in the sky, which he says is much bigger and much more valuable than we\u2019re estimating for our Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans.\nExcept none of it was true. I dug through property records, which showed Trump\u2019s apartment was 10,996 square feet and only took up part of the floors. I spent hours sifting through every photo or video shot inside the penthouse, looking for extra rooms. I visited a grungy Manhattan records office, where I was told the apartment\u2019s blueprints should be, but they were missing\u2013perhaps taken by the Secret Service, I thought. I even had our stellar research librarian unearth a copy of Architectural Digest from the 1980s that featured an earlier version of Trump\u2019s place, hoping to find evidence of the missing 22,004 square feet. No dice.\nThe records were clear: Donald Trump owned a 10,996-square-foot pad\u2013more than 6 times the size of the median U.S. home, but nowhere near what Trump claimed\u2013so I wrote a story, published in May 2017: Donald Trump Has Been Lying About The Size Of His Penthouse.\nLast year, I was subpoenaed by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office to testify about this article to a grand jury mulling criminal charges for Trump. Now, seven years to the day after then-candidate Trump insisted to me that his penthouse was 33,000 square feet, he\u2019s being sued for $250 million by the New York attorney general, in part for lying about its size. The former president has allegedly been overvaluing the place on the financial statements he gives to his financial institutions, as part of an alleged scheme \u201cto induce banks to lend money to the Trump Organization on more favorable terms than would otherwise have been available to the company, to satisfy continuing loan covenants, to induce insurers to provide insurance coverage for higher limits and at lower premiums, and to gain tax benefits, among other things.\u201d (Trump has criticized the investigation as a partisan witch hunt.)\nHere\u2019s the original Forbes story, now cited in the civil lawsuit against Trump, on how Trump faked the size of his penthouse, republished in full:\nDuring the presidential race, Donald Trump left the campaign trail to give Forbes a guided tour of his three-story Trump Tower penthouse\u2014part of his decades-long crusade for a higher spot on our billionaire rankings. Gliding through his gilded home, he bragged that people have called his Manhattan aerie the \"best apartment ever built\" and emphasized its immense size (33,000 square feet) and value (at least $200 million). \"I own the top three floors\u2014the whole floor, times three!\" He admitted to having once had a neighbor, pointing to a door on the 66th floor. \"I leased that little section to Michael Jackson. I knew him better than anybody.\"\nThose comments were typical Trump: boastful and inaccurate. We recently dug up New York City records showing that he still shares those floors with a neighbor and has been exaggerating the size of his own place by a factor of three.\nRecords show Trump acquiring a 6,096-square-foot triplex apartment, occupying sections of floors 66 through 68, around the time Trump Tower opened in 1983. A decade later he expanded his penthouse, merging parts of two neighboring apartments into his home, according to the filings. The end result is 10,996 square feet of prime Manhattan real estate\u2014a massive residence, no doubt, but much smaller than what Trump claims to own. No records filed with the city indicate that he has added or shed square footage in the years since.\nAs for that neighbor, it\u2019s Joel R. Anderson, an Alabama businessman who has owned a 3,368-square-foot apartment on two of the floors since 1996. Anderson has been identified in the past as a member of the Trump Tower condo board and he reportedly raised more than $400,000 for a library foundation in his hometown of Florence, Ala. by hosting an event called the 2005 Donald Trump Library Benefit Dinner. (Anderson could not be reached for comment.)\nTogether, Trump\u2019s and Anderson\u2019s penthouses combine for about 14,000 square feet. So where does Trump\u2019s 33,000 square feet figure come from? It\u2019s hard to tell. No one else lives on those floors, according to city records. Instead \u201ccommon elements\u201d\u2014things like hallways and elevators\u2014and mechanical space appear to take up the rest of the area Trump claims to live in. The residents of Trump Tower likely own these areas through their condo association, their stakes divvied up based on the size of their apartments.\nThat includes Michael Jackson\u2019s supposed penthouse: Records indicate the area Trump pointed to during the tour has never been a residence either. It appears to be mechanical space. (Jackson reportedly lived elsewhere\u2014on floor 63.)\nNo Trump spokesperson would comment on any of this, so using the correct square footage, we estimate the president's pad is worth $64 million, less than a third of his number."

      "text": "Topline\nFormer President Donald Trump and his co-defendants will have to pay $364 million for fraudulently misstating the value of his and his company\u2019s assets on financial statements, a New York judge ruled Friday, levying significant punishments against the ex-president and his business that could hurt him financially and affect his business\u2019 operations.\nKey Facts\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump, his associates\u2014including his sons\u2014and the Trump Organization for allegedly fraudulently misstating the value of assets on financial documents in order to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump.\nJudge Arthur Engoron had already found the defendants liable for fraud by misstating the value of their assets, but held a monthslong trial to determine whether the Trump defendants committed the fraud knowingly and violated laws on falsifying business records, insurance fraud and issuing false financial statements.\nThe judge ruled there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d showing Trump and his co-defendants intentionally conspired to commit fraud and knowingly submitted false financial statements, shutting down arguments by the defendants that they relied on outside accountants to verify numbers were correct and finding \u201cthat the buck for being truthful in the supporting data valuations stopped with the Trump Organization, not the accountants.\u201d\nEngoron said Trump was liable in that scheme, ruling the ex-president \u201cwas aware of many of the key facts underpinning various material fraudulent misstatements\u201d in the financial statements and \u201cseverely compromised his credibility\u201d when testifying, noting Trump \u201crarely responded to the questions asked, and he frequently interjected long, irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial.\u201d\nEngoron ordered Trump and companies he controls to pay approximately $354.9 million, while sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are each ordered to pay approximately $4 million, and former CFO Allen Weisselberg must pay $1 million\u2014totaling more than $450 million when interest is included, James\u2019 office noted in a statement Friday.\nThe judge also leveled other penalties, including barring Trump from leading any New York businesses for three years, while his sons are each barred for two, continuing an Independent Monitor\u2019s oversight over the business and appointing a new Independent Director of Compliance to oversee the company\u2019s activities\u2014ruling the Trump Organization \u201cdoes not have the ability to operate with a functional financial reporting structure that would protect against fraud in the future.\u201d\nCrucial Quote\nEngoron\u2019s ruling accuses Trump and his co-defendants of \u201cden[ying] reality,\u201d taking issue with their refusal to admit their valuations were wrong even after the judge found them liable for fraud. \u201cTheir complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,\u201d Engoron wrote, adding the defendants\u2019 \u201crefusal to admit error ... constrains this Court to conclude that they will engage in it going forward unless judicially restrained.\u201d\nChief Critics\nTrump decried the ruling Friday as a \u201cComplete and Total SHAM,\u201d claiming the judge\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on nothing other than having built a GREAT COMPANY.\u201d \u201cRacist, Corrupt A.G. Tish James has been obsessed with \u2018Getting Trump\u2019 for years, and used Crooked New York State Judge Engoron to get an illegal, unAmerican judgment against me, my family, and my tremendous business,\u201d Trump said in a statement. The ex-president\u2019s attorney Alina Habba decried Engoron\u2019s ruling Friday as a \u201ca manifest injustice\u201d and \u201cthe culmination of a multi-year, politically fueled witch hunt,\u201d while Eric Trump told ABC the ruling was a \u201ctotal joke\u201d and \u201cinsane\u201d and vowed the defendants would immediately appeal the ruling.\nWhat To Watch For\nTrump and his co-defendants are expected to appeal Engoron\u2019s ruling and it remains to be seen how long that could take to play out. Despite the appeal, Trump will still be required to either pay cash into a court-controlled account or secure an appeals bond within 30 days of the judgment. Trump has already separately appealed Engoron\u2019s ruling finding him liable for fraud, which also ordered for his business certificates to be canceled. That part of the order has been paused during the appeal, and Engoron clarified in his order Friday that it will now be up to the Independent Monitor and Director of Compliance to determine which certificates get canceled, rather than canceling them en masse.\nForbes Valuation\nForbes estimates Trump\u2019s net worth at approximately $2.6 billion as of October, with an estimated $426 million in liquid assets. From 2011 to 2021, the years covered by James\u2019 initial lawsuit, estimates for Trump\u2019s net worth ranged between $2.5 billion (in 2020 and 2021) and $4.5 billion (in 2015). Ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen alleged in testimony that Trump inflated the value of his assets in part to achieve a higher spot on Forbes\u2019 wealth ranking.\nSurprising Fact\nIt\u2019s possible the fraud trial could lead to other legal consequences, as recent reports suggest Weisselberg is now in plea negotiations with the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office for perjury charges. Weisselberg was pulled off the stand during the fraud trial after Forbes accused him of lying under oath, as the ex-CFO testified he \u201cnever focused\u201d on the size of Trump\u2019s Manhattan penthouse\u2014while notes and emails from Weisselberg\u2019s discussions with Forbes show otherwise. Weisselberg has not yet made any admission of perjury and no charges have been brought against him, but Engoron asked the state and defense counsel about the reports in a letter Feb. 6, suggesting that if Weisselberg perjured himself, his \u201ctestimony on other topics could also be called into question,\u201d and the judge could disregard it altogether.\nKey Background\nJames first sued Trump and his co-defendants in September 2022, accusing the ex-president and his associates of misstating valuations on financial statements more than 200 times between 2011 and 2021. The case moved forward to trial in October\u2014though Ivanka Trump was dismissed from the case in June\u2014and wrapped up with closing arguments on Jan. 11. While Engoron had already found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud by misstating valuations, the state argued at trial that the fraud was committed intentionally, claiming the Trump Organization was \u201cburning through cash\u201d between 2014 and 2017 and needed favorable business deals with lower interest rates in order to stay afloat and keep up Trump\u2019s spending. Cohen also claimed in court that Trump directed him and Weisselberg to intentionally inflate the value of assets in order to reach Trump\u2019s desired net worth, which Trump and his attorneys refuted, painting Cohen as a \u201cliar.\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys used the trial to distance the ex-president and his sons from the alleged fraud scheme, repeatedly claiming they didn\u2019t play a role in preparing the statements at issue, even as the Trumps signed off on them. Trump and his sons cast responsibility for any alleged issues on the company\u2019s accountants, claiming they relied on their expertise to ensure valuations were correct. The ex-president\u2019s attorneys also claimed any mistakes the company did make were victimless, because the financial institutions the company did business with were happy with Trump and did not lose money.\nTangent\nThe verdict comes after Trump was already ordered to make another high-dollar payment in his civil defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, as a jury ordered him on Jan. 26 to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her. Trump has vowed to appeal that ruling, but it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll also still have to put the money into a court-controlled account while he does so, as he already did in Carroll\u2019s first trial against him, which resulted in a separate $5 million damages verdict, or secure an appeals bond.\nFurther Reading\nTrump Fraud Trial Ends\u2014Here Are The Punishments He Could Soon Face (Forbes)\nTrump Fraud Trial: Here\u2019s What We Learned From Months Of Testimony As Case Nears End (Forbes)\nHere\u2019s How Much Donald Trump Is Worth (Forbes)\nTrump\u2019s Longtime CFO Lied, Under Oath, About Trump Tower Penthouse (Forbes)\nHow Trump Fooled Deutsche Bank (Forbes)\nTrump Thought His D.C.

      "text": "The Justice Department has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office as part of a criminal investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s longtime adversary, according to multiple sources, in the latest example of the Trump administration taking on the president\u2019s perceived enemies.\nThe US attorney\u2019s office for the Northern District of New York issued two subpoenas seeking information about James\u2019 investigations into the Trump Organization and National Rifle Association, the sources said.\nA grand jury investigation into James has also convened in Albany, New York, according to a source familiar. The grand jury probe into James is said to be looking into deprivation of rights, which means violating someone\u2019s constitutional rights, against Trump.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the subpoenas and grand jury investigation.\nAbbe Lowell, an attorney for James, said, \u201cInvestigating the fraud case Attorney General James won against President Trump and his businesses has to be the most blatant and desperate example of this administration\u2019s carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\u201d\nLowell added: \u201cWeaponizing the Department of Justice to try to punish an elected official for doing her job is an attack on the rule of law and a dangerous escalation by this administration. If prosecutors carry out this improper tactic and are genuinely interested in the truth, we are ready and waiting with the facts and law.\u201d\nCNN has asked the White House for comment on the investigation.\nJames is among of a long list of Trump\u2019s perceived political enemies who are now facing scrutiny from his administration. The Justice Department has opened investigations into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan, the Obama administration\u2019s handling of Russia\u2019 2016 election interference, former DHS official and \u201cAnonymous\u201d author Miles Taylor and former CISA head Chris Krebs, who was fired for saying the 2020 election was not rigged. The office of special counsel earlier this month launched a Hatch Act investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith, who indicted Trump twice in 2023.\nIn May, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed there was an investigation into James based in the Eastern District of Virginia over whether she committed fraud on a mortgage application. Lowell said that probe is focused on \u201cbaseless and long-discredited allegations.\u201d\nTrump civil fraud case\nIn September 2022, the New York attorney general\u2019s office filed a sweeping civil lawsuit against Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization, alleging they inflated the value of its properties to mislead lenders and insurers.\nA judge found Trump liable for fraud and ordered him to pay more than $450 million. Trump has appealed to have the judgment thrown out, which is still pending.\nTrump posted a $175 million bond while he appealed.\nTrump\u2019s hostility with James was evident during the 11-week trial, which took place in 2023 and 2024 ahead of his New York criminal trial. Trump railed against James from the witness stand and in the hallways of the courtroom.\n\u201cThis is a political witch hunt and I think she should be ashamed of herself,\u201d Trump said of James during a day\u2019s worth of combative testimony.\n\u201cYou believe this political hack back there and that\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d he said in reference to James, who frequently attended the trial sitting behind her attorneys.\nJames countered by making her own statement outside of the courthouse in lower Manhattan and through social media videos.\nIncluded on Trump\u2019s defense team in the civil fraud case was Alina Habba, who is now an acting US Attorney in New Jersey and one of several personal Trump attorneys who were appointed to positions in his Justice Department.\nHabba also frequently criticized the New York attorney general during the trial. In her closing statement, Habba went after James personally, saying: \u201cI looked back and saw her shoes were off this morning, and she had a Starbucks coffee.\u201d\nThe judge stopped her, responding that closing arguments had to stick to the facts of the case.\nNRA litigation\nThe attorney general\u2019s office also took on the National Rifle Association and won judgments forcing the organization to reform its structure.\nJames filed a lawsuit in 2020 to dissolve the NRA over allegations the organization violated laws for non-profit groups, committed tax fraud and took millions for personal use.\nA jury in February 2024 found that the NRA mismanaged charitable funds when it failed to stop top executives from diverting millions of dollars for lavish personal trips, no-show contracts and other questionable expenditures. The jury found that the group\u2019s longtime leader Wayne LaPierre, who had resigned the month earlier, should pay the gun rights group $4.3 million in damages for mismanagement and misspending charitable funds.\nCNN has asked the NRA for comment on the DOJ investigation.\n\u201cAny weaponization of the justice system should disturb every American,\u201d a spokesman for James\u2019 office said. \u201cWe stand strongly behind our successful litigation against the Trump Organization and the National Rifle Association, and we will continue to stand up for New Yorkers\u2019 rights.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

      "text": "Donald Trump posted a $175 million bond on Monday in his New York State civil trial. The news comes just one week after an appeals court ruled that the former president would not have to immediately post a bond for more than $454 million in the civil fraud case against him and his company. According to the ruling, Trump could delay payment of the full bond while he appeals the ruling as long as he posted a $175 million bond within 10 days.\nThe bond was provided by California-based company Knight Specialty Insurance Company. Trump\u2019s collateral to secure the loans was a combination of cash and investment-grade bonds, according to Don Hankey, the chairman of Knight Insurance.\nHankey told Forbes that his company had initiated the deal, reaching out to Trump just a few days before an appeals court lowered the amount Trump would have to pay while his appeal was heard. \u201cThis is what we do at Knight insurance,\u201d said Hankey, who confirmed he had supported Trump\u2019s political campaigns in the past. \u201cI\u2019d never met Donald Trump. I\u2019d never talked to him on the phone. I heard that he needed a loan or a bond, and this is what we do. So, we reached out, and he responded.\u201d The deal, Hankey said, came together in just a few days.\nHankey, a billionaire who presides over an auto-services empire, may never have met Trump, but he was the largest individual owner of Axos Financial, the lender that bailed out Trump by refinancing his mortgages at Trump Tower and his Miami resort in 2022. Axos also previously had done business with the family of Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law.\nSpokespeople for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe fact that Trump has come up with the money means that he\u2019ll be able to protect his assets from New York\u2019s attorney general Letitia James, who had warned that she would start seizing properties as early as late March.\nIn February, Judge Arthur Engoron had ruled that Trump had fraudulently misstated the value of his and his company\u2019s assets on financial statements and ordered him to pay $354.9 million as part of the civil fraud case plus a nine percent interest rate that Engoron ruled started accruing on the fines in March 2019.\nDan Alexander and Kyle Mullins contributed reporting."

      "text": "Topline\nA New York appeals court will hear the civil fraud case against Donald Trump and his business associates Thursday, as the former president appeals the nine-figure judgment he\u2019s been ordered to pay for fraudulently misstating the value of assets\u2014an amount that has risen by $24 million while he waited for the court to take up the case.\nKey Facts\nJudge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump and companies he controls to pay $454.2 million plus interest in the civil fraud case, in which he and his associates were found liable for fraudulently inflating the value of assets on financial statements for personal gain.\nThat $454.2 million total\u2014which includes pre-judgment interest\u2014goes up by $111,984 per day, $3.4 million per month and $40.9 million per year, based on a 9% annual interest rate.\nThat means Trump owes approximately $478.2 million as of Wednesday, as calculated using a penalty calculator created by Associated Press journalist Mike Sislak\u2014meaning his total has already increased by $24 million in the seven months since the judgment was posted on Feb. 23.\nThe interest will continue to accrue until Trump pays the full judgment, even as he appeals the ruling and the appeals court deliberates on the case.\nTrump has already posted a $175 million bond in the case\u2014as a court agreed to lower the amount after Trump\u2019s lawyers argued he couldn\u2019t pay the full bond\u2014but he will still be on the hook for the entire amount he owes, including interest, once the appeals process concludes, if Engoron\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t overturned.\nWhat To Watch For\nA panel of appeals court judges will hear the civil fraud case on Thursday at 12 p.m. Eastern time, with a ruling likely to come out a few months later. If the court rules against him, Trump could then appeal the case to New York\u2019s highest court and ask it to reconsider Engoron\u2019s ruling. Interest will continue to accrue for that entire period.\nForbes Valuation\nForbes estimates Trump\u2019s net worth at $3.6 billion as of Wednesday morning, ranking him the 966th richest person in the world. Most of the ex-president\u2019s wealth comes from his stake in Truth Social parent company Trump Media and Technology Group, however, followed by his real estate holdings. Only approximately $413 million is made up of cash and liquid assets, which would be used to pay the judgment against him, should he lose on appeal.\nBig Number\nMore than $540 million. That\u2019s how much Trump owes in total legal judgments against him since the start of 2023. While the fraud case makes up the bulk of that, a jury also ordered Trump to pay $83.3 million in writer E. Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation case against him, and he has posted an appeals bond for $91.6 million in that case (enough to cover the judgment plus interest). He was also ordered to pay $5 million in a separate lawsuit Carroll brought against him, as well as smaller amounts in cases including Trump\u2019s failed lawsuits against Christopher Steele who authored the controversial dossier ahead of the 2016 election; The New York Times and Hillary Clinton.\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\nHow Trump will pay the judgment if he loses on appeal. While Trump doesn\u2019t have enough cash himself, he could try to obtain a loan, seek help from wealthy friends or borrow against his real estate properties to make up the amount. The ex-president\u2019s attorneys previously suggested Trump could be forced to sell some of his real estate, which Forbes values at approximately $1.1 billion in total. That was before Trump\u2019s social media company went public, however, which now makes up the bulk of Trump\u2019s wealth. Trump has said he does not intend to sell his stock in the company after a block on him doing so lifted, though that could change in the future should he have to pay the full fraud judgment.\nKey Background\nJames sued Trump, his business associates\u2014including his sons\u2014and the Trump Organization in 2022 for allegedly fraudulently misstating the value of their assets on financial statements, which she alleged was done in order to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump. Judge Arthur Engoron agreed, finding Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud even before the trial in the case began\u2014it moved forward on other allegations\u2014and then ruling again in February there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d suggesting Trump and his sons signed off on financial statements knowing they were false. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued in court the valuations were correct, subjective figures based on Trump\u2019s real estate expertise, and tried to distance the former president from the alleged fraud, downplaying the statements at issue and arguing any mistakes with the numbers should be blamed on the company\u2019s accountants. Engoron did not buy those arguments, however, writing in his final ruling that Trump \u201cwas aware of many of the key facts underpinning various material fraudulent misstatements\u201d in the financial statements and \u201cseverely compromised his credibility\u201d when testifying in the case.\nFurther Reading"

      "text": "Topline\nThe New York attorney general\u2019s office and attorneys for former President Donald Trump finished making their cases this week in the ex-president and his company\u2019s civil fraud trial, ahead of closing arguments next month, bringing months of often-explosive testimony to an end as Judge Arthur Engoron weighs whether the Trump Organization intentionally misstated the value of its assets.\nKey Facts\nAttorney General Letitia James sued Trump, his business associates\u2014including his sons\u2014and the Trump Organization for allegedly fraudulently misstating the value of assets on filings to financial institutions, which James argues was done in order to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump.\nWhat Trump Knew: The trial questioned Trump\u2019s involvement in any alleged fraud scheme, with Trump testifying he would review the statements and has asked for changes to them, while ex-attorney and \u201cfixer\u201d Michael Cohen alleged Trump told him and then-Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg to inflate the value of assets in order to reach whatever arbitrary net worth Trump wanted for himself.\nTrump, for his part, downplayed the statements of financial condition when he took the stand, claiming banks didn\u2019t pay \u201cmuch attention\u201d to them and a clause in the documents absolved him of any responsibility if the numbers were wrong\u2014which is false.\nHis Children\u2019s Role: Trump\u2019s children Eric, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. distanced themselves from the financial statements when they testified, repeatedly claiming they had no role in preparing the documents even when they were presented with evidence suggesting they had a larger role then they claimed under oath.\nWho Gets The Blame: Trump, his children and other Trump Organization defendants blamed the company\u2019s outside accountants for any issues with the statements of financial condition, while accountants who testified said they were reliant on the Trump Organization to give them information and were not responsible for verifying the numbers\u2019 accuracy.\nWhat The Banks Think: Trump\u2019s defense relied on the argument that banks who did business with the Trump Organization weren\u2019t harmed by any false numbers in the statements and were happy to do business with him, and a managing director at Deutsche Bank testified the bank did its own valuation of Trump\u2019s net worth and wasn\u2019t concerned that it was much smaller than the ex-president claimed.\nPotential Perjury: Weisselberg and Trump both distanced themselves from the Trump Organization falsely listing the square footage of Trump\u2019s Manhattan penthouse as being three times its actual size\u2014making claims on the stand that are undercut by notes, emails and audio recordings of comments both men made to Forbes\u2014with the state abruptly halting Weisselberg\u2019s testimony after a Forbes article said he lied under oath.\nContra\nThe judge has already found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud by misstating the value of their assets, but he still has to weigh in on other allegations, such as insurance fraud, falsification of business records and whether the fraud was committed intentionally.\nTangent\nIn addition to substantive testimony about the alleged fraud, the trial was also dominated by theatrics and controversy over witnesses and court staff, as Trump frequently attended the trial and accused the state, judge and court staff of being biased against him. Engoron imposed a gag order in the trial\u2019s opening days that barred parties from speaking about court staff after Trump went after the judge\u2019s clerk, going on to levy $15,000 in fines against the ex-president for two violations of the order. The judge then expanded the order to include Trump\u2019s attorneys after lawyer Christopher Kise claimed the clerk was exerting improper influence over the judge. Trump\u2019s attorneys also asked the judge at least five times to issue a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d that would end the trial and rule in their favor\u2014which Engoron repeatedly refused. Among those times was because of a tussle in which Cohen appeared to admit to lying under oath, saying he had falsely testified to Congress that Trump hadn\u2019t directed him to inflate valuations. He then walked back that claim, however, saying that Trump hadn\u2019t told him directly to change the numbers but rather \u201cspeaks like a mob boss.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers asked Engoron to issue a directed verdict because Cohen\u2019s flip-flopping on his claims to Congress undercut his explosive testimony about Trump\u2014and when Engoron refused, the ex-president stormed out of the courtroom.\nWhat To Watch For\nClosing arguments in the trial will take place Jan. 11. Once they\u2019re over, Engoron will issue a verdict in the case, as the trial is a bench trial\u2014meaning there\u2019s no jury and only the judge decides the outcome. Engoron has said he hopes to rule by the end of January. Engoron will likely levy punishments against Trump and his co-defendants if he rules in favor of the state, with James asking him to impose a $250 million fine, bar Trump and his children from running New York businesses and prohibit Trump from making commercial real estate acquisitions for five years. Trump has already appealed Engoron\u2019s ruling finding the defendants liable for fraud, which remains pending, though the court has put on hold a part of the ruling that ordered Trump\u2019s business certificates to be canceled. The ex-president is expected to similarly appeal any verdict Engoron may issue against him.\nForbes Valuation\n$2.6 billion. That\u2019s Trump\u2019s estimated net worth as of December, ranking him 1215th on Forbes\u2019 real-time tracker of the world\u2019s richest people. Cohen testified in a deposition screened during the trial\u2019s opening arguments that Trump wanted him and Weisselberg to increase the value of his assets in part so he could achieve a higher spot on Forbes\u2019 wealth ranking. Between 2011 and 2021, the years covered by James\u2019 initial lawsuit, Forbes independently valued Trump\u2019s net worth as ranging between $2.5 billion (in 2020 and 2021) and $4.5 billion (in 2015). The attorney general\u2019s office alleges Trump used fraudulent valuations to boost his net worth by between $1.9 billion and $3.6 billion per year on the company\u2019s financial statements, which are separate from Forbes\u2019 valuations.\nBig Number\nMore than $168 million. That\u2019s approximately how much money the state claims the Trump Organization saved by using false valuations on its financial statements, according to an analysis performed by Michael McCarty, a banking expert who served as a witness for the attorney general\u2019s office. McCarty\u2019s analysis was based on the difference Trump paid in interest on loans that he secured using the allegedly fraudulent valuations and the higher interest rates Trump would have paid if he had commercial real estate loans, which would have likely been the case had his valuations been lower. The Trump Organization saved between $17.4 million and $73 million in interest on Trump\u2019s Mar-A-Lago resort, hotel in Washington D.C., the Trump National Doral Golf Club and the company\u2019s New York City property at 40 Wall Street, according to McCarty.\nSurprising Fact\nThe trial also included evidence showing how the Trump Organization was impacted by Trump\u2019s presidency, even as Trump stepped down from running his company before he took office. Trump Organization executive Patrick Birney testified the company floated adding a \u201cpresidential premium\u201d of 15% and above to the valuations of Trump\u2019s personal homes while he was president\u2014including Mar-A-Lago, his Trump Tower penthouse and Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey\u2014though the premium was ultimately not included in the final statement the company prepared for financial institutions. Documents entered into evidence during the trial also showed Deutsche Bank had reservations about doing business with the Trump Organization once Trump became a presidential candidate, with the company ultimately declining to expand its loan to the company during the 2016 election. Emails showed bankers were wary of approving an unsecured loan for the company at the time, writing the bank\u2019s decision against extending the loan was \u201ca global corporate decision to maintain neutrality to any political situation and not lend money to a highly politically exposed person.\u201d\nKey Background\nJames sued Trump and his co-defendants for fraud in September 2022, accusing the ex-president and his associates of misstating valuations more than 200 times on financial documents between 2011 and 2021. The lawsuit\u2014which also initially named Ivanka Trump as a defendant before she was later dismissed\u2014concerns valuations at many of Trump\u2019s most high-profile properties, including Mar-A-Lago and the Manhattan penthouse. James brought the litigation following a yearslong investigation into the Trump Organization\u2019s finances, which began in March 2019, when ex-Trump attorney Cohen testified to Congress that Trump had fraudulently inflated or deflated the value of his assets on financial statements for personal gain. Engoron found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud shortly before the trial began, ruling in September that the company\u2019s valuations were false and Trump\u2019s legal arguments defending them were out of a \u201cfantasy world, not the real world.\u201d The civil fraud trial also comes after the Trump Organization and Weisselberg were separately found guilty on criminal tax fraud charges brought by the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, which were based on unrelated allegations that the company evaded taxes by paying executives through gifts and off-the-books compensation.\nFurther Reading\nWhat Role Did Trump Play In Alleged Fraud Scheme?

      "text": "Update, March 22, 2024: Since Forbes published this article on March 2, Trump\u2019s cash situation has changed\u2014as have his claims about it. Forbes estimated in early March that Trump had $413 million in cash. On March 8, Trump posted a $91.6 million bond he owed after losing two defamation and sexual abuse cases brought by E. Jean Carroll; Trump has appealed those verdicts. By Monday, March 25, Trump is required to pay a judgment of $454 million (plus interest) after losing a civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Earlier this week, the ex-president\u2019s lawyers submitted a filing saying that securing a bond for the full amount Trump owes in the civil fraud case is a \u201cpractical impossibility.\u201d Then on Friday morning, March 22, Trump claimed on Truth Social, in apparent contradiction to his lawyers\u2019 statement, that he has \u201cnearly $500 million in cash\u201d and that he plans to use most of it for his campaign.\nCash, as the old saying goes, is king, but how much of it does Donald Trump really have? That\u2019s the $540 million question. Staring down at least that sum in legal penalties, mostly stemming from a fraud case brought by the New York attorney general\u2019s office, the former president is facing a cash crunch.\nIt would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to write a check covering the full amount, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued this week, in a failed attempt to lower Trump\u2019s bond in the case. Trump, the lawyers say, may be forced to instead sell properties \u201cunder exigent circumstances\u201d\u2014in other words, at fire sale prices, with \u201cno way to recover any property sold following a successful appeal and no means to recover the resulting financial losses from the Attorney General.\u201d\nIn a separate case, Trump requested a stay on an $83 million fine owed to E. Jean Carroll, a writer who successfully sued Trump for defamation and sexual abuse. Carroll and her lawyers opposed the request in a filing Thursday, writing that they have \u201cvery serious concerns\u201d about his ability to pay up: \u201cThe reasoning Trump offers in seeking this extraordinary relief boils down to nothing more than \u2018trust me.\u2019\u201d The money is due March 9.\nTrump himself testified in April 2023 that he had \u201csubstantially in excess of $400 million in cash.\u201d That\u2019s pretty close to Forbes\u2019 current estimate: roughly $413 million, good for about 15% of Trump\u2019s $2.6 billion in net worth.\nHere\u2019s how we arrived at that figure. We begin with an exact number: $293,834,128.42, which was Trump and his companies\u2019 cash balance as of June 30, 2021, per documents filed in the New York attorney general\u2019s case in October 2022. Our estimate in the fall of 2021, before the documents were released: $296 million, up from $110 million the previous year thanks to the refinancing of 555 California, the San Francisco tower he owns with Vornado Realty Trust, and also due to proceeds from selling condo units.\nNotably, Trump\u2019s 2021 balance sheet included some $90 million tied up in entities controlled by Vornado, his business partner on office buildings in New York and San Francisco. At the time, Trump couldn\u2019t access that money unless Vornado decided to disburse it to him, limiting the former president\u2019s ability to actually use the funds. It\u2019s not clear how much of Trump\u2019s cash remains under Vornado\u2019s control today. Vornado declined to comment.\nRegardless, from there, we can count up the major sources of cash coming in and going out by combing through documents revealed in the fraud case, Trump\u2019s public financial disclosures and other public records. We have not subtracted anything for income taxes. That\u2019s because Trump\u2019s tax returns, released by the House Ways and Means Committee in 2022, show that he doesn\u2019t pay much of anything to Uncle Sam. We also have not deducted contributions to his campaign (he hasn\u2019t made any) or his legal bills (he\u2019s largely paying those with donor funds).\nThe big takeaway: Trump is likely sitting on a huge pile of cash\u2014but not enough to pay off his legal creditors with a simple wire transfer. And with several more cases in his future and the New York attorney general looking over his shoulder, he\u2019ll need to find a financial lifeline. Fast.\nForbes\u2019 cash calculations are outlined below.\nSTARTING POINT\nCash as of June 2021: $293,834,128.42\nSmaller property sales: +$6 million\nSince June 2021, Trump and his fellow billionaire partner Phil Ruffin have sold off 25 condos in their Trump International Hotel Las Vegas tower for more than $10 million in all. Trump, who owns a 50% stake in the building, pocketed about $5 million. In Chicago, he sold a dozen parking spots at his skyscraper there for another $1 million.\nIncome from books, speeches and NFTs: +$21 million\nIn 2021, Trump released a book called \u201cOur Journey Together\u201d that consisted of public domain photos from his time in office, all captioned by the former president. His financial disclosures show that he made an estimated $5.75 million from the book. He also gave several high-dollar speeches in 2021 and 2022, earning him roughly $12 million, and he issued several batches of NFTs in 2022 and 2023 for some $2.1 million in cash (plus some additional cryptocurrency). Finally, \u201cLetters to Trump,\u201d a book reproducing his correspondences with various celebrities that he released in April 2023, adds another $1 million.\nD.C. hotel sale and related expenses: +$112 million\nThis is Trump\u2019s biggest payday: the 2022 sale of his money-losing Washington, D.C. hotel for an eye-popping $375 million, a figure that surprised independent analysts. After paying off the debt on the place, Trump\u2019s share of the sale came to roughly $127 million, per documents from his fraud trial. Subtract estimated expenses he faced keeping the place afloat before he sold it\u2014totaling $14.6 million\u2014and a $750,000 settlement with the D.C. attorney general related to his use of the hotel for his 2017 inauguration, and we\u2019re left with some $112 million from the hotel sale.\nTrump Links contract sale: +$60 million\nIn September 2023, Trump sold his contract with the city of New York to operate a public golf course in the Bronx for $60 million, according to testimony and documents made available in the fraud case.\nLoan payoffs: -$67 million\nTrump has paid off four loans on various properties since the 2021 report laying out his cash balances. Three were small: loans against Trump Park Avenue ($8.9 million), his golf course in Colts Neck, New Jersey ($8 million) and his golf course in northern Virginia ($5 million). The last loan\u2014his final remaining deal with Deutsche Bank\u2014was for $45 million lent against Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, which testimony in his fraud case revealed he had paid off in October or November 2023.\nAircraft expenses: -$13 million\nCourt documents from 2021 showed Trump planned to spend roughly $13 million on aircraft maintenance and upgrades, including an overhaul of his \u201cTrump Force One\u201d 757.\nFINAL TOTAL\nRoughly $413 million.\nWith additional reporting by Dan Alexander."

James accused Trump and his associates of inflating asset values to secure favorable business deals, leading to a judge's ruling that found Trump liable for fraud and ordered him to pay over $454 million, a sum that continues to grow due to accruing interest. Trump has denied wrongdoing and is appealing the ruling, while also facing scrutiny from the DOJ, which has been criticized as politically motivated by James' attorney.",
