  "description": "In a few years, a camera better than the one used to shoot Alien: Romulus could be in your pocket.",
  "content": "I'm something of a snob when it comes to smartphone cameras. Not as much as some people, perhaps -- the best camera is the one you have with you -- but nevertheless, I've done enough pro photography work that the flaws in phone cameras bother me. I had some tolerance for noise, blur, and lens flares when smartphones were newer and cheaper, but if I'm going to pay upwards of $1,000 for something like the iPhone 16 Pro, I expect quality images in most situations -- something I can share without friends wondering how I ever got paid as a photographer.\n\nIt's no secret that I've been a little disappointed with the telephoto camera on the iPhone 16 Pro, which only seems to deliver under ideal lighting. That's why a recent rumor about Apple's plans caught my attention -- if it comes to fruition, it may not just radically improve iPhone cameras, but also push the entire industry forward. In a few years, pro cameras might finally live up to their namesake as something only pros need to bother with.\n\nIn June 2025, Apple filed for a US patent (PDF) called \"Image Sensor With Stacked Pixels Having High Dynamic Range And Low Noise.\" Normally, that might not capture much attention -- while Apple has never built its own camera sensors before, it regularly files patents on concepts that never come to market. It's exploring possibilities all the time, and it's ready to stake its ground so competitors can't beat it to the punch.\n\nPeople were quick to point out, however, that Apple's sensor could provide up to 20 stops of dynamic range. For a primer, think of a stop as a full \"click\" forward or backward when it comes to aperture or shutter speed. The next stop up from an f/5.6 aperture is f/4, for example, and the next stop after a 1/500 shutter speed is 1/250. Half- and third-stops are sometimes used, but you often need to travel a full stop to make a meaningful difference in light exposure, and in the case of aperture, depth-of-field as well.\n\n20 stops is well beyond the 10 to 12 stops or so most phone cameras are capable of. In fact, that's also beyond many professional cameras, such as the 17 stops of the Arri Alexa 35, one of the most popular cinema models. By some metrics, Apple's patent describes a range closer to the human eye. All this is possible because of Apple's particular Lateral Overflow Integration Capacitor, or LOFIC, allowing each pixel to store varying amounts of light depending on how bright a scene is. Pixels also get their own memory circuits, which help to cancel out heat-generated noise.\n\nJust recently, a Weibo leaker known as Fixed Focus Digital claimed that Apple has actually developed the patented sensor, and may be testing it in experimental hardware. That hints at an interest in a commercial product, which makes sense -- while Apple has done well enough using Sony camera sensors, it prefers to use its own chip designs whenever possible. That enables more optimization, or at least more control from a business perspective. The company is even building its own cellular modems now, the first of which appeared in the iPhone 16e.\n\nHow Apple's sensor could change iPhones - and when\n\nIt's time to be a little patient\n\nFor one, issues with low-light photo and video could become largely irrelevant. You still wouldn't be able to shoot in a pitch-black room, and a moonlit forest might give you trouble, but the sort of noise and blur you see in a lot of restaurant and nightclub shots would disappear. You'd also be less likely to be kicked into iOS's long-exposure mode, which forces you to wait a few seconds while the camera captures more light. That can be a lifesaver, but only with completely static subjects.\n\nAs you'd guess, I'm most excited about Apple applying this tech to telephoto cameras. I'm almost always shooting in the 2x to 5x range on my iPhone, and the further I zoom in, the more likely it is I'm going to encounter blur from camera shake, even with Apple's optical image stabilization. Improved light sensitivity means a better chance at eliminating blur when lighting is less than perfect. Who knows -- I might be able to reliably shoot 5x indoors, instead of having to cross my fingers that the amount of light I see is what my iPhone is actually picking up.\n\niPhones might also become better for action work. They're pretty solid now, when lighting is good -- 28 Years Later was partly shot with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, albeit with thousands of dollars in add-ons -- yet you wouldn't want to use one to capture pro photos of an NFL game, and even the EUC rides I go on could stand to look better. In theory, Apple's tech could give people a better chance at freezing motion in a wide variety of lighting conditions.\n\nDon't count on any of this coming anytime soon, unfortunately. The iPhone 17 should already be in production ahead of its September 2025 launch, and if the new sensor tech is still experimental, it might already be too late to put it into the iPhone 18. If I were to bet, I wouldn't wager on it showing up until the iPhone 19 at the earliest. That's assuming that everything about the rumor proves true.\n\nI'd love to be surprised, and find myself shooting anything and everything on an iPhone 18 next year. But until I get hands-on proof that the phone camera revolution is here, I'm probably going to remain as snobbish as I've always been. That's not such a bad thing -- it's all in the name of taking photos worth looking at.",

      "text": "Summary\n- The iPhone 16 Pro's telephoto camera is sorely in need of upgrades to resolution and light sensitivity, since it produces noise and blur the main camera doesn't.\n- Telephoto quality is extremely important -- zoom produces better portraits, and in some cases, it's the only way of meaningfully capturing a subject.\n- It would make sense for Apple to stuff the iPhone 16 Pro's primary sensor into the 17 Pro's telephoto camera in fall 2025, but the company can be unpredictable sometimes.\nWhen I decided to upgrade from an iPhone 13 to an iPhone 16 Pro last fall, one of the major incentives was gaining a telephoto lens. There were other reasons, of course -- such as an always-on display, and Apple Intelligence compatibility for testing purposes -- but the telephoto was arguably more important. Coming from a pro photography background, I've always bristled at the idea of being limited to a 24mm main lens or a 13mm ultra-wide, at least without buying into third-party add-on kits that may or may not be usable the next time I upgrade.\nI have to admit, though, I've been a little disappointed with the 16 Pro's telephoto now that I've used for nearly 10 months. I'm glad I have it, and I continue to use it occasionally -- but it's made me question the value of buying Pro iPhones in general, especially since the base iPhone 17may finally get an always-on display too.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 Pro (3nm)\n- Display\n- 6.3-inch 1,206 x 2,622 pixel resolution 120Hz LTPO Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, HDR10, Dolby Vision, 1000 nits (typical), 2000 nits (peak)\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n4 changes I make immediately on a new iPad\nApple doesn't deliver the best iPad experience out of the box, but it's not far out of reach.\nWhat's wrong with the iPhone 16 Pro's telephoto camera?\nPromises versus practice\nOn paper, it should be excellent. It has a 120mm focal length, an f/2.8 aperture, and sensor-shifting optical image stabilization (OIS) to reduce motion blur. It's true that a lot of pro camera lenses will have longer focal lengths, and/or adjustable zoom -- my favorite Nikon lens was a Nikkor 80-200mm f/2.8 -- but 120mm is a great length for portraits, as well as some events if you're not in the nosebleeds.\nVery quickly, though, I learned that the sensor in the telephoto is substantially worse than the one in the main camera. It's not about megapixel count, although 12 megapixels will naturally produce less detail and room for cropping than the main camera's 48 megapixels. No, the real issues are light sensitivity and stabilization, one or both of which need to be better.\nThe real issues are light sensitivity and stabilization, one or both of which need to be better.\nIn bright conditions, mostly midday sun, the telephoto does a decent job. I've used it to take many a photo of my son playing at the park. But the moment things transition from \"bright\" to just \"well-lit,\" visible noise starts to creep in. Photos with purely indoor lighting can be a crapshoot -- some turn out fine, but others look like I'm shooting on a phone a decade old, even when the lighting isn't that different. It's often impossible to take an indoor action shot -- I've seen excessive motion blur that made me question whether OIS was working at all.\nYou might say it's unfair to expect high quality from something much cheaper and smaller than pro-level equipment, but that argument falls apart when you look at images from the 16 Pro's main camera. They're roundly excellent, even in low light -- I've shot photos at night or in dark rooms that my old Nikon D300 could never have achieved. Clearly, Apple made an intentional decision to use an inferior telephoto sensor. It almost feels insulting when you consider that here in Canada, a 16 Pro starts at $1,449 CAD. I'd feel legitimately ripped off if I'd spent $1,749 CAD on a Pro Max.\nI like my smartphones bright - here's what you need to know about phone brightness\nIt's nice to have the brightest screen possible, but you shouldn't necessarily take advantage of it.\nHow Apple can fix its telephoto cameras\nObvious and not-so-obvious changes\nApple should at least upgrade its telephoto sensors to match its main ones. A telephoto can be as important as a primary camera, if not moreso -- it's not only better for portraits, but often the only way of capturing a subject in any meaningful detail. Let's say you're at a wedding reception -- the gap between a 24mm lens and a 120mm one might mean the difference between filling the frame with the couple or mostly seeing the dance floor, and you shouldn't have to opt for the wider shot because the sun isn't directly overhead. You also shouldn't have to cross your fingers that a telephoto shot can be used uncropped.\nI'd like to see improvements to image stabilization too, but that might be a tall order in the design space smartphone cameras have to work with. The most important thing is a sensor with better low-light sensitivity -- any new OIS tech will be icing on the cake.\nSince the iPhone 17 Pro is rumored to be sticking to the same magnification as the 16 Pro, at some point, Apple's going to have to crack and move beyond 5x zoom. Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra can produce a 10x \"optical quality\" zoom, thanks to a 5x lens with a croppable 50-megapixel sensor. The leap between 5x and 10x isn't trivial. I find that a 200mm lens or longer is often needed for scenarios like concerts and wildlife, so the 16 Pro's 120mm can still fall well short.\n5 tips for phone photographers that make your pictures not suck\nYou can do a lot with a little if you think like a pro.\nThe prospects for a telephoto upgrade\nSooner or later...\nI wouldn't be surprised to see the iPhone 17 Pro bump its telephoto to the same 48-megapixel sensor found in the 16 Pro's main camera. Apple loves recycling parts, especially in a way that lets it spin them as an upgrade -- just look at the M3 chip in the iPad Air, or any given Apple TV 4K upgrade. It's also likely feeling pressure to compete with Samsung, not to mention Google, which put a 48-megapixel 5x camera in the Pixel 9 Pro. The Pixel 10 Pro is right around the corner, and it would look terrible if the IPhone 17 Pro was stuck with a quarter the resolution for years running.\nApple needs to wow me with real-world telephoto performance before I'll consider dropping money on another Pro iPhone.\nI'm surprised at what Apple will put up with, sometimes, so it's hard to say much with confidence. What I will say is that Apple needs to wow me with real-world telephoto performance before I'll consider dropping money on another Pro iPhone -- I can make 2x zoom work if I have to in order to save hundreds of dollars. That's money that could be put towards a better standalone camera.\nEverything you need to know about PEVs, or personal electric vehicles\nYou can use PEVs like e-bikes and scooters to explore, run errands, or speed up your commute."

      "text": "Summary\n- Apple's iPhone 16e offers a premium feel with excellent camera capabilities and a snappy A18 chip.\n- The iPhone 16e lacks key features like a higher refresh rate display and an ultra-wide lens. It's also priced roughly $100 too high.\n- The iPhone 16e caters to iPhone users seeking a budget option, making it ideal for those upgrading from the iPhone 13 or the iPhone 14.\nThat headline isn't a slight at Apple.\nWith the iPhone 16e, Apple has pared down the iPhone 16's key features in a smart way. It looks like a combination of the iPhone XR and the iPhone 14, only with a far more modern chip, a better display, and a solid camera. But it's not a perfect phone package and still lacks key features offered by comparably priced Android devices like the Pixel 8a (and soon, the Pixel 9a), including a higher refresh rate display.\nHowever, the iPhone 16e is more than good enough for iPhone users that don't need the latest and greatest from Apple. This is the phone for people like my parents that walk into their local Apple Store or wireless carrier and ask for \"the cheapest iPhone that's still good.\" Still, despite doing a lot of things right, the iPhone 16e is roughly $100 too expensive in the US at $599, and it's even more pricey in other regions (in Canada, the iPhone 16e costs an astounding $999).\nThis makes the iPhone 16e feel far less of an entry device than its specs would suggest. Which is a shame, as it's otherwise a solid addition to the iPhone family.\niPhone 16e\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 (3nm)\n- Display\n- 6.1-inch 2352 x 1170 pixel resolution Super Retina XDR, 1,200 nits, 60Hz\n- RAM\n- 8GB\nApple\u2019s new iPhone 16e is aimed at users on a budget, sporting many popular iPhone features while being priced much lower than its flagship counterpart, the iPhone 16.\n- Feels premium\n- Camera snaps great photos\n- A18 chip offers snappy performance\n- Roughly $100 too expensive\n- Sizable bezels\n- No ultra-wide lens\nHow we test and review products at Pocket-lint\nWe don't do arm-chair research. We buy and test our own products, and we only publish buyer's guides with products we've actually reviewed.\nPrice, availability, and specs\nApple's iPhone 16e starts at $599 from Apple's website and other retailers. First off, it's important to note that the device features nearly the same A18 chip as the iPhone 16 (just with one less GPU core). The phone's Super Retina XDR OLED display measures in at 6.1-inches, with a resolution of 2532 x 1170 pixels at 460ppi. The iPhone 16e's screen supports HDR, True Tone, Wide color (P3), and features 800 nits of brightness and 1200 nits at peak brightness (HDR).\nRegarding its camera, the iPhone 16e's f/1.6 48-megapixel camera offers 2x telephoto zoom through sensor cropping down to 12-megapixels, alongside image stabilization. On the digital side, the phone can hit 10x digital zoom. On the front, the iPhone 16e features an f/1.9 12-megapixel TrueDepth camera system that's Face ID compatible in its display notch (there's no Dynamic Island, however). Video support maxes out at 4K Dolby Vision video recording at 60fps, though most people will probably opt for 1080p 30fps.\nThe iPhone 16e is offered with 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB of storage. Colors include white and black (which are kind of boring and make me miss the colorful iPhone XR). Other notable specs include IP68 water and dust resistance (a maximum depth of roughly 19ft for up to 30 minutes). And finally, it's worth mentioning that the iPhone 16e is the first Apple phone to feature its own C1 modem. I haven't done extensive testing, but I didn't encounter any connection or speed issues tied to Apple's first modem (we'll likely see the C1 in the iPhone 17 series).\niPhone 16e\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 (3nm)\n- Display\n- 6.1-inch 2352 x 1170 pixel resolution Super Retina XDR, 1,200 nits, 60Hz\n- RAM\n- 8GB\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- iOS 18\n- Front camera\n- 12-megapixel (wide)\n- Rear camera\n- 48-megapixel (wide)\n- Others\n- Action Button\n- Dimensions\n- 2.81 x 5.78 x 0.31-inches (71.5 x 146.7 x 7.8mm)\n- Colors\n- Black, White\n- Display type\n- OLED\n- Weight\n- 5.88 oz (167g)\n- IP Rating\n- IP68\n- Price\n- $600\n- Release\n- February 28, 2025\nThe iPhone 16 offers nearly everything I want from a phone\nApple's base iPhone is a solid, all-around device that really should feature a 120Hz refresh rate display.\nWhat I liked about the iPhone 16e\nA solid-feeling device with impressive camera performance\nThe iPhone 16e feels excellent when you're holding it in your hand. Its matte rear has a premium look and feel to it (though it is a smudge magnet), and its aluminum sides feel sturdy and smooth. I'm also fond of the lone rear camera bump. The iPhone 16 series camera array is sizable and, especially when it comes to the iPhone 16 Pro, it's a bit of an eyesore. In contrast, the iPhone 16's lone lens is understated and sleek, which I appreciate. I hope we see something similar with the iPhone 17 series' rear camera array despite it featuring multiple lenses.\nShifting to the display, it's great that Apple opted for an OLED screen with the iPhone 16e's 6.1-inch screen. When comparing the iPhone 16e's and iPhone 16's screens side-by-side, both phones feature great-looking displays, though the former device includes a notch, while the latter features a more modern-looking Dynamic Island. Content is vibrant, whether I'm doom-scrolling on Threads or watching YouTube videos, but I can't help but miss the iPhone 16 Pro's higher refresh rate display (more on this later).\nOn the camera front, I've been very impressed with the iPhone 16e's 48-megapixel shooter. It's a very similar lens to the iPhone 16, only with a slightly smaller sensor, and its performance has been nearly identical in my experience. Under decent lighting conditions, the iPhone 16e snaps great photos that rival the iPhone 16's, offering excellent contrast, bright colors that are still true-to-life, and the ability to snap clear photos, even of moving objects and people. Low-light shooting is a little worse than the iPhone 16, but the difference isn't notable, and the camera seems to handle white balance poorly under challenging lighting conditions. The 2x zoom sensor crop is impressive, too, and rivals the iPhone 16's in my experience.\nThanks to the A18 chip, performance is solid across the board, and in my roughly one week with the iPhone 16e, I haven't encountered a single instance of lag. For those that care about benchmarks, the iPhone 16e hits 1,927 for single-core and 4,974 for multi-core on Geekbench 6.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is now my gold standard for phone photography\nApple Intelligence is still missing, but the Camera Control button and Photographic styles make for a worthy upgrade for photographers.\nWhat I didn't like about the iPhone 16e\nBig bezels and a sizable notch could turn some people off\nMy two most significant issues with the iPhone 16e are its sizable bezels, which I noticed the first time I picked up the smartphone, and its display notch. Both iPhone XR/iPhone 14 era design features make the iPhone 16e look far older than it actually is, similar to how the iPhone SE's physical Home Button made the 2022-released smartphone look like 2017's iPhone 8.\nIt's also disappointing that Apple opted for a 60Hz screen, just like it was with the iPhone 16. This is far more forgivable than it was with the iPhone 16, given the iPhone 16e aims to be Apple's entry-level offering. Other downsides include the lack of the Phone 16 series' Photographic Styles that happen earlier in the photography pipeline. There also isn't an ultra-wide or zoom lens either, which means you can't shoot macro shots (though I have found I've been able to get very close to subjects when shooting photos).\nI also think anyone upgrading from the iPhone SE line might take issue with the iPhone 16e's lack of a Home Button since, anecdotally, I know several older people who stuck with the positively ancient-looking smartphone solely for the physical button. At the same time, I'd say that those people need to give up the physical Home Button, because at this point, swipe navigation has been around for several years (it's pretty intuitive, too). Speaking of buttons, while the iPhone 16e features an Action Button, there's no Camera Control button. While I was initially very into the Camera Control button and its subtle adjustments on my iPhone 16 Pro, I find that I rarely use it now, so as far as I'm concerned, this isn't a huge loss and makes sense in the context of a lower-end device.\nWill the iPhone 16e's target audience care about these missing features and issues, particularly the less capable camera specs? Probably not, but they're still worth noting, especially if you're deciding between buying the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16. The one exception to this rule is MagSafe. I really don't understand why Apple didn't opt to include magnets in the iPhone 16e, especially given how popular MagSafe accessories are. You can buy a third-party MagSafe case to add compatibility to the iPhone 16e, but the magnets likely won't be strong enough for accessories like my beloved MagSafe PopSocket.\nThe new 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is $100 cheaper than the M3\nAfter weeks of rumors, Apple's updated M4 MacBook Air has arrived, and it's exactly what we expected.\nShould you buy the iPhone 16e?\nThis is an entry-level device for a very specific iPhone user\nWould I buy the iPhone 16e? Definitely not. I don't necessarily need the best of the best all the time, but I'd miss the Dynamic Island and I'm not fond of the sizable bezels. There are other factors, too, like the lack of a higher refresh rate display, and I've grown very fond of playing around with Photographic Styles.\nI'm clearly not the iPhone 16e's audience, though. This phone is for people that need a new iPhone and are currently on the iPhone 13, iPhone 14, or maybe the iPhone SE, who don't want to shell out the money for the pricey iPhone 16. In fact, I'd argue that the iPhone 16e will actually cannibalize the iPhone 16's sales. It offers all the features that matter to the average person, alongside a cheaper price tag. The iPhone 16e will likely make more sense from a price and feature perspective when the iPhone 17 inevitably launches later this year with a rumored subtle redesign and sought-after upgrades like a 120Hz ProMotion screen.\nThis device was provided to Pocket-lint by Apple.\niPhone 16e\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 (3nm)\n- Display\n- 6.1-inch 2352 x 1170 pixel resolution Super Retina XDR, 1,200 nits, 60Hz\n- RAM\n- 8GB\nNothing is turning heads again with its new Phone 3a Series\nNothing has officially unveiled its mid-range Phone 3a Series at Mobile World Congress 2025, but leaks spoiled much of the surprise factor."

      "text": "Summary\n- The iPhone 17 lineup will feature four new models, including an 'Air' to replace the 'Plus'.'\n- The design for iPhone 17 reportedly focuses on a new horizontal camera bar across the back.\n- All iPhone 17 models are rumored to have 120Hz displays, with the Pro and the Pro Max featuring ProMotion.\nLooking at your dusty old iPhone and wondering if it\u2019s time to upgrade? Same. The iPhone 17 is almost certainly arriving in a couple months -- Apple has debuted a new model every September for years. Although it hasn\u2019t said a word about its 2025 flagship (or even confirmed what it will be called), that hasn\u2019t stopped the rumor mill from churning out leaks and spilling Cupertino\u2019s most closely held secrets. Here\u2019s everything we know so far about Apple\u2019s next big thing.\nWith iOS 26, Apple is finally taking the iPhone's phone app seriously\nBy far, iOS 26's most useful new features are Call Screening and Hold Assist -- here's why.\nApple's flagship 2025 lineup includes four new iPhone 17 models\nThere's a new 'Air' model to replace the old 'Plus'\nApple is planning four phones for fall 2025: the base iPhone 17, a mid-tier iPhone 17 Air (replacing the old \u201cPlus\u201d), and the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The Air model is said to slot between the base and Pro in both size and price. Multiple sources -- from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo -- have reported this lineup change.\nA foldable iPhone is inevitable, and foldOS is ripe for unfolding\nIt appears increasingly likely that a folding iPhone will hit the scene soon - here's why a custom Apple foldOS operating system makes sense to me.\nThe iPhone 17 design centers on a wider, horizontal camera bar\nAt least for the Air, Pro, and Pro Max models\nApple\u2019s design overhaul for the iPhone 17 lineup centers on a new \"camera bar\" that stretches across the back of the device, replacing the traditional square bump on the Pro and Pro Max models. Both of these feature a wider, horizontal bump housing three lenses in the familiar triangular arrangement, with extra space between the lenses, LiDAR sensor, and flash. The iPhone 17 Air sports a single-lens rear camera set in an elongated bump, while the base iPhone 17\u2019s vertical camera module remains unchanged, according to Apple Insider, which went hands-on with dummy units of the lineup.\nLeaked CAD renders and another report also claimed the iPhone 17 will have a flatter chassis with ultra-slim bezels as well as an aluminum-and-glass two-tone finish on the Pro models.\n'Wow. This looks legit.'\nMost recently, a prototype sighting in the wild cemented what\u2019s been seen in mockups. In Los Angeles, X user @Skyfops shared photos of a person handling a supposed iPhone 17 Pro in a hefty black case, revealing a wider, horizontal camera bar, flash, and LiDAR sensor. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reposted the images, saying, \"Wow. This looks legit.\"\nFinally, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are expected to arrive in the following finishes: Black, white/silver, dark blue, and a bold new orange, according to leaker Sonny Dickson. The standard iPhone 17, however, will get black, white/silver, gold, blue-gray, and pink/purple, while the slim iPhone 17 Air could come in black, white/silver, gold, and blue-gray.\nHow to download the iOS 26 public beta on your iPhone\nThe iOS 26 public beta is finally here. Here's how to try the beta on your iPhone.\nEvery iPhone 17 model is rumored to get 120Hz display refresh rates\nBut possibly only the Pro and Pro Max will have true Apple ProMotion\nAll four iPhone 17 models are set to use the same fancy LTPO OLED panels that can hit up to 120Hz, according to display expert Ross Young. However, a Fixed Focus Digital leak suggested that, while the hardware supports 120Hz, only the Pro and Pro Max will get true ProMotion -- the standard 17 and 17 Air could be capped at a fixed rate.\nRegardless, here are the rumored screen sizes for each model:\n- iPhone 17 and 17 Pro: 6.27 inches\n- iPhone 17 Air: 6.55 inches\n- iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.86 inches\nI won't be buying a Pro iPhone until Apple fixes this camera problem\nA telephoto camera should be the main show, not just nice to have.\nThe iPhone 17 will be powered by a new A19 chip\nMeanwhile a new A19 Pro chip could be exclusive to the Pro and Air\nSeveral reports and insiders expect Apple\u2019s A19 chip to debut across the iPhone 17 lineup, with the Pro models (and possibly the Air) exclusively getting an A19 Pro variant for extra GPU cores and more efficiency. The same leaks, mostly Fixed Focus Digital, also suggest the base iPhone 17 will have 8GB RAM, and the Air, Pro, and Max could get 12GB.\n4 apps that turned my iPhone into a mini game console\nNow that emulators are an established app category on the iPhone, I've been using these four apps to experience a blast from the retro past.\nThe iPhone 17 will have Qi 2.2-compatible 25W wireless charging\nBut they will keep 35W wired charging\nWord on the street is that Apple will continue its move toward easily replaceable batteries and keep wired charging at up to 35W, with upcoming Qi 2.2-compatible chargers pushing 25W wirelessly, at least according to regulatory filings on Taiwan's NCC certification website. MyDrivers (via Wccftech) also said the Pro models may use vapor-chamber cooling. Neat, neat.\nI'm skipping Apple's ultra-premium 2026 iPhones, and you will too\nApple may be doubling down on the notion that wealthy fans are the most important.\nAll iPhone 17 models will get 24-megapixel front cameras\nBut the rear cameras are more varied per model\nThere\u2019s a ton of chatter about the iPhone 17\u2019s camera specs, so I\u2019ve compiled the latest model-by-model rumors below and tied them back to the design changes mentioned earlier.\nAll iPhone 17 models\n- 24-megapixel front-facing camera with six-element lens. This was first flagged by analyst Jeff Pu in a March research note and independently corroborated by Ming-Chi Kuo in a January report.\niPhone 17 base model\n- Dual-lens rear camera (Wide + Ultra Wide). This is according to CAD-render leaks and supply-chain reports.\niPhone 17 Air model\n- Single 48-megapixel rear camera in an elongated bump, as reported by Jeff Pu and supported by CAD renders.\niPhone 17 Pro model\n- Mechanical aperture wheel for in-camera depth-of-field control, according to The Information.\n- Dual-camera recording mode (front + rear simultaneously). This was uncovered by YouTube channel Front Page Tech's analysis of iOS 26 beta code.\niPhone 17 Pro Max model\n- Triple 48-megapixel rear sensors (Wide, Ultra Wide, Telephoto) with 5\u00d7 optical zoom, as rumored by Ming-Chi Kuo and echoed by Jeff Pu.\n- First-ever 8K video recording support. This was first noted by Mark Gurman in a Bloomberg report.\nWhat could the iPhone 17 Pro rumors be pointing towards?\nWith rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro hitting the social media feeds yesterday, I'm all sorts of confused about the direction(s) Apple is going in. We've got the alleged iPhone 17 Air hitting shelves (or rather floating above them if thickness speculations are to be believed) and now the supposedly super-thicc Pro model to go with it. It's feeling a bit like Goldilocks to me right now, even though trends have been logically moving towards thinner-and-thinner models for years now. I'm hoping that this means Apple has something new and exciting enough to warrant such a siesmic shift away from the thin, light, and 'it-just-works' trend... especially since it was the one that set it all those years ago.\nThe iPhone 17 might get a $50 price hike\nIt normally starts at $799\nApple traditionally starts its base models at $799 and Pros at $1,199, but Jefferies analyst Edison Lee now predicts a $50 price hike across the board, and you can blame rising component costs and tariffs.\n5 unexpected things I wish I knew before upgrading to the iPhone 16 Pro\nI traded in my iPhone 12 Pro and walked into a tech identity crisis.\nThe iPhone 17 will release in September, of course\nMost likely revealed during an iPhone event on Sept 9, 2025\nApple\u2019s iPhone event is expected the week of Sept. 8, 2025, most likely Tuesday, Sept. 9 (or possibly Wednesday, Sept. 10), with preorders opening the following Friday and units landing one week later (either Sept. 12 or Sept. 19.).\nApple has not confirmed any of the reporting in this article. Pocket-lint reached out to the company for a comment and will report back if it has anything to say -- though, typically, it stays quiet until revealing all during its launch events.\n4 moves that might help the Pixel 10 beat the iPhone 17\nThe launch of the Pixel 10 is fast approaching, and here are the steps Google should take to ensure it stands out.\nAll the iPhone 17 news covered by Pocket-lint\nEvery leak and rumor to date\nRefer back to these features, leaks, and rumors if you want to know more about Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and what\u2019s known so far.\n- July 30, 2025: The iPhone 17 Pro might have just been spotted in the wild\n- July 14, 2025: iPhone 17 potential launch date revealed\n- July 11, 2025: Apple may kick off 2026 with new MacBook Pro, iPhone 17e, and iPads\n- June 15, 2025: If this iPhone 17 Air rumor is true, Apple is making a huge mistake\n- May 28, 2025: The next Pro iPhone is shaping up to be an absolute unit\n- May 12, 2025: Apple might increase iPhone 17 prices without pointing to tariffs\n- May 5, 2025: 5 reasons I'm not excited about the iPhone 17 (even though I wish I was)\n- April 21, 2025: The iPhone 17 Pro\u2019s rumored giant camera bump could get an unexpected accessory\n- March 10, 2025: The iPhone 17 Pro Max might be thicker than you expected\n- Feb. 24, 2025: Apple's iPhone 17 is taking shape, and it looks a lot like a Google Pixel\n- Feb 20, 2025: iPhone 17 Pro tipped for a major RAM upgrade\n- Jan. 23, 2025: The iPhone Air could finally hit your pocket later this year\nStay tuned -- once September rolls around, we\u2019ll have all the specs, features, and pricing confirmed, at last."

      "text": "Summary\n- iOS 26 offers several new features exclusive to owners of the iPhone 15 Pro or later, all tied to AI.\n- Visual Intelligence can now be used on screenshots, for instance, mimicking Google's Circle to Search.\n- The Phone, FaceTime, and Messages apps support live translation, though only to and from a limited number of languages.\nI didn't buy my iPhone 16 Pro last year with future versions of iOS in mind -- mainly I was concerned with the aging battery in my iPhone 13, and upgrading to better cameras and display tech. But one of the benefits of upgrading any smartphone is continued access to new software, and with iOS 26, there's a growing list of features that will only work if you own an iPhone 15 Pro or later. That's the cutoff for Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools that's been controversial so far -- mostly because Apple has delayed promised features, like contextual awareness for Siri.\nIn the interim, there are several iOS 26 features that should make owners of newer iPhones happy. Some are relatively niche, but the ones I'm going to get into today could make a meaningful difference to you, depending on what your day-to-day existence looks like.\nApple iPhone 16 Pro\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 Pro (3nm)\n- Display\n- 6.3-inch 1,206 x 2,622 pixel resolution 120Hz LTPO Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, HDR10, Dolby Vision, 1000 nits (typical), 2000 nits (peak)\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n4 missing features I can't believe the iPad still doesn't have\nApple is making a real leap forward with iPadOS 26, but many of us still have a wishlist.\n1 Visual Intelligence for screenshots\nSearch for anything, anytime\nEffectively, this is Apple's answer to Google's Circle to Search for Android. When it premiered in iOS 18.2, Visual Intelligence was limited to whatever you could point your camera at, which was only occasionally useful. With iOS 26, it becomes an option whenever you take a screenshot, too -- you can ask ChatGPT questions about what you're seeing, and search on supported apps such as Google, Etsy, and Pinterest. If an image contains an obvious event such as a concert, the feature can detect it and suggest adding the day, time, and/or location to a Calendar entry. Expect to see a lot more flyers in your messages once iOS 26 becomes widespread.\nThis is Apple's answer to Google's Circle to Search for Android.\nVisual Intelligence isn't quite as convenient as Circle to Search, which can be triggered by long-pressing Android's navigation handle at any time. But both tools let you trace specific objects to search, so the comparison is pretty apt.\nWhat is Google Circle to Search and how does it work on Android?\nGoogle's latest AI feature is coming to the Pixel 8 and Galaxy S24. Here's everything you need to know.\n2 Live Translation in first-party communications apps\nLet's hope it catches the subtleties\nIn another bid to catch up with Google, iOS 26 adds automatic translation to the Phone, FaceTime, and Messages apps. It was pretty impressive during Apple's WWDC 2025 keynote, though the company used pre-recorded (and presumably scripted) demonstrations. I'm curious to see how well it works in real-world conditions -- translation apps often miss the nuances of context, like idioms. The results could be particularly entertaining in Quebec, where a lot of swear words are based on French Catholicism.\nSpeaking of which, language support is relatively limited to start with. The Messages app supports English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese. The Phone and FaceTime apps work with English, French, German, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese, but only in one-on-one conversations. Even within these barriers, many dialects are being omitted -- there's no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French or Mexican Spanish, for instance.\nHow to translate live conversations with Google Translate\nWith Google Translate, you have a translator in your pocket. You can translate and transcribe live audio -- including conversations -- in real time.\n3 Automatic order tracking in Apple Wallet\nNo more need for outside tools?\nApple has actually had an order tracking system in the iOS Wallet app for a few years, but until now, it required active participation on the part of merchants. This wasn't very appealing to companies with their own tracking systems, or anyone preferring a platform-neutral option. Often, when I'm tracking packages, I'll just use Shopify's Shop app -- I don't have to worry about being on an Apple device just to find out how close a package is.\nTo simplify things, iOS 26 automatically scans for tracking details in your email threads. That, of course, may be a limitation in its own right, if it's limited to the Apple Mail app and doesn't support the likes of Outlook or Gmail. But who knows -- for people with frequent deliveries, this could be an incentive to switch email clients.\nHow safe is Apple Pay really?\nAs a rule, any security threats are indirect rather than via Apple Pay itself.\n4 Automatic Reminders suggestions and sorting\nRemembering the things you forgot to remember\nI've never had a huge need for to-do apps, since normally, anything that's truly important to me has to be done right away or is impossible to forget. But even I make use of the iOS Reminders app occasionally, and some people seem to live and die by it. I get it, since it offloads some of the burden of remembering what your job, friends, and family need from you.\niOS 26 scans your email and Messages conversations for tasks you might want to add to Reminders, including items you can add to a grocery shopping list. To organize things further, associated reminders are automatically sorted into sections within each list. I imagine both of these things are going to be extremely useful for Reminders diehards, since we're often bombarded with a flood of communications every day. It's easy to forget that you need to call someone back when you're already late picking up your child from school.\n4 ways iPadOS 26 is finally making the iPad more like the Mac\nThe leap isn't complete, but iPads are a lot closer to becoming true laptop replacements.\n5 Apple Intelligence in Shortcuts\nAn undiscovered country\nThe Shortcuts app may be the most underappreciated part of iOS. I don't use it as much as I used to, but if you're patient, you can build some pretty elaborate automations to simplify tasks -- my \"I'm driving home\" routine is capable of texting my wife, getting Apple Maps directions, and loading an Apple Music playlist all through a single voice command. Chances are, if it's baked into iOS, there's a way of automating it via Shortcuts.\nI'm interested in this not so much for what's possible now, but rather what's coming once Apple delivers on its original AI promises.\nThe iOS 26 version of the app enables Apple Intelligence actions, such as image generation or text summaries. In fact, I'm interested in this not so much for what's possible now, but rather what's coming once Apple delivers on its original AI promises.\nI'd love to have a shortcut that automatically shuffles a specific Spotify playlist when it can tell I'm headed out on a group ride with my electric unicycle, for instance. The possibilities may be vast, even overwhelming for the average person -- it's a good thing people are sharing shortcut ideas online.\nEverything you need to know about PEVs, or personal electric vehicles\nYou can use PEVs like e-bikes and scooters to explore, run errands, or speed up your commute."

      "text": "Summary\n- Excellent AI-powered photography features, including the impressive Zoom Enhance and Super Res Zoom Video\n- Great-looking, Apple-like design with a great-feeling matte rear.\n- Simple software that's easy to navigate (but beware of some of the implications surrounding \"Reimagine\").\nGoogle's Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL are photography powerhouses with an excellent, iPhone-like design that even the most hardcore Android fans will likely admit looks and feels great.\nDid I expect to be this blown away by the photos and video Google's latest flagship can capture? No, definitely not, especially since there aren't notable camera hardware upgrades over last year's Pixel 8 Pro. Through excellent, surprisingly true-to-life post-processing, I find I prefer the look of the Pixel 9 Pro's shots over even those taken with Apple's iPhone 15 Pro, which had been my previous favorite camera array. Thanks to surprisingly useful AI photo and video features, Google's Pixel 9 Pro features what I'd confidently say is my favorite smartphone camera ever.\nAdd in the obviously Apple-inspired design with its smooth matte rear, minimized bezels, and tasteful color options, you have an impressive all-around smartphone package. Of course, you could argue that no one needs a Pixel 9 Pro series smartphone this year because the base Pixel 9 is a superb device that offers features typically reserved for higher-end smartphones, and I'd wholeheartedly agree with this perspective -- unless you're really into shooting photos and videos with your phone. If this is you, then the Pixel 9 Pro's additional cost is worth its more expensive price tag. Its cameras are really that good.\nThis review has been updated to cover the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Beyond the screen and battery size different, both smartphones perform identically.\nPixel 9 Pro\n- Brand\n- SoC\n- Tensor G4\n- Display\n- 6.3-inch Super Actua display 1280 x 2856 pixel resolution OLED (1-120Hz)\n- RAM\n- 16GB\nThe Pixel 9 Pro brings a new squared-off design, the Tensor G4 chip, and new AI features like Pixel Screenshots to Google's flagship smartphone line.

We buy and test our own products, and we only publish buyer's guides with products we've actually reviewed.\nPrice, availability, and specs\nGoogle's Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro are available directly from Google and other retailers for $1,100 and $1,000, respectively, in porcelain, rose quartz, hazel, and obsidian (the latter featured in this review). These prices are $300 and $200 more than the $800 base Pixel 9.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL features a 6.8-inch 1,344 x 2,992 LTPO OLED display, while the Pixel 9 Pro has a 6.3-inch 1290 x 2856 LTPO OLED screen. Both displays include a 1-120Hz variable refresh rate and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, with brightness reaching 2,000 and 3,000 nits of peak brightness, respectively. The Pixel 9 Pro XL's battery capacity is 4,700mAh, and the Pixel 9 Pro's is 5,060mAh. Their weights are approximately 7.7oz (221g) and 7oz (199g), respectively.\nStorage options start at 128GB and extend up to 1TB. This year, RAM has been upgraded to 16GB from last year's 12GB. The smartphone also features Google's Tensor G4 chip. Camera specifications include an f/1.68 50-megapixel main wide shooter, a marginally upgraded f/1.7 48-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and an f/2.8 48-megapixel telephoto shooter capable of up to 5x optical zoom. The front camera has been upgraded to an f/2.2 42-megapixel shooter from last year's f/2.2 10.5-megapixel lens.\n-\nPixel 9 Pro Pixel 9 Pro XL Brand Google Google SoC Tensor G4 Tensor G4 Display 6.3-inch Super Actua display 6.8-inch Super Actua display, 1344 x 2992 LTPO OLED, 1-120Hz refresh rate, up to 3000 nits peak brightness RAM 16GB 16GB Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Battery 4700mAh, 24+ hours of battery life 5,060 mAh, 24+ hours of battery life Ports USB-C USB-C Operating System Android 14 Android 14 Front camera 42-megapixel f/2.2, 103-degree FOV selfie camera 42-megapixel f/2.2, 103-degree FOV selfie camera Rear camera 50-megapixel f/1.68 wide camera / 48-megapixel f/1.7, 123-degree FOV ultrawide camera / 48-megapixel, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom, up to 30x Super Res Zoom telephoto camera 50-megapixel f/1.68 wide camera / 48-megapixel f/1.7, 123-degree FOV ultrawide camera / 48-megapixel f/2.8, 5x optical zoom, up to 30x Super Res Zoom telephoto camera Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, Ultra-Wideband chip, GPS, 5G mmWave, Satellite Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, Ultra-Wideband chip, GPS, Satellite, 5G mmWave Dimensions 6 x 2.8 x 0.3-inches 6.4 x 3.0 x 0.3-inches Colors Porcelain, Obsidian, Hazel, Rose Quartz Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, Rose Quartz Weight 199g / 7oz 221g / 7.8oz Charge speed Up to 55% in 30 minutes with 45W charge Up to 70% in 30 minutes with 45W charge IP Rating IP68 IP68 Price $999 $1,099 Security Fingerprint Unlock, Face Unlock, Titan M2 security coprocessor Titan M2 security coprocessor, Fingerprint Unlock, Face Unlock Year of release 2024 2024\nPixel 9 Pro build and design\nAn iPhone-inspired look even the most hardcore Android fans will like\nI covered it extensively in my Pixel 9 review, but I'm a big fan of the look of this year's Pixel 9 line. The Pixel 9 Pro adopts a look reminiscent of the iPhone, with its squared-off sides and slightly rounded corners that make it overall easier to hold, especially at awkward angles. The back is matte, unlike the Pixel 9's glossy rear, but unfortunately, its sides remain glossy, making them a smudge and dust magnet. I would have preferred a more premium all-matte-everything look that's in line with the iPhone 15 Pro. This not only feels better when you run your fingers over it but also repels smudges and dust better.\nUnfortunately, Google has ditched the visor for a sprawling camera bump that looks like it was dropped on the rear of the device. It's not a deal-breaker, especially if you plan to put the device in a smartphone case, but it's a step back from the identifiable rear camera visor featured in last year's Pixel 8 Pro.\nOverall, the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL are very solid-looking smartphones that offer a level of refinement instantly noticeable from the moment you pick it up. Pixel devices have always felt pretty good, but the Pixel 9 Pro series takes things to another level.\nIt's worth noting that this is the first time Google has offered a larger 6.8-inch version of its higher-end smartphone. A 6.8-inch screen is a decent size, and in my time with the device, it hasn't felt unwieldy. People like big phones, so it makes sense for Google to offer a bigger option. But I prefer the smaller 6.3-inch Pixel 9 Pro (it's just easier to use with one hand). Of course, this will come down to your personal smartphone size preference.\nThe Pixel 9 is a nearly perfect Android phone that also terrifies me\nThe Pixel 9 delivers stunning performance and design, but its Reimagine AI tool truly scares me.\nPixel 9 Pro display\nA stunning, high-end display that looks great under nearly all lighting conditions\nThe Pixel 9 Pro's display is stunning, surpassing the vibrancy of Apple's iPhone 15 Pro screen and, in some cases, even Samsung's Galaxy S24 series, by a significant margin. The Pixel 9's screen is more than bright enough at 1,800 nits with 2,700 nits of peak brightness, but the Pixel 9 Pro's display takes things to a blistering 2,000 nits with up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness.\nColors are vibrant, and photos, videos, and games look sharp, but not wildly better than my experience with Google's base Pixel 9, despite its OLED construction versus the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro's higher-end LTPO screen technology.\nThe display looks great, but at times, I've actually found it too bright, especially when viewing content under dark conditions, forcing me to turn the brightness down. On the other hand, I appreciate the added illumination when using the device outside under direct sunlight. You can also clearly see how much brighter the Pixel 9 Pro display is when compared directly with the Pixel 9's screen.\nBoth the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL sport higher resolution displays than the Pixel 9, at 1344 x 2992 and 1280 x 2856 pixel resolution, respectively. Colors are vibrant, and photos, videos, and games look sharp, but not wildly better than my experience with Google's base Pixel 9, despite its OLED construction versus the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro's higher-end LTPO screen technology. To me, this just speaks to how good all the displays in Google's Pixel 9 lineup are.\nAs a negative side note, I managed to get a very nasty scratch toward the middle of the Pixel 9 Pro XL's display, despite its supposedly durable Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 construction. I'm pretty careful with my devices, so I have no clue how this happened, but it's worth mentioning. That said, I don't think this is a widespread issue with the Pixel 9 Pro display and it's probably just bad luck on my part.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is great, but here are 5 reasons why I\u2019m waiting for the Pixel 10 Pro\nGoogle's Pixel 9 Pro is a slam-dunk success, but I'm still not convinced it's time to take the Pixel plunge.\nPixel 9 Pro camera\nThis year's key selling point is excellent camera performance (and not only because of AI)\nThe main reason to purchase the Pixel 9 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro XL over the Pixel 9 is for the extra camera features the higher-end phones offer. First off, the Pixel 9 Pro XL features a f/2.2 48-megapixel telephoto lens with up to 5x optical zoom. These are the same specs as last year, and overall, images shot with this camera look stellar. I still prefer a telephoto lens over an ultra-wide, and it would be great if Google ditched the latter from its base Pixel 9 in favor of a real optical zoom.\nOn the AI side of things, \"Super Res Zoom Video\" is back again and a bit more impressive than last year. The visual upgrade is still somewhat minimal, but clips look noticeably clearer in most cases. The feature is frustrating to activate as it requires you to turn on \"Video Boost\" and switch to 5x optical zoom before zooming into whatever digital zoom you desire, but it works well and remains impressive. As you can see above, the fish are slightly clearer and more vibrant in the Super Res Zoom enhanced clip above, even with X's dismal video transcoding.\nOn that same note, Video Boost also remains impressive, particularly when it comes to smoothing out panning, which is still strangely choppy with the Pixel 9 Pro line, especially when switching between lenses (the iPhone 15 Pro beats the Pixel 9 Pro regarding video). It would be great if there was a way to turn on Video Boost permanently, though I understand why there isn't given that the feature requires every file to be uploaded to Google's servers. Like last year, videos can sometimes get stuck converting to Video Boost and take upwards of 30 minutes to process, especially if you use the Pixel 9 Pro line's new 8K upscaling (this is a welcome addition, but I don't have much use for 8K footage). This means if you're looking to post something quickly, Video Boost often isn't an option.\nSticking with getting closer to subjects, this year \"Zoom Enhance\" allows you to improve the quality of images shot with digital zoom. Similar to Super Res Zoom Video, the changes are subtle but still noticeable, giving zoomed photos more definition and an overall slightly clearer picture that's often more vibrant. Typically, the farther you zoom in digitally, the more impressive the results are when using Zoom Enhance. The improvements are pretty minimal, but if you're into photography, you'll notice them.\nOn the optical zoom side, images are clear, crisp, and impressive, particularly at 5x, which I found very useful on a recent sailing trip. However, I have experienced camera tilt at 5x zoom that causes images to be somewhat off-kilter. I've been fixing this with a quick crop, but I'm confident Google will resolve this issue in the coming weeks with a camera app update. Along with the already mentioned telephoto lens, the Pixel 9 Pro series features an f/1.7 50-megapixel wide camera that's the same as last year's primary camera.\nIt still snaps great photos that strike a balance between the over-processed feel of Samsung's Galaxy series and the increasingly out-of-this-world take on photography Apple has been pushing for the last few years (take a look at the sky in iPhone 15 Pro photos, and you'll see what I mean). Of all the flagship smartphones currently available, the Pixel 9 series offers the most true-to-life shots, which is a little ironic given the tech giant's emphasis on AI this year, bringing into question what a photograph even is anymore.\nPixel 9 camera features like \"Add Me,\" which allows you to create a composite group shot without asking a stranger to snap the photo, are also part of the Pixel 9 Pro series' quiver of AI-powered functionality. \"Add Me\" works just as well with the Pixel 9 Pro line and is the kind of innocent AI feature I actually find useful.\nOne important thing to note is that the Pixel 9 Pro's AI camera features do not work when you have the main shooter set to 48 megapixels instead of 12 megapixels, which is a disappointing move on Google's part. This likely has something to do with the current AI processing pipeline and how Google utilizes the larger sensor, but it would be great to see compatibility with 48-megapixel shots in the Pixel 10 Pro series nonetheless.\nIt was still possible to quickly snap the photos I wanted with the 48-megapixel sensor, but I needed to be very intentional with my shots.\nSpeaking of 48-megapixel shots, I don't find the need to snap them very often unless I intend to crop the image in some way. The shutter is also still a bit slower when using the full sensor, making it difficult to rapidly take photos, which was a challenge while snapping pictures at the Toronto International Airshow, forcing me to mostly stick to 12-megapixel images. It was still possible to quickly snap the photos I wanted with the 48-megapixel sensor, but I needed to be very intentional with my shots.\nThere's also the f/1.7 48-megapixel ultra-wide shooter that offers a minor upgrade over last year's ultra-wide. It snaps decent photos, but beyond the occasional macro shot, I don't find myself using the ultra-wide camera very often. And finally, there's the f/2.2 42-megapixel front-facing camera that snaps clearer pictures than last year's selfie shooter. I'm not a big selfie person, but the photos I shot are clear, with even exposure throughout. I often find that selfie cameras blow out an image's highlights, and that's not the case with the Pixel 9 Pro series' front-facing camera.\nThe Pixel 9's Super Res Zoom hits the sweet spot -- the rest is AI overkill\nThe Pixel 9 Pro supports Super Res Zoom in video for the first time, and it's a good example of AI-enabled features that make sense on Google's phone.\nPixel 9 Pro XL performance\nThe Tensor G4 benchmarks under the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but who cares?\nOn the performance side, Google's Tensor G4 runs great in the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Even under a heavy load, I didn't experience the same heat issues as I occasionally encountered with the Pixel 8 Pro, likely because of the new internal cooling design and the phone's larger size. However, the Tensor G4 is not that much of a jump over the Pixel 8 Pro in terms of raw performance. For those who care about benchmarks, the Pixel 9 Pro XL scores 1,901 for single-core and 4,707 for multi-core, while the Pixel 9 Pro hits 1,966 for single-core and 4,723 for multi-core.\nThese marks are well below those of devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Still, I didn't encounter a single instance of slowdown, whether I was browsing the internet, playing games, doing minor photo edits in Adobe's Lightroom CC, or watching the occasional video on YouTube.\nI didn't encounter a single instance of slowdown, whether I was browsing the internet, playing games, doing minor photo edits in Adobe's Lightroom CC, or watching the occasional video on YouTube.\nUnless you're the definition of a smartphone power user, you'll find very few issues with the Pixel 9 Pro's performance even if you're a big multi-tasker, thanks to its ample 16GB of RAM. Smartphone chips have been overkill for years, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL is no exception. Battery life lasts well into the late evening with moderate use, similar to my experience with the Pixel 9. Given that the Pixel 9 Pro XL features a larger 5,060 mAh cell versus the Pixel 9 Pro's 4,700 mAh, the latter device offers slightly better battery life.\nHow I use my Pixel 9's Screenshots app to remember everything\nThe Pixel 9 uses its on-device Gemini Nano model to analyze and catalog every screenshot you take. Here\u2019s how to use it best.\nPixel 9 Pro software\nAI coupled with a throwback to a simpler era of iOS\nOn the software side, Google's Pixel 9 Pro series supports all the same somewhat terrifying AI features as the Pixel 9, including \"Reimagine,\" which allows you to add nearly anything to an image with prompts, and Pixel Studio, Google's AI app that generates images. There\u2019s also Screenshots, an excellent app that uses AI to surface relevant screenshots, and more.\nReimagine's guardrails are pretty loose. With inventive prompts, you can easily trick it into creating off-putting images, and in some cases, these AI-edited photos look very convincing. Don't get me wrong, they're often ridiculous-looking and clearly fake, but that's not always the case (check out that picture below of a submarine in Lake Ontario). On the other hand, Pixel Studio is a silly AI image generator in line with Meta AI or OpenAI's DALL\u00b7E 3 that works reasonably well.\nMy key concern is that these images might be posted as reality without any obvious indication that they are AI-generated. It's a slippery slope we've been sliding down for months, and it's only a matter of time before these features reach other Android devices, making AI-altered and generated images even more common on social media.\nFor more on the Pixel 9 series' potential AI pitfalls and the serious implications Reimagine could have, check out my Pixel 9 review. It's worth mentioning that even in its early state, Gemini and its more conversational counterpart, Gemini Live (which is free for a year with the purchase of a Pixel 9 device and $20/month after), work shockingly well. Even though I have encountered the occasional glitch, I've never truly been able to have a conversation with an AI before Gemini/Gemini Live. Does talking to an AI assistant fit into my workflow, though? Not really, and I'm not sure it ever will.\nLastly, I'm a big fan of the Pixel's Android skin. It's simple, straightforward, and clean. In fact, I find it easier to navigate than iOS 18. Apple's mobile operating system has become increasingly complicated over the last few years, and Android 14 running on the Pixel 9 series has made that even more apparent (the update to Android 15 is coming soon). It's also great that Google has promised to provide seven years of software updates to the Pixel 9 line.\nApple Intelligence feels far away after Pixel 9's AI announcement\nGoogle's event may have been focused on the Pixel 9 and Pixel Watch 3, but its AI announcements showed how ahead the company is of the competition.\nShould you buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro?\nIt's one of Google's most complete smartphone packages in years\nMost people should opt for the standard Pixel 9, but if you're into photography, the Pixel 9 Pro series has a lot to offer. It captures my favorite smartphone photos yet, offering a more true-to-life balance that sits firmly between Samsung's intense saturation and Apple's increasingly inconsistent, out-there take on images and videos. This is in stark contrast to the various photo and video AI features offered by the Pixel 9 Pro series, including Zoom Enhance and Super Res Zoom Video, which I found particularly useful.\nOverall, the Pixel 9 Pro line offers one of Google's most complete smartphone packages in years, but if you're not an avid photographer, you can save a few hundred dollars and stick with the standard Pixel 9.\nThat said, I'm still concerned about Reimagine's broader implications, given how easy it is to use and how convincing the results can be sometimes. Additionally, I haven't found a way to integrate Gemini into my life, despite its impressive capabilities. Overall, the Pixel 9 Pro line offers one of Google's most complete smartphone packages in years, but if you're not an avid photographer, you can save a few hundred dollars and stick with the standard Pixel 9.\nThis device was provided to Pocket-lint by Google.\nPixel 9 Pro\n- Brand\n- SoC\n- Tensor G4\n- Display\n- 6.3-inch Super Actua display 1280 x 2856 pixel resolution OLED (1-120Hz)\n- RAM\n- 16GB\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n- Battery\n- 4700mAh, 24+ hours of battery life"

      "text": "Summary\n- Apple is reportedly overhauling its launch schedule for the iPhone 18, prioritizing the most expensive models.\n- It makes sense from a practical production perspective, as well as Apple's long-standing emphasis on \"premium\" customers.\n- That may leave some shoppers feeling left out, even if waiting a few months longer isn't a big deal in the end.\nIt's a sign of just how far ahead Apple needs to plan iPhone launches that we're already hearing rumors about the iPhone 18 -- months before the iPhone 17 is out. It's a lot of work finalizing a smartphone's design, in no small part because of the need to gauge the market, set priorities, and line up supply and manufacturing. All the more so when a lot of production needs to be moved out of China to cope with a trade war.\nFor the iPhone 18, however, Apple is reportedly shaking up its traditional schedule. The word from well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is that only Pro, Air/Slim, and foldable models will ship in fall 2026 -- if you want a standard 18, or an 18e, you'll have to wait until early 2027. If that's true, it's bound to upset a lot of people, although it makes unfortunate sense both on an immediate level and in terms of Apple's corporate philosophy.\nIs the iPhone 15 still worth buying in 2025? The answer is complicated\nPossibly, but you shouldn't get one straight from Apple.\nThe practical case for staggering the iPhone 18\nA tall order (quota)\nOn the surface, it seems ridiculous that special versions of the iPhone 18 would launch before the default model, never mind pushing the standard one into the following year. I agree with that sentiment, actually, but there is an underlying logic when you consider Apple's normal production patterns for the past several years. Since the iPhone 12, Apple has shipped four new models every fall, including Pro, Pro Max, and Plus/Mini form factors. That's a lot to deliver simultaneously, particularly since there aren't many other models to divert shoppers. Apple doesn't have the huge catalog of a company like Samsung -- if you don't want one of its fall phones, your only other choices are a lone budget/mid-range model (currently, the iPhone 16e) or last year's standard and Plus variants.\nFour phones is a lot to deliver simultaneously, particularly since there aren't many other models to divert shoppers.\nExcluding the 18 and 18e, Apple will still have four iPhones to deliver in 2026, including two particularly complicated products: the Air/Slim (I'll just call it the Air) and its first-ever foldable. The latter is a big deal, since Apple is expected to try and disrupt the foldable market with a new approach, for instance minimizing or completely eliminating screen creasing around the hinge. There are bound to be technical hurdles in producing the phone en masse. I'm calling it now, in fact -- for the first month or two, the foldable will probably be in extremely short supply. Its launch might even be delayed if the screen or hinge proves too fragile in pre-release testing.\nThe 18 Air won't be a first-generation product, given the iPhone 17 Air, but we're still talking about an ultra-slim device using advanced battery technology. Apple will need to refine the second generation, perhaps by improving battery life or making the chassis even thinner.\nTrying to deliver those two products alongside a Pro and Pro Max is going to be a challenge, even with Apple's global resources. But with all that said, there's probably a deeper motive for staggering things the way Kuo claims.\nWith the iPhone 16e, is Apple abandoning budget devices?\nSome upcoming hardware refreshes should confirm where Apple is headed.\nThe quiet part\nWhere Apple's priorities lie\nExecutives like Tim Cook rarely say so in public, but Apple's focus is on \"premium\" shoppers. The term sometimes comes up in relation to other tech companies, or luxury goods -- but in case it's not obvious, what Apple's really referring to is selling high-end electronics to people with a lot of disposable income. You'll certainly see college students, teenagers, and even young kids using Apple devices, but the company doesn't price most of its products for them. It'd much rather attract the person who can drop $1,000 without batting an eye, since that keeps profit margins up.\nPutting the most expensive models up front will ensure that they get the most hype, and that buyers wanting in on the latest iPhone generation won't have a cheaper option to be tempted by.\nThis priority is evident in Apple's existing product lineup. Typically, Pro iPhones aren't just slight upgrades -- they're fundamentally better, meant to nudge you up the price ladder. There's no telephoto lens at all on the standard iPhone 16, and Apple continues to reserve always-on displays with 120Hz refresh rates for Pros, despite the fact that cheaper Android phones have had those features for years. The standard iPhone 16 feels more like a scaled-back 16 Pro rather than the true baseline -- I was surprised when Apple deigned to give it a Camera Control button. Beyond that feature, many people are better off buying a used iPhone 15 Pro -- if they can find one. There's a reason Apple itself only carries the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus outside of refurbished models.\nAssuming Kuo is right, putting the iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max, Air, and foldable up front will ensure that they get the most hype, and that buyers wanting in on the latest iPhone generation won't have a cheaper option to be tempted by unless they have no choice, and/or they're willing to wait. Apple might even be able to capture some Christmas sales, although personally, I've never met anyone who bought their partner a Pro for the holidays, much less a $2,000-plus folding phone. Those people must be out there.\n4 things that happen immediately when you stop paying for iCloud+\nThere can be harsh consequences if you've come to depend on the extra storage.\nThe rest of us\nSome final thoughts\nI get the business case, but it's hard to shake the feeling that postponing the cheaper iPhone 18 models is somewhat disrespectful. Most people can't justify a $1,000 phone, after all -- the difference with a cheaper one is money that might be better spent on rent, groceries, education, or saving up for a house or car. Intended or not, the message seems to be that if you're not a high roller, you'll have to wait in line to get any of the latest tech, let alone the best.\nI do think Apple's priorities are worth pointing out, since they force us to think about the company's relationship to us, and vice versa.\nIs this a big deal, in the end? I suppose not. Waiting five or six months longer for a new iPhone isn't going to kill anyone. Some people, even those with a lot of cash, will hold onto a phone as long as possible on general principles. But I do think Apple's priorities are worth pointing out, since they force us to think about the company's relationship to us, and vice versa.\nEverything you need to know about PEVs, or personal electric vehicles\nYou can use PEVs to explore, run errands, or speed up your commute."
