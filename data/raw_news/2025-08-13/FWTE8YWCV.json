  "title": "'War of the Worlds' Isn\u2019t Just Bad. It\u2019s Also Shameless Tech Propaganda",
  "description": "By making Big Tech the hero in a movie about government surveillance, the dismally rated remake feels more like an ad for Amazon than anything else.",
  "content": "\u201cHere we go\u201d is both the first line of the 2025 Amazon Prime movie War of the Worlds and exactly what I said when I chose to watch it after the shitstorm of reviews that warned me not to.\n\nDirected by Rich Lee and shot exclusively through online calls and surveillance feed POVs, War of the Worlds centers around domestic terror analyst William Radford, played by Ice Cube, who is on a mission to save his family and the country from alien cyborgs who are deadset on eating our data. Literally.\n\nAt first glance, the film\u2019s three percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes\u2014up from zero percent when it debuted\u2014seems both impressive and predictable. While getting a rating below five percent seems like a difficult feat, remaking a classic (1953\u2019s The War of the Worlds has 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), is going to set some pretty high standards. Top that with setting an action film through the lens of Microsoft Teams meetings and poor CGI, and you\u2019re bound to make even the most tolerant viewer roll their eyes.\n\nBut graphics and clearance issues aside (I mean seriously, what was with all of the blurred out faces?), the tech-based plotholes that bordered on propaganda took away from the film\u2019s message on the importance of human connection. The most jarring examples are the inconsistencies of technological availability after the data-hungry aliens take out Earth\u2019s satellites. Military weapons, vehicle GPS systems, and Facebook page outages wreak physical and emotional havoc across the world, but somehow news networks, Starlink satellites, X feeds, and Amazon purchase access remain unscathed just a few scenes later with little-to-no explanation. Radford\u2019s office is locked when he tries to leave to save his daughter, but is somehow open when he has to hack the data servers in the basement\u2014after the building is put on an additional, air-sealed lockdown. Most ridiculously, a Prime Air drone is able to dodge through apocalyptic levels of destruction and mayhem to deliver a worldsaving thumbdrive to the DHS building.\n\nThe shameless promotion of tech brands doesn\u2019t end there. Radford\u2019s daughter, Faith, a Georgetown-educated biochemist, somehow has the bright idea of removing a large chunk of debris from her leg\u2014causing near-fatal bleeding. Thankfully, Mark Goodman, her Amazon delivery driver boyfriend, is able to make a tourniquet out of packaging tape because, according to him, he\u2019s a \u201cpro.\u201d Even minor characters get caught up in the \u201cAmazon Savior\u201d motif. When the worldsaving Amazon Prime Air drone overturns on the way to the DHS building, a houseless person only helps to fix it after being rewarded with a $1,000 Amazon gift card.\n\nThese scenes in War of the Worlds would have been just outrageous enough to be chalked up to comedy, if it wasn\u2019t for the film's heightened focus on government surveillance without any mention of the tech industry\u2019s role in all this. From Anonymous-style livestreams featuring the US constitution, to Radford digitally stalking his children, and the secret data-stealing project that beacons the aliens to Earth, the true enemy is clear: the US government and its technology. In fact, the only time privacy is threatened as it relates to private businesses is when the government interferes with it. For example, Radford uses Guardian, the government\u2019s surveillance software system, to hack into a Tesla, and remotely take his hurt daughter to a safer location. In the beginning of the film, David, Radford\u2019s son, insults his father by saying his career consists of nothing more than spying on people's Amazon shopping carts. Most importantly, the secret government program Goliath, which is the ultimate reason why the alien cyborgs invaded, cyphons billions of dollars worth of private data conversations from the American people. There is zero mention of tech juggernauts like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk being linked to controversial data collection processes, from failing to protect personal data to staging a full blown digital coup in the US government. Hardly surprising, considering it's an Amazon movie, but it still feels like a glaring omission.\n\nIf I had to say something nice about War of the Worlds, Lee took a risk remaking a beloved thriller through an internet-first POV. While risks can pay off\u2014this didn't. The decision to demonize government surveillance while making Big Tech the passive victims ultimately water down the film\u2019s message\u2014making it more of a near-90 minute commercial for brands like Amazon and Microsoft than food for thought. But hey, maybe all this promo means Amazon Air will finally be available in Washington, DC, at least.",

      "text": "On September 26, 2018, a row of tech executives filed into a marble- and wood-paneled hearing room and sat down behind a row of tabletop microphones and tiny water bottles. They had all been called to testify before the US Senate Commerce Committee on a dry subject\u2014the safekeeping and privacy of customer data\u2014that had recently been making large numbers of people mad as hell.\nCommittee chair John Thune, of South Dakota, gaveled the hearing to order, then began listing events from the past year that had shown how an economy built on data can go luridly wrong. It had been 12 months since the news broke that an eminently preventable breach at the credit agency Equifax had claimed the names, social security numbers, and other sensitive credentials of more than 145 million Americans. And it had been six months since Facebook was engulfed in scandal over Cambridge Analytica, a political intelligence firm that had managed to harvest private information from up to 87 million Facebook users for a seemingly Bond-villainesque psychographic scheme to help put Donald Trump in the White House.\nTo prevent abuses like these, the European Union and the state of California had both passed sweeping new data privacy regulations. Now Congress, Thune said, was poised to write regulations of its own. \u201cThe question is no longer whether we need a federal law to protect consumers' privacy,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe question is, what shape will that law take?\u201d Sitting in front of the senator, ready to help answer that question, were representatives from two telecom firms, Apple, Google, Twitter, and Amazon.\nNotably absent from the lineup was anyone from Facebook or Equifax, which had been grilled by Congress separately. So for the assembled execs, the hearing marked an opportunity to start lobbying for friendly regulations\u2014and to assure Congress that, of course, their companies had the issue completely under control.\nNo executive at the hearing projected quite as much aloof confidence on this count as Andrew DeVore, the representative from Amazon, a company that rarely testifies before Congress. After the briefest of greetings, he began his opening remarks by quoting one of his company's core maxims to the senators: \u201cAmazon's mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company.\u201d It was a stock line, but it made the associate general counsel sound a bit like he was speaking as an emissary from a larger and more important planet.\nDeVore, a former prosecutor with rugged features, made clear that what Amazon needed most from lawmakers was minimal interference. Consumer trust was already Amazon's highest priority, and a commitment to privacy and data security was sewn into everything the company did. \u201cWe design our products and services so that it's easy for customers to understand when their data is being collected and control when it's shared,\u201d he said. \u201cOur customers trust us to handle their data carefully and sensibly.\u201d\nOn this last point, DeVore was probably making a safe assumption. That year, a study by Georgetown University found Amazon to be the second-most-trusted institution in the United States, after the military. But as companies like Facebook have learned in recent years, public trust can be fragile. And in hindsight, what's most interesting about Amazon's 2018 testimony is what DeVore did not say.\nAt that very moment inside Amazon, the division charged with keeping customer data safe for the company's retail operation was in a state of turmoil: understaffed, demoralized, worn down from frequent changes in leadership, and\u2014by its own leaders' accounts\u2014severely handicapped in its ability to do its job. That year and the one before it, the team had been warning Amazon's executives that the retailer's information was at risk. And the company's own practices were fanning the danger.\nAccording to internal documents reviewed by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and WIRED, Amazon's vast empire of customer data\u2014its metastasizing record of what you search for, what you buy, what shows you watch, what pills you take, what you say to Alexa, and who's at your front door\u2014had become so sprawling, fragmented, and promiscuously shared within the company that the security division couldn't even map all of it, much less adequately defend its borders.\nIn the name of speedy customer service, unbridled growth, and rapid-fire \u201cinvention on behalf of customers\u201d\u2014in the name of delighting you\u2014Amazon had given broad swathes of its global workforce extraordinary latitude to tap into customer data at will. It was, as former Amazon chief information security officer Gary Gagnon calls it, a \u201cfree-for-all\u201d of internal access to customer information. And as information security leaders warned, that free-for-all left the company wide open to \u201cinternal threat actors\u201d while simultaneously making it inordinately difficult to track where all of Amazon's data was flowing.\nTo be clear: This story is not about Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing wing that manages data for millions of enterprises and government agencies, which has its own, separate information security apparatus. It's about the online retail platform used by hundreds of millions of ordinary consumers. And on that side of Amazon's business, InfoSec staffers warned of an unnerving \u201cinability to detect security incidents.\u201d\nBy the time DeVore started testifying about Amazon's long-standing commitment to privacy and security, the dangers that the security division had identified weren't just theoretical. According to Reveal and WIRED's findings, they were real, and they were pervasive. Across Amazon, some low-level employees were using their data privileges to snoop on the purchases of celebrities, while others were taking bribes to help shady sellers sabotage competitors' businesses, doctor Amazon's review system, and sell knock-off products to unsuspecting customers. Millions of credit card numbers had sat in the wrong place on Amazon's internal network for years, with the security team unable to establish definitively whether they'd been unduly accessed. And a program that allowed sellers to extract their own metrics had become a backdoor for third-party developers to amass Amazon customer data. In fact, not long before September's hearing, Amazon had discovered that a Chinese data firm had been harvesting millions of customers' information in a scheme reminiscent of Cambridge Analytica.\nAmazon had thieves in its house and sensitive data streaming out beyond its walls. But DeVore\u2014who had himself received a report that year warning that far too many Amazonians had access to insecurely stored passwords, and who had aggressively shot down a company lawyer for questioning Amazon's reputation on customer privacy\u2014didn't reveal any of that to the senators.\nFew corporations make a fetish of their own precepts and rituals quite the way Amazon does.\nJeff Bezos' famous leadership principles\u2014handed out to employees on laminated cards, posted on the walls, recited verbatim\u2014instruct Amazonians to show a \u201cbias for action\u201d because \u201cspeed matters in business\u201d (Principle No. 9). They preach \u201cfrugality\u201d because \u201cconstraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention\u201d (No. 10). Above all, they hold that Amazon's leaders should \u201cobsess over customers\u201d (No. 1). In the company's early days, Bezos instituted what he called the two-pizza rule: \u201cNo team should be so large that it cannot be fed with just two pizzas.\u201d No matter how huge Amazon becomes, the thinking went, it should be able to keep functioning like a bunch of small, flinty startups\u2014albeit ones with instant, unmediated access to the corporation's world-beating data and logistics. That way, Amazon would remain a vibrant place where, to quote another verse of corporate scripture, it is \u201calways day one.\u201d\nAnother commandment that Bezos laid down in the company's early years was a ban on PowerPoint presentations, arguing that they encouraged shallow, distracted thinking. Instead, he ruled that Amazonians should present their reports to executives in the form of meaty, single-spaced memos\u2014called six-pagers\u2014to be read carefully and silently at the beginning of a meeting by all in attendance.\nOver the past several months, Reveal and WIRED reviewed some of the confidential six-pagers that Amazon's information security chiefs prepared for submission to Jeff Wilke, then the CEO of Amazon's global consumer operation, along with general counsel David Zapolsky and chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky, between 2016 and 2018. This account is based partly on those memos, along with numerous other internal Amazon documents and communications dating back to 2015, as well as interviews with more than a dozen former Amazon data security and privacy staffers, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation, reputational damage, or legal threats for speaking openly.\nTaken together, these sources show that Amazon's data security problems kept amassing through 2018 as the company grew. They also reveal that, in many ways, the division's overwhelming challenges grew out of the very cultural precepts that Amazon holds dear\u2014and out of the world-devouring growth they helped to foster.\nIn an emailed statement, Amazon spokesperson Jen Bemisderfer said the company has \u201can exceptional track record of protecting customer data,\u201d and indicated that these internal documents were a sign of its strong culture. \u201cThe fact that Amazon's privacy and security issues are extensively documented with extensive review from senior leadership highlights our commitment to these issues and demonstrates the vigilance with which we identify, escalate, and respond to potential risks,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe've invested billions of dollars over the years to build systems and processes to keep data secure, and are constantly looking for ways to improve.\u201d\nFor two decades of its early history, Amazon, like a lot of companies, outsourced the storage of its data to a third-party contractor, Oracle. But by the mid-2010s, Amazon's data warehouse there had ballooned to become the biggest Oracle database in the world\u2014as much as 1,000 times bigger than any other, according to one Amazon estimate. It held a staggering 50,000 terabytes of information.\nAt Amazon, 3,300 small teams\u2014which were represented in one internal map as a celestial orb comprising so many points of light\u2014were tapping into that data every day, all hungry for their own analytics. They had a tendency to grab the data they needed, copy it, and store it elsewhere, according to a 2018 security memo that analyzed the roots of the company's data risks. The result: a \u201cmostly undocumented proliferation of copies of their required data sets.\u201d\nThat rapid and furious proliferation was, in part, what made it nearly impossible for the information security division to get a handle on Amazon's data. \u201cThe increasing number of copies of data sets, combined with Amazon's decentralized accountability and ownership model,\u201d the memo said, saddled the security division with a Sisyphean task. In 2016, in fact, the security team attempted to map all of Amazon's data\u2014and was not able to do so.\nBy then, Amazon had embarked on a massive, multiyear effort to transfer its Oracle-based data to a new internal system, housed on Amazon Web Services' own servers. (At one point, the guy in charge of that transition\u2014a data warehousing expert named Jeff Carter\u2014described his job in a public presentation by showing a photo of a few men changing the tires of a car tilted precariously on two wheels as it sped down the road.) But there was still data scattered in the wind, untagged, unmapped, untracked.\nAt the same time, a different stratum of Amazon's empire presented another set of unruly vulnerabilities. Around the world, thousands of Amazon customer service representatives sat in rows of cubicles in call centers or at computers in their own homes. To ensure that they could help customers as quickly as possible, the company gave them the ability to look up nearly anyone's purchase history on command. One former service rep, who requested anonymity, said he remembered colleagues looking up the purchases of Kanye West and movie stars from the Avengers films, even scoping out a few dildos in a particular celebrity's purchase log. Other staffers recalled coworkers looking up exes and girlfriends or boyfriends. \u201cEverybody, everybody did it,\u201d a former customer service manager says. They weren't supposed to, of course. Amazon repeatedly made that clear. In a statement, Amazon's Bemisderfer wrote, \u201cWe strongly reject the notion that abuse of these privileges is \u2018common.\u2019\u201d But the tools were right there; agents could start a \u201cresearch session\u201d to look up a customer who wasn't on the phone, then just type in a name.\nAs early as 2015, executives knew that employees' broad access privileges were a problem at Amazon. But voyeuristic curiosity was the least of their worries. That year, an internal audit, first reported by Politico EU, found that tens of thousands of employees had the ability to \u201cspoof\u201d a seller account\u2014with many of them possessing access to secret keys that allowed them to issue refunds and view customer order histories as if they were the vendor. And according to the auditors' conclusions, 23,000 of them shouldn't have been granted all those powers. Amazon told Politico that, like any company, it audits its policies for compliance and makes improvements based on these findings. But a 2010 audit had arrived at similar conclusions, and the problems had persisted.\nAmazon's system, a much later memo would say, \u201callows associates to quickly work on behalf of Amazon customers, but puts those same customers at risk from intentional abuse and unintentional exposure by employees and contractors who have been entrusted with elevated privileges.\u201d\nBut in some ways, one of Amazon's most knotty sources of vulnerability was the information security division itself\u2014and how ill-equipped, dysfunctional, and adrift it was, even as dedicated security staffers performed heroic feats against tall odds. In March 2016, the division's longtime chief, George Stathakopoulos, left for a job at Apple, which sent the team into several months of limbo. But the division's bouts of turmoil would go deeper and last much longer than that.\nAround the tail end of 2016, a guy named Gary Gagnon\u2014a cybersecurity executive with decades of experience, primarily in federal government work\u2014flew to Seattle to discuss becoming Amazon's new vice president of information security. His last interview of the day was with Wilke, the consumer CEO, who met Gagnon in a small conference room off of his modest office, dressed in a flannel button-down and jeans. The outfit was part of a tradition, Gagnon recalls Wilke explaining: He always dressed like a warehouse worker during the peak holiday shopping season, to remind folks at headquarters of the people who really kept Amazon churning.\nGagnon wasn't that eager for a new job, he says, but he was blown away by Wilke, and how humble he seemed for someone who commanded the largest online retail operation on earth. \u201cOK,\u201d Gagnon remembers thinking, \u201cthis is a guy I can work for.\u201d\nEverything went downhill from there. At an all-hands meeting in the beginning of 2017, Wilke introduced Gagnon as the security division's new leader, shocking some staffers who had been expecting the acting chief, a longtime insider, to get the job. When Gagnon gave his first speech to his team, his frequent use of the prefix \u201ccyber-\u201d instantly grated on some in the division, who regarded it as the tic of an East Coast government type. \u201cIt became a joke from day one,\u201d says one former manager. Gagnon says a staffer later pulled him aside and duly advised him to lay off the term \u201ccybersecurity.\u201d\nAs he settled into his new role, Gagnon quickly realized that all was not well with \u201cinformation security\u201d\u2014as he was urged to call it\u2014at Amazon. The size of the company's network was astounding, but \u201cit was all put together with tape and bubblegum,\u201d a tangle of old and new software, Gagnon says. \u201cIt grew up out of a garage and it just kept going from there.\u201d New consumer products were locked down with the utmost secrecy before launch, Gagnon says. But otherwise it seemed like everyone on the network had access to nearly everything, including customer information\u2014and yet there was no insider threat program dedicated to preventing rogue employees from abusing their access while he was there. More fundamentally, he says, the team didn't seem to have any systematic way of prioritizing its biggest security risks. \u201cIt was shocking to me,\u201d Gagnon says.\nHe inherited a team of 300-odd people but thought it should have probably been more like 1,000. But when he tried to beef up his staff, Gagnon soon found out that the frugality he'd admired in Wilke was going to pose a problem for him: Upon asking for more resources, he says, the consumer CEO usually turned him down. (Wilke could not be reached for comment.)\nThe division, Gagnon came to believe, was essentially dead weight in Wilke's profit-and-loss calculation. The information security team over at Amazon Web Services actually generated revenue with products for the cloud division's enterprise customers. But on Wilke's consumer side of the business, Gagnon says, InfoSec was seen as another overhead cost, one that cut into other projects that made Amazon faster, more profitable, and more pleasurable. \u201cThe philosophy at Amazon was about customer experience. They wanted to delight the customer,\u201d Gagnon says. \u201cAnd that was at the expense of everything else.\u201d\nAmazon says it \u201cwill never sacrifice security for costs.\u201d But in Gagnon's view, investment in information security was spare: \u201cThe budgets didn't align with the needs.\u201d Some former security staffers echo him on this sense of austerity in the division. \u201cI would tell new hires, \u2018Assume your budget is zero and go from there. Just be as frugal as you can,\u2019\u201d says Ellie Havens, a former business operations manager on the security team.\nIn an August 2017 six-pager to Wilke, Gagnon outlined a host of risks that stemmed from Amazon's breakneck growth and his security team's thin resources. New devices connected to Amazon's system were continually being discovered without a centralized system that tracked them all; new fulfillment centers were going up like gangbusters, with warehouse computer security \u201cfailing to keep pace\u201d; and payment processing was being expanded to multiple new countries every year, with the security team struggling to keep up.\nIn the midst of all that expansion, Gagnon wrote, breathtaking things were slipping through the cracks. Just that May, staffers had discovered that, for a period of two years, the names and American Express card numbers of up to 24 million customers had sat exposed on Amazon's internal network, outside a \u201csecure zone\u201d for payment data. It was as if a bank had realized that some sacks of cash had been left in a back office, outside the vault, for several seasons. The exposure was corrected, but the scariest part was that there was no way to be sure whether anyone had snooped on the payment credentials during all that time\u2014because the data set's access logs only went back 90 days. \u201cSo we had no idea what the exposure actually was,\u201d Gagnon remembers. \u201cI was astonished by that.\u201d (Bemisderfer says, \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest the data was ever exposed outside of our internal system in any way.\u201d)\nA more fundamental problem facing Amazon, as Gagnon sized it up in his memo, was this: \u201cWe lack visibility into the data we are charged with protecting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe do not systemically know the data flows and storage locations of sensitive data.\u201d\nIn security terms, the implication was obvious: If the team didn't know where all the data was, how could they make sure it wasn't leaked, stolen, or manipulated inappropriately? But Gagnon also saw another giant hazard on the horizon. In April 2016 the European Parliament had passed the General Data Protection Regulation, a sweeping consumer privacy law that would go into effect in 2018. After that, firms operating in Europe would be allowed to use people's data under a stringent set of conditions, and sometimes only with their consent. Companies would also be required to make it possible for customers to have their data deleted. \u201cI don't know how the hell we're going to deal with that,\u201d Gagnon remembers thinking, \u201cbecause we have no idea where our fucking data is.\u201d\nBut these kinds of privacy concerns didn't seem to be high on the company's list of priorities either. When Gagnon went to David Treadwell, the vice president in charge of Amazon's retail technical infrastructure, to ask how the company was going to handle getting itself into compliance with GDPR, Treadwell's reply, according to Gagnon, was: \u201cWhat's GDPR?\u201d Gagnon says he was later told not to worry, that the company had hired lawyers to get Amazon ready for the law. \u201cWhen I brought this up, one of the lawyers from the legal department came into my office and told me to completely back down,\u201d he says.\nIt wasn't that executives like Wilke didn't care about keeping customer data safe, Gagnon says. \u201cThey did what they thought was enough,\u201d he says. \u201cThey're making a ton of money. Their stock is going up ... They had no indications that any of the cyber stuff was going to affect their business.\u201d Or at least, it hadn't yet.\nIn June 2017, at a giddy town hall meeting led by executives from two major American corporations, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey announced that after a \u201cwhirlwind courtship\u201d Amazon had decided to purchase the upscale grocer for $13.7 billion. He described how, in just a matter of weeks, the two companies had gone from their first \u201cblind date\u201d to becoming \u201cofficially engaged.\u201d Looking back at the executives' first meeting together, Mackey joked that \u201cit was truly love at first sight.\u201d\nThe security team at Amazon, which had repeatedly warned of the risks posed by constantly gobbling up new subsidiaries and folding them into the company's network, was less smitten. Less than a week after the shotgun wedding was finalized, an analyst at the credit card processing company First Data called an Amazon employee with an ominous tip. A Ukrainian broker had just put some credit card data for sale on the dark web that could indicate a breach at Whole Foods.\nAmazon's security division jumped into action, alerting Whole Foods and launching an investigation. Over the next few weeks, the team determined that a notorious group of Ukrainian cybercriminals had been inside parts of the Whole Foods corporate network since January. The attackers had control of 20 employee accounts with powerful levels of access. They had burrowed so deep that the Whole Foods team working on the breach had to be moved to an entirely different email system to communicate without fear of the hackers snooping, according to an internal memo.\nOnce the security division kicked out the attackers, Amazon notified customers that hackers had made off with credit card details for purchases made at some restaurants and taprooms inside the grocery chain's stores. The hackers hadn't made the jump from Whole Foods into the larger Amazon network, but it still wasn't a good look. The breach made headlines.\nWith customer loyalty and trust at stake, the breach might have supplied an opportunity for Gagnon to make the case for more investment in security. But he wouldn't be sticking around much longer. In October 2017, just a month after the Whole Foods breach, Gagnon and a slew of other staffers flew to London for ZonCon, Amazon's invite-only information security conference, an event for team building and recruiting. Gagnon didn't make it through the conference.\nHis fate was sealed one night at a private dinner for the event's speakers. Precisely what happened there is under dispute, but Gagnon never returned to work for Amazon. The next day, he says, he was pulled into a video call with Treadwell back in Seattle, who told him to leave the conference and fly home. When he got back to the States, Gagnon says, he was told that what happened in London was \u201cinexcusable\u201d without receiving any additional detail. He was fired the following week, the company confirmed.\nWhatever really took place, the upshot for the division was more instability. \u201cWe went back to Lord of the Flies,\u201d says a former Amazon security manager. \u201cIt was just a shit show.\u201d The team was leaderless again after less than a year. With chaos at the top, other senior staffers and managers would leave too, leaving the group unsettled and lacking institutional memory. Projects got derailed, and security would lose its top advocate in high-level meetings, former staffers say. The division's teams would hunker down in silos, sometimes fighting among themselves and operating without a strategic vision. As the search dragged on, some staffers began to wonder why it was so hard to find a new chief. \u201cWe couldn't find anybody for the longest time,\u201d says Havens. \u201cI think word had gotten out that it wasn't an easy place to work in security.\u201d\nFinally, Amazon moved another leader into the top information security role\u2014someone who had at least proven himself inside the company. The division's new chief was Jeff Carter, the guy who had orchestrated Amazon's monumental data migration from Oracle to Amazon Web Services. But there was a hitch: Carter didn't have experience in data security. As he himself would later joke in a presentation, viewable on YouTube, his reaction to the job offer was to say, \u201cUh, this doesn't seem like an entry-level job for a security person.\u201d\nIt wasn't. Around the time Carter arrived, a set of managers inside the information security division got together to quantify their alarm over the biggest dangers Amazon was facing. Each danger was assigned three scores: One for how badly it could affect the company, one for how likely it was to happen, and one for what power Amazon had to control it. Then those three numbers were multiplied together for a total risk score.\nAtop the security team's list was the danger that breaches would \u201cgo unnoticed\u201d due to \u201climited detections, alert fatigue, and manual effort.\u201d The impact of such a scenario, the managers determined, could be \u201ccritical\u201d (5 out of 5), its probability was \u201cvery likely\u201d (5 out of 5), and the team had \u201cno controls\u201d against the company's exposure to it (5 out of 5). Total risk score: 125 out of 125.\nNext up, the managers evaluated the danger that \u201clack of visibility into systems and networks\u201d would create an \u201cinability to detect security incidents.\u201d Risk score: 125 out of 125. Then there was Amazon's \u201cinability\u201d to protect secret credentials and keys that could unlock sensitive data: 125 out of 125. Then came Amazon's \u201cinability to identify the location of data.\u201d 125 out of 125 again.\nAmazon says these risks were \u201coverstated.\u201d But around that same time, yet another dire-sounding message issued from a unit inside the security division called the Security Operations Center, which was responsible for detecting and responding to attacks. A memo from the team warned that, because the group relied on humans to report problems when they came upon them instead of having an effective automated system to proactively search for evidence of a breach, an attacker could conceivably hide out in Amazon's network for years without being noticed.\nAmazon claims this memo ignored \u201cmultiple compensating controls and fallback measures\u201d that the company had in place to prevent intruders. Still, the document's urgency was palpable: \u201cWe can't scale with people, there are just not enough so we must scale with automation.\u201d But automation, the memo went on, was \u201ccurrently underfunded.\u201d\nAs Carter settled into his new job, in short, the alarms sounding within the information security division were cranked up as high as they could go. Elsewhere in the company, meanwhile, another group of staffers had been boiling over with their own concerns about Amazon's handling of customer data.\nGary Gagnon wasn't the only one who blanched at the thought of preparing the company to comply with Europe's GDPR. At a time when the world was growing increasingly concerned about tech companies' use of personal data\u2014not just whether they kept it safe from cybercriminals, but how they themselves passed it around and milked it for profit\u2014Amazon had only a small handful of employees who were officially charged with ensuring customer privacy across the organization. Most of them were clustered in the company's legal department under associate general counsel Bill Way. And throughout 2017 they struggled to advocate for privacy in a company that hated to slow down, where executives often seemed not to appreciate their efforts.\nIn May 2017, a senior engineer among this small group of staffers sent an email to Way sketching the general lay of the land: Addressing privacy issues around the company had become \u201ca brutal game of whack-a-mole,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI've had several conversations with internal employees that were not happy with the transparency and privacy practices of tools they were developing, but attempts to fix this were knocked down by leadership,\u201d the engineer wrote. \u201cOf course, these individuals have to take their career into account before fighting against their reporting chain too much on those issues, and it points to the need for a centralized privacy team to handle those escalations and battles.\u201d\nOther tech giants, the engineer wrote, had more mature systems in place for working through complex privacy issues, and Amazon was falling behind. (Google, for instance, had scores of employees working on privacy.) \u201cWithout a privacy development team to own that work,\u201d he concluded, \u201cI'm not sure we are well positioned to catch up.\u201d\nIn the fall of 2017, a different staffer\u2014an Amazon compliance expert\u2014wrote a memo to Way and others warning that the company could face multibillion-dollar fines over privacy issues if it didn't shape up. The memo argued that Amazon should aim to have more than 30 dedicated privacy staffers instead of just a handful, and said the company offered few to no resources for privacy training, the development of products for privacy, or data mapping. (That staffer later alleged that he was pushed out of the company in part for raising these issues, according to records reviewed by WIRED and Reveal. Politico EU also reported on allegations that the company punished staffers for raising security concerns. \u201cEmployees did not face retaliation,\u201d Amazon says. \u201cNo employees left the company because they had raised concerns around data security regulation compliance.\u201d)\nLater that year, when members of Amazon's legal team tried to help the company up its privacy game, their efforts, too, were shot down. That December, a company lawyer polled a group of colleagues on whether Amazon should join the International Association of Privacy Professionals. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Oracle, and Salesforce had already become corporate members, giving hundreds of their employees access to its resources. A top-tier corporate membership cost $25,000.\n\u201cIt's a relatively cheap way for the company to keep our privacy professionals connected into that network and to show that the company is sensitive to and thoughtful about privacy issues generally, instead of being mostly conspicuous by our absence,\u201d wrote a Japan-based Amazon lawyer in the thread.\nBut Andrew DeVore\u2014the associate general counsel who would ultimately testify before Congress about Amazon's \u201clong-standing commitment to privacy and data security,\u201d and the most senior person on the chain\u2014batted the idea away: \u201cI don't think it's a particularly useful forum for us to achieve any broader privacy objectives.\u201d\nOther lawyers tried to argue back, but it didn't go well. \u201cIt is a very uncomfortable situation to be present at IAPP events as a private member,\u201d wrote an Amazon attorney based in Germany, \u201cwhile it is clear that I am working for a company that is perceived as not being interested in privacy issues.\u201d\nThat set DeVore off.\n\u201cAnyone\u2014and in particular anyone who purports to have any real involvement in or understanding of privacy issues\u2014who believes Amazon is \u2018not interested in privacy issues\u2019 is a complete and utter ignoramus,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe wouldn't be here, and we would not have the incredible array of privacy protective products and services that we make available around the world, if we weren't absolutely privacy obsessed in all we do. We have been from day one, and it [is] still day one. So I hope, and fully expect, that all of you push back hard on that kind of crap.\u201d\nAmazon didn't join the privacy organization. Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing wing, later did. One former Amazon lawyer who worked on getting the company ready for GDPR argues that DeVore's contention that the company designed its products with privacy in mind is simply inaccurate. At the time, \u201cAmazon didn't have meaningful controls to limit access and sharing of user personal data, including sensitive data, within the company,\u201d the lawyer says. \u201cWithin Amazon, user personal data flowed like a river.\u201d\nAs the May 2018 deadline for complying with GDPR drew closer, the issue of data privacy surged to the forefront of public attention\u2014courtesy of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which erupted that March. Suddenly morning news shows and nighttime comedy hosts were chewing over a convoluted story about a third-party developer who took liberties with data freely acquired through Facebook's application programming interface. In a matter of days, Facebook's market cap dropped by more than $35 billion.\nInside Amazon, privacy staffers feared their company could careen into its own submerged iceberg of a privacy scandal. After all, Amazon wasn't even doing much to steer clear of the giant glacial mass that was looming right in front of it: Europe's new privacy regime, which threatened fines in the many millions of dollars. Finally, with only five weeks before the May 25, 2018, enforcement deadline, \u201cthe decision was made\u201d to create a privacy team to help prepare the world's largest online retailer for the new law, according to a July 2018 information security memo.\nAmazon says that it has always had privacy staffers distributed across the company, that it \u201cbegan planning for GDPR years in advance\u201d and simply opted to centralize its efforts in the run-up to the deadline. But months later, in front of the Senate Commerce Committee, DeVore still seemed miffed that the European law had distracted Amazon from its customer-centric priorities. \u201cOur long-standing commitment to privacy aligned us well with the principles of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation,\u201d DeVore said. \u201cMeeting its specific requirements for the handling, retention, and deletion of personal data required us to divert significant resources to administrative tasks\u2014and away from invention on behalf of customers.\u201d\nConsidering DeVore's testimony, Gary Gagnon has a hard time stomaching the claim that Amazon was well-aligned with GDPR and had privacy at its core. \u201cIt's all bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cComplete bullshit.\u201d\nIn the spring and summer of 2018, Amazon looked like an unstoppable force with a brick on its accelerator. The company had over 575,000 global employees. Jeff Bezos had been declared the world's richest man, and Amazon was on the verge of becoming the world's second company, after Apple, to reach a value of $1 trillion. As Bezos reported in his annual shareholder letter that April, more than 100 million people around the world had become Prime members, and they were going bonkers for smart devices like Echo Dots and Fire TV Sticks\u2014products that turned their daily lives into ever more Amazon data points.\nIt was at this moment of relative triumph that a dam seemed to break. In a rush, the vulnerabilities that Amazon's security division had been flagging were manifesting in a series of gut-wrenching discoveries.\nOne day in late May, Amazon's risk intelligence team stumbled on a sketchy-looking service that was being offered to Amazon's third-party sellers\u2014a business scheme that harvested Amazon data in ways that were, in some respects, evocative of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica debacle. Called AMZReview, the service advertised itself as a way to help sellers boost their rankings on the Amazon platform, and it claimed to possess detailed information on millions of Amazon customers. As the team investigated, they discovered a disturbing truth about how the folks at AMZReview had gotten their hands on all that customer data: Amazon had let them have it, according to a draft of a memo that detailed the team's findings.\nAmazon's retail platform had long offered sellers a convenient program that allowed them to pull data about their customers. All they needed was a special key to tap into Amazon's interface, and they could unlock access to customers' information, including names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, the products they'd ordered, and the dates when they'd ordered them. The idea was that sellers could use all that data to manage their businesses, possibly by hiring their own software developers to build analytics tools.\nThe problem was that third-party companies, hungry for data to monetize, had realized they could collect the keys from many different sellers and amass huge pools of customer information without customers' knowledge. This door had been wide open for years, with companies gaining easy access to Amazon customer data, until the intel team discovered AMZReview.\nIn exchange for access to all the customer data that Amazon provided, AMZReview offered to help sellers attain a crucial piece of information that Amazon strictly withheld: the personal email addresses attached to customers and their reviews. Bad reviews can sink a business on Amazon, but with the right email addresses, sellers could induce dissatisfied customers to take their reviews down, or entice people to leave good ones with special offers.\nHow did AMZReview know those email addresses? The service, Amazon determined, was an offshoot of a Chinese analytics firm called TouchData, and it seemed to have obtained the customer emails from \u201cother open and breached sources\u201d of data on the internet. From there, it had ways of matching addresses to Amazon reviews, with a modest success rate. In all, AMZReview obtained access keys from 92 different sellers, allowing it to pull all of their customer information from Amazon's system. It claimed to have information on 16 million Amazon customers. (The intel team said it was able to verify only that AMZReview had likely harvested the information of 4.8 million. TouchData denies that it was ever connected to AMZReview, which is no longer active.)\nWhen the risk intel team first reported the discovery up the chain, \u201cthe color was draining from people's faces,\u201d says one person involved in the meetings. \u201cIt was a fucking shitstorm.\u201d\nThe problem was far bigger than just AMZReview, which was only one player among many that could harvest data from the information Amazon gave to sellers. Merchants accessed billions of customer orders through Amazon's interface with little oversight. The largest third-party developer had access to a billion orders. Sure, there were rules for how sellers and developers were supposed to use the system. But it appeared, the memo said, that more than half of the third-party developers the company had researched were violating Amazon's terms of service. A former staffer familiar with the details says that most were probably legitimate businesses. But still, the former employee adds, \u201cthere was a massive hole. It was really unmitigated.\u201d\nThe memo said Amazon had been \u201coversharing\u201d customer details, handing out many different kinds of data points, often without regard to what sellers actually needed. And Amazon had \u201cno way of knowing,\u201d the memo said, if the data was being accessed by actual sellers or by third-party companies who were doing who knows what with it. The companies could be selling the data outright or using it to create targeted marketing aimed at Amazon customers. \u201cWe believe such use could violate customer trust if customers understood what was happening,\u201d it said.\nAmazon's leaders wanted the problem solved, and fast. The memo set forth a plan: Amazon would limit the data shared with sellers. It would regularly audit the companies that were pulling data to catch any misconduct. As for the massive amount of data that had already leaked out, they decided to simply ask the biggest companies to please get rid of their historical data on Amazon customers. Amazon says it used external audits to make sure the data was trashed.\n\u201cThe biggest concern was just optics,\u201d says a former Amazon employee who had knowledge of the situation. \u201cIf it had come out that that was happening? All that embarrassing shit that you ordered on Amazon, there's some Chinese company that could pin down the date you bought it? Obviously they wouldn't want anyone to know about that.\u201d\nSome people involved couldn't help but think of the still-broiling Cambridge Analytica scandal. But while Facebook got publicly barbecued, Amazon dealt with AMZReview quietly. Some privacy advocates say the company should have come clean. \u201cThey should have said, \u2018Here's what is going on, here's what we did to fix it, and here's what we know about who got their hands on your data,\u2019\u201d says Bennett Cyphers, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nAmazon says there's nothing to see here. \u201cThere was not a data leak,\u201d says company spokesperson Jen Bemisderfer. \u201cWe have strict policies and contractual terms in place that prohibit the misuse of customer data by sellers and service providers, and we continuously monitor and audit our systems to detect misuse and enforce our policies.\u201d When Amazon discovered companies abusing their access, it cut them off, she says. Amazon also invested in an outside auditor to make sure companies comply. As for how many customers had their information shoveled up by companies misusing the system, Amazon had \u201cno response.\u201d\nAs bad as it was, AMZReview wasn't the only problem the company discovered that May. At almost exactly the same time, Amazon's security division learned that several Amazon accounts belonging to employees in China had been used to bypass controls in the company's customer service platform. According to an internal memo, those accounts had then changed the email addresses attached to some 36,000 customer profiles, a move that would have allowed the attackers to take over the customer accounts and use them for fraud. Eight employees, including an IT engineer, were potentially involved and appeared to be in league with Chinese companies that provide services to Amazon sellers. Several employees were fired, according to the memo, and a technology team corrected the vulnerability that had been used to change email addresses within days of its discovery.\nThe security division also learned that someone inside Amazon's system had logged in to 6,581 customer accounts and deleted reviews they'd written. The two incidents appeared related. Someone was gaming one of the world's biggest marketplaces, and they had inside help.\nWhen Jeff Carter\u2014the new security chief who didn't have security experience\u2014was ready to submit his first quarterly six-pager to senior execs in July 2018, he started by capturing the still-bedraggled state of the security division. \u201cThrough various management transitions, there has been a breakdown in trust amongst teams within the InfoSec organization, which has impacted teamwork, morale, productivity and retention,\u201d he wrote in the memo. While everything else about Amazon seemed to be growing exponentially, the security team had lost even more people. At 345 staffers, it was down 100 from its budgeted headcount.\nCarter went on to sound many of the same alarms that his predecessors had: Amazon still didn't know where all of its data was. The company still didn't have nearly enough capacity to detect threats automatically. And it still gave its employees far too much access to sensitive customer data. The difference was that for Carter, the danger posed by Amazon's own employees\u2014\u201cthe ability for a rogue employee to abuse internal systems for their own purposes,\u201d as he put it\u2014had now become a vivid reality. And it would only become more grotesquely so as 2018 dragged on.\nWhen Anna Lam was a young girl growing up on the Pacific island of Nauru, her mother would sometimes drop a piece of cool-green jade into a cup of herbal tea to calm her childhood fears. As a middle-aged adult living in New York City decades later, Lam started a business selling beauty products, some of them made from the same green semiprecious stone. Her most popular item on Amazon was something called a jade roller: a small cosmetic tool that looks a bit like an attractive miniature paint roller, designed for massaging one's face. To market the product under her brand, GingerChi, Lam put up some artfully staged close-ups of her own daughter using one of the rollers.\nJade rollers have an ancient Chinese pedigree, but in the mid-2010s it was their cachet on Instagram that made them hugely popular. By the fall of 2017, the living room of Lam's apartment was cluttered with boxes for shipping her rollers to customers. That's when she first noticed something weird on Amazon: Her daughter's face had shown up on a listing for someone else's jade roller. A rival seller called Krasr had grabbed Lam's photos to help sell their own copycat product. Lam reported the apparent violation to Amazon, and the photos were taken down.\nTwo months later, Lam received an order from a Canadian customer named Mohamed Multhazim Akbar Ali and realized he was the owner of the Krasr trademark. So she decided not to fulfill the order but didn't spare it much more thought. She was too busy dealing with her company's skyrocketing popularity. That November, the actress Lea Michele had plugged Lam's GingerChi jade roller on Instagram. Then Lam's products made the 2017 holiday gift guides for Time Out New York and Us Weekly. \u201cIt just went like wildfire,\u201d she says. And then after that, \u201call hell broke loose.\u201d\nThat spring, mysterious sellers on Amazon started issuing copyright infringement complaints against Lam, which prompted Amazon to suspend her account. She tried emailing her accusers but never heard back, so she suspected that Krasr was behind the complaints. Krasr had also relaunched his own jade roller with a marketing push.\nWhen Lam finally managed to get her account reinstated, months later, her own Amazon listing seemed to turn against her, as if possessed: Customers would order a GingerChi jade roller, but they would sometimes receive a Krasr-branded roller in the mail instead, and their credit card payments would go to Lam's rival. The Krasr rollers looked similar to Lam's product, down to the cloth bag and informational insert, but they were sometimes defective. So Krasr got the sale, customers got an off-putting bait-and-switch, and Lam got the bad reviews. (\u201cEverything about this is suspicious,\u201d one GingerChi reviewer wrote after receiving a Krasr-branded roller that didn't roll.)\nWith time, the hijackers on her listing multiplied: A rotating cast of other sellers purported to offer her GingerChi jade roller right from her own page. One of them was mockingly named KingerChi. Lam tried to enlist Amazon's help. She'd order the rollers off her page, take pictures showing they were not hers, and send complaints to Amazon. After a long wait, one or two sellers peddling copycat rollers disappeared, but others would pop up, stealing her orders. Lam hired lawyers to write pleading letters to the company. By now she was losing money, had laid off an employee, and worried her business would go under. After a while, she couldn't help but think that Amazon simply didn't care.\nKrasr, after all, had been the subject of a long expos\u00e9 on CNBC in the fall of 2017. The story identified Ali by name and described how, for more than six months, Krasr had attacked a Los Angeles\u2013based skin care business, seeming to infiltrate and sabotage its Amazon account in a series of moves that were sometimes uncannily similar to what was now happening to Lam. The story quoted hectoring text messages from a Krasr representative to the seller, claiming to be the \u201cvirus of Amazon\u201d and threatening war.\nAmazon's response to the story was to quote corporate scripture, saying that the company \u201cis constantly innovating on behalf of customers and sellers\u201d and that it moves quickly whenever it detects bad actors abusing its systems. And yet almost a year after the CNBC story appeared, Krasr was still attacking Lam with impunity.\nThe man behind Krasr, meanwhile, seemed to be living large. Ali\u2014or Zim, as he called himself\u2014was in his early twenties at the time, getting a computer science degree at the University of Toronto. His Instagram account showed a confident, fashionable young man with a penchant for world travel, scuba diving in one post and riding a camel in another. At one point he attended a conference designed to help Canadian businesses tap into Chinese ecommerce, where he snapped a photo of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau onstage. (Ali did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\nAs he targeted GingerChi, Krasr ran a smorgasbord of other product lines, hawking everything from ultrasonic pest-repellent devices to anti-snoring aids on Amazon. Some of his customers left reviews saying they were offered money or freebies to delete bad reviews. Lam didn't understand how Amazon let him get away with attacking sellers for so long. Surely Krasr had to be on the company's radar.\nLam didn't know, of course, how patchy Amazon's radar actually was. But Krasr eventually caught the company's attention. In November 2018, Krasr featured prominently in one of the security division's memos, a draft of Carter's quarterly six-pager to Wilke and other top execs. The security team had uncovered the disturbing secret of Krasr's success: He had moles inside of Amazon. \u201cThis seller recruited our employees over LinkedIn and Facebook,\u201d the memo said. Over a series of years, these insiders had received approximately $160,000 in payoffs. In return, they used their access privileges to offer him godlike powers over the platform and any seller he wished to target.\nKrasr's moles leaked him information on customers and their orders, shared internal business reports, and handed over information on best-selling products so Krasr could copy them (a move that Amazon itself has been accused of using to beat out its independent sellers). At Krasr's direction, they would reinstate accounts that had been suspended for illicit activity. And at times they would block sellers who were in good standing, just so that Krasr\u2014in the manner of a ransom scheme\u2014could offer to help.\nAccording to Carter's memo, Amazon had caught seven of the employees who were working with Krasr, and they had spilled their secrets. All of them had been fired. But Krasr himself proved elusive. Amazon had referred him to the FBI, the memo said. \u201cWe believe Krasr is traveling between Toronto and Thailand and have retained a private investigator to confirm his whereabouts,\u201d the memo stated. (\u201cAny marketplace with a good amount of activity is going to have bad actors try to take advantage,\u201d says Bemisderfer.)\nKrasr had finally rattled Amazon's security leaders, but he wasn't an isolated case. The team also discovered an employee in China who had shared confidential information with a data broker, who then sold it on the Chinese messaging service WeChat, according to the memo. Plus they found an employee in China who offered a bribe to an employee in India to help certain sellers.\nTo make matters worse for Amazon, word of the company's corruption problem was beginning to get out. In fall 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that employees there were slinging data for cash and that one was fired for leaking customer emails to a seller.\nIn response to the Journal stories, Amazon launched an internal project, codenamed Glass Door, to develop ways to fix the problem. But security leaders weren't particularly optimistic: \u201cThese threat actors are financially motivated and will remain persistent at acquiring our data,\u201d a draft of a memo from Carter to Amazon's execs said, \u201cuntil the financial burden on the attacker is greater than their financial gain.\u201d\nIn January 2020, after just over a year and a half in the role, Carter left his job running Amazon's information security department. His exit sent the division into yet another several months of floundering without a chief.\nAmazon eventually hired John \u201cFour\u201d Flynn to fill the role. Flynn arrived from Uber, where he had served as chief information security officer during a period when employees there were using their data privileges to track the movements of ex-girlfriends and celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9. Those abuses came to light not because Uber disclosed them but because a whistleblower filed a lawsuit against the company\u2014and alleged, in that suit, that he was fired in part for raising his concerns with Flynn. (Uber said it maintains strict policies to protect customer data and that it fired fewer than 10 employees for improper access. The lawsuit ended in a settlement.)\nFlynn was also at Uber when the company hushed up a massive hack of user data. Around the time Flynn was hired at Amazon last year, his old boss at Uber, security chief Joseph Sullivan, was indicted for allegedly paying off hackers to keep the data breach hidden from the public and federal authorities. Flynn, who hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing, testified before Congress that he wasn't involved in the payout. \u201cI think we made a misstep in not reporting to consumers,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cAnd I think we made a misstep in not reporting to law enforcement.\u201d\nAt Amazon, Flynn inherits some of the same problems that plagued Carter. Shady online services still openly advertise their ability to provide insider access for a fee. Many promise to provide internal screenshots of Amazon's system, one advertising them for $175, or customer emails. Photos of a laptop open to Amazon's internal seller support portal, reviewed by Reveal and WIRED, showed the location data of the exact spot in India where the images were taken last year.\nIn September 2020, federal prosecutors indicted six people in a scheme to bribe Amazon employees, saying the conspiracy had continued from at least 2017 to 2020. The trial is slated for next year. Some industry consultants say the problem of employee corruption is as bad as ever. But Amazon says it strongly rejects the notion that it has a problem with bribery.\nAmazon also told Reveal and WIRED that it would \u201ccontinue to enforce and remove seller accounts who have relations with Mohamed Multhazim Akbar Ali should any of these surface in the future.\u201d But in fact, Krasr has been back in action for some time. Ali has a new company, ZB Ventures, which Reveal and WIRED were able to connect to more than 20 brands peddling everything from beard straighteners to massage guns on Amazon (some even earning an \u201cAmazon's Choice\u201d label). The brands' product pages are also littered with reviews from customers who say they were promised free upgrades in exchange for positive reviews\u2014a practice that violates Amazon's policies.\nAli himself is still in the wind. \u201cI have over 8 different online businesses which are mostly automated,\u201d he says in his profile on the Couchsurfing social network, \u201cso I'm free most days to help, explore, and enjoy life.\u201d\nAmazon's security division carries a much heavier burden. Bemisderfer writes that the memos and emails discussed in this article are \u201cold documents\u201d that \u201cdo not reflect Amazon's current security posture,\u201d and some security staffers who have left the company tend to agree. The division is making some progress, they say. Amazon's systems for automatically detecting threats\u2014an area where the company says it has made investments\u2014are indeed constantly improving. The company says it has made significant investments in tools that identify \u201cwhere personal data is stored and how it flows\u201d and procedures that give employees \u201caccess to only the data that is critical to complete a particular assignment.\u201d But on the whole, former employees say, the security division is still adrift.\n\u201cIt's going to take forever to turn that ship,\u201d says one former security manager. What Amazon does well is build new things quickly, the former manager says; what it doesn't do well is solve complex problems that take multiple teams and years to address. Meanwhile, the bloodletting continues, as the division keeps losing experienced security pros through attrition. The lineup of executives who receive Flynn's six-pagers has also changed: Jeff Wilke retired from Amazon in March 2021.\nMeanwhile, Amazon's vast attack surface of customer data, and its potential pool of \u201cinternal threat actors,\u201d have both grown at a rate that is nearly incomprehensible. Just since DeVore's testimony in 2018, the company has doubled its number of Prime members, to 200 million. It has also more than doubled its number of employees worldwide, to nearly 1.5 million.\nThe company has achieved huge scale in another sense as well: In August 2021, true to the warnings of Amazon's privacy staffers, officials in Luxembourg levied $883 million in fines against the company for GDPR violations, a penalty more than twice as large as all prior GDPR fines against other companies put together. (Amazon says the decision relates to the advertising that it shows European customers. The company strongly disagrees with the ruling and is appealing it.)\nStill, public faith in Amazon has remained high. In July 2020, a year before he too stepped down as CEO, Jeff Bezos testified before Congress for the first time ever, to defend Amazon against growing antitrust sentiment in Washington. (In a social media post before the hearing, Ali scoffed at the idea that lawmakers would ever rein Bezos in. \u201cHe's definitely above the law,\u201d the man behind Krasr wrote. \u201cNothing can be done about it.\u201d) In his opening remarks to Congress, Bezos nodded to some of the now-plentiful studies that find Amazon to be one of the most trusted institutions in America. \u201cWho do Americans trust more than Amazon to do the right thing?\u201d he asked the committee. \u201cOnly their doctors and the military.\u201d But as he added in his statement, \u201cCustomer trust is hard to win and easy to lose.\u201d Is Amazon worthy of it?\nThis article appears in the December/January issue.

      "text": "As America\u2019s most decorated civil servants sipped cocktails in the presidential ballroom of the Capital Hilton, worrying about their table assignments and wondering where they fell in the pecking order between US senator and UAE ambassador, Elon Musk sat staring at his phone, laughing.\nFew of the guests at the Alfalfa Club banquet in Washington, DC, on January 25 knew what he knew: that a crew of senior executives and young Musk loyalists was preparing to occupy the top offices of a nearby federal building. Under guard, they would sleep on mattresses lined with body temperature and breath rate sensors as they raced to refactor the nation\u2019s code base\u2014or, better yet, scrap it altogether.\nMusk wasn\u2019t big on formalities, but he\u2019d dressed up for the occasion. The Alfalfa Club had been around since 1913 and existed solely to host a yearly banquet where the most important people in government could hobnob with the most important people in business. Membership was limited to around 200, and the Alfalfas admitted new \u201csprouts\u201d only when existing members died. That evening, Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan and Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman joined the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and US senator Kirsten Gillibrand as members. Musk was attending as a guest.\nThe social chairs of the Alfalfa Club seemed to think that elections and constitutional norms should determine the seating chart in American political life. The head table was reserved for Alfalfas in government. Musk, the assumed leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, sat on the opposite side of the room. He spent much of the dinner on his phone\u2014talking to the president, if whispers were to be believed. Musk was closer than ever to Donald Trump. He told friends he was crashing in government buildings. He would soon move in next door to the White House, staying in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u2019s Secretary of War Suite. He\u2019d even had his video-gaming rig installed there.\nAs Musk sat in the Hilton ballroom, his operatives, working under a trusted lieutenant, had already gained access to systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal HR department for 2.2 million or so career civil servants. Many of these operatives would show up later at agencies across the federal government\u2014people like Akash Bobba, a UC Berkeley graduate and former intern at Palantir, the defense contractor cofounded by Peter Thiel; Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old who has gone by the online nickname \u201cBig Balls\u201d; and Nikhil Rajpal, an engineer in his thirties who had worked at Twitter during Musk\u2019s acquisition, where he\u2019d once pitched the idea of auctioning off dormant usernames to the highest bidder. As an undergraduate, also at UC Berkeley, Rajpal had been president of a libertarian student group that was fond of the motto \u201cFutuate cohortem urbanam\u201d\u2014Latin for something like \u201cFuck these city dwellers.\u201d\nIn Musk\u2019s mind, Washington needed to be debugged, hard-forked, sunset. His strike teams of young engineers would burrow into the government\u2019s byzantine bureaucratic systems and delete what they saw fit. They\u2019d help Trump slash the budget to the bone. Musk turned to those around the table at the Hilton: Can you believe we were spending taxpayer money on condoms? They shook their heads. Musk looked back at his phone. Then: What if we cut all federal grants to NGOs?\nIn the days and weeks that followed, DOGE hit one part of the federal government after another. The Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and Veterans Affairs; the Federal Aviation, General Services, Social Security, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric administrations; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service; the US Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the National Park Service and the National Science Foundation\u2014all fell under Musk\u2019s control. An estimated tens of thousands of federal employees were effectively fired or resigned. \u201cThis is a digital coup,\u201d one USAID source told WIRED at the time.\n| Got a Tip? |\n|---|\n| Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at makenakelly.32, velliott88.18, dell.3030, DavidGilbert.01, Kateknibbs.09, or dmehro.89. |\nAlong the way, DOGE also gained access to untold terabytes of data. Trump had given Musk and his operatives carte blanche to tap any unclassified system they pleased. One of their first stops: a database previously breached more than a decade ago by alleged Chinese cyberspies that contained investigative files on tens of millions of US government employees. Other storehouses thrown open to DOGE may have included federal workers\u2019 tax records, biometric data, and private medical histories, such as treatment for drug and alcohol abuse; the cryptographic keys for restricted areas at federal facilities across the country; the personal testimonies of low-income-housing recipients; and granular detail on the locations of particularly vulnerable children.\nWhat did DOGE want with this kind of information? None of it seemed relevant to Musk\u2019s stated aim of identifying waste and fraud, multiple government finance, IT, and security specialists told WIRED. But in treating the US government itself as a giant dataset, the experts said, DOGE could help the Trump administration accomplish another goal: to gather much of what the government knows about a given individual, whether a civil servant or an undocumented immigrant, in one easily searchable place.\nWIRED spoke with more than 150 current and former federal employees, experts, and Musk supporters across more than 20 agencies to expose the inner workings of DOGE. Many of these sources requested anonymity to speak candidly about what DOGE has done\u2014and what it might do next.\nMusk and Trump\u2019s relationship was cemented on July 13, 2024, when a would-be assassin came within inches of killing the former president in Butler, Pennsylvania. Musk was impressed by the photo of Trump, blood streaming down his face, raising his fist in the air and shouting \u201cFight, fight, fight\u201d for the cameras. The image quickly became a meme\u2014Musk\u2019s love language. He endorsed Trump that day and pivoted his recently launched super PAC to get the former president reelected.\nThe following month, during a live discussion on X, Musk floated the idea of working for Trump on a \u201cgovernment efficiency commission.\u201d Trump\u2019s response was enthusiastic. \u201cYou're the greatest cutter,\u201d he said admiringly.\nTwo years earlier, after Musk purchased Twitter in a chaotic blitz of last-minute paperwork and hundred-million-dollar money transfers, he had cut roughly 80 percent of the company\u2019s staff, closed at least a dozen international offices, and rolled back Twitter\u2019s content moderation policies in the name of free speech. He demanded change at such speed that one of his lieutenants, Steve Davis, took to sleeping at Twitter\u2019s San Francisco headquarters with his partner and their newborn baby.\nIn Washington, Musk estimated that his team could cut \u201cnearly $2 trillion\u201d from the federal budget. After you set aside nondiscretionary spending such as Medicare and Social Security benefits and interest payments on the national debt, that number, $2 trillion, was a little more than what you had left over. In other words, Musk was functionally proposing to cut everything else, from foreign aid to housing subsidies, from the maintenance of national parks to the collection of basic weather data, from investigations into predatory lenders to the operation of air traffic control systems.\nAfter Trump won, he announced that Musk, along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, would colead DOGE. The announcement kicked off a stealthy recruiting process, led by Davis, the same executive who\u2019d slept at Twitter HQ. Musk pictured a team of super-high-IQ individuals joining him in Washington for an 80-hour-a-week, 18-month hackathon on the US government.\nThe DOGE brain trust camped out on the eighth floor of the SpaceX office in Washington, DC, commandeering multiple conference rooms and conducting meetings and interviews with DOGE hopefuls, according to a person with knowledge of the events. One question for applicants: Who did you vote for in 2024?\nAmong Davis\u2019 early recruits was Zsombor (Anthony) Jancso, a San Francisco\u2013based engineer and former Palantir employee in his mid-twenties. After Palantir, Jancso had worked on a project called Accelerate X, which purported to offer \u201ca modern OS for government\u201d with solutions \u201cdelivered in days.\u201d His cofounder, an MIT-educated engineer named Jordan Wick, joined DOGE too.\nA few weeks after the 2024 election, an online handle associated with Jancso reached out to a group of people who had participated in an AI challenge put on by the US Space Force. The person said they were looking for \u201chardcore engineers\u201d and instructed applicants to send their GitHub or LinkedIn to @DOGE on X and reply privately with their X handle. (To do all this, they\u2019d need to pay for X premium.) Not long after that, the same handle posted in a group for Palantir alums: \u201cThis is a historic opportunity to build an efficient government, and to cut the federal budget by 1/3.\u201d\nLuke Farritor, a 23-year-old engineer, quickly joined in the DOGE recruitment effort. The son of an academic at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a physician, Farritor was homeschooled and filled his childhood bedroom with books by James Baldwin and Jordan Peterson. During college he got prestigious internships at SpaceX and took to wearing his SpaceX T-shirt all the time. Later, Farritor came to a certain nerdy prominence for his role in using machine learning to decipher an ancient papyrus charred by the same volcanic eruption that buried Pompeii. He said his work received support from a $2 million gift from the Musk Foundation, and Musk backed it on X. The papyrus project also helped earn Farritor a Thiel Fellowship last spring\u2014a $100,000 grant funded by the oligarch and meant to encourage bright young people to drop out of college, which Farritor promptly did.\nOn December 5, Farritor posted in a Discord group for SpaceX interns, noting that DOGE was looking for \u201cskilled software engineers (and ops people) at any career stage who are willing to work for ~6mo in person in DC. Paid.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix the government!\u201d\nMusk, meanwhile, was spending time at Mar-a-Lago and getting a crash course on American civics, as taught by an array of Washington bureaucrats, venture capitalists, and right-wing shitposters on X. One of Musk\u2019s advisers was Antonio Gracias, a private equity investor and early Tesla backer, who later summarized what they\u2019d learned on a podcast: \u201cA department just basically asks for money from Treasury and they send it out.\u201d\nOf course, the truth was a lot more complicated. Before the Treasury cuts a check, the payment authorization has to pass through an array of bespoke technical systems built up over decades to ensure that the money Congress appropriates is properly spent by the executive branch. The system is inefficient by design, so as to provide backstop after backstop. To Musk, that meant it was ripe for disruption. (His adviser Gracias would go on to become a DOGE \u201cIT specialist\u201d at the Social Security Administration.)\nStill, Musk seemed to grasp that he\u2019d been cavalier in setting his goal at $2 trillion. Government spending factors into gross domestic product; that level of cutting, the economist Dean Baker told WIRED, would represent a hit to the economy akin to the 2008 financial crisis, with the potential to produce double-digit unemployment. By mid-January, Musk suggested that $1 trillion\u2014a sum merely greater than the entirety of nondefense discretionary spending\u2014was a reasonable aim. He started to home in on individual government agencies. He seemed especially eager to eviscerate USAID, the government\u2019s primary instrument for foreign aid. The right-wing conspiracy theories he\u2019d eventually repost on X portrayed it as a criminal enterprise, a tool of the deep state\u2019s woke agenda.\nAs Trump\u2019s second inauguration drew near, Musk\u2019s and Ramaswamy\u2019s visions for DOGE started to sharply diverge. Ramaswamy advocated an incremental approach: Push for changes in law that would eventually cut off spending at the source. Musk didn\u2019t want to wait around for that. Increasingly, his plans seemed in line with a scheme that incoming vice president JD Vance had laid out in a podcast interview in 2021: Fire all midlevel civil servants and replace them with Trump loyalists. Just before Trump officially took office, Musk\u2019s vision won out, and Ramaswamy left the organization.\nTrump officially established DOGE on the afternoon of his inauguration. He effectively pasted it on top of the US Digital Service, an Obama-era agency set up to attract private-sector talents into a few years of civil work. Now the D in USDS would stand for \u201cDOGE.\u201d The order also established another organization within it\u2014the US DOGE Service Temporary Organization\u2014that would expire on July 4, 2026. This would give DOGE the ability to bring in special government employees, people who would serve for a limited time before returning to the private sector and who, critically, would not be subject to the same transparency requirements as regular government workers.\nAs Trump\u2019s presidency began, the DOGE brain trust broke camp at SpaceX headquarters in DC. An employee who was there says they left a men\u2019s bathroom \u201ctrashed.\u201d One of the urinals was \u201cfilled with gum and Zyn.\u201d\nDaisy Kid Henderson first heard from DOGE around 9:30 pm on Inauguration Day, when she received an email inviting her to a meeting with anonymous staffers the following afternoon. Henderson, a fiery 28-year-old software engineer at the USDS, describes herself as an \u201ceternal optimist.\u201d Still, she found the lack of names on the invite disconcerting.\nHenderson, who is based in Denver, had been working for the USDS since January 2024. She landed there after a seven-year stint at Comcast, where her job involved everything from quantum computing to robotics to an audio algorithm for filtering sounds that people with PTSD or autism might find triggering. For Henderson, USDS was a chance to take a breath and reevaluate her career while doing some good. \u201cIt was my dream job,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWhen I was hired on, it was even better than I imagined.\u201d Henderson had overseen three generative AI pilot programs at the Department of Homeland Security. One, created for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, helped local officials plan and apply for disaster aid funding. She also partnered with the Food and Nutrition Service to help a number of states more quickly deliver assistance to low-income families.\nBy the time Henderson\u2019s appointment with DOGE rolled around, she recalls, \u201cthey had been doing these meetings all day nonstop.\u201d DOGE \u201chad four or five interviewers and worked in shifts,\u201d Henderson says, likely in an attempt to churn through all 200 legacy USDS employees as quickly as possible. According to another USDS staffer, someone had tried asking the interviewers for their last names, and the reply had been: \u201cThis is a one-way conversation. We won't be answering any questions.\u201d\nOne question the DOGE people seemed to be asking everyone: What do you think about DOGE?\nHenderson tried to stay positive as her call with the two young DOGE operatives began. They introduced themselves by their first names only, Cole and Ram. (That was Cole Killian, a 24-year-old who had attended McGill University, and Nikhil Rajpal, the former college libertarian and X employee.) As the men asked Henderson about her projects, they seemed particularly interested in her AI-related work for FEMA and her technical abilities. Then the questions took a strange turn\u2014centering around \u201cwho the underperformers are at USDS,\u201d Henderson recalls, and what skills she brought to her role. At one point, Killian simply got up and walked out of the room without a word. Rajpal carried on as though nothing had happened. Afterward, Henderson learned her colleagues had been asked whether they should keep their jobs.\nSimilarly strange meetings were going on at the General Services Administration, another early DOGE target. If OPM was the federal government\u2019s HR department, GSA was the operations and IT departments rolled into one. It oversaw more than 1,000 federally owned buildings, from anonymous office parks to minimalist masterpieces, along with hundreds of thousands of government vehicles and tens of billions in annual government purchasing.\nAs would happen at agencies across the government, the GSA seizure took place in the shadows\u2014a matter not of announcements but of calendar invitations from unknown people, of unfamiliar names appearing in internal directories. The sixth and seventh floors, which had offices and suites used by the administrator, the \u201cA-suite,\u201d were restricted and largely locked down. No longer could employees simply badge in through the turnstile. Now they had to pass through metal detectors and have their belongings x-rayed.\nDuring that first week, GSA employees caught a glimpse of a whiteboard sitting in a large, vacant room with three items written on it:\nNo one in the rank and file seemed to know who wrote it or what it meant.\nAs one of Musk\u2019s top operatives at the GSA, DOGE installed Nicole Hollander\u2014Steve Davis\u2019 partner, the other parent of the newborn who slept at Twitter HQ. A former Tesla software engineer, Thomas Shedd, became the director of the GSA\u2019s Technology Transformation Services, which operates dozens of crucial systems used across government agencies, including Login.gov, Cloud.gov, and the Federal Procurement Data System, a database that makes all unclassified government contracts above the micropayment level freely available to the public. DOGE\u2019s strike force at GSA included Coristine, the young engineer known as \u201cBig Balls,\u201d and Farritor, the papyrus whiz kid. Another young DOGE recruit, Ethan Shaotran, also got a GSA email account and A-suite clearance. Shaotran had recently served as the president of Harvard\u2019s mountaineering club. He\u2019d drifted into DOGE\u2019s orbit at a hackathon for xAI, another company Musk owns.\nSoon it became clear that DOGE wanted GSA to adopt one product in particular: an AI chatbot that could plug into the agency\u2019s main portal, the Enterprise Data Solution. Such a tool would allow a handful of DOGE technicians to ask questions in plain language and get answers from vast stores of government data. (How this would accord with the GSA\u2019s Internal Data Sharing Policy, which mandates that requests for certain kinds of controlled unclassified information must be approved by supervisors, was unclear.) To DOGE operatives unfamiliar with GSA\u2019s systems, this might have seemed like a quick build\u2014particularly if the team used an off-the-shelf large language model, like Claude or Gemini or Llama, as a starting point.\nBut the engineers at GSA knew the project DOGE had in mind was far more complex than it seemed. The Enterprise Data Solution is a maze of disparate databases, analytical tools, and machine-learning systems, all with tightly controlled permissions. Creating even a quick chatbot that could tap into these datasets and produce useful answers was anything but trivial. During the Biden administration, employees at TTS had started exploring the possibility of building a simpler chatbot called GSAi, which they hoped would increase productivity by helping people write emails and eventually process contract and procurement data. By the end of Biden\u2019s term, though, there was no GSA chatbot on the horizon.\n\u201cAnyone can build a chatbot today; it's really not that interesting,\u201d a data scientist remarked during a February meeting about GSAi. A version of it\u2014one that wasn\u2019t directly connected to EDS\u2014was set to go live soon. \u201cThe interesting part is in the quality. Can we build a high-quality chatbot, one where our domain expertise is being applied?\u201d\nTo bridge the gap, GSA engineers proposed building what they called a discovery layer, an intermediary designed to decode user queries, identify relevant data sources, and generate precise searches that returned data the AI could interpret. The proposal, pitched to the A-suite\u2014the select group that sources say includes DOGE members like Davis and Hollander\u2014would also give GSA the ability to audit queries and check the quality of the responses. But for that to work, every database would need to be mapped, its columns and metadata described and categorized, ensuring the system understood what data lived where. None of this would happen automatically. It would be a manual, painstaking process.\nAs the GSA engineers discussed the scope of what needed to happen, according to sources familiar with the events, they seemed deflated. DOGE\u2019s timeline was unrealistic. \u201cThis is a multiyear play,\u201d one employee said bluntly in a meeting about the project, \u201cand they think in terms of days and weeks.\u201d\nA day after the Alfalfa Club dinner, rumors were swirling that the Department of Housing and Urban Development would soon have its funding frozen. Grantees who already had their projects approved\u2014state and county governments, nonprofits\u2014began aggressively drawing down their funding at an unprecedented scale. While HUD employees could have stopped the withdrawals, they didn't. And so, in the space of just a few days, around 1,400 grantees withdrew $1.5 billion in federal funding\u2014five times the normal rate, according to data compiled from the agency's banking system and shared with WIRED.\nFor Musk to gain what he seemingly most wanted\u2014a \u201cdelete\u201d button he could wield against any agency by cutting off its funding at the source\u2014he would need direct access to the US Treasury. DOGE dispatched operatives to the Treasury\u2019s Bureau of Fiscal Service, which controls more than $5 trillion in disbursements, including Social Security and Medicare payments, tax refunds, and the salaries of federal workers. The operatives wanted access to two key systems: the Payment Automation Manager and the Secure Payment System. David Lebryk, the highest-ranking career official at the Treasury, retired rather than comply. The financial journalist and payments expert Nathan Tankus would later say that the news of Lebryk\u2019s retirement gave him a \u201cpanic attack,\u201d because everyone above Lebryk was a political appointee.\nMeanwhile, Farritor and a DOGE colleague had started showing up at USAID, one of Musk\u2019s political b\u00eates noires. They carried backpacks with six or seven laptops each, sources familiar with the events told WIRED, and were allegedly instructed to access \u201cemployee email accounts and all digital infrastructure,\u201d according to a lawsuit later filed against DOGE on behalf of USAID employees. Initially turned away for lack of security clearance, they came back with a handwritten note on stationery from the Executive Office of the President saying they were suitable.\nOn X, Musk called USAID a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d and said it was \u201ctime for it to die\u201d; Trump alleged that the agency was \u201crun by a bunch of radical lunatics.\u201d According to The Washington Post, Farritor and the other DOGE operative would run manually through payments, clicking off lifesaving programs. On February 3, Musk bragged that he had spent the weekend \u201cfeeding USAID into the wood chipper.\u201d\nSoon afterward, as WIRED first reported on February 4, a 25-year-old former X engineer named Marko Elez was granted the ability not only to read the code in the Treasury systems but also to write\u2014or change\u2014it. With that level of access, he (or anyone he reported to) could potentially have cut off congressionally authorized payments, effectively allowing Trump or Musk to exercise a line-item veto. More immediately ominous to people familiar with the systems was the possibility that, by tampering with the code, Elez could cause the systems, in whole or in part, to simply stop working. \u201cIt\u2019s like knowing you have hackers on your network, but nobody lets you do anything about it,\u201d a Treasury employee told WIRED.\nThe fact of Elez\u2019s read/write access to Treasury payment systems, confirmed later by Tankus, became a source of contention. Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, denied that DOGE had read/write access. In a letter to Congress that same day, Bessent wrote that members of the Treasury staff, including DOGE operative and Cloud Software Group CEO Thomas Krause, would have \u201cread-only access,\u201d which they needed to \u201ccontinue this operational efficiency assessment.\u201d But the letter didn\u2019t mention Elez, whom a Treasury employee described to WIRED as the \u201chands-on-keyboard\u201d person. (White House officials have gone back and forth about DOGE\u2019s access to Treasury payment systems. This issue ended up in the courts. The cases are ongoing.)\nBy early February, Elez came under fire after The Wall Street Journal found racist comments from accounts linked to him on social media. One suggested that \u201c99%\u201d of immigrant workers from India would be \u201creplaced by slightly smarter\u201d large language models. When the Journal asked whether Elez was connected to the account, he resigned. Later, with public support from Musk and Vice President Vance, DOGE rehired him. Before long, he was designated as an \u201cIT specialist\u201d at another target of Musk\u2019s: the Social Security Administration.\nDOGE had installed a handpicked chief information officer at the SSA\u2014the former CTO of a payments company headed by Jared Isaacman, a billionaire who once commanded two trips to space using SpaceX rockets and is Trump\u2019s current nominee to lead NASA. That new CIO, Michael Russo, had asked to bring on Akash Bobba, the former Palantir intern who had been working out of OPM, as an engineer.\nBut there were \u201cchallenges\u201d with Bobba\u2019s background check, Tiffany Flick, the acting chief of staff to the acting administrator, later stated in a sworn affidavit given in a suit against the SSA. Bobba wasn\u2019t brought on immediately. By February 10, seven days after he was requested to be onboarded, phone calls and emails started to come in\u2014from Russo, Steve Davis, and others\u2014making clear that Bobba was to be given access to SSA systems and data by the end of the day. As Russo and Davis \u201cgrew increasingly impatient\u201d that evening, Flick recalled, Bobba was sworn in over the phone at 9 pm.\nInitially, Flick and officials from the CIO\u2019s office determined that Bobba would be given anonymized, read-only access to records in the Numerical Identification System, which contains information on everyone who has ever applied for a Social Security number. On February 15, Bobba reported that there were issues with the dataset he\u2019d been provided. Russo demanded that Bobba be given full access to \u201ceverything, including source code,\u201d Flick recalled. This included the SSA\u2019s Enterprise Data Warehouse, which contains the \u201cnames of spouses and dependents, work history, financial and banking information, immigration or citizenship status, and marital status,\u201d according to Flick\u2019s affidavit.\nLater that day, the chief information officer for the whole federal government\u2014a political appointee working out of the Office of Management and Budget\u2014issued an opinion to Russo granting Bobba the access. Flick retired. In her affidavit, she expressed serious concerns about the potential for SSA records to be \u201cinadvertently transferred to bad actors\u201d and about \u201cincredibly complex web of systems\u201d being \u201cbroken by inadvertent user error.\u201d\nOver at the USDS, Daisy Kid Henderson had decided it was time for her to leave too. Since DOGE\u2019s takeover, Henderson and her colleagues had had little contact with their new overlords. Each day, the legacy employees logged on to their government laptops to work on projects from the last administration, like generative AI for the IRS. One USDS worker said at the time that they did their best to \u201cignore the clown show.\u201d\nThen Henderson received another email from DOGE: They wanted to speak with her again the following morning. She was told they liked her enthusiasm and wanted to draw her closer into the fray.\nHenderson did not return their admiration. From what she had seen of DOGE, she says, they showed a \u201cblatant lack of regard for the American people\u2019s private data.\u201d Henderson wanted no part of it. Instead of accepting the meeting, she forced-shut down her laptop and phone and didn't acknowledge the email until Monday, when she resigned. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be seen as being locked in with what DOGE was doing,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the flip side, if I was to stand up to them, or to say no, Elon Musk has shown that he is totally OK blasting and doxing employees and having that army descend upon me.\u201d She responded to the email saying she had found a new opportunity in the private sector. She hadn\u2019t, but with her skills, it wouldn\u2019t be long before she did.\n\u201cI was put in a position where, whether I chose to engage or not engage, I might have to cross ethical lines. I would have to breach the oath to the Constitution that I swore. I would have to breach my morals,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was clear I was going to be asked to join in on one of their tirades and work on a complete dismantlement of government systems.\u201d\nLater that month, DOGE imposed a $1 spending limit on federal employee credit cards. The move instantly roiled agencies from the National Park Service to the National Institutes of Health as employees scrambled to buy basic necessities to do their jobs. Yet again, DOGE\u2019s move-fast ethos would put Americans\u2019 personal data at risk.\nAt one SSA office, a manager confirmed to his staff that he could no longer pay the company that shreds sensitive documents. \u201cWe print a lot of shit daily,\u201d one SSA employee told WIRED. \u201cStuff with people\u2019s names, addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, bank accounts, you name it. We have giant locking trash bins we put it in, and we pay a shredding company to empty them every month.\u201d With the new $1 limit, the employee said, a \u201cstockpile\u201d of sensitive data was growing, leaving workers with two options: \u201cShred it ourselves on regular office shredders\u2014of which we have two, I think, and so it would take forever\u2014or just sit on it while it piles up.\u201d\nOther employees at SSA told WIRED that rather than showing their anger at work where they could face retribution, they instead attended weekend protests at Tesla dealerships in DC, part of a nationwide protest effort to drive down the share price of Musk\u2019s electric car company.\nOn March 7, DOGE got one of the things it seemed to want most from GSA: a chatbot that could automate work previously done by federal employees. The tool rolled out to some 1,500 employees at GSA, with an agencywide launch planned a week later. An internal memo about the tool touted the \u201cendless\u201d tasks it could help with: \u201cdraft emails, create talking points, summarize text, write code.\u201d The memo hinted at the dangers of deploying chatbots at the federal level, warning workers not to \u201ctype or paste\u201d internal or personally identifiable information as inputs.\nPeople who used it weren\u2019t impressed. \u201cIt\u2019s about as good as an intern,\u201d one GSA employee told WIRED. \u201cGeneric and guessable answers.\u201d This version of GSAi almost certainly couldn\u2019t interact with the EDS discovery layer first proposed by engineers. More likely it was just the first step in an iterative approach. As one official said in the February meeting about the project, the first goal could be to \u201cdeliver this sort of janky, doesn\u2019t-work-all-the-time chatbot\u201d to pave the way for a \u201cturbo-charged\u201d version down the line.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether DOGE was on the same page.\nAround that time, GSA employees learned there were cuts on the way. \u201cI encourage each of you to consider your options as we move forward,\u201d wrote Stephen Ehikian, GSA\u2019s acting administrator, whose wife had recently worked for Musk at X. \u201cThe new GSA will be slimmer, more efficient, and laser-focused on efficiency and high-value outcomes.\u201d\nSimilar messages were going out across DC. The federal government\u2019s funding was due to lapse on March 14, potentially triggering a shutdown. While Trump was busy lobbying House Republicans to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government afloat until September, WIRED reported that Musk had expressed interest in a shutdown\u2014in part because doing so would potentially make it easier to cut hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\nBut hours before the House convened to vote on the resolution, Musk and Trump had apparently put their differences aside. They convened on the White House\u2019s South Lawn to admire a small fleet of Teslas. Trump had recently posted that he planned to buy one. Of the protesters at Tesla factories who were speaking out against Musk\u2019s work with DOGE, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to catch them\u201d and that they would \u201cgo through hell.\u201d\nThe president and his richest ally walked around the cars, admiring the different colors, before getting into one. \u201cEverything\u2019s computer!\u201d Trump exclaimed, after sitting down. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\nIt was Musk's car, but Trump occupied the driver\u2019s seat.\nUpdated: 3/14/2025, 2:00 PM EDT: The article has been updated to clarify discretionary budget spending.\nAdditional reporting by Paresh Dave and Matt Giles\nLet us know what you think about this article.

The film, featuring Ice Cube as a domestic terror analyst, attempts to address themes of government surveillance and technology's impact on human connection, but is criticized for its poor CGI, plot inconsistencies, and blatant product placements, particularly for Amazon and Microsoft. Additionally, the article highlights the film's failure to effectively critique the tech industry's role in data collection and privacy issues, ultimately rendering it more of a commercial than a thought-provoking narrative.",
