  "content": "The U.S. Department of Justice announced Friday that a California woman who led a transnational white supremacist terror group has pleaded guilty to a sweeping list of charges, including soliciting both hate crimes and the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists.\n\nDallas Humber, 35, of Elk Grove, is the leader of the Terrorgram Collective. She faces up to 30 years in federal prison and is scheduled to be sentenced on December 5. The Justice Department noted that District Court Judge Dena Coggins \"found that Humber's plea was knowing and voluntary, and deferred acceptance of the plea agreement until the sentencing hearing.\"\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Humber led the Terrorgram Collective from July 2022 until her arrest in September 2024. During that time, she and other members of the group solicited individuals to carry out acts of terrorism, assassinations and hate crimes.\n\n\"Humber led a transnational terrorist group promoting white supremacy, hate crimes, and violence, including soliciting the murder of U.S. government officials,\" said John A. Eisenberg, assistant attorney general for National Security. \"Her actions posed a direct threat to our citizens and national security.\"\n\nProsecutors outlined a list of violent incidents inspired by Humber and the Terrorgram Collective. These included plots to attack energy facilities in New Jersey and Tennessee, the murder of two people in Wisconsin as part of a broader assassination plan targeting a federal official, and an attempted assassination of an Australian government official.\n\n\"Humber solicited murders and hate crimes based on the race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity of others,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Kimberly A. Sanchez for the Eastern District of California.\n\nThe group's influence extended far beyond U.S. borders, contributing to international acts of terror such as the 2022 shooting at an LGBT bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, which left two dead; a school shooting in Aracruz, Brazil, in which four were killed; and a stabbing outside a mosque in Eski\u015fehir, Turkey, that injured five.",

      "text": "Related Content\nPress Release\nPress Release\nThe Justice Department announced today that Dallas Humber, 35, of Elk Grove, California \u2014 leader of the Terrorgram Collective, a transnational terrorist group \u2014 pleaded guilty to all charges against her, including soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists.\nDistrict Court Judge Dena Coggins found that Humber\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary, and deferred acceptance of the plea agreement until the sentencing hearing, which is scheduled for Dec. 5. Humber faces a penalty of 25 to 30 years in federal prison.\n\u201cHate and terror have no place in this country or abroad,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. \u201cBy securing this conviction, my office makes clear that purveyors of these heinous crimes will be brought to justice.\u201d\n\u201cHumber led a transnational terrorist group promoting white supremacy, hate crimes, and violence, including soliciting the murder of U.S. government officials,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. \u201cHer actions posed a direct threat to our citizens and national security, and the National Security Division will hold her, as well as others who commit these illegal acts, accountable for their terrorist aims.\u201d\n\u201cHumber solicited murders and hate crimes based on the race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity of others,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Kimberly A. Sanchez for the Eastern District of California. \u201cThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office will continue to work tirelessly with our partners in law enforcement and in the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute those who commit such violations of federal criminal law and keep our people and public officials safe from hate-fueled crimes of violence.\u201d\nWith her guilty plea, Humber admitted the following facts: from July 2022 until her arrest in September 2024, she served as a leader of the Terrorgram Collective, a white supremacist transnational terrorist group. To achieve their ends, she and other members of the Terrorgram Collective solicited individuals to commit hate crimes, terrorist attacks on critical infrastructure, and assassinations; and provided technical, inspirational, and operational guidance to equip those individuals to plan, prepare for, and successfully carry out those attacks.\nInspired and guided by Humber and the Terrorgram Collective, individuals committed attacks or plotted to commit attacks in the United States and elsewhere, including: plotting to attack an energy facility in New Jersey; plotting to bomb an energy facility in Tennessee; murdering two people in Wisconsin in furtherance of plans to assassinate a federal official; and attempting to assassinate an Australian official. In addition, individuals led by Humber and the Terrorgram Collective have committed acts of violence internationally, including shooting three people, killing two, at an LGBT bar in Bratislava, Slovakia; shooting eleven people, killing four, at two schools in Aracruz, Brazil; and stabbing five people outside of a mosque in Eski\u015fehir, Turkey.\nThe FBI Sacramento Field Office investigated the case, with assistance from a variety of foreign and domestic law enforcement agencies.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, National Security Division, and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California are prosecuting the case."

      "text": "Feds say white supremacist leaders of \"Terrorgram\" group plotted assassinations, inspired attacks\nWashington \u2014 Federal prosecutors in California unsealed an indictment Monday charging two people with leading an online group of white supremacists that maintained a list of high-profile targets to assassinate and urging group members to commit hate crimes.\nA 37-page indictment filed on Sept. 5 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California alleges that Dallas Erin Humber and Matthew Robert Allison led the group known as \"Terrorgram,\" a network of channels, group chats and users on the app Telegram, that promote \"white supremacist accelerationism.\" The ideology is described in court filings as \"centered on the belief that the white race is superior,\" and that violence and terrorism are needed to spark a race war to speed up the collapse of government and the rise of the \"white ethnostate.\"\nHumber, 34, and Allison, 37, face 15 federal charges, including three counts of soliciting the murder of a federal official, four counts of soliciting hate crimes and one count of conspiring to provide material support for terrorists. Humber is from Elk Grove, California, and Allison is from Boise, Idaho. Both were arrested last Friday and officials said Allison is expected to make his initial appearance in court on Tuesday.\nHumber pleaded not guilty during an arraignment before a federal magistrate judge Monday. A detention hearing is set for Friday.\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said the indictment shows the \"new technological face of white supremacist violence.\"\n\"Terrorgram\"\nProsecutors allege that Humber and Allison took over the group in 2022, after one of its leaders was arrested and charged with terrorism offenses. As the new leaders of the so-called Terrorgram Collective, the indictment claims that the defendants spread videos and publications called \"The Hard Reset,\" \"White Terror\" and \"The List,\" and solicited group members to carry out attacks against \"racial enemies\" and on crucial infrastructure.\n\"The List\" is described in the indictment as a hit list of \"high-value\" targets for assassination that included their names, addresses and photographers. Among those included were a U.S. senator, a federal district judge and a former U.S. attorney, as well as state and local officials, and leaders of private companies and nongovernmental organizations, according to the indictment.\nCourt filings allege that Allison encouraged Terrorgram members to kill those targets, telling them to \"take action now\" and \"do your part.\" The attacks focused on people who the group viewed as \"perpetuating an irredeemable society\" and whose murders would sow chaos and speed up the collapse of the government, according to the indictment.\nIn addition to the hit list, prosecutors said Allison and Humber provided instructions for making and detonating bombs, and shared a five-step instructional video that explained in part how to find the location of a \"federal building\" that would be \"a suitable target\" and how to avoid being caught by law enforcement.\nFederal investigators alleged the pair pushed users to \"follow through with planned attacks\" and urged their followers to \"immortalize yourself in the Pantheon.\" According to charging documents, some of the members of Humber and Allison's online group were inspired to carry out attacks across the globe.\nThe two frequently used racial slurs and other derogatory language when describing victims of attacks.\nProsecutors said multiple attacks or planned attacks in recent years can be tied to the defendants' group, including an October 2022 shooting in Slovakia at an LGBTQ bar where two people were killed and an attack in Turkey where five people were stabbed outside of a mosque. Investigators in the U.S. also foiled a plot in New Jersey where an 18-year-old was planning to attack an energy facility in July, prosecutors said.\nThe two produced and shared a 24-minute documentary called \"White Terror\" that celebrated 105 white supremacist attacks that took place between 1968 and 2021, court filings said. Humber narrated the documentary, which ended with a message to \"the saints of tomorrow,\" reassuring them attacks they perpetrated would be lauded, according to prosecutors.\nThey were in the process of creating \"The Saint Encyclopedia\" celebrating white supremacist attackers and urging Terrorgram users to commit attacks, the Justice Department said. Humber also allegedly shared a graphic of \"Sainthood Criteria\" and the \"Path to Sainthood,\" according to the indictment, and shared at least one message that she said was designed to radicalize a Terrorgram user.\nAnnouncing the charges Monday, Justice Department officials alleged Allison and Humber were not just \"inspirational\" in their planning, but sought to inspire attacks and in some cases, equipped would-be attackers with actionable plans and pushed their members to follow through.\n\"These are not mere words,\" Matt Olsen, head of the Justice Department's National Security Division said Monday.\nA spokesperson for Telegram said \"calls to violence have no place on Telegram's platform. Moderators removed several channels that used variations of the 'Terrorgram' name when they were discovered years ago. Similar content is banned whenever it appears.\"\nThe indictment comes in the wake of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France last month. French prosecutors allege the platform is being used for criminal purposes, including spreading child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking.\nIn a statement posted on his Telegram channel in recent days, Durov pushed back against claims that the site is \"some sort of anarchic paradise\" as \"absolutely untrue,\" but added he made it a \"personal goal to ensure we significantly improve things.\"\n\"We take down millions of harmful posts and channels every day. We publish daily transparency reports [and] direct hotlines with NGOs to process urgent moderation requests faster,\" Durove wrote. \"However, we hear voices saying that it's not enough.\""
