  "content": "A THIS Morning host has been told to \u2018dress appropriately\u2019 by shocked fans after flashing her bum in a 'thirst trap' video.\n\nOlivia Attwood, 34, who recently hosted This Morning for the first time, has been slammed by fans for her very short skirt.\n\nSharing a video of her outfit while visiting the swanky Dorchester hotel in London, the former Love Island star flashed her bottom in the process.\n\nWearing an extremely short skirt, Olivia could be seen skipping up some steps and giving her fans a thrill.\n\nOlivia could be seen wearing an ultra short white miniskirt with a striped jumper and some yellow flat pumps.\n\nShe wore her blonde locks in a half up, half down style, and could be seen showing off her long pins and slender figure.\n\nAs she skipped up the steps of the posh hotel, Olivia's bum cheeks could be seen briefly.\n\n\"I fear this turned into an *accidental* thirst trap,\" she penned in the caption of the clip.\n\nAlthough many fans were no doubt happy for the cheeky display, some were stunned and quick to critique the look.\n\nReacting to Olivia's outfit, some fans were quick to slam the \"inappropriate\" look.\n\n\"Too much. Dress appropriate,\" said one person.\n\nA third penned: \"Nice outfit but can see your knickers.\"\n\nWhile a fourth said: \"Bit short for the Dorchester apart from that love it x.\"\n\nAnd a fifth added: \"I love the outfit but the skirt is too short for my taste! You look amazing thou!\"\n\nBut several other fans loved the ensemble, with one writing: \"If I looked like you I\u2019d wear that outfit too.\"\n\n\"Gotta be one of the fittest girls on the planet,\" swooned a second.\n\nWhile a third added: \"Love it, preppy but cheeky.\"\n\nJust last week, Olivia hosted This Morning with Dermot O'Leary.\n\nShe revealed her huge new telly role in June before exclusively telling The Sun she has \"put the work in\" for the plum broadcasting job.\n\nShe exclusively told The Sun: \"Those who know me understand the hard work I've put in to get where I am today.\n\n\"I'm forever grateful to Love Island for being the springboard to my career, but I\u2019m excited to show there's so much more to me beyond the villa.\"\n\nShe continued: \"It\u2019s been a lot of hard work, but I\u2019ve always stayed focused on my goals and believed in myself and I\u2019m very thankful for ITV in believing me.\"",
