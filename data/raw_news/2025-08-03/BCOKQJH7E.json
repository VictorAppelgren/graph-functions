  "title": "1 Reason to Buy Dogecoin (DOGE)",
  "description": "The original meme coin has a feature not everybody knows about.",
  "content": "The original meme coin has a feature not everybody knows about.\n\nThanks to the recent bull market, Dogecoin (DOGE 3.57%) is up 49% over the last month. And even though most meme coins don't have much staying power, Dogecoin is one of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, more than a decade after its launch.\n\nThe reason meme coins usually don't last is that they have no real value or use case. As surprising as it may sound, Dogecoin has a unique feature that could make it useful.\n\nDogecoin has a fixed amount of inflation. Every year, 5 billion coins are released as block rewards for Dogecoin miners. There's no maximum supply, but the inflation rate gradually decreases because the number of coins created per year stays the same while the existing supply grows larger.\n\nFor example, the current circulating supply for Dogecoin is about 150 billion coins. The inflation rate this year will be a little over 3%. In 10 years, the supply will be up to 200 billion, and the inflation rate will be 2.5%.\n\nThe diminished inflation rate means that for the next several decades, Dogecoin will have a fairly normal, healthy amount of inflation. New coins won't flood the market and lower the value. But since the supply is still increasing, there's less motivation to hoard Dogecoin, like there is with some big cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) being the most famous example. With a fixed maximum supply of 21 million, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that people hold because they expect the value to increase.\n\nDogecoin's website argues that this gives it a more \"utilitarian and practical place in the economy than other cryptocurrencies.\" It's well-suited to work as a legitimate currency, and not just a store of value. Some big names in the crypto community seem to agree, as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban have both expressed support for Dogecoin as a payment method.\n\nWhile Dogecoin could theoretically work as a digital currency, there are downsides. It's volatile, and it's only accepted at about 2,000 merchants right now. If you decide to buy Dogecoin, only invest what you'd be comfortable losing to avoid taking on too much risk.",

      "text": "Meme coins have carved out a peculiar niche in the cryptocurrency market. Some blockchain networks don't have much of a business plan or long-term plans for usability in the real world. Instead, they sidestep traditional financial valuations almost entirely, deriving value from market messages or outright jokes.\nUnderstanding meme coins\nUnderstanding meme coins\nMeme coins are cryptocurrencies that originate from internet memes or have a humorous or viral aspect. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC 1.93%) or Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), which are backed by robust blockchain technologies and have clear utility in digital transactions and decentralized applications (dApps), meme coins often lack a specific purpose beyond the community and cultural value they hold.\nBlockchain\nThe first and most famous example, Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE), was created as a joke in 2013 but has since gained significant popularity and market capitalization. It is based on the same blockchain code that runs the larger, more sincere Bitcoin cryptocurrency but with technical tweaks that make it less useful for real-world payments and storage of monetary value.\nMany newer meme coins don't run their own blockchain networks at all. Rather, they function as tokens supported by existing cryptosystems, such as Ethereum or Solana (CRYPTO:SOL).\nThis strategy makes it even easier to create a new token with a suitably silly marketing message wrapped in the data security and transaction efficiency of the underlying parent network. The technical details can be somebody else's problem.\nWhy meme coins matter\nWhy meme coins matter\nMeme coins spotlight the power of community and sentiment in the digital age. Their value is largely driven by social media, celebrity endorsements, and the broader meme culture that thrives on the internet.\nThis phenomenon underscores a shift in how value is perceived and created in the cryptocurrency space. While traditional assets are evaluated based on fundamentals or utility, meme coins thrive on collective belief and the communal desire to be part of a shared (but speculative) financial journey.\nIt doesn't hurt if your favorite project has a cute mascot, a funny name, or a controversial philosophy. Well-known celebrity backers with millions of social media followers can make a big difference, too. The most popular meme coins often have all of these headline-inspiring qualities.\nMeme coins also serve as an entry point into the cryptocurrency world for many investors. They frequently come with very low dollar-based prices, often paired with viral stories of dramatic gains in the early going. These qualities can attract a whole new demographic of investors looking not just for profits but also for participation in a cultural movement.\nThis idea has important implications for understanding market dynamics, where narrative and hype can significantly influence digital asset prices. One social media post from the right influencer can send a meme coin skyrocketing in a hurry -- or pop a meme coin's inflated valuation just as quickly.\nHave a meme coin? Now what?\nSo, you've got a meme coin on your hands. Now what?\nVenturing into the world of meme coins is like stepping onto a roller coaster with your investment portfolio in tow. Can it be exciting? Absolutely. Is this thrill ride predictable? Not in the slightest. But you should be fine as long as you know what you're getting into. So, here's how you should strap in for the meme coin ride.\nDo your research\nJust like you wouldn't buy a car based solely on its color, diving into meme coins requires a peek under the hood. What's powering its popularity? Is the engine (community support and social media buzz) robust enough to sustain a long journey, or is it running on mere fumes?\nManage your risks\nInvesting in meme coins should be like placing a side bet in an unpredictable casino game rather than betting the farm on a so-called \"sure thing.\" Cryptocurrencies should comprise a moderate portion of your properly diversified investment portfolio, and meme coins can occupy a small sliver of the larger crypto collection.\nMake sure you're comfortable with seeing your meme coin values fluctuate wildly -- sometimes in the blink of an eye and not always for any obvious reason.\nStay informed\nThe meme coin market is as dynamic as a chat room meme war. It pays to keep abreast of trends, news, and shifts in sentiment that can turn today's laughing stock into tomorrow's golden goose -- or vice versa.\nA Dogecoin example\nLet's check out Dogecoin, for example\nPerhaps the epitome of meme coin success, Dogecoin began as a lighthearted parody of Bitcoin but quickly grew into a symbol of the crypto community's playful side. Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has seen substantial price increases from time to time, usually fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from influential figures like Tesla (TSLA -1.69%) CEO Elon Musk.\nIts journey from a pure meme to a solid staple of the crypto market highlights the unpredictable nature of meme coins and their potential for unexpected success. Dogecoin's rise underscores the importance of community in the crypto market, a factor that can turn a simple joke into a billion-dollar asset.\nThe ride down to smaller market caps can be just as quick and unexpected when the early backers stop promoting the meme coin on social media channels. In the cryptocurrency sector, value is not only defined by utility but also by the shared belief and enthusiasm of its holders.\nRelated investing topics\nPerception often becomes reality, for better or worse. Giants like Bitcoin are not immune to this volatility-boosting effect, but meme coins like Dogecoin are always exposed to these unpredictable winds of change. Some go beyond simple jokes and prove to be outright scams in the long run.\nSo, be careful with those adorable meme coins and watch out for pump-and-dump schemes known as \"rug pulls\" in the crypto world."

      "text": "When you first hear about cryptocurrency mining, it sounds too good to be true. By using your computing equipment to verify transactions on a blockchain, you'll earn crypto rewards. It doesn't require much effort on your part, so once you get it set up, it's passive income for you.\nBut there are some potential issues to know about, most notably that mining could cost you more than you earn if you don't plan ahead. To help with that, we're going to cover how to mine cryptocurrency and if it's still profitable in 2022.\nWhat is cryptocurrency mining?\nWhat is cryptocurrency mining?\nCryptocurrency mining is the way that proof-of-work cryptocurrencies validate transactions and mint new coins. It was the first method used that enabled cryptocurrencies to be decentralized. They function without a central governing body confirming their transactions.\nUnder the proof-of-work model, which was introduced with Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), miners check transactions using computing devices that solve complex mathematical equations. By providing the correct answer, the miner has shown proof of doing work.\nThe first miner to get the correct answer wins the right to confirm a block of that cryptocurrency's transactions. When the block is confirmed, it's added to the cryptocurrency's blockchain, a distributed digital ledger of all its transactions.\nThe lucky miner also receives a block reward for the trouble of confirming the transactions. The block reward is a set amount of the cryptocurrency they're mining. The rewards usually come from new coins that have been minted and the cryptocurrency's transaction fees.\nTypes of cryptocurrency mining\nTypes of cryptocurrency mining\nThere are many ways to mine cryptocurrency. Here are the different types of cryptocurrency mining you can choose from:\n- ASIC mining: Mining using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). This type of device is made to mine a specific cryptocurrency. It's expensive, but it also typically provides the highest hash rate, meaning it offers more mining power.\n- GPU mining: Mining using one or more advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), commonly known as graphics cards. These also provide considerable mining power but at a somewhat high up-front cost.\n- CPU mining: Mining using a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Although this is the most accessible way to mine crypto, CPUs don't have nearly as much mining power as ASICs and GPUs. For that reason, profits from CPU mining are minimal.\n- Mining pools: Groups of miners who work together to mine crypto and share block rewards. Miners pay a small percentage of those block rewards as a pool fee.\n- Solo mining: Mining on your own. It's much harder to earn block rewards this way, so mining pools are often the better choice.\n- Cloud mining: Paying a company to mine crypto on your behalf with its own mining devices. Cloud mining requires a contract, and the terms almost always favor the company and not the miner.\nThe right type of mining depends on the type of cryptocurrency and how much you can afford to invest. In most cases, your best bet is to go with either ASIC mining or GPU mining and to join a mining pool.\nHow to mine crypto\nHow to mine crypto\nOnce you're ready to start mining crypto, here are the steps to follow.\n1. Choose a cryptocurrency to mine\nThere are many cryptocurrencies you can mine, but not all of them use this method to verify transactions. Specifically, you'll want to look for cryptocurrencies that use proof of work. Here are some suggestions:\n- Kadena (KDA 6.41%) is a cryptocurrency built for businesses and powering global financial systems. It's one of the more profitable cryptocurrencies when you mine it with an ASIC.\n- Ergo (CRYPTO:ERG) is a platform designed to provide an efficient way to implement financial contracts on blockchain. Because Ergo is resistant to ASIC mining, you can mine it using a GPU.\n- Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) is a meme coin. Although it started as a joke, it became extremely popular in 2021, and it's possible to make a profit mining it with an ASIC.\nOne notable cryptocurrency that I wouldn't recommend mining is Bitcoin. Because it's so popular and there are so many miners competing to earn rewards, it's extremely difficult to make a profit with Bitcoin mining.\n2. Buy your mining equipment\nAfter you've picked a cryptocurrency, start looking at ASICs or GPUs you can use to mine it. A CPU won't cut it in terms of mining power since you'll almost certainly make far less than $1 per day.\nTo compare mining devices, use a profitability calculator for the cryptocurrency you'll be mining. These calculators let you plug in a machine's hash rate and your electricity cost to see how much you'd make per day. Then you can use that information to estimate how long it would take to pay off the cost of the mining device.\n3. Set up a crypto wallet\nAs you mine cryptocurrency, you're going to need a crypto wallet to receive your rewards. Fortunately, this isn't hard to find.\nThe cryptocurrency's website will probably have recommendations on compatible wallets. For most cryptocurrencies, there are plenty of digital wallets that are available free of charge. When you've set up your wallet, you'll be able to generate an address where you can receive and safely store your cryptocurrency.\n4. Configure your mining device\nOnce you have your mining device, there are a couple of things to do to get it ready. First, download the mining software for the cryptocurrency. You should be able to find the software on the cryptocurrency's website.\nMake sure you set up your mining device in a safe location with the proper cooling. Mining devices can generate quite a bit of heat, and they can be a fire risk if you're not careful.\n5. Join a mining pool\nIt's possible to mine cryptocurrency on your own, but that's rarely a good approach. Earning block rewards is much harder when you're mining alone.\nFor that reason, most miners opt for mining pools. Since a mining pool has a group of miners who are combining their efforts, it's more likely that the pool gets chosen to validate a block and earn block rewards.\nIs cryptocurrency mining worth it?\nIs cryptocurrency mining worth it?\nCryptocurrency mining isn't worth it for the typical investor because it's so difficult to make a profit. For crypto enthusiasts, mining may be worthwhile as a hobby and a way to possibly earn some extra money.\nTo make reasonable money from crypto mining, you need an ASIC or a GPU. Many of the most popular choices cost $1,000 or more. Depending on the cryptocurrency you mine and how its price changes, breaking even on your mining device can take six months, a year, or longer. And these devices eventually become obsolete or break down.\nElectricity costs are another important consideration. Crypto mining is usually energy-intensive, and you won't make much money without cheap power.\nYou're probably better off using the money you planned to put in a mining device on a good cryptocurrency investment. That could be something as simple as buying the cryptocurrency you were planning to mine or checking out cryptocurrency stocks.\nIf you want to support your favorite cryptocurrency or you're willing to spend a lot of time maximizing profitability, mining is a viable option. However, most investors will likely find that mining just isn't worth the hassle."

      "text": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, which is a decentralized digital currency that is not regulated by a central authority. Bitcoin gives full control to users instead of financial institutions.\nCryptocurrency\nOver the years, Bitcoin has inspired thousands of new types of cryptocurrency that have built on its technology. It has also become popular as an asset class due to gains in its value. Here's a closer look at how Bitcoin works and how to decide if you should invest in it.\nA brief history of Bitcoin\nA brief history of Bitcoin\nA white paper called \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" released in October 2008, marks the official start of Bitcoin. Released by its author under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the paper described a digital currency that would enable peer-to-peer payments without relying on financial institutions.\nNakamoto was instrumental in the early development of Bitcoin, both by mining the first block and completing the first transaction by sending 10 Bitcoins to programmer Hal Finney. In 2010, Nakamoto disappeared and effectively handed over control to software developer Gavin Andresen.\nBitcoin would see significant and often explosive growth over the years that followed. Its price surpassed $20,000 in 2017, $60,000 in 2021, and $100,000 in 2024. But between these bull markets, it has lost large portions of its value.\nAs Bitcoin has grown in popularity, more retailers have started accepting it and other digital assets. There are currently more than 2,000 U.S. businesses and 15,000 businesses worldwide that accept Bitcoin, according to BitDegree.\nHow does Bitcoin work?\nHow does Bitcoin work?\nBitcoin is a digital currency that uses blockchain technology and cryptography -- writing and solving codes -- to process transactions.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies provide decentralized payments with blockchain technology. The chain of blocks is a public distributed ledger of all transactions made with Bitcoin. When people send and receive Bitcoin, more blocks are added to the chain as transaction records. The blockchain conveys public information that is available to all users, making every Bitcoin transaction traceable and impossible to change.\nCompleting Bitcoin transactions relies on a process called mining. To add a block to the blockchain, a miner must use computing power to solve complex mathematical equations. This is also how new Bitcoins are minted. There are currently more than 19 million Bitcoin in circulation; the maximum total supply is 21 million.\nAlthough computers can solve mining equations, profitable Bitcoin mining requires specialized mining devices such as those made by Nvidia (NVDA -2.26%). It's also energy-intensive and has a negative environmental impact. Bitcoin miners collectively use a significant amount of energy, more than the amounts used by quite a few countries.\nHow to buy Bitcoin\nHow to buy Bitcoin\nHere's how to buy Bitcoin:\n- Set up an account on a cryptocurrency platform.\n- Complete the platform's identity verification process.\n- Deposit money from your bank account.\n- Buy the amount of Bitcoin that you want.\nThere are several places to buy Bitcoin. It's sold on cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as by select stock brokers and some payment apps. Cryptocurrency exchanges offer the most features, so they're well suited for serious crypto investors.\nSince Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin trading is available on just about any exchange. These are a few of the most well-known and highly rated crypto exchanges:\n- Coinbase (COIN -16.57%): Launched in 2012 as a way of making crypto easy to use.\n- Gemini: Founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in 2014 and the first to offer Bitcoin futures contracts.\n- Kraken: Founded in 2011, it is one of the oldest cryptocurrency platforms.\nAfter you choose an exchange and create an account, you can verify your identity with a driver's license, passport, or other valid identification typically issued by a government. Depending on the exchange, you may also need to provide proof of address. This verification is required for tax reporting purposes and to prevent criminal activity such as money laundering.\nMoney Laundering\nMost exchanges accept multiple payment methods. Transferring money from your bank account almost always minimizes your fees, making this the best option.\nOnce your exchange account is funded, you can buy Bitcoin. Specify how much fiat money you want to spend, review the transaction, and confirm the purchase.\nHow to use Bitcoin\nHow to use Bitcoin\nBitcoin is most commonly used as a store of value, with many viewing it as a form of digital gold. They buy and hold it as an alternative investment in hopes that the price will increase.\nUsers can also transfer Bitcoin to other people and pay with Bitcoin for purchases from a limited number of businesses.\nMajor companies that accept Bitcoin as a payment method include AT&T (T 1.26%), AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC -1.55%), and Newegg Commerce (NEGG -16.08%). If you buy Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency via PayPal (PYPL -2.38%), you can use it to pay for purchases from any retailers that accept PayPal Checkout.\nBitcoin is stored in a crypto wallet. When it's bought, sold, traded, or used for purchases, it's transferred from one Bitcoin wallet to another. There are two types of crypto wallets:\n- Hot wallets: These wallets are connected to the internet and are generally free to use.\n- Cold wallets: These wallets aren't connected to the internet, so they provide greater security. The most common types of cold crypto storage are hardware devices.\nWhen you buy Bitcoin, the platform where it's bought puts your Bitcoin in a custodial wallet. Custodial wallets hold Bitcoin for other people but are managed by a third party. Depending on the platform, you may be able to transfer your Bitcoin to your own hot wallet or to a cold wallet. Quite a few buyers do this, and it's a common recommendation so that you have full control of your crypto.\nIs Bitcoin mining a good idea?\nIs Bitcoin mining a good idea?\nEarning a profit as a home Bitcoin miner is difficult because of the expenses involved. The standard costs include a Bitcoin mining machine, electricity, and mining pool fees. Unless you have access to very cheap electricity, you're unlikely to break even.\nBitcoin mining involves setting up a machine to solve the complex equations used in Bitcoin's transaction process. When a miner is the first to solve a block of transactions, they get to add that block to the blockchain and receive rewards.\nIn keeping with Nakamoto's vision, the block reward paid to a Bitcoin miner is cut in half every time another 210,000 blocks are mined. This Bitcoin halving means that the rewards received by miners are continually decreasing. Once all Bitcoin has been mined, Bitcoin miners will only receive transaction fees.\nHere's a closer look at the costs of Bitcoin mining:\n- Bitcoin mining machine: Application-specific integrated circuit miners (called ASICs for short), which are Bitcoin mining machines, can cost thousands of dollars, and they typically are only profitable for two to three years. Newer, faster machines can always outcompete older ones, which won't generate enough income to be worth using.\n- Electricity: Bitcoin mining is not prevalent where electricity prices are high. Since access to affordable electricity is a must, most of the major Bitcoin mining operations are in countries with low power costs.\n- Mining pool fees: Because there are so many Bitcoin miners, it's practically impossible to receive any rewards if you're mining Bitcoin independently. You'll need to join a mining pool, which is a group of Bitcoin miners who work together and pay the mining pool fee. The fee typically ranges from 1.0% to 2.5%, depending on the pool you choose.\nYou can use an online Bitcoin mining profitability calculator to enter numbers for an ASIC and your electricity rate to determine how much, if any, money you'd make. In most cases, there are easier ways to generate passive income. One popular alternative with other coins is staking crypto, which doesn't have the costs of mining.\nRelated crypto topics\nInvesting in Bitcoin in 2025\nInvesting in Bitcoin in 2025\nThere's no denying that owning Bitcoin has been extremely profitable during its short history. Its value increased from $0.06 in 2010 to more than $100,000 at times in 2024. Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency and has become a mainstream investment. It has also become more accessible to investors with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs.\nBitcoin is also a volatile, high-risk investment. It's only existed since 2009, it might never be widely used as actual currency, and newer altcoins have distinct cost and operational advantages. Also, Bitcoin mining is clearly at odds with environmentally responsible investing.\nAlthough Bitcoin shouldn't account for a large portion of the value of your portfolio, a small investment in the cryptocurrency is worth considering. The key is to maintain a balanced, diversified portfolio. If you choose to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency stocks, you'll be well positioned to benefit if Bitcoin rises in value, but you won't be putting all of your eggs in one very volatile basket."
