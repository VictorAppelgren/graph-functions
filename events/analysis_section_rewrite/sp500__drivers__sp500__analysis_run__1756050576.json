      "feedback": "This draft is a solid scaffold but needs a tighter, testable framework to reach world‑class quality. Concrete edits: (1) reorganize into Baseline/Upside/Downside with explicit, source‑anchored triggers and invalidation rules (e.g., Baseline Regime A persists unless automation exposure crosses Brookings’ 25% anchor and labor slack deteriorates for two consecutive quarters; Upside Regime B triggers on that threshold plus a credible policy easing path; Downside Regime C kicks in if policy space tightens materially and inflation/FX shocks force risk premia higher). (2) fix the causal chain: spell out the mechanism from AI/TFP productivity gains to disciplined capex in high‑moat franchises, then to revenue durability and margin/risk premia, making the channels explicit (Fed path → risk‑free rate and capex financing; FX → corporate dollars and cross‑border demand; governance/frictions → exit terms and risk premia). (3) quantify and calibrate: attach probabilistic views and timelines (e.g., 12‑month baseline 60–70%, upside 15–25%, downside 10–15%), and anchor all numbers to the six sources; reconcile any conflicts (e.g., governance signals vs. policy easing) with a short reconciliation note. (4) tighten source usage: ensure every numeric claim cites one of NL5YYTLF2, GX057ADL7, 22PL3Q360, 5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, HWGNUP2XG, and avoid incomplete lines (the Intel/Governance note should be complete and clearly linked). (5) elevate the watch‑list into discrete, monitorable signals with thresholds and invalidation rules (automation exposure level; two‑quarter labor slack trend; FOMC/Dot path shifts; Intel stake moves; Ford/EV unit‑economics turning sustainable; EURUSD regime shift). (6) fix formatting and scope: resolve the truncated “Regime C” sentence, ensure consistent units and timeframes, and remove any redundancy. (7) conclude with a concise, falsifiable statement about fragility and what data would overturn the base case, clearly tying back to the cited sources. This will yield a precise, probabilistic, and source‑reconciled cross‑topic view suitable for decision‑makers.",
