  "title": "Trump: Intel Agreed to Give US a 10% Stake (Full Q&A)",
  "description": "President Donald Trump said Intel Corp. had agreed to give the US government a 10% equity stake in the beleaguered chipmaker, with a formal announcement expected on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve agreed to do it and I think it\u2019s a great deal for them,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday at the White House.\nTrump cast the agreement as one that would revitalize the company, saying that \u201cIntel has been left behind\u201d compared to competitors in the chipmaking industry, and that he had floated the idea when he met with Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan earlier this month. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Because of tariffs and the incentives we give, it's coming back. And it's impossible, I think, for another country to stop it. And we are working on something. We want to be very good to Canada. I like Ernie a lot. I think he's a good, good person and we had a very good talk yesterday, so I think it'll be good. Mr. President, I have a question about the search of a bicycle. And I the vice president was later said in an interview saying that it's about classified documents, but that there is also broad concern about and what are what are the concerns. Well, I haven't spoken to Pam and the group yet, but I will be. I saw that just like everybody else. I try and stay out of this stuff. I'm allowed to be an I'm chief law enforcement officer, believe it or not. You know, I don't like to go around saying that, but I am that's a position. But I purposely don't want to really get involved in it. I'm not a fan of John Bolton. That was a sleazebag, actually. And his stuff is major Trump derangement syndrome, but so do a lot of people. And they're not being affected by anything we do. I don't know anything about it. I should just so that I'll find out about it. But if you believe the news, which I do, I guess his house was raided today, but my house was raided also for moral of them. They went through everything they could, including my young son, Drew, and my wife's area. They went through her drawers as the expression goes. They went through everything you can imagine. And when she came back, she looked she said, she's very neat. You know, she's meticulous. And she looked and she said, well, this wasn't this wasn't the way that she had it. So, you know, so I know the feeling. It's not a good feeling. Thank you, Mr. President. When, Mr. President, how long would you give Putin? A couple of weeks. Wanted to figure it out. Do you think you'll have to intervene at some point? Look, it takes two to tango. You understand that? I wanted to have a meeting with those two. I could have been at the meeting, but a lot of people think that nothing's going to come out of that meeting. You have to be there. Maybe that's true. Maybe it's not. But we're going to see. In the meantime, people continue to die. But I've sold seven of them where they were in Warsaw for 31, 35 and 37 years. We had three of them that were for more than 30 years. John and I got him solved and we solved one that could have been a nuclear war with India and Pakistan that was getting ready to be a nuclear war. I solved them all. And this one, I thought we would have had it done by now, but it's a much more difficult. There's a lot of anger, a lot of hatred. There's a tremendous amount of hatred there. But we'll see what happens. I think in two weeks we'll know which way I'm going because I'm going to go one way or the other and I'll learn which way I'm president if I get to questions. One on FIFA, the other one on DC. Let's talk you talk about the economic impact that people have in these cities and what's your message to the mayors to get their cities prepared, not only the beautification process but also the safety aspect? Well, Los Angeles is an example. You know, it's poorly run. We have a mayor there that can't even get permits to the people that lost their houses. Lee Zeldin got every permit. The hardest permit is the federal permit. Within 20 days, every single permit was there for the people to build their houses. But people are writing us in there saying they won't give us the mayor is incompetent, the governor is incompetent. Ago, I know Gavin very well. He's an incompetent guy with a good line of bullsh*t and he doesn't get the job done. And frankly, those people want to build a house. It's just terrible. They could have been built. Some of them could have been built already. But think of it, the federal government that has the most complex part and it's the most complex environmental thing to do. We got it. Everybody had it within 30 days, and they're not even close to getting their permits. And now they're talking about taking some of those sites and building a low income housing on them. These are high end neighborhoods, and I'm all for low income housing. I built a lot of low income housing I know all about to 36. I know every program that there is in the government. I used every one of them. I know more about low income housing than probably almost anybody. And it's great. It's fine, it's wonderful. But you don't build it in Pacific Palisades. You don't build it there and you don't build it in the other areas that burned down. So they're talking about putting up low income housing and you talk about riots. They're going to have riots if that happens because you're taking the people's property away. They want to build their houses and they're unable to get permits from the mayor and from the governor. And that's a terrible thing. But and let me tell you, if I didn't send in the troops in Los Angeles, Johnny wouldn't be in Los Angeles. You wouldn't be having your World Cup there. I sent the troops and we kept it. And even the police commissioner, the sheriff and the police commissioner, they all said the same thing. They said we could have never handled what was happening. You saw the. You were there. He said we could have never handled weapons. And then you hear Gavin Newsom, after it's all Quell here, Newsom got up and said, We could have done this by himself. Now they couldn't. And if they could have, I would have taken the chancellor. Okay. My second question is on crime prevention. Would you be open to expanding the national concealed carry to apply to D.C. like it does in other states like Texas? Yeah, well, they have it in some states and they feel strongly about it. I you know, as you know, I'm in favor of it. People have to protect themselves. I'm a Second Amendment person. Very simply, people have to be able to protect themselves, especially like in Washington. You walk down the street, a guy comes up and slug. He's got to he's got a pistol in his hand. You can be tough. You're going to be in great shape. You can be a powerful person or you can be a guy that weighs \u00a3100 with a gun in your hand. And I'll I'll bet on the guy with a gun 100% of the time. Right. And so you need protection. So I'm a Second Amendment person all the way up to President Trump, who said this morning that you want in Congress to get $2 billion to help clean up D.C.. Have you had any conversations with Mike Johnson and John Thune about where they're going to get that money? Which money? You said this morning we're going to get $2 billion from Congress. How clean up? Yeah, I've spoken to Mike Johnson. I've spoken to John Thune, the Senate House. And I think it's going to be very easy to get. It's it's going to be not a lot of money. I wouldn't even know where to spend the number that you mentioned, But it's going to be money to beautify the city. And they're ready. Everybody wants to save D.C. In one way, it's easiest. The violence was more than any other city in the country, actually, by far. It may have been more than any other city in the world, if you could think. You know, we looked at some of the worst cities in the world. It was worse. And that's why it angers me to see the mayors saying about how they have it on the side, not on this. It was worse than ever. Yeah, we have no problem getting that money. That money will come out of Congress. I think it'll be even bipartisan. I mean, I would imagine Democrats would vote for that one. It's the plan to get it before the September 30 spending deadline on the Hill. Well, I don't know if there is a headline, a deadline, because if I declare a national emergency, which this was, that ends the deadline. So, I mean, I keep saying about a 30 day deadline of which we have 22 days left or something. But if I think we're in great shape here, that's one thing. But I don't I'm going to just say it's a it's a national emergency. And if I have a national emergency, I can keep the troops there as long as I want. And people are not going to want to have the troops at 30 days. You know, it's one thing to get them out. It's another thing to keep them out for a long period of time. You've got to train people. You can't do this. You can't pop people over the head. And a lot of those people are in courts right now going to court. They're going to go to jail for a long time. So that's going to take more than 30 days. But if I have to declare a national emergency, which I don't think got to do. Yeah. Mr. President, we're going to recognize that in two weeks. You'll know whether you go. Yeah, I think I know. I think I know the attitude of Russia and frankly, of Ukraine. It takes two. What are the two ways you can go at the end of two weeks then? Well, then I'm going to make a decision as to what we do are and it's going to be a it's going to be a very important decision. And that's whether or not it's massive sanctions or massive tariffs about or do we do nothing and say it's your fight? Look, I would have never been in this war if I were president. You wouldn't have. You wouldn't have had. This was never going to happen. This was caused by stupid people that fought for it. And, you know, people say, well, how do we know? Because for four years it was never even a subject. And Vladimir knew. And you see his picture right here was they said he said, but Vladimir knew very strongly. We wouldn't have stood for it. It wouldn't have happened. 100% wouldn't have happened. But it did happen. And now they're losing from 5 to 7 young kids thinking that you're a parent and your son is leaving. He's Russian or he's Ukrainian and he's leaving and they waving goodbye. Nice, beautiful kid, nice true cut. All said he wants to be a soldier and goes to his first week. He has his head blown off and he's no different than you people. Me. And it doesn't matter where. I mean, I said I solved the problem in the Congo. That was vicious. Rwanda in the Congo, the Republic of the Congo. And they were fighting for 31 years. And it was machetes. People were getting their heads chopped off that was going on for 31 years, I got to tell you. So they came to the White House. We signed an agreement. It was amazing. People can't believe we got it done. I love to stop killing. I really do. People people thought it would be just the opposite. Hillary Clinton said, oh, he'll get us into a war. No, I'm getting everybody else out of wars. Are you saying? And that if you do nothing, if if, if Putin doesn't come to the table for a ceasefire, I'll see whose fault it is. If there are reasons why I understand that, I know exactly what I'm doing. We're going to see whether or not they have a meeting. That'll be interesting to see. And if they don't, why didn't they have a meeting? Because I told them to have a meeting. But I'll know in two weeks what what I'm going to do. I'm pretty good at. The Justice Department is also sending the X Files over to the House Oversight Committee today. Are you are you in support of them releasing, keeping it open if they want to? Some people shouldn't be hurt, but I'm in support of keeping it totally open. I couldn't care less. You got a lot of people that it could be mentioned in those files. They don't deserve to be people because he knew everybody in Palm Beach. I don't know anything about that. But I have said to Pam and everybody else, give them everything you can give them, because it's a it's a Democrat hoax. It's just a hoax. The whole Epstein thing is a Democrat hoax. So we had the greatest six months, seven months in the history of the presidency, and the Democrats don't know what to do. So they keep bringing up that stuff, but it affected them. The Bill Clinton was on his plane and went to the island supposedly 28 times. I don't want to bring that up, frankly. You have, Larry, whatever his name is, Summers, the head of Harvard, who is Jeffrey Epstein's best friend. Nobody ever talks about that. I mean, I but I don't want to hurt Larry Summers. But he was best friends with Jeffrey Epstein. Now, this is a Democratic hopes to try and get the the significance of what we've done over the past seven months. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They say it's number one in history what we've done, including stopping seven wars. I mean, just include that. And now you look and now you look at the stock market today, it's way up to start off with from where I took it. And this market was going to crash. If Joe Biden or Kamala were president, this market would have we would have had a crash like in 1929. You're not going to have that. It's only a question of how high is it going to go. You know, I had the strongest economy in the history of our country. And despite COVID, we had the strongest economy in the history of our country, and we're going to blow it away this time. I was always going to make it a lot of money. And whether it was from myself or whether I like doing it this way better, I mean, I like I like make it for the country. Our country has been ripped off by friend and foe nations all over the world ripped off. And the French have been much worse than the folks for the most part, and they're not ripping us off. We just signed a deal with the European Union. They're paying us essentially $950 billion like a signing fee. They're going to buy $750 billion worth of energy. They were buying much of our energy there, and they're very smart in doing it. And as you know, Ursula was here a couple of days ago, having to deal with the people, the leaders that we had. We had a great people said they've never seen anything like it. Well, we had the leaders of Europe right here in the Oval Office, and she's so happy that she has an agreement. But people aren't ripping us anymore. They're we're run by this country is run by smart people now. Mr. President, in Israel, the question is, what is that entail? Within reports that you considering take taken into account about the 10%, but the 10%? I met a man who was a very nice man and I called for his removal because I saw something by a man named Tom Cotton. A senator from Arkansas is a great guy, friend of mine, supporter of mine, big supporter of his, too. And he wrote a pretty nasty story about the head of Intel. And I said, well, that's right, he should resign. And he came in. He saw me. We talked for a while. I liked him a lot. I thought he was very good. I thought he was somewhat a victim. But, you know, nobody is a total victim, I guess. And I said, you know what? I think the United States should be given 10% of intel. And he said, I would consider that. I said, Well, I'd like you to do that, because it just being left behind, as you know, compared to Jensen and some of our friends and video, some of the people and the people, and because Intel should have never been, Intel was the biggest, most powerful chip company in the world. And then they started leaving and they started going to foreign countries, in particular Taiwan. And if we had a president would have said, okay, you can go to Taiwan, but we're going to put a 100% tariff or 200 or 300 or 500% tariff. Anybody that sells into the United States has to pay. They wouldn't have left. They would have never left, and we would have. So in the meantime, we had people that were, in some cases good politicians that weren't good on trade. I loved that man, but he was not good on trade. I totally disagree. He allowed the car industry to be taken out of this country. We lost 50% of our car industry, but that's all coming back. It's all coming back. But if somebody would have said that with Intel, would be a giant right now. Now, with that, they've had some bad management over the years and and they got lost. And I said, I think you should pay us 10% of your company. And they said, yes, that's about 0 billion for the I don't get it. This comes to the United States of America. And I said, I think it would be good having the United States is your partner. He agreed and they've agreed to do it. And I think it's a great deal for them, and I think it's a great deal. He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us 0 billion to the United States. So we picked up 10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that. I'll do more of them. If somebody has like we have restrictive covenants with Johnson, we have that's invidious and too unrestricted government and nothing to do with losing our our powers or military or anything because that I wouldn't do. But there are things you can do that don't affect us, that actually help us. And if we're going to give somebody a free out, a restricted covenant, we have a strong restrictive covenant on certain industries and I will absolutely give somebody a opening going to restrict to do a lot of business, which is good for us as long as it doesn't hurt us in a security or military way. And if I do that, I think the country should be paid because anybody else, I have it in real estate where I'll have a deal with somebody and I'll have them restrictive covenants and they'll come back and they'll say, I'd love to be able to build over here, but I'm not allowed to because you have be covered. You have me restricted. I shall let you build over there, but pay me a lot of money. No different but to come to country never did it because the country was run by foolish people. Like you said Chicago, in my opinion. How good are you making? Have there been concrete steps that the administration has taken to do that over other cities? I haven't spoken to these grossly incompetent. I haven't spoken to the mayor. Know when we're ready, we'll go in and we'll straighten out Chicago just like we did DC. Chicago is very dangerous. Great place. I built great stuff there. I have a I have the most beautiful building in Chicago, I think, but I hate to see what's happened to Chicago. Chicago is our greatest city. Actually. Bob Kisch, a great friend of mine, passed away. I used to own the Giants, very successful Lowes, he said Chicago. I think he had the main office in Chicago. He said, Chicago and San Francisco are the two greatest cities in the world. Now you look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco. They've destroyed it. I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco. And, you know, it's just different. We can clean that up to clean that one up. Do you know if we if everything works out and we've already had calls from other cities, quite close calls from Democrats, we'd love you to come here because they've lost control of themselves. You know, I'm not going to say because I don't want them to lose their elections. But we've had calls from Democrats and calls from people generally. We'd love you to come here because we'll straighten out the problem President Trump has in Israel. The families of hostages in Israel, the families of hostages are opposed to the reoccupying of Gaza. Why is the US? Well, not all of them. And you have to understand, I'm the one that got all of the hostages out. You got a lot of people out. If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be out. I worked with Bibi and I worked with Steve Whittaker, but it wasn't for me. You would have all these hostages would most likely be dead right now, every one of them. So they all come up here. They all come in groups of ten, 12, 13, and many of them and I've gotten to know a lot of them. They're great people. What they had to go through is incredible. But so now they have 20. But the 20 is actually probably not 20 because a couple maybe aren't around any longer. It's a terrible thing. No, I like I don't like anymore, I said. You know, when you get down to 20, they're not going to make deals anymore. And they did. And then I put out a statement, as you know, that was a tough statement. Go in and get them. And they said, we'll give you ten. We'll give you ten. I don't know what Israel's doing, but they were willing now immediately to give us another ten. The situation has to end. It's extortion and it has to end. And we'll see what happens. I actually think they're safer in many ways. If you went in and you really went in fast and you did it and people can't forget October 7th, remember that I'm friendly with all groups. I won the Arab vote in Michigan. I did so great with the Arab vote. Remember, I started off with zero. I ended up winning. I wouldn't say the candidate was the greatest, but I would have won against anybody. They are great people, but we have to do things properly. And, you know, I'm very proud to say I got the hostages out. You have hundreds of people that are living now because of me. And now we have that final little group of people. And Hamas knows that if they give them, that's probably the end of their lives. So it's not easy to get. And I know if you're a parent, you just don't care. You want I want my baby back. They want their babies back. They want their kids back. And I understand. But I got him out and do a good job. And we'll be doing everything we can to get the hostages out. Thank you all very much. Lisa Jackson, host Jay Powell today said it even suggested that they might cut interest rates where they are. Well, we call them too late for a reason. You should have got them a year ago is too late. You know, we have a stock market that's up a thousand points today. I better be careful because I go out there and I see it's down a thousand, but it's up a thousand points when I came in here. We have a country that markets the hottest it's ever been. The country is better than it's ever been. We have a military that I rebuilt largely in my first term. We had a great successful first term. But this is going to be even better. But we rebuilt it. We gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan, but relatively small compared to the overall. But I think it was the most embarrassing day and period in the history of our country that they allowed us 13 wonderful people. But it's really hundreds of people were killed and they don't talk about the 48 that were so severely wounded with no legs, no arms, no, don't nobody ever mentions them except me. But that was the worst day, the most. It just showed how incompetent, frankly, that didn't happen. I really believe that you might not have had the problem with Russia. I think Putin was sitting there watching these stupid people running our country and said, this is the time to invade. It's, you know, this is the time. And then Biden made the statement, well, he can do a small incursion when he said that it was off to the races. Right. When he said he can do a small incursion. Remember that? I was surprised they knew the word incursion. I need to get back to my vocabulary. I want to thank everybody. It's very important to me and to everybody up here, the World Cup. And Johnny has been so incredible. I mean, he's really a great leader. I mean, do you think I said, Johnny, do it by phone. You don't have to come. No, he said, I'll come. I'll come. And he flew all night long to be here and listen to this about how great we're doing in DC. But he's a fantastic leader and this will be your most successful World Cup ever. Thank you. Thank you.
