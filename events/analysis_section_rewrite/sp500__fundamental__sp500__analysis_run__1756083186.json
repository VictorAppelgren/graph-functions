      "feedback": "This draft does a solid job linking tariff policy to Ford as a macro proxy, but to reach world‑class, you need a tighter, first‑principles, multi‑year framework and explicit, source‑driven quantification. Key gaps: (1) regime mapping and transition conditions are missing. Translate the horizon into (a) baseline tariff/autarky regime, (b) escalatory/China‑tilted regime, (c) policy‑pivot regime (domestic chip/EV insulation), and (d) geopolitical shock regime; specify what would trigger transitions between them and with what probability, drawing clearly on SGB2PAZGK for tariff contours and the India/China dynamics, and on 65UUBU0OR and 22PL3Q360 for Ford’s fundamentals. (2) First‑principles anchors are underdeveloped. Ground the analysis in invariant channels (real rate/monetary stance, terms of trade from tariff belts, productivity and capex multipliers from reshoring/AI data‑center buildouts, and BoP implications of a domestic‑driven supply chain). Map how those invariants transmit to Ford’s cash flows and to equity pricing. (3) Catalysts, triggers, and invalidation points need specificity and timing. List concrete catalysts (tariff deadlines, baseline vs. escalated rates, Nvidia export rules or chip‑policy shifts, progress on US chip fabs/energy backbone) and invalidate points (e.g., EV profitability turning positive, or a policy relapse that re‑accelerates offshoring) with explicit thresholds. (4) Quantification and sourcing discipline: replace generalities with numbers drawn from the sources you cite. For Ford, anchor to: EV segment loss (about $1.3B in Q2), operating margin (4.3%), ROIC (10.1%), dividend yield (≈5.18%), forward P/E (~10.3), and 17% YTD in 2025, contrasting with S&P 500 history. For tariffs, present ranges without asserting a single level: baseline 10% with China facing much higher rates, plus mentioned arguments around 34%, 145%, and the 80% figure as scenario endpoints; assign conditional probabilities rather than treating them as fixed realities. (5) Citations and conflicts: raise density to include SGB2PAZGK for tariff framing and Ford pieces (65UUBU0OR, 22PL3Q360) for Ford’s fundamentals, and explicitly reconcile conflicts (e.g., disparate tariff levels) by presenting them as scenario inputs with sources in parentheses after each figure. (6) Structure and style aligned to SECTION FOCUS: present a base case, multiple regimes with transition conditions, catalysts, and invalidation; end with watchlist and confidence, but keep the prose lean and citation‑scarce to IDs only. Actionable edits: reorganize into a multi‑year regime map with explicit triggers; insert first‑principles anchors and a formal causal chain from policy to Ford’s cash flows to market pricing; quantify every pivotal assumption with source numbers (and ranges where applicable); annotate every assertion with IDs (SGB2PAZGK, 65UUBU0OR, 22PL3Q360, and any other critical source you rely on); clearly separate base case, upside/downside scenarios, and invalidation points; and replace broad statements with precise, testable signals (e.g., tariff deadlines, capex milestones, EV profitability inflection, and Ford’s Model E cadence) to sharpen decision usefulness.",
