  "content": "Digital payments solution provider Fintiv is accusing Apple of racketeering and trade-secret theft in a new federal suit over the technology that powers Apple Pay.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nFintiv\u2019s complaint, lodged Wednesday (Aug. 6) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that Apple posed as a prospective partner a decade ago to gain inside access to CorFire\u2019s (now Fintiv\u2019s) mobile-wallet platform.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2012, Apple engineers allegedly sat through multiple NDA-protected technical sessions, only to hire key CorFire personnel and roll the stolen know-how into the 2014 launch of Apple Pay.\n\nThe filing claims Apple\u2019s secure-element design, NFC implementation and trusted-service-management layer are \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of Fintiv\u2019s proprietary architecture, helping Apple Pay become a multibillion-dollar revenue engine.\n\nThe suit invoked both federal and Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statutes.\n\nFintiv said Apple erected a \u201cfence\u201d by forming an \u201cassociation-in-fact enterprise\u201d with issuing banks and card networks; the enterprise purportedly processes trillions of dollars in Apple Pay transactions each year, monetizing Fintiv\u2019s trade secrets at a massive scale.\n\nThe complaint portrayed the dispute as part of a broader Apple playbook, citing similar trade-secret rows with HealthTech firms Masimo and Valencell to suggest a pattern of \u201cpartner, poach and profit.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s theft of Fintiv\u2019s technology is part of a pattern and practice \u2026 falsely pretending to partner with companies in order to steal confidential and proprietary information \u2026 all in order to steal the company\u2019s valuable intellectual property and use it to commercialize the business on its own,\u201d the complaint stated.\n\nAs examples, the complaint cited \u201ca similar pernicious scheme\u201d to steal trade secrets from Masimo Corp. \u201cwhich had developed non-invasive technology related to blood oxygen monitoring which Apple believed was key to overcoming performance issues with its Apple watch.\u201d\n\nApple, it is alleged, perpetrated a similar scheme against a biotech company named Valencell Inc., where it entered into discussions and negotiations under the guise of seeking to license Valencell\u2019s active heart-monitoring technology. Apple\u2019s alleged scheme was \u2014 as with Fintiv and Masimo \u2014 not to partner or license with Valencell, \u201cbut to steal Valencell\u2019s technology and incorporate it into Apple\u2019s products, which Apple then marketed and sold on its own without paying a nickel to Valencell,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nApple has not yet issued a public response; the company typically declines comment on pending litigation, but is expected to move for dismissal. Investors shrugged \u2014 Apple shares closed up 0.4% Thursday (Aug. 7) \u2014 yet payments insiders say the suit could rekindle scrutiny of Apple Pay\u2019s alleged \u201ctax\u201d on card issuers and networks.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first suit Fintiv has filed against Apple. A Texas court this week dismissed a related patent infringement suit, according to Reuters.",

In addition, RICO provides for severer penalties and permits a defendant to be convicted and separately punished for both the underlying crimes that constitute the pattern of racketeering activity and for a substantive violation of RICO. Finally, injunctive relief provisions allow for the prohibition of further involvement with the labor organization of the convicted racketeering associates. Thus, RICO provides an effective method both for establishing the existence of organized crime's penetration into labor unions and for excising corrupt union officials from positions of leadership. The deterrent power of RICO enforcement over time should produce a more viable, democratically elected union leadership. 82 footnotes."
