  "title": "Two subscription-free smart rings were just banned in the US - here's why",
  "description": "Oura's biggest smart ring rivals were caught infringing on its form factor patent, and will no longer be available to purchase come October.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\u2022 The two competitors infringed on form factor patents, the ITC ruled on Aug. 21.\n\u2022 Ultrahuman and RingConn smart rings can no longer be sold in the US.\n\nOura secured a final legal victory in its patent dispute with Ultrahuman and RingConn last week. The US International Trade Commission's ruling asserts that the two competing smart ring brands infringed on Oura's patents to develop smart rings of their own.\n\nThe ITC issued cease-and-desist orders banning the two brands from importing and selling their smart rings in the US. This narrows the smart ring market's competition, taking two major competitors out of the game and giving Oura even more dominance in the wearables space.\n\nAlso: I compared the two best Android smartwatches right now - here's how Google wins\n\nThe cease-and-desist order takes effect 60 days after the decision's August 21 publication, and its submission to the Office of the US Trade Representatives, which an Oura spokesperson said is expected this week.\n\n\"This ruling establishes at the most rigorous levels of review that \u014cura's patents are valid and enforceable, and reinforces not only the strength of \u014cura's patents but our long-term IP strategy,\" Oura writes in a blog post.\n\nThe initial ITC determination came in April and claimed that both brands engaged in dishonest tactics to develop the form factor of their smart rings.\n\nWhen ZDNET requested comment on the initial determination several months ago, an Oura spokesperson said that both products infringe on \"every element of every asserted claim of Oura's patent.\"\n\nAlso: I've tested the Apple Watch, Oura Ring, and other sleep trackers - 5 tips to get the best results\n\nThe two competing smart ring brands were known as subscription-free alternatives to the higher-priced Oura Ring, a device whose latest generation begins at $350, alongside an additional $7 monthly membership fee for full access to data capture.\n\nIn response to the ITC's ruling, Ultrahuman said, \"We are moving forward with confidence and doubling down on compliance while accelerating development of a next-generation ring built on a fundamentally new architecture. As many observers recognize, restricting competition risks fewer choices, higher prices, and slower innovation.\" Ultrahuman added that consumers can still purchase the Ring Air directly through Oct. 21.\n\nRingConn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ITC made the ruling on Aug. 21. On that same day, Ultrahuman announced it would be taking Oura to court in India, alleging that the smart ring brand infringed on its patents for its sensors, construction, and onboard process, according to a press release.\n\nAlso: The best smart rings: I tested and found an obvious winner\n\nUltrahuman's and RingConn's smart rings are still available to purchase on select retailers like Amazon, but they will probably be closing up shop in the US very soon, now that the ruling is confirmed and cease-and-desist orders have been instituted.",

After a long day of work, nerve-inducing headlines, and strenuous exercise, all I want is sleep.\nThat's when the lyrics of Hall and Oates' song, \"When the Morning Comes,\" a tune mainly about rejection that can be interpreted as an ode to a good night's rest, come to mind: \"It'll be all right when the morning comes,\" the duo sing. As a sleep enthusiast, I can't help but agree.\nAlso: New FDA-cleared blood pressure monitor delivers medical grade results at home\nAs a health and wearables editor, I wear smartwatches and smart rings around the clock. By testing these products, my interest in optimizing my sleep and health has grown. Not to brag, but I'm amazing at sleeping -- my roommates jokingly refer to me as the Sleepytime Tea Bear. I treat my sleep the same way a professional athlete treats their workout routine, and it's paying dividends.\nMy sleep scores reach the high eighties and low nineties consistently, and I get around eight hours -- the expert-recommended daily sleep dose -- every night. My focus is clear and my energy is long-lasting.\nIf you want to level up your sleep scores, I've consulted experts from wearables specialists, such as Oura and Whoop, and drawn on my own experience using these products and witnessing my sleep results to compile a list of tips I swear by for better slumber.\n1. Consistency is key\nIn early January, I caught a sinus infection that kept me bedridden for nearly two weeks. To get better, I would go to bed early -- around 8pm. At the beginning, when sleep was dire, I would head off to bed at 9pm; by the tail end of my recovery, I would head off at 10pm. As I became more of a stickler for my sleep times, I would wake up at 6:30am every morning -- no alarm needed.\nWhile I wish I didn't have to endure two weeks of antibiotics, hacking coughs, and blowing my nose to develop an unwavering wake-up time, I'm thankful I got to reconfigure my circadian rhythms to a 6am wake-up time that works for me. I rise earlier, go to work earlier, come home and exercise earlier, and, most importantly, go to bed earlier. It's great. This pattern is in line with the recommendation of Raphael Vallat, Oura's lead machine learning data scientist -- go to sleep and wake up at the same time seven days a week.\nAlso: I tried a new anti-stress browser to see if it could really help me relax - and it actually works\n\"Quality sleep isn't just about time in bed -- it's about consistency and efficiency. A stable nighttime routine and an ideal sleep environment play a crucial role in optimizing rest,\" a Whoop spokesperson wrote in an email.\n2. How low can your heart rate go?\nDuring sleep, your heart rate will drop lower than your daytime resting heart rate to recover from the day's activities and stress. Your resting heart rate should lower during the first half of your night's sleep -- though it may rise during REM, Oura explains in a blog post. The earlier in the night your heart rate lowers, the easier it is for your body to recover and for you to wake up fresh and alert.\nExercising late, consuming caffeine well into the afternoon, drinking alcohol, eating a heavy meal before bed, or doing stress-inducing tasks, like scrolling the news or arguing with a partner, can all impact your body's stress levels, keep you up at night, or inhibit an early heart rate drop.\nI've noticed that my heart rate lowers earlier in the night when I've read before bed or avoided drinking or eating late. On nights when I've been out with friends, received stressful news, or had a glass of wine before bed, my heart rate reaches its lowest later in the night, and my readiness or sleep scores are poor.\nAlso: Unfocused? This new fitness device aims to get your brain back into shape\nOura's Vallat offered additional wind-down tips ahead of bedtime. He recommends dimming the lights -- \"or even better, turn them off\" -- at least an hour before bedtime to promote melatonin production that, in turn, causes your heart rate to lower. \"It's also important to get some time at the end of the day to reprocess (i.e. think about) the events of the day -- otherwise your brain is going to do it anyway when you're trying to sleep,\" he wrote in an email to ZDNET. Meditation, journaling, or a warm bath can help with this rumination.\n3. Ditch alcoholic drinks and heavy meals before bed\nThose 8pm dinners are taking a toll on your sleep. Eating and drinking before bedtime is a major culprit for that bad sleep score.\nAlcohol can promote drowsiness and send you to sleep easier, but the sleep you get after a few drinks is of poorer quality than a sober night of rest. Consuming a drink or two before bedtime can suppress your REM cycles and keep you in lighter sleep stages for longer, according to the National Council on Aging.\nAlso: The best sleep trackers\nAvoiding late-night snacking, caffeine, and alcohol are some of the most effective nighttime practices, according to Whoop data. If you are having a drink, experts recommend having your last one three hours before bedtime, says the Sleep Foundation.\n4. Save your nights for yourself\nIf it was up to me, I'd go to bed at 10pm every night. When I get a free day to myself, this is normally when I'm shutting my eyes and falling asleep. But if I spent every night alone, I'd be sad and isolated from my friends and family, who regularly schedule things late in the day to catch up. Don't forget that a healthy social life contributes to a healthy and happy lifestyle.\nThat's why I've started prioritizing weekend and early afternoon hangouts to see people, instead of trying to cram my evenings with dinners or drinks that keep me out late, far away from my bed. I prefer meeting up for breakfast or lunch on weekends, when drinking, which I try to avoid in excess, is less commonplace than your average dinner or late-night bar outing. This strategy keeps my evenings open for an early, peaceful, undeterred wind-down.\n5. Your sleep is only as good as your environment\nMy bedroom overlooks a noisy and bright Brooklyn street that never sleeps, even while I'm trying to. However, that situation doesn't stop me from achieving great rest.\nThat's because the environment I've created for myself dims the brightness of the streetlights and silences the car honks and ambulance sirens outside my window. I can thank two helpers for that: my sleep mask and my sleep earplugs. I picked a sleep mask from Target that's thick and soft and covers my eyes completely to block light.\nAlso: These $50 sleep earplugs replaced my $300 sleep earbuds\nAs far as sleep earplugs go, I recommend the Loop Dream earplugs, which are comfortable, light, unobtrusive, and can silence the many noises outside my window. Suppose you'd like to listen to ambient noise, audiobooks, or music before falling asleep. I'd recommend the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which I have tested myself and can without a doubt recommend for comfort and quality.\nMaybe sticking something in your ears isn't the equation for a smooth slumber? If that's the case, use a speaker or a sleep machine to play white noise instead.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

There are effective means to treat high blood pressure, but it's not always easy to detect and monitor.\nBlood pressure watches offer a convenient, non-invasive way to keep track of your cardiovascular health on the go so you can consult with your healthcare provider. YHE offers a very accurate assortment of blood pressure watches starting at just $129, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is at the high end with a price of $425. Whether you're managing hypertension, staying proactive about your wellness, or simply curious about your vital stats, these innovative smartwatches combine style, functionality, and accuracy.\nWhat is the best blood pressure watch you can buy right now?\nTo help you find the top smartwatch that functions as a blood pressure monitoring tool, we found studies from doctors evaluating the best commercially available blood pressure watches, keeping in mind accuracy, data privacy, and price. We also tested a few of the watches and compared the watch readings to blood pressure cuffs mounted on the arm.\nThe best blood pressure that you can purchase for the US market is the YHE BP Doctor Fit, which is one of the few wearables available that captures your blood pressure using an inflatable cuff around the wrist. Read on to see how all of the available blood pressure watch options compare.\nAlso: Best Android smartwatches: Expert tested\nThe best blood pressure watches of 2025\nWhy we like it: The YHE BP Doctor Fit promises medical-grade accuracy in measuring blood pressure, and after testing it for a few weeks, we can confirm that is a valid promise. The key is the watch's patented inflatable air cuff, which detects blood pressure fluctuations. You can measure your blood pressure at any time, and the watch has a host of other features, including typical activity tracking and sleep tracking.\nReview: I tried the $129 blood pressure watch, and it came close to my Withings and Garmin trackers\nWho it's for: If you need to capture your blood pressure easily throughout the day, the BP Doctor Fit is a great option. The watch's heart rate monitor tracks your heart rate continuously, 24 hours a day. The YHE BP Doctor Fit is a full-range smartwatch with sleep, activity, and health tracking, along with alarms, messages, and weather. You can sync your data to the Android or iOS app and create a health management plan that includes your whole family.\nWe were surprised by the low price given the solid build quality, vibrant AMOLED display, long battery life, blood pressure monitoring capability, and functional smartphone application. There is no support for third-party apps, but all of the basics you need are there to function as a daily wear smartwatch.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you are looking for a watch that provides GPS activity tracking and extensive app support, you should consider a Galaxy Watch. However, if you want the most accurate blood pressure readings in a watch form factor, then this is the one for you.\nYHE BP Doctor Fit features: BP measurement: Inflatable cuff | Size: 48 x 39 x 13 mm | Weight: 60 g | Power source: Rechargeable lithium-ion battery | Battery Life: 10 days | App: For both iPhone and Android\nWhy we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is an internationally popular wearable that can measure your blood pressure. The Galaxy Watch 7 measures blood pressure and, using the watch's built-in health monitor app, takes ECG readings as well. However, Samsung does\nReview: Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: Which Android smartwatch is best for you?\nWho it's for: The watch is packed with other features, including sleep tracking and music streaming, and it also made ZDNET's list of the best smartwatches. It shows particular promise in monitoring existing conditions. A\nThe blood pressure function has not yet received FDA approval in the US, but it is available in at least 50 other countries, including Canada, Vietnam, and South Africa. (If you are in the US and still want to use the feature without FDA clearance, you can find unofficial workarounds online to do so.) To ensure accurate readings, users must calibrate their watches monthly with a traditional blood pressure cuff.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you are in the US and do not want to \"hack\" your watch to enable blood pressure support, then the Galaxy Watch 7 is not going to help you monitor your blood pressure. The YHE BP Doctor Fit is best for that task.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7 features: BP measurement: Pulse wave analysis | Size: 40mm and 44mm | Weight: 28.8 and 33.8 grams | Power source: Rechargeable lithium-ion battery | Battery life: Three days on a single charge | App: Galaxy Wearable\nWhy we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a unique square design with a round watch face, an interesting magnetic lug system, three buttons on one side, gesture support, advanced running dynamics, and more. Samsung's Galaxy AI is present in the form of wellness insights that combine into a daily score to help guide you to optimal performance, including healthy sleep levels.\nThe Watch Ultra runs the Samsung-powered Google Wear OS 5.0 with One UI Watch 6.0, meaning it still looks like a Samsung smartwatch but also supports Google Assistant, Google Maps, Google Wallet, Google Play Store, and more Google apps.\nReview: I've tested dozens of smartwatches, but I'm wearing the Galaxy Ultra Watch long-term\nWho it's for: The Watch Ultra has an operating system optimized for the round watch design with a virtual rotating bezel. Fall detection, messaging, phone calls, and more are available on the watch, with advanced fitness data such as VO2 Max and advanced running dynamics data also supported. If you have large wrists, spend lots of time exploring the outdoors, or want a rugged, long-battery-life Wear OS watch, then the Galaxy Watch Ultra is for you.\nLike the Galaxy Watch 7, the blood pressure function has not yet received FDA approval in the US, but it is available in at least 50 other countries, including Canada, Vietnam, and South Africa. (If you are in the US and still want to use the feature without FDA clearance, you can find unofficial workarounds online to do so.) Again, to ensure accurate readings, users must calibrate their watches monthly with a traditional blood pressure cuff.\nWho should look elsewhere: Again, if you are in the US and do not want to \"hack\" your watch to enable blood pressure support, then the Galaxy Watch Ultra is not going to help you monitor your blood pressure. The YHE BP Doctor Fit is best for that task.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra features: BP measurement: Pulse wave analysis | Size: 47mm | Weight: 60.5 grams | Power source: Rechargeable lithium-ion battery | Battery life: Three days on a single charge | App: Galaxy Wearable\nWhy we like it: Emerging tech can be expensive, and given the blood pressure wearable market is still emerging, it's rare to find models for under $100 -- so we had to share this option from FitVII. At the time of writing, this watch is only $45 on Amazon and has a 4-star rating from over 4,700 reviewers who say they are impressed with the reading consistency and app's user-friendly interface.\nWho it's for: Along with a more affordable blood pressure tracking function, this watch tracks sleep, analyzing the time you've spent in deep sleep or light sleep. It tracks your activity and gives you the weather in real time, as well as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen tracking on its 1.7-inch HD screen. Additionally, it has a 7- to 10-day battery life.\nThe FitVII website also sells the GT5 watch with 24/7 heart rate and blood pressure monitoring for around $100.\nAlso: Best cheap smartwatches 2025\nWho should look elsewhere: If you have high blood pressure and want to monitor trends, you should consider spending a bit more to buy an accurate one like the YHE BP Doctor Fit rather than saving a few bucks on this one that compromises in too many ways.\nFitVII Smartwatch features: BP measurement: Sensors | Size: 1.7 inches | Weight: 1.2 oz (34.02 g) | Power source: Rechargeable lithium-ion battery | Battery life: 7+ days | App: FitCloudPro App\nWhy we like it: For those who want a blood pressure watch without having to connect your data to a smartphone or an app, the Med-Watch Pro is a great option. It houses all your health data in the device itself. If you do want to connect it to your smartphone, the DaFit app provides more helpful insights and personal recommendations based on your data.\nWho it's for: The Med-Watch Pro measures your blood pressure using an optical sensor to detect blood flow beneath the skin. More specifically, a technique called photoplethysmography (PPG) allows the watch to emit light into the skin and measure changes in light absorption to calculate blood pressure. It takes only 30 seconds or less to get a blood pressure reading.\nIn addition to blood pressure, the Med-Watch Pro measures heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, daily steps, and more for overall health tracking.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you have high blood pressure and want to monitor trends, you should consider spending about the same to buy an accurate and proven model like the YHE BP Doctor Fit rather than purchasing one using less accurate technology.\nMed-Watch Pro tech specs: BP measurement: Optical sensors | Size: Adjustable strap (5.5-8.5 inches) | Weight: N/A | Power source: Rechargeable battery | Battery life: Up to a week | App: DaFit app\nBlood pressure watches compared\n| Blood pressure watch | Price | How does it work? | Weight | Power source |\n| YHE BP Doctor Fit | $129 | Inflatable cuff | 2.12 oz | Rechargeable lithium-ion battery |\n| Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 | $300 and $330 | Pulse wave analysis, monthly calibration with traditional blood pressure cuff | 1.0 and 1.19 oz | Rechargeable lithium-ion battery |\n| Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra | $425 | Pulse wave analysis, monthly calibration with traditional blood pressure cuff | 2.1 oz | Rechargeable lithium-ion battery |\n| FitVII Smartwatch | $45 | Sensors | 1.2 oz | Rechargeable lithium-ion battery |\n| Med-Watch Pro | $150 | Optical sensors | N/A | Rechargeable battery |\nWhich is the right blood pressure watch for you?\n| Choose this blood pressure watch\u2026 | If you want\u2026 |\n| YHE BP Doctor Fit | To measure your blood pressure with medical-grade accuracy.

Here are a few factors to consider, based on our years of experience testing wearables:\n- Capability: The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, and other supported Galaxy Watch models, require that you measure and baseline your blood pressure readings with a certified external monitor and enter that data into the app. The watch then measures the incremental changes from that baseline and provides your blood pressure reading. Other watches in this list use an inflatable cuff to measure your blood pressure directly.\n- Other functions: The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra are full-blown smartwatches that run Google's Wear OS, but other watches in this list focus primarily on capturing your blood pressure and providing you with the time and data. Make sure you check out the functions available in the watch and evaluate whether or not you need more from your blood pressure watch.\n- Fit and comfort: Anyone that has captured their blood pressure reading knows that placement of the blood pressure monitor is important in capturing accurate readings. Thus, the watch you use for your blood pressure should also fit well and be comfortable as you capture your readings. A blood pressure watch is used primarily for convenience and the ability to easily capture your readings throughout the day so comfort and fit are vital to success.\nHow we choose these blood pressure watches\nOne obstacle we ran into when choosing the best blood pressure watches was the lack of options. The concept of a blood pressure watch itself seems to be embraced by many, but we found the execution to be less robust.\nWith few options on the market, it is easy to weed out the fake or unreliable wearables from the legit ones. We took into consideration a few major factors when choosing these best blood pressure watches:\n- Commercial availability: For example, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra still do not have FDA approval in the United States for blood pressure readings, so that feature isn't an option for the US market.\n- Accuracy: We looked at evidence of accuracy from studies and medical research when choosing what blood pressure watches to consider.\n- Data privacy: Health information is extremely important to keep secure with wearables, so we looked into each brand and device's privacy protocols to ensure consumers' health data is safe.\n- Price: We keep price in mind when making our final picks while knowing there aren't many options on the market. However, more economical wearables don't seem as reliable or as focused on data privacy.\nLatest news on blood pressure watches\nSamsung continues to seek FDA approval for its blood pressure monitoring capability, and hopefully someday it will be able to provide this support officially in the US. Rumors indicate that Apple may be working to provide this key functionality in a future Apple Watch. Given the prevalence of high blood pressure in the US, a major smartwatch brand could certainly benefit from providing this capability.\nFAQs on blood pressure watches\nDo blood pressure watches really work?\nWe know, a watch that measures blood pressure sounds like something out of a science fiction novel. Recent advances mean that futuristic wearables are becoming more realistic than ever before. Blood pressure watches that are vetted and tested really do work, but I recommend talking to your doctor before use.\nIn an article featured in IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, Dr. Paolo Bonato, associate professor at Harvard Medical School, identified four areas of focus that are especially important when understanding recent advances in wearables: 1) wearable sensors; 2) wearable systems; 3) signal processing and analysis procedures; and 4) closed-loop systems for adaptive orthoses and prostheses.\nThe first three areas are important in blood pressure monitoring, as sensors and systems feed into analysis and recommendations by doctors. Here's a comprehensive paper on wearable tech in healthcare that Dr. Bonato contributed to for those who want to learn more.\nWhat is stroke level blood pressure?\nAccording to Healthline, the blood pressure range for a hypertension crisis is a systolic number above 180 mm Hg and a diastolic number above 120 mm Hg. Immediate medical attention is required at that level.\nHealthy blood pressure is a reading of less than 120/80 mmHg, while elevated blood pressure ranges from a systolic number of 120-129 mm Hg and a diastolic number of less than 80 mmHg.\nHypertension occurs starting at 130-139/80-89 mmHg. It's good to have an idea of where your blood pressure should fall. Hypertension doesn't result in visible symptoms right away, so it's important to detect and manage it early on.\nDoes the Apple Watch measure blood pressure?\nYou cannot measure blood pressure with an Apple Watch alone. You can link it to a compatible blood pressure monitor and synchronize your blood pressure data to your Apple Watch. The Omron Evolv wireless blood pressure monitor is a compatible device, and the iHealth Feel wireless blood pressure monitor works, too.\nHow accurate is the blood oxygen sensor on the Apple Watch?\nThe blood oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch measures the percentage of oxygen your red blood cells carry from your lungs to the rest of your body. It's an important health metric since it can help you better understand your overall wellness.\nAccording to a 2022 medical study, the measurement of blood oxygen levels (in an Apple Watch Series 6) was not yet up to the medical standard of pulse oximetry; too many of the measurements remain unsuccessful or incorrect. Studies have not been conducted on the most recent Apple Watch models.\n*Important Note: Earlier this year, a US federal judge has ruled that Apple cannot sell its Series 10 and Ultra 2 smartwatches if they have the blood oxygen sensor, due to a patent violation. As a result, a ban was placed on the import of all Apple watches with the feature. Apple Watch users in the US are no longer able to access the blood oxygen monitor app or sensors.\nWhat's a high blood pressure reading?\nHigh blood pressure is equal to or greater than 140 over 90 mmHg, where the top number is a measure of the force in your arteries as your heart beats and pumps blood, and the bottom number is a measure of the force in your arteries as your heart is resting between beats.\nLatest updates\nIn our latest June update, we added in more information about who would benefit from each watch, updated pricing to reflect the most current costs and also provided some thoughts on possible future blood pressure watch availability.\nOther wearables we've tested for health tracking\nFormer ZDNET contributor Sherin Shibu also contributed to this story."

They're both Android smartwatches with AI-powered health coaches, they have around the same battery life, brightness, and storage, and notably, they're the same price.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nOf course, you'll get different watch bands and different brand styles, with Google's watch being slightly bigger, but the bones of these devices are almost identical. Nevertheless, as someone who loves to compare and contrast, I wanted to see how these two smartwatches differ, and which you should buy if you're looking at both.\nSpecifications\nGalaxy Watch 8 | Pixel Watch 4 | |\nBrightness | 3,000 nits | 3,000 nits |\nWeight | 40mm: 30g; 44mm: 40g. | 41mm: 31g; 45mm: 36.7g |\nProcessor | Exynos Core 1000 | Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 |\nMemory | 2GB memory, 32GB storage | 2GB memory, 32GB storage |\nBattery | 30 hours with always-on enabled | 30 on 41mm, 40 hours on 45mm with always-on enabled |\nSizes | 40mm, 44mm | 41mm, 45mm |\nColorways | Graphite, Silver | Matte Black, Polished Silver, Champagne Gold, Satin Moonstone |\nPrice | Starting at $350 | Starting at $350 |\nYou should buy the Google Pixel Watch 4 if...\n1. You're a Google Pixel phone owner\nThis is an obvious one, but if you're a Google Pixel user, you should buy a Pixel Watch, and if you're a Samsung Galaxy user, you should buy a Galaxy Watch. Both Android watches are compatible with either phone brand, but it's often a smoother experience using smartwatch's native device brand.\nAlso: The best smartwatches 2025: I wore these for weeks and found the perfect one for your wrist\n2. You're an outdoor enthusiast\nThe Pixel Watch 4 has a unique satellite feature that separates it from competitors like Samsung. Unlike smartwatches that require a phone's cellular connectivity to initiate satellite communication (like the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra), the Pixel Watch 4 offers standalone satellite communications -- the first of its kind. The feature is available on the Google Pixel Watch 4 LTE.\nAlso: I tried Pixel Watch 4 - and these are my 7 favorite upgrades in Google's new watch\nPowered by the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 processor, it connects to geostationary satellites in the sky without requiring a carrier's additional connection. You can just take your Pixel Watch 4 out into the great outdoors and know that, if an emergency arises, you'll have all the connectivity tools around your wrist to be in touch with an emergency responder and send messages.\n3. You want additional colorways\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 only comes in graphite and silver case colors. Google diversifies its case colors with five options across the board. If you opt for the 41mm smartwatch, you'll choose from a Matte Black aluminum case with an Obsidian Active Band, a Polished Silver aluminum case with a Porcelain Active Band, a Champagne Gold aluminum case with a Lemongrass Active Band, or a Polished Silver aluminum case with an Iris Active Band.\nIf you opt for the 45mm smartwatch, you'll choose from a Matte Black aluminum case with an Obsidian Active Band, a Polished Silver aluminum case with a Porcelain Active Band, and a Satin Moonstone aluminum case with a Moonstone Active Band.\nYou should buy the Galaxy Watch 8 if...\n1. You want free health features\nWhile the Pixel Watch 4 offers improved sleep staging and temperature sensing algorithms for further accuracy, most of Google's new AI-powered health coach features are hidden behind Fitbit Premium, which costs $10 a month or $80 annually.\nSamsung's health features, on the other hand, are free. Let's say you're training for your first marathon. Samsung's new Running Coach feature tests your running ability with a 12-minute test, ranks it out of 10, and provides a tailored training program based on your ability and recovery. Samsung Health also suggests bedtimes based on your sleep needs -- just like Google.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nSamsung's Galaxy Watch 8 also has a unique Antioxidant Index feature not present on the Pixel Watch 4 that measures your carotenoid levels. To activate it, just press your thumb on the BioActive sensor, and the watch lets you know if your levels are within adequate or inadequate ranges.\n2. You want a thinner watch\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 is a thinner device that's easy to wear. While I've only worn the Pixel Watch 4 for a few minutes during a device demo, I noted that it was quite a bit chunkier. Some people might appreciate this, but if you have smaller wrists, the Galaxy Watch 8 will likely be a better fit."

      "text": "Updated August 22, 2025\nYesterday, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled against Ultrahuman and RingConn for patent infringement related to the Oura Ring form factor. The ITC issued exclusion and cease-and-desist orders banning all Ultrahuman and RingConn smart rings and components from being imported into and sold in the U.S. market. This ruling establishes at the most rigorous levels of review that \u014cURA\u2019s patents are valid and enforceable, and reinforces not only the strength of \u014cURA\u2019s patents but our long-term IP strategy.\nApril 30, 2025\nWe received a favorable initial determination from the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in our ongoing case with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) against Ultrahuman and RingConn for patent infringement related to the Oura Ring form factor.\nThe full filing (published to the ITC\u2019s Electronic Document Information System) outlines a long list of infringements, noting that all of Oura\u2019s patent claims were valid, as well as a summation of dishonest tactics taken by our competitors, most notably:\n- A claim-by-claim analysis found that both Ultrahuman and RingConn\u2019s products infringe every element of every asserted claim of Oura\u2019s patent (pp. 30-68).\n- Oura was the only participant to bring forward a credible witness; Ultrahuman was specifically called out for having falsified evidence of a manufacturing facility in Texas (pp. 22-25).\n- The smart ring and wearable market in the United States is growing rapidly, with many smart rings, smartwatches, and fitness trackers available, thus dismissing the notion that Oura aims to decrease competition (p. 135). To that end, we\u2019ve been clear about our willingness to collaborate with others in the space while protecting our intellectual property.\n- Oura meets the standard for United States domestic industry. (p. 117 and p. 123)\nWe\u2019re happy with the initial determination, which validates our position and the strength of our patents in the U.S. The initial determination is subject to review by the full Commission in the coming months, and we\u2019re optimistic that the Commission will make a similar determination that Oura\u2019s inventions and patents are being infringed upon by foreign competitors.\nThe U.S. patent system is a cornerstone of American innovation, empowering creators and safeguarding the creative work of inventors and companies that spur technological breakthroughs and fuel economic growth. With the vast majority of our customers, investors, and talented team members based in the U.S., this essential system has enabled Oura to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Americans and our many members around the world.\nSince Oura\u2019s inception over a decade ago, innovation has been core to our culture and long-term strategy. Today, it may seem unsurprising that the small ring form factor can house technology that accurately tracks sleep stages, blood oxygen, menstrual cycle stages, and more. But in 2013, when Oura was founded, it wasn\u2019t. We had the vision and conviction to overcome and solve the many challenges related to achieving incredible accuracy in such a small and wearable form factor, and turn them into opportunities and differentiators. The result of those early years of R&D, coupled with our ongoing investments in accuracy testing, scientific validation, and continuous user-experience improvements, is the award-winning Oura Ring experience we know today.\nIn just the last year, we\u2019ve delivered game-changing new capabilities and experiences to our members:\n- We introduced a new in-app platform, Oura Labs, allowing our members to opt in to test experimental features, provide feedback, and contribute to discussions about Oura and the future of wearable technology.\n- We took a significant stride forward in preventive health with Symptom Radar, a feature that highlights early biometric signals that could indicate the onset of illness, allowing members to take preventive actions.\n- We opened up an entirely new category in health tracking with the introduction of our Heart Health feature set, Cardiovascular Age (CVA), and Cardio Capacity (CC). CVA, a metric unique to Oura, is based on a proprietary metric related to the concept of pulse wave velocity (PWV).\n- We launched a category-leading new generation of Oura Ring, Oura Ring 4. OR4 features a proprietary sensing platform for best-in-class accuracy and personalization, sleek design delivering improved comfort, and a reimagined app experience for all Oura Members.\n- Doubling down on our commitment to women\u2019s health, we launched Fertile Window, which gives Oura members a view of their estimated fertile days, chance of conception at that time, and detected day of ovulation, giving them more information about their chances of getting pregnant throughout their cycle.\n- We acquired Veri, a personalized metabolic health company, to accelerate our metabolic health roadmap.\n- We released our first-ever Perimenopause Report to identify the physiological changes that occur in the years before, during, and after menopause, and to destigmatize the experience that all women will go through at some point in their lives.\n- We announced a long-term partnership with Dexcom, the global leader in glucose biosensing, to introduce new metabolic capabilities to our members. Together, \u014cURA and Dexcom will help members decide what and when to eat by surfacing correlations between activities like sleep and exercise and members\u2019 glucose levels. And because we know that people are affected differently by the same foods and activities, guidance and insights will be personalized.\n- We rolled out Oura Advisor, our AI-powered health coach, globally to all Oura members, marking a meaningful step in our broader pursuit of leveraging AI to transform human care.\nWe also continued investing in research and validation with partner organizations; we announced the results of a study, conducted by researchers at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, that evaluated the accuracy of sleep-staging algorithms in three consumer wearable devices\u2014Oura Ring, Fitbit Sense, and Apple Watch\u2014against gold-standard polysomnography and found that Oura Ring was the most accurate sleep tracker in four-stage sleep classification. We also collaborated with Scripps Research Digital Trials Center on a first-of-its-kind research collaboration focused on analyzing biobehavioral changes during pregnancy.\nOura is uniquely positioned to have a meaningful impact on the lives of Americans and Oura Members around the world. The ALJ\u2019s opinion is meaningful to the scientists, developers, product teams, and all of those at \u014cURA who innovate every day to ensure that Oura Ring can continue to shape the future of holistic health innovation. Our focus has always been to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible for biometric tracking devices. We believe that Oura Ring has a role to play in the future of preventative health, and we\u2019re committed to building that future today.\nOn behalf of everyone at Oura, we\u2019re grateful for this community, and we are dedicated to continuing to innovate to ensure you have the best tools to manage your health.\nIn good health,\nOura Team"

      "text": "This is the first smartwatch with built-in blood pressure monitoring - and I hope Apple's next\nThere are several blood pressure monitors on the market, but few reliable smartwatches with that functionality. Chinese tech brand Huawei's Watch D2 could change that.\nHuawei's Watch D2 includes an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device, the first wrist-based device of its kind. The wearable is certified by China's National Medical Products Association and the EU's Medical Device Regulation. According to Huawei, the device is one-fifth the width and 1/25th the volume of a traditional electronic blood pressure monitor, designed with portability and continuity in mind. The smartwatch is not for sale in the US.\nAlso: The best blood pressure watches of 2025: Expert tested\nThe smartwatch can measure blood pressure at pre-set intervals for 24 hours to calculate averages and BP rhythms, supplemented by its TruSense System for improved speed and accuracy. This sort of blood pressure monitoring occurring over a day can help those with hypertension and cardiovascular issues get a clearer picture of their blood pressure for longer than a typical doctor's visit.\nSeveral smartwatches have blood pressure monitor capabilities but require extra equipment. For example, Samsung's Galaxy Watch 7 can track your blood pressure with the help of the Samsung Health Monitor app; however, to use the feature, you need to calibrate it with a cuff-based blood pressure monitor. Samsung's wearable also hasn't received FDA approval as a BPM, so it can't be used for diagnosis or treatment. The Apple Watch can aggregate your blood pressure data in its device but can't take measurements itself.\nThe blood pressure monitor market is expected to grow within the next few years. Fortune Business Insights estimates a 9.2% compound annual growth rate for the market size from 2025 through 2032. Cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension, among other diseases, have fueled the demand for these devices.\nAlso: Best of MWC 2025: 9 most impressive products that stole our attention\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman says that a blood pressure monitoring device could come to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 this year, though the feature was previously delayed, so who knows when it will come. If implemented in Apple's next-gen smartwatch, the feature and its widespread use could detect hypertension (high blood pressure), an often undetected condition that leads to other health complications."

      "text": "Two popular smart ring makers just got caught copying Oura - here's what happens next\nSmart ring brands Ultrahuman and RingConn have been found to infringe on Oura's patent, according to an initial determination from the US International Trade Commission's Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).\nAccording to an Oura spokesperson, both products infringe on \"every element of every asserted claim of Oura's patent. \"\nDishonest tactics\nThe ALJ found that the patent, which relates to the form factor of the smart ring, is valid as an invention that existed before the Ultrahuman and RingConn smart rings. The two competitors participated in \"dishonest tactics,\" Oura says in a blog post, to develop their own smart rings.\nAlso: Oura Ring users are customizing their wearables with this clever design hack\nIn the initial determination, Oura claims that the competitors purchased and deconstructed Oura Ring devices for their own testing and product development.\n\"We are concerned and disappointed that Oura has chosen to use its patent portfolio to stifle competition rather than foster innovation in the smart ring space. We also note that there are serious doubts regarding the validity of Oura's patents,\" a RingConn spokesperson wrote to ZDNET in an email.\nFalsified evidence\nOura meets the ALJ's standard as a domestic industry, and the ALJ also found that Ultrahuman had falsified evidence of a manufacturing facility in Texas, although Ultrahuman testified against this claim.\nAlso: Why the Oura Ring 4 is still the best smart ring on the market - and I've tested dozens of them\n\"We respectfully but firmly disagree with the recent initial determination and remain confident in our position. Our fast-scaling Texas facility is set to cover 100% of US demand within the next 2-3 months -- underscoring our commitment to domestic operations and customer-first innovation,\" an Ultrahuman spokesperson wrote in an email to ZDNET. On Thursday, May 8, Ultrahuman announced that the Texas-based factory would fulfill 100% of its US production demand for the Ring Air.\nITC will review\nAs this is an initial determination, the full US International Trade Commission (ITC) will review this determination in the next few months and make a final determination.\nIf the ITC finds that Ultrahuman and RingConn infringed on Oura's patent, it could send both companies a cease-and-desist order, effectively stopping operations and sales of their smart rings. Certain features of the competitors' smart rings may also be disabled or the brands may have to fully redesign the form factor of their rings.\nAlso: Why Oura Ring 4 is ZDNET's product of the year - besting Samsung, Apple, and others in 2024\nIn the meantime, both RingConn and Ultrahuman can contest the ruling and provide their own evidence.\n\"The ALJ's opinion is meaningful to the scientists, developers, product teams, and all of those at Oura who innovate every day to ensure that Oura Ring can continue to shape the future of holistic health innovation,\" the Oura team said.\nThe results of this patent infringement could fundamentally shake up the smart ring market, as both Ultrahuman and RingConn are the market's underdogs, delivering a smart ring with many of Oura's functionalities but without its subscription fee.\nRingConn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

I credit the Oura Ring for helping me further understand the factors that impact sleep and improve my own. Smart rings track everything a smartwatch does -- sleep, activity, and wellness -- all around your finger and without a screen. Plus, they tend to have longer battery life than smartwatches, whose battery only last a day or two at most, so you spend less time charging and more time wearing them.\nWhile Oura continues to dominate the smart ring space, brands ranging from newer startups to established companies are throwing their hat -- or rather, their ring -- in the ring. It's never been a more exciting time to put one of these new, high-tech rings on your finger. As ZDNET's smart ring and health wearable editor, I keep my eye on all the notable smart rings entering the space, like the Luna Ring I'm currently testing. These new devices could introduce innovative features and fundamentally shake up the health tech space.\nAlso: Best headphones for sleeping in 2025\nThe best smart rings, like smartwatches, house a comprehensive suite of health and sleep-tracking features. Some, like the Samsung Galaxy Ring, even connect to your phone for functions like photo capture and more.\nWhat's the best smart ring right now?\nAt ZDNET, I've gone hands-on with several top smart rings, spending weeks or months wearing them to test out how their apps, battery life, and other features perform. I also always compare them with other smart rings, wearing two rings at the same time (and even wearing a smartwatch or two on top of that). Our tested pick for the best smart ring overall is the Oura Ring 4, thanks to its impressive health suite, comprehensive health data illustrations, and innovation.\nBut if you aren't willing to spend $350 on a smart ring (and an extra $70 on a subscription), I'd recommend the budget-friendly RingConn Gen 2 Air, which is $200 without a subscription and several helpful health- and sleep-tracking features to boot. Read on to learn more about the perks of the Oura and which other top smart rings are worth considering.\nThe best smart rings of 2025\nAt this point in the smart ring race, everyone is trying to beat Oura. But the Oura Ring 4 proves that the smart ring pioneer's position isn't wavering anytime soon. While most smart rings simply provide you with collected health data, the Oura Ring 4 tells you the story and the context behind that data for greater information on your health.\nWhy we like it: What separates the Oura Ring 4 from its competition is its commitment to helpful and actionable health insights that can change or encourage healthy behaviors. As someone who has used the Oura Ring 3 and Oura Ring 4 for over a year, I can attest to the smart ring's health and sleep data illustrations and recommendations that have changed my habits for the better. It doesn't just tell me my sleep or readiness score - it tells me why I got a poor sleep score by showing a graph of when my heart rate dropped that night, and how that drop in heart rate led to a low or high score. Then, it explains how factors like alcohol, exercise, or meal timing influence sleep timing, and thus, sleep and readiness scores.\nThe Oura Ring app's data illustrations provide the right amount of information about my night's sleep, yesterday's activities, and overall stress patterns - and supplement this daily data with long-term trends that can paint a fuller picture of my overall health. Still, the data rarely feels overwhelming, and even on nights when I've gone to bed too late or on days when I'm inactive, the smart ring's nudges and summaries never skew demanding or judgmental.\nWho's it for: Unlike other smart rings that focus on day-to-day health, the Oura Ring is for people who want to assess both their short-term and long-term overall health. This could be someone managing a health condition or an aging person who wants to detect early signs of strain. For example, its daytime stress data that it collects translates into a long-term resilience status that illustrates how quickly an Oura wearer bounces back from high stress. Through its daily activity information it monitors, you can learn about your long-term cardio capacity and cardiovascular age to get a sense of general heart health.\nOura's smart ring (and subsequent monthly subscription) tends to cost more than its competitors because of the constant research and product development, as well as the features that go beyond daily monitoring. So the smart ring will also be best for people who are willing to pay that expensive starting price of $350 (plus the $72 annual subscription).\nIf I could paint the Oura Ring's ideal customer, it would be one who is willing to splurge on a sleep and health-tracking device to regularly check their health data and who is looking for data-driven suggestions and innovative features to improve their overall wellness. It's also got the smallest and largest ring sizes out of all the smart rings on this list, so if a customer hasn't found the right fit in other smart rings, they will probably find a good fit with the Oura Ring.\nWho should look elsewhere: I'd recommend the Ultrahuman Ring Air if you want similarly innovative health features without the added subscription cost. If you don't need innovative health features to understand your long-term health and just want to check your sleep and readiness score, I'd recommend the Galaxy Ring, which costs a similar price of $350, or the RingConn Gen 2 Air, which costs $200, the cheapest price on this list.\nOura Ring Gen 4 tech specs: Material: Lightweight titanium with non-allergenic, non-metallic inner molding | Battery life: Up to 8 days | Charging: Full charge in 20 to 80 minutes | Compatibility: iOS and Android | Durability: Water-resistant up to 328 feet | Sizing: 4 to 15 | FSA and HSA eligible\nThe Galaxy Ring is the first smart ring released by a leading tech brand. Samsung released the smart ring last July, and it's a wearable any Android user -- that's right, no iOS compatibility on this ring -- could get excited about.\nWhy we like it: The Galaxy Ring is a great option for Samsung or Android owners. It tracks your sleep, activity, and stress, and delivers that data in a simplistic, easy-to-use format. The Galaxy Ring works best for people already integrated within the Samsung Health ecosystem, who might own a Galaxy Watch to track their activity and want a lighter health tracker for sleep. But the Galaxy Ring isn't only for Samsung users - any Android phone owner can download the Samsung Health app and start using the smart ring. The downside, however, is iPhone owners can't use the smart ring or download the Samsung Health app.\nIt delivers sleep and readiness scores that tend to be higher than other smart ring scores I've received, so it's a great option for people who want to track their slumber or exercises but not feel too bad about the rest they get. Since it pairs with Samsung phones, you can take photos by pinching your ring-wearing finger and thumb together, which is a nice, unique touch.\nWho's it for: The Galaxy Ring is best for Android users who are already within the Samsung Health ecosystem. Maybe they own a Galaxy Watch and use it for exercise tracking during the day but don't want to wear it to bed.\nWho should look elsewhere: The Galaxy Ring mainly covers daily health insights and minimal health trends. If you want more long-term health insights, I'd suggest an Oura Ring 4 instead.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Ring\nGalaxy Ring tech specs: Material: Titanium | Battery life: Seven days | Sizing: 5 to 13 | Compatibility: Android: | Durability: 10ATM waterproof rating | Charging: Charging case | FSA and HSA eligible\nThe Ultrahuman Ring Air offers up a smart ring solution for fitness enthusiasts with features that rival Oura and no subscription.\nWhy we like it: The Ultrahuman Ring Air takes health tracking to another level - it isn't just a sleep or wellness tracker - it's a borderline bio-hacker. If you're into the science behind an optimized, healthy life the Ultrahuman Ring Air is the smart ring for you.\nFrom the moment you wake up until the minute you fall asleep, Ultrahuman offers insights into how to get the most out of your day through reminders on when to consume caffeine, expose yourself to sunlight, get up and walk, and wind down.\nThe Ultrahuman Ring Air also offers experimental and innovative features that mimic those of the Oura Ring, namely its Cardio Adaptability feature, which looks a lot like Oura's Cardio Capacity feature. The best part? It's subscription-free, unlike Oura, so you have full access to your data without any additional fee. The ring's readiness and sleep scoring mechanisms appear to be fairly similar to Oura's as well - when I wore both to bed, I constantly got scores within one or two points of each other.\nWho's it for: Ultrahuman's primary audience is more for hardcore fitness enthusiasts and biohackers looking to mine as much as they can out of their body's energy reserves. These are the types of people who want to optimize their performance in the gym and maximize recovery outside of it.\nIts secondary audience, however, is someone who is interested in the Oura Ring's innovative features but doesn't want to pay for a monthly subscription for data access. In fact, if you're tired of that Oura Ring subscription, Ultrahuman offers up a trade-in program where you can exchange your Oura Ring (or earlier generation Ultrahuman Ring) for $100 off an Ultrahuman Ring Air.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you're not a fitness junkie, some of the features - and Ultrahuman's scoring system - may prove a little too intense. For example, when I tested the Ring Air against the Oura Ring, I found that my activity scores were always lower on the Ring Air compared to the Oura. For these reasons, the Ultrahuman Ring Air is made for people who already have a semi-healthy lifestyle and are simply looking to further optimize, rather than an entry-level exerciser seeking encouragement for activity and better rest.\nThe Ultrahuman's battery capacity is one of the shortest on this list. If you want a longer battery life than six days, I'd recommend the RingConn Gen 2 Air with its ten-day battery life instead.\nReview: Ultrahuman Ring Air\nUltrahuman Ring Air specs: Sizing: 5-14 | Material: Titanium coated with Tungsten Carbide Carbon | Colors: Matte grey, Aster black, space silver, bionic gold | Water resistance: Up to 330 feet | Sensors: Infrared Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, Non-contact medical-grade skin temperature sensor, 6-axis motion sensors, Red LEDs (heart rate monitoring and oxygen saturation) Green LEDs (heart rate monitoring) Infrared LEDs (heart rate monitoring) | Connectivity: Bluetooth Low-Energy | Battery: Up to six days | FSA and HSA eligible\nThe RingConn Gen 2 Air is the top smart ring for budget and battery life.\nWhy we like it: Maybe you're just starting your fitness and health journey. Or maybe you don't know how much use you'll get out of a $400 Oura Ring, so you don't want to spend all that money to leave the ring in your jewelry box four months later. The RingConn Gen 2 Air offers a lower-stakes entry point into the world of health and sleep tracking, and the ring delivers lots of the same health metrics and recommendations that are packaged into those higher-priced smart rings.\nPlus, the smart ring's battery life is the longest on this list at up to ten days, so you won't have to charge it as frequently.\nUnlike other smart rings on this list, the RingConn Gen 2 Air does not include a readiness or recovery score. Instead, it takes your sleep score, stress/relax status, vitals score, and activity score to generate an overall Wellness Balance. It's a more holistic approach to health and sleep tracking and is best for people who are casual exercisers not looking to optimize their training load with data-driven suggestions, like a readiness or recovery score.\nWho's it for: Casual exercisers looking to stay active - but maybe not looking for complete training optimization - will reap the benefits of the RingConn Gen 2 Air. The smart ring is a great entry-level health tracker thanks to its affordable price - the cheapest on this list - and its long battery life. It's also a great ring for people who wear a smartwatch during the day and are looking for a smart ring to mainly track their sleep.\nWho should look elsewhere: The RingConn Gen 2 Air's user interface is not my favorite - it feels bare bones and underdeveloped compared to the other picks on this list. If you want a smart ring with more robust data illustrations, innovative features, and an advanced user interface, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 4 or Ultrahuman Ring Air.\nReview: RingConn Gen 2\nRingConn Gen 2 Air Smart Ring tech specs: Material: Titanium | Battery life: 10 days | Sizing: 6 to 14 | Compatibility: iOS and Android: | Durability: IP68 waterproof rating | Charging: Charging case | FSA and HSA eligible\nShould I buy a smart ring or a smartwatch?\nHere are a few things you might want to consider before buying a smart ring or smartwatch:\n- Battery life: Smart rings tend to have longer battery life than most smartwatches. The average smart ring can run for four to five days without a charge, while a smartwatch like a Pixel Watch, Apple Watch, or Galaxy Watch battery can last a day or two at most.\n- Comfort: I hate sleeping with my Apple Watch and its chunky screen. But I've never had a problem sleeping with smart rings around my finger. They're far more discreet for everyday activities and don't take up as much real estate on your hands. The only time smartwatches would be more comfortable is during weight training activities, given how the weight could pinch at your finger with a ring on it.\n- Sleep tracking: Because of its longer battery life and more comfortable build, a smart ring is an amazing sleep tracker compared to a smartwatch. I've found that the most useful sleep trackers deliver a sleep score alongside each night of sleep, to give people a visualization of the night's rest. It's worth noting that the Apple Watch, one of the most popular smartwatches on the market, doesn't provide owners with this functionality. Most notable smart rings, however, include a sleep score and comprehensive sleep data in their product.\n- Activity tracking: Smartwatches take the cake when it comes to activity tracking. Unlike a screenless smart ring, smartwatches display key activity metrics like pace, distance, heart rate, and more as someone is running, cycling, walking, and more. This at-a-glance functionality makes smartwatches the true winner for activity tracking. While you can record workouts through a smart ring app, that health data is only available on your phone and oftentimes presented in full once the workout is complete.\n- Style: Style is subjective, yes. But to me, a smart ring has far more potential to look stylish against your other jewelry or outfit than a smartwatch. You can get your smart ring in gold, silver, or black to complement the jewelry tones you tend to wear most. Smart rings dissolve into your wardrobe, while a smartwatch demands more attention and can be an eyesore on a wrist.\nAll in all, depending on what you want from a health wearable, you might choose a smart ring over a smartwatch or vice versa. It's all a matter of which suits the data you'd like to track best and your preferences for comfort, style, and battery life.\nAlso: Best Android smartwatches: Galaxy Watch Ultra to the Tag Heuer\nWhat is the best smart ring?\nI recommend the Oura Ring 4 as the best smart ring based on its extensive software and hardware capabilities. However, there are other great choices out there, too. This table compares the best smart rings based on price, battery life, and materials.\n| Smart ring | Price | Battery life | Material |\n| Oura Ring 4 | $350 | Up to eight days | Titanium with non-allergenic interior |\n| Samsung Galaxy Ring | $399 | Up to seven days | Titanium |\n| Ultrahuman Ring Air | $349 | Up to six days | Titanium |\n| RingConn Gen 2 Air | $200 | Up to 10 days | Titanium |\n*Lowest price at the time of writing. Please note that prices may vary based on retailer and available promotions, sales, or discounts.\nWhich is the right smart ring for you?\nIt depends on your needs and your budget. For example, if you want a smart ring that will help you optimize your fitness routine, the Ultrahuman Ring Air is your best bet. Or, if you want the most durable option, the titanium body of the Oura Ring 4 will keep up with your wildest adventures. Below, our table helps you determine the right ring for you based on specific uses:\n| Choose this smart ring... | If you want... |\n| Oura Ring 4 | The best smart ring overall for understanding your health. Health tracking is accurate and comprehensive without overwhelming you with data, and the company rolls out new features every month. A subscription is required. |\n| Samsung Galaxy Ring | The best smart ring for Android users with impressive AI-powered sleep algorithms, activity monitoring, and a double pinch gesture for taking photos and snoozing alarms. It's the most expensive upfront cost, but you don't have to pay for a subscription, unlike a few options on this list. |\n| Ultrahuman Ring Air | The best smart ring for fitness junkies who want to optimize every part of their day with data on activity, sleep, recovery, and more. No subscription attached. |\n| RingConn Gen 2 Air | The longest battery life on this list, at up to 10 days. It's also the most budget-friendly smart ring on this list, at $200 without a subscription. |\nFactors to consider when choosing a smart ring\nIf you're interested in purchasing a smart ring, you should consider the following factors:\n- Purpose and functionality: Traditionally, smart rings like the Oura Ring are a substitute for a smartwatch or other health-tracking device. For this list, we considered rings that monitor factors like blood oxygen testing, sleep and heart rate tracking, and activity metrics, but also considered rings with smart nuances, such as NFC readings and making contactless payments.\n- Durability: To go from jewelry accessories to smart staples, there are certain durability aspects these rings should include to maximize benefits. We considered if the rings were waterproof, water-resistant, or coated with any extra protection.\n- Device compatibility: Unlike a smartwatch, smart rings don't have an interactive display. Therefore, all the data is housed via third-party software. We made sure these choices were compatible with iOS and Android.\n- Design: One of the benefits of a smart ring is that, ideally, it's sleek, subtle, and comfortable to wear -- even as your finger may swell in the summer heat.\nHow we test smart rings\nZDNET went hands-on with every smart ring on this list. We spend a few weeks or months wearing the rings to test out how their apps, battery life, and other relevant features perform -- not just for a day or two, but over the course of many wears and through different environmental conditions. When we think a product is worth your money, we put it on this list and write up a spotlight highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for.\nAlso: How we test smart rings at ZDNET\nPlus, we are constantly scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, and following news on product rollouts and upgrades. We know buying an expensive smart ring can set you back a few hundred dollars, and that's why our advice is tailored to your needs and budget and our picks are expert-vetted.\nTo learn more about my process for testing smart rings, visit this article, which covers it in depth.\nFAQs on smart rings\nWhich is the best fitness ring?\nOther ZDNET experts also assessed the Oura Ring 4 as the best overall smart ring in the fitness wearable market, especially if your goal is to track exercise and workout recovery specifically. If you aren't interested in the monthly subscription that comes with an Oura Ring, a great alternative fitness ring is the Ultrahuman Ring Air, which, in my opinion, is a sleeper hit fitness ring for anybody who wants to track their diet, get reminders and insights to maximize their energy levels throughout the day, and follow guided workouts, all on the app. This is in tandem with the already amazing health data you get on the Ultrahuman app.\nCan the Oura Ring tell if you're sick?\nSeveral stories have circulated recently about wearables like the Oura Ring waving the red flag on a user's health. Just this week, a nurse practitioner's story went viral on TikTok after her Oura Ring notified her of data that eventually led to her receiving a lymphoma diagnosis.\nOura's Symptom Radar feature monitors your vitals (your heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature, and blood oxygen) and notifies you of when there are variations worthy of paying attention to. If it detects major signs of strain, it will encourage you to rest or take a sick day.\nWhich smart rings sync with Natural Cycles?\nThe Apple Watch and the Oura Ring are the only two wearables with full Natural Cycles compatibility. The recently released Galaxy Ring, along with the Galaxy Watches, has cycle insights powered by Natural Cycles. However, it doesn't offer the full extent of fertility tracking (or charge you $20 a month, as a Natural Cycles subscription does), meaning you probably wouldn't want to use the Galaxy Ring's cycle insights as a form of contraception.\nAre smart rings FSA or HSA eligible?\nAll the smart rings I've included above are FSA/HSA eligible, meaning you can use your FSA or HSA money to purchase one. Since they track your health and sleep -- and encourage healthy habits -- they are considered a health device.\nCan I shower or swim with my Oura Ring?\nYes, the Oura Ring is waterproof up to 100 meters, so you can wear it in the shower, at the beach, or in the training pool.\nHow much do smart rings cost?\nSmart rings vary in price, depending on their features and which finish you get your ring in. A matte black smart ring is going to cost much less than a rose gold smart ring. On average, a smart ring will cost you around $250 to $450, depending on the finish and features.\nHow long do smart rings last?\nDespite how small smart rings are, their battery life can compete with, say, smartwatches. Look for a smart ring that can last up to four to seven days while you're shopping around. If you are paying around $300 for a smart ring, it should last you at least four days, but ideally five or six. The more you have to charge this ring, the less you'll want to wear it and reap the benefits of the health data tracking suite.\nAre there alternative smart rings worth considering?\nVarious smart rings on the market didn't make the cut for my top five. I've included a few other smart rings that deserve honorable mentions:"

But logging three meals daily, assessing your caloric intake, and reflecting on how your nutrition impacts your overall health can only go so far. After all, apps such as MyFitnessPal or Lose It! aren't hooked up to your body and don't monitor the minute details of how your food impacts your energy or sleep.\nAlso: This FDA-cleared blood pressure monitor delivers medical grade results at home - how it works\nThese apps don't sense the sugar in your bloodstream and detail your blood sugar's rise and fall throughout the day. A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) does, though.\nHow CGMs work\nIt's almost silly to call a CGM a meal tracker. But at its core, that's what it does. CGMs were designed for prediabetics and diabetics to track their blood sugar levels and alert them of spikes or lows. However, the device is increasingly used by fitness and health enthusiasts to understand body chemistry and nutrition. Olympic marathoner Abdi Nageeye told Reuters he used a CGM to monitor his body's energy ahead of last summer's Paris Olympics.\nAlso: Oura Ring 3 vs Oura Ring 4: How to choose\nGlucose influences everything from your mood, weight, and sleep to energy levels and disease predisposition, and research shows a connection between low glucose levels and disease prevention. \"It is clear managing glucose levels could benefit the general population. This inspired Abbott to develop a product that would bring our glucose monitoring technology to an audience that traditional healthcare companies don't usually target -- the healthy -- to help them stay healthy,\" Pamela Nisevich Bede, global nutritionist for Abbott's Lingo business, wrote in an email to ZDNET.\nDexcom Stelo, the first over-the-counter (OTC) CGM, was approved last year, paving the way for other OTC CGMs, like the Abbott Lingo, to follow suit. As a health wearables enthusiast, all this CGM buzz from athletes and body optimizers made me curious about testing one for myself.\nSo, when Abbott sent me its Lingo, a CGM designed for people aged 18 and up without diabetes interested in tracking their blood sugar, I decided to try it out. I wore the CGM on my arm for two weeks to understand what this wearable could do for the average fitness enthusiast and whether the device could replace my smartwatch or smart ring. Keep reading to find out.\nMy experience with Lingo\nCGMs aren't like a smartwatch or smart ring that slips on and passively monitors your vitals. The CGM device inserts into the back of your arm, and a tiny needle takes your blood glucose -- it's more invasive than a typical wearable. Even so, the application process was quick, aided by ample instructions on the Lingo app, and it didn't hurt to apply or remove -- to my surprise.\nAlso: This wearable gamified my stationary bike - and it's a must for workouts now\nOnce I secured the CGM to my arm, the device took time to calibrate before beginning to monitor my blood sugar. Then, it was business as usual. I'd log my meals and see how my diet and exercise coincided with glucose rises and falls.\nEvery glucose spike added more data to my \"Lingo Count,\" Abbott's scoring system that translates your daily spikes into a number. The objective is to hit or be below that number. The fewer spikes, the better. In the first week, the app set a Lingo Count of 60 for me to aim to stay below. For the second week, it adjusted to a lower Count of 37 based on my data.\nOne day, I ate a few dates as a snack, which led to a surprising spike that added 19 points to my daily score. A heavy Valentine's Day dinner of scallops, salad, potatoes, and rice pudding boosted my score by 17 points, helping to create a total of 49 Lingo Count for that day.\nAlso: This smart ring is my new go-to sleep tracker and is not by Oura\nOne morning, a breakfast of pancakes, eggs, and bacon added 20 points to my score, while some beef stew made a smaller impression, with only 7 points later that day. Another day, I ate chicken salad for lunch and barely experienced a spike. The key, Lingo tells you in its app, is to prioritize protein and healthy fats -- choose vegetables over fruits, exercise regularly, and opt for savory foods over sweet ones to avoid spikes.\nAcross two weeks of wearing the device, I learned that most meals fell within the suggested blood sugar range of 70 to 140 mg/dL. Carb-heavy meals, like rice or pancakes, would create the most significant spike.\nThe app also connects to your Apple Watch, so every time you exercise and log it through Apple Health, the data pops up in your day's timeline and shows your glucose level's reactions. I loved this feature and the compatibility with other apps, which saved me steps in the Lingo app.\nWhat I'd like to see in the Lingo's next update\nThe app didn't have much trouble loading, but viewing historical data could easily make the app glitch and send you back to the most recent day's data, which was frustrating when trying to understand your historical spikes. I hope users get further insight into the foods they're logging in future app versions.\nAlso: 5 expert-backed tips to get better sleep - especially if you own a health-tracking wearable\nWhen I logged my rice, I didn't get any insight into the ingredient itself, or how often other users experienced spikes when logging white rice. These insights can place the context of diets into a greater perspective and teach people -- beyond a simple Lingo Count number -- what foods to avoid or consume.\nThe most helpful insights came in weekly reports that detailed my average glucose, my weekly median Lingo Count, how many days I was within the Lingo Count, when my glucose spiked the most during the day, and the meals with the highest counts. On a daily level, I didn't find the app super helpful because I was usually within the target range, but the weekly snapshots provided helpful context I could apply to next week's diet.\nI understand why Abbott created the Lingo Count for glucose spike interpretation. However, a number without any context or comparison pushes the analysis of charts and data on the user instead of on the software developers who could've created a more digestible and helpful app experience.\nFor example, more context in the app could look like a daily report that takes the food a user logged the day before, summarizes what spiked their glucose the highest, and provides recommendations in the morning on how they can pair that food intake with, say, a healthy fat, a vegetable, or more protein, to keep the spike lower.\nOne of the more challenging parts of using the Abbott Lingo was remembering to log every snack, meal, glass of wine or morning cold brew. Let's say you tracked every meal you ate for a year with the Lingo. You'd be responsible for 1,095 meal entries, not including snacks or dessert. That's tedious work.\nAlso: Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 8: Which model should you buy?\nNot that you'd use the Lingo for an entire year. Two weeks of glucose monitoring will cost you $49, four weeks is $89, and 12 weeks is $249. If you used the Lingo for a whole year, it would cost you $1,083. The Abbott Lingo is a temporary device that could provide context into your diet for a short enough time to make meaningful changes and see results, but maybe not enough to document a whole year of blood-sugar highs and lows.\nI asked Nisevich Bede if she thought CGMs like the Abbott Lingo would one day be as widespread as smartwatches or smart rings. She said that while fitness trackers provide several health metrics, they don't capture the insights that spark behavioral changes in the way a CGM can.\nAfter testing the device, I understand where she's coming from, but I disagree. The smart rings I have tested provide me with sleep and energy scores that encourage me to get better sleep and exercise more to raise my scores. I've been so obsessed with getting my Oura Ring's resilience level to exceptional or a high 90 sleep score that I've found myself leaving parties early or missing social events to get to bed on time.\nThat focus is not because I watch my sleep or heart rate graph morning, noon, and night. Oura tells me I've leveled up from a \"strong\" resilience score to an \"exceptional\" one, the highest level you can get. Numbers are great, but data-led storytelling is crucial in this era of wearable technology.\nZDNET's buying advice\nFor $49, I'd recommend the Abbott Lingo to anyone who wants to understand how diet impacts their blood sugar. Keep in mind that it is currently only available for iOS users. Maybe they want to see how their intake of sugar and carbs impacts their energy. Perhaps they want to know why they need a nap every day after lunch. A two-week CGM is affordable enough for the bio-wearable-curious.\nHowever, the device might only affirm what you already know if you're generally healthy with a good exercise regimen and eating habits.\nLooking for the next best product?
