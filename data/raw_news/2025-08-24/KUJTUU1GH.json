  "description": "Time-bending roguelike Panta Rhei is one of the more approachable entries in the popular genre.",
  "content": "This article is part of Run, Die, Repeat, Polygon's week-long series exploring roguelikes.\n\nThe flow of time lies at the heart of Panta Rhei, the debut project from Reignite Games and one of the summer\u2019s underrated indie gems. It\u2019s a roguelike that has players taking control of Phi, a young Guardian of Time, after their realm is threatened by proper noun Chaos. They wield a sword, sure, but their ability to manipulate the world around them by pausing and rewinding time is their strongest weapon.\n\nInterestingly, the levels in Panta Rhei are very static, or at least the ones I played through during my first few hours with the game. Instead of Phi\u2019s path being randomized whenever they set off on a fresh run, they tread the same levels. It\u2019s an interesting departure from most roguelikes, in which you often don\u2019t know what rooms you\u2019re about to step into, and helped me better track my progress each run. However, I could see how fighting through the same level layouts every run could get a tad dull over time, even though there are a few off-the-beaten-paths to explore.\n\nPanta Rhei\u2019s combat is so engaging, however, that the moment-to-moment gameplay never bores. Phi has light and heavy attacks, and combos that mix the two. All well and good there. What sets Panta Rhei apart is how rewinding Phi through time adds an exciting layer to combat. I really like using the whirlwind combo, which is two light attacks followed up by a heavy attack in which Phi lands multiple hits on foes. Once the animation is done, I can rewind and watch the same attacks play out in reverse for additional damage. This is also a nifty way to get out of danger, by rewinding Phi enough that they\u2019re no longer on top of any enemy.\n\nRewinding attacks isn\u2019t just a fun little trick: it\u2019s necessary to damage shielded enemies. An aqua blue barrier encases some foes, and it can only be broken by attacking them as Phi rewinds. Some of the tougher enemies will become shielded midway through encounters, ensuring Panta Rhei keeps ya on your toes.\n\nPhi also has the power to rewind and pause time around certain objects. This is necessary in some levels (like reconstructing a broken bridge), and very helpful during certain combat encounters. Traps are often the bane of my existence in roguelikes, but in Panta Rhei, they\u2019re my allies. I take so much joy in luring enemies near traps, then rewinding time and using them against unsuspecting foes.\n\nWhat I appreciate most about Panta Rhei is how approachable it is. Phi is healed after clearing an encounter, meaning managing HP isn\u2019t as stressful as in many other roguelikes. As long as I keep the damage to a minimum, Phi will often be brought back up at full health after the encounter ends. Phi can also be revived during runs by using lifetime capsules, and runs start with two available. An additional capsule can be added via investing in Phi\u2019s skill tree, meaning after just a couple hours of playtime, I\u2019m able to enjoy runs with three revives in my pocket. Saving up my coins over the course of a run can even let me replenish them, if a merchant has one in stock.\n\nPanta Rhei feels like a roguelike for people who are put off by the typical difficulty of the genre. After just a few runs, Phi feels like a nimble powerhouse \u2014 one who thankfully won\u2019t be derailed by an early or unexpected death.\n\nPanta Rhei is out now on Windows PC. The game was reviewed on PC using a prerelease download code provided by Reignite Games. Valnet Inc. has affiliate partnerships.

      "text": "For video games, the summer season kicked off with a double-header: the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, smack amid the three-day slew of game reveals that comprise Summer Game Fest (and its surrounding press conferences). But the most exciting games of the summer aren\u2019t all Switch 2 ports or massive studio tentpoles. In fact, it\u2019s the smaller games \u2014 the indies and the AA gems \u2014 that have captured most of Polygon\u2019s attention.\nFrom a management sim about temperamental clones to an open-world adventure in which you bike your way to saving the world, here are 11 under-the-radar games to watch out for this summer.\nThe Alters\nRelease date: June 13 (out now!)\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series X\nHow well do you think you would enjoy working with a few radically different versions of yourself? That\u2019s the question Jan Dolski is facing \u2014 that, and how he\u2019s going to survive imminent death on a hostile world. In The Alters, Dolski is the sole survivor of a scientific expedition in search of a new element. Through survival and base-building gameplay, he, alongside the alternate versions of himself he brings to life, has to find a solution for survival while contending with how varied his life could have turned out if different choices were made.\nBloodRush: Undying Wish\nRelease date: July 1\nWhere to play: Windows PC\nBloodRush: Undying Wish is like if Bloodborne met Crank, that offbeat 2006 Jason Statham action flick (stay with me here). It\u2019s a hack-\u2018n\u2019-slash roguelike where your character is constantly bleeding out during combat. You can increase your blood by killing enemies, so the gameplay is fast and frenetic; you\u2019re constantly dashing around the battlefield like you need adrenaline to survive. So, Crank. BloodRush is a fun time with gorgeous pixel art to boot. Check out a demo on Steam ahead of its early access launch.\nWheel World\nRelease date: July 23\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series X\nIn Wheel World, you play as a cyclist with the simplest of simple tasks: save the world. (You\u2019ve got this!) With a customizable bike, complete with a ghost head accessorizing it, you\u2019ll pedal and race around an open world as you set out to save it. Originally unveiled as Ghost Bike in 2023 with a somber narrative, Wheel World was rejiggered in fall 2024 with a new title and a lighter tone focused on \u201cthe joy and freedom of living around bikes,\u201d developer Messhof wrote in an update on Steam.\nNinja Gaiden: Ragebound\nRelease date: July 31\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X\nIt\u2019s a big year for the Ninja Gaiden franchise. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, a remaster of 2008\u2019s Ninja Gaiden 2, was surprise dropped earlier this year alongside the reveal of Ninja Gaiden 4, the first new mainline entry in over a decade. Between those releases, fans will also have the chance to play Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, a side-scrolling action-platformer. The Ninja Gaiden series started on NES, so Ragebound takes it back to its roots in a way with its pixel art aesthetic. You can play its Steam demo to get a feel for the challenge of Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, which comes from the developers behind the Blasphemous games.\nPanta Rhei\nRelease date: July 31\nWhere to play: Windows PC\nLike in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, wielding time is a core tenet of Panta Rhei, a roguelike that casts you as Phi, who must protect the flow of time. Bend time to solve environmental puzzles as well as to save your skin in combat. Panta Rhei\u2019s art style and orange and violet hues remind me of Annapurna\u2019s excellent Cocoon, so it\u2019s already starting off on the right foot. Get a taste of its roguelike combat via its demo on Steam.\nArtis Impact\nRelease date: Aug. 7\nWhere to play: Windows PC\nArtis Impact follows Arkane and her AI companion, Bot, as they venture through a futuristic world full of murderous AI \u2014 and tasty potato croquettes. Its pixel art is great, and the manga-inspired comic panels that function as cutscenes are truly killer. Gameplay will be a mix of turn-based combat and regular life activities, like cooking or earning passive income. It may be set in a post-apocalyptic world, but it\u2019s a cozy post-apocalyptic world.\nTiny Bookshop\nRelease date: Aug. 7\nWhere to play: Windows PC\nThere are two things the world can never have enough of: books and bookshops. In Tiny Bookshop, head to a small coastal town to start your own bookstore. It\u2019s a quiet and cozy game, one that\u2019s divorced from the stress of working retail IRL. Tiny Bookshop instead lets you sit back and recommend great books to customers who\u2019ll buy them up. Decorate your bookshop on wheels to your heart\u2019s content and keep your shelves stocked by purchasing used books from classified ads like it\u2019s 1998 all over again.\nSword of the Sea\nRelease date: Aug. 19\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC\nDeveloper Giant Squid is known for stylish games Abz\u00fb and The Pathless, and Sword of the Sea looks to carry that stylish torch forward. Your big, cool sword isn\u2019t needed for combat, but for traversal. Sword of the Sea\u2019s gnarly movement is based on skateboarding, snowboarding, and surfboarding, and you\u2019ll use your Hoversword to ride waves of sand. Over the course of the game, you\u2019ll work to restore an ocean, and then catch its waves. Surf\u2019s up, dude.\nThe Knightling\nRelease date: Aug. 28\nWhere to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series X\nThe Knightling ditches swords and maces for a shield as its titular hero\u2019s weapon of choice. It\u2019ll be used in combat Captain America style, of course, but also for traversing the game\u2019s open world via some very sick-looking shield surfing. The Knightling gives off the vibe of a PS2-era platformer with modern-day visuals, and I can\u2019t wait to check it out this August \u2014 good thing it\u2019s got a demo on Steam!\nHirogami\nRelease date: Sept. 3\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC\nSet in an origami world, where seemingly everything has been created via the delicate Japanese craft, Hirogami is an action-platformer. Hiro can fold himself into different transformations, like an armadillo or a frog, to traverse the fragile world and battle digital creatures who are threatening it. Play the demo on Steam to get a feel for Hiro\u2019s origami powers yourself.\nHell is Us\nRelease date: Sept. 4\nWhere to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox Series X\nHell is Us wears the aesthetics of a Soulslike without some of the genre\u2019s challenges; enemies stay dead, meaning your corpse runs won\u2019t be as tenuous, and the game places a greater emphasis on exploration than combat. You\u2019re cast as Remi as he enters and explores a war-torn country in search of his parents. Along the way, he encounters more than he bargained for in the way of some creepy enemies, and he\u2019lll wield a big glowing sword to take them down."

      "text": "This article is part of Run, Die, Repeat, Polygon's week-long series exploring roguelikes.\nAh, the roguelike. A genre named after the 1980s game Rogue and one that I\u2019ve tried time and time again to get into \u2013 so much so that I actually purchased Rogue a few weeks back to throw myself into it. I\u2019d tried 2011\u2019s The Binding of Isaac, even Slay the Spire when it first released in 2019, and now I thought I\u2019d try the game that birthed this genre. Maybe, just maybe, my mind could be changed.\nI didn\u2019t like Rogue. I tried my best to like The Binding of Isaac. And despite my numerous attempts to get into Slay the Spire and see the fun aspect of it, I left feeling like I had ultimately lost 4 to 5 hours of my life that I was never going to get back.\nSo, roguelike enjoyers, I have but one question: Who hurt you?\nFor those of you who are blissfully unaware of what a roguelike is, let me explain. While the ultimate definition varies greatly depending on who you ask, roguelikes are usually considered a subgenre of role-playing games. Players take on the role of a character and must hack and slash their way through a procedurally generated dungeon \u2013 or other such setting \u2013 while picking up upgrades for health, weapons, abilities, and so forth. However, if a player dies, they must start over from the beginning with no upgrades, no new fancy weapons and armor, just a brand-new character.\nI\u2019m a fully-grown woman who writes for a living. I\u2019ve got a niece to look after. Two very loud and obnoxious dogs who do not understand the concept of working from home and thus want me to throw ball 24/7. My neighbor does not understand what \u201ca respectable level of noise\u201d is when they blast Mitski at 10 p.m. As you can see, my periods of relaxation are very slim. So the whole concept of a subgenre that requires me to play continuously and, when I die (because I am going to die), have none of it matter makes me want to set myself on fire.\nAnd I get it. There\u2019s something magnetic about the thought of making it to the end and completing a game with an encyclopedia of knowledge sitting in your noggin, which is only possible thanks to your hard efforts and many (many\u2026many\u2026) deaths. It feels a bit like when you go to those restaurants where, if you eat a plethora of food for a challenge, you get the honor of not paying for it. Painful, but worth it. Skillful even. Maybe I would enjoy it if I simply got good. But consider: What if I don\u2019t have time to get good? My niece has managed to install several viruses on her phone, my dogs want to go out for their nightly walk, and they\u2019ve figured out how to open the bathroom door, so there goes my last hiding space for a bit of peace and quiet. I still haven\u2019t cooked dinner yet.\nBut despite my aversion to roguelikes, there is an alternative that I do love: roguelites. Games like Hades and Sword of the Necromancer incorporate roguelike elements, including random dungeons and a death mechanic that sends you back to the start of each run. But these games also allow you to keep the upgrades to your character, so that each new run doesn\u2019t feel so agonizingly pointless. For some people, the difference between the two subgenres probably feels a tad like splitting hairs: What, the only difference is player progression? And to that I\u2019d say yes, but the player progression aspect of roguelites versus roguelikes is incredibly important to me.\nFor gamers who turn their nose up at the thought of \u201cshortcuts\u201d in video games, the idea of player progression in roguelikes might seem like sacrilege. After all, roguelike players, much like soulslike players, get a (well-deserved) ego boost from these games. If you\u2019re not skilled enough to get to the end without any help, the thinking goes, are you truly a gamer? However, this completely ignores just how different each gamer is. I may not be a competitive or even skilled person in the realm of roguelike gameplay, but that doesn't mean I should forego them forever, even if I just so happen to enjoy the story and other aspects that the game has. That doesn\u2019t seem fair.\nThis is why the Hades series, in particular, is such an intriguing roguelite to me. As Zagreus or Melinoe, you fight your way through various realms of the ancient Greek afterlife, and even if you absolutely eat dirt two minutes in and are sent back to the start, the game doesn\u2019t punish you for it. Instead, it leans on its cast of characters, in addition to unlockable features like weapons, locations, and item stores, to encourage you to get back into another run. It rewards you for your efforts, in other words.\nWhile I\u2019ve felt frustrated at dying in a roguelite, in the Hades games (and other games that take on a similar framework), I\u2019ve never felt as though I was the butt of a joke. I felt more like I learned something, could come back stronger, and used the time away from the dungeon to invest in upgrades and explore the main hub area where the main character\u2019s friends, family, and love interests hang out. In my experience, true-to-form roguelikes do not have this sense of connection. Progression is rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 reflected on you in a meaningful way.\nTo be frank, the main appeal of roguelites for me is that there\u2019s a chance I actually get to the end. And I do want to progress through the game and get to the end, because to me, not completing something I\u2019ve specifically set out to complete feels like a moral failure. I know, I know, discussion material for my therapist. So, to the game developers out there who know just how vital it can be to feel that progress, I salute you.\nAnd to roguelike enthusiasts, I will never understand you, but if they bring you joy, who am I to judge?"

  "argos_summary": "Polygon\u2019s review of Panta Rhei, a roguelike from Reignite Games, showcases its time\u2011manipulation mechanics that let players pause, rewind, and re\u2011play attacks to break shields and solve puzzles. Unlike most roguelikes, the game features static level layouts, making progress easier to track while still offering engaging combat and a forgiving health system that heals between encounters and provides revives. The article also situates Panta Rhei within a broader list of underrated indie titles slated for release in summer 2024, noting its approachable difficulty and emphasis on strategic use of time. Overall, Panta Rhei offers a fresh take on the genre by blending classic roguelike progression with a unique time\u2011based toolkit.",
