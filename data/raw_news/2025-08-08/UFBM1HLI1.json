  "description": "We chugged through these electrolytes while we were were totally sober, so you don\u2019t have to worry when the Sunday Scaries hit.",
  "content": "You\u2019ve likely heard of electrolytes (you know, the essential minerals \u2014 sodium, calcium, and potassium \u2014 that are vital for the body).\n\nAfter a night of drinking or a grueling workout, your body could be running low on some of these vital nutrients. Hence, you\u2019ve probably seen electrolyte drinks and powders rise in popularity. Several brands even claim to be backed by a little nutritional science.\n\n\u201cElectrolyte drinks are a category of sports beverages designed with electrolytes in their formulas to replenish what is lost in times of need,\u201d Jeremie Walker, MD, MBA, consulting physician at Opt Health, told the New York Post. \u201cMost electrolyte drinks will have a balance of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sometimes calcium or chloride.\u201d\n\nElectrolytes aren\u2019t limited to just drinks. Powders, much like protein powders, have also seen an influx in demand, with popular brands like Liquid I.V. and LMNT offering convenient, on-the-go packets. This form is an easily absorbable medium to increase your electrolyte count and help replenish fluids that may have been lost during your sweat sessions \u2014 or after staying out too late.\n\n\u201cElectrolyte powders are concentrated forms of electrolytes and flavorings that you add to your own water or beverage of choice when needed,\u201d Walker added. \u201cJust like the ready-to-go electrolyte drinks, they often contain a balance of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and other additives.\u201d\n\nAhead, the Post Wanted Team tested the best electrolyte drinks and powders, as recommended by our team of medical experts. We dished our honest opinions on taste, texture, packaging, formulation, and more. Read on for our full review.\n\nFollowing, you\u2019ll find an in-depth FAQ section filled with essential info about electrolytes, incorporating these wellness supplements into your diet, and more.\n\nExactly what the Doctor ordered \u2014 no really, our experts have recommended this brand for good reasons. Dr. Berg\u2019s Sports Hydration Electrolytes incorporate real, high-quality ingredients like fine Pink Himalayan Sea Salt and trace minerals sweetened with stevia, rather than sugar. Many users report better hydration after supplementing with this powder, and say that it helps support energy levels, too.\n\nNew York Post Review: Dr. Berg is one of the better-for-you electrolyte supplements on the market. We probably wouldn\u2019t recommend it to individuals who are sensitive to potassium or are on any medications, but the higher-potassium count is ideal for active people and athletes (AKA this will replenish your lost water). The flavor of the Himalayan Sea Salt is preferable over other salty formulas we tried, and the stevia aftertaste wasn\u2019t overpowering. It does require a bit of mixing to create a smooth consistency.\n\nFactor\u2019s specially-formulated blend for energy and immune system support packs in a whopping 1800 mg of electrolytes with added vitamin C, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. As part of Factor Form\u2019s subscription service, it\u2019s delivered every 4 weeks, making it a convenient choice for anyone trying to meet long-term hydration goals.\n\nUse voucher code \u201cFJ-VMS-40OFF-NYPOST\u201d for 40% off orders over $65.\n\nNew York Post Review: Strong, crisp, and bursting with flavor, Factor Form\u2019s Hydration Boost is a refreshing formula that dissolves in seconds, with barely any mixing necessary. Yes, it\u2019s potent, and you can taste the sodium, but that was just more proof that it works. It has a pretty sweet profile, too, which was shocking considering there\u2019s zero added sugar. Our favorite part? The single-serve backs also make it very easy to dose out, without spilling or wasting powder. A huge win if you\u2019re in a hurry.\n\nWith over 30,000 purchases on Amazon in this month alone, Liquid I.V. Hydration Multiplier is a fan-favorite name in the electrolyte market. The formula isn\u2019t just for hydration; it also contains 100% of the daily value of four B vitamins. Reviewers are impressed with how fast they work, mentioning that they wake up less groggy, with fewer body aches, and overall have more energy with Liquid I.V. There have been some questions over advertising claims, but the customer reviews continue to lean very positive on taste and toleration \u2014 and The Post agrees.\n\nNew York Post Review: Liquid I.V. has about 10 grams of sugar in one packet. That is a bit higher than most of us would prefer, and you definitley can taste the sugar. As one Post Wanted member put it, \u2018it\u2019s almost sweeter than a Gatorade.\u2019 For kids or picky-eaters, this might be their go-to, but for those trying to avoid sugar, we\u2019d skip it. The brand does donate millions of servings of Liquid I.V. and over 1% of its revenue to impact programs, so there is a philanthropic hook there.\n\nOn-the-go hydration that comes in more flavors than we can keep track of? Yes, please. Nuun Sport Hydration is among the most popular electrolyte supplements on the internet, and comes in handy blue tubes filled with tablets that you can plop right into any liquid. They dissolve on their own, no shaking necessary. Featuring five essential electrolytes and just a single gram of sugar, they\u2019re an easy hack for staying hydrated.\n\nNew York Post Review: They\u2019re viral on social media, ridiculously easy to take, and come in fun flavors like orange, tropical, and tri-berry. Check, check, check. Unfortunately, the flavor was a bit stronger than most of us expected, and the fizziness takes some time getting used to. But if you need something simple to travel with, this tube is a great choice. It\u2019s also a bit more affordable than some other brands, with 60 servings per bundle. Keep in mind, they do have 1000mg of potassium.\n\nFormulated for serious athletes and people who sweat frequently, LMNT packs a punch with 1000mg of sodium in a single serving. It\u2019s backed by a growing body of research that suggests optimal health outcomes occur at higher-than-recommended sodium levels. That being said, it may not be the best choice for people trying to watch their sodium levels.\n\nNew York Post Review: 1000 mg is a lot of sodium, so we were not surprised that LMNT tastes pretty it\u2019s salty. Very salty, actually. One member of the Post Wanted team remarked that all he could taste was the salt \u2014 but if you\u2019re serious about replenishing lost water, LMNT may be your best bet. Some users have suggested that this formula helps alleviate muscle cramps and fatigue, making it a go-to for post-gym recovery. Diluting with some extra water could help soften the flavor.\n\nThe Liquid Death formula looks hardcore, but tastes very pretty sweet. Each powder stick has 1000mg of electrolytes and 8 essential vitamins and nutrients (including Vitamin B6, B12, and magnesium). Reviewers say these drinks are easy to mix and are loved by the entire family. The added sugar helps, but the sodium-potassium ratio is pretty tolerablele, too.\n\nNew York Post Review: If you\u2019re sensitive about how electrolytes taste, Liquid Death is for you. Our team found that the formula was very refreshing, crisp, sweet, and balanced (one person remarked it would be a great mixer for drinks). There\u2019s a wide variety of flavors, so you can switch things up. The packets are small are super portable, too. With eight essential vitamins on top of sodium and potassium, you really can\u2019t go wrong with Liquid Death. They\u2019re near the top of the editor\u2019s list.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve already heard about it. PRIME Hydration + Powder is a supplement developed by Logan Paul and KSI\u2019s brand, PRIME, and it\u2019s still blowing up on social media. Users love the thirst-quenching flavors (think Strawberry Watermelon, Ice Pop, and Blue Raspberry), and the ingredients seem to stack up, as well. Rather than relying purely on sodium and potassium, PRIME also uses naturual electrolytes from coconut water and antioxidants for a full-body energy fix.\n\nNew York Post Review: It\u2019s hard to beleive that there\u2019s no added sugar in the PRIME Hydration + Powder, because it sure is sweet. One person on our team exclaimed that it tasted like a Jolly Rancher, while others compared it to Jelly Beans. For people with a sweet tooth, it\u2019s your on-the-go hydration dessert. The incorporation of antioxidants and coconut water also makes it stand out from some competitors. If you\u2019re seeking a more well-rounded supplement to target hydration and overall health, PRIME is your powder.\n\nReady for an electrolyte supplement made with real fruit? Sport Drink uses real, toxin-free ingredients to deliver lasting energy: fruits, sugar, and clean salt. It\u2019s a simple formula, but reviewers say it\u2019s effective, with some reporting that they \u201cfeel like a new person\u201d after supplementing with Sport Drink. It\u2019s not individually packaged, so the draw is that you\u2019ll need to dose it out accordingly. The addition of magnesium can help with headaches, too \u2014 making this one of our favorite electrolytes brands for hangovers.\n\nNew York Post Review: This may not have been the most delectable electrolyte supplement we tested, but it\u2019s all natural with zero artificial colors or flavors. You can see it in the color \u2014 it\u2019s not one of those crazy artificial bright pink powders that make you feel like you\u2019ve just downed a gallon of simple syrup. The Sport Drink formula does have some sugar, and it\u2019s carbonated lightly with baking soda to delay fatigue. Some people like this fizz \u2014 others do not. When it comes down to the nitty-gritty, Sport Drink still offers a solid ratio of sodium to potassium, and a nice serving of magnesium to help with recovery.\n\nMade with 25 clean and tested ingredients, DryWater distinguishes itself from some competitors by using real fruit \u2014 including raspberry, lemon, coconut water, and banana. These ingredients provide naturual antioxidants, in addition to the 1000mg of potassium and 380mg of sodium. DryWater also employs Proprietary IsoCell technology, which claims to improve water and micronutrient absorption. Many reviewers agree that it\u2019s fast-acting, providing an immediate effect on hydration after tough workouts.\n\nNew York Post Review: It\u2019s difficult to find an electrolyte drink with real fruits and ingredients you can pronounce, so DryWater definitely gets some points in that department. The flavors are not bad, either. It\u2019s mildly sweet and just the right amount of citrus. There is a slightly dry mouth aftertaste, but it didn\u2019t bother most of our testers. Bonus: The stick packs are small, light, and easy to carry, so you can take them with you anywhere.\n\nTHORNE Daily Electrolytes are on the pricier side, but the ingredients are clean, there\u2019s no added sugar, and the packaging is very easy to read. Along with an ample dose of sodium (derived from Himalayan Pink Salt) and potassium, THORNE incorporates 40mg of magnesium, which can help with headaches. It\u2019s also NSF Certified for Sport and trusted by over 100 professional sports teams.\n\nNew York Post Review: THORNE has done a great job of masking the flavor of some of these minerals. The profile is far more muted and less salty than others we tried, which is ideal for those sensitive to strong flavors. It\u2019s also very easy to read and truly tastes clean, free of filler and junk. It\u2019s almost hard to beleive that there is sodium and potassium in there, because the flavor is so mild. It\u2019s a great electrolyte for someone who doesn\u2019t really like the taste of electrolytes.\n\nActivated charcoal is one of our in-house secret weapons for surviving hangovers. This gritty, tasteless powder binds to toxins, helping flush out your system. While good hydration and some electrolytes will certainly help, tossing a few of these capsules in your rotation might help your body bounce back faster.\n\nWith \u201cBelly Comfort\u201d in the name, you know these soothing Organic Belly Comfort Lozenges are just what you\u2019ll want to reach for when the night goes a little too long. They\u2019re packed with real ginger and lemon, which experts recommend for reducing nausea, bloating, and even headaches. Just don\u2019t skip the water. Lozenges are great, but they\u2019re not magic.\n\nAnother on-the-go hydration hero: coconut water. Aside from being delicious, coconut water is also naturally rich in electrolytes, thanks to the potassium count. Even one serving can help replenish what you lost and get you back to feeling normal. This premium version, by Once Upon a Coconut, is straight from the source, rather than concentrated \u2014 so you\u2019re getting the most nutrients out of it.\n\nWhile evaluating the best electrolyte supplements, our team consulted several health experts and tested each supplement based on four main factors: taste, texture, hydration, and packaging.\n\u2022 Taste: In order to stay consistent with your hydration goals and boost recovery, you\u2019ll want to find a flavor you can tolerate. Electrolytes have a good amount of sodium, which can create a salty profile. We looked for somewhat sweet, milder formulas that came in a range of flavors (so you can find your favorite). We considered the smell, aftertaste, artificial flavoring, and overall palatability while testing.\n\u2022 Texture: Texture is also very important, as some people can be sensitive to the grittier or clumpier formulas. While taste-testing the electrolyte supplements, are team looked for supplements that were smoother, balanced, and mixed easily. We made note of any formulas that felt dry, chalky, or if any residue was left on the bottom of the cup after drinking.\n\u2022 Hydration: While evaluating the best electrolyte supplements, we checked the daily value of several key nutrients that help replenish lost water, including sodium, potassium, and sugar. We also highlighted the inclusion of different ingredients, like B vitamins, magnesium, sea salt, and coconut water, to aid in recovery. Quality, purity, and ingredient testing were also considered.\n\u2022 Packaging: Packaging is also a key factor, as many electrolute users like to take these supplements on the go. We looked for supplements that came in small, lightweight, easy-to-open, pre-packaged packets. This helps eliminate the mess of scooping (and spilling) powders. Consideration was also given to brands using durable, eco-friendly packaging with visible labels on key ingredients.\n\nAn FAQ on Electrolyte Supplements and Hangover Cures\n\nAhead, our team of medical experts best explained what electrolytes are, their benefits, and what to know before incorporating an electrolyte drink or powder into your diet.\n\n\u201cElectrolytes are essential minerals, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, that have an electric charge and are vital for basic body functions like fluid balance, chemical reactions, and muscle contractions,\u201d Kara Lydon, RD, registered dietitian, certified intuitive eating counselor, and owner of Kara Lydon Nutrition, told The Post.\n\nElectrolytes are found in the blood, urine, cells, tissues, and other body fluids.\n\nWhat are the benefits of electrolytes?\n\nThe benefits of adequate mineral intake go way beyond maintaining hydration status.\n\n\u201cWithout proper cellular hydration and function, we easily get fatigued, weak, and can even have convulsions,\u201d Walker said. \u201cSo, there are many reasons one could be underserved in electrolytes, including poor nutritional intake, medicines, hormonal challenges, or excessive training.\u201d\n\nThat said, maintaining optimal mineral intake based on your level of activity or other competing factors will support a healthy hydration status, which in turn powers all other operating systems.\n\nWhat are the benefits of consuming electrolyte drinks?\n\n\u201cReplacing electrolytes during times of acute water and mineral depletion like excessive sweating from training, diarrhea, vomiting, or large burn injuries can be very beneficial to restoring a healthy water balance and cellular function,\u201d Walker explained.\n\n\u201cDrinking too much naked water (without electrolytes) in one sitting after any of the above conditions could cause hyponatremia, which could be fatal,\u201d he warned.\n\nAnd of course, the perceived enhanced performance and recovery that can be gained from these drinks is alluring to most.\n\nWhat ingredients to look for in an electrolyte drink, according to experts\n\n\u201cWhen shopping for all these products to find the best fit for you and your needs, just like other manufactured industrial food products, it behooves you to always read the ingredient labels,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe fewer the ingredients, the better.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re engaged in long-distance runs for hours, you might need one with more sugar content than the person who just did a 30-minute HIIT workout. According to Walker, you don\u2019t need sugar for the standard one-to-two-hour training sessions. In turn, lower time-framed workouts should be supplemented with low-to-no-sugar electrolyte replacements.\n\n\u201cYou also want to avoid the artificial colorings like Red #40 and Yellow #5,\u201d he added. \u201cMost will have a respectable balance of the essential electrolytes that can enhance replenishment.\u201d\n\nHow much sodim should be in an electrolyte?\n\nLydon recommended taking a look at the amount of sodium listed in an electrolyte drink and aiming for around 100 to 250 mg of sodium (unless you\u2019re an elite athlete; you may need more).\n\n\u201cMany electrolyte drinks and powders contain very high amounts of sodium when the average person easily meets and even exceeds the daily amount of sodium recommended,\u201d she noted.\n\nHowever, electrolyte needs are highly individualized based on how intense your exercise is, how long you\u2019re exercising for, and how you sweat (salty sweaters need more sodium), so she recommends consulting with your own individual sports dietitian to assess.\n\nHow often should one consume an electrolyte drink or powder?\n\nThere is certainly some uncertainty when it comes to how many electrolyte replacements a person needs throughout the day or week. For the everyday person or athlete who might run into the above problems, causing electrolyte/hydration imbalances, having two to three electrolyte drinks a week would be acceptable, according to Walker.\n\n\u201cYou could get by with one a day, and there is no long-term data substantiating any harm, but we have to be aware of the tradeoffs \u2014 like extra sugar or artificial sweetener exposure and water quality of the product.\u201d\n\nWhen, exactly, should electrolyte drinks and powders be consumed?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best to consume electrolyte drinks during or right after exercise that lasts 60 or more minutes,\u201d Lydon advised. \u201cThis is especially true on hot days or after intense workouts.\u201d\n\nElectrolyte drinks are also helpful to consume when you\u2019re working out more than once a day.\n\nWho should avoid consumption of an electrolyte drink or powder?\n\nYou should always consult your doctor before consuming a sports-enhancing product like electrolyte drinks in any significant quantity, or \u201cif you have concerning medical conditions that could be exacerbated by too much water and mineral replacement, like heart or kidney failure, to mention a few,\u201d Walker noted.\n\nThere are multiple reasons a hangover happens, according to Amy Goldsmith, a registered dietitian nutritionist and the founder of Kindred Nutrition & Kinetics.\n\n\u201cFirst, alcohol can make people urinate more. If they aren\u2019t focusing on balancing hydration, they become dehydrated, which causes symptoms of dry mouth, dizziness, and headaches,\u201d she explained. \u201cSecond, the body breaks alcohol down to acetaldehyde, which is a toxic substance. Although it is in the body temporarily, it can cause nausea, vomiting, and sweating.\u201d\n\nGoldsmith added that alcohol can also interfere with glucose production in the liver, which can lead to lower blood sugar levels. Alcohol can also impact sleep by decreasing REM cycles and the natural circadian rhythm.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s important to ensure you are appropriately hydrated prior to drinking alcohol.\n\nCan electrolytes help you recover from a hangover?\n\nGoldsmith explained that electrolytes can prevent or speed up recovery from a hangover.\n\n\u201cThe electrolytes assist with absorbing water and balancing electrolytes to help with hangover symptoms like muscle cramps, fatigue, dizziness, or headaches,\u201d she noted. \u201cResearch suggests a vitamin B complex that includes B1, B6, B12, and folic acid can assist with hangover symptoms.\n\nShe suggested looking for electrolytes that are NSF certified.\n\nWhat are some other hangover cures?\n\n\u201cSince coconut water and regular water have a hydrating effect, they can help balance hydration, which in turn will decrease hangover symptoms of fatigue and headaches,\u201d Goldsmith shared.\n\nGoldsmith added that ginger can help with nausea. But, for people looking to prevent a hangover altogether, there are also a range of non-alcoholic drinks like kombucha that provide carbonation and support the gut.\n\n\u201cKombucha will hydrate and has probiotics, which aid gut health and can combat stomach pains one may get from the inflammation of the GI lining,\u201d she explained.\n\nCheck out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.",

  "summary": "The New York Post has tested the best electrolyte supplements for hangovers and recovery. These products contain essential minerals such as sodium, calcium, and potassium, which are vital for the body after a night of drinking or a grueling workout. Electrolyte drinks are often designed to replenish lost fluids during these times of need. Powders, like protein powders, have also seen an increase in demand. The Post Wanted Team reviews Dr. Berg\u2019s Sports Hydration Electrolytes for their high-quality ingredients and claims it provides better hydration and support for active people and athletes. Factor Form's Hydration Boost for energy and immune system support packs 1800 mg of electrolytes with added vitamin C, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. Liquid I.V. Hydration Hydration is a popular name in the electrolyte market for hydration; it also contains 100% of the daily value of four vitamins.",

Our athletic electrolyte drink powder is handmade in the United States. We use real sugar, real fruit, clean salt and toxin-free ingredients. It provides the exact ratio needed to prepare and refuel the body. Try it and observe the power of SPORT DRINK.\nAdd 1Tbsp to 10-12oz of filtered, un-fluoridated water and enjoy.\nProudly Made in the USA\nSPORT DREAM\n- NO MELATONIN\n- NO ASHWAGANDHA\n- NO VALERIAN ROOT\n- NO STEVIA OR MONK FRUIT\n- NO SUGAR ALCOHOLS\n- NO CHEMICAL FILLERS\nDO STRAWBERRIES DREAM OF ELECTRIC CREAM? is our first-ever sleep formula\u2014and the world\u2019s first sleep formula that utilizes a trio of unconventional ingredients that, once you try them, make perfect sense. Designed to replicate the way you feel after eating high-quality ice cream before bed, it\u2019s built on the holy trinity of Sugar, Fat, and Salt.\nOUR INGREDIENTS\nBAJA GOLD\u2122 MINERAL SEA SALT\nBaja Gold is an unrefined mineral sea salt harvested from the Sea of Cortez, packed with trace minerals and essential nutrients your body depends on to power muscle contractions, regulate blood pressure, support nerve function, and produce cellular energy.Unlike regular salt or other refined varieties, it retains its macro minerals and trace elements in their natural form, supporting hydration, energy, and whole-body wellness. Baja Gold's salt is free from synthetic additives, chemical processing, and anti-caking agents, so you get real salt with real benefits.\nMAGNESIUM GLYCINATE\nYou need magnesium for nearly every function in your body. Because of the low quality of soil our food is grown in, many of us are deficient in this mineral.\nMagnesium Glycinate is a highly bioavailable form of magnesium, known for its effective absorption and gentle impact on the digestive system.\nImproved muscle and sleep recovery as well as bone health, heart health and blood sugar regulation are some of its most notable benefits.\nLEMON & LIME POWDER\nOur proprietary method of drying Organic Lemon & Lime Juice is superior to both spray drying and freeze drying because it does not use synthetic fillers. Our drying process retains substantially more of the flavor, and nutrients of the fruit. We don't believe in hiding behind the \"natural flavors\" liability shield. The flavor in SPORT DRINK comes from real fruit. The added benefit of this is both of these fruits provide essential minerals and nutrients that your body needs to rehydrate and replenish itself after strenuous physical activity. You're welcome.\nDue to the chemical makeup of the sodium bicarbonate reacting with the citric acid in the lemon and lime, you will experience a pleasant fizzy effect.\nPURE CANE SUGAR\nStop drinking Stevia! Did you know that stevia was originally used by native peoples as a contraceptive? Yeah, didn't think so... Anyway, look, your body needs carbohydrates in order to recover and perform at peak levels. The best tasting way (in our opinion) to recover these lost carbs is by drinking sugar in its purest unadulterated form. Organic cane sugar is good for you (read our manifesto).\nSODIUM BICARBONATE\nAlso known as Baking Soda, Sodium Bicarbonate is a popular supplement amongst athletes that allows you to perform longer at your peak, especially during anaerobic exercises or high intensity training and sprinting.\nDue to its high pH, Sodium Bicarbonate helps to delay fatigue, letting you perform at max intensity for longer.\nPOTASSIUM CHLORIDE\nPotassium chloride is a salt-like compound that contains potassium and chloride. It comes in the form of white, colorless crystals and has a strong, salty taste. Potassium is necessary for proper hydration and function of the body and enhances muscle construction, nerve function, and heartbeat regulation. It also helps all your little cells function at optimal levels.\nWant to read more about our thoughts on sugar and why we believe it's good? Check out our in-depth sugar manifesto:\nIn the past few decades, the establishment and its foot soldiers have waged war on sugar. It has been demonized beyond imagination. As a result, many of the drinks in stores nowadays are sugar-free. Sugar substitutes like stevia, Sucralose, aspartame, and many more have taken the packaged food and drink world by storm. And nothing of value was gained..."

      "text": "If you\u2019re exploring the protein powder aisle for the first time \u2014 especially to hit those health and fitness goals \u2014 the hundreds of tubs and formulas lining grocery shelves can definitely be overwhelming.\nAside from being a quick and easy way to up your protein intake, some of the best protein powders can make a world of difference to your health.\n\u201cWe all need to consume adequate protein,\u201d Julie Garden-Robinson, PhD, RD, LRD, professor and food and nutrition specialist at North Dakota State University, told the New York Post. \u201cAdequate protein helps us fight infection, provides energy, helps wounds heal and helps maintain or build our muscle mass.\u201d\nTB12 Plant-Based Protein Powder\nFuel your body with clean, effective nutrition using TB12 Plant-Based Protein Powder, developed with the performance-driven lifestyle in mind. Each serving delivers 24 grams of high-quality pea protein, offering a complete amino acid profile to support muscle growth and recovery. With only 1 gram of net carbs and zero sugar, it\u2019s an ideal choice for those following low-carb, keto, or plant-based diets. Free from dairy, gluten, soy, GMOs, and preservatives, this protein powder ensures you get the nutrients you need without any unnecessary additives.\nAvailable in flavors like Chocolate, Vanilla, and Cookies & Cream, TB12 Plant-Based Protein Powder mixes smoothly for a satisfying shake every time. Whether you\u2019re blending it into your morning smoothie, using it as a post-workout recovery drink, or incorporating it into your favorite recipes, this versatile protein powder fits seamlessly into your daily routine. Trusted by real athletes and formulated to support your health goals, TB12 Plant-Based Protein Powder is your go-to source for clean, plant-based nutrition.\nThat said, it\u2019s important to talk to your doctor to discuss protein powder options as well \u2014 aside from reading our expert-explained tips and suggestions.\n- Brand Spotlight: TB12 Plant-Based Protein Powder\n- Best Protein Powder Overall: Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Casein Protein Powder\n- Best Protein Powder for Muscle Recovery: Factor Form Whey Protein\n- Best Protein Powder for Weight Gain: Muscle Milk Gainer Protein Powder\n- Best Customizable Protein Powder: Gainful Custom Protein Powder\n- Best Protein Powder for Weight Loss: MuscleTech Protein Powder for Weight Loss\n- Best Vegan Protein Powder: Ka\u2019Chava Superfood\n\u201cIf you are already consuming enough dietary protein, supplementing with additional protein powder is likely frivolous,\u201d Sidney Abou Sawan, PhD, MSc, CSCS, a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University investigating muscle protein synthesis in response to plant-based protein blends, told The Post. \u201cThe amount of protein suggested to maximize muscle growth when lifting weights is about 1.6 g/kg/d.\u201d\nTo kickstart your goals on a healthful high, we researched, fact-checked labels and asked experts to explain everything worth knowing about protein powders. Whether you want to build some muscle mass or counteract a nutrient deficiency, we pulled the best, lab-approved and highly-rated picks to choose from.\nAhead, find the scoop \u2014 pun totally intended \u2014 to all your burning questions about protein powders, as answered by a team of experts.\nWhat are the benefits of taking protein powder?\n\u201cDietary protein is made up of amino acids which are \u2018building blocks\u2019 that are needed to support the maintenance of body proteins,\u201d Dr. Abou Sawan said. \u201cProtein powder is an easy way to consume protein \u2014 put a scoop in a shaker cup, add your choice of dilutant, shake and consume. However, not all dietary protein is made \u2018equal.'\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, certain demographics may require additional protein. When talking with Dr. Garden-Robinson, she explained \u201csome people need more protein, including those who may be recovering from surgery, illness, have serious burns or those who are not able to meet their needs due to loss of appetite.\u201d\nOften, older adults do not consume enough protein, she explained, and they could face loss of muscle mass as a result. So, in these cases, \u201csupplemental protein as food or protein added to foods could be valuable.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the best protein powder to build muscle?\n\u201cThe leucine content of protein is something to consider,\u201d Dr. Abou Sawan said. \u201cYou can do this by seeing if the amino acid composition of your protein of interest is available.\u201d\nHe notes around 2 grams of leucine per serving is thought to be sufficient to activate muscle protein synthesis. \u201cAlternatively, consuming a protein blend (i.e. whey, casein, soy) has been shown to be as effective as consuming whey alone on stimulating muscle protein synthesis provided the leucine content is equivalent (i.e. about 15% greater consumption of the protein blend),\u201d Dr. Abou Sawan said.\nBest Protein Powder Overall: Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Casein Protein Powder\nPros:\n- High protein count\n- A good alternative to whey\n- Easy on the stomach, per reviews\nCons:\n- Pricey\nWith a Grade A ranking on Labdoor, Optimum Nutrition\u2019s Casein Protein Powder is, as Dr. Abou Sawan notes, \u201cjust as effective\u201d as consuming whey protein. Plus, it contains 24 grams of protein and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), which may contain leucine. Some reviewers have shared that the Casein works wonders on their digestive system.\n\u201cI wanted the Casein because I mostly take it at night before bed. This stuff tastes fine, and gets the job done like regular protein powder. In the past an unfortunate side effect of protein powders is that, they usually leave me gasy/bloated. I\u2019ve heard if protein powder affects your bowels it\u2019s because the protein isn\u2019t absorbing properly. With this Casein powder, I don\u2019t notice any of the bowel side effects,\u201d one person shared.\nBe sure to check with a professional if this supplement is right for you.\nProtein Serving: 24 grams | Calories: 120 | Flavors: Chocolate Supreme, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Creamy Vanilla, Cookies and Cream\nBest Protein Powder for Weight Gain: Muscle Milk Gainer Protein Powder\nPros:\n- Very high protein count\n- Good for weight gain\n- Customers generally like the taste\nCons:\n- Very high calorie (preference)\n- Limited flavors\nThough not yet lab-tested, Muscle Milk is one of the best protein powders for building muscle, per our experts. It contains all nine amino acids, including leucine, so you\u2019re sure to attain the recommended intake of 2 grams per serving. Plus, it\u2019s also available in a chocolate flavor.\nReviewers have pointed out that you\u2019ll need four scoops to get just 32 grams of protein, and that comes with over 160 grams of carbs. While this is a good choice for those looking to bulk up, there may be better options for others trying to slim down.\nProtein Serving: 32 grams | Calories: 650 | Flavors: Vanilla, Chocolate\nBest Protein Powder for Muscle Recovery: Factor Form Whey Protein\nPros:\n- High protein count per serving\n- Delicious taste\n- 100 milligrams of potassium\n- No artificial sweeteners\n- On-the-go packs are convenient, especially for busy folks or people who travel\nCons:\n- No fiber\nProtein is crucial for muscle growth and recovery, making it important to refuel with the right protein powder after a workout session. Our team tested Factor\u2019s Whey Protein and wasn\u2019t disappointed by its taste or nutrition facts. The powder has 25 grams of protein per serving, while only having 120 calories. It also has nine essential amino acids for muscle recovery and gains.\n\u201cI was actually impressed when I read the nutrition details on this protein powder,\u201d shared our Commerce Deputy Editor, Holly J Coley. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to find a protein powder with this much protein. I typically avoid whey because it doesn\u2019t agree with my stomach, but Factor\u2019s protein has been designed for improved digestion, and I was able to enjoy pack after pack without issue. It blends well and doesn\u2019t have a weird \u2018protein powder\u2019 taste. The vanilla flavor has been my favorite, but the chocolate is tasty too. On days that I\u2019ve been super busy, I\u2019ve used two packs in a single shake, and it\u2019s really kept me going. In terms of recovery, I\u2019ve noticed some improvement in my body composition, so I\u2019d recommend it to anyone serious about fueling properly after a workout. I absolutely love the travel-style packets. They make it easy to get my protein in when I\u2019m in a rush, which is more often than I care to admit.\u201d\nProtein Serving: 25 grams | Calories: 120 | Flavors: Vanilla, Chocolate\nBest Customizable Protein Powder: Gainful Custom Protein Powder\nPros:\n- Option to customize based on needs and preferences\n- Many flavor options\n- Reviewers say it is smooth, not chalky\nCons:\n- Mixed options on the flavors\nMix, match, and modify. Everyone\u2019s nutritional needs are different, so why not create a customized protein powder. Simply answer a few questions and you\u2019ll have a unique recipe tailored to your workout regimen, goals, dietary needs, and taste preferences. Choose from eight delicious flavor boosts \u2014 like strawberries and cream, cinnamon toast, and sea salt caramel.\n\u201cMy package came and it was so easy to navigate. Made just for me and my special nutritional needs. The powder formula mixes so well! There is no chalky taste and I love that I can mix up the flavors,\u201d one happy reviewer shared.\nProtein Serving: Up to 26 grams | Calories: Depends on mix | Flavors: Madagascar Vanilla, Rich Chocolate, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Cinnamon Toast, Sea Salt Caramel, more\nIs whey protein powder \u201cbetter\u201d for you?\n\u201cWhey protein is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 to maintain body proteins (muscle, skin,\nbone),\u201d Dr. Abou Sawan said. \u201cWhen isolated from milk, whey protein contains all nine essential amino acids (which, as mentioned, are the \u2018building blocks\u2019 that are needed to support the maintenance of body proteins).\u201d\nWhey protein is also rapidly digested and absorbed allowing more amino acid \u2018building blocks\u2019 to be incorporated and synthesized into new muscle, she adds.\nFor all things whey protein-related, Dr. Abou Sawan has critical expertise on the subject, especially after publishing his 2017 double-blind crossover study on how whey protein supplementation enhances whole-body protein metabolism and performance recovery after resistance exercise.\nBest Whey Protein Powder: BioTRUST Grass-fed Whey Protein Powder\nPros:\n- Grassfed formula\n- Zero sugar\n- Mixes well, per reviews\nCons:\n- Lower protein than some other brands\nAs far as whey protein powders, BioTrust\u2019s Grass-fed formula is hard to beat. Each serving is only 100 calories and still provides 20 grams of protein \u2014 plus zero grams of sugar. This is a great equation for kickstarting your metabolism and building muscle while managing weight. It\u2019s also completely junk-free, meaning there\u2019s no soy, hormones, or antibiotics involved. For someone looking for a pure recipe that packs in the protein, we suggest you try BioTrust.\nReviewers agree this powder mixes well and is easier on the stomach than many other whey varieties. \u201cBest Protein powder I have tried,\u201d one customer exclaimed. \u201cThis is the only Protein powder I use now. It has excellent flavor, can\u2019t even taste that it is low carb, keeps me feeling satisfied, and mixes perfect. Highly recommend!\u201d\nProtein Serving: 20 grams | Calories: 100 | Flavors: Chocolate, Vanilla, Salted Carmel, Strawberry Bannan, Cafe Mocha, more\nBest Mild Protein Powder: Myprotein Impact Whey Protein Blend (Vanilla)\nPros:\n- Not overly sweet, per reviews\n- Blends well into smoothies\nCons:\n- Some reviewers did not like the packaging\nThis whey protein powder received an \u201cA\u201d score on Labdoor, meaning the contents found within its nutrition label are ranked exceedingly accurately. It\u2019s also gluten-free and vegetarian. Reviewers recommend trying the unflavored option for those who aren\u2019t a fan of overly-sweet powders.\n\u201cI was tired of the too-sweet protein powders so this unflavoured one is a blessing. It can be mixed with anything, even coffee since is unflavoured. Great way to get that protein intake!\u201d one satisfied customer exclaimed.\nProtein Serving: 22 grams | Calories: 130 | Flavors: Vanilla, Salted Carmel, Cookies and Cream, Chocolate, Cinnamon Cereal, more\nBest Protein Powder for Men: Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder\nPros:\n- Customers generally like the taste\n- Mixes well into liquids\nCons:\n- Fewer flavors than some brands\nThough this specific formulation hasn\u2019t been tested by Labdoor quite yet, the brand holds an \u201cA\u201d rank and is a No. 1 bestseller on Amazon. Plus, it does the job of upping your intake. For those looking for a high-rated blend, consider Optimum.\n\u201cOptimum Nutrition is a brand I trust, and knowing that I\u2019m getting a blend of whey protein isolates, concentrates, and peptides adds to the confidence in my choice,\u201d one shopper wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient to store and fits well into my daily routine. Plus, the packaging is sturdy and resealable, keeping the powder fresh and free from clumps. While it might be a bit pricier than some other options, the taste and quality are worth the investment.\u201d\nProtein Serving: 24 grams | Calories: 120 | Flavors: Double Rich Chocolate, Vanilla Ice Cream\nBest Tasting Protein Powder: Muscle Feast Hormone-Free Grass Fed Whey Isolate\nPros:\n- Subtle taste, per reviews\n- Hormone-free whey\n- Good smell\nCons:\n- It can be a bit difficult to dissolve into liquid, per reviews\nThis whey protein powder also received an \u201cA\u201d score on Labdoor, it\u2019s keto-friendly, low-carb, and low-calorie, which is especially fitting for those who are watching their macros. Reviewers say this protein powder doesn\u2019t just taste good but smells good too.\n\u201cI\u2019m totally hooked. It\u2019s amazing!\u201d one shopper shared. \u201cAnd free of hormones and from grass-fed cows. Clean ingredients. No dangerous Sucralose! They found a loyal customer for life. As soon as you open it, you get a whiff of deliciousness. Smells and tastes like a treat. I can\u2019t say enough about this protein!!\u201d\nProtein Serving: 21.5 grams | Calories: 89 | Flavors: Vanilla, Cappucino, Mocha, Pumpkin Spice, Strawberry Cheesecake\nWhat\u2019s the best protein powder to lose weight?\n\u201cLook for the amount of protein in the portion (or scoop) described on the nutrition facts label,\u201d Dr. Garden-Robinson recommends. \u201cEating protein, in general, can help you feel full.\u201d Be sure the product has no or low added sugar, too, she adds.\nRemember that protein has calories and when consumed in excess of your needs, you could actually gain weight, per Dr. Garden-Robinson.\n\u201cIntuitively, if you are consuming a high-protein diet, you will be consuming\nmore leucine, all of which will provide ample amounts of essential amino acids to retain lean body mass,\u201d Dr. Abou Sawan adds.\nBest Protein Powder for Weight Loss: MuscleTech Protein Powder for Weight Loss\nPros:\n- Very high protein\n- Desirable protein-to-calorie ratio\n- Pleasant smell\nCons:\n- Reviewers mention it\u2019s on the pricey side\nAs a great lean protein, MuscleTech\u2019s powder only contains 2 grams of sugar, which is ideal for losing weight, per our experts. And, it\u2019s available in chocolate fudge brownie and French vanilla swirl flavors.\nReviewers note that this powder may be priced a bit higher than others, but at just one scoop per serving, it should last for a longer time. Many shared that they lost weight and grew muscle tone quite rapidly, and a little goes a long way.\nProtein Serving: 30 grams | Calories: 120 | Flavors: Chocolate Fudge Brownie, French Vanilla Swirl\nWhat should I look for in a protein powder if I\u2019m diabetic?\n\u201cWith a medical condition such as diabetes, consult with your healthcare provider before\nchanging your diet,\u201d Dr. Garden-Robinson said. \u201cRemember that some protein powders are sweetened, so the sugar or other sweetener could raise your blood sugar. Others are high in fats that are not heart-healthy.\u201d\nDr. Abou Sawan assures that protein powders \u201care generally very low in carbohydrates and would minimize rises in blood glucose.\u201d Though, be sure to speak with your doctor before protein supplementation if you\u2019re diabetic.\nBest Organic Protein Powder: Garden of Life Raw Organic Unflavored Protein Powder\nPros:\n- Zero sugar\n- Not overly sweet\n- Easy to digest\nCons:\n- Some reviewers say it is a bit grainy\nWhat\u2019s great about Garden of Life\u2019s protein powder is that it contains no sugar and no stevia \u2014 a solid option for diabetics while still containing 22 grams of protein.\nEditor\u2019s Note: Another great stevia-free option, this raw plant formula veers on the earthier side on the taste scale. If you like your smoothies and shakes less sweet and more neutral, try Garden of Life. My favorite part of their recipe; it\u2019s packed with probiotics \u2014 very helpful for digestion.\nProtein Serving: 22 grams | Calories: 120 | Flavors: Unflavored, Vanilla Chai\nWhat are the best protein powder ingredients to look for on a label?\nDr. Garden-Robinson outlines a cheat sheet of what to look for on a protein powder nutrition label:\n- An ingredient statement that is simple (or \u201cclean\u201d as some say): This means the label doesn\u2019t include a lot of artificial colors, flavors or added sweeteners. Even natural sugars such as honey count as \u201csugars\u201d on the nutrition label, although honey has some trace minerals.\n- Calories per serving (or scoop): Check out whether the product has saturated fat or trans fat, which you want to limit or minimize in your diet. Remember that adding extra calories to your diet from any source could promote weight gain. Many protein powders have up to 25 grams of protein per serving, which is about 100 calories. An extra 100 calories per day could result in a 10-pound weight gain in a year.\n- Allergies or intolerances you have to particular foods: People with wheat allergies, for example, should avoid wheat-based ingredients, while those with dairy allergies or intolerances should avoid milk-based protein products (casein or whey).\nWhat ingredients should I look for in a vegan protein powder?\nFrom wheat to rice to pea to pumpkin protein, many plant-based protein powders are available.\nInterestingly, Dr. Garden-Robinson recommends reading the nutrition label and the ingredient statement. \u201cRemember that vegetable-based protein powders may not provide the full complement of essential amino acids unless they are blends of complementary proteins,\u201d she adds.\nAccording to Dr. Garden-Robinson, look for a blend of plant-based ingredients listed on the label. Some plant protein sources are naturally higher in micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals.\nBest Vegan Protein Powder: Ka\u2019Chava Superfood\nPros:\n- Vegan-friendly\n- Generally positive reviews on the flavor\n- Added adaptogens including maca root and mushrooms, plus probiotics\nCons:\n- Higher calories per serving (preference)\nSome may think that it\u2019s difficult to support muscle growth on a plant-based diet. However, as Dr. Abou Sawan shared, it\u2019s more about getting the nine essential amino acids which are the building blocks to muscle growth.\nKa\u2019Chava has 25 grams \u2014 yes, 25 grams! \u2014 of protein per two-scoop serving, all coming from a blend of pea protein, brown rice, sacha inchi, quinoa, and amaranth. This plant-based protein combination not only gives the necessary amino acids for muscle gains but also provides lots of nutrition! The vegan-friendly protein powder has filling fiber, a host of B vitamins, veggies, and adaptogens like organic maca root and cordyceps mushroom mycelia. If that wasn\u2019t enough, it also has pre and probiotics to aid gut health. Best of all, it\u2019s delicious and has more than 67,000 reviews! Try in the flavors vanilla, chocolate, coconut acai, matcha, or chai.\nEditor\u2019s Note: I\u2019ve tried a lot of protein shakes in my life \u2014 many with that seriously unpleasant artificial aftertaste. Ka\u2019Chava is something else. These nutritional shakes have the consistency and flavor of a super-rich milkshake, and the variety of flavors from chocolate to chai and matcha ensures you never get bored. While it\u2019s an expensive shake, this drink has such a wide range of functional superfoods that it makes up for it in my book.\u201d\nProtein Serving: 25 grams | Calories: 240 | Flavors: Chocolate, Vanilla, Matcha, Chai, more\nBest Stevia-free Protein Powder: Aloha Plant-Based Protein Powder\nPros:\n- Recyclable packaging\n- No stevia\n- Incorporates natural ingredients and superfoods\n- Flavor is not overpowering\nCons:\n- Less protein than some other brands\nAs a plant-based protein free of dairy, soy, and stevia, this chocolate-flavored protein contains all essential amino acids, too, so you can restore your muscles post-workout. Not to mention, this brand boasts a clean ingredient profile while being an impressive source of iron.\nEditor\u2019s Note: One of my all-time favorite protein powders, Aloha is truly as tasty as they come. I try to avoid artificial sweeteners, and since this one is stevia-free I gave it a shot. The coconut sugar makes a huge difference. It\u2019s sweet, without being overpowering and also happens to be stocked with the ingredients that I was looking for (like pumpkin seed protein, hemp seed protein, and MCT oil from coconut). I don\u2019t have any complaints about this powder, except that I can never seem to stock up on enough of it.\nProtein Serving: 18 grams | Calories: 130 | Flavors: Chocolate, Vanilla\nBest Protein Powder for Women: Orgain Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder\nPros:\n- Best-seller on Amazon\n- Good for weight loss\n- Zero sugar\n- Unique flavors\nCons:\n- Mixed reviews on flavor\nOrgain\u2019s Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder is a No. 1 bestseller on Amazon and, since it contains no sugar, it\u2019s also a great option for diabetics and those looking to lose weight.\nEditor\u2019s Note: \u201cFor someone such as myself who isn\u2019t a huge fan of whey protein powders, this plant-based line is truly heaven-sent. It may not the best chocolate milkshake you\u2019ve had in your life, but it\u2019s mildly sweet, there\u2019s a pleasant aftertaste, and it works well to mask stronger tastes in smoothies with fruits and veggies. I\u2019ve also found Orgain to be much easier on my stomach than some other brands. I never feel overly full or heavy. As some people in the reviews section have pointed out, this powder does require a bit more effort to blend well and dissolve into smoothies. For those who are texture-phobic, this may be an issue, but I personally have never had a problem with it. Mixing it with yogurt has always given it a more creamy texture.\u201d\nProtein Serving: 21 grams | Calories: 130 | Flavors: Strawberries and Cream, Pumpkin Spice, Horchata, Birthday Cake, more\nBest Pea Protein Powder: Vega Original Protein Powder\nPros:\n- Utilizes pea protein for a more natural vegan protein\n- Zero sugar\nCons:\n- Some reviewers say it is less filling\nEnjoy 25 grams of protein per serving, with this non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free recipe. You may be wondering what\u2019s left in Vega, given that it\u2019s such a clean option. That would be pea-protein, which aids in digestion, keeps you fuller longer, and adds some fiber and iron to your diet, per Healthline.\nEditor\u2019s Note: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there is zero sugar in Vega\u2019s Original Protein Powder. Their pea-based formula still delivers ample protein and fuels me up for a pre-workout. I think that 25 grams of protein is the sweet spot for me, and I\u2019ve never experienced any negative side effects while taking this formula. I will say that it is a bit less filling than other protein powders, so I wouldn\u2019t count on replacing a meal with it.\u201d\nProtein Serving: 25 grams | Calories: 180 | Flavors: Vanilla, Creamy Chocolate, Raspberry Blackberry, Chocolate\nBest Vegan High Protein Powder: Vega Sport Premium Protein Powder (Vanilla)\nPros:\n- High protein per serving\n- Ingredients that help with inflammation\nCons:\n- Some reviewers mention flavor is a bit artificial\nContaining all nine essential amino acids, this vegan protein powder is especially great for those who are looking to build muscle, thanks to its leucine content from those EAAs \u2014 according to our experts. Some reviewers also noted that the vegan recipe and key ingredients can help reduce inflammation.\n\u201cI chose the Vega Sport over some of the other Vega options because I have arthritis in my hip and the Vega Sport contains a number of ingredients that help with inflammation (turmeric and tart cherry are two of these) and the lack of animal proteins is beneficial too since I\u2019m just not ready to go full vegetarian in my daily life but I am trying to limit things that can trigger my inflammation when I can,\u201d one customer explained.\nProtein Serving: 30 grams | Calories: 170 | Flavors: Vanilla, Berry, Peanut Butter, Mocha, more\nBest Collagen Protein Powder: Bulletproof Vanilla Collagen Peptides Powder with MCT Oil\nPros:\n- Grass-fed and pasture-raised\n- Mixes easily into liquids\n- Unique collagen formula\nCons:\n- Fewer flavor options\nWhile this may not be your traditional protein powder, Collagen Peptides still provide an array of nutrients that have been shown to help build stronger bones, joints, hair, skin, and nails, according to Healthline. Collagen peptides are found in commonly eaten proteins, but Bulletproof\u2019s recipe condenses them into a powder so you can ensure you\u2019re getting an ample supply.\nEditor\u2019s Note: \u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long to discover collagen powder \u2014 it seems to be the new gym-influencer-approved health hack. I use it in my coffee every morning, and can hardly tell it\u2019s there (it dissolves like a dream). In addition to some of the physical benefits that collagen brings, I\u2019ve noticed my focus, mood, and energy levels improve over time. I highly recommend using this in addition to a protein powder, if not letting it stand alone.\u201d\nProtein Serving: 20 grams (collagen) | Calories: 140 | Flavors: Vanilla, Chocolate, Unflavored\nHow often should protein powder be consumed?\n\u201cProtein powders are a \u2018supplement\u2019 and not a \u2018food,\u2019 so there isn\u2019t a specific nutritional\nrecommendation to consume the protein powders,\u201d Dr. Garden-Robinson explains. \u201cIf you can\u2019t meet your nutrition needs due to some underlying conditions, protein powders\ncould help meet the goals.\u201d\nWhen selecting a protein supplement, she recommends referring to the Recommended Daily Amount (RDA) on the label and following those recommendations. \u201cConsuming extra calories through protein can promote weight gain,\u201d she adds.\nDoes how much protein powder consumed depend on body weight?\n\u201cThe usual recommendation is 0.8 grams per kilogram body weight (one kilogram is 2.2\npounds.),\u201d Dr. Garden-Robinson said. \u201cAccording to some nutrition experts, people over age 50 often need close to double the RDA (1.5 grams per kilogram body weight) to avoid muscle loss.\u201d\nBut, there isn\u2019t a hard science to this. \u201cIf you want to lose or gain weight, you would adjust your calorie intake accordingly. That\u2019s where working with a professional is especially valuable.\u201d\nShould protein powder be consumed before or after working out?\n\u201cA common edict in the exercise field is to consume protein immediately after an exercise bout to facilitate muscular repair and remodeling, in hopes to enhance post-exercise strength-and hypertrophy-gains,\u201d Dr. Abou Sawan said. \u201cHowever, this edict is not supported by scientific evidence as consuming protein in and around the post-exercise period has not been shown to appreciably increase muscle mass.\u201d\nSo, he classified this as \u201cgood news\u201d because your workout wasn\u2019t a waste if you didn\u2019t consume protein immediately after your workout.\nBut, a good rule of thumb to follow, per Dr. Garden-Robinson, is, when in doubt, consume protein powder within an hour after working out. \u201cThat\u2019s when your muscles are recovering from working out,\u201d she said.\nHow do I check if a protein powder is \u201cclean\u201d or \u201csafe\u201d?\nIt\u2019s important to note that protein powder isn\u2019t regulated by the FDA, though third-party companies often test the viability of certain protein powders to determine the accuracy of the labels.\nSome of these firms include Labdoor and Clean Label Project, both of which we referenced for this article.\nOur experts\nBelow, find backgrounds on our two experts and their strong resume on protein:\n- Julie Garden-Robinson, PHD, RD, LRD: A professor and food and nutrition specialist at North Dakota State University whose background is in food science and nutrition. She works to develop materials and perform outreach that reaches children and adults of all ages. She has also written about protein powders and has done research/outreach about various protein sources including plant and animal foods.\n- Sidney Abou Sawan, PhD, MSc, CSCS: A protein researcher who completed his PhD and MSc at the University of Toronto within the Department of Exercise Sciences and specialized in skeletal muscle protein metabolism. Herein, he focused on the mechanisms underpinning muscle protein synthesis in response to protein ingestion and exercise. He\u2019s currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at McMaster University investigating muscle protein synthesis in response to plant-based protein blends.\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\nFor over 200 years, the New York Post has been America\u2019s go-to source for bold news, engaging stories, in-depth reporting, and now, insightful shopping guidance.

Our athletic electrolyte drink powder is handmade in the United States. We use real sugar, real fruit, clean salt and toxin-free ingredients. It provides the exact ratio needed to prepare and refuel the body. Try it and observe the power of SPORT DRINK.\nAdd 1Tbsp to 10-12oz of filtered, un-fluoridated water and enjoy.\nProudly Made in the USA\nSPORT DREAM\n- NO MELATONIN\n- NO ASHWAGANDHA\n- NO VALERIAN ROOT\n- NO STEVIA OR MONK FRUIT\n- NO SUGAR ALCOHOLS\n- NO CHEMICAL FILLERS\nDO STRAWBERRIES DREAM OF ELECTRIC CREAM? is our first-ever sleep formula\u2014and the world\u2019s first sleep formula that utilizes a trio of unconventional ingredients that, once you try them, make perfect sense. Designed to replicate the way you feel after eating high-quality ice cream before bed, it\u2019s built on the holy trinity of Sugar, Fat, and Salt.\nOUR INGREDIENTS\nBAJA GOLD\u2122 MINERAL SEA SALT\nBaja Gold is an unrefined mineral sea salt harvested from the Sea of Cortez, packed with trace minerals and essential nutrients your body depends on to power muscle contractions, regulate blood pressure, support nerve function, and produce cellular energy.Unlike regular salt or other refined varieties, it retains its macro minerals and trace elements in their natural form, supporting hydration, energy, and whole-body wellness. Baja Gold's salt is free from synthetic additives, chemical processing, and anti-caking agents, so you get real salt with real benefits.\nMAGNESIUM GLYCINATE\nYou need magnesium for nearly every function in your body. Because of the low quality of soil our food is grown in, many of us are deficient in this mineral.\nMagnesium Glycinate is a highly bioavailable form of magnesium, known for its effective absorption and gentle impact on the digestive system.\nImproved muscle and sleep recovery as well as bone health, heart health and blood sugar regulation are some of its most notable benefits.\nLEMON & LIME POWDER\nOur proprietary method of drying Organic Lemon & Lime Juice is superior to both spray drying and freeze drying because it does not use synthetic fillers. Our drying process retains substantially more of the flavor, and nutrients of the fruit. We don't believe in hiding behind the \"natural flavors\" liability shield. The flavor in SPORT DRINK comes from real fruit. The added benefit of this is both of these fruits provide essential minerals and nutrients that your body needs to rehydrate and replenish itself after strenuous physical activity. You're welcome.\nDue to the chemical makeup of the sodium bicarbonate reacting with the citric acid in the lemon and lime, you will experience a pleasant fizzy effect.\nPURE CANE SUGAR\nStop drinking Stevia! Did you know that stevia was originally used by native peoples as a contraceptive? Yeah, didn't think so... Anyway, look, your body needs carbohydrates in order to recover and perform at peak levels. The best tasting way (in our opinion) to recover these lost carbs is by drinking sugar in its purest unadulterated form. Organic cane sugar is good for you (read our manifesto).\nSODIUM BICARBONATE\nAlso known as Baking Soda, Sodium Bicarbonate is a popular supplement amongst athletes that allows you to perform longer at your peak, especially during anaerobic exercises or high intensity training and sprinting.\nDue to its high pH, Sodium Bicarbonate helps to delay fatigue, letting you perform at max intensity for longer.\nPOTASSIUM CHLORIDE\nPotassium chloride is a salt-like compound that contains potassium and chloride. It comes in the form of white, colorless crystals and has a strong, salty taste. Potassium is necessary for proper hydration and function of the body and enhances muscle construction, nerve function, and heartbeat regulation. It also helps all your little cells function at optimal levels.\nWant to read more about our thoughts on sugar and why we believe it's good? Check out our in-depth sugar manifesto:\nIn the past few decades, the establishment and its foot soldiers have waged war on sugar. It has been demonized beyond imagination. As a result, many of the drinks in stores nowadays are sugar-free. Sugar substitutes like stevia, Sucralose, aspartame, and many more have taken the packaged food and drink world by storm. And nothing of value was gained..."
