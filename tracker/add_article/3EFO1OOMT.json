Kennedy Jr., was barred from serving on the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee after his term expired and paperwork was reportedly held up by HHS. The move follows Kennedy’s broader purge of CDC and FDA vaccine advisers amid accusations of conflicts of interest and a push for stricter vaccine oversight. Offit’s exclusion highlights tensions between public health experts and the current administration’s vaccine policy direction.",
