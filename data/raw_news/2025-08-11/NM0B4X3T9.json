  "description": "The judge's decision brings to a close a controversial criminal case for excessive force that top federal prosecutor Bill Essayli sought to have overturned despite a conviction by a jury.",
  "content": "Deputy Trevor Kirk is seen here in December 2023 in the Law Offices of Caree Harper for a deposition in federal civil rights case.\n\nA federal judge on Monday rejected U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli\u2019s request to dismiss charges against a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy who has already been convicted of a felony for using excessive force during a 2023 arrest, ordering him to start his prison sentence later this month.\n\nU.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said the government\u2019s effort to overturn a jury conviction was \u201ccontrary to the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe ruling brought to a close a controversial criminal case involving an unusual post-trial plea agreement, which triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May and ultimately saw the felony reduced to a misdemeanor.\n\nIn an 11-page ruling, Wilson cited a lack of new evidence or change in circumstances of the case in denying the motion to effectively erase the prosecution of L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Trevor Kirk.\n\n\u201cIf the Government truly thought that Defendant\u2019s conviction was not supported by adequate evidence, it could have moved to dismiss the entire case back in May. It did not do so. Since then, nothing has changed,\u201d Wilson wrote. \u201cThe Government did not uncover any new evidence. Nor did it develop any new reasons to disagree with the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d\n\nKirk was convicted in February of excessive force in a case filed under the previous U.S. Attorney for the Los Angeles region. But after Essayli, a staunch supporter of President Trump, was named top federal prosecutor for the area in April, he ordered a review of the case and sought its unraveling.\n\nA federal jury found Kirk guilty of a felony count of deprivation of rights under color after he violently threw a woman to the ground and pepper sprayed her outside a supermarket in Lancaster in 2023.\n\nProsecutors under Essayli asked in June that Kirk be sentenced to probation, but Wilson sentenced him to four months in prison. Last month, Wilson denied Kirk\u2019s motion to remain free while he appealed his conviction to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Wilson instructed Kirk to surrender on Aug. 28 and begin his prison sentence.\n\nIn the ruling made public Monday, Wilson said Essayli\u2019s push to spike all charges against Kirk was an attempt to subvert his prior ruling.\n\n\u201cThe motion is a direct attempt to override the Court\u2019s decision to sentence Defendant to four months in prison,\u201d Wilson wrote. \u201cIndeed, after the Court rejected its request for probation and imposed a custodial sentence, the Government responded by seeking to dismiss all charges\u2014ensuring Defendant serves no time at all.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Los Angeles declined to comment. Kirk\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCaree Harper, who has served as a victim\u2019s rights attorney for the woman Kirk was convicted of assaulting, celebrated the ruling as a minor victory in the face of Essayli\u2019s broader assault on the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that there\u2019s something. Of course it\u2019s not the felony we were hoping for back in May but thank god there was some type of punishment that\u2019s going to be served on Mr. Kirk. Hopefully [President] Trump does not intervene,\u201d Harper said, referring to concerns that Kirk could receive a pardon after some of his supporters appealed to Trump directly last year.\n\nLate last month, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the case and vacate the judgment against Kirk, citing \u201cmisgivings about the case.\u201d They also moved to drop charges in another controversial criminal case involving Andrew Wiederhorn, former chief executive of the company that owns the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets chains. A court has since signed off on motions to dismiss the charges against Weiderhorn, records show.\n\nThe motions to dismiss came the same day that the Trump administration moved to extend Essayli\u2019s term as L.A.\u2019s top federal law enforcement official, despite flouting the normal confirmation process for prosecutorial appointees. He has since been named acting U.S. attorney.\n\nWilson questioned whether the government filed the motion to dismiss because he did not sentence Kirk to probation.\n\n\u201cThis is your Hail Mary,\u201d Wilson said during a recent hearing on the matter. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left.\u201d\n\nEssayli\u2019s decision to offer the deputy a lenient post-conviction plea deal triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May, including the heads of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights sections.\n\nIn a federal court filing last week, Jacy Houseton, the victim in Kirk\u2018s case, objected to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, calling it \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cunjustified.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Attorney has now effectively become the advocate for the bad guys in broad daylight,\u201d wrote Houseton\u2019s attorney, Harper.\n\nKirk had been responding to a reported robbery at a Lancaster supermarket in 2023, when Houseton approached him in the parking lot. Houseton was filming Kirk at the time but was not armed or committing a crime.\n\nIn his opening statement during Kirk\u2019s trial on Feb. 4, Asst. U.S. Atty. Brian R. Faerstein told jurors Kirk used excessive force against Houseton by slamming her to the ground and pepper spraying her \u201cwhen it was unnecessary to do so.\u201d\n\nKirk and his defense team have argued Houseton matched the description of a suspect given to Kirk as he responded.\n\nIn handing down the four-month sentence, Wilson said that, in his view and the jury\u2019s view, Kirk\u2019s actions were \u201cjust plain inexplicable.\u201d He said that Kirk \u201cknew there was no danger to himself or anyone else,\u201d before he pepper-sprayed Houseton.\n\nProsecutors are generally given wide latitude on how they handle active prosecutions. But in a case such as Kirk\u2019s, in which prosecutors are seeking to dismiss charges without presenting any new evidence after a defendant has been convicted by a jury, there is less precedent.\n\nAsst. U.S. Atty. Robert J. Keenan told the judge that the office found no new evidence but argued not enough attention had been paid to \u201cacts of resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t the jury see all that,\u201d Wilson questioned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of how it\u2019s presented and how it\u2019s characterized,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not comfortable with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was there on the tape almost from the beginning to the end,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis evidence was clearly recorded ... The jury saw all of it.\u201d\n\nAfter the hearing last week, activists confronted Keenan in the hallway, telling him \u201cthis is bigger than Kirk.\u201d\n\nAmong them was Raycine Ector, the lead organizer of Cancel the Contract Antelope Valley, a community coalition advocating for ending contracts between the Sheriff\u2019s Department and local cities and schools.\n\n\u201cYou are violating this criminal justice system,\u201d Ector said. \u201cWhat about the victim?\u201d",

      "text": "How L.A.\u2019s new top federal prosecutor erased felony verdict in deputy\u2019s excessive force case\n- Share via\nIt took a federal jury an hour to convict a Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s deputy of using excessive force after he assaulted and pepper-sprayed a woman outside a supermarket in Lancaster in 2023.\nThe prosecutors made their case in a three-day trial in February, ultimately persuading jurors to find Trevor Kirk guilty of a felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law. Kirk faced up to 10 years in prison.\nOn Monday, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson sentenced Kirk to four months in prison, after last week granting the government\u2019s request to dismiss the felony charge. With that dismissal, Kirk faced up to a year in prison.\nAhead of sentencing, the government had requested probation that included three months of home detention and 200 hours of community service. The defense team asked for a term of two months of home confinement and 300 hours of community service.\n\u201cIn my view, the jury verdict was fully supported and the case was not unfairly argued, as the government at some early point argued,\u201d Wilson said after handing down his sentence. \u201cThe job of a police officer is a very difficult one ... but with those factors in mind, there is a responsibility to act appropriately.\u201d\nKirk declined to speak during the sentencing hearing. Tom Yu, an attorney representing Kirk, said they plan to appeal Wilson\u2019s earlier denial of their motion for an acquittal.\nThe Baker to Vegas relay is a law enforcement tradition. This year it was a showcase for turmoil in the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nThe sentencing capped a controversial case that saw the federal government abandon a conviction and take the highly unusual legal step of offering Kirk a misdemeanor plea deal after jurors had spoken. That plea deal played a role in the resignation of several federal prosecutors last month and raised concerns over how the office will handle pending cases against law enforcement.\nThe post-trial plea agreement landed the same week President Trump issued an executive order vowing to \u201cunleash\u201d American law enforcement, and it followed other recent controversies that have raised alarms about the eroding independence of the U.S. Justice Department under the Trump administration.\nSeated in the front row of the packed courtroom Monday was U.S. Atty. for Los Angeles Bill Essayli, a staunch Trump ally and hard-line conservative who was appointed in April and under whom the felony verdict unraveled.\nApproached after the hearing, Essayli declined to comment.\nAn indictment\nA federal jury indicted Kirk last September in connection with the incident, in which the deputy \u2014 who was responding to a robbery report \u2014 threw a woman to the ground and pepper-sprayed her in the face while she filmed him outside a WinCo.\nAlthough the woman matched the description of a suspect Kirk had received from a dispatcher, she was not armed or committing a crime when he confronted her, court records show.\nBefore the case went to trial, according to a motion filed by Asst. U.S. Atty. Robert J. Keenan, the government was willing to enter into a plea agreement that would have allowed Kirk to plead to a misdemeanor. Kirk instead took his chances on a jury trial and lost.\nIn January, Nick Wilson, founder of a first-responder advocacy group and spokesperson for the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Professional Assn., wrote to Trump urging him to intervene before the case went to trial. In the letter, he said left-wing activists wanted to make an example of Kirk.\n\u201cThis case is about more than just one deputy, it\u2019s about the survival of law and order in America,\u201d he wrote, according to screenshots of the letter posted on social media.\nAn L.A. County sheriff\u2019s deputy who was convicted of a felony for assaulting and pepper-spraying an unarmed woman will now face only a misdemeanor under a judge\u2019s ruling Tuesday.\nThe trial went ahead anyway.\nIn his opening statement on Feb. 4, Asst. U.S. Atty. Brian R. Faerstein told jurors Kirk had used excessive force against the victim, Jacy Houseton, by slamming her to the ground and pepper spraying her \u201cwhen it was unnecessary to do so.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of this trial, the United States will ask you to hold the defendant accountable for abusing his power and authority,\u201d Faerstein said.\nKirk\u2019s attorney told the jury the deputy had relied on his training to deal with a \u201cresistant suspect.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a world of difference between a use of force and excessive force,\u201d Yu said.\nTwo days later, the jury returned with a guilty verdict.\nA new U.S. attorney\nEssayli was sworn in as the new U.S. attorney on April 2. The following week, prosecutors on the Kirk case filed a motion to delay the sentencing hearing because Essayli wanted to review the case.\nWhen asked about the review, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said former U.S. Atty. Martin Estrada in March 2023 established an executive position within the office to address ethics and post-conviction issues.\nThe office said it gets requests to review cases pre-and post-conviction, but declined to comment on how many cases have been reviewed since 2023. Estrada did not respond to an email seeking comment on the Kirk case last week.\nSoon after his appointment, Essayli requested that the Riverside County district attorney\u2019s office \u201cconduct an independent and impartial review of the case and evidence in the Kirk matter,\u201d according to Dist. Atty. Mike Hestrin.\n\u201cI assigned a team of experienced investigators and prosecutors to thoroughly review the evidence and case details, evaluating what, if any, charges we would consider for prosecution had the case been submitted to us for potential filing,\u201d Hestrin said in a statement.\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on why Essayli involved the Riverside County district attorney\u2019s office in a federal case out of Lancaster. A legal expert called the move highly unusual.\n\u201cI think it looks like he was trying to shore up evidence to find the result he was looking for. The fact that he went outside the office is an indication he wasn\u2019t getting the support that he wanted from the prosecutors within the office,\u201d said Carley Palmer, a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, who is now a partner at Halpern May Ybarra Gelberg LLP.\nWith the allegations of partisanship swirling around the case, Palmer also questioned why Essayli didn\u2019t ask the Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office to lead the review, given Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman\u2019s status as a political independent.\n\u201cIt does seem like if you were looking for additional takes on this case, it might make sense to go to the former federal prosecutor now working across the street now managing the county where the crime took place,\u201d said Palmer.\nMultiple federal prosecutors in Los Angeles submitted resignations after U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli offered a plea agreement to an L.A. County sheriff\u2019s deputy who had already been convicted of using excessive force, sources told The Times.\nA spokesman for the L.A. County district attorney\u2019s office said Essayli has never contacted Hochman about the Kirk case.\nIn April, Wilson denied a motion from Yu for an acquittal. The judge ruled that footage of the incident was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Kirk used \u201cobjectively unreasonable force.\u201d\nOn April 22, the judge refused the government\u2019s request to postpone Kirk\u2019s sentencing.\nTwo days later, according to Hestrin, the Riverside County prosecutors and investigators Essayli tapped to review the case attended a meeting in L.A. with the U.S. attorney and his staff to present their findings and recommendations.\nWhen asked what those findings and recommendations were, the Riverside County district attorney\u2019s office referred that question to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, which declined to comment.\nOn May 1, the government filed a \u201cpost-trial\u201d plea agreement under which Kirk would plead guilty to misdemeanor violation of deprivation of rights under color of law. The downgrade to a misdemeanor is significant as Kirk would have lost the right to be a law enforcement officer or own a gun with a felony conviction.\nThe only assistant U.S. attorney who signed off on the plea agreement, Robert J. Keenan, was not previously involved in the case. The next day, the original prosecutors involved all withdrew from the case.\nLast week, Wilson rejected the plea agreement \u2014 which recommended that Kirk be sentenced to probation. But the judge granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to lessen the charges against the deputy to a misdemeanor, despite the jury conviction.\nSentencing\nMore than 50 people packed the courtroom for the sentencing hearing Monday, including former Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who has championed Kirk\u2019s case online. Before the proceeding began, supporters embraced Kirk, who wore a cross-shaped pin that bore the American flag.\nKeenan told the judge that the government believed a prison sentence to be \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cunreasonable.\u201d\nIn handing down his sentence, Wilson said that, in his view and the jury\u2019s view, Kirk\u2019s actions were \u201cjust plain inexplicable.\u201d He said that Kirk \u201cknew there was no danger to himself or anyone else,\u201d before he pepper sprayed Houseton.\n\u201cThis was pretty awful,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYes, it wasn\u2019t as terrible as many cases or most cases I see, but this is the case before me. In my view, it can\u2019t go unpunished. ... This is the way the court feels the ends of justice are achieved.\u201d\nIn a sentencing recommendation obtained by The Times, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna asked Wilson to sentence Kirk to probation, blaming his actions that day on poor training, stemming from the fact that the Sheriff\u2019s Department had not properly followed reforms ordered by the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division.\nKirk remains a sheriff\u2019s deputy, according to an agency spokeswoman, but an internal investigation into his conduct that could result in termination will now move forward since the criminal case is complete.\n\u201cWe uphold the highest standards of conduct for our personnel and expect them to serve our communities with integrity,\u201d LASD said in a statement. \u201cNo badge grants our personnel immunity from accountability.\u201d\nKirk agreed to surrender himself on Aug. 28.\nIn another twist, Caree Harper, who has represented Houseton, filed a petition Monday morning with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals requesting that it vacate the dismissal that reduced Kirk\u2019s conviction from a felony to a misdemeanor.\nThe 9th circuit responded after Kirk was sentenced, stating that the petition \u201craises issues that warrant an answer.\u201d The court directed the government to file an answer by Tuesday."

      "text": "Feds move to drop charges in controversial cases as Trump re-ups L.A. prosecutor\n- Share via\nJust hours after the Trump administration moved to extend U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli\u2019s term as Los Angeles\u2019 top federal law enforcement official, prosecutors moved to dismiss charges in a pair of controversial criminal cases, including one involving a donor to the president.\nIn a motion filed late Tuesday, federal prosecutors sought to dismiss an indictment accusing Andrew Wiederhorn, former chief executive of the company that owns the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets chains, of carrying out a $47-million \u201csham loan\u201d scheme.\nProsecutors also sought to dismiss charges against L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Trevor Kirk, who has already been convicted and sentenced in an excessive force case after he attacked a woman in a supermarket parking lot in 2023.\nThe Department of Justice has taken unusual steps to allow Bill Essayli to remain U.S. attorney for the Central District of California without Senate confirmation or judicial appointment.\nA spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. Both cases sparked significant controversy during Essayli\u2019s turbulent run as L.A.\u2019s top federal prosecutor.\nDays before Essayli\u2019s initial appointment in April, Adam Schleifer, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the criminal case against Wiederhorn, was fired at the behest of the White House.\nSchleifer alleged in appealing the decision that his firing was motivated in part by his prosecution of Wiederhorn, a donor to President Trump who has maintained his innocence.\nAccording to three sources familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly, Essayli had a meeting with Wiederhorn\u2019s defense team shortly after he was appointed. The meeting included former U.S. Atty. Nicola T. Hanna, who the sources said was in charge of the office when the investigation into Wiederhorn began and is now on his defense team.\nAccording to those sources, Essayli suggested shortly after the meeting that the case against Wiederhorn could be dismissed if Essayli were permanently appointed.\n\u201cFrom day one, we have maintained Andy\u2019s innocence,\u201d Hanna said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe are extremely grateful that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office listened to our arguments and determined, in the interests of justice, that all charges should be dropped.\u201d\nHanna has not responded to requests for comment about the prior meeting with Essayli, who also did not respond to inquiries.\nAn ex-assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles has filed a claim calling his dismissal \u201cunlawful\u201d and alleging it was motivated in part by his prosecution of the ex-CEO of the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets restaurant chains.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed Essayli would be named acting U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, a move that extends his term an additional 210 days.\nUnder normal procedures, U.S. attorneys must receive Senate confirmation or be appointed by a federal judicial panel. But facing opposition to Trump\u2019s picks in the Senate, the administration has used a similar tactic to skirt legal norms and keep its chosen prosecutors in power in New York, New Jersey and Nevada in recent weeks.\nThe indictment against Wiederhorn also alleged he was aided by the company\u2019s former chief financial officer, Rebecca D. Hershinger, and his outside accountant, William J. Amon. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office moved to dismiss the indictment against all three defendants, as well as charges against their company, Fat Brands.\n\u201cWe have said Rebecca Hershinger was innocent,\u201d attorney Michael J. Proctor of the law firm Iversen Proctor said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful that the government has acknowledged the case should be dismissed.\u201d\nWiederhorn was also under indictment on a gun charge, which prosecutors moved to dismiss as well. Wiederhorn is banned from possessing firearms after he pleaded guilty in 2004 to charges of paying an illegal gratuity to his associate and filing a false tax return. He spent 15 months in prison and paid a $2-million fine.\nLate Tuesday, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office also moved to dismiss an indictment against Alejandro Orellana, a 29-year-old ex-Marine who had been accused of aiding in civil disorder for passing out gas masks during large-scale protests against immigration raids in Southern California.\nA spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. Orellana\u2019s case was one of the few indictments Essayli\u2019s prosecutors had won related to alleged misconduct during the protests, and Essayli had fervently defended the charges when questioned by a Times reporter last month.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t handing masks out at the beach. ... They\u2019re covering their faces. They\u2019re wearing backpacks. These weren\u2019t peaceful protesters,\u201d Essayli said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t holding up signs, with a political message. They came to do violence.\u201d\nOrellana issued a statement Tuesday that declared: \u201cProtesting is not a crime. Defending my community is not a crime.\u201d\n\u201cI want to thank all the supporters across the country who mobilized to get the charges dropped,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won because we\u2019re on the right side of history and our cause is just.\u201d\nKirk, the sheriff\u2019s deputy, was convicted of deprivation of rights under color of law in February and faced up to 10 years in prison for hurling a woman to the ground and pepper spraying her while responding to a reported robbery at a Lancaster supermarket in 2023. The victim, Jacy Houseton, was filming Kirk at the time but was not armed or actively committing a crime.\nKirk and his defense team have argued Houseton matched the description of a suspect given to Kirk as he responded.\nKirk was set to self-surrender next month.\n\u201cWe support that obviously without any objections and I think it\u2019s within the confines of the law,\u201d Kirk\u2019s attorney, Tom Yu, said of the government\u2019s move to dismiss charges.\nEssayli had already successfully lowered Kirk\u2019s penalty to a misdemeanor, despite the fact that there had been no new evidence presented in the case. His decision to offer the deputy a lenient post-conviction plea deal triggered the resignations of several prosecutors in May, including the heads of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights sections. Kirk was sentenced to four months in jail in early June.\n\u201cThis is a long overdue correction to a case built on a false and politically charged narrative. Deputy Kirk did his job, and he was wrongfully prosecuted for it,\u201d said Nick Wilson, head of the Los Angeles Sheriffs Professional Assn., a deputy organization that had previously petitioned Trump to intervene in Kirk\u2019s case.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department declined to comment. Kirk remains a deputy on administrative leave.\nA judge must ultimately sign off on the motions to dismiss in all three cases. Prosecutors are generally given wide latitude on how they handle active prosecutions. But in a case like Kirk\u2019s, where prosecutors are seeking to dismiss a case after a conviction at jury trial without presenting any new evidence, there is less precedent.\nCaree Harper, who has represented Houseton, said she was notified Tuesday afternoon by Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Keenan of the plan to dismiss the indictment against Kirk.\nLos Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s deputy Trevor Kirk was sentenced Monday to four months in prison. He had previously faced up to 10 years in prison, until a federal judge granted the government\u2019s request to dismiss the felony charge.\n\u201cWe thought Trump\u2019s new U.S. Attorneys office could not stoop any lower, but it seems like Mr. Essayli & Mr. Keenan\u2019s insistence on being Trevor Kirk\u2019s BEST defense attorney has no limits,\u201d Harper said in an email.\nReached by phone, Harper called the news \u201cdisappointing and disheartening,\u201d citing the fact that the judge in the case \u201calready gave him an unbelievable break.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want him to spend one day in jail. They don\u2019t want him in cuffs at all,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThis is a travesty of justice yet again.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nCall forth the mourners from far and wide.\nAnd remind them to bring their chainsaws.\nWe gather to prepare ourselves to bid a frond farewell to Los Angeles\u2019 palm trees.\nLos Angeles knows how to weather a crisis \u2014 or two or three. Angelenos are tapping into that resilience, striving to build a city for everyone.\nDon\u2019t freak out. This isn\u2019t an alert about any wholesale dying of palms. Not all of them, anyway, and not right away. But Ecclesiastes got it right about everything having a season, \u201ca time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.\u201d\nThe season \u2014 the long, long winning season \u2014 for so many of our palm trees is running its course. Our exotic, come-hither, haphazard forest is being slowly timed out.\nWe stand at an inflection point for L.A., after the fires, in the grip of climate change, recalibrating our future right down to the roots. Literally to the roots. Uncounted thousands of trees burned in the fires. Thousands more are getting thinned out by disease and drought and age. How do we replace our geriatric urban forest with more and better trees?\nOriginal L.A. was not the forest primeval. It was a landscape of scrubby shrubs and chaparral and grasses. What native trees there were grew alongside water, which flowed abundantly, if seasonally, until we took over the land and dried up the waterways.\nPalm trees came to town with the missionaries, for religious ceremonies, and then, decades later, with the great PR sales pitch of Southern California being the \u201cAmerican Mediterranean,\u201d which demanded the right set dressing \u2014 palm trees.\nA veteran of the advertising business recalls a trick New Yorkers used to employ to get a trip to Los Angeles.\nThe City Beautiful movement of the 1910s and1920s and the glories of the 1932 Olympics stuck thousands of trees of all kinds into the ground to adorn public L.A. All they had to do was look good; to fret over drought or heat was treason.\nAngelenos\u2019 faith that pretty much anything could grow here was usually right. The unlikeliest tree cuttings from the world over were carried here, adapted and came to elbow out the locals.\nThus, Los Angeles became a tree zoo.\nNow it\u2019s time to make it a tree ark, and not every species should make it aboard.\nClimate change changes cities. We can no longer afford freeloader trees, however glamorous. Palms suck down water like camels, but give back barely enough leafiness to shade a Hula-Hoop. Falling fronds can deliver a mean whack, and during fires, palms light up like a flare.\nThe nonprofit TreePeople has been trying to prep us for this for years.\nBryan Vejar is a master arborist who directs community forestry for TreePeople, and, yes, in fact, he does have a few thoughts on the topic, and this is the moment we need to hear them, so take it away, Mr. Vejar:\n\u201cTrees are not some cosmetic thing, some ornament. They\u2019re also critical infrastructure, like traffic signs and traffic lights. They have tremendous value for the health and safety of the community.\u201d\n\u201cWe should be planting trees that serve a greater range of ecological benefits. There\u2019s not just one clear answer. The trees we plant now have to be climate-adaptive for weather forecasts for 50 and 60 years.\u201d\n\u201cNative trees also support local wildlife, specifically ones endemic to our geographical biome. Pollinators, nesting birds, migratory birds and other species rely on them.\u201d\nCities are being urged to expand their urban tree canopy to mitigate the effects of climate change, but some are replacing mature shady trees with palms.\n\u201cNot a lot of trees check every box. You want trees that are very durable and very resilient, that can endure many different soil types in any given community.\u201d\nAll right, then. What\u2019s in, and what\u2019s out once we cart away old trees and/or plant new ones?\nOut: most palms. And don\u2019t replace them with something like crape myrtle, which is pretty but doesn\u2019t offer much shade for the space it takes up.\nMost eucalyptus, out. They\u2019re invasive below ground and tiki torches above.\nSweet gums, out; They\u2019re also invasive, triggering allergies, and dropping nasty, spiky balls like alien spoor. (Some trees appear on a city-approved list, but TreePeople gives them a \u201cbranches-down.\u201d)\nI share Vejar\u2019s loathing for the relentless \u201ctree of heaven,\u201d the deciduous plant that is sometimes called a stinking sumac. You see it everywhere; it not only crowds out natives, it also poisons the soil to kill off the competition and ruins biodiversity. Its leaves can also kill your dog. If you see one in your garden, kill it before it kills us.\nVejar\u2019s \u201cins\u201d include native oaks and some sycamores, black walnut trees, desert willows, drought-tolerant African sumac and Chinese pistache.\nFicus trees scrub away air pollution and cast vast shade, something vital when an urban forest can lower temperatures by 10 or 20 degrees. Ideal, right? Yet cities planted them unwisely alongside sidewalks, which their mature roots now crack and split.\n\u201cThe thing that makes it a workhorse for urban forests,\u201d says Vejar, \u201cis also what makes cities have to pay out millions in lawsuits from people tripping, ADA violations and such.\u201d\nSo, suppose the palms do take their last bow? Which understudy is ready to step onstage as our new arboreal star? Oaks and sycamores are too generic. Orange trees? Memento mori.\nBut the jacaranda \u2014 now there\u2019s beauty. Fast-growing, generous with shade, drought-tolerant and soil-forgiving. Bees and butterflies love them. And did I mention beautiful? That ultraviolet haze shimmering around a blossoming jacaranda delivers a moment of transcendent enchantment.\nSo what if the fallen petals are sticky? It\u2019s a small toll paid to glory. Like a wad of gum dropped on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."

      "text": "Agents detain student at gunpoint near school; safe zones to be expanded around LAUSD campuses\n- Share via\nLos Angeles Unified school police, staff and community volunteers will form protective perimeters around at least 100 schools when a new school year begins Thursday to help ensure the safe passage of children \u2014 an announcement that came on a day that immigration agents reportedly handcuffed, detained and drew their guns on a student outside Arleta High School in a case of mistaken identity, officials said.\nThe 15-year-old boy, a student with disabilities, was visiting Arleta High School with family members when federal agents detained him, L.A. Unified officials said. Family members intervened and, after a few tense moments, the agents released the boy. The school\u2019s principal also came out to assess the situation. Agents left behind some bullets on the sidewalk, apparently by mistake, which were collected by school police.\n\u201cSuch actions \u2014 violently detaining a child just outside a public school \u2014 are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country,\u201d school board member Kelly Gonez, who represents Arleta High, said in a social media post.\nA spokesperson from the Department of Homeland Security could not immediately be reached for comment.\nAcross Los Angeles Unified, parents, teachers and staff have expressed deep fears about school safety amid immigration raids. Citywide, leaders are concerned that children whose parents are living in the country without legal status will be kept home as families grapple with the climate of fear.\nL.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho spoke Monday at a news conference with Mayor Karen Bass near district headquarters. He said the district is doubling down on efforts to protect students and families by creating and expanding \u201csafe zones\u201d around campuses, before and after school, with the help of community workers, school police and local police departments.\nBass was not specific about what role the Los Angeles Police Department would play.\n\u201cThe school police and the Los Angeles Police Department have a strong working relationship and will continue to share information as appropriate as needed,\u201d Bass said. \u201cBut neither police departments assist with immigration enforcement and have not for many, many years. There will be adults in the community who will serve as eyes and ears on the street.\u201d\nAt least two mayors from smaller cities pledged direct police assistance in patrolling areas around schools.\nAlthough local police are not legally allowed to stop or interfere with federal law enforcement actions, authorities will alert parents along walking routes if agents are in the area. Also, they will trigger a communication chain to alert all nearby campuses of raids so that schools can take lockdown actions as necessary.\nThe public commitment was intended to reassure families that school will be a safe place and that officials also will do what they can to protect families on their way to and from campuses.\nIn a string of recent appearances, Carvalho has reviewed a list of measures taken by the nation\u2019s second-largest school system.\nThese included home visits and calls in recent weeks to more than 10,000 families considered at risk of immigration enforcement or at risk of not coming to schools. The school system also is distributing family preparedness packets, \u201call the information in one single form, in a multitude of languages,\u201d said Carvalho, with the goal of \u201cexplaining the rights of our children and their parents, but also providing easy access to the resources that we have available to all of them.\u201d\nThe district also has created a \u201ccompassion fund\u201d to provide general help for families, including legal assistance.\nIn addition to students from immigrant families, the school system also has more than 350 employees who are working legally but who could have their legal status revoked.\n\u201cThey continue to be the valiant, productive workers they are with us,\u201d Carvalho said last week.\nThe district is working to reroute buses to make transportation more accessible to families. For the most part, the busing system is used by students with disabilities \u2014 for whom transportation is legally required \u2014 and students attending magnet programs at campuses far from where they live.\nBut this could change when the parameter for riding a bus is safety. In this light, neighborhood proximity to bus stops matters a lot, because families can be exposed to immigration enforcement while traveling to and from a stop.\nThe buses themselves will be a considered an extension of the campus environment and federal agents will not be permitted to board them.\nThe Monday news conference took place at Roybal Learning Center, just west of downtown, which also is the headquarters of the L.A. Unified School Police Department, which is expected to have a role in monitoring immigration enforcement and potentially confronting it.\nOthers in attendance included members of the L.A. Board of Education as well as South Gate Mayor Maria Davila. West Hollywood Mayor Chelsea Lee Byers and Bell Mayor Mayor Ali Saleh.\nLos Angeles Unified covers an area totaling 710 square miles, which includes most of the city of Los Angeles, along with all or portions of 25 cities and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. About 4.8 million people live within school-district boundaries."

      "text": "The next \u2018Big One\u2019 on the San Andreas fault might not be the earthquake we expect, researchers say\n- Share via\n- A new report studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault.\n- While the recent quake could hold vital clues for California\u2019s next \u201cBig One,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author notes that, \u201cEarthquakes never come back exactly the same way.\u201d\nWhat could the next mega-earthquake on California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault look like?\nWould it be a repeat of 1857, when an earthquake estimated at magnitude 7.7 to 7.9 ruptured the fault from Monterey County all the way through Los Angeles County? Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County?\nDon\u2019t bet on an identical sequel.\nThat\u2019s the implication of a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas.\nThe earthquake ended up rupturing a much longer section of the fault than scientists expected, given the seismology of the region.\nThe implications of this study are that \u201cearthquakes never come back exactly the same way,\u201d Solene L. Antoine, a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech and the study\u2019s lead author, said in an interview.\n\u201cIt came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech.\nMarch\u2019s Mandalay earthquake devastated Myanmar, killing at least 3,791 people and an additional 63 people in Thailand. High-rise buildings were damaged as far away as Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and homes were damaged in the Ruili area of China. Damage was estimated at $1.9 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nIt was the most powerful earthquake in Myanmar in at least 79 years.\nThe magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine\u2019s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. That\u2019s the longest seismic rupture ever documented on a continent.\nBy comparison, California\u2019s 1906 earthquake ruptured 296 miles of the San Andreas fault; and the 1857 earthquake, 225 miles. Longer seismic ruptures have been found only on subduction megathrusts deep underneath the ocean.\nWhat\u2019s clear from the study is that while California\u2019s next \u201cBig One\u201d may share some characteristics of previously documented devastating quakes, it\u2019s unlikely to be an exact replay. As the recent experience in Myanmar shows, even well-documented faults can behave in surprising ways.\nThe next step is to develop a model simulating earthquakes over many millennia for the San Andreas fault, which the authors plan to do in the future. But the San Andreas fault \u201cis far more complex,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come soon, because it\u2019s quite a heavy calculation.\u201d\nStill, such simulations would provide a model of \u201call possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.\u201d\nFor instance, maybe the San Andreas fault will rupture in smaller, separate earthquakes, Avouac said.\nOr it could be a much larger earthquake \u2014 rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. Such a quake would be the largest simultaneous disaster in modern California history, with huge swaths of the state wracked by powerful seismic shaking all at once.\nBy comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake\u2019s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley \u2014 related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7.\nBut while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just expect the exact same thing to happen,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIt is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.\u201d\nSometimes, Avouac said, \u201cit\u2019s quiet for a long time, nothing happens ... stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,\u201d Avouac said.\nBut \u201csmaller\u201d earthquakes, in the minds of researchers, are still big to the layperson. In the study\u2019s simulations, there are periods where earthquakes around magnitude 7.7 are common. In other periods, earthquakes max out at magnitude 7.5 or so, but are more frequent.\nThe entire length of the Sagaing fault \u2014 including areas that didn\u2019t rupture in the March earthquake \u2014 is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate.\nThe fact that 317 miles of the Sagaing fault ruptured in March was surprising to scientists. Only about 170 miles had been quiet seismically for more than a century, having last ruptured in 1839.\nScientists call these \u201cseismic gaps\u201d \u2014 particular areas of a fault that haven\u2019t recently ruptured.\nGenerally, scientists would\u2019ve expected only this long-dormant 170-mile piece of the Sagaing fault to rupture, Avouac said, but not more recently ruptured sections. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956.\nInstead, even those fault segments ruptured in the big March earthquake.\nSo what gives?\nA possible explanation is the Sagaing fault\u2019s extraordinary smoothness. \u201cAnd people have observed that when the fault is very smooth, the rupture ... tends to propagate at a velocity\u201d so fast that it results in an \u201cextremely elongated rupture,\u201d Avouac said.\nThe study also published the results of a computer model simulation looking at how earthquakes might rupture along sections of the entire 750-mile long Sagaing fault. The code, developed by study coauthor Kyungjae Im of Caltech, suggests that over a hypothetical 1,400-year period, there would be no repeatable patterns.\nIn other words, earthquakes didn\u2019t seem to re-occur like clockwork, rupturing the same stretch of fault in a repeatable, predictable pattern.\n\u201cThere is complexity here. And this is because each time you have an earthquake, it redistributes the stress on the fault, which is going to influence the next earthquake,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cThere\u2019s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.\u201d\nThere is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a \u201cBig One\u201d simply won\u2019t ever strike California again.\n\u201cThere will be an earthquake at some point,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIf there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won\u2019t hold forever.\u201d\nFurther research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said.\nThe other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China."

      "text": "L.A. federal prosecutors resign over plea deal for convicted sheriff\u2019s deputy, sources say\n- Share via\nSeveral federal prosecutors \u2014 including the chief of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section \u2014 have submitted their resignations following a plea deal offered by the new U.S. attorney in Los Angeles to a sheriff\u2019s deputy who had already been found guilty of using excessive force.\nTwo sources confirmed to The Times that Assistant U.S. Attys Eli A. Alcaraz, Brian R. Faerstein and section chief Cassie Palmer resigned from the office over a \u201cpost-trial\u201d plea agreement filed Thursday in the case of Trevor Kirk, an L.A. County sheriff\u2019s deputy who was convicted of a felony for assaulting and pepper-spraying a woman outside a Lancaster supermarket.\nReached Saturday afternoon, Faerstein said he had no comment. None of the other prosecutors said to have resigned responded to inquiries. The sources who confirmed the resignations requested anonymity because they feared retaliation. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.\nKirk, who has been \u201crelieved of duty\u201d by the Sheriff\u2019s Department, was found guilty in February of one felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law and faced up to 10 years in prison. Under the plea deal filed Thursday, which still requires approval from a judge, he would serve a maximum of one year in prison. The government agreed to recommend a year of probation.\nAn L.A. County sheriff\u2019s deputy was found guilty of excessive force after an incident in which he threw a woman to the ground in Lancaster.\nIn June 2023, Kirk was responding to a reported robbery when he threw a woman to the ground and pepper-sprayed her in the face while she filmed him outside a Lancaster WinCo. Although the woman matched the description of a female suspect Kirk had received from a dispatcher, she was not armed or committing a crime at the time he first confronted her, court records show.\nUnder the new agreement, Kirk would plead guilty to a lesser-included misdemeanor violation of deprivation of rights under color of law.\nIf the plea is approved by the judge, according to the agreement, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office would \u201cmove to strike\u201d the jury\u2019s finding that Kirk injured the victim.\nAlcaraz, Palmer, Faerstein and another prosecutor, Michael J. Morse, all withdrew from the case on Friday, according to court filings. The only assistant U.S. attorney who signed off on the plea agreement, Robert J. Keenan, was not previously involved in the case.\nBill Essayli, appointed U.S. attorney for Los Angeles last month by President Trump, is also listed on the agreement.\nThe attorney general has selected Riverside County Assemblymember Bill Essayli \u2014 a rising and controversial Republican voice \u2014 to serve as interim U.S. attorney for L.A. and surrounding areas.\nKirk\u2019s attorney, Tom Yu, declined to comment Friday evening. Previously, he described Kirk as a \u201chero, not a criminal\u201d and said video showed he acted within the law to \u201cdetain a combative robbery suspect.\u201d\nEssayli\u2019s move to offer a misdemeanor plea to a defendant who had already been convicted was extremely unorthodox, according to Carley Palmer, a former supervisor in the federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Los Angeles who is now a partner at Halpern May Ybarra Gelberg.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented, but it is extraordinary, to try to have a jury verdict withdrawn and replaced by a plea agreement to a lesser crime. The government invests extraordinary resources to take a case like that to trial,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have the agency\u2019s investigation, you have all the man or woman hours ... then you have a jury that says you got it right beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nTo justify seeking a post-conviction plea deal, prosecutors would need to have found evidence that the defendant was innocent or that there was some serious misconduct on the part of the trial team, according to Palmer.\nLast month, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson denied a motion from Yu for an acquittal. Wilson ruled footage of the incident was sufficient evidence for a jury to find Kirk had used \u201cobjectively unreasonable force.\u201d\n\u201cJ.H. did not have a weapon, did not attack Defendant, was not attempting to flee, and was not actively committing a crime,\u201d Wilson wrote, identifying the woman involved by initials.\nThe judge also noted in his ruling that while Kirk acted aggressively toward the woman from the outset, his partner managed to lead the arrest of the other robbery suspect without using force.\nThere are noticeable differences in the way the new plea agreement describes what Kirk did, as compared with a press release issued by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in February when the jury returned a guilty verdict.\nThe agreement makes references to the woman having \u201cresisted\u201d Kirk\u2019s attempt to detain her and describes her as \u201cswatting\u201d at the deputy\u2019s arm.\nIn his ruling last month, Wilson determined this could have been seen as the victim reacting reflexively to Kirk\u2019s actions, and noted it\u2019s unclear if she even hits Kirk.\nThe plea agreement also makes no reference to the woman\u2019s injuries, while the February release says she \u201cwas treated for blunt-force head trauma and injuries to her head, arms, and wrist.\u201d\nAttorney Caree Harper, who is representing the woman in a civil suit that reached a settlement earlier this year, said the new plea deal is \u201cchanging the facts\u201d and is not supported by video footage of the incident.\nThe recent firing of a federal prosecutor in L.A. who had criticized Trump and was leading a case against one of the president\u2019s supporters reflects a larger campaign against lawyers accused of opposing the administration\u2019s agenda.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking creative liberty with the facts and deciding to give a jury of Trevor Kirk\u2019s peers the middle finger and it should not be tolerated,\u201d she told The Times. If Wilson approves the agreement, Harper said, she expects civil rights groups will launch protests and urge state or county prosecutors to take up the case.\nHarper noted that downgrading Kirk\u2019s charge from a felony could allow him to continue working as a law enforcement officer. He will also retain his right to own a firearm without a felony conviction.\n\u201cHe definitely should not be able to wear a badge again, anywhere in any state,\u201d she said.\nAccording to Robert Bonner, a former federal judge who now chairs the county\u2019s Civilian Oversight Commission, a post-conviction plea deal is an extreme rarity. Allowing pleas after trial, Bonner said, could undermine prosecutors\u2019 ability to negotiate in the future.\n\u201cIf you did this routinely, you could never get a plea bargain,\u201d he said.\nEven though federal prosecutors and the defense have both agreed to the deal, Bonner said, the judge doesn\u2019t have to adhere to it.\n\u201cHe could reject the whole plea deal, or he can accept the plea deal and say I\u2019m not going to give one year probation, I\u2019m going to give six months in custody or some other period of time up to one year in prison,\u201d he said.\nWilson last month refused to delay Kirk\u2019s May 19 sentencing hearing, after prosecutors told him Essayli wanted more time to review the case.\nSupport for Kirk began gaining steam on social media after his indictment last September. In January, Nick Wilson, founder of a first responder advocacy group and spokesperson for the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Professional Assn., wrote a letter to Trump urging him to intervene before the case went to trial. Former Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who has become increasingly popular in right-wing circles online, has also championed Kirk\u2019s case, posting Instagram video of himself and Wilson consoling the deputy at the courthouse after trial.\nWilson, the Sheriff\u2019s Professional Assn. spokesperson, on Friday said he was \u201cencouraged by the recent development in Deputy Trevor Kirk\u2019s case and will continue to monitor the upcoming sentencing closely.\u201d\n\u201cWhile this case should never have been prosecuted in the first place, we are deeply grateful the Department of Justice took a second, impartial look at the facts and merits,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThis action sends a powerful message \u2014 not just in Trevor\u2019s case, but to law enforcement officers across the state and nation who too often feel abandoned or politically targeted in today\u2019s climate.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department did not immediately comment on the developments in Kirk\u2019s case.\nThe wave of resignations comes amid other recent controversy in the federal prosecutor\u2019s office. In March, a White House official fired Adam Schleifer as an assistant U.S. attorney, in a one-line email informing him that the dismissal was \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump.\u201d\nAn ex-assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles has filed a claim calling his dismissal \u201cunlawful\u201d and alleging it was motivated in part by his prosecution of the ex-CEO of the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets restaurant chains.\nSchleifer recently challenged his firing, calling it \u201cunlawful\u201d and alleging it was motivated in part by his prosecution of Andrew Wiederhorn, the former chairman and chief executive of Fat Brands, which owns the Fatburger and Johnny Rockets restaurant chains. Schleifer had also posted negative comments about Trump during a period when he had left his job as prosecutor to run for office as a Democrat.\nAccording to Meghann Cuniff, an independent legal affairs reporter, the Department of Justice is reviewing a separate case involving Alexander Smirnov, a former FBI informant who pleaded guilty to lying about a phony bribery scheme involving President Biden and his son Hunter. A federal judge sentenced Smirnov to six years in prison.\nThe turmoil in the L.A. federal prosecutor\u2019s office follows mass resignations in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan earlier this year, when several prosecutors stepped down after Trump administration appointees pushed to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams."

  "argos_summary": "A federal judge has ordered Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Trevor Kirk to begin serving a four-month prison sentence after he was convicted of using excessive force during a 2023 arrest. U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson rejected a motion from U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli to dismiss the charges against Kirk, emphasizing that the government's request lacked new evidence or justification. The case has sparked controversy, leading to the resignation of several federal prosecutors after a plea deal was offered to Kirk that downgraded his felony conviction to a misdemeanor, raising concerns about the integrity of the prosecution process.",
