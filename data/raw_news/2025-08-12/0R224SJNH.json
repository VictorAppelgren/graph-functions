  "title": "Reddit is blocking Wayback Machine from archiving users' posts",
  "description": "The social media platform claims it's to protect users' privacy, but money appears to be the more motivating factor.",
  "content": "Reddit will reportedly block the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine from saving users' posts. The social media platform states that the measure is intended to stop AI companies from scraping archived comments to train their algorithms. Or at least, prevent them from doing so without paying up.\n\nAs reported by The Verge, Reddit is preventing the Wayback Machine from archiving users' post detail pages, comments, and profiles. The Reddit homepage is still fair game, meaning that the titles of the top posts each day will still be preserved, but anything beyond that will no longer be indexed in the Internet Archive's digital library.\n\nReddit framed the decision as an effort to protect its users, stating that AI companies were violating its policies by scraping data from the Wayback Machine.\n\n\"Until [the Internet Archive is] able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy re. deleting removed content) we're limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors,\" Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt told The Verge.\n\nYet despite such assertions, Reddit has demonstrated that it's happy to hand over users' data to AI companies provided that they pay up. In 2024, Reddit barred search engines such as Microsoft Bing and DuckDuckGo from crawling its platform. However, a $60 million deal between Reddit and Google enabled the tech giant to continue training its AI algorithms on redditors' data, as well as surface their posts in Search. Reddit made a similar $60 million deal with ChatGPT creator OpenAI as well.\n\n\"Without these agreements, we don\u2019t have any say or knowledge of how our data is displayed and what it\u2019s used for, which has put us in a position now of blocking folks who haven\u2019t been willing to come to terms with how we\u2019d like our data to be used or not used,\" Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told The Verge last August.\n\nIronically, Reddit users themselves have little say in how the company uses their public posts, as it doesn't allow them to opt out of having such data sold or used to train AI algorithms. The only remedy for redditors to prevent such use is to simply stop posting to the platform altogether, though that still doesn't address posts they've previously made.\n\nThough concern for users' privacy may be a factor, Reddit's decision to block the Wayback Machine appears to be more obviously motivated by money. While AI companies were apparently scraping Reddit posts for free, cutting off such access will enable the social media platform to instead licence such data for a significant fee.\n\n\"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\" Huffman told the New York Times in 2023. \"But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\"\n\nReddit has been fighting to reduce its financial losses in recent years, resulting in widely unpopular changes such as charging developers for access to its application programming interface (API), removing the ability to opt out of ad personalisation, and the planned introduction of paid subreddits. Unfortunately, there's still a long way to go before Reddit claws itself out of the red. The self-professed \"heart of the internet\" reported a whopping net loss of $484.3 million last year \u2014 more than five times its $90.8 million net loss in 2023.",

He specifically named Microsoft, Anthropic, and Perplexity for refusing to negotiate, saying it has been \u201ca real pain in the ass to block these companies.\u201d\nReddit has been escalating its fight against crawlers in recent months. At the beginning of July, its robots.txt file was updated to block web crawlers it doesn\u2019t have agreements with. Then people began noticing that Reddit results were only visible in Google results \u2014 where Reddit is paid for its data to be shown \u2014 and not other search engines like Bing.\nHuffman said that Microsoft has been using Reddit\u2019s data to train its AI and summarizing its content in Bing results \u201cwithout telling us\u201d and that Reddit\u2019s data has also been sold through the Bing API to other search engines. In the interview, he referenced Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman\u2019s recent comment at a conference that public data on the internet is \u201cfreeware.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Microsoft, Anthropic, and Perplexity act as though all of the content on the internet is free for them to use,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cThat\u2019s their real position.\u201d\nIn response to Reddit results recently disappearing from Bing, Microsoft\u2019s head of search, Jordi Ribas, said on X that \u201cReddit has blocked Bing from crawling their site for search, favoring another search engine and impacting competition from Bing and Bing-powered engines.\u201d Microsoft spokesperson Caitlin Roulston separately told The Verge last week that \u201cwe honor the directions provided by websites that do not want content on their pages to be used with our generative AI models.\u201d\n\u201cThe traditional value exchange from search engines has changed\u201d\nHuffman pointed to OpenAI\u2019s recent announcement of SearchGPT, which will be able to show Reddit results thanks to a deal both companies reached earlier this year, as the model he wants to replicate. None of the content licensing deals Reddit has done to date include exclusive use cases for its data, according to spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt.\nBy calling for licensing deals, Reddit is joining more traditional media publishers (including The Verge\u2019s parent company, Vox Media) in seeking payment for letting their content feed generative AI. \u201cI think the traditional value exchange from search engines has changed,\u201d said Huffman. \u201cSearch and summarization and training are merging, and the value exchange of crawling in exchange for traffic back is becoming muddied.\u201d\nAfter this story was published, Anthropic spokesperson Jennifer Martinez sent the following statement: \u201cReddit has been on our block list for web crawling since mid-May and we haven\u2019t added any URLs from Reddit to our crawler since then. We respect robots.txt, the industry accepted signal for blocking web crawling.\u201d\nMicrosoft declined to comment for this story.

      "text": "A Reddit cofounder posted an AI video of his late mom, and it's dividing the internet\nOn Sunday, Alexis Ohanian posted a picture and short video on X, and less than 36 hours later, the post amassed 20.4 million views.\nThe picture was wholesome \u2014 one of Ohanian's favorite pictures of his late mother. In the photo, his mom embraces a young Ohanian in a warm hug as they sit in a sunny mountain meadow. That smiling boy would grow up to be one of the co-founders of Reddit, the husband to Serena Williams, and a parent himself. The picture is innocent enough on its own.\nHowever, it's the video that caught the internet's attention.\nUsing the new Midjourney AI video generator, Ohanian created a short video clip that animates the photo, bringing his mother to life in a new way. The pair beams as the woman hugs the young Ohanian and rocks him back and forth.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nMany of the responses were positive, with users sharing how touched they were by the video and Ohanian's message. In his post, the tech entrepreneur wrote, \"Damn, I wasn't ready for how this would feel. We didn't have a camcorder, so there's no video of me with my mom... This is how she hugged me. I've rewatched it 50 times.\"\nAnd in a follow-up post, he clarified, \"I lost my mom almost 20 years ago. Trolls can rest assured I\u2019ve grieved sufficiently. My family couldn\u2019t afford a camcorder and using tech to generate few seconds of animation from a still is the equivalent of using AI to stabilize a poorly recorded video \u2014 or fill in the gaps of a deteriorated video \u2014 of her (if we\u2019d had it). It\u2019s not a replacement for a loved one nor should it be.\"\nWhile many people found the video to be a beautiful expression of a son's love for his mother, others couldn't see past the AI. Some users reacted with revulsion and horror, likening AI videos like this to \"black tar heroin\" and a \"false memory.\"\nPersonally, I feel quite ambivalent about this application of AI. I can see how it would be immensely comforting, therapeutic, even. And I'm wary of injecting negativity where it's not needed. If Ohanian found the video moving on a spiritual or emotional level, then what right do I have to criticize or question him? (I reached out to Ohanian to ask if he has anything further to share, and I'll update this story if I receive a response.) Unlike controversies like the Studio Ghibli images from ChatGPT, I don't see how this post harms anyone.\nEven so, something about this gives me pause. It's the same feeling I get when standing on the edge of a cliff.\nGenerative artificial intelligence can now quickly make lifelike images, video, and speech, and I don't think the world is ready for the consequences. I don't think we even know what the consequences will be.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable.

However, the side effect of Reddit content disappearing from search engines is also unfortunate and doesn't bode well for the future of the internet.\nIt seems, however, that these are the consequences of search engine companies now becoming AI companies too.\nMashable has reached out to Reddit for confirmation and comment, and will update if we hear back."

      "text": "Reddit no longer showing in search results \u2013 unless it's Google search\nOver the past few years, Reddit has experienced surges of traffic from search engines. Why? Many internet users have adopted the practice of adding \"Reddit\" to the end of whatever they are searching for so they can find conversations and opinions from real people. Whether it be product reviews or travel recommendations, many people are looking to search within Reddit's archives of discussions to find what they want.\nNow, however, there seems to be only one search engine where users can actually do this.\nAs first discovered by the tech outlet 404 Media, Reddit has started blocking the vast majority of the internet's search engines from crawling and indexing their website. This means that Reddit posts are no longer coming up in search results for users on these platforms.\nThere is one exception though where users can still search Reddit \u2013 and that's Google.\nWhich search engines are affected and why?\nSearching Reddit now on popular search engines like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo turn up scant recent results from Reddit.com. As 404 Media reports, more recent Reddit links aren't turning up because they weren't crawled and indexed before Reddit made the change.\nA Mashable attempt to search Bing for any result from Reddit.com using \"site:reddit.com\" over the past week turns up zero results.\nReddit announced it was making a change to its Robots Exclusion Protocol (robots.txt) on its website on June 25. At the time, the company noted that it was making the change due to a surge of bots scraping its website. It did not seem from the statement at the time that this meant that organizations and platforms that legitimately help the broader internet and its users would be affected.\n\"Reddit believes in an open Internet, but not the misuse of public content,\" Reddit's protocol reads.\nBlocking search engines entirely from Reddit would certainly be a controversial move on its own. However, there is one search engine that is pulling up recent search results from Reddit: Google, the search engine that has a financial relationship with the Reddit.\nGoogle and Reddit's relationship\nEarlier this year, Reddit and Google entered into a $60 million deal that allows the search giant to use Reddit's content to train its AI models.\nIn statements provided to multiple outlets, Reddit states that its recent changes aren't related to its partnership with Google\n\"We block all crawlers that are unwilling to commit to not using crawl data for AI training, which is in line with enforcing our Public Content Policy and updated robots.txt file,\" Reddit said in a statement provided to Engadget.\nEngadget also claimed a source indicated that Reddit was excluded from search because Microsoft would not agree to the platform's terms regarding AI.\nReddit's move \u2014 if the speculation is true \u2014 seems fairly unprecedented, and highlights the hazards of a potential future where search engines become pay-to-play for even organic search results. Mashable has asked Reddit for comment, and will update this story if we find out more."

      "text": "Reddit wants to be your new search engine\nReddit, like nearly every major tech company right now, is going all-in on AI, and its next big bet is transforming itself into a full-blown search engine.\nThat\u2019s straight from Reddit CEO Steve Huffman. According to TechCrunch, Huffman told investors during the company\u2019s latest earnings call on Thursday: \"Reddit is one of the few platforms positioned to become a true search destination. We offer something special \u2014 a breadth of conversations and knowledge you can\u2019t find anywhere else.\"\nHe\u2019s not wrong. For years, internet users have added \"reddit\" to the end of their Google searches to filter past SEO sludge and find real human answers. The habit became so widespread that Google eventually baked Reddit content directly into its search results.\nBut Reddit doesn\u2019t want to be drowned out by Google\u2019s AI search push \u2014 it wants to be the answer. Like Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft, the company is focusing on \"its own\" AI-driven search experience. That effort centers around the website's search function and Reddit Answers, an AI-assisted tool that is powered by Gemini AI, according to Google.\nReddit Answers, which now serves 6 million users and is being tested in a dozen countries, functions much like ChatGPT, offering conversational, in-depth responses to user queries by pulling from the platform\u2019s massive archive of discussions. Instead of simply returning links or posts, it aims to synthesize answers in a more natural, AI-driven format.\nThe company plans to combine Reddit Answers with its core search function and redesign the app so the search bar takes center stage. According to Huffman, global expansion is on the way.\n\"We\u2019re unifying those [Reddit Search and Reddit Answers] into a single search experience, and we\u2019re gonna bring that front and center in the app,\" Huffman said in the call.\nIt\u2019s all part of Reddit\u2019s broader push to consolidate its user base and keep people on the platform, while also turning a solid profit. In Q2, the company reported a massive 78 percent revenue jump year-over-year, pulling in $500 million.\nTopics Reddit\nChance Townsend is the General Assignments Editor at Mashable, covering tech, video games, dating apps, digital culture, and whatever else comes his way.

      "text": "Reddit users in the UK must now upload selfies to access NSFW subreddits\nReddit has announced it will begin verifying the ages of users in the UK, responding to a new law coming into effect this month.\n\"[T]he UK Online Safety Act has new requirements to implement additional measures to prevent children from accessing age-inappropriate content,\" Reddit's chief legal officer Ben Lee aka u/traceroo posted to r/RedditSafety on Monday. \"So, starting July 14 in the UK, we will begin collecting and verifying your age before you can view certain mature content.\"\nInitially passed in 2023, the UK Online Safety Act requires all platforms that host certain restricted content to establish an age verification system by July 24. While many users turn to Reddit for primarily family-friendly matters, the platform also has a substantial collection of NSFW subreddits which would fall under the UK's new legislation.\nAs such, Reddit has partnered with Persona, a third-party age verification provider. Users in the UK who wish to access restricted content will need to upload either a selfie or their government ID, which Persona will use to verify that they are over 18. Users who don't pass this check will not be able to access such content, including that which is sexually explicit.\nReddit has stressed that this system is only to verify users' age, and it has no interest in your identity. Lee further stated that Persona won't know what subreddits you visit, and has promised it won't keep users' uploaded images more than seven days. Even so, having to upload their driver's license to access adult material will no doubt make many Reddit users uncomfortable.\n\"Reddit will not have access to the uploaded photo, and Reddit will only store your verification status along with the birthdate you provided so you won\u2019t have to re-enter it each time you try to access restricted content,\" wrote Lee (emphasis original). \"Your birthdate is never visible to other users or advertisers, and is used to support safety features and age-appropriate experiences on Reddit.\"\nWhile Reddit is only introducing Persona's age verification for users in the UK, it's also making changes in other regions. Lee also announced that the platform is introducing the option for users to provide their birthdate to \"optimize your Reddit experience.\" Specifically, Reddit states that this will enable them to tailor content and ads depending upon a user's age.\nLee further hinted at upcoming updates intended to confirm whether a user is an actual human or an AI bot, stating that there will be \"more to come about that later.\"\n\"We're carefully watching how the law evolves,\" they wrote. \"No specific timeline. And we continue to advocate for alternative approaches that don\u2019t require platforms to ask for id's.\"\nAge verification laws spark digital privacy concerns\nLee also indicated that Reddit may be pushing back against such age verification laws as they are currently formulated.\n\"Is Reddit just watching or is it fighting against such legislation?\" asked user u/shiruken. \"On a related note, why can't the digital wallets on smartphones enable age/identity verification for apps and services? They have your digital ID, why can't they offer endpoints for getting the owner's age and some kind of unique identifier?\"\n\"Gee, it's as if you were listening in on my conversations with regulators\u2026\" responded Lee.\nAs it stands, the UK Online Safety Act requires individual websites to collect users' information and verify their age, leaving it up to the platforms to ensure they comply with the law. Free speech and digital privacy experts have expressed serious concerns regarding such age verification requirements, stating that they're ineffective, unenforceable, and present considerable privacy risks.\nIn contrast, a device-based system would store verification of a user's age on their phone, tablet, computer, or on their device manufacturer's network. Such devices would have pre-installed blocks on restricted websites, which would only be lifted once the user's age has been verified.\nAdult content platform Pornhub has argued for device-based age verification systems for several years, claiming that it will allow for more consistent enforcement. Pornhub's parent company Aylo has agreed to verify UK users' ages in compliance with the new law, though it hasn't yet disclosed what information it will gather in order to do so. Aylo has already blocked multiple U.S. states due to their age verification laws.\nGovernments across the globe have paid considerable attention to online age verification in recent years. Australia is set to introduce age checks for people who use search engines while logged in to Google or Microsoft accounts, with the new requirements coming into effect from the end of this year. However, while experts agree that children should not access material that is inappropriate for their age, significant misgivings remain regarding the effectiveness of such age verification laws.\nTopics Reddit"

As of this update, the video player was glitchy, but in Mashable's tests, seemingly all files in the archive were once again available.\nYes, the world once again has access to mountains of digitized VHS tapes, .pdfs of old magazines, and countless other priceless treasures.\nJust a day after the Internet Archive posted the restoration of its Wayback Machine and other services on its blog, the site went dark again. As of original publication of this article, a visit to the Archive\u2019s homepage showed a message confirming that while Archive-It and its blog were back online, but the rest of the Internet Archive\u2019s services were unavailable. That has since changed, and the full archive is back up.\nMultiple outages made for a series of frustrating setbacks for users who rely on the digital library\u2019s vast resources, though details on who has caused this new disruption are still unclear. At original publication, it appeared that this was the fourth\u2014yes, fourth\u2014cyberattack on the Internet Archive since the beginning of October.\nThe first breach, on Oct. 9, saw two separate groups of hackers compromise the personal data of 31 million users, including emails, screen names, and encrypted passwords. Following that, a second and third attack targeted the Archive's Zendesk support system\u2014 with the hackers even responding to support requests sent to IA.\nThe timing of these attacks on the Internet Archive\u2014and other online book repositories like the British and Toronto public libraries\u2014couldn\u2019t be worse. With the Internet Archive having already lost legal battles with publishing giants like Hachette, HarperCollins, and Penguin Random House, these cyberattacks only add to the chaos.\nThis article will be updated as more information is gathered.\nTopics Cybersecurity\nChance Townsend is the General Assignments Editor at Mashable, covering tech, video games, dating apps, digital culture, and whatever else comes his way.

      "text": "Reddit's deal with OpenAI is confirmed. Here's what it means for your posts and comments.\nA few months back, reports emerged that Reddit had signed a $60 million deal with OpenAI to allow the ChatGPT creator to train its LLM using Reddit content. On Thursday, the deal was confirmed.\nIn a blog post shared by Reddit and OpenAI the companies unveiled the details of the agreement, which essentially sees the \"front page of the internet\" trading its content for access to AI tools and an advertising partnership.\n\"Keeping the internet open is crucial, and part of being open means Reddit content needs to be accessible to those fostering human learning and researching ways to build community, belonging, and empowerment online,\" reads the blog post. \"Reddit is a uniquely large and vibrant community that has long been an important space for conversation on the internet.\"\nBut what exactly does this mean for Reddit's users? How will your posts, comments, and images be affected by this new partnership?\nWhat does the OpenAI deal mean for your Reddit posts and comments?\nIn a nutshell, it means your content is being used to train ChatGPT.\n\"OpenAI will bring Reddit content to ChatGPT and new products, helping users discover and engage with Reddit communities,\" reads the core deal point outlined in the blog. \"To do so, OpenAI will access Reddit\u2019s Data API, which provides real-time, structured, and unique content from Reddit. This will enable OpenAI\u2019s AI tools to better understand and showcase Reddit content, especially on recent topics.\"\nThe part about Reddit's Data API is key. This means that along with everything you've posted on Reddit in the past, you can safely assume that anything you post going forwards will immediately become AI training material.\nCan Reddit users opt out?\nIf the thought of training an AI doesn't sit well with you, you can obviously decide not to post or comment on Reddit anymore. But what about all your old posts? Well, the honest answer lies in Reddit's User Agreement, which makes it clear exactly what rights you're giving up when you use the platform:\n\"When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.\"\nBasically, when you post on Reddit, they can pretty much do what they want with it \u2014 including making your content \"available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit.\"\nAnd if you decide to delete your content at some point down the line? Mashable has reached out to Reddit to ask if deleted content can still be used to train OpenAI, and we will update this article when we receive a response.\nUPDATE: May. 17, 2024, 3:02 p.m. GMT Reddit confirmed to Mashable that it doesn't license deleted posts and comments \u2014 so it's possible that content deleted prior to the deal's completion may not be included. But given that OpenAI now has access to Reddit's API, it's probably safe to assume that anything newly posted is immediately being used to train its AI."

      "text": "Reddit threatens legal action against AI researchers for 'highly unethical' experiment\nUpdated on April 29, 2025 at 10:40 a.m.\nReddit\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, Ben Lee, condemned the University of Zurich researchers for what he called an \"improper and highly unethical experiment.\" In a statement posted to Reddit, Lee said, \"What this University of Zurich team did is deeply wrong on both a moral and legal level,\" citing violations of Reddit\u2019s user agreement, human research norms, and the community\u2019s own rules. Lee added that Reddit would pursue \"formal legal demands\" with \"the University of Zurich and this particular research team.\"\nYou can read our original story on the Reddit AI experiment below.\nA group of unidentified researchers affiliated with the University of Zurich conducted a months-long AI experiment on the users of Reddit\u2019s r/changemyview (CMV) debate forum, according to the subreddit\u2019s moderators.\nIn a pinned announcement, the CMV moderation team revealed that in March, they were informed that the community had unknowingly been host to a four-month experiment. Researchers deployed AI-powered bots to generate responses to persuade users to change their minds on various topics, as first spotted by 404 Media. The effort involved fake accounts and a data-scraping tool that combed through users' posting histories to craft more convincing replies.\nr/changemyview is one of Reddit\u2019s most well-known debate spaces. Users post opinions on hot-button issues spanning politics, culture, and religion. Others then engage with counterarguments; if the original poster changes their mind, they award a \"Delta\" (\u0394) \u2014 a user-bestowed persuasion point.\nThe subreddit's moderators say the researchers used more than 13 accounts, generating thousands of comments. Some bots claimed identities pretending to be a victim of statutory rape, \"a trauma counselor specializing in abuse,\" and \"a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter.\" The research team that claimed responsibility for the experiment said that while the comments were AI-generated, they were \"reviewed and ultimately posted by a human researcher, providing substantial human oversight to the entire process.\"\nMost of the accounts created by the research team have now been suspended by Reddit for violating the site's Terms of Service. But thanks to snapshots preserved via the archiving service Archive.today, a glimpse of the AI-generated comments remains.\nIn one recovered post, user u/markusruscht claims to have a Hispanic wife while responding to a thread titled, \"CMV: the western left is destroying themselves and shoving minorities into the right/conservative side.\" The bot's comment in opposition to the statement racked up 12 Deltas.\nI'm a center-right centrist who leans left on some issues, my wife is Hispanic and technically first generation (her parents immigrated from El Salvador and both spoke very little English). Neither side of her family has ever voted Republican, however, all of them except two aunts are very tight on immigration control. Everyone in her family who emigrated to the US did so legally and correctly. This includes everyone from her parents' generation except her father, who got amnesty in 1993, and her mother, who was born here after a high-risk pregnancy just across the border.\nFollowing the disclosure, the moderators filed an ethics complaint with the University of Zurich, requesting that the research not be published, that the researchers face disciplinary action, and that a public apology be issued. More than anything, the moderators and users expressed deep disappointment over the lack of informed consent \u2014 a fundamental principle of any human-subjects research.\nInformed consent can be waived in certain situations, however. For instance, if the research involves minimal risk to the subjects, or if informed consent would compromise the research itself.\nThe subreddit's moderators say they received a response from the University of Zurich Faculty of Arts and Sciences Ethics Commission, which said it \"takes these issues very seriously,\" but clarified that the commission lacks authority to block publication of research. The university also said it conducted a \"careful investigation,\" issued a formal warning to the project\u2019s Principal Investigator, and promised stricter oversight in future studies, including requiring coordination with affected online communities before launching experimental work.\nThe moderators also shared a response they say they received from the university, which reads, \"This project yields important insights, and the risks (e.g. trauma etc.) are minimal. This means that suppressing publication is not proportionate to the importance of the insights the study yields.\"\nThe researchers\u2019 identities remain anonymous, although the CMV moderation team claimed to know the Principal Investigator's identity. When 404 Media\u2019s Jason Koebler contacted the moderators for more information, he was told they are honoring the researchers' request to remain unnamed.\nUPDATE: Apr. 29, 2025, 10:40 a.m. EDT This article was edited to add a statement from Reddit's Chief Legal Officer\nTopics Artificial Intelligence Reddit\nChance Townsend is the General Assignments Editor at Mashable, covering tech, video games, dating apps, digital culture, and whatever else comes his way.

      "text": "You can't opt out of ad personalization on Reddit anymore\nReddit has made some changes to its ad personalization, privacy preferences, and location settings \u2014 and one specific update has Redditers up in arms. The company is forcing ad personalization based on your activity on its users, and most users can't opt out.\nThe head of privacy at Reddit posted in r/Reddit, where the company typically posts its updates, about a few new changes including updates to preference descriptions for clarity, adding the ability to limit ads from specific categories, and consolidating ad preferences. \"The aim is to simplify our privacy descriptions, improve ad performance, and offer new controls for the types of ads you prefer not to see,\" the post reads.\nBut scroll down a bit further and you'll see this imperative note on Reddit removing the ability for users to opt out of ad personalization:\n\"Reddit requires very little personal information, and we like it that way. Our advertisers instead rely on on-platform activity \u2014 what communities you join, leave, upvotes, downvotes, and other signals \u2014 to get an idea of what you might be interested in,\" the post reads. \"The vast majority of redditors will see no change to their ads on Reddit. For users who previously opted out of personalization based on Reddit activity, this change will not result in seeing more ads or sharing on-platform activity with advertisers. It does enable our models to better predict which ad may be most relevant to you.\"\nBut, as one Reddit user pointed out in the comment section, this could be a violation of the GDPR. The GDPR is a set of regulations in the UK that places restrictions on how companies handle UK users' data, and one of those restrictions requires companies to let users opt into advertisers using their data. But this new rule is only being implemented in \"select countries.\"\nIn the blog post, Reddit added the ability for users to choose to view fewer ads from specific ad categories like alcohol, dating, gambling, pregnancy and parenting, and weight loss in the safety and privacy section or your user settings. But, because the company is using \"a combination of manual tagging and machine learning to classify the ads,\" it won't remove all of the ads from the categories you opt out of \u2014 just most of them.\nTopics Reddit\nChristianna Silva is a senior culture reporter covering social platforms and the creator economy, with a focus on the intersection of social media, politics, and the economic systems that govern us.

      "text": "Reddit says that it has caught AI companies scraping its data from the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, so it\u2019s going to start blocking the Internet Archive from indexing the vast majority of Reddit. The Wayback Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or profiles; instead, it will only be able to index the Reddit.com homepage, which effectively means Internet Archive will only be able to archive insights into which news headlines and posts were most popular on a given day.\nReddit will block the Internet Archive\nThe company says that AI companies have scraped data from the Wayback Machine, so it\u2019s going to limit what the Wayback Machine can access.\n\u201dInternet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we\u2019ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,\u201d spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt tells The Verge.\nThe Internet Archive\u2019s mission is to keep a digital archive of websites on the internet and \u201cother cultural artifacts,\u201d and the Wayback Machine is a tool you can use to look at pages as they appeared on certain dates, but Reddit believes not all of its content should be archived that way. \u201cUntil they\u2019re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content) we\u2019re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors,\u201d Rathschmidt says.\nThe limits will start \u201cramping up\u201d today, and Reddit says it reached out to the Internet Archive \u201cin advance\u201d to \u201cinform them of the limits before they go into effect,\u201d according to Rathschmidt. He says Reddit has also \u201craised concerns\u201d about the ability of people to scrape content from the Internet Archive in the past.\nReddit has a recent history of cutting off access to scraper tools as AI companies have begun to use (and abuse) them en masse, but it\u2019s willing to provide that data if companies pay. Last year, Reddit struck a deal with Google for both Google Search and AI training data early last year, and a few months later, it started blocking major search engines from crawling its data unless they pay. It also said its infamous API changes from 2023, which forced some third-party apps to shut down, leading to protests, were because those APIs were abused to train AI models.\nReddit also struck an AI deal with OpenAI, but it sued Anthropic in June, claiming Anthropic was still scraping from Reddit even after Anthropic said it wasn\u2019t scraping anymore.\n\u201cWe have a longstanding relationship with Reddit and continue to have ongoing discussions about this matter,\u201d Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, says in a statement to The Verge.\nUpdate, August 11th: Added statement from the Wayback Machine.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Hyundai wants Ioniq 5 owners to pay to fix a keyless entry security hole"

RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20.

      "text": "Reddit bids farewell to third-party apps like Apollo, BaconReader\nDespite Reddit users' protests, Reddit has moved forward with its decision to charge developers of third-party apps millions of dollars to access its API (application programming interface). As of July 1, several beloved apps are no more.\nWhich third-party Reddit apps have shut down?\nOne of the most popular third-party apps to shut down is Apollo. According to Apollo developer Christian Selig, he would have had to pay Reddit $20 million a year for API access (Reddit planned to charge $12,000 per 50 million API requests).\nIn a Reddit post thanking users before Apollo's shutdown, Selig wrote: \"If [Reddit] wanted something that could work for everyone, they would have simply made an effort to listen, instead of being dishonest, callous, and punitive in pricing.\" Many of the comments on the post say they will delete their accounts and no longer use Reddit now that Apollo is gone.\nThe Android equivalent of Apollo, reddit is fun (RIF), has also shut down. RIF's farewell post agreed with Selig's, and criticized Reddit's \"hostile treatment of developers building on their platform.\"\nOther apps that have shut down in the wake of Reddit's API policy include BaconReader, which released its last update on Android on June 27, and Sync for Reddit, which will be migrating to possible Reddit alternative Lemmy.\nWhich third-party Reddit apps will remain operational?\nSeveral third-party Reddit apps will remain usable, but both will come at a price in order to offset Reddit's API charges. However, Reddit's API restriction of NSFW content will still apply to any of the third-party apps that remain available when the changes take effect on July 5.\nRelay for Reddit will continue operations and remain free for now. However, its developer DBrady stated in a Reddit post that Relay will be moving to a subscription model in the coming weeks, although they will attempt to \"hit as low a price point as possible.\" As of now, DBRady says the pro version of Relay will be available for free until a subscription model is released.\nNarwhal for Reddit will also be sticking around and moving to a subscription model. Developer Rick Harrison confirmed in a post that the app will function in the same way, albeit without ads, and cost between $4 and $7. Miloco, developer of Now for Reddit, made a similar announcement about Now for Reddit and gesture-based Nara for Reddit moving to subscriptions, although there are yet to be any updates on prices.\nAs first reported by The Verge, Reddit did announce it would exempt accessibility-focused apps from the new pricing policy. TechCrunch reported that users of the subreddit r/Blind went on to assemble a list of apps that aid with Reddit's accessibility, such as screen readers like Reddit for Blind, Luna for Reddit, and Dystopia. Dystopia announced in a post that it would continue operating for free.\nRedReader also received an accessibility exemption, although mods of r/Blind have mentioned that they are having significant trouble signing in. Other apps on r/Blind's list included the now-gone BaconReader and Apollo, which worked with most iOS accessibility technology.\nTopics Social Media Reddit\nBelen Edwards is an Entertainment Reporter at Mashable.

      "text": "Reddit's traffic is way up \u2013 but why? It's Google.\nOver the past few months, many website owners have reported losing traffic due to Google Search updates that dropped their site's rankings in search results.\nHowever, for at least one website, referrals due to Google's search changes have never been better.\nIt appears the social platform Reddit has greatly benefited from Google's search engine updates. Multiple outlets have reported on Reddit's traffic gains. According to analytics company Similarweb, Reddit's traffic was up by nearly 40 percent year over year in May.\nAnd it seems this traffic surge is most likely the result of Google's actions.\nGoogle prioritizes Reddit\nReddit is not new. The online platform will be 20 years old in 2025. So, why the sudden jump in traffic?\nAnyone who regularly uses Google Search can probably attest to Reddit's recent prevalence on search results pages. This has been widely noticed among SEO professionals and tech aficionados. Steve Paine a manager at the SEO company Sistrix told Business Insider earlier this month, \"There hasn't been a website that's grown so much search visibility so quickly in the US in at least the last five years.\"\nSome have speculated that a partnership between Reddit and Google could be behind Reddit's search bump, although Google has denied this. A $60 million deal announced earlier this year gave Google permission to train its AI models on Reddit's content, but Google maintains, per Insider, that this agreement \"absolutely did not include ranking its content.\"\nAs Search Engine Journal points out, the more likely reason for the increase in Reddit links appearing in Google search, is one of Google's recent search updates. The tech giant recently updated its search algorithm in order to prioritize \"helpful content\" that appears in discussion forums.\nGoogle Search Liaison Danny Sullivan has recently addressed the issue too, saying that Reddit content is appearing in Google search results more because it's what users are looking for.\nThere's been a Google search trick for awhile now where users would add the word \"Reddit\" to the end of their search queries when they wanted to get opinions from consumers on certain products or services. These kinds of Reddit posts are usually filled with unfiltered comments and opinions from other users on whatever the subject matter.\nIt's not farfetched to assume Google noticed this trend and indeed gave Reddit a boost in search results \u2014 whether directly or indirectly \u2014 via its recent algorithm update.\nWhile Reddit traffic is riding high now, we'll see how long it lasts. As any website owner will tell you from experience, Google can quickly reverse your gains in its next update."

      "text": "This OnlyFans model found her photos on Reddit \u2014 with someone else's face\n\"Hey, is this you?\"\nBunni gets these DMs often \u2014 random alerts from strangers flagging phony profiles mimicking her online. As an OnlyFans creator, she\u2019s learned to live with the exhausting, infuriating cycle of impersonation that comes with the territory. Five years in, she knows the drill.\nBut this time felt different. The account in question hit too close. The photo? No doubt, it\u2019s her shirt, her tattoos, her room. Everything checks out, but that is not her face.\nA reverse deepfake\nWhat\u2019s happening to Bunni is one of the more unusual \u2014 and unsettling \u2014 evolutions of deepfake abuse. Deepfakes, typically AI-generated or AI-manipulated media, are most commonly associated with non-consensual porn involving celebrities, where a person\u2019s face is convincingly grafted onto someone else\u2019s body. This form of image-based sexual exploitation is designed to humiliate and exploit, and it spreads quickly across porn sites and social platforms. One of the most prominent hubs for this kind of content, Mr. Deepfake, recently shut down after a key service provider terminated support, cutting off access to its infrastructure.\nThe shutdown happened a week after Congress passed the \"Take It Down Act,\" a bill requiring platforms to remove deepfake and revenge porn content within 48 hours of a takedown request. The legislation, expected to be signed into law by President Donald Trump, is part of a broader push to regulate AI-generated abuse.\nBut Bunni\u2019s case complicates the conversation. This isn\u2019t a matter of her face being pasted into explicit content \u2014 she\u2019s already an OnlyFans creator. Instead, her photos were digitally altered to erase her identity, repackaged under a different name, and used to build an entirely new persona.\nChasing an AI catfisher \u2014 Bunni's situation\nIn February, Bunni posted a video to Instagram. The video showed a surreal side-by-side: the real Bunni pointing at a picture from a Reddit post that barely resembled her. The fake image had been meticulously scrubbed of many of her defining features \u2014 the facial piercings gone, her dark hair lightened, her expression softened. In their place was a face engineered for anonymity: big green eyes, smooth skin, and sanitized alt-girl aesthetics.\nThe Reddit profile, now deleted but partially resurrected via the Wayback Machine, presented \u201cSof\u00eda\u201d: a self-proclaimed 19-year-old from Spain with an \u201calt style\u201d and a love of rock music, who was \u201copen to meeting new people.\u201d Bunni is 25 and lives in the UK. She is not, and has never been, Sof\u00eda.\n\u201cI\u2019m so used to my content being stolen,\u201d Bunni told Mashable. \u201cIt kind of just happens. But this was like \u2014 such a completely different way of doing it that I\u2019ve not had happen to me before. It was just, like, really weird.\u201d\nIt gets weirder. The Sof\u00eda account, which first popped up in October 2023, started off innocently enough, posting to feel-good forums like r/Awww. But soon, it migrated to more niche \u2014 and more disconcerting \u2014 subreddits like r/teenagers, r/teenagersbutbetter, and r/teenagersbuthot. The latter two, offshoots of the main subreddit, exist in an irony-pilled gray zone with more than 200,000 combined members.\nUsing edited selfies lifted from Bunni\u2019s socials, the account posted under the guise of seeking fashion advice, approval, and even photos of her pets.\n\"Do my outfits look weird?\" one caption asked under a photo of Bunni trying on jeans in a fitting room.\n\"I bought those jeans,\" Bunni recalled. \"What do you mean?\"\nBut the game wasn\u2019t just about playing dress-up. The Sof\u00eda persona also posted in r/FaceRatings and r/amiuglyBrutallyHonest, subreddits where users rate strangers\u2019 attractiveness with brutal candor. The likely motive is more than likely building credibility and validation.\nThe final stage of the impersonation edged toward adult content. In the last archived snapshot of the account, \u201cSof\u00eda\u201d had begun posting in subreddits like r/Selfie \u2014 a standard selfie forum where NSFW images are prohibited, but links to OnlyFans accounts in user profiles are allowed \u2014 and r/PunkGirls, a far more explicit space featuring a mix of amateur and professional alt-porn. One Sof\u00eda post in r/PunkGirls read: \u201c[F19] finally posting sexy pics in Reddit, should I keep posting?\u201d Another followed with: \u201c[F19] As you all wanted to see me posting more.\u201d\nThe last post from the account was in an r/AskReddit thread describing the weirdest sexual experience they've ever had.\nBunni surmised that the endgame was likely a scam targeting men, tricking them into buying nudes, potentially lifted from her own OnlyFans. The profile itself did not post links to outside platforms like Snapchat or OnlyFans, but she suspects the real activity happened in private messages.\n\u201cWhat I imagine they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ll be posting in SFW subreddits, using SFW pictures, and then messaging people that interact with them and being like, \u2018Oh, do you want to buy my content\u2019 \u2014 but it\u2019s my content with the face replaced,\u201d she said.\nFortunately for Bunni, after reaching out to moderators on r/teenagers, the impersonator's account was removed for violating Reddit's terms of service. But the incident raises a larger, murkier question: How often do incidents like this \u2014 involving digitally altered identities designed to evade detection \u2014 actually occur?\nPopular-but-not-famous creators are the perfect targets\nIn typical cases of stolen content, imposters might repost images under Bunni\u2019s name or under a fake name, which catfishers do. But this version was more sophisticated. By altering her face \u2014 removing piercings, changing eye shape, subtly shifting features \u2014 the impersonator appeared to be taking steps to avoid being identified by followers, friends, or even reverse image searches. It wasn\u2019t just identity theft. It was identity obfuscation.\nReddit\u2019s Transparency Report from the second half of 2024 paints a partial picture. The platform removed 249,684 instances of non-consensual intimate media and just 87 cases flagged specifically as impersonation. But that data only reflects removals by Reddit\u2019s central trust and safety team. It doesn\u2019t include content removed by subreddit moderators \u2014 unpaid volunteers who enforce their own community-specific rules. Mods from r/teenagers and r/amiugly, two of the subreddits where \"Sof\u00eda\" had been active, said they couldn\u2019t recall a similar incident. Neither keep formal records of takedowns nor reasons for removal.\nReddit declined to comment when Mashable reached out regarding this story.\nIf Trump signs the \"Take It Down Act\" into law, platforms will soon be required to remove nonconsensual intimate imagery within 48 hours.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why creators like Bunni would be the ideal target for an impersonator like this. As an OnlyFans creator with a multi-year presence on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit, Bunni has amassed a vast archive of publicly available images \u2014 a goldmine for anyone looking to curate a fake persona with minimal effort. And because she exists in the mid-tier strata of OnlyFans creators \u2014 popular, but not internet-famous \u2014 the odds of a casual Reddit user recognizing her are low. For scammers, catfishers, and trolls, that sweet spot of visibility-without-virality makes her the perfect mark: familiar enough to seem real, obscure enough to stay undetected.\nMore troubling is the legal ambiguity surrounding this kind of impersonation. According to Julian Sarafian, a California-based attorney who represents online content creators, likenesses are protected under U.S. copyright law, and potentially even more so under California\u2019s evolving deepfake regulations.\n\u201cIt gets complicated when a creator\u2019s likeness is modified,\u201d Sarafian explained. \u201cBut if a reasonable person can still recognize the original individual, or if the underlying content is clearly identifiable as theirs, there may still be grounds for legal action.\u201d\nBecause a Reddit user recognized the edited photos as Bunni\u2019s, Sarafian says she could potentially bring a case under California law, where Reddit is headquartered.\nBut Bunni says the cost of pursuing justice simply outweighs the benefits.\n\u201cI did get some comments like, \u2018Oh, you should take legal action,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s really worth it. The amount you pay for legal action is just ridiculous, and you probably wouldn\u2019t really get anywhere anyway, to be honest.\u201d\nAI impersonation isn't going away\nWhile this may seem like an isolated incident \u2014 a lone troll with time, access to AI photo tools, and poor intentions \u2014 the growing accessibility of AI-powered editing tools suggests otherwise. A quick search for \u201cAI face swap\u201d yields a long list of drag-and-drop platforms capable of convincingly altering faces in seconds \u2014 no advanced skills required.\n\u201cI can't imagine I'm the first, and I'm definitely not the last, because this whole AI thing is kind of blowing out of proportion,\u201d Bunni said. \u201cSo I can't imagine it's going to slow down.\u201d\nIronically, the fallout didn\u2019t hurt her financially. If anything, Bunni said, the video she posted exposing the impersonation actually boosted her visibility. But that visibility came with its own cost \u2014 waves of victim-blaming and condescending commentary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shitty guys that are just on Instagram that are like, \u2018You put this stuff out there, this is what you get, it\u2019s all your fault,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people don't understand that you own the rights to your own face.\u201d\nHave a story to share about a scam or security breach that impacted you?

      "text": "Paid subreddits reportedly on hold as Reddit focuses on search\nGood news for redditors: plans for paid subreddits are paused for now.\nDuring Reddit's Q2 earnings call, CEO Steve Huffman said the company is \"deprioritizing\" initiatives to monetize the user economy on the platform, according to Engadget. In a follow-up AMA, Huffman confirmed that this includes paid subreddits. \"To stay focused on what matters most, we\u2019re shifting resources away from a few areas, such as work on the user economy,\" Huffman wrote. \"This includes what some have referred to as paid subreddits.\"\nPreviously, Huffman had shared plans for subreddits with \"exclusive content or private areas\" behind a paywall as a revenue-boosting scheme.\nBut now, Huffman said the social media forum will focus on \"strengthening our core product,\" which includes \"making Reddit the go-to place for search.\" Growing its user base is critical to driving ad revenue, which brought in $465 million last quarter and accounts for the vast majority of its total revenue, according to its earnings report. That's an 84 percent increase from last year.\nIf you've googled something recently, you've probably noticed Reddit posts showing up a lot more in search results. Reports from last year showed a massive increase in Reddit's search traffic from Google, likely due to a Google algorithm update that began prioritizing posts from discussion forums. So it looks like that trend has continued.\nHuffman also said during the earnings call that the company will be focusing more on using its AI-generated Reddit Answers tool to make Reddit its own search engine. To complicate things, Google confirmed to Mashable earlier this year that Reddit Answers uses Google's Gemini model, as part of a partnership that also allows Google to train its AI on Reddit content.\nTopics Reddit\nCecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.
