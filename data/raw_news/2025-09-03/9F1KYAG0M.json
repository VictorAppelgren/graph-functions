  "description": "Lotteries are statistically proven to lose money. The stock market is statistically proven to make money.",
  "content": "\u2022 Counterpoint: Powerball players will probably lose close to $700 million, collectively, by playing.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nAt an estimated jackpot value of $1.4 million, the Powerball lottery drawing to be held tonight is drawing plenty of attention. And it reminded me of a lottery research report The Motley Fool published back in May.\n\nSpecifically, it reminded me how very bad the odds are of winning a lottery, and how very quickly -- mathematically speaking -- you can lose a lot of money buying lottery tickets. (Statistically, you really are a lot better off investing in the stock market than buying lottery tickets.)\n\nHere's how the math works. Focusing on lotteries conducted in 2023, The Motley Fool's research shows that Americans spent $103 billion on lottery tickets that year. But only $69 billion of that money came back to the ticket buyers in the form of prizes.\n\nAlready, this suggests that for every $1 you spend on a lottery ticket, you can expect to get back less than $0.67 in winnings. But wait -- it gets worse.\n\n\"Jackpot\" numbers aren't necessarily all they're cracked up to be, because payouts are made over 30 years (or paid in an immediate, but much smaller lump sum), such that the present-day value of the award is much smaller than the headline figure.\n\nIn the case of the current Powerball jackpot, for example, Powerball's own website explains that the immediate cash value of the current $1.4 billion jackpot is just $634 million -- just 45% of what players probably think they'll be getting if they win!\n\nResult: Pay $1 today, and on average, you can expect to get back just $0.30 of your \"investment.\"\n\nHow does this work in practice? Say you start with $1,000, and spend it all on lottery tickets in a single day. You can expect to \"win\" back $300 of your starting $1,000. Do this again on a second day, and you'll have just $90 left to spend on lottery tickets on Day 3, $27 on Day 4, $8.10 on Day 5, $2.40 on Day 6, and by Day 7, you'll have just $0.73 remaining.\n\nToo little money to afford to buy even one lottery ticket.\n\nPowerball notes that the odds of winning the grand prize are 1 in 292 million.\n\nA better play for your money\n\nThe math is incontrovertible. Statistically speaking, you're guaranteed to lose money playing the lottery over any length of time. But the opposite seems true for investing in the stock market.\n\nIn fact, over the last 97 years, investors in the S&P 500 have enjoyed an average profit of 10% per year. That's an average. Some years show gains; some show losses.",

      "text": "Despite the appearance of a few bear markets, the past decade has still been great for stocks. From 2012 through 2021, the average stock market return was 14.8% annually for the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC), despite the infamous 33-day bear market of 2020.\nEven though another bear market emerged in January 2022 and ended in October 2022 (when the S&P 500 hit its low point for the year), looking over the past decade from 2014-24 you still get an average stock market return of 13.45% annually. That's a total return of more than 250% in the trailing-10-year period.\nThe returns can -- and do -- vary wildly from one year to the next, and an \"average\" year almost never actually generates the average return. The catch? Nobody knows which years will be above or below average. This is where the one-year average is helpful only in setting the stage for stocks as good long-term investments.\nAverage returns\nAverage stock market returns\nIn general, when people say \"the stock market,\" they mean the S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 is a collection -- referred to as a stock market index -- of just more than 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies. (The list is updated every quarter with major changes annually.) While there are thousands more stocks trading on U.S. stock exchanges, the S&P 500 comprises about 80% of the entire stock market value on its own, making it a useful proxy for the performance of the stock market as a whole.\nReturns\nThe market's results from one year to the next can vary significantly from the average. Let's use the 2012-21 period as an example:\n- Down 4.4%: 1 year.\n- Up 2% or less: 1 year.\n- Up more than 20%: 4 years.\n- Up between 12% and 19%: 4 years.\nTo put it another way, six of those 10 years resulted in outcomes that were very different from the 14.8% annualized average return during that decade. Of those six very different years, two generated significantly lower returns (with one year, 2018, resulting in losses), while four years delivered substantially higher returns. Two of those years -- 2013 and 2019 -- generated returns of more than 30%, helping to make up for the years that saw below-average returns.\n10, 30, & 50-year returns\n10-year, 30-year, and 50-year average stock market returns\nLet's take a look at the stock market's average annualized returns (adjusting for inflation) over the following 10, 30, and 50-year time frames, using the S&P 500 as our proxy for the market.\n| Period | Average Return (Including dividends) | Annualized Return (Adjusted for inflation) | $1 Becomes... (Adjusted for inflation) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 10 years (2013-23) | 12% | 10.83% | $3.10 |\n| 30 years (1993-2023) | 9.03% | 7.46% | $9.30 |\n| 50 years (1973-2023) | 10.02% | 7.68% | $23.99 |\nIt's worth highlighting the variance in annual returns from one year to the next vs. the average. Since 1972, here is a breakdown of the yearly results:\n- Returns of 20% or more: 19 years.\n- Returns between 10% and 20%: 13 years.\n- Returns between 0% and 10%: nine years.\n- Losses between 0% and 10%: four years.\n- Losses between 10% and 20%: two years.\n- Losses of more than 20%: three years.\nReturns vs. inflation\nStock market returns vs. inflation\nIn addition to showing the average returns, the table above also shows useful information on stock returns adjusted for inflation. For example, let's say you invested $100 in the S&P 500 at the beginning of 1973.\nYou would have about $18,940.81 at the end of 2024 if you reinvested all dividends -- a return on investment of 18,840.81%, or 10.74% per year.\nNow, if you're looking at an inflation-adjusted return, that's approximately 2,567.20% cumulatively, or 6.59% per year.\nRelated investing topics\nBuy-and-hold investing\nBuy-and-hold investing\nIf there's any one lesson we can take from the breakdown of annual results vs. the average, it's that investors are far more likely to earn the best returns by investing for the long term. There's simply no reliably accurate way to predict which years will be the good years and which years will underperform or even lead to losses.\nBut we do know that, historically, the stock market has gone up more years than it has gone down. The S&P 500 has gained value in approximately 40 of the past 50 years, generating an average annualized return of 9.4%. Despite that, only a handful of years actually came within a few percentage points of the actual average. For far more years, it significantly either underperformed or outperformed the average than were close to the average.\nWhat's a person to do? Buy high-quality stocks, ideally regularly across every market condition, and hold those investments for many years. The evidence is overwhelming that investors who try to trade their way to higher returns with short-term moves or who buy and sell based on projections of short-term peaks and bottoms generally earn below-average returns. Moreover, those strategies require substantially more time and effort. They can also result in higher fees and taxes that further reduce gains.\nIf you're looking to build wealth, investing in stocks is an excellent place to start. But to get the best returns in stock investing, use the method that's tried and true: Buy great stocks and hold them for as long as possible."

      "text": "Lottery Statistics and Revenue by State\nKEY POINTS\n- Total lottery spending: Americans spent approximately $103 billion on lottery tickets in 2023.\n- Lottery spending per capita: Americans in states where the lottery is offered spent $321 per capita in 2023 on lottery tickets.\n- Lottery spending by state: Massachusetts residents spent $867 per capita in 2023 on lottery tickets, more than $300 more than any other state. North Dakota residents spent the least amount per capita that year among states that have a lottery, just $48.\nWith jackpots exceeding $1 billion, playing the lottery can seem like an enticing potential shortcut to never again being financially burdened. Unfortunately, the odds of winning billions are remote -- 1 in 292 million for the Powerball jackpot -- and players are more likely to lose their cash than win even small prizes.\nThose odds haven't stopped Americans from trying their luck, however. Americans shelled out $103 billion on state lottery tickets in 2023. That earned a prize payout of $69 billion, but that's not evenly distributed among the millions of bettors estimated to play the lottery each year.\nInstead of buying lottery tickets in hopes of securing a huge windfall, it's possible to channel that money into products and assets that can increase in value without needing any luck. The best high-yield savings accounts offer competitive interest rates that will grow account balances without needing to gamble, for example. Investing through the best brokers offers more upside than savings accounts, albeit with risks.\nMotley Fool Money has broken down lottery revenue by state, prize payouts and losses per capita in each state, lottery winner statistics, and other lottery facts.\nLottery income by state and per capita\nAmericans spent $103 billion on lottery tickets in 2023, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nThat comes out to $321 spent on lottery tickets per capita that year among those living in states that offer the lottery. In reality, a small minority of Americans who are consistent players make up the majority of lottery ticket spending. The most recent polling data shows that roughly 50% of Americans buy a lottery ticket at least once a year and the majority of those only play rarely, when jackpots are enormous.\nCalifornia brought in the most lottery sales in 2023, roughly $9.2 billion. Florida also raked in $9.2 billion, while New York counted $8.8 billion. Texas was the only other state with lottery income above $8 billion, making $9 billion.\nMassachusetts, despite its relatively small population, had the fifth-highest lottery revenue: $6.1 billion. Massachusetts Lottery Executive Director Mark William Bracken has suggested that one reason the Bay State may punch above its weight, in terms of lottery sales, is due to residents of neighboring states hopping across the border into Massachusetts to take advantage of bigger payouts for the same prices they would pay in their home state.\nMassachusetts residents also have among the highest median household incomes in the country, which means they may have more disposable income to spend on lottery tickets.\nLottery prize winnings and losses per capita by state\nMassachusetts residents earn $635 in lottery winnings per capita, more than $200 more than any other state. In practice, those winnings are not spread equally among bettors, but are taken home by the sliver of lottery players who are lucky enough to win big.\nMassachusetts also has the fourth-highest loss on lottery tickets per capita, $244. The state where residents lose the most is Rhode Island, with a lottery loss per capita of $362.\nIn no state does prizes paid out exceed lottery spending. Virginia has the highest prizes paid per dollar spent per capita, at $0.78.\nHere's a full breakdown of the lottery payout per state per capita. Note that this is not the same as the average lottery winnings per winner.\nLottery income and revenue over time\nStates took in a record $103 billion in lottery sales, paid out $69 billion in prizes, and had $30 billion in proceeds available, in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Those are all record highs.\nLottery sales jumped $15.4 billion from 2020 to 2021, the largest increase recorded. Prizes grew by $10.8 billion and income available for states to spend increased by $3.4 billion. Despite that, states have struggled to grow the percent of sales they have available to spend.\nHow much do states earn from lottery sales?\nIn 2023, lottery proceeds -- revenue from lottery sales minus prizes paid and administrative costs associated with running the lottery -- accounted for 2.1% of total state taxes collected among the 45 states that run lotteries.\nLottery proceeds accounted for more than 7% of state tax revenue in Rhode Island, West Virginia, and South Dakota. On the other end of the spectrum, money from the lottery made up just 0.2% of North Dakota's tax revenue in 2023.\nOn average, lottery proceeds make up 2.3% of state revenue.\nIs playing the lottery worth it?\nPlaying the lottery may appear to be a quick way to get rich, but it's not a wise investment given that the odds of winning the jackpot are usually one in hundreds of millions. Even if you're feeling lucky, it's extremely unlikely you'll win.\nNot only can the financial costs of playing the lottery add up, it can also take an emotional and psychological toll. On the other hand, money in a high-yield savings account is secured and protected, and other products like CDs and bonds are either no-risk or relatively low-risk, low-worry options to grow wealth. Investing can offer more upside with higher risk than those products.\nFAQs\n-\nThe odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292 million. More specifically, 1 in 292,201,338, according to Powerball.\nExperts say it's more likely to be struck by lightning once than to win the Powerball, even if you played every drawing during a lifetime.\n-\nAbout 50% of American adults buy a lottery ticket each year, according to experts and a Gallup poll most recently conducted in 2016. Based on that survey, about 162 million people would have bought lottery tickets that year.\nAcademics say that most people who buy lottery tickets do so only when jackpots are enormous. Most spending on lottery tickets is done by 20% to 30% of players that regularly buy tickets. Only a fraction of that percentage actually win.\n-\nThese are the five largest lottery jackpots won:\n- $2.04 billion, Powerball, Nov. 8, 2022.\n- $1.765 billion, Powerball, Oct. 12, 2023\n- $1.586 billion, Powerball, Jan. 13, 2016.\n- $1.58 billion, Mega Millions, Aug. 8, 2023.\n- $1.537 billion, Mega Millions, Oct. 23, 2018.\n-\nLottery winnings are taxed by the IRS and most states as income, which means big winners are placed in the highest tax brackets. Non-monetary prizes, like a car or house, are taxed as income at fair market value.\n-\nForty-five states operate lotteries. The five states that don't run lotteries are Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah.\n-\nSources\n- Gallup (2016). \"About Half of Americans Play State Lotteries.\"\n- National Public Radio (2023). \"Here's who really wins and loses in American lotteries.\"\n- New York Times (2024). \"Here Are the 10 Biggest U.S. Lottery Jackpots Ever.\"\n- Powerball (2025). \"Powerball prize chart.\"\n- U.S. Census Bureau (2025). \"2023 Annual Survey of State Government Finances Tables: Income and Apportionment of State-Administered Lottery Funds: 2023.\"\n- U.S. Census Bureau (2025). \"State Government Tax Tables.\"\nOur Research Expert"
