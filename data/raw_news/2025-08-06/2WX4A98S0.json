  "description": "A MISSING woman was found dead with her clothes \u201cripped off\u201d in a man\u2019s shed, a court has heard. The body of Mariann Borocz, 55, was found by cops behind the home of suspect Christopher Barlo\u2026",
  "content": "The trial opened at Manchester Crown Court this week\n\nMURDER PROBE Missing woman found dead with her \u2018clothes ripped off\u2019 in man\u2019s shed, court hears\n\nA MISSING woman was found dead with her clothes \u201cripped off\u201d in a man's shed, a court has heard.\n\nThe body of Mariann Borocz, 55, was found by cops behind the home of suspect Christopher Barlow on Pedder Street, Manchester on Christmas Eve last year.\n\nThe trial opened at Manchester Crown Court this week.\n\nThe court heart that Mariann was seen on CCTV at a convenience store nearby just days before her body was discovered.\n\nBarlow, 60, was seen next to the victim in the store and appeared to buy cans of cider.\n\nProsecutor James Bourne-Arton KC said: \u201cThis is the last time she is seen alive.\n\n\u201cThe next time she was seen by someone other than the defendant was on December 21 when she was found dead in the defendant\u2019s shed.\n\n\u201cHer body was naked, her clothes had been cut or ripped off and placed in a nearby bin.\u201d\n\nBarlow, who wore a plain grey top, grey trousers and glasses in the dock, confirmed that he was the man seen in the footage.\n\nThe prosecutor continued: \u201cHe said she had asked him for \u00a31, and he had given her \u00a310.\n\n\u201cHe said that she had then walked off and not come down Pedder Street.\n\n\u201cA quick search of the property was carried out and during this search the defendant said he did not own a mobile phone and did not have access to the shed in his back yard, which he says he never uses.\u201d\n\nCops then combed through Barlow's property, where they made the grim discovery.\n\nMr Bourne-Arton added: \u201cA key to the padlock on the shed was found on the key ring in the possession of the defendant.\n\n\u201cIn the shed the deceased\u2019s body was found, the body was naked, and she was obviously dead.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said that \u201cother than a red mark on her neck there were no obvious signs of injury\u201d and that at this point Barlow was rearrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nHe said Ms Borocz\u2019s clothes \u201cwhich appear to have been ripped off\u201d were found in a nearby bin, along with her phone and handbag containing her passport and bank card.\n\nElsewhere in the house a sock was found on an ironing board that was found to contain Ms Borocz\u2019s DNA, while police also found a pair of scissors and a knife in the main bedroom.\n\nMr Bourne-Arton highlighted three possible causes of Mariann's death - asphyxia, hypothermia or deprivation of food and water.\n\nBut Mr Bourne-Arton said: \u201cWe do not think it is likely that she was locked in that shed alive, given the surrounding circumstances.\u201d\n\nBarlow denies murder and the lesser charge of manslaughter.",
