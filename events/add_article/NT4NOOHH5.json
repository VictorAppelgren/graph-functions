      "summary": "The dollar held steady as bond markets rallied, buoyed by a run‑up in long‑term yields that eased fiscal concerns. U.S. jobless claims rose above expectations, foreshadowing the upcoming non‑farm payrolls that could reinforce the case for a Fed rate cut. Investors remain cautious ahead of the September Fed meeting, with the dollar index largely unchanged at 98.207. The market is awaiting the payroll data to confirm whether rate cuts will materialize, potentially prompting a rebound in dollar demand.",
