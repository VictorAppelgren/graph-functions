  "title": "Snub the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE this Labor Day \u2013 the much better Watch7 is just as cheap at Best Buy",
  "description": "The Samsung Galaxy Watch7 is down to just $199 at Best Buy",
  "content": "Samsung Galaxy Watches are very popular during sales events, and for good reason: they're great smartwatches. As TechRadar's resident wearables editor, I've worn enough smartwatches to know a good one from a bad one, and Samsung models are great.\n\nFor Labor Day, you can get a 40mm Samsung Galaxy Watch7 (Bluetooth-only) from $199.99 at Best Buy, down from . That's the same price as the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE, which is packing far older parts and is generally inferior in every way.\n\nThat $50 discount applies to every Watch7 at Best Buy: the larger 44mm Bluetooth-only model is down from to just $229.99, while LTE-enabled versions of both watches, which can be added to a data plan, are also discounted by $50. This brings the 40mm LTE enabled Samsung Galaxy Watch7 down from to just $249.99 at Best Buy, while the 44mm model is reduced from to just $279.99\n\nWe've highlighted all four deals in full below, and you can check out our Labor Day sales hub for deals on everything from cameras to coffee makers.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch7 is a terrific watch (we gave it four stars in our review), but of course, it's last year's model.\n\nHowever, it'll be updated with the latest software for a long time to come, allowing you to enjoy the latest features on your watch even though it's not the very latest hardware \u2013 and these discounts make it a real bargain!\n\nAll of today's best Labor Day deals\n\u2022 Appliances: 50% off at Best Buy\n\u2022 DreamCloud: up to 60% off mattresses + free accessories\n\u2022 Nectar: mattress deals from $349, up to 50% off\n\u2022 Samsung: up to $1,500 off major appliances",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nSamsung's Galaxy Watch 7 doesn't really stray from its predecessor's sleek, circular build, but boosts the overall performance and expands on its already robust health and activity features. It's not a night-and-day difference over the previous generation, but still an excellent feature set for the price.\nPros\n- +\nA sleek, circular design with no visible bezel\n- +\nNew AI-powered wellness features provide more context\n- +\nFast performance from a new Exynos chip\nCons\n- -\nClassic model with a rotating bezel is missing\n- -\nNo improvement to battery life this time around\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: One-Minute Review\nUnlike Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch Ultra and the brand\u2019s Galaxy Ring, the Galaxy Watch 7 is more familiar. In a world of exciting designs, Samsung is sticking with a working formula that\u2019s been here on some of the best smartwatches like the Galaxy Watch 5 and 2024\u2019s Galaxy Watch 6 \u2013 but that\u2019s not a bad thing. Similar to Apple\u2019s approach with a standard Series 9 and an Ultra, the Galaxy Watch 7 is a refreshing bit of familiarity with some minor changes.\nThanks to Samsung\u2019s first 3-nanometer Exynos chip under the hood, much of the experience truly zips here \u2013 applications, be they Spotify, Messages, or Workout, open quickly, and processes wrap up pretty fast. This also powers some Galaxy AI features, but you do need a Galaxy smartphone to use them; and that includes the new Energy Score feature, which reminds me a lot of the Oura Ring. It's a welcome addition to the already highly-accurate health and activity experience the Galaxy Watch has long offered, especially for workout and sleep tracking.\nI also really like the new gestures, which speed up the one-handed use of the Galaxy Watch, but that also means it's an iterative refresh for this year's model, a trend that Samsung has been continuing for several generations.\nSuffice it to say the Galaxy Watch 7 is one of the best WearOS smartwatches around, especially if you have a Galaxy phone. Compared to the Ultra, it's the one for everyone. Just know, you don't need to rush out and grab one if you have a Watch 5 or a Watch 6.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: Specs\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (40mm) | Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (44mm) |\n| Chipset | Samsung Exynos W1000 with 2GB of RAM | Samsung Exynos W1000 with 2GB of RAM |\n| Software | WearOS 5 with Samsung One UI 6 | WearOS 5 with Samsung One UI 6 |\n| Dimensions | 40.4mm x 40.4mm x 9.7mm | 44.4mm x 44.4mm x 9.7mm |\n| Weight | 28.8g | 33.8g |\n| Display | 1.3-inch Super AMOLED Always-On display | 1.4-inch Super AMOLED Always-On display |\n| Case/Bezel | Armor Aluminum | Armor Aluminum |\n| GPS | GPS L1+L5, Glonass, Beidou, Galileo | GPS L1+L5, Glonass, Beidou, Galileo |\n| Battery | 300mAh | 425mAh |\n| Connectivity | Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi with optional LTE | Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi with optional LTE |\n| Durability | 5ATM + IP68 / MIL-STD-810H | 5ATM + IP68 / MIL-STD-810H |\n| Price | $299.99 / \u00a3289 / AU$549 (starting) | $329.99/ \u00a3319 / AU$599 (starting) |\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: price and availability\nUnlike the folding phones the Watch 7 launched alongside, the latest Galaxy Watch doesn\u2019t have a heftier price tag than its predecessor.\nThe Galaxy Watch 7 starts at $299.99 / \u00a3289 / AU$549 for the 40mm or $329.99/ \u00a3319 / AU$599 for the 44mm with standard Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. If you\u2019d like 4G LTE connectivity, the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 jumps to $349 / \u00a3339 / AU$649 and the 44mm model to $379 / \u00a3369 / AU$699.\nThe 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 is available in Green or Cream, while the larger 44mm model comes in Green or Silver. Both support a broad range of fabrics and can be custom-ordered to arrive with a fabric, sport, or athleisure band in varying colors.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJust like the Galaxy Watch Ultra or Z Flip 6, Samsung is offering some competitive trade-in bonuses to make the Galaxy Watch 7 very affordable.\n- Value score: 4/5\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: Design\n- Almost all screen\n- Gorgeous AMOLED brightness\n- New BioActive Sensor\nAt first glance, you might confuse the Galaxy Watch 7 with the Galaxy Watch 6. And that\u2019s not a knock on Samsung\u2019s design chops. The Galaxy Watch, with its sleek circular design, still looks fantastic; it\u2019s just more of an iterative change when it comes to design.\nI\u2019ve been testing the 41mm Galaxy Watch 7 in Green. It\u2019s basically all screen on the front, with smooth stainless steel sides, and thanks to its Super AMOLED screen, the display here gets plenty bright enough and text is easy to read. It can also be left in an always-on mode, but that will limit the battery life \u2013 more on that below.\nYou\u2019ll largely control the interface via the touchscreen with swipes or taps, but there are two physical buttons on the right-hand side. The top one takes you home, as always, and a long press on the bottom will pull up the Samsung Wallet.\nCompared to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch Ultra, a Garmin running watch, or an Apple Watch Ultra 2, the Galaxy Watch 7 feels a lot more manageable on the wrist and is a good bit lighter. I\u2019ve grown accustomed to the smaller 41mm size here as well, which is more in line with the Pixel Watch 2. I\u2019ll also note that the Galaxy Watch 7 still distinctly feels like its own thing; yes, it\u2019s a circular smartwatch like the Pixel Watch 2, but it doesn\u2019t stray all that much into the territory of other wearables.\nRegarding minimal physical changes, the Galaxy Watch 7 uses the same attaching and detaching band mechanism that Samsung ushered in with the Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic; it\u2019s as easy as pushing in on a tab and pulling the band out to swap them. There are a few new band designs, some of which look very similar to Apple\u2019s lineup, but Samsung has added two pops of color sewn in near the top of the watch bands for the Galaxy Watch 7 \u2013 it\u2019s a simple touch that adds a bit of personality.\nSamsung\u2019s new BioActive Sensor lives on the back and still delivers accurate metrics in line with other wearables. Visibly, compared to previous Galaxy Watches, there are more LEDs and sensors on the back to get a clear reading. You\u2019ll also still charge the Galaxy Watch 7 with Samsung\u2019s proprietary charger which magnetically attaches to the back.\nSo, while the design isn\u2019t a striking departure from the Galaxy Watch 6, I still really like the overall look and feel of a Galaxy Watch. It\u2019s sharp-looking and modern, all in a circular build that reminds me of a physical timepiece. I wish Samsung had given us one other option in 2024, though \u2013 the Galaxy Watch 7 Classic, with a moveable, rotating bezel. Sadly, folks who want that must get the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.\n- Design score: 4 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: Features\n- Tons of workout profiles\n- New hands-free gestures\n- New Energy Score tells you how tired (or not) you are\nNearly all of the changes live under the hood with the Galaxy Watch 7, so let\u2019s start with Samsung\u2019s first 3-nanometer chip in a smartwatch. It\u2019s a new Exynos processor that does feel downright snappy and makes WearOS 5 with Samsung\u2019s One UI 6 on top. While applications do open promptly, you can start a workout without hitting a snag, and measurements are prompt; the chip itself does a lot of heavy lifting in regards to health features in tandem with the BioActive Sensor on the back.\nOut of the box, the Galaxy Watch 7 can track hundreds of workouts, and you can create custom ones as well. This generation it can also let you compete with yourself if the historical data is there. In my weeks of testing, I ran through several rides on a Peloton indoor cycle with it, yoga, strength, and some walks around NJ and NYC.\nLike previous Galaxy Watches, the Watch 7 can easily take a heart-rate measurement, perform an electrocardiogram, and alert if it detects irregular rhythms. What\u2019s new with the Galaxy Watch 7 is tracking AGEs, or advanced glycation end products, which indicate overall metabolic health. Additionally, it\u2019s certified for sleep apnea detection out of the box by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This, in tandem with already excellent sleep tracking, will take a few weeks to acclimate but should deliver a solid experience.\nSamsung has already done a good job of making data actionable, but if you pair the Galaxy Watch 7 with a Galaxy smartphone, you\u2019ll get two other headlining features that work together well. An Energy Score looks at your data, from steps to calories burned with workouts and sleep, to sum up how you\u2019re doing daily, and Wellness Tips works with it to provide suggestions.\nMaybe it\u2019s taking it easier or trying to fit in another workout. It also pulls from pretty great data courtesy of the BioActive Sensors and Samsung\u2019s proprietary formulas and algorithms. Even so, and similar to Oura, the Energy Score here depends on how much you put into it and if you find the data relatable.\nThe new Double Pinch gesture has proven very handy for stopping timers, quickly silencing or taking a call, or even triggering a camera. It\u2019s basically a carbon copy of the experience on the Apple Watch, but that\u2019s not a bad thing, and I think folks will genuinely find it useful if one of their hands is full.\n- Features score: 4.5 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: Performance\n- Excellent speed\n- Intelligent AI health features\n- Battery life could be better\nThe Galaxy Watch 7 has performed great in my time with it \u2013 I\u2019ve worn it regularly and daily since getting it right after Galaxy Unpacked, and it\u2019s been paired with a Galaxy S24 Ultra.\nAnd I really wouldn\u2019t recommend diving into this Galaxy Watch if you don\u2019t have a Samsung smartphone \u2013 like years past, the experience is really designed to be used together, and some features, including the new AI health features, require it. Not to mention, Samsung Health is deeply integrated on both devices.\nThe entire experience is really prompt here, as I noted above, especially when it comes to using the Galaxy Watch 7 day in and day out. I can jump between apps, swipe to quickly jump into a tile to see my Energy Score or how I\u2019m doing with daily goals, scroll through messages, or even control playback within Spotify. Remember that since it\u2019s a WearOS watch with a Samsung skin, you\u2019ll find that the latter apps all have equivalents here, but you can also get anything from the Play Store.\nWith the new BioActive Sensor, I\u2019m finding that heart rate measurements and general data from workouts are pretty much on par with competing smartwatches, including the Pixel Watch 2 or the Apple Watch Ultra 2. What\u2019s a bit different is the level of detail Samsung provides and explanations for each statistic; it\u2019s basically on par with the Galaxy Watch 6 from 2023.\nSadly, battery life is also the same in that if you plan to wear the Galaxy Watch 7 during the day and want to use sleep tracking, you\u2019ll need to recharge it daily. Inside the 41mm is a 300mAh battery, and while I had hoped the new processor might stretch this further, with the Always-On display enabled, you\u2019re still going to have an issue stretching more than a day \u2013 especially with a workout or two and sleep tracking. Samsung has released a patch for battery performance, but I didn\u2019t notice a difference here \u2026 though others I\u2019ve spoken with can stretch a little bit longer with the 44mm that contains a larger battery.\nMuch of the Galaxy Watch 7 experience here is tried and true Samsung, both in what it can do and the form it presents itself in. The new AI features are pretty nice, and I\u2019m especially a fan of the context that the Energy Score can provide here \u2013 it takes a few days to get used to, but compared to the Oura or Fitbit, it is missing some things. It\u2019s also entirely reliant on sleep tracking and activity from the day before, which means you will need to recharge daily.\nThese AI-health features aren\u2019t necessarily a reason to upgrade, though, as they are arriving on older Galaxy Watch models, including the 6 and 6 Classic. Given that there aren\u2019t massive leaps in performance or design, the Galaxy Watch 7 is best for those with a Watch 5 or older or someone entirely new to the wearable category from Samsung. Then, though, I\u2019d also recommend you check out the Galaxy Ring.\nHowever, alongside two entirely new wearables from Samsung \u2013 the Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Ring \u2013 the Galaxy Watch 7 plays it safe with familiarity and great performance. Just remember to charge it.\n- Performance score: 4 / 5\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: Scorecard\n| Category | Comment | Score |\n| Value | Row 1 - Cell 1 | Row 1 - Cell 2 |\n| Design | Even with no changes, the Watch 7 still offers a sleek, modern experience with an easy method for changing bands. | 4 / 5 |\n| Features | New feature like Energy Score make health data more actionable and Galaxy AI features aim to improve the expereince | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Performance | With Samsung's latest Exynos chip inside, the Watch 7 offers a zippy experience, but we wish the improvements extended to battery life | 4 / 5 |\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: Should I Buy?\nBuy it if...\nYou have a Samsung smartphone\nGiven the deep integration with Samsung Health and that you need a Galaxy phone for certain features, it\u2019s the best option if you have a Samsung phone\nYou don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles of the Ultra\nEven without a more rugged design or a custom button, the Galaxy Watch 7 offers the same performance, a just as vibrant screen, the latest health sensor stack, and the new Energy Score features for a more affordable price\nYou like a sleek, simple build\nIf you\u2019re a fan of a sleek, circular smartwatch, the Galaxy Watch 7 is the best choice.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou have a Galaxy Watch 6\nAsides from similar looks, performance is pretty close and your current Galaxy Watch 6 will get Energy Score and Wellness tips.\nYou need multi-day battery life\nThe Galaxy Watch 7 with the always-on display enabled will not last for more than a day, so you\u2019ll want to look elsewhere if you\u2019re after endurance\nHow I Tested The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7\nTo effectively test the Galaxy Watch 7 and evaluate its overall performance as well as specific features, I used it as my daily driver for several weeks, dating back to the day Samsung unveiled it at its July 2024 Galaxy Unpacked. I first unboxed and set up the Galaxy Watch 7, pairing it with a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Then, I fully charged it, strapped it onto my left wrist, and began using it daily.\nI used it with various applications, including those pre-loaded courtesy of Samsung and Google, as part of the WearOS experience. Those included personal and productivity applications like messages, mail, calendar, weather, activity, health, and Spotify, among others. For the various health features, including Energy Score, I wore it for several days to establish a baseline for daily activity. I tracked workouts like indoor cycling, strength, yoga, meditation, running, and walking.\nFor battery life, I monitored what I got from the Galaxy Watch 7 daily and noted how often I charged it. I also tested the extreme battery-saver modes and used the Watch 7 with the always-on enabled and disabled. I compared the battery life, general performance, and health or activity tracking with other wearables, including the Galaxy Watch 6, Pixel Watch 2, Apple Watch SE second-generation, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Oura Ring.\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

      "text": "Best Labor Day sales 2025: when deals start and offers you can shop right now\nEarly Labor Day sales are live - shop today's best deals\nThe 2025 Labor Day sales event is just weeks away (officially on Monday, September 1), which means massive savings are coming your way on everything from patio furniture, appliances, and mattresses to TVs, Apple devices, and smart home gadgets.\nAs TechRadar's deals editor, who has covered Labor Day sales for eight years, I've put together this guide with everything you need to know about the upcoming holiday event.\nSo what deals can you expect to see during Labor Day? The biggest categories include clearance prices on major appliances and outdoor items such as patio furniture from retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's. You'll also find record-low prices on mattresses, tech gadgets like TVs and Apple devices, small appliances, and clothing.\nWhile most retailers will launch official Memorial Day sales during the last week of August, popular mattress brands like DreamCloud, Nectar, and Helix have early offers that you can shop right now, and I've listed those below, along with today's best offers from Amazon, Walmart, and Target. You'll also find a list of today's top deals on tech gadgets, kitchen appliances, vacuums, and clothing.\nI'll update this page with more early offers as soon as they become available, so make sure to bookmark this guide for all the latest bargains.\nToday's best early Labor Day sales\n- Amazon: 50% off TVs, AirPods & vacuums\n- Apple: iPads, AirPods & MacBooks from $99\n- Back-to-school: tech, supplies & clothing from $9\n- Bear: 35% off mattresses & pillows\n- Best Buy: $1,000 off TVs, laptops & headphones\n- Casper: 20% off all mattresses\n- DreamCloud: up to 60% off mattresses - deals from $399\n- Helix: 20% off all mattresses with code LDW20\n- Home Depot: 35% off appliances, furniture, grills & tools\n- Lowe's: 30% off major appliances\n- Nectar: mattress deals from $349, up to 50% off\n- Samsung: up to $1,500 off major appliances\n- Target: 30% off patio, clothing & accessories\n- Walmart: grills, mattresses, cheap TVs & vacs from $69\nToday's best early Labor Day deals\nDreamCloud Hybrid Mattress: was from $839 now $399 at DreamCloud\nDreamCloud has launched an early access Labor Day sale, with up to 60% off all mattresses. Our top pick is the top-rated DreamCloud Hybrid, and with the current discount, you can get a queen size for $649. That makes the DreamCloud Hybrid a smart buy if you need a more budget-friendly and affordable mattress without compromising too much on quality.\nAirPods are a back-to-school essential, and Amazon has Apple's all-new AirPods 4 on sale for $99 - only $10 more than the record-low price. The AirPods 4 feature a new design for all-day comfort and feature Apple's H2 chip, which supports personalized spatial audio and voice isolation. You also get a redesigned case with 30 hours of battery life and support for USB-C for wireless charging.\nMake your beloved iced coffee at home and save money with the Keurig K-Iced coffee maker, which is on sale for $59. The coffee maker can brew hot and cold coffee in minutes with Keurig's convenient K-Cup Pods.\nIf you're shopping for a big-screen budget TV, this Insignia 70-inch display is an outstanding deal at only $329.99. The Insignia F50 Series TV features 4K HD resolution, DTS Studio Sound, smart capabilities with the Fire OS, and a voice remote with hands-free Alexa, allowing you to use your voice to control your TV.\nIt's only $30 off, but let's not forget that this was already one of the best budget-friendly air fryers on the market, which we also awarded four stars in our review. The 4-quart ceramic-coated basket is perfect for cooking and crisping food, with a capacity of around 2 pounds of French fries. It's also easy to use, with three preset functions and dishwasher-safe parts for effortless cleanup.\nProcessor: Intel Core i3\nRAM: 8GB\nStorage: 256GB\nBest Buy's weekend sale has HP's 15.6-inch touch-screen laptop down to just $319.99. You get an Intel i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD to ensure excellent overall performance and enough essential speedy storage for the price. Overall, it's a great entry-level option to handle all everyday jobs, some more advanced work, and light multitasking.\nThe ultra-light Bissell CleanView vacuum features a compact design, making it easy to store in small spaces. The Bissell vacuum also features powerful suction and a triple-action brush roll to pick up pet hair seamlessly. Today's early Labor Day deal from Amazon brings the price down to just $157.49 - just $10 more than the record-low price.\nThe Sony WH-1000MX4 are older now, but they are still some of the best over-ear headphones ever. These wireless Sony cans package together top-notch audio, excellent comfort, and effective noise cancellation all at a reasonable price point that's about $100 less than the newer Sony XM5 that are only a minor upgrade.\nNectar Memory Foam mattress: was from $965 now $349\nNectar's early access Labor Day sale is live and features an impressive 50% off all mattresses, plus 66% off bundles. This takes the popular Memory Foam Mattress down to just $349 for the Twin size and $649 for the Queen size. All Nectar mattresses come with a lifetime warranty and a year's risk-free trial, so you'll have plenty of time to ensure it suits you.\nThis is the lowest price we've seen for Amazon's premium streaming device when you apply code 4KMAXADD at checkout. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max streams the same content in the same quality as the standard 4K version, but the extra power inside means faster performance when navigating apps. Plus, it uses WiFi 6E technology to give you a more stable and consistent streaming experience.\nProcessor: Apple M4\nRAM: 16GB\nStorage: 256GB\nAmazon has a $200 discount on the latest MacBook Air - a fantastic deal if you're looking for an everyday laptop. While this particular model is a relatively iterative upgrade over the previous 2024 M3 version, it remains more powerful and more power-efficient, and features 16GB of RAM right out of the box. Overall, it's an excellent purchase for students looking to upgrade to a MacBook laptop.\nThe Ninja Creami ice cream maker has been a best-seller since its release, and Walmart has the popular appliance for $169. You can make ice cream, milkshakes, and sorbets with the touch of a button and add your favorite mix-ins and flavors.\nThe all-new LG C5 was just released in March of this year, and Best Buy has the 55-inch model on sale for $1,299.99. That's a $500 discount and a new record-low price. Awarded five out of five stars in our review, the OLED display delivers an outstanding picture thanks to LG's Alpha 9 AI processor Gen8, impressive gaming features, and a comprehensive smart platform featuring all-new AI capabilities.\nAmazon has the top-rated Oral-B iO deep clean on sale for just $59.99 \u2013 the lowest price we've seen this year.

The most significant upgrade compared to the previous generation model is the latest A16 chip for faster performance. You also get double the storage of 128GB as standard, a sharp 11-inch Liquid Retina display, and solid 12MP front and back cameras.\nLabor Day sales 2025: FAQs\nWhen is Labor Day 2025?\nLabor Day is a national holiday that occurs on the first Monday of September each year. This year, the holiday will fall on Monday, September 1.\nLabor Day celebrates the contributions and achievements of American workers and was first observed back in 1882. Labor Day is also the unofficial end to summer, as most schools resume classes after the holiday weekend.\nWhen do Labor Day sales start?\nThe question of when Labor Day sales start depends on the category and retailer. Mattress brands are typically the first to kick off early Memorial Day sales, and we've already seen early offers live from brands like DreamCloud, Nectar, and Bear. We should see more early sales launch in the coming weeks.\nAppliances are the next category to launch Memorial Day sales, typically in mid-August, from retailers like Lowe's, Best Buy, and Home Depot.\nThe big online retailers, such as Amazon, Target, and Walmart, usually wait until the week before Memorial Day to kick off their events, which will be on August 25.\nWhat Labor Day deals can you expect?\nBecause Labor Day is the unofficial end to summer, you can find clearance prices on best-selling outdoor items as retailers try to clear out this year's stock. You'll find record-low prices on patio furniture, grills, and lawnmowers from Home Depot and Lowe's, to name a few.\nLabor Day also features impressive discounts on big-ticket items like furniture, major appliances, and mattresses.\nLabor Day sales coincide with back-to-school promotions, so you can find deals on clothing and tech gadgets, including laptops, tablets, headphones, and Apple devices.\nOther popular Labor Day categories include TVs, smartwatches, and small appliances from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nI've been covering Labor Day sales for over half a decade, and our team of deals experts has over twenty years of experience collectively.
