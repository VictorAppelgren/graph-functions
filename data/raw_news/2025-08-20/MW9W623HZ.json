  "content": "A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after the major indices continued to pull back, with technology stocks accounting for most of the market's largest decliners. A key reason for this trend is that much of the recent market gains were concentrated in the \"AI trade,\" which includes these large technology and semiconductor companies. So this could also mean that some investors are locking in some gains ahead of more definitive feedback from the Fed.\n\nDespite the downturn, some analysts viewed this as an opportunity to own some of the \"Core AI winners.\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities commented, \"In our view, the tech bull cycle will be well intact for at least another 2-3 years, given the trillions being spent on AI infrastructure/software/chips/power/apps looking ahead. This remains our tech playbook and investor roadmap.\" Additionally, mixed earnings reports from retailers, such as Target, have added to the market's weakness. Investors are closely monitoring these reports for insights into the broader economic health and the potential impact of new tariffs on inflation.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\u2022 Modern Fast Food company Noodles (NASDAQ:NDLS) fell 5.8%.

Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nGoodRx\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 29 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock gained 40.2% on the news that the company announced a collaboration with pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk to offer the popular medications Ozempic and Wegovy for $499 per month to eligible self-paying customers. This landmark collaboration makes the popular GLP-1 medications\u2014used for type 2 diabetes (Ozempic) and weight loss (Wegovy)\u2014available at a significantly lower cost to those who lack adequate insurance coverage. According to the announcement, this marks the first time Ozempic has been offered at this self-pay price point. The offer is effective immediately and available through the GoodRx platform at over 70,000 retail pharmacies nationwide. Investors reacted positively, viewing the strategic partnership as a pivotal move that could substantially expand GoodRx's market reach and user base by capitalizing on the high-demand therapeutic category.",

      "text": "CarMax (KMX)\nCarMax faces an uphill battle. Its sales have underperformed and its low returns on capital show it has few growth opportunities.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think CarMax Will Underperform\nKnown for its transparent, customer-centric approach and wide selection of vehicles, Carmax (NYSE:KMX) is the largest automotive retailer in the United States.\n- Poor same-store sales performance over the past two years indicates it\u2019s having trouble bringing new shoppers into its brick-and-mortar locations\n- Commoditized inventory, bad unit economics, and high competition are reflected in its low gross margin of 10.8%\n- High net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 15\u00d7 increases the risk of forced asset sales or dilutive financing if operational performance weakens\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than CarMax\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than CarMax\nAt $59.48 per share, CarMax trades at 15.1x forward P/E. The current valuation may be appropriate, but we\u2019re still not buyers of the stock.\nWe\u2019d rather invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with more reliable earnings growth.\n3. CarMax (KMX) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nUsed automotive vehicle retailer Carmax (NYSE:KMX) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 6.1% year on year to $7.55 billion. Its GAAP profit of $1.38 per share was 18.3% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nCarMax (KMX) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $7.55 billion vs analyst estimates of $7.57 billion (6.1% year-on-year growth, in line)\n- EPS (GAAP): $1.38 vs analyst estimates of $1.17 (18.3% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 3.1%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $144 million, up from -$221.6 million in the same quarter last year\n- Locations: 250 at quarter end, up from 245 in the same quarter last year\n- Same-Store Sales rose 6.6% year on year (-6.1% in the same quarter last year, beat vs expectations of up 6.3%)\n- Market Capitalization: $9.8 billion\nCompany Overview\nKnown for its transparent, customer-centric approach and wide selection of vehicles, Carmax (NYSE:KMX) is the largest automotive retailer in the United States.\nFounded in 1993, the company is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, and operates over 200 stores across the country. Carmax offers a unique car buying experience by providing customers with a no-haggle, no-pressure environment where they can browse a wide selection of high-quality used cars, and take them for test drives without a salesperson. Carmax also offers a range of services such as financing, warranties, and trade-ins.\nThe core customer for Carmax is someone who is looking for a used car but wants a hassle-free, transparent buying process. Typically, these customers are looking for a car that is less than five years old and has low mileage. Carmax addresses their needs by offering a wide selection of high-quality used cars at competitive prices. Customers can also take advantage of the company's financing options, which include pre-approval and a range of payment plans.\nThe average Carmax store is around 50,000 square feet and is located in suburban or urban areas. The stores are laid out in a way that makes it easy for customers to browse the cars and take them for test drives. The cars are organized by make and model, and customers can easily find information about each car's features, history, and pricing.\nCarmax launched its e-commerce presence in 2019. Customers can browse and purchase cars online, as well as schedule a test drive and arrange for delivery or pickup. The company's online platform also includes a range of resources such as car reviews, buying guides, and financing calculators.\nAn interesting fact about Carmax is that the company has been consistently ranked as one of the best companies to work for by Fortune magazine. This is in part due to the company's commitment to employee development and training, as well as its focus on creating a positive work culture. Carmax also supports various community initiatives, such as providing funding for education and job training programs.\n4. Vehicle Retailer\nBuying a vehicle is a big decision and usually the second-largest purchase behind a home for many people, so retailers that sell new and used cars try to offer selection, convenience, and customer service to shoppers. While there is online competition, especially for research and discovery, the vehicle sales market is still very fragmented and localized given the magnitude of the purchase and the logistical costs associated with moving cars over long distances. At the end of the day, a large swath of the population relies on cars to get from point A to point B, and vehicle sellers are acutely aware of this need.\nCompetitors in the auto retail space include AutoNation (NYSE:AN), Carvana (NYSE:CVNA), Group 1 Automotive (NYSE:GPI), and Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD).\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years.\nWith $26.79 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, CarMax is one of the larger companies in the consumer retail industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there is only so much real estate to build new stores, placing a ceiling on its growth. To accelerate sales, CarMax likely needs to optimize its pricing or lean into international expansion.\nAs you can see below, CarMax grew its sales at a tepid 6.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last six years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts).\nThis quarter, CarMax grew its revenue by 6.1% year on year, and its $7.55 billion of revenue was in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.3% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last six years. We still think its growth trajectory is satisfactory given its scale and implies the market sees success for its products.\n6. Store Performance\nNumber of Stores\nA retailer\u2019s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.\nCarMax operated 250 locations in the latest quarter. It has opened new stores quickly over the last two years, averaging 2.6% annual growth, faster than the broader consumer retail sector.\nWhen a retailer opens new stores, it usually means it\u2019s investing for growth because demand is greater than supply, especially in areas where consumers may not have a store within reasonable driving distance.\nSame-Store Sales\nThe change in a company's store base only tells one side of the story. The other is the performance of its existing locations and e-commerce sales, which informs management teams whether they should expand or downsize their physical footprints. Same-store sales is an industry measure of whether revenue is growing at those existing stores and is driven by customer visits (often called traffic) and the average spending per customer (ticket).\nCarMax\u2019s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 2% annual declines. This performance is concerning - it shows CarMax artificially boosts its revenue by building new stores. We\u2019d like to see a company\u2019s same-store sales rise before it takes on the costly, capital-intensive endeavor of expanding its store base.\nIn the latest quarter, CarMax\u2019s same-store sales rose 6.6% year on year. This growth was a well-appreciated turnaround from its historical levels, showing the business is regaining momentum.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nCarMax has bad unit economics for a retailer, signaling it operates in a competitive market and lacks pricing power because its inventory is sold in many places. As you can see below, it averaged a 10.8% gross margin over the last two years. That means CarMax paid its suppliers a lot of money ($89.22 for every $100 in revenue) to run its business.\nIn Q2, CarMax produced a 11.8% gross profit margin, in line with the same quarter last year and exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 4.9%. On a wider time horizon, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past four quarters, suggesting it strives to keep prices low for customers and has stable input costs (such as labor and freight expenses to transport goods).\n8. Operating Margin\nCarMax\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months but has remained more or less the same, averaging 2.7% over the last two years. This profitability was lousy for a consumer retail business and caused by its suboptimal cost structureand low gross margin.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, CarMax\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nThis quarter, CarMax generated an operating margin profit margin of 3.1%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nCarMax\u2019s full-year EPS was flat over the last five years, worse than the broader consumer retail sector.\nIn Q2, CarMax reported EPS at $1.38, up from $0.97 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects CarMax\u2019s full-year EPS of $3.62 to grow 8.5%.\n10. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nCarMax has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.2%, subpar for a consumer retail business.\nCarMax\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $144 million in Q2, equivalent to a 1.9% margin. Its cash flow turned positive after being negative in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend.\n11. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nCarMax historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 3.7%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for consumer retail companies.\n12. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nCarMax\u2019s $19.29 billion of debt exceeds the $262.8 million of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 15\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $1.23 billion over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged.\nAt this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company\u2019s rating if profitability falls. CarMax could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly \u2013 a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies.\nWe hope CarMax can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt.\n13. Key Takeaways from CarMax\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing CarMax beat analysts\u2019 same-store sales and gross margin expectations this quarter. This led to nice EPS outperformance versus Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a solid quarter. The stock traded up 9.3% to $70.30 immediately after reporting.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy CarMax?\nUpdated: July 16, 2025 at 10:51 PM EDT\nWe think that the latest earnings result is only one piece of the bigger puzzle. If you\u2019re deciding whether to own CarMax, you should also grasp the company\u2019s longer-term business quality and valuation.\nWe see the value of companies helping consumers, but in the case of CarMax, we\u2019re out. For starters, its revenue growth was a little slower over the last six years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its new store openings show it\u2019s growing its brand, the downside is its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. On top of that, its gross margins make it more challenging to reach positive operating profits compared to other consumer retail businesses.\nCarMax\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 15.9x. This valuation multiple is fair, but we don\u2019t have much confidence in the company. There are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $85.26 on the company (compared to the current share price of $63.81).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Summary\nWhy We Think Custom Truck One Source Will Underperform\nInspired by a family gas station, Custom Truck One Source (NYSE:CTOS) is a distributor of trucks and heavy equipment.\n- Cash burn makes us question whether it can achieve sustainable long-term growth\n- Low returns on capital reflect management\u2019s struggle to allocate funds effectively\n- The good news is that its annual revenue growth of 19.3% over the past five years was outstanding, reflecting market share gains this cycle\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Custom Truck One Source\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Custom Truck One Source\nCustom Truck One Source\u2019s stock price of $6.03 implies a valuation ratio of 62.4x forward P/E. The current multiple is quite expensive, especially for the fundamentals of the business.\nWe\u2019d rather invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with more reliable earnings growth.\n3. Custom Truck One Source (CTOS) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHeavy equipment distributor Custom Truck One Source (NYSE:CTOS) announced better-than-expected revenue in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 20.9% year on year to $511.5 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $2.02 billion at the midpoint came in 2.7% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.13 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nCustom Truck One Source (CTOS) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $511.5 million vs analyst estimates of $466.7 million (20.9% year-on-year growth, 9.6% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$0.13 vs analyst estimates of -$0.04 (miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $93.43 million vs analyst estimates of $86.59 million (18.3% margin, 7.9% beat)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $2.02 billion at the midpoint\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $380 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $374.2 million\n- Operating Margin: 5.5%, up from 4.2% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $12.35 million, up from -$51.88 million in the same quarter last year\n- Backlog: $334.8 million at quarter end\n- Market Capitalization: $1.31 billion\nCompany Overview\nInspired by a family gas station, Custom Truck One Source (NYSE:CTOS) is a distributor of trucks and heavy equipment.\nThe company provides equipment for sectors such as construction, utility, forestry, and rail. For example, Custom Truck One Source supplies utility companies with bucket trucks and digger derricks, while construction firms rely on their specialized cranes and heavy equipment. Additionally, the company offers custom modifications to tailor equipment to unique project needs for optimal performance.\nThe primary revenue sources for Custom Truck One Source include equipment sales, rental fees, and service charges for custom modifications. Its business model focuses on providing its offerings through a network of locations across the United States.\nRecurring revenue is a meaningful part of the revenue base and generated through long-term rental agreements that include maintenance. Sales and ongoing custom modification services are more one-time in nature.\n4. Specialty Equipment Distributors\nHistorically, specialty equipment distributors have boasted deep selection and expertise in sometimes narrow areas like single-use packaging or unique lighting equipment. Additionally, the industry has evolved to include more automated industrial equipment and machinery over the last decade, driving efficiencies and enabling valuable data collection. Specialty equipment distributors whose offerings keep up with these trends can take share in a still-fragmented market, but like the broader industrials sector, this space is at the whim of economic cycles that impact the capital spending and manufacturing propelling industry volumes.\nCompetitors in the equipment rental industry include WillScot (NASDAQ:WSC), Herc Holdings (NYSE:HRI), and United Rentals (NYSE:URI).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, Custom Truck One Source\u2019s 19.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth beat the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Custom Truck One Source\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 4.1% over the last two years was well below its five-year trend.\nCustom Truck One Source also breaks out the revenue for its most important segments, Equipment Rental and Aftermarket Parts and Services, which are 33.3% and 7.4% of revenue. Over the last two years, Custom Truck One Source\u2019s Equipment Rental revenue ( lifts, cranes, trucks) averaged 3.5% year-on-year declines. On the other hand, its Aftermarket Parts and Services revenue (maintenance and repair) averaged 1.2% growth.\nThis quarter, Custom Truck One Source reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 20.9%, and its $511.5 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 9.6%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 7.4% over the next 12 months. Although this projection implies its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nCustom Truck One Source\u2019s unit economics are better than the typical industrials business, signaling its products are somewhat differentiated through quality or brand. As you can see below, it averaged a decent 30.1% gross margin over the last five years. Said differently, Custom Truck One Source paid its suppliers $69.92 for every $100 in revenue.\nCustom Truck One Source\u2019s gross profit margin came in at 20% this quarter, down 1.1 percentage points year on year. Custom Truck One Source\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 2.2 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses).\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nCustom Truck One Source was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 5.2% was weak for an industrials business.\nOn the plus side, Custom Truck One Source\u2019s operating margin rose by 8 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it immense operating leverage.\nThis quarter, Custom Truck One Source generated an operating margin profit margin of 5.5%, up 1.3 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and because its gross margin actually decreased, we can assume it was more efficient because its operating expenses like marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead grew slower than its revenue.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAlthough Custom Truck One Source\u2019s full-year earnings are still negative, it reduced its losses and improved its EPS by 30.2% annually over the last five years. The next few quarters will be critical for assessing its long-term profitability.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.\nSadly for Custom Truck One Source, its EPS declined by 65.9% annually over the last two years while its revenue grew by 4.1%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nWe can take a deeper look into Custom Truck One Source\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. While we mentioned earlier that Custom Truck One Source\u2019s operating margin expanded this quarter, a two-year view shows its margin has declined by 3.2 percentage points. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, Custom Truck One Source reported EPS at negative $0.13, down from negative $0.10 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Custom Truck One Source\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $0.16 will reach break even.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nWhile Custom Truck One Source posted positive free cash flow this quarter, the broader story hasn\u2019t been so clean. Custom Truck One Source\u2019s demanding reinvestments have drained its resources over the last five years, putting it in a pinch and limiting its ability to return capital to investors. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 10%, meaning it lit $10.00 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Custom Truck One Source\u2019s margin dropped by 24.4 percentage points during that time. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because it\u2019s already burning cash. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it\u2019s becoming a more capital-intensive business.\nCustom Truck One Source\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $12.35 million in Q2, equivalent to a 2.4% margin. Its cash flow turned positive after being negative in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nCustom Truck One Source historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 2.4%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for industrials companies.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Custom Truck One Source\u2019s ROIC averaged 3.9 percentage point increases each year. This is a good sign, and we hope the company can continue improving.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nCustom Truck One Source reported $5.26 million of cash and $1.72 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $349.1 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Custom Truck One Source\u2019s 4.9\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $85.5 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Custom Truck One Source\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe liked that Custom Truck One Source beat analysts\u2019 revenue and EBITDA expectations this quarter. Looking ahead, full-year EBITDA guidance also beat. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $5.71 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Custom Truck One Source?\nUpdated: August 18, 2025 at 11:09 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Custom Truck One Source.\nCustom Truck One Source isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. Although its revenue growth was exceptional over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. And while the company\u2019s expanding operating margin shows the business has become more efficient, the downside is its cash profitability fell over the last five years.\nCustom Truck One Source\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 63.6x. Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we think the potential downside is too great. We're fairly confident there are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $7.20 on the company (compared to the current share price of $6.14).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Noodles Will Underperform\nOffering pasta, mac and cheese, pad thai, and more, Noodles & Company (NASDAQ:NDLS) is a casual restaurant chain that serves all manner of noodles from around the world.\n- Sales trends were unexciting over the last six years as its 1.2% annual growth was below the typical restaurant company\n- Persistent operating margin losses suggest the business manages its expenses poorly\n- High net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 6\u00d7 increases the risk of forced asset sales or dilutive financing if operational performance weakens\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Noodles\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Noodles\nNoodles\u2019s stock price of $0.70 implies a valuation ratio of 2.3x forward EV-to-EBITDA. This multiple is high given its weaker fundamentals.\nWe\u2019d rather pay a premium for quality. Cheap stocks can look like a great deal at first glance, but they can be value traps. Less earnings power means more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns; this can be an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Noodles (NDLS) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nCasual restaurant chain Noodles & Company (NASDAQ:NDLS) fell short of the market\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales flat year on year at $126.4 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $491 million at the midpoint came in 3.6% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.12 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nNoodles (NDLS) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $126.4 million vs analyst estimates of $131.6 million (flat year on year, 3.9% miss)\n- Adjusted EPS: -$0.12 vs analyst estimates of -$0.06 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $6.02 million vs analyst estimates of $7.61 million (4.8% margin, 20.9% miss)\n- The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year to $491 million at the midpoint from $507.5 million, a 3.3% decrease\n- Operating Margin: -11.7%, down from 1% in the same quarter last year\n- Locations: 453 at quarter end, down from 473 in the same quarter last year\n- Same-Store Sales rose 1.5% year on year, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $50.54 million\nCompany Overview\nOffering pasta, mac and cheese, pad thai, and more, Noodles & Company (NASDAQ:NDLS) is a casual restaurant chain that serves all manner of noodles from around the world.\nThe company was founded in 1995 by Aaron Kennedy in Denver, Colorado and birthed from the simple idea that according to the company, \u201cpeople love noodles\u201d. The cornerstone of the Noodles & Company offering is not just noodles but fresh, made-to-order dishes.\nAs mentioned, the menu features noodles from all over the world from Japanese pan noodles to stuffed pastas. In addition to standard menu items, customers can also create their own concoctions by picking noodle types, sauces, and add-ons. Finally, Noodles & Company aims to stay attuned to evolving dietary preferences and offers numerous gluten-free, vegetarian, and low-calorie options.\nThe core Noodles & Company customer is diverse. Maybe it\u2019s a college student looking for a quick bite or a businessperson seeking a convenient but comforting lunch. Families are also a target customer because everyone can find or create something they like, including kids who can select from the children\u2019s menu. Inside Noodles & Company locations, you\u2019ll find an inviting atmosphere with tables and booths surrounded by neutral colors. However, many customers choose to take out.\n4. Modern Fast Food\nModern fast food is a relatively newer category representing a middle ground between traditional fast food and sit-down restaurants. These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality. These eateries are capitalizing on the perception that your drive-through burger and fries joint is detrimental to your health because of inferior ingredients.\nCompetitors offering convenient and casual dining options include Potbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Sweetgreen (NYSE:SG), and Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years.\nWith $494.8 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Noodles is a small restaurant chain, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better brand awareness and economies of scale.\nAs you can see below, Noodles grew its sales at a weak 1.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last six years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts).This quarter, Noodles missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.7% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $126.4 million of revenue.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.8% over the next 12 months. While this projection implies its newer menu offerings will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n6. Restaurant Performance\nNumber of Restaurants\nThe number of dining locations a restaurant chain operates is a critical driver of how quickly company-level sales can grow.\nNoodles operated 453 locations in the latest quarter. It has generally opened new restaurants over the last two years and averaged 1% annual growth, faster than the broader restaurant sector.\nWhen a chain opens new restaurants, it usually means it\u2019s investing for growth because there\u2019s healthy demand for its meals and there are markets where its concepts have few or no locations.\nSame-Store Sales\nThe change in a company's restaurant base only tells one side of the story. The other is the performance of its existing locations, which informs management teams whether they should expand or downsize their physical footprints. Same-store sales is an industry measure of whether revenue is growing at those existing restaurants and is driven by customer visits (often called traffic) and the average spending per customer (ticket).\nNoodles\u2019s demand within its existing dining locations has barely increased over the last two years as its same-store sales were flat. Noodles should consider improving its foot traffic and efficiency before expanding its restaurant base.\nIn the latest quarter, Noodles\u2019s same-store sales rose 1.5% year on year. This growth was a well-appreciated turnaround from its historical levels, showing the business is regaining momentum.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nGross profit margins tell us how much money a restaurant gets to keep after paying for the direct costs of the meals it sells, like ingredients, and indicate its level of pricing power.\nNoodles has bad unit economics for a restaurant company, signaling it operates in a competitive market and has little room for error if demand unexpectedly falls. As you can see below, it averaged a 15.2% gross margin over the last two years. That means Noodles paid its suppliers a lot of money ($84.83 for every $100 in revenue) to run its business.\nIn Q2, Noodles produced a 14.6% gross profit margin, marking a 2.7 percentage point decrease from 17.3% in the same quarter last year. Noodles\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 3.1 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs (such as ingredients and transportation expenses).\n8. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nThe restaurant business is tough to succeed in because of its unpredictability, whether it be employees not showing up for work, sudden changes in consumer preferences, or the cost of ingredients skyrocketing thanks to supply shortages.Noodles has been a victim of these challenges over the last two years, and its high expenses have contributed to an average operating margin of negative 2.5%.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Noodles\u2019s operating margin decreased by 5.5 percentage points over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Noodles\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nThis quarter, Noodles generated a negative 11.7% operating margin. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for Noodles, its EPS declined by 47.8% annually over the last six years while its revenue grew by 1.2%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nIn Q2, Noodles reported adjusted EPS of negative $0.12, down from negative $0.05 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts\u2019 consensus projections, but there is insufficient data.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nGrowth gives us insight into a company\u2019s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nNoodles\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 0.8%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the restaurant sector.\n11. Balance Sheet Risk\nDebt is a tool that can boost company returns but presents risks if used irresponsibly. As long-term investors, we aim to avoid companies taking excessive advantage of this instrument because it could lead to insolvency.\nNoodles\u2019s $106.4 million of debt exceeds the $2.3 million of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 6\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $17.33 million over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged.\nAt this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company\u2019s rating if profitability falls. Noodles could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly \u2013 a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies.\nWe hope Noodles can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt.\n12. Key Takeaways from Noodles\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results. Its full-year revenue guidance missed and its revenue fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 12.9% to $0.88 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Noodles?\nUpdated: August 19, 2025 at 10:50 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Noodles or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nWe cheer for all companies serving everyday consumers, but in the case of Noodles, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. To begin with, its revenue growth was weak over the last six years. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its brand caters to a niche market. On top of that, its declining EPS over the last six years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nNoodles\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 2.3x. At this valuation, there\u2019s a lot of good news priced in - we think there are better opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $2 on the company (compared to the current share price of $0.70).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

      "text": "Micron (MU)\nMicron piques our interest. Its excellent projected revenue growth suggests it\u2019s poised to win significant market share.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Micron Is Interesting\nFounded in the basement of a Boise, Idaho dental office in 1978, Micron (NYSE:MU) is a leading provider of memory chips used in thousands of devices across mobile, data centers, industrial, consumer, and automotive markets.\n- Exciting sales outlook for the upcoming 12 months calls for 40% growth, an acceleration from its two-year trend\n- Additional sales over the last five years increased its profitability as the 22.8% annual growth in its earnings per share outpaced its revenue\n- A blemish is its gross margin of 27.2% is below its competitors, leaving less money to invest in areas like marketing and R&D\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Micron?\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Micron?\nMicron\u2019s stock price of $121.53 implies a valuation ratio of 12.2x forward P/E. A number of semiconductor companies feature higher multiples, but that doesn\u2019t make Micron a bargain. In fact, we think the current price justly reflects the top-line growth.\nIt could be a good time to invest if you see something the market doesn\u2019t.\n3. Micron (MU) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nMemory chips maker Micron (NYSE:MU) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 36.6% year on year to $9.30 billion. On top of that, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance ($10.7 billion at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 7.2% above what analysts were expecting. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.91 per share was 18.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nMicron (MU) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $9.30 billion vs analyst estimates of $8.86 billion (36.6% year-on-year growth, 4.9% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $1.91 vs analyst estimates of $1.61 (18.9% beat)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $2.49 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.14 billion (26.8% margin, 16.6% beat)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $10.7 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $9.99 billion\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $2.50 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $2.03\n- Operating Margin: 23.3%, up from 10.6% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 18%, up from 5.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Inventory Days Outstanding: 137, down from 161 in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $142.9 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in the basement of a Boise, Idaho dental office in 1978, Micron (NYSE:MU) is a leading provider of memory chips used in thousands of devices across mobile, data centers, industrial, consumer, and automotive markets.\nMicron is one of the leading producers of both DRAM and NAND memory chips globally, though DRAM has consistently accounted for the majority of Micron\u2019s revenues. Micron\u2019s DRAM is mostly used in PCs, servers, networking gear, along with industrial and automotive verticals. NAND is used in the same end markets, along with a heavy weighting in consumer devices like smartphones and tablets.\nMemory has the most volatile pricing dynamics in the semiconductors industry, which can result in Micron\u2019s earnings results fluctuating wildly. As a result Micron\u2019s valuation will often appear abnormally low compared to other semiconductors during the peak of the memory cycle, with the stock often trading for low to mid single digit forward earnings multiples (4x-8x) before dramatically expanding to high teens to mid twenties (18x-24x) when the cycle turns down.\nMicron\u2019s peers and competitors include Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), SK Hynix (KOSI:000660), and Samsung (KOSI:005930).\n4. Memory Semiconductors\nThe global memory chip market has become concentrated due to the highly commoditized nature of these semiconductors. Despite the market consolidation, DRAM and NAND are subject to wide pricing swings as supply and demand ebbs and flows. This plays itself out in the business models of memory producers, where the large, fixed cost bases required to produce memory chips in volume can become very profitable during times of rising prices due to high demand and tight supply but also can result in periods of low profitability when more supply is brought online or demand drops.\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Thankfully, Micron\u2019s 10.8% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was solid. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Micron\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 36.4% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated.\nThis quarter, Micron reported wonderful year-on-year revenue growth of 36.6%, and its $9.30 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 4.9%. Beyond the beat, this marks 7 straight quarters of growth, showing that the current upcycle has had a good run - a typical upcycle usually lasts 8-10 quarters. Company management is currently guiding for a 38.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 28.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Still, this projection is eye-popping given its scale and suggests the market is forecasting success for its products and services.\n6. Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory\nDays Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business\u2019 capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production.\nThis quarter, Micron\u2019s DIO came in at 137, which is 5 days below its five-year average. At the moment, these numbers show no indication of an excessive inventory buildup.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nIn the semiconductor industry, a company\u2019s gross profit margin is a critical metric to track because it sheds light on its pricing power, complexity of products, and ability to procure raw materials, equipment, and labor.\nMicron\u2019s gross margin is one of the worst in the semiconductor industry, signaling it operates in a competitive market and lacks pricing power. As you can see below, it averaged a 27.2% gross margin over the last two years. That means Micron paid its suppliers a lot of money ($72.82 for every $100 in revenue) to run its business.\nMicron produced a 37.7% gross profit margin in Q2, up 10.8 percentage points year on year. Micron\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending up over the past 12 months, increasing by 25.7 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a less competitive environment where the company has better pricing power and leverage from its growing sales on the fixed portion of its cost of goods sold (such as manufacturing expenses).\n8. Operating Margin\nMicron was profitable over the last two years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 10.8% was weak for a semiconductor business. This result isn\u2019t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.\nOn the plus side, Micron\u2019s operating margin rose by 5 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage.\nIn Q2, Micron generated an operating margin profit margin of 23.3%, up 12.8 percentage points year on year. The increase was solid, and because its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nMicron\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 22.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 10.8% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nDiving into the nuances of Micron\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Micron\u2019s operating margin expanded by 5 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its higher earnings; taxes and interest expenses can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, Micron reported EPS at $1.91, up from $0.62 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts\u2019 consensus projections, but there is insufficient data.\n10. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nMicron broke even from a free cash flow perspective over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that Micron\u2019s margin expanded by 3.4 percentage points over the last five years. We have no doubt shareholders would like to continue seeing its cash conversion rise as it gives the company more optionality.\nMicron\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $1.67 billion in Q2, equivalent to a 18% margin. This result was good as its margin was 12.2 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend.\n11. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nMicron historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 7.3%, somewhat low compared to the best semiconductor companies that consistently pump out 35%+.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nMicron reported $10.81 billion of cash and $15.54 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $16.83 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Micron\u2019s 0.3\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $8 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n13. Key Takeaways from Micron\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by Micron\u2019s strong improvement in inventory levels. We were also excited it beat analysts' estimates across all fundamental metrics for both this quarter and next quarter's guidance. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 3.5% to $131.92 immediately following the results.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Micron?\nUpdated: August 19, 2025 at 10:18 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Micron.\nThere are a lot of things to like about Micron. First off, its revenue growth was solid over the last five years and is expected to accelerate over the next 12 months. And while its low gross margins indicate some combination of pricing pressures or rising production costs, its remarkable EPS growth over the last five years shows its profits are trickling down to shareholders. On top of that, its expanding operating margin shows the business has become more efficient.\nMicron\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 12.2x. Looking at the semiconductor landscape right now, Micron trades at a pretty interesting price. If you believe in the company and its growth potential, now is an opportune time to buy shares.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $149.71 on the company (compared to the current share price of $121.53), implying they see 23.2% upside in buying Micron in the short term."

      "text": "GoodRx (GDRX)\nGoodRx faces an uphill battle. Its negative returns on capital raise questions about its ability to allocate resources and generate profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think GoodRx Will Underperform\nStarted in 2011 to tackle the problem of high prescription drug costs in America, GoodRx (NASDAQ:GDRX) operates a digital platform that helps consumers find lower prices on prescription medications through price comparison tools and discount codes.\n- Negative returns on capital show management lost money while trying to expand the business\n- Smaller revenue base of $799.9 million means it hasn\u2019t achieved the economies of scale that some industry juggernauts enjoy\n- Demand will likely fall over the next 12 months as Wall Street expects flat revenue\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than GoodRx\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than GoodRx\nAt $4.69 per share, GoodRx trades at 11.1x forward P/E. Yes, this valuation multiple is lower than that of other healthcare peers, but we\u2019ll remind you that you often get what you pay for.\nOur advice is to pay up for elite businesses whose advantages are tailwinds to earnings growth. Don\u2019t get sucked into lower-quality businesses just because they seem like bargains. These mediocre businesses often never achieve a higher multiple as hoped, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. GoodRx (GDRX) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHealthcare tech company GoodRx (NASDAQ:GDRX) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025 as sales only rose 1.2% year on year to $203.1 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.09 per share was in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nGoodRx (GDRX) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $203.1 million vs analyst estimates of $205.7 million (1.2% year-on-year growth, 1.3% miss)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.09 vs analyst estimates of $0.10 (in line)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $69.4 million vs analyst estimates of $70.62 million (34.2% margin, 1.7% miss)\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $270 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $279.7 million\n- Operating Margin: 13.2%, up from 9.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 4.7%, similar to the same quarter last year\n- Customers: 5.7 million, down from 6.4 million in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $1.67 billion\nCompany Overview\nStarted in 2011 to tackle the problem of high prescription drug costs in America, GoodRx (NASDAQ:GDRX) operates a digital platform that helps consumers find lower prices on prescription medications through price comparison tools and discount codes.\nGoodRx's platform processes over 320 billion pricing data points daily to provide consumers with geographically relevant prescription pricing information. When users find a lower price through GoodRx, they receive a discount code that can be presented at nearly any retail pharmacy in the United States. Once a consumer uses a GoodRx code at a pharmacy, that code is stored in the pharmacy's database for future refills, creating ongoing value for both the consumer and GoodRx.\nThe company generates revenue primarily when consumers use GoodRx codes to save money on prescriptions compared to pharmacy list prices. GoodRx has expanded beyond its core prescription price comparison tool to offer subscription services that provide even deeper discounts. Its Gold subscription offers lower prices at select pharmacies, mail delivery options, and other benefits for a monthly or annual fee.\nFor example, a consumer prescribed a common cholesterol medication might pay $150 at their local pharmacy using insurance, but could find the same medication for $20 using a GoodRx discount code. A Gold subscriber might access that same medication for just $10.\nGoodRx also partners with pharmaceutical manufacturers to advertise and integrate their affordability solutions for brand-name medications into its platform. The company's business model creates a network effect: as more consumers use GoodRx, the company gains leverage to negotiate better prices with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and pharmacies, which in turn attracts more consumers.\nBeyond prescription savings, GoodRx has expanded into telehealth through its GoodRx Care platform, which offers consumers access to virtual medical consultations on a cash-pay basis. The company also provides healthcare information through GoodRx Health, a content platform launched in 2021 that offers educational resources about medications and health conditions.\n4. Healthcare Technology for Patients\nThe consumer-focused healthcare technology sector leverages digital platforms to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, offering services like telemedicine and prescription discounts. Looking forward, growth is supported by increasing consumer comfort with telehealth and the demand for cost-saving tools amidst rising healthcare expenses. AI-powered diagnostics and personalized digital care also present significant opportunities. However, the sector faces headwinds from heightened competition as large technology and established healthcare companies expand their digital presence.\nGoodRx competes with other prescription discount providers like SingleCare and RxSaver, pharmacy benefit managers such as CVS Caremark (NYSE:CVS) and Express Scripts (part of Cigna Group, NYSE:CI), and digital healthcare platforms including Amazon Pharmacy (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company.\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $799.9 million in revenue over the past 12 months, GoodRx is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Luckily, GoodRx\u2019s sales grew at a decent 11.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth was slightly above the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. GoodRx\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 3.6% over the last two years was below its five-year trend.\nGoodRx also reports its number of customers, which reached 5.7 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, GoodRx\u2019s customer base averaged 2.9% year-on-year growth. Because this number is in line with its revenue growth, we can see the average customer spent roughly the same amount each year on the company\u2019s products and services.\nThis quarter, GoodRx\u2019s revenue grew by 1.2% year on year to $203.1 million, falling short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.8% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. While this projection suggests its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n7. Adjusted Operating Margin\nGoodRx has been an efficient company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the healthcare sector, boasting an average adjusted operating margin of 25.9%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, GoodRx\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 5.8 percentage points over the last five years, but it rose by 2.7 percentage points on a two-year basis. Still, shareholders will want to see GoodRx become more profitable in the future.\nThis quarter, GoodRx generated an adjusted operating margin profit margin of 25.8%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nGoodRx\u2019s EPS grew at an unimpressive 3.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, lower than its 11.1% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nWe can take a deeper look into GoodRx\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, GoodRx\u2019s adjusted operating margin was flat this quarter but declined by 5.8 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, GoodRx reported adjusted EPS at $0.09, up from $0.08 in the same quarter last year. Despite growing year on year, this print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects GoodRx to perform poorly. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of $0.35 will hit $0.42.\n9. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nGoodRx has shown robust cash profitability, giving it an edge over its competitors and the ability to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 18.2% over the last five years, quite impressive for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that GoodRx\u2019s margin expanded by 1.9 percentage points during that time. This shows the company is heading in the right direction, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose while its operating profitability fell.\nGoodRx\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $9.53 million in Q2, equivalent to a 4.7% margin. This cash profitability was in line with the comparable period last year but below its five-year average. In a silo, this isn\u2019t a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we\u2019ll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nGoodRx\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 19%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, GoodRx\u2019s ROIC has increased. This is a good sign, but we recognize its lack of profitable growth during the COVID era was the primary reason for the change.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nGoodRx reported $281.3 million of cash and $547.5 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $271.2 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view GoodRx\u2019s 1.0\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $13.12 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from GoodRx\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results. Its EPS missed and its customer base fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 5.2% to $4.12 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy GoodRx?\nUpdated: August 20, 2025 at 12:11 AM EDT\nWe think that the latest earnings result is only one piece of the bigger puzzle. If you\u2019re deciding whether to own GoodRx, you should also grasp the company\u2019s longer-term business quality and valuation.\nWe see the value of companies making people healthier, but in the case of GoodRx, we\u2019re out. Although its revenue growth was good over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. And while the company\u2019s rising cash profitability gives it more optionality, the downside is its subscale operations give it fewer distribution channels than its larger rivals.\nGoodRx\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 11.1x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think there are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $5.37 on the company (compared to the current share price of $4.69)."
