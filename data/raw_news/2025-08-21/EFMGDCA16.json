  "description": "SpaceX has built an impressive production site in Texas. Will Starship success follow?",
  "content": "STARBASE, Texas\u2014I first visited SpaceX's launch site in South Texas a decade ago. Driving down the pocked and barren two-lane road to its sandy terminus, I found only rolling dunes, a large mound of dirt, and a few satellite dishes that talked to Dragon spacecraft as they flew overhead. A few years later, in mid-2019, the company had moved some of that dirt and built a small launch pad. A handful of SpaceX engineers working there at the time shared some office space nearby in a tech hub building, \"Stargate.\" The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley proudly opened this state-of-the-art technology center just weeks earlier. That summer, from Stargate's second floor, engineers looked on as the Starhopper prototype made its first two flights a couple of miles away. Over the ensuing years, as the company began assembling its Starship rockets on site, SpaceX first erected small tents, then much larger tents, and then towering high bays in which the vehicles were stacked. Starbase grew and evolved to meet the company's needs. All of this was merely a prelude to the end game: Starfactory. SpaceX opened this truly massive facility earlier this year. The sleek rocket factory is emblematic of the new Starbase: modern, gargantuan, spaceship-like. To the consternation of some local residents and environmentalists, the rapid growth of Starbase has wiped out the small and eclectic community that existed here. And that brand new Stargate building that public officials were so excited about only a few years ago? SpaceX first took it over entirely and then demolished it. The tents are gone, too. For better or worse, in the name of progress, the SpaceX steamroller has rolled onward, paving all before it. Starbase is even its own Texas city now. And if this were a medieval town, Starfactory would be the impenetrable fortress at its heart. In late May, I had a chance to go inside. The interior was super impressive, of course. Yet it could not quell some of the concerns I have about the future of SpaceX's grand plans to send a fleet of Starships into the Solar System.\n\nThe main entrance to the factory lies at its northeast corner. From there, one walks into a sleek lobby that serves as a gateway into the main, cavernous section of the building. At this corner, there are three stories above the ground floor. Each of these three higher levels contains various offices, conference rooms and, on the upper floor, a launch control center. Large windows from here offer a breathtaking view of the Starship launch site two miles up the road. A third-floor executive conference room has carpet of a striking rusty, reddish hue\u2014mimicking the surface of Mars, naturally. A long, black table dominates the room, with 10 seats along each side, and one at the head. An aerial overview of the Starship production site in South Texas earlier this year. The sprawling Starfactory is in the center. An aerial overview of the Starship production site in South Texas earlier this year. The sprawling Starfactory is in the center. But the real attraction of these offices is the view to the other end. Each of the upper three floors has a balcony overlooking the factory floor. From there, it's as if one stands at the edge of an ocean liner, gazing out to sea. In this case, the far wall is discernible, if only barely. Below, the factory floor is crammed with all manner of Starship parts: nose cones, grid fins, hot staging rings, and so much more. The factory emitted a steady din and hum as work proceeded on vehicles below. The ultimate goal of this factory is to build one Starship rocket a day. This sounds utterly mad. For the entire Apollo program in the 1960s and 1970s, NASA built 15 Saturn V rockets. Over the course of more than three decades, NASA built and flew only five different iconic Space Shuttles. SpaceX aims to build 365 vehicles, which are larger, per year. Wandering around the Starfactory, however, this ambition no longer seems undoable. The factory measures about 1 million square feet. This is two times as large as SpaceX's main Falcon 9 factory in Hawthorne, California. It feels like the company could build a lot of Starships here if needed.\n\nDuring one of my visits to South Texas, in early 2020 just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, SpaceX was building its first Starship rockets in football field-sized tents. At the time, SpaceX founder Elon Musk opined in an interview that building the factory might well be more difficult than building the rocket. Here's a view of SpaceX's Starship production facilities, from the east side, in late February 2020. Here's a view of SpaceX's Starship production facilities, from the east side, in late February 2020. \"If you want to actually make something at reasonable volume, you have to build the machine that makes the machine, which mathematically is going to be vastly more complicated than the machine itself,\" he said. \"The thing that makes the machine is not going to be simpler than the machine. It\u2019s going to be much more complicated, by a lot.\" Five years later, standing inside Starfactory, it seems clear that SpaceX has built the machine to build the machine\u2014or at least it's getting close. But what happens if that machine is not ready for prime time? SpaceX has not had a good run of things with the ambitious Starship vehicle this year. Three times, in January, March, and May, the vehicle took flight. And three times, the upper stage experienced significant problems during ascent, and the vehicle was lost on the ride up to space, or just after. These were the seventh, eighth, and ninth test flights of Starship, following three consecutive flights in 2024 during which the Starship upper stage made more or less nominal flights and controlled splashdowns in the Indian Ocean. It's difficult to view the consecutive failures this year\u2014not to mention the explosion of another Starship vehicle during testing in June\u2014as anything but a major setback for the program. There can be no question that the Starship rocket, with its unprecedentedly large first stage and potentially reusable upper stage, is the most advanced and ambitious rocket humans have ever conceived, built, and flown. The failures this year, however, have led some space industry insiders to ask whether Starship is too ambitious.\n\nMy sources at SpaceX don't believe so. They are frustrated by the run of problems this year, but they believe the fundamental design of Starship is sound and that they have a clear path to resolving the issues. The massive first stage has already been flown, landed, and re-flown. This is a huge step forward. But the sources also believe the upper stage issues can be resolved, especially with a new \"Version 3\" of Starship due to make its debut late this year or early in 2026. The acid test will only come with upcoming flights. The vehicle's tenth test flight is scheduled to take place no earlier than Sunday, August 24. It's possible that SpaceX will fly one more \"Version 2\" Starship later this year before moving to the upgraded vehicle, with more powerful Raptor engines and lots of other changes to (hopefully) improve reliability. SpaceX could certainly use a win. The Starship failures occur at a time when Musk has become embroiled in political controversy while feuding with the president of the United States. His actions have led some in government and private industry to question whether they should be doing business with SpaceX going forward. It's often said in sports that winning solves a lot of problems. For SpaceX, success with Starship would solve a lot of problems. The failures are frustrating and publicly embarrassing. But more importantly, they are a bottleneck for a lot of critical work SpaceX needs to do for Starship to reach its considerable potential. All of the technical progress the Starship program needs to make to deploy thousands of Starlink satellites, land NASA astronauts on the Moon, and send humans to Mars remains largely on hold. Two of the most important objectives for the next flight require the Starship vehicle to fly a nominal mission. For several flights now, SpaceX engineers have dutifully prepared Starlink satellite simulators to test a Pez-like dispenser in space. And each Starship vehicle has carried about two dozen different tile experiments as the company attempts to build a rapidly reusable heat shield to protect Starship during atmospheric reentry.\n\nThe engineers are still waiting for the results of their experiments. In the near term, SpaceX is hyper-focused on getting Starship working and starting the deployment of large Starlink satellites that will have the potential to unlock significant amounts of revenue. But this is just the beginning of the work that needs to happen for SpaceX to turn Starship into a deep-space vehicle capable of traveling to the Moon and Mars.\n\u2022 Prop transfer: Conducting a refueling test in low-Earth orbit to demonstrate the transfer of large amounts of propellant between Starships\n\u2022 Depots: Developing and testing cryogenic propellant depots to understand heating losses over time\n\u2022 Lunar landing: Landing a Starship successfully on the Moon, which is challenging due to the height of the vehicle and uneven terrain\n\u2022 Lunar launch: Demonstrating the capability of Starship, using liquid propellant, to launch safely from the lunar surface without infrastructure there\n\u2022 Mars transit: Demonstrating the operation of Starship over months and the capability to perform a powered landing on Mars. Each of these steps is massively challenging and at least partly a novel exercise in aerospace. There will be a lot of learning, and almost certainly some failures, as SpaceX works through these technical milestones. Some details about the Starship propellant transfer test, a key milestone that NASA and SpaceX had hoped to complete this year but now may tackle in 2026. Some details about the Starship propellant transfer test, a key milestone that NASA and SpaceX had hoped to complete this year but now may tackle in 2026. SpaceX prefers a test, fly, and fix approach to developing hardware. This iterative approach has served the company well, allowing it to develop rockets and spacecraft faster and for less money than its competitors. But you cannot fly and fix hardware for the milestones above without getting the upper stage of Starship flying nominally. That's one reason why the Starship program has been so disappointing this year. Then there are the politics As SpaceX has struggled with Starship in 2025, its founder, Musk, has also had a turbulent run, from the presidential campaign trail to the top of political power in the world, the White House, and back out of President Trump's inner circle. Along the way, he has made political enemies, and his public favorability ratings have fallen.\n\nAmid the fallout between Trump and Musk this spring and summer, the president ordered a review of SpaceX's contracts. Nothing happened because government officials found that most of the services SpaceX offers to NASA, the US Department of Defense, and other federal agencies are vital. However, multiple sources have told Ars that federal officials are looking for alternatives to SpaceX and have indicated they will seek to buy launches, satellite Internet, and other services from emerging competitors if available. Starship's troubles also come at a critical time in space policy. As part of its budget request for fiscal year 2026, the White House sought to terminate the production of NASA's Space Launch System rocket and spacecraft after the Artemis III mission. The White House has also expressed an interest in sending humans to Mars, viewing the Moon as a stepping stone to the red planet. Although there are several options in play, the most viable hardware for both a lunar and Mars human exploration program is Starship. If it works. If it continues to have teething pains, though, that makes it easier for Congress to continue funding NASA's expensive rocket and spacecraft, as it would prefer to do. What about Artemis and the Moon? Starship's \"lost year\" also has serious implications for NASA's Artemis Moon Program. As Ars reported this week, China is now likely to land on the Moon before NASA can return. Yes, the space agency has a nominal landing date in 2027 for the Artemis III mission, but no credible space industry officials believe that date is real. (It has already slipped multiple times from 2024). Theoretically, a landing in 2028 remains feasible, but a more rational over/under date for NASA is probably somewhere in the vicinity of 2030. SpaceX is building the lunar lander for the Artemis III mission, a modified version of Starship. There is so much we don't really know yet about this vehicle. For example, how many refuelings will it take to load a Starship with sufficient propellant to land on the Moon and take off? What will the vehicle's controls look like, and will the landings be automated?\n\nAnd here's another one: How many people at SpaceX are actually working on the lunar version of Starship? Publicly, Musk has said he doesn't worry too much about China beating the United States back to the Moon. \"I think the United States should be aiming for Mars, because we've already actually been to the Moon several times,\" Musk said in an interview in late May. \"Yeah, if China sort of equals that, I'm like, OK, sure, but that's something that America did 56 years ago.\" Privately, Musk is highly critical of Artemis, saying NASA should focus on Mars. Certainly, that's the long arc of history toward which SpaceX's efforts are being bent. Although both the Moon and Mars versions of Starship require the vehicle to reach orbit and successfully refuel, there is a huge divergence in the technology and work required after that point. It's not at all clear that the Trump administration is seriously seeking to address this issue by providing SpaceX with carrots and sticks to move the lunar lander program forward. If Artemis is not a priority for Musk, how can it be for SpaceX? This all creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty ahead of Sunday's Starship launch.

      "text": "On Tuesday afternoon, just a few hours before a launch attempt of the ninth flight test of SpaceX's Starship vehicle, Elon Musk spoke with Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger to talk about where his space company goes from here.\nIn recent weeks, Musk has dialed back his focus on politics and said he wants to devote the majority of his time to SpaceX and his other companies. So what does that mean?\nThe conversation came just ahead of the opening of Starship's launch window, at 6:30 pm CT (23:30 UTC) in South Texas. Here is a lightly edited transcript of the interview.\nArs Technica: So what does success look like for you with today's launch?\nElon Musk: These launches are all about data. The most important thing is data on how to improve the tile design, so it's basically data during the high heating, re-entry phase in order to improve the tiles for the next iteration. So we've got like a dozen or more tile experiments. We're trying different coatings on tiles. We're trying different fabrication techniques, different attachment techniques. We're varying the gap filler for the tiles. And also, we want to make sure that we've solved the issues that caused the explosions in the last two flights in the upper stage engine bay.\nArs: Do you feel like you've solved that?\nMusk: I feel like we've got an 80 to\u2014I don't want to tempt fate, I was going to say 90\u2014but we've got about an 80 percent chance of having solved those issues. To really have a 100 percent chance, it requires the design iteration on the engine. And part of it was that we had to discover that we needed to tighten the bolts that attached the thrust chamber to the injector head after firing. So after the first firing, it turns out that's what caused some of the bolts to loosen a little bit; like some of them, some of the time, would loosen and that would allow basically fuel and gas to combine. Because the seal that normally blocks the passage of the fuel and oxidizer would gap a little bit, and it only takes a tiny amount of fuel and oxygen combining in a bad spot to explode the engine."

      "text": "SpaceX's next Starship rocket exploded during a ground test in South Texas late Wednesday, dealing another blow to a program already struggling to overcome three consecutive failures in recent months.\nThe late-night explosion at SpaceX's rocket development complex in Starbase, Texas, destroyed the bullet-shaped upper stage that was slated to launch on the next Starship test flight. The powerful blast set off fires around SpaceX's Massey's Test Site, located a few miles from the company's Starship factory and launch pads.\nLive streaming video from NASASpaceflight.com and LabPadre media organizations with cameras positioned around Starbase showed the 15-story-tall rocket burst into flames shortly after 11:00 pm local time (12:00 am EDT; 04:00 UTC). Local residents as far as 30 miles away reported seeing and feeling the blast.\nSpaceX confirmed the Starship, numbered Ship 36 in the company's inventory, \"experienced a major anomaly\" on a test stand as the vehicle prepared to ignite its six Raptor engines for a static fire test. These hold-down test-firings are typically one of the final milestones in a Starship launch campaign before SpaceX moves the rocket to the launch pad.\nThe explosion occurred as SpaceX finished loading super-cold methane and liquid oxygen propellants into Starship in preparation for the static fire test. The company said the area around the test site was evacuated of all personnel, and everyone was safe and accounted for after the incident. Firefighters from the Brownsville Fire Department were dispatched to the scene.\n\"Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials,\" SpaceX posted on X. \"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing operations continue.\"\nIn a separate post on X, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote that preliminary data suggests a high-pressure nitrogen tank failed inside Starship's payload bay. Many rockets have such tanks, or composite overwrapped pressure vessels, containing high-pressure gases used for purging and pressurizing different compartments inside the vehicle. These tanks, or COPVs, can be finicky. SpaceX engineers blamed hardware associated with COPVs for the only two catastrophic failures of the Falcon 9 rocket in 2015 and 2016."

On Thursday, just days later, the US Senate shot back with its own budget priorities for the space agency.\nThe US budget process is complicated and somewhat broken in recent years, as Congress has failed to pass a budget on time. So, we are probably at least several months away from seeing a final fiscal year 2026 budget from Congress. But we got our first glimpse of the Senate's thinking when the chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released his \"legislative directives\" for NASA on Thursday.\nThese specific directives concern \"reconciliation\" for the current budget year, which are supplemental appropriations for NASA and other federal agencies under the purview of Cruz's committee. And this committee does not actually write the budget; that's left to appropriations committees in the House and Senate.\nSenate space priorities\nHowever, Cruz is one of the most important voices in the US Senate on space policy, and the directives released Thursday indicate where he intends to line up on NASA during the upcoming budget fights.\nHere is how his budget ideas align with the White House priorities in three key areas:\n- Science: The Trump White House budget sought to significantly cut the space agency's science budget, from $7.33 billion to $3.91 billion, including the cancellation of some major missions. Cruz makes no comment on most of the science budget, but in calling for a Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, he is signaling support for a Mars Sample Return Mission.\n- Lunar Gateway: The Trump administration called for the cancellation of a small space station to be built in an elongated lunar orbit. There is very uneven support for this in the space community, but it is being led at Johnson Space Center, in Cruz's home state. Cruz says Congress should \"fully fund\" the Gateway as \"critical\" infrastructure.\n- Space Launch System and Orion: The Trump administration sought to cancel the large, expensive rocket and spacecraft after Artemis III, the first lunar landing. Cruz calls for additional funding for at least Artemis IV and Artemis V."

      "text": "In recent weeks, the secretive Chinese space program has reported some significant milestones in developing its program to land astronauts on the lunar surface by the year 2030.\nOn August 6, the China Manned Space Agency successfully tested a high-fidelity mockup of its 26-ton \"Lanyue\" lunar lander. The test, conducted outside of Beijing, used giant tethers to simulate lunar gravity as the vehicle fired main engines and fine control thrusters to land on a cratered surface and take off from there.\n\"The test,\" said the agency in an official statement, \"represents a key step in the development of China's manned lunar exploration program, and also marks the first time that China has carried out a test of extraterrestrial landing and takeoff capabilities of a manned spacecraft.\"\nAs part of the statement, the space agency reconfirmed that it plans to land its astronauts on the Moon \"before\" 2030.\nThen, last Friday, the space agency and its state-operated rocket developer, the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, successfully conducted a 30-second test firing of the Long March 10 rocket's center core with its seven YF-100K engines that burn kerosene and liquid oxygen. The primary variant of the rocket will combine three of these cores to lift about 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit.\nThese successful efforts followed a launch escape system test of the new Mengzhou spacecraft in June. A version of this spacecraft is planned for lunar missions.\nOn track for 2030\nThus, China's space program is making demonstrable progress in all three of the major elements of its lunar program: the large rocket to launch a crew spacecraft, which will carry humans to lunar orbit, plus the lander that will take astronauts down to the surface and back. This work suggests that China is on course to land on the Moon before the end of this decade.\nFor the United States and its allies in space, there are reasons to be dismissive of this. For one, NASA landed humans on the Moon nearly six decades ago with the Apollo Program. Been there, done that."

  "argos_summary": "SpaceX\u2019s Starbase in South Texas has evolved from a modest launch pad to a massive 1\u2011million\u2011square\u2011foot Starfactory, erasing a small local community and sparking environmental concerns. The new facility aims to produce a Starship rocket a day, a goal that contrasts sharply with the program\u2019s recent string of upper\u2011stage failures and the company\u2019s ongoing political scrutiny. Musk and internal sources remain confident that design issues can be resolved, with a new Version\u202f3 Starship slated for later this year, but the setbacks have delayed critical milestones for Starlink deployment, lunar landings, and future Mars missions. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces budget debates over NASA\u2019s Artemis program, and China\u2019s rapid lunar progress adds pressure to the U.S. space agenda.",
