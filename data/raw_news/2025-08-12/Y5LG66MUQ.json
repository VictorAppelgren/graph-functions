  "title": "US, China extend tariff truce by 90 days, staving off surge in duties",
  "description": "President Donald Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days Monday, at least delaying once again a dangerous showdown between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
  "content": "The United States and China on Monday extended a tariff truce for another 90 days, staving off triple-digit duties on each other\u2019s goods as US retailers get ready to ramp up inventories ahead of the critical end-of-year holiday season.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he had signed an executive order suspending the imposition of higher tariffs until 12:01 a.m. EST on November 10, with all other elements of the truce to remain in place.\n\nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry issued a parallel pause on extra tariffs early on Tuesday, also postponing for 90 days the addition of US firms it had targeted in April to trade and investment restriction lists.\n\n\u201cThe United States continues to have discussions with the PRC to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship and our resulting national and economic security concerns,\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order stated, using the acronym for the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\n\u201cThrough these discussions, the PRC continues to take significant steps toward remedying non-reciprocal trade arrangements and addressing the concerns of the United States relating to economic and national security matters.\u201d\n\nThe tariff truce between Beijing and Washington had been due to expire on Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT). The extension until early November buys crucial time for the seasonal autumn surge of imports for the Christmas season, including electronics, apparel and toys at lower tariff rates.\n\nThe new order prevents US tariffs on Chinese goods from shooting up to 145%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods were set to hit 125% \u2013 rates that would have resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries. It locks in place \u2013 at least for now \u2013 a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, with Chinese duties on US imports at 10%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump told a news conference earlier on Monday, highlighting what he called his good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nChina said the extension was \u201ca measure to further implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state during their June 5 call,\u201d and would provide stability to the global economy.\n\nTrump told CNBC last week that the US and China were getting very close to a trade agreement and he would meet with Xi before the end of the year if a deal was struck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s positive news,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former senior US trade official who is now a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cCombined with some of the de-escalatory steps both the United States and China have taken in recent weeks, it demonstrated that both sides are trying to see if they can reach some kind of a deal that would lay the groundwork for a Xi-Trump meeting this fall.\u201d\n\nThe two sides in May announced a truce in their trade dispute after talks in Geneva, Switzerland, agreeing to a 90-day period to allow further talks. They met again in Stockholm, Sweden, in late July, and US negotiators returned to Washington with a recommendation that Trump extend the deadline.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the triple-digit import duties both sides slapped on each other\u2019s goods in the spring were untenable and had essentially imposed a trade embargo between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a Trump-style negotiation if it didn\u2019t go right down to the wire,\u201d said Kelly Ann Shaw, a senior White House trade official during Trump\u2019s first term and now with law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld.\n\nShe said Trump had likely pressed China for further concessions before agreeing to the extension. Trump pushed for additional concessions on Sunday, urging China to quadruple its soybean purchases, although analysts questioned the feasibility of any such deal. Trump did not repeat the demand on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe whole reason for the 90-day pause in the first place was to lay the groundwork for broader negotiations and there\u2019s been a lot of noise about everything from soybeans to export controls to excess capacity over the weekend,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nRyan Majerus, a former US trade official now with the King & Spalding law firm, said the news would give both sides more time to work through longstanding trade concerns.\n\n\u201cThis will undoubtedly lower anxiety on both sides as talks continue, and as the US and China work toward a framework deal in the fall,\u201d he said.\n\nImports from China early this year had surged to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs, but dropped steeply in June, Commerce Department data showed last week.\n\nThe US trade deficit with China tumbled by roughly a third in June to $9.5 billion, its narrowest since February 2004. Over five consecutive months of declines, the US trade gap with China has narrowed by $22.2 billion \u2013 a 70% reduction from a year earlier.\n\nWashington has also been pressing Beijing to stop buying Russian oil to pressure Moscow over its war in Ukraine, with Trump threatening to impose secondary tariffs on China.",
