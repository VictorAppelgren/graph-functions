  "description": "Gruden had first sued the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell in 2021, claiming that the NFL had deliberately leaked disparaging emails that the ex-football coach had written in a \u201cmalicious a\u2026",
  "content": "Jon Gruden came up with a big win in his ongoing legal battle with the NFL on Monday.\n\nThe Nevada Supreme Court ruled in Gruden\u2019s favor \u2013 a 5-2 decision \u2013 that his lawsuit against the league cannot be sent into arbitration, allowing the case to proceed in public.\n\nGruden had first sued the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell in 2021, claiming that the NFL had deliberately leaked disparaging emails that the ex-football coach had written in a \u201cmalicious and orchestrated campaign\u201d in order to \u201cdestroy the career and reputation\u201d of Gruden.\n\nThe seven-judge panel declared that the arbitration clause in the NFL\u2019s constitution \u201cis unconscionable and does not apply to Gruden as a former employee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NFL Constitution would allow Goodell, as Commissioner, to arbitrate disputes about his own conduct \u2014 exactly what is at issue here,\u201d the decision stated. \u201cThe ability of the stronger party to select a biased arbitrator is unconscionable, even if the stronger party may ultimately choose a neutral arbitrator.\u201d\n\nIt was later added that it was \u201cunconscionable\u201d that the NFL could change parts of its constitution \u201cat any time, and without notice,\u201d which included the arbitration clause.\n\nIn a statement to USA Today, Gruden\u2019s attorney, Adam Hosmer-Henner, said that they were \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the decision.\n\n\u201cThis victory further vindicates Coach Gruden\u2019s reputation, and it clears the way to swiftly bringing him full justice and holding the NFL accountable,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NFL has not publicly commented on the decision.\n\nThe decision did not make any determination about whether any of Gruden\u2019s claims were true.\n\nThe suit stems back to email leaks that came out while the NFL was investigating the Commanders\u2019 toxic workplace.\n\nThe leaked emails had included racist, misogynistic and anti-gay slurs and were sent by Gruden during his time as an ESPN analyst and sent to then-Commanders general manager Bruce Allen over the course of a seven-year period.\n\nWhen the emails leaked, Gruden had been the head coach of the Raiders and eventually resigned.\n\nA lower-level state court had initially rejected the NFL\u2019s attempt to dismiss the suit or force the two sides into a private arbitration, but the Nevada Supreme Court then ruled in the league\u2019s favor in May 2024 to dismiss the case, in a 2-1 decision.\n\nThe Nevada Supreme Court did grant a motion by Gruden\u2019s lawyers in October 2024 to have the case heard by the full court before ultimately ruling in his favor on Monday.",

      "text": "Jon Gruden gets key legal win vs. NFL in Nevada Supreme Court ruling\n- The Nevada Supreme Court ruled Jon Gruden's lawsuit against the league cannot be forced behind closed doors into arbitration.\n- Gruden's lawsuit alleges that the NFL deliberately leaked disparaging emails he wrote.\n- The court sided with the former Raiders coach and found that an arbitration clause in the NFL's Constitution is \"unconscionable.\"\nJon Gruden has picked up a crucial victory in his yearslong legal fight with the NFL.\nThe Nevada Supreme Court ruled Aug. 11 that Gruden's lawsuit against the league, which alleges that it deliberately leaked disparaging emails he wrote, cannot be forced behind closed doors into arbitration.\nIn a 5-2 decision, the court sided with the former Las Vegas Raiders coach and found that an arbitration clause in the NFL's Constitution is \"unconscionable\" because it would effectively allow commissioner Roger Goodell to arbitrate disputes over his own conduct.\n\"We're very pleased with the Nevada Supreme Court's decision, not just for Coach Gruden but for all employees facing an employer's unfair arbitration process,\" Gruden's attorney Adam Hosmer-Henner said in a statement. \"This victory further vindicates Coach Gruden's reputation, and it clears the way to swiftly bringing him full justice and holding the NFL accountable.\"\nAn NFL spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThe league's only remaining next step would be to appeal Monday's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. But it is unclear if the league intends to make such a move \u2212 and, if it did, whether the U.S. Supreme Court would agree to hear the case.\nThe Nevada Supreme Court's ruling comes nearly four years after Gruden's dramatic resignation as head coach of the Raiders, amid public outcry over emails he had written when he was working as an NFL analyst for ESPN between 2011 and 2018. The emails, which were obtained as part of an investigation into the then-Washington Football Team, were published by multiple news outlets and included misogynistic and homophobic language.\nGruden subsequently sued the NFL and Goodell in November 2021, alleging that they had deliberately leaked the emails to news outlets in a \"malicious and orchestrated campaign\" to destroy his career. The NFL has previously described those claims as \"baseless\" and said only Gruden is at fault for the contents of emails he wrote.\nMost of the legal battle in the years since has been not about the details of the case, but rather where it should be resolved. Gruden has argued that his lawsuit should proceed in public view, in a Nevada district court, because he was not a team or league employee at the time of the dispute. The NFL, meanwhile, has sought to push the case into private arbitration and cited a broad arbitration clause in its constitution, which all league employees must abide by.\nA district judge in Nevada initially ruled in Gruden's favor, but the NFL then successfully appealed the matter to a three-judge panel of the state's supreme court. Monday's ruling, and reversal, came after Gruden requested a rehearing before the full court.\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social."

The allegations were first reported in 2017 by German magazine Der Spiegel.\nUS District Judge Jennifer Dorsey dismissed the case with prejudice, due to misconduct by Mayorga\u2019s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, who used \u201cpurloined\u201d confidential documents.\nStovall was ordered to pay a proportion of Ronaldo\u2019s legal costs."
