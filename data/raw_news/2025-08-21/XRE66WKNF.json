  "content": "The SEC is moving closer to adopting a nine-game conference schedule, a source briefed on the discussions said, after the conference\u2019s athletic directors met this week in Birmingham, Ala.\n\nWhile the conference\u2019s presidents will still need to give final approval, it\u2019s the closest the conference has been to moving forward with a nine-game schedule \u2014 a decision it has been debating for years.\n\nThe SEC currently plays eight conference games, while the Big Ten and Big 12 play nine (the ACC also plays eight). In the spring, ESPN indicated a willingness to increase its payment to the SEC if the conference were to add a ninth league game, though there was no formal offer at the time.\n\nThe eight-or-nine debate comes amid the backdrop of another debate about the future format of the College Football Playoff. The SEC and Big Ten differed on preferred 16-game formats this summer, with the Big Ten pushing for a format that would include more automatic bids. Part of the reason for that was the inconsistent number of league games each conference plays.\n\nIn a nine-game conference schedule, every SEC team would have three annual opponents and six new opponents each season. At SEC media days in July, commissioner Greg Sankey said the three annual opponents would not be permanent. The schedules would operate on a four-year cycle, allowing for \u201clook-ins\u201d to revisit the three annual rivalries.\n\nThis story will be updated.",

      "text": "ESPN has indicated a willingness to increase its payment to the SEC if the conference adds a ninth game to its league football schedule, sources briefed on the matter told The Athletic.\nThere is no formal offer yet, those sources added, and the exact amount of the increase still needs to be fully negotiated. But the sources said the additional money would likely be in the range of $50-80 million annually on top of the current deal, in which ESPN pays the conference $811 million per year to broadcast its sporting events. Both ESPN and the SEC declined to comment.\nAdvertisement\nA change in ESPN\u2019s stance doesn\u2019t mean the SEC will definitely move to playing nine conference games. Now the main hurdle to expanding the league schedule may be the future College Football Playoff format, which isn\u2019t likely to be determined until at least June. That makes it less likely \u2014 though not impossible \u2014 that the SEC makes a decision on a schedule format at its spring meetings later this month in Destin, Fla.\nStill, ESPN\u2019s willingness to up its ante is an important development, as it has been one of the main sticking points among enough SEC members to resist the push for nine games. When the SEC announced the addition of Oklahoma and Texas in July 2021, momentum toward a nine-game schedule increased instantly, with commissioner Greg Sankey among those privately in favor. (Sankey finally went public with his preference earlier this year.)\nBut for the past four years, members have expressed enough opposition that the conference instead went with a temporary fix of eight-game football schedules for 2024 and \u201925, the first two seasons with Oklahoma and Texas. Some of the concern was competitive, especially among teams worried about reaching the six-win bowl eligibility threshold. Some of the concern was economic: A nine-game schedule means schools could play one fewer home game every two years, and they wanted ESPN to help make up the difference.\nOne reason Sankey and the SEC went with the temporary eight-game schedule was the hope that the success of the inaugural season with Oklahoma and Texas would encourage ESPN. And that appears to be exactly what happened.\nThe two new SEC schools were part of memorable, highly rated games, including their annual Red River rivalry and Texas\u2019 two losses to Georgia on national stages. The SEC championship game between the Bulldogs and Longhorns was the highest-rated non-Playoff game of the college football season, and at least one SEC team was involved in eight of the 10 most highly rated games of college football\u2019s regular season.\nAdvertisement\nAnother consideration for the league is the games that would not happen regularly if the SEC stayed with an eight-game schedule. The eight-game format would include only one permanent opponent for every team, so some highly rated rivalries would only be played twice every four years, including Texas-Texas A&M, Alabama-Tennessee, Alabama-LSU and Auburn-Georgia.\nIf the SEC went to a nine-game schedule, all those games would be played annually. Those matchups are all part of the 2024 and 2025 schedules, an unsubtle way for the SEC to show ESPN what it could be missing. (The eight-game schedule format could always be changed to account for those games, but the conference has made no move toward doing that.)\nAs for the CFP format, the SEC has been waiting to see whether the postseason field will expand to 14 or 16 teams and whether any automatic bids will be installed in the new format; the SEC and Big Ten have discussed pushing for as many as four bids apiece. When the SEC only got three teams in the 2024-25 Playoff field, concern over further snubs immediately boosted leaguewide sentiment about staying at eight games. The introduction of automatic bids may address those concerns, but momentum for their addition to the CFP structure may have stalled.\n\u201cOne of the issues in the room for our athletics directors is what seemed to matter most, is the number to the right, the number of losses, and how do we understand what that means for our schedule moving forward?\u201d Sankey said in March during an appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show. \u201cI\u2019m one who said I really think we ought to be trying to move towards a nine-game conference schedule. I think that can be positive for a lot of reasons. You watch the interest around conference games. But not if that causes us to lose opportunities.\u201d\nAnother factor in a potential move off of eight-game slates: The SEC has been working closely with the Big Ten, which plays a nine-game conference schedule, and the leagues\u2019 consideration of future scheduling partnerships may hinge on playing the same number of league opponents. The SEC could also just settle for a stronger assurance that schedule strength will matter to the CFP selection committee and assume the risk of an extra conference game in order to reap the financial benefits. The new money that would head each school\u2019s way from ESPN would likely not even account for half of the more than $20 million schools will be allowed to distribute to athletes under a new revenue sharing system starting this summer, but it would still help.\n(Photo: Eakin Howard / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti defended his proposal that his conference and the SEC should each receive four automatic bids to a 16-team College Football Playoff, but left room for other ideas, as part of a 30-minute conversation on Monday with Fox Sports\u2019 Joel Klatt.\nPetitti, who had not previously publicly discussed CFP expansion or slotting this spring or summer, said his focus for automatic qualifiers is to encourage teams to compete in more challenging regular-season games and \u201creduce the role of the committee.\u201d Petitti\u2019s preferred plan would allow for two automatic qualifiers for both the ACC and the Big 12, plus one spot for the highest-ranked champion outside of the Power 4 conferences and three at-large teams.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe alternative to this system is expanding the field and giving the committee more to do,\u201d Petitti told Klatt. \u201cIf you go to 16 and you have 11 at-large, you\u2019ve just added even more decision-making. The answer is, well, at that point, it gets to be easy, because you\u2019ll cover everybody. No, because the more spots you put into the system, the more difficult decisions you\u2019re facing.\n\u201cTeams start to look more alike, as we all have a tough road loss. Some of them may have stumbled at home in a tough conference game. The sequencing of when you play, you might be at a really difficult place, and then have to go on back home and play somebody else or be on the road for two weeks. That journey is really relevant. So, I think you make it harder.\u201d\nOne year into a 12-team College Football Playoff, the tournament seems likely to expand to 16 teams for the 2026-27 season. The Big Ten and SEC have the control to reshape the upcoming system, which was granted by other conferences through a memorandum of understanding last year.\nThe Big Ten and SEC trended toward approving what\u2019s called the 4+4+2+2+1 plan, until conference meetings in May. Officials and coaches from the ACC, Big 12 and SEC touted a plan for five conference champions and 11 at-large teams in a 16-team field. It was the first time the SEC and Big Ten appeared on opposite sides of constructing a new CFP model. The CFP must inform ESPN/ABC by Dec. 1 whether it plans to stay at 12 teams beginning in 2026 or expand.\nWith significant differences in scheduling \u2014 the Big Ten and Big 12 have nine league games, the SEC and ACC each play eight \u2014 and little crossover in nonconference games, Petitti wants each conference to determine which teams qualify for the CFP. That\u2019s why he wants to set up three CFP play-in games. In the Big Ten, both championship participants would qualify, as would the winner of games between No. 3 and No. 6 and between No. 4 and No. 5. Last year, the play-in games would have involved Iowa at Indiana and Illinois at Ohio State.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt just is a way to also normalize your conference schedule, because it really is hard to sometimes tell the difference among our own teams,\u201d Petitti said. \u201cA lot of times they don\u2019t play each other.\n\u201cLook at Ohio State last year. Ohio State lost two Big Ten conference games. Technically, they finished fourth in the conference at 7-2. By the end of the playoff run, they were clearly the best team in the country. So, I think it\u2019s an indication of, it\u2019s hard to figure this stuff out during the course of the season.\u201d\nIf conferences choose their own CFP qualifiers, Petitti said leagues will set up better nonconference matchups among the power conferences.\n\u201cThe goal is to play more nonconference games, because if you\u2019re qualifying for the CFP off your conference record, and then a play-in game, the fact that you play a tough SEC or ACC or Big 12 team and maybe get beat on the road, or whatever the result is, that might impact your seeding down the road, but it\u2019s not going to impact your access,\u201d Petitti said. \u201cThere\u2019s three at-larges, so yeah, it does a little bit. But at the end of the day, that loss isn\u2019t fatal.\u201d\nPetitti\u2019s sit-down interview with Klatt took place on a Fox platform. Fox owns 61 percent of the Big Ten Network and is the league\u2019s tier-1 rights holder for football.\n(Photo: Melissa Tamez / Imagn Images)"

  "argos_summary": "The SEC is nearing a decision to shift from an eight\u2011game to a nine\u2011game conference schedule, a move that would align it with the Big Ten and Big 12 and potentially increase ESPN\u2019s annual payout by $50\u2011$80 million. The change is tied to broader discussions about the College Football Playoff format, with the SEC and Big Ten debating automatic bids and a possible 16\u2011team field. While ESPN\u2019s willingness to boost payments has eased financial concerns, the conference still faces resistance from member schools worried about competitive balance and bowl eligibility. The final approval will require conference presidents\u2019 consent, and the outcome may hinge on the CFP\u2019s structure, which is expected to be decided by June.",
