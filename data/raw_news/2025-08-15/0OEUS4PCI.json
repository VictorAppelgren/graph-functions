  "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Very different commemorations were held Friday for the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, a conflict that laid the foundation for today\u2019s Asian geopolitics and ongoing tensions.\n\nTokyo was torn between remorse and remembrance. Seoul focused its messaging toward North Korea, with no mention of its liberators, the wartime Allies. Pyongyang\u2019s key message was its renewed relationship with Russia, whose troops liberated the north of the peninsula in 1945.\n\nEmperor Hirohito announced Japan\u2019s unconditional surrender via radio on Aug. 15, 1945. On Sept. 2, surrender documents were signed aboard the American battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.\n\nChina commemorates the war the day after the signing, and President Xi Jinping is expected to preside over a massive parade in Beijing on Sept. 3.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who hails from the left wing of the broadly conservative Liberal Democratic Party, sounded an elegiac note.\n\n\u201cWe must never again repeat the horrors of war. We must never again lose our way,\u201d said Mr. Ishiba, who was joined by Emperor Naruhito. \u201cWe must now take deeply into our hearts once again our remorse and also the lessons learned from that war.\u201d\n\nThe venue was Tokyo\u2019s Nippon Budokan Hall, an arena designed for martial arts competitions but also used as a concert venue.\n\nMr. Ishiba\u2019s future hangs by a thread. Since taking power in October 2024, he has lost the LDP\u2019s majority in both houses of the Diet.\n\nThere are widespread rumors that he will be ousted from within the party.\n\nSome lawmakers took a more controversial approach to the 80th anniversary of the end of the war. More than 100, from multiple parties, visited Tokyo\u2019s Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrines Japan\u2019s 2.5 million war dead.\n\nHowever, the enshrinement of war criminals, as well as the shrine\u2019s take on the Pacific War \u2014 that Tokyo\u2019s war aim was to eject White colonialists from East Asia, rather than simply embarking upon a brutal regional rampage \u2014 has made politicians\u2019 visits to the shrine controversial, especially in China and South Korea.\n\nAmong LDP dignitaries visiting Yasukuni was Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, son of a former premier and widely suggested as a possible replacement for Mr. Ishiba.\n\nThe Japanese are divided over the war. Some are remorseful for the country\u2019s aggression and brutalities, while some say Japan was also a victim and has apologized enough.\n\nTokyo-based U.S. academic Jeffrey Hall noted on X that a viral tweet with more than 5.7 million views accused Mr. Ishiba of being an \u201canti-Japanese\u201d leftist because he didn\u2019t visit Yasukuni.\n\nMr. Naruhito also skipped Yasukuni. No emperor has visited the site since the war criminals were controversially enshrined there in 1978.\n\nIn the lead-up to the ceremonies, the emperor had been visiting sites emblematic of Japanese trauma in the war\u2019s final months: The islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, which were sites of merciless battles, and the city of Hiroshima, victim of history\u2019s first atomic bombing.\n\nSpeaking in central Seoul\u2019s Sejong Center for the Performing Arts, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung was conciliatory toward Japan, which colonized Korea from 1910-1945.\n\n\u201cWe will seek forward-looking, mutually beneficial cooperation with Japan while holding frequent meetings,\u201d he said.\n\nPer Aug. 15 tradition, he also praised Koreans who fought for independence and \u201cvowed to honor and respect\u201d their memory.\n\nHowever, he made no mention of the wartime allies who defeated Japan and thereby freed Korea.\n\nFor years, Anglo-Indian forces in Southeast Asia, Chinese forces in China and U.S. forces across the Pacific battled Imperial Japan. In the war\u2019s final week, Soviet forces stormed into Manchuria, Korea and Japan\u2019s northern islands.\n\n\u201cThere was more than one factor that brought liberty to the people of Korea,\u201d said Park Dong-suk, who holds a doctorate in Korean-Japanese history. He cited local independence activism, Nationalist Chinese support and the Allies\u2019 battlefield defeats of Japan.\n\n\u201cKoreans in China were working in collaboration with [CIA predecessor] OSS to retake Korea, but the atomic bombs and Soviet entry into the war alleviated the need for trained Koreans to fight,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lee also stated his ambition to improve relations with North Korea, starting with \u201crestored trust and improved dialogue.\u201d\n\nHe said he would respect the North\u2019s political system and would take proactive military moves to reduce tensions.\n\nHis latest move at rapprochement \u2014 removing propaganda broadcasting gear from the DMZ \u2014 has not been reciprocated by Pyongyang.\n\nThere, dictator Kim Jong-un focused his Aug. 15 message on his country\u2019s revitalized relationship with Russia.\n\nSoviet troops liberated northern Korea and placed Mr. Kim\u2019s late grandfather, Kim Il-sung, an anti-Japanese guerrilla, as head of state. Moscow-Pyongyang relations degraded after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but with the two capitals now allied in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, their partnership has been restored.\n\nSpeaking at Pyongyang\u2019s Arch de Triumph, Mr. Kim said, per state media, \u201cThe unity and comradeship forged at the cost of blood in the struggle for the common cause are fully displayed in the battlefield of the 21st century to frustrate the imperialists\u2019 outrageous arbitrary practices \u2026 are developing into a powerful alliance.\u201d\n\nHe made no mention of the United States.\n\nThe legacies of 1945 live on across the region.\n\nWith the last-minute Soviet assault, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel. The Soviets took Korea\u2019s north. The Americans occupied the south weeks later, creating a national division that persists to this day.\n\nHeavy combat against Japan depleted Chinese Nationalist forces, who were defeated after 1945 by Chinese Communist forces. Nationalists retreated to Taiwan, where cross-strait tensions continue to simmer.\n\nThough eventually defeated, Japan\u2019s 1941-42 victories over Western imperial powers in Southeast Asia inspired post-1945 overthrows of European colonialism in South and Southeast Asia.\n\nArguably the biggest change from 1945 is Japan-U.S. relations. Despite trade tensions, the two are strategic allies. Historic ironies, however, live on.\n\nWith U.S. backing, Tokyo is rearming. Its largest vessel, the F35B light carrier Kaga, bears the same name as a forebear that joined the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, then was sunk by the U.S. Navy at the battle of Midway.",

  "argos_summary": "The 80th anniversary of World War\u202fII\u2019s end saw divergent commemorations across East Asia: Tokyo held a solemn ceremony with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Emperor Naruhito, while Seoul\u2019s President Lee Jae\u2011myung focused on reconciliation with Japan and future talks with North Korea, and Pyongyang\u2019s Kim Jong\u2011un highlighted renewed ties with Russia. In Tokyo, visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine by LDP figures and the emperor\u2019s absence underscored ongoing domestic divisions over Japan\u2019s wartime legacy. Beijing\u2019s massive parade under President Xi Jinping and China\u2019s own remembrance on September\u202f3 reflected its broader narrative of liberation. The events collectively reminded observers that the 1945 war still shapes regional geopolitics, from Korea\u2019s division to China\u2019s civil war aftermath and Japan\u2019s evolving security posture with the United States.",
