  "description": "Holiday home rental firm files for bankruptcy amid lawsuits over American dreams turned nightmares.",
  "content": "Traveling is wonderful, but being a part of it as a business owner has its challenges. Travel and tourism are very complex, and as such, they\u2019re hard to navigate, both for travelers and service providers.\n\nThe travel industry fully recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, reaching post-pandemic travel numbers in 2024. However, pandemic-like crises and lockdowns are not the only challenges disrupting such a large industry.\n\nAccording to Hospitality Management, the main challenges the travel industry faces include:\n\nOne major part of the travel industry is the vacation rental sector, which has risen in popularity over the last decade, mostly thanks to popular home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb.\n\nTravelers are attracted to these properties because they are more affordable than hotels, suitable for families with children and pets, and provide more comfort and privacy. As many as 64% of travelers prefer vacation rentals over hotels, writes Grand View Research, citing data from TurnKey Vacation Rentals' 2019 poll.\n\nThe US vacation rental market accounted for a 19.6% share of the global vacation rental market revenue in 2023.\n\nHowever, not everyone is able to survive running business legally in such a huge industry full of many challenges.\n\nPopular vacation rental company based in central Florida, IPG Franchising, was investigated for months by Gulf Coast News and is facing multiple lawsuits.\n\nIPG Franchising was attracting investors who wanted to acquire a contract to manage vacation rentals. It was also offering property management franchises designed to help individuals from countries with an investment treaty with the US obtain an E-2 Visa.\n\nThe E-2 investor visa enables individuals to enter and work in the US based on an investment in a US business. It is valid for three months to five years, depending on the country of origin, but can be extended indefinitely.\n\nMany property owners, renters, and investors said IPG Franchising owes them money, reports Gulf Coast News. One owner says he\u2019s missing $23,000, while one renter claims a loss of $12,000 deposit.\n\nJane Sonkin told the outlet how she moved her family from Canada to Florida in 2022 to start their own business after investing in IPG Franchising. While initially the family received payments, now it\u2019s been months since they received any payment.\n\nSonkin estimates they are out more than $200,000.\n\n\u201cIt's a huge amount of money. It's our life savings. It's money that was taken away from my children,\u201d Sonkin said. \u201cThere's no property anymore. There's no communication. We are left with nothing.\"\n\nConsidering the recent scrutiny and lawsuits that followed, the question that comes to mind is what happened with overseas investors who acquired their E-2 Visas through IPG Franchising.\n\nIPG Franchising has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing more than 80 creditors in the filing, not including some who have told the outlet they are also owed money.\n\nAccording to the filing, the company has less than $50,000 in estimated assets and between $1 million and $10 million in liabilities. Its website is also down.\n\nIt appears that the controversy runs even deeper as Gulf Coast News reveals the people behind IPG Franchising, Graham and Jamie Greene, managed more companies.\n\nOne of those companies, Island Attitude, which managed vacation rentals in the Manasota Key area, is said to owe money to property owners and those who paid to rent.\n\nPreviously, attorneys representing IPG Franchising defended the company, arguing its financial troubles stem from the pandemic and hurricanes.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the vacation rental company?\n\nUnlike Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which results in liquidation and final closure, Chapter 11 gives businesses more options. It enables them to reorganize its financial affairs in a process where a debtor can continue to operate their business while developing a plan to repay creditors.\n\nFurthermore, when a business files for chapter 11 bankruptcy an automatic stay goes into effect under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 which means that all ongoing lawsuits, collections, and other actions against the company are halted until the stay is lifted.\n\nGiven the lawsuits and the reported debts, it appears highly unlikely that IPG Franchising will recover from bankruptcy.",

      "text": "The tourism industry is a major driver of global economic growth, creating jobs, fostering cultural exchange, and fueling local economies. However, this fast-evolving sector also faces significant challenges, from adapting to changing consumer trends to managing the impact of natural disasters. These obstacles affect tourism companies, travel businesses, and host communities worldwide. In this article, we explore the biggest challenges in the tourism and hospitality sector\u2014and strategies to overcome them.\nTop 5 Challenges for the Tourism Sector in 2025\nAs recruitment specialists, we at Hospitality Management Jobs have seen firsthand the challenges facing the tourism sector in 2025. From staffing shortages to evolving customer expectations, these hurdles directly impact hospitality jobs and business operations. Below, we share the top challenges shaping the industry and offer insights to navigate this competitive landscape effectively.\n1. Recovering From Pre-Pandemic Levels\nOne of the most pressing challenges in the travel industry is recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. International tourist arrivals have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels in many popular destinations. For tourism businesses, the slow rebound has meant reduced revenue, ongoing operational costs, and increased competition for potential customers. Travel companies must focus on rebuilding consumer confidence, offering seamless travel experiences, and promoting safety measures to encourage international travel.\n2. Rising Cost of Living and Operational Costs\nAnother significant hurdle is the rising cost of living, which impacts both tourists and travel businesses. For international tourists, the higher cost of flights, accommodations, and experiences limits their ability to explore destinations. Tourism companies and the broader hospitality sector face increasing labor costs, higher operational expenses, and the need to offer competitive pricing while maintaining profitability. Balancing affordability with quality remains a key challenge for the tourism sector.\n3. Managing Natural Disasters and Climate Action\nNatural disasters have become a frequent concern for tourism destinations worldwide. Hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and other disasters not only endanger the lives of residents and tourists but also damage critical infrastructure. National parks and adventure travel hotspots are particularly vulnerable. The tourism industry must prioritize sustainable tourism practices and climate action to mitigate the long-term impact of these events. Developing strategies for resilience and recovery is essential for maintaining tourism competitiveness in the face of these challenges.\n4. Political Unrest and Safety Concerns\nPolitical unrest and safety concerns can deter international tourism, even in historically popular destinations. Countries experiencing instability often see a decline in international tourist arrivals, affecting their economic growth. Travel brands must address safety concerns in their marketing strategies and provide clear communication to reassure potential customers. Collaborating with local community partners can help create safe and welcoming environments for tourists.\n5. Evolving Consumer Behaviours and Expectations\nConsumer behaviors are constantly changing, creating new challenges for tourism companies. Today\u2019s travelers demand personalized experiences, seamless travel, and sustainable choices. Tourism businesses must leverage advanced technologies and digital platforms to deliver tailored offerings that cater to these expectations. Additionally, consumer behaviors now prioritize experiences over material goods, which places greater emphasis on creating memorable tourism activities.\nWork with hospitality experts to overcome industry challenges\nExpert Tips to Overcome Tourism Challenges and Sustain a Thriving Hospitality Industry\nNavigating tourism challenges requires strategic solutions to ensure a thriving hospitality industry. As recruitment specialists in hospitality management, we\u2019ve gathered expert tips to tackle key obstacles, from workforce shortages to changing guest demands. Discover actionable insights to overcome these challenges and sustain growth in this dynamic, ever-evolving sector.\nPromote Sustainable Tourism Practices\nSustainable tourism is no longer optional; it is a necessity. With the rise of mass travel, popular destinations are grappling with issues like overcrowding, environmental degradation, and strained host communities. Tourism management must focus on promoting sustainable choices, such as eco-friendly accommodations and low-impact tourism activities. Travel marketing efforts should highlight sustainable options to attract environmentally conscious international tourists.\nEnsure Inclusive Growth\nInclusive growth within the tourism sector is vital for ensuring that the benefits of tourism are distributed equitably. Tourism & hospitality companies must work with community partners to create opportunities for underrepresented groups and invest in the development of local economies. By fostering inclusivity, the travel industry can strengthen its connection with host communities and build long-term resilience.\nAdapt to Digital Transformation\nThe shift toward digital technology has revolutionized the tourism industry. Travel businesses must invest in user-friendly websites, mobile apps, and digital marketing strategies to engage potential customers effectively. Additionally, the use of big data and analytics is essential for understanding consumer behaviors and predicting future trends. Adapting to these changes requires ongoing investment and a willingness to embrace innovation.\nBalancing Tourism Growth With Community Impact\nMass travel can lead to overcrowding, environmental strain, and tension within host communities. Striking a balance between tourism growth and community well-being is crucial. Travel companies should collaborate with local stakeholders to implement measures that protect cultural heritage, reduce environmental impact, and ensure that the benefits of tourism extend to all members of the community.\nMeeting Customer Expectations for Seamless Travel\nModern travelers expect a seamless travel experience, from booking flights to exploring their chosen destination. Tourism companies must invest in advanced technologies, such as AI-driven customer support and real-time travel updates, to meet these expectations. Ensuring a frictionless journey for international tourists can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nTop 5 hospitality recruitment strategies\nThe Importance of Your Workforce in Overcoming Tourism Industry Challenges\nThe workforce is crucial in overcoming the tourism sector\u2019s challenges, with key roles like hotel managers, food and beverage directors, and front-line staff ensuring smooth operations. These professionals are the backbone of the hospitality industry, driving excellence in guest experiences and maintaining high service standards. Their leadership, expertise, and dedication help businesses adapt to changing demands, overcome staffing shortages, and keep the tourism sector thriving despite ongoing challenges.\nHow to Find the Best Tourism and Hospitality Employees\n- Partner with Hospitality Recruitment Specialists: Collaborate with recruitment experts who specialize in hospitality roles.

      "text": "11 U.S. Code \u00a7 362 - Automatic stay\nPub. L. 119\u201327, \u00a7\u00a7 11(c), 20, July 18, 2025, 139 Stat. 457, 466, provided that, effective on the earlier of the date that is 18 months after July 18, 2025, or the date that is 120 days after the date on which the primary Federal payment stablecoin regulators issue any final regulations implementing Pub. L. 119\u201327, this section is amended as follows:\n(1) in subsection (a), in paragraph (7), by striking \u201cand\u201d; in paragraph (8), by striking the period and inserting \u201c; and\u201d; and by adding at the end the following:\n\u201c(9) the redemption of payment stablecoins issued by the permitted payment stablecoin issuer, from payment stablecoin reserves required to be maintained under section 4 of the GENIUS Act.\u201d; and\n(2) in subsection (d), in paragraph (3)(B)(ii), by striking \u201cor\u201d at the end; in paragraph (4)(B), by striking the period at the end and inserting \u201c; or\u201d; and by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n\u201c(5) with respect to the redemption of payment stablecoins held by a person, if the court finds, subject to the motion and attestation of the permitted payment stablecoin issuer, which shall be filed on the petition date or as soon as practicable thereafter, there are payment stablecoin reserves available for distribution on a ratable basis to similarly situated payment stablecoin holders, provided that the court shall use best efforts to enter a final order to begin distributions under this paragraph not later than 14 days after the date of the required hearing.\u201d\nSee 2025 Amendment notes below.\nSection 362(a)(1) of the House amendment adopts the provision contained in the Senate amendment enjoining the commencement or continuation of a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case. The provision is beneficial and interacts with section 362(a)(6), which also covers assessment, to prevent harassment of the debtor with respect to pre-petition claims.\nSection 362(a)(7) contains a provision contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House. The differing provision in the Senate amendment was rejected. It is not possible that a debt owing to the debtor may be offset against an interest in the debtor.\nSection 362(a)(8) is new. The provision stays the commencement or continuation of any proceeding concerning the debtor before the U.S. Tax Court.\nSection 362(b)(4) indicates that the stay under section 362(a)(1) does not apply to affect the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce the governmental unit\u2019s police or regulatory power. This section is intended to be given a narrow construction in order to permit governmental units to pursue actions to protect the public health and safety and not to apply to actions by a governmental unit to protect a pecuniary interest in property of the debtor or property of the estate.\nSection 362(b)(6) of the House amendment adopts a provision contained in the Senate amendment restricting the exception to the automatic stay with respect to setoffs to permit only the setoff of mutual debts and claims. Traditionally, the right of setoff has been limited to mutual debts and claims and the lack of the clarifying term \u201cmutual\u201d in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House created an unintentional ambiguity. Section 362(b)(7) of the House amendment permits the issuance of a notice of tax deficiency. The House amendment rejects section 362(b)(7) in the Senate amendment. It would have permitted a particular governmental unit to obtain a pecuniary advantage without a hearing on the merits contrary to the exceptions contained in sections 362(b)(4) and (5).\nSection 362(d) of the House amendment represents a compromise between comparable provisions in the House bill and Senate amendment. Under section 362(d)(1) of the House amendment, the court may terminate, annul, modify, or condition the automatic stay for cause, including lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of a secured party. It is anticipated that the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure will provide that those hearings will receive priority on the calendar. Under section 362(d)(2) the court may alternatively terminate, annul, modify, or condition the automatic stay for cause including inadequate protection for the creditor. The court shall grant relief from the stay if there is no equity and it is not necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor.\nThe latter requirement is contained in section 362(d)(2). This section is intended to solve the problem of real property mortgage foreclosures of property where the bankruptcy petition is filed on the eve of foreclosure. The section is not intended to apply if the business of the debtor is managing or leasing real property, such as a hotel operation, even though the debtor has no equity if the property is necessary to an effective reorganization of the debtor. Similarly, if the debtor does have an equity in the property, there is no requirement that the property be sold under section 363 of title 11 as would have been required by the Senate amendment.\nSection 362(e) of the House amendment represents a modification of provisions in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House and the Senate amendment to make clear that a final hearing must be commenced within 30 days after a preliminary hearing is held to determine whether a creditor will be entitled to relief from the automatic stay. In order to insure that those hearings will in fact occur within such 30-day period, it is anticipated that the rules of bankruptcy procedure provide that such final hearings receive priority on the court calendar.\nSection 362(g) places the burden of proof on the issue of the debtor\u2019s equity in collateral on the party requesting relief from the automatic stay and the burden on other issues on the debtor.\nAn amendment has been made to section 362(b) to permit the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to commence an action to foreclose a mortgage or deed of trust. The commencement of such an action is necessary for tax purposes. The section is not intended to permit the continuation of such an action after it is commenced nor is the section to be construed to entitle the Secretary to take possession in lieu of foreclosure.\nAutomatic stay: Sections 362(b)(8) and (9) contained in the Senate amendment are largely deleted in the House amendment. Those provisions add to the list of actions not stayed (a) jeopardy assessments, (b) other assessments, and (c) the issuance of deficiency notices. In the House amendment, jeopardy assessments against property which ceases to be property of the estate is already authorized by section 362(c)(1). Other assessments are specifically stayed under section 362(a)(6), while the issuance of a deficiency notice is specifically permitted. Stay of the assessment and the permission to issue a statutory notice of a tax deficiency will permit the debtor to take his personal tax case to the Tax Court, if the bankruptcy judge authorizes him to do so (as explained more fully in the discussion of section 505).\nThe automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws. It gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors. It stops all collection efforts, all harassment, and all foreclosure actions. It permits the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan, or simply to be relieved of the financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy.\nThe action commenced by the party seeking relief from the stay is referred to as a motion to make it clear that at the expedited hearing under subsection (e), and at hearings on relief from the stay, the only issue will be the lack of adequate protection, the debtor\u2019s equity in the property, and the necessity of the property to an effective reorganization of the debtor, or the existence of other cause for relief from the stay. This hearing will not be the appropriate time at which to bring in other issues, such as counterclaims against the creditor, which, although relevant to the question of the amount of the debt, concern largely collateral or unrelated matters. This approach is consistent with that taken in cases such as In re Essex Properties, Ltd., 430 F.Supp. 1112 (N.D.Cal.1977), that an action seeking relief from the stay is not the assertion of a claim which would give rise to the right or obligation to assert counterclaims. Those counterclaims are not to be handled in the summary fashion that the preliminary hearing under this provision will be. Rather, they will be the subject of more complete proceedings by the trustee to recover property of the estate or to object to the allowance of a claim. However, this would not preclude the party seeking continuance of the stay from presenting evidence on the existence of claims which the court may consider in exercising its discretion. What is precluded is a determination of such collateral claims on the merits at the hearing.\nParagraph (7) [of subsec. (a)] stays setoffs of mutual debts and credits between the debtor and creditors. As with all other paragraphs of subsection (a), this paragraph does not affect the right of creditors. It simply stays its enforcement pending an orderly examination of the debtor\u2019s and creditors\u2019 rights.\nSubsection (c) governs automatic termination of the stay. Subsections (d) through (g) govern termination of the stay by the court on the request of a party in interest. Subsection (d) requires the court, on request of a party in interest, to grant relief from the stay, such as by terminating, annulling, modifying, or conditioning the stay, for cause. The lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of the party requesting relief from the stay is one cause for relief, but is not the only cause. As noted above, a desire to permit an action to proceed to completion in another tribunal may provide another cause. Other causes might include the lack of any connection with or interference with the pending bankruptcy case. For example, a divorce or child custody proceeding involving the debtor may bear no relation to the bankruptcy case. In that case, it should not be stayed. A probate proceeding in which the debtor is the executor or administrator of another\u2019s estate usually will not be related to the bankruptcy case, and should not be stayed. Generally, proceedings in which the debtor is a fiduciary, or involving postpetition activities of the debtor, need not be stayed because they bear no relationship to the purpose of the automatic stay, which is debtor protection from his creditors. The facts of each request will determine whether relief is appropriate under the circumstances.\nSubsection (e) provides a protection for secured creditors that is not available under present law. The subsection sets a time certain within which the bankruptcy court must rule on the adequacy of protection provided of the secured creditor\u2019s interest. If the court does not rule within 30 days from a request for relief from the stay, the stay is automatically terminated with respect to the property in question. In order to accommodate more complex cases, the subsection permits the court to make a preliminary ruling after a preliminary hearing. After a preliminary hearing, the court may continue the stay only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the party opposing relief from the stay will prevail at the final hearing. Because the stay is essentially an injunction, the three stages of the stay may be analogized to the three stages of an injunction. The filing of the petition which gives rise to the automatic stay is similar to a temporary restraining order. The preliminary hearing is similar to the hearing on a preliminary injunction, and the final hearing and order is similar to a permanent injunction. The main difference lies in which party must bring the issue before the court. While in the injunction setting, the party seeking the injunction must prosecute the action, in proceedings for relief from the automatic stay, the enjoined party must move. The difference does not, however, shift the burden of proof. Subsection (g) leaves that burden on the party opposing relief from the stay (that is, on the party seeking continuance of the injunction) on the issue of adequate protection.\nAt the expedited hearing under subsection (e), and at all hearings on relief from the stay, the only issue will be the claim of the creditor and the lack of adequate protection or existence of other cause for relief from the stay. This hearing will not be the appropriate time at which to bring in other issues, such as counterclaims against the creditor on largely unrelated matters. Those counterclaims are not to be handled in the summary fashion that the preliminary hearing under this provision will be. Rather, they will be the subject of more complete proceedings by the trustees to recover property of the estate or to object to the allowance of a claim.\nSection 5(a)(3) of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, referred to in subsecs.

      "text": "The U.S. vacation rental market size was estimated at USD 17.47 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9% from 2024 to 2030. The growing participation of travelers in the tourism sector from across the globe is growing immensely and is primarily contributing to the growth of the U.S. vacation rental market. With increasing trends of type of tourism in market, the participation of demand for vacation rentals accommodation is spreading in the U.S.\nThe U.S. vacation rental market accounted for 19.6% share of the global vacation rental market revenue in 2023. Since vacation rental homes are more economical, provide more comfort and privacy than hotels, and are suitable for families with children and pets, they are preferred by travelers over hotels. Customers are drawn to these properties because of their low cost when compared to hotels with comparable features. For example, 64% of travelers favor vacation rentals over hotels, per the TurnKey Vacation Rentals 2019 poll. Moreover, customers take a number of variables into account when selecting a vacation rental for comfort and facilities when traveling with family.\nThe expansion of government initiatives to stimulate the economy by funneling money into the system is assisting a number of industries in launching their own businesses, which will benefit the expansion of the travel and tourist industry in the U.S. For example, on March 25, 2020, the U.S. Senate approved a USD 2.2 trillion emergency aid package with the goal of reducing the financial hardship brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, beginning of May 13, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve is creating money at a never-before-seen pace to boost the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak.\nAs there are several foreign participants, with few locals as well, the vacation rental industry is highly fragmented. Moreover, the majority of industry participants have acquired recognition and assisted in drawing in customers from around the globe by introducing features and technologies that make traveling simple and convenient. Both organized and unorganized businesses participate in the vacation rental sector; organized players are reported to control a sizable portion of the market.\nWith their massive client bases, well-known brands, and extensive distribution networks, the leading competitors in the vacation rental sector present fierce competition for participants. To keep ahead of the competition, businesses have been using a variety of expansion methods, including mergers and acquisitions, the introduction of new campaigns, technological developments, and geographic expansion.\nThese advancements, when combined with the application of creative tactics, have improved the U.S. vacation rental market by increasing industry rivalry and diversifying the players' clientele. To obtain a competitive advantage over rivals, a rising number of businesses have also started investing in product development.\nBased on accommodation type, the industry has been further categorized into home, apartments, resort/condominium, and others. Home accommodation accounted for a market share of 47.1% in 2023. This is attributed to the great popularity of homes among travelers owing to space accessibility, safety, and admission to amenities. In addition, the low cost of accommodation in rural and travel places is acting as a prime driver for the segment growth.\nThe demand for resort/condominium is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.9% from 2024 to 2030. The segment growth is majorly driven by millennials as they are more inclined toward spending on experiencing numerous facilities including barbeque pits, games, swimming pools, clubhouses, and tennis.\nIn terms of revenue, the offline booking mode accounted for a market share of 66.9% in 2023. This is attributed to the Baby Boomers and Gen X being the prime consumer base favoring offline mode of booking. Growing penetration of the internet and smartphone among consumers is projected to shift consumers\u2019 predisposition toward online booking mode.\nThe online booking mode is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 3.7% over the forecast period. The expansion is attributed to customers' desire for comprehensive access to lodging, facilities, and surplus benefits. The pursuit for genuine travel experiences, convenience, and value for money are three key aspects boosting the growth of internet booking. An upsurging number of new businesses and third-party travel agencies are only offering services through applications and websites.\nThe market is characterized by the presence of a few established players and new entrants. Many big players are increasing their focus on the growing trend of vacation rentals. Players in the market are diversifying the service offering to maintain market share.\nSome key players functioning in the U.S. vacation rental market include, Airbnb Inc., Booking Holdings Inc., and Expedia Group Inc.\nIn December 2020, Airbnb and Nasdaq announced a new joint campaign to host a stay on New Year\u2019s Eve in New York, to close 2020. The one-night stay will be arranged in a private dome with a view of the Times Square ball drop. Mariah Carey, an American singer and songwriter, will be hosting the event for Airbnb and Nasdaq\nIn December 2020, Airbnb announced the launch of Airbnb.org, a nonprofit, which will allow hosts who rent out their properties through the platform to provide discounted and free stays to refugees and essential workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic and natural disasters. The hosts who offer free stays or make continuous donations to Airbnb.org will get a special badge on their profiles, to award the generosity and commitment to people in need. The company has promised 400,000 shares of its stock to support the nonprofit.\nIn October 2020, Vrbo, an Expedia Group, Inc. company, announced that the Utah vacation home with a private ski mountain will be available for booking from 30th October. The property is a one-time only vacation rental listing for one family at USD 100 per night, a fraction of its usual cost.
