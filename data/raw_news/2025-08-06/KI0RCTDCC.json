  "content": "DARTS star Gian van Veen cried his eyes out after being accused of cheating by an opponent.\n\nThe Dutchman suffers from dartitis - a condition which stops players from releasing the dart due to a psychological problem.\n\nVan Veen said on Huw Ware's Tops and Tales podcast: \u201cI still remember one game on the Challenge Tour when I first got dartitis and my opponent was angry at me because he thought I was doing it on purpose.\n\n\u201cI was in tears, crying my eyes out in the middle of Barnsley Metrodome because I was struggling so badly.\n\n\"And for my opponent to tell me I was cheating or something \u2014 it was heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe name is a portmanteau and was coined by Darts World editor Tony Wood in 1981.\n\nThis condition sees darts players of all levels struggle psychologically - and it is suggested it comes from a fear of missing.\n\nAt the highest level, dartitis has affected many of the sport's best players, including five-time world champion Eric Bristow, who said he suffered with the condition for a decade.\n\nNathan Aspinall also appeared to struggle with the condition when he faced Luke Littler in the World Darts Championship on New Year's Day.\n\nVan Veen is still overcoming his issues now - but believes dartitis has actually made him a better player.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe weird thing is, I played better through it. I started averaging like 85 with dartitis.\n\n\"But when I got rid of it, I averaged 92, 93, because in my head, I was like, \u2018You're not going to release the dart until you're 100 per cent sure you're going to hit the target.\u2019\n\n\"So it took a while, but I started playing better, winning more games, and that massively grew my confidence.\n\n\"And that's how I eventually got rid of it.\u201d\n\nFormer Youth World Champion Van Veen is now ranked 18th in the world and has titles in his sights.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to win five world titles.\u2019 I\u2019ll be very happy with my career if I win one.\n\n\"I think so far, my career\u2019s already been very successful. But yeah, I\u2019d love to top it off \u2014 whether it\u2019s in 20, 25, 30 years \u2014 with a world title.\n\n\"Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s next year or in 10 or 15 years. Just win one, and I\u2019ll be very satisfied.\u201d",
