  "description": "Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.\n\nOn today's show, higher US tariffs come into effect, including 39% on Switzerland after the Swiss President left Washington empty-handed. Donald Trump also announces 100% tariffs on semiconductor imports, but companies including Apple will be exempt if they begin moving production back to the US. Relief over those exemptions sees markets rally, helped by TSMC and Samsung.\n\nAlso on the programme, the Bank of England set to cut rates to their lowest in two years as policymakers try to balance a slowing economy with sticky inflation.\n\nToday's guest: Nina Skero, Centre for Economics & Business Research, CEO (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "JOUMANNA: THIS IS BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK EUROPE. THESE ARE THE STORIES THAT SAY OR AGENDA. RESHAPING GLOBAL TRADE. THE SWEEPING U.S. TARIFFS ARE IN EFFECT. DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCES 100% LEVIES ON CHIPS BUT SAYS COMPANIES PRODUCING IN THE U.S. LIKE APPLE ARE EXEMPT. TARIFFS ON INDIA DOUBLE TO 50% WHILE THE SWISS PRESIDENT LEAVES WASHINGTON EMPTY-HANDED. ASIAN STOCKS AND U.S. FUTURES GAINING, TSMC, NVIDIA AND SAMSUNG MAKING GAINS. BANK OF ENGLAND SET TO CUT RATES AS POLICYMAKERS GRAPPLE WITH THE SLOWING ECONOMY. GOOD MORNING. THE EARNINGS ARE COMING FAST. FOUR COMPANIES DROPPED EARNINGS. STARTING WITH SIEMENS, THIRD QUARTER REVENUE 90 POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS VERSUS ESTIMATES OF 90 -- 90.3 7 BILLION. A BIT OF A BEAT THERE, THIRD QUARTER ORDERS AT $24.72 BILLION VERSUS ESTIMATES OF $21.72 BILLION SO THAT A SIGNIFICANT BEAT ON THE ORDER SIDE OF THINGS. THE CEO WILL BE SPEAKING TO BLOOMBERG'S OLIVER CROOK AT 6:45 A.M. LONDON TIME. WE ALSO HAVE RESULTS COMING THROUGH FROM ALLIANZ, SECOND QUARTER REVENUE 44.5 BILLION EUROS, OPERATING PROFIT 44 -- 14.4 BILLION SO A BEAD ON PROFITS. THEY COMPLETED ONE BILLION EUROS OF AN ONGOING BUY BACK IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2025. THEY SEE THE FULL YEAR OPERATING PROFIT IN THE RANGE OF 15-17,000,000,000, SLIGHTLY BELOW ESTIMATES OF 16.8 2 BILLION SO THOSE ARE COMING THROUGH. WE WILL HAVE THE INTERVIEW WITH THE CFO AT 8:30 LONDON TIME. THE -- THE PHARMA SPACE WILL BE IN FOCUS. MARK IS COMING THROUGH -- MERCK IS COMING THROUGH, SAYING THEY HAVE GOT, LET'S LOOK. TRUMP SENT LETTERS, WE KNOW THAT. BRINGING UP THE ACTUAL NUMBERS HERE. I WILL GET THEM TO YOU IN A SECOND, FULL YEAR NET SALES PLUS 2-5% COMING THROUGH ON THE BACK OF THE PRESSURE THE COMPANY IS FACING ON THE BACK OF THE TARIFF THREATS AND LETTERS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN SENDING. THE NUMBER, UP 4-8% AND IT WAS PREVIOUSLY 2-8%. MARK'S CEO WILL BE SPEAKING AT SEVEN: 30 A.M. LONDON TIME AND WE HAVE SENT US AS WELL COMING THROUGH, NET SALES SECOND QUARTER VERSUS ESTIMATES OF 2.7 2 BILLION FOR SANDOZ, 1.05 VERSUS ESTIMATES. SO A BEAT ON THE FIRST HALF IN TERMS OF MID SINGLE-DIGIT NET SALES GROWTH. SIMILAR TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THE FULL YEAR WITH A MARGIN OF 21%. WE GOT A BEAT ON SALES AND CORE FOR SANDOZ. THERE CEO IS ON THE OPENING TRADE AT 7:15 A.M. LONDON TIME. ALL OF THOSE HAVE COME THROUGH SO LET'S TAKE A CHECK AT HOW MARKETS ARE DOING IN REACTION TO THE TARIFF HEADLINES FROM OVERNIGHT. EUROPEAN MARKETS UP 0.2%, FTSE 100 SLIPPING, S & P AND NASDAQ TRADING POSITIVE WITH RELIEF RALLY COMING THROUGH FOR SEMICONDUCTORS, THE ONES THAT SECURED EXEMPTIONS LIKE APPLE, TSMC. SO THAT IS BOOSTING EQUITY MARKETS TODAY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT CROSS ASSET WE ARE WATCHING, WE HAVE THE MSCI ASIA PACIFIC POSITIVE, BIT OF A DIP IN THE NIFTY WITH INDIA BEING THE LATEST TARGET OF TRUMP'S TARIFFS. YIELDS AT FOUR POINT 24 MOVING HIGHER, A WEEK AUCTION YESTERDAY SO ALL EYES WILL BE ON THE 30 YEAR OPTION TODAY IN THE U.S.. THE POUND IN FOCUS AS I SAID, THE RATE CUT FOR IT TODAY IS PENCILED IN OUT OF THE BANK BUT ALL EYES WILL BE ON THE LANGUAGE AND THE CHANGE IN FORWARD GUIDANCE. WE WILL SPEAK ABOUT THAT. BRENT $67 COME UP 0.6%, WEAKENING STOCKPILE SITUATION IN THE U.S. AND BEAR IN MIND THE DOUBLING OF TARIFFS ON INDIA BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO BUY RUSSIAN OIL IS FACTORED IN. PRESIDENT TRUMP SWEEPING NEW TARIFFS ARE OFFICIALLY IN EFFECT. THEY WILL PUSH THE AVERAGE U.S. RATE TO 15.2%, THE EFFECTIVE TARIFF RATE ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS. TRUMP IS STILL SURPRISING MARKETS, ANNOUNCING A 100% TARIFF ON SHIP IMPORTS EXEMPTING COMPANIES MOVING PRODUCTIVE BACK IN THE -- PRODUCTION BACK TO THE U.S.. > > WE WILL PUT ON A TARIFF OF ABOUT 100 PERCENT WHEN CHIPS AND SEMICONDUCTORS, BUT IF YOU ARE STATES OF AMERICA, THERE IS NO CHARGE -- BUILDING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THERE IS NO CHARGE. JOUMANNA: OUR SENIOR EDITOR JOINS ME. LET'S START WITH THESE NEW TARIFFS ON CHIPS. 100% FEELS LIKE A HIGH NUMBER BUT IT COMES WITH EXEMPTIONS. > > THAT IS RIGHT. IT WAS A SURPRISING NUMBER, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO YOU ARE SPEAKING WITH, TIM COOK ANNOUNCING $100 BILLION NEW INVESTMENT IN THE U.S., IT MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT IS HARD TO IMMEDIATELY FIGURE OUT WHO THIS IS SUPPOSED TO IMPACT. IT WILL NOT BE APPLE, IT WILL NOT BE TSMC, THEY ARE INVESTING IN THE U.S., SOUTH KOREA SAYS IT WILL NOT BE THEIR PRODUCERS BECAUSE THEY ARE INVESTING IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE MIGHT BE SOME LEGACY CHINESE CHIP DEVELOPERS WHO COULD BE ON THE DOWNSIDE HERE BUT SOME OF THE BIGGEST SUPPLIERS AND COMPANIES THAT ARE IN THIS SPACE HAVE ALREADY SORT OF ANSWER THE CALL TRUMP WAS ASKING FOR, OR EVEN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DURING THE CHIP SACKED ERIC TO INVEST IN THE U.S.. SO IT WAS A SPLASHY THING TO SAY BUT IT IS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHAT IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THE SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCERS OR EXPORTS, SORRY, IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES. JOUMANNA: LET ME ASK ABOUT THE OF THE BIG HEADLINE AS WELL, WHICH IS THE DOUBLING OF TARIFFS ON INDIA OVERNIGHT. IT REALLY FEELS LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP SEES THE TARIFFS AS A MEANS OF ENHANCING HIS POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. NOT JUST ABOUT THE REWIRING OF TRADE. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS NEW 50% TARIFF RATE AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS ENDS HERE? RAMSEY: LIKE THE CHIPS, HE IS FULL OF SURPRISES. INDIA AND THE U.S. HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING FOR A WHILE, AS WE GOT CLOSER TO AUGUST 7 FOR RECIPROCAL TARIFFS. HE SURPRISED INDIA WITH THE 25% TARIFF, HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED, THREATENING HIGHER RATES BECAUSE OF BUYING RUSSIAN OIL AND HE CAME THROUGH WITH THAT, EFFECTIVELY 50% TARIFFS ON INDIA BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN BUYING RUSSIAN OIL WILL STOP THAT HAS BEEN FLOWING INTO INDIA FOR A WHILE. SINCE IF YOU REMEMBER, FROM THE INVASION OF YOU BRAIN IN 2020 2 -- UKRAINIAN 2022, THE G7 HAS BEEN TRYING TO SQUEEZE THE MARKET, SQUEEZE THE RESIDENT NEW -- THE REVENUE GOING TO INDIA FOR THE SHADOW FLEET. EVERYONE KNEW THE OIL WAS GOING TO INDIA BUT FOR THE U.S. IT TENDED TO BE SOMETHING THEY COULD ACCEPT BECAUSE IN ASIA THEY SEE INDIA AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO CHINA. WHY TRUMP IS BEING SO AGGRESSIVE IS CONFUSING. HE SEEMS TO BE BLOWING UP THE ALLIANCE WITH INDIA, AND HE SEEMS TO BE AGGRESSIVELY TRYING TO PRESSURE RUSSIA TOWARDS A CEASE-FIRE. HE SAID HE WOULD END THE WAR IN UKRAINE. PUTIN DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MAKING THAT WORK FOR HIM. HE HAS A DEADLINE OF THE EIGHTH FOR RUSSIA TO COME TO THE TABLE SO THAT IN RUSSIA THAN IT IS ABOUT INDIA. IN THE MOMENT, HE IS ANGERING INDIA AND MODI AND GOT THE INDIA OPPOSITION ON MODI'S SIDE, CALLING THIS BULLYING OF INDIA. JOUMANNA: QUITE THE ACHIEVEMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, RAMSEY. MEANWHILE, THE SWISS PRESIDENT LEFT WASHINGTON WITHOUT ANNOUNCING ANY SUCCESS IN LOWERING 39% TARIFFS SET BY TRUMP. THEY FACE THE HIGHEST TARIFFS OF ANY DEVELOPED NATION. JOINING US IS OUR SWISS REPORTER. I GUESS SWITZERLAND TRIED THEIR BEST. THE PRESIDENT WENT TO WASHINGTON TO MEET WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO TRY TO BRING TARIFFS DOWN BUT NO, 39% GOING INTO EFFECT. BASTIAN: THE TARIFF RATE WENT INTO EFFECT AS OF MIDNIGHT NEW YORK TIME SO JUST OVER AN HOUR AGO SO AS YOU SAID IT IS THE HIGHEST RATE, WHICH TRUMP SLAPPED ON ANY INDUSTRIAL NATION , IN THE BALLPARK WITH COMPANIES LIKE LAOS AND LESOTHO. IT IS A BLOW TO HER LEGACY. HOWEVER, WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE WORLD RIGHT NOW IS RACING TO MAKE PROMISES TO TRUMP, WHICH WE HAVE SEEN WITH APPLE. I SAY AT LEAST IT IS DOUBTFUL IF ALL OF HIS PROMISES WILL BE KEPT. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN PLAY OUT IN WASHINGTON IS THE SWISS PRESIDENT, AND ALSO IN GENERAL, THE SWISS APPROACH OF IF YOU MAKE A PROMISE, YOU HAVE TO KEEP A PROMISE, AND THE APPROACH TO TRUMP OF SING TO HIM WHATEVER HE WANTS TO HEAR, HE REFUSED TO DO THAT AND THAT IS WHY SHE HAD TO LEAVE EMPTY-HANDED. THAT DOES NOT SAY THAT A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION CAN'T BE FOUND OVER THE NEXT COMING MONTHS. THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW AND THAT NEWEST DEVELOPMENT IS WHEN SHE LANDS, SHE IS ABOUT TO LAND IN BERN, THIS AFTERNOON EUROPEAN TIME, THE SWISS GOVERNMENT WILL MEET FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING. THIS IS JUST ANNOUNCED AND THEN THEY WILL MAKE DECISIONS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DECISIONS THAT WILL BE. SO FAR THEY HAVE SAID THEY WILL NOT IMPLEMENT COUNTERMEASURES. MAYBE THAT HAS CHANGED NOW. IF THAT HAS CHANGED WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED. JOUMANNA: SWISS WATCHES JUST GOT ALMOST 40% MORE EXPENSIVE FOR U.S. CONSUMERS AS OF TODAY. BASTION, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THREE FEDERAL RESERVE POLICYMAKERS SAID THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SOFTENING U.S. LABOR MARKET. COMMENTS BY THE THREE FOLLOW SHARP DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO JOBS DATA. > > THE LABOR MARKET HAS SOFTENED. YOU CAN SEE THIS EVERYWHERE IN THE U.S. ECONOMY. AND HERE AS WELL. ADDITIONAL SLIPPING IN THE LABOR MARKET IS AN UNWELCOME SIGN. THIS MEANS YOU ARE PUTTING TOGETHER I THINK, WE WILL LIKELY NEED TO ADJUST THE POLICY RATE IN THE COMING MONTHS. JOUMANNA: LET'S BRING IN VALERIE TYTEL. THE JOBS REPORT HAS POLICYMAKERS SOUNDING MORE DOVISH. VALERIE: PRESSURE ON THE U.S. DOLLAR AREA DAILY TALKING ABOUT THE SOFTENING JOBS MARKETS, AND LISA COOKED THE FED GOVERNOR, A VOTER THIS TIME AROUND, SAYING SHE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET AND SAID DOWNWARD REVISIONS ARE VERY MUCH SIDE OF A TURNING POINT IN THE U.S. ECONOMY. WE HEARD FROM NEEL KASHKARI SAYING THE LABOR MARKET IS COOLING AND IT WOULD WARRANT CUTTING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. HE PREFERS NOT TO WAIT. THIS DOVISH COMMENTARY LED THE DOLLAR TO CONTINUE WEAKENING. DOWN FOR AROUND FIVE SESSIONS IN A ROW ON THE BLOOMBERG DOLLARS SPOT INDEX, WEAKENING NEARLY 1.5% IN THAT TIMEFRAME. JOUMANNA: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID HE MAY NEED A TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT FOR ANDREA KUGLER THE OUTGOING FED GOVERNOR. ONE PERSON HAS BEEN ELIMINATED TO REPLACE THE FED CHAIR JEROME POWELL. > > WE HAVE STARTED THE INTERVIEWING PROCESS. SCOTT AND DIANE HOWARD. LOTS OF PEOPLE, JD, WE HAVE SOME GREAT CANDIDATES. IT IS PROBABLY DOWN TO THREE. HE DOESN'T WANT THE JOB. DO YOU LIKE THIS JOB BETTER? > > YES, SIR. > > HE WAS A CANDIDATE BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WILL TAKE IT. > > WILL THIS BE TEMPORARY? > > WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO GO WITH A TEMP THEN PERMANENT, I THINK. SO THE 10TH IS GOING TO BE NAMED I WOULD SAY OVER THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS. > > [INAUDIBLE] THE CHAIR? > > THE TWO KEVINS ARE BOTH VERY GOOD. JOUMANNA: THIS IS TURNING INTO A NEW EPISODE OF \"THE APPRENTICE,\" DOWN TO THREE AND WHO COULD LIKELY REPLACE JEROME POWELL? VALERIE: DOWN TO THREE CANDIDATES. HE TALKED ABOUT THE TWO EVANS, A LONG-TIME ECONOMIC ADVISORY. THERE IS ONE MORE NAME, WE ARE NOT TRULY -- NOT SURE WHO HE IS TALKING ABOUT. NEW INTRIGUE WHERE HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT PERHAPS A TEMPORARY CANDIDATE TO SERVE OUT THE REMAINING ADRIANA KUGLER SEAT WHICH LASTS FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS UNTIL THE END OF JANUARY. THIS COULD ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO KEEP HIS OPTIONS OPEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE FED CHAIR PICK MAY OF NEXT YEAR AND GIVE HIM MORE TIME TO ASSESS CANDIDATES, BUT THE NEW PICK FOR THE FED GOVERNOR SEAT ADRIANA COULD IS VACATING HAS FOUR MORE DECISIONS TO TAKE PLACE ON. IT IS UNLIKELY WE GET THAT CANDIDATE SEATED BY SEPTEMBER 17, THEY HAVE TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE WHICH IS ON SUMMER RECESS. BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, THIS COULD TURN INTO AN EPISODE OF \"THE APPRENTICE COULD SEE HOW THIS CANDIDATE VOTES IN THREE MEETINGS DECIDING TO MAKE THE GOVERNORSHIP PERMANENT. JOUMANNA: THE SHOW GOES ON. VALERIE TYTEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. BEYOND TARIFFS, THE DAY AHEAD AND WHAT IS ON OUR AGENDA. BANK OF ENGLAND DECISION COME AT 12:00 U.K. TIME, PRESS CONFERENCE KICKS OFF 12:30 SO DON'T MISS THAT. THEY WILL LIKELY BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES BUT WATCHING OUT FOR THE VOTE SPLIT AND CHANGE IN FORWARD GUIDANCE. ONE: 30, WEEKLY U.S. JOBLESS CLAIMS AND I THINK THIS WILL BE SCRUTINIZED AFTER LAST FRIDAY. 6:00 P.M. U.K. TIME, 30 YEAR BOND AUCTION. A WEAK AUCTION YESTERDAY SO COULD BE IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL FOR U.S. FIXED INCOME. YOU CAN GET A ROUNDUP OF THE STORIES YOU NEED TO KNOW TO GET YOUR DAY GOING IN TODAY'S EDITION OF DAYBREAK. TERMINAL SUBSCRIBERS CAN GO TO DA WHY BIGO ON THE TERMINAL. U.S. TARIFFS HURTING ITS NUMBERS. MORE DETAILS, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JOUMANNA: ACTIVE BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE. TOYOTA WARNED IT WILL TAKE A HIT FROM U.S. TARIFFS. LET'S BRING IN DANNY LEE. IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THEY ARE TAKING A HIT BUT WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TODAY? DANNY: TOYOTA IS SAYING IT WILL TAKE ALMOST $10 BILLION U.S. DOLLAR HIT FROM U.S. TARIFFS. THE EARNINGS OUT AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR, DOWNGRADING OPERATING INCOME FORECAST. IT WAS EXPECTED TO DELIVER FOUR YEAR \u00a58 TRILLION AND THAT IS DOWN TO \u00a53.2 TRILLION, DOWN $4 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS AND THAT IS THE COST OF IMPORTING CARS INTO THE U.S. AND THE DEAL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND JAPAN, LOWER THAN THE 25% THE MARKET EXPECTED AND THAT WILL HATE -- WEIGH HEAVILY ON TOYOTA. IT IS NOT A SURPRISE GIVEN WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CARMAKERS PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, LIKE MERCEDES, COMING UP WITH LOWER OUTLOOKS AND GUIDANCE BECAUSE OF TARIFFS, BUT THIS IS A PUNISHING ONE FOR TOYOTA. JOUMANNA: HUGE NUMBER, $10 BILLION HIT IS SIZABLE. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT THE OUTLOOK AT THIS POINT? ARE THERE GREEN SHOOTS TO SPEAK OF? DANNY: DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THIS IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME, TOYOTA STILL SEES SALES OF 11.2 MILLION UNITS, WHICH BY HAVING UNCHANGED GUIDANCE, YOU WOULD EXPECT THEY WILL HAVE TO PUTT -- PASS ON HIGHER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SO IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ANY DISTRACTIONS OR DYSPLASIA IN FROM THESE TYPE OF THINGS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EARNINGS PICTURE THE FISCAL FIRST QUARTER, IT DID BEAT ON THE OPERATING INCOME LINE. IT HAS KIND OF MET EXPECTATIONS. BROADLY, THE FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS DID DO WELL, BUT STILL, THE MARKET TRYING TO DIGEST THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS, SHARES DOWN 1.1% IN TOKYO. JOUMANNA: DANNY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE UPDATE ON TOYOTA. COMING UP, PUT FROM SAYS THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE HE WILL MEET PUTIN AND ZELENSKYY. DETAILS, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JOUMANNA: WELCOME BACK TO BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE HE WILL MEET WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY SOON IN ANOTHER BID TO BROKER PEACE BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES. > > WE HAD VERY GOOD TALKS WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE WE COULD BE ENDING THE ROUND, ENDING, THE END OF THAT ROAD, THE ROAD WAS LONG AND CONTINUES TO BE LONG BUT THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THERE WILL BE A MEETING VERY SOON. EXCUSE ME? > > HOW CLOSE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? > > I DON'T WANT TO SAY. I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED BEFORE. JOUMANNA: HE SAYS HE HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED BEFORE. THE EFFORT TO CONVENE A MEETING CAME AFTER PUTIN STOOD STEVE WITKOFF FOR THREE HOURS OF DISCUSSION IN MOSCOW. FOR MORE, I'M JOINED BY TONY WHO LEADS RUSSIA COVERAGE. WIDELY ANTICIPATED, THE WITKOFF MEETING WENT ON FOR THREE HOURS. WHAT DO WE KNOW? > > NOT A GREAT DEAL. THE KREMLIN KEEPING ITS CARDS CLOSE TO ITS CHEST. THERE WERE SIGNALS SENT TO TRUMP AND THEY RECEIVED SOME FROM THE U.S. PRESIDENT. THEY SHARE THE U.S. ASSESSMENT THAT THE TALKS WERE CONSTRUCTIVE AND THEY HAD AN OPTIMISTIC TONE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE NITTY-GRITTY. WE HAVE SEEN REPORTING FROM OUR OWN REPORTERS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME DISCUSSION AND FOCUS ON SOME SORT OF LAND SWAP IF THEY GET DOWN TO TALKS AS A WAY TO END THE WAR, BUT THIS IS ALL UKRAINIAN LAND SO THAT IS NOT A CONCESSION FROM RUSSIA. JOUMANNA: TRUMP ONCE AGAIN IS FLOATING THIS THREE-WAY SUMMIT, POTENTIALLY WITH PUTIN. ZELENSKYY AND. HOW LIKELY IS THAT THAT THAT HAPPENS IN DOES THAT TAKE US CLOSER TO WAS CEASE FIRE? TONY: PUTIN AND THE KREMLIN HAVE BEEN PRESSING FOR SOME TIME FOR A SIT DOWN WITH TRUMP AS A WAY TO MOVE TALKS FORWARD AND THE FACT THAT TRUMP SEEMS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS INDICATES I THINK SOME SHIFT ON THE U.S. SIDE. AS FOR A CEASE-FIRE, TOMORROW WAS THE DEADLINE TRUMP SET FOR FIGHTING TO COME TO AN END AND PUTIN TO HOPE THE WAR OR FACE SANCTIONS ON OIL SALES. TRUMP WENT AHEAD WITH PRESSURING INDIA YESTERDAY ANNOUNCING 25% SANCTION AND WE HAVE YET TO SEE EVIDENCE PUTIN WILL COMPLY WITH THE CEASE-FIRE. JOUMANNA: THANKS, TONY. OTHER STORIES MAKING NEWS. SAUDI ARABIA RAISED CRUDE PRICES FOR A SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH, SIGNALING CONFIDENCE AND DEMAND AS OPEC-PLUS CONTINUES TO RAMP UP SUPPLY. SAUDI ARAMCO WILL RAISE CRUDE TO ASIA BY ONE DOLLAR TO 3.2 DOLLARS PER BARREL. THE WORLD'S BIGGEST EXPORTER HAS LED OPEC AND ITS ALLIES IN RAISING OUTPUT AS THEY SEEK BIGGER MARKET SHARE. FORMER LEADERS FROM TESLA'S SUPERCOMPUTER ARE POISED TO BRING A COMPETING STARTUP OUT OF STEALTH AND RAISE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BLOOMBERG UNDERSTANDS THE STARTUP IS DEVELOPING A FULL STACK OF TECHNOLOGY USED TO POWER AI DATA CENTERS FOR THE CAR INDUSTRY. ROUGHLY 20 OR MORE MEMBERS OF TESLA, INCLUDING SENIOR OFFICIALS, HAVE JOINED. CITIGROUP'S CEO HAD A MEETING WITH TRUMP TO DISCUSS HOW THE BANK MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN PUBLIC STOCK OFFERINGS FOR FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, WHICH HAVE BEEN UNDER GOVERNMENT CONSERVATORSHIP SINCE 2008. THE U.S. PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS CONSIDERING BRINGING MORE OF THEIR SHARES ONTO THE MARKET. THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO CUT RATES TODAY IS THE CENTRAL BANK CONTENDS WITH THE SLOWING ECONOMY. WE WILL HAVE THE DETAILS ON WHAT LOOKED -- TO LOOK OUT FOR. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JOUMANNA: GOOD MORNING, THIS IS BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK: EUROPE. I'M JOUMANNA BERCETCHE INDA BY OF THESE OF THE STORIES THAT SET YOUR AGENDA. RESHAPING GLOBAL TRADE. THE SWEEPING NEW U.S. TARIFFS ARE IN EFFECT. DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED AS 100% LEVEES ON SHIPS SAYING COMPANIES PRODUCE IN THE U.S. LIKE APPLE HOUR EXAM. TARIFFS ON INDIA DOUBLED A 50% WHILE THE SWISS PRESIDENT LEAVES WASHINGTON. ASIA STOCKS IN U.S. FUTURES GAIN ON RELIEF OVER THOSE TECH EXTENSIONS. THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS SET TO CUT RATES TO THE LOWEST IN TWO YEARS AS POLICY MAKERS GRAPPLE WITH THE SLOWING ECONOMY. NOW ONTO THE MARKETS WITH THOSE NEW TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENTS. A BIT OF A RELIEF RALLY COMING THROUGH AND SOME OF THOSE TECH NAMES. SEMICONDUCTORS PERFORMING WELL. APPLE UP ALMOST 5% IN AFTER HOURS. THIS AFTER UNVEILING ANOTHER $100 BILLION WORTH OF INVESTMENTS INTO THE U.S. EXEMPTIONS FOR THE TECH NAMES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THIS 100% TARIFF RATE ON SEMICONDUCTORS. EUROPEAN MARKETS LOOKING UP .5%. FTSE 100 LEANING TOWARDS THE RED AS WE GET INTO THE BANK OF ENGLAND MEETING. S & P AND NASDAQ, POSITIVE TODAY IN TRADING. SWITCHING OVER, THE HANOVER FROM ASIA PACIFIC WAS MOSTLY POSITIVE. GREEN ON THE SCREEN. AGAIN, A POSITIVE REACTION WITH CHIPMAKERS THROUGH THE LIKES OF TSMC UP ALMOST 4% IN TRADING WITH THE RELIEF RALLY COMING THROUGH. 10 YEAR YIELDS UP AT 4.24, TWO BASIS POINTS HIGHER. ALL EYES ON THE 30 YEAR AUCTION -- OPTION. WE HAD A WEEK 10 YEAR OPTION. WE SEEN A MASSIVE MOVE LOWER IN YIELDS. PERHAPS INVESTORS WILL NOT ENTICE BY THE LOWER LEVELS. 13370 IS WHERE WE'RE AT, GETTING CLOSER TO THE BANK OF ENGLAND DECISION WHERE A RATE CUT IS EXPECTED BUT WE WILL BE WATCHING OUT FOR THE SPLIT WHETHER THERE'S A VOTE SPLIT AND I LANGUAGE ON THE FORWARD GUIDANCE. BRENT, THE ENERGY COMPLEX, 67 33 IS WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW ABOUT .6% FIRMER ON THE DAY AS WE TALK ABOUT THE EXTRA TARIFFS THAT THE U.S. IS APPLYING ON INDIA FOR BUYING RUSSIAN OIL. KEEP AN EYE OUT ON THE INVENTORY WITH U.S. STOCKPILES DROPPING SURPRISINGLY. LET'S SWITCH OVER BECAUSE WE GOT MORE EARNINGS COMING THROUGH. THIS TIME FROM RHEINMETALL, ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMING STOCKS THIS YEAR ON THE DAX. YOU CAN SEE IT'S UP 190% YEAR TO DATE. FIRST HALF SALES HAVE COME IN A MISS VERSUS EXPECTATIONS. 4.7 4 BILLION VERSUS ESTIMATES OF 4.89 BILLION. THE FIRST HALF OPERATING PROFIT HAS ALSO MISSED A LITTLE BIT VERSUS EXPECTATIONS, 470 5 MILLION VERSUS 491.3 MILLION. IN TERMS OF THE GUIDANCE, THEY STILL SEE THE FULL YEAR'S SALES OF PLUS 25% TO 30%. SECOND QUARTER BACKLOG AT 63 BILLION EUROS. WE'LL JUST FLAGGING THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMING STOCKS ON THE STOXX 600 IN THE DAX AT 190% IS A LOT OF MONEY HAS GONE INTO THE EUROPEAN DEFENSE AFTER THIS YEAR. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MING STORY IN THE U.K. THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS SET TO CUT INTEREST RATES TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN TWO YEARS AS POLICYMAKERS CONTEND WITH THE SLOWING ECONOMY AND A JOBS MARKET RATTLED BY HIGHER TAXES. HOW U.K. CORRESPONDENT LIZZY BURDEN JOINS US NOW FROM LONDON. A CUT IS PENCILED IN, WHERE COULD THE SURPRISES COME FROM? LIZZY: THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY ARE GOING IN STICK TO THIS QUARTER-POINT CUT. TAKING THE KEY RATE TO 4% WHICH IS NOTABLY LOWER THAN THE FED, MAYBE THAT IS SURPRISING EVEN IF IT'S EXPECTED, GIVEN THAT INFLATION IS AT A 17 MONTH HIGH. BUT THE REASON IS THAT THEY WOULD DO THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH AND THE CONTRACTION HIRING. AS YOU SAY, HE COMES BACK TO THE POLICIES FROM THE CHANCELLOR TO RAISE THE PAYROLL TAX AND TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. THAT HIT IN APRIL. THE BANK OF ENGLAND DOESN'T HAVE A MANDATE LIKE THE FEDERAL RESERVE BUT THE GOVERNOR ANDREW BAILEY IS ARGUING THAT THIS SPIKE IN INFLATION WILL BE TEMPORARY. WE ARE EXPECTING THAT TO BE FORECASTED IN THE RISE IN THE SHORT -- SHORT TERM OUTPUT FOR THAT. BECAUSE OF THAT BACKDROP THAT IS WHY WE ARE EXPECTING A THREE-WAY VOTE SPLIT. THIS IS THE EXPECTATION OF A ECONOMIST THAT YOU WILL GET TO VOTING FOR A HALF POINT CUT. TO VOTING FOR A WHOLE AND THE REST VOTING FOR A QUARTER-POINT CUT. WE REALLY NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE GUIDANCE HERE IF THEY CHOOSE TO SCRAP THE WORD GRADUAL TO DESCRIBE THE GREAT PATH AHEAD, THEN OUR ECONOMISTS SAY IT WOULD BE A HAWKISH A. THE MARKETS ARE PRICING IN ONE MORE CUT AFTER TODAY'S CUT BY OUR ECONOMIST SAY IF YOU TAKE AWAY GRADUAL, IT SUGGESTS THAT NOVEMBER IS IN SUCH A DONE DEAL. JOUMANNA: LIZZY BURDEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PREVIEW. OUTSIDE THE BANK OF ENGLAND WE WILL BRING YOU THAT RATE DECISION LIVE. FOR VIEWERS IN THE U.K., WE WILL HAVE FULL COVERAGE OF THE GOVERNOR ANDREW BAILEY'S NEWS CONFERENCE IN A SPECIAL BROADCAST STARTING AT 12:15 P.M. LIVE ON THE TERMINAL LAND ON YOUTUBE. FRANCINE LAQUA WILL SPEAK TO GOVERNOR BAILEY LATER TODAY. WE WILL BRING YOU THAT I INTERVIEW FROM 4:00 P.M. ON BLOOMBERG RADIO AND TV. FOR MORE ON WHAT TO EXPECT I'M JOINED BY THE CEO OF THE CENTER FOR ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS RESEARCH. LIZZY JUST GAVE US A NICE OVERVIEW OF WHAT TO EXPECT. 25 BASIS POINT RATE CUT FULLY PRICED IN. IT'S COMING ON THE HEELS OF YET ANOTHER UPWARD SURPRISE IN INFLATION LAST MONTH. HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO YOU THINK THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL BE PLACING ON THOSE HIGHER INFLATION NUMBERS? > > AS WE HEARD FROM LIZZY GIVEN THEY WERE EXPECTING A THREE-WAY SPLIT, YOU COULD PUT EQUAL AMOUNTS AWAY ON THE FACT THAT INFLATION IS WELL ABOVE TARGET AND ALSO ON THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GENUINE SIGNS OF LOOSENING AND FLOWING IN THE LABOR MARKET. I THINK WITH THE VARIOUS MEMBERS MAKING THEIR CASES, ALL OF THEM ARE CORRECT. IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU PUT MORE WEIGHT, IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY FOR A CUT, APPARENTLY PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE WEIGHT ON THAT. I THINK ONE THING THAT WE MIGHT NOT SEE SO MUCH IN THE MINUTES WOULD BE ON THE BACK OF THE MINDS ON MEMBERS IS ALSO THE AUTO BUDGET EVEN THOUGH I THINK IT'S A FEW MONTHS AWAY, IT PROBABLY WILL HAVE A BIT OF A DOWNWARD IMPACT ON BOTH THE GROWTH TRAJECTORY AND POSSIBLY ON INFLATION. -- [STANDBY] WHICH WASN'T REALLY A GIVEN UNTIL THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE COULD'VE JUST AS EASILY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE CUT WAS AN EXPECTED GIVEN WHERE INFLATION IS AT THE MOMENT. SO I THINK A MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD APPROACH WOULD BE TO NOT CHANGE THE LANGUAGE FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN MOST RECENTLY. JOUMANNA: YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE DOWNSIDE RISK THAT THE AUTUMN BUDGET COULD POSE ON THE GROWTH OUTLOOK. WE ARE LOOKING AT REAL GDP FORECAST OF ABOUT 1.2 PERCENT FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY. IF THINGS SLOW DOWN MATERIALLY BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL GROWTH ENVIRONMENT, BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING AUTUMN BUDGET, WILL THE BANK OF ENGLAND BE ABLE TO CUT AS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO GIVEN THE BACKDROP OF INFLATION IS STILL QUITE STICKY? QUAKES THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE HOPING THAT IF THAT TIME COMES, WHEN THEY WANT TO CUT AGAIN, I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY WILL WANT TO CUT THIS YEAR, HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO POINT TO A MORE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THIS SPIKE IN INFLATION IS TEMPORARY AND THAT HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES AREN'T REACTING TO IT AS IF IT WERE NOT TEMPORARY BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR AS WELL. THERE IS, ON THE ONE HAND, THE EXPECTATION FOR IS THE SPIKE INFLATION GOING TO BE TEMPORARY, AND THEN THERE IS THE QUESTION OF HOW DO EMPLOYEES PERCEIVE IT BECAUSE IF THEY PERCEIVE IT AS PERMANENT AND THEN THEY BRING THAT INTO THEIR NEGOTIATING TABLES AT WORK, THEN WE ARE GOING TO BE BACK AT A POSITION WHERE EVEN IF THE DYNAMICS WEREN'T SUCH AT THE TIME, THAT COULD BECOME ENTRENCHED IN SALARY EXPECTATIONS. JOUMANNA: NINA, CEO OF THE CENTER FOR ECONOMICS OF BUSINESS . MIRSKY IS DUE TO REPORT SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS AT 7:00 A.M. LONDON TIMES. LET'S GET MORE OF WHAT TO EXPECT FROM OUR BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE ANALYST. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING OUT FOR TODAY IN THE MERCIL RESULTS? > > WE EXPECT A VERY WEAK SET OF RESULTS FROM MIRSKY TODAY WITH LOWER EBIT MARGINS. THIS SHOULD BE EXPECTED BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR, WE HAD MAJOR DISRUPTIONS IN THE INDUSTRY LINKED TO THE RED SEA. IT IN THE RATES WERE UP EVEN MORE PERCENT OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. SO NOW, FAST-FORWARD TO TODAY AND WE SEE THAT FREIGHT RATES ARE LOWER AND WE EXPECT THIS SOFTNESS TO TRANSLATE INTO MAERSK Q2 RESULTS WITH ALL EYES BEING ON OUTLOOK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR BECAUSE THE VERY VOLATILE GEOPOLITICAL AND PELLETT -- ENVIRONMENT THAT WE LIVE IN. JOUMANNA: YOU SAY THAT, I NEED TO ASK ABOUT THE T WORD, TARIFFS, HOW ARE TARIFFS LIKELY TO INFLUENCE THEIR BUSINESS AT THE OUTLOOK TODAY? > > TARIFFS ARE A NATURAL NEGATIVE FROM MIRSKY AND FOR THE INDUSTRY AS THEY LEAD TO HIGHER PRICES FOR GOODS AND LOWER DEMANDS FOR CONTAINER SHIPPING SERVICES. THAT BEING SAID, MIRSKY IS VERY WELL-POSITIONED VERSUS ITS PEERS. THEY ARE THE NUMBER TWO PLAYER IN THE INDUSTRY, SO A VERY BIG PLAYER WITH A MARKET SHARE OF ABOUT 15%. THEY ALSO HAVE RELATIVELY SMALL EXPOSURE TO THE CHINA-U.S. ROUTE OF 5% OF VOLUMES, WHICH IS ALSO POSITIVE. LASTLY, THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG BALANCE SHEET WITH LIQUIDITY OF ABOUT $27 BILLION AS OF THE END OF MARCH, SO THEY ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO WEATHER SOME OF THE TERROR OF THE TARIFF STORMS AHEAD. JOUMANNA: IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON IN THE SHIPPING SPACE, YOU ALSO I HAD DISRUPTIONS WERE ANTICIPATED DISRUPTIONS AROUND THE STRATA FOR MOST, WHAT OTHER THINGS SHOULD WE WATCH OUT FOR THAT COULD IMPACT AND INFLUENCE THE RESULTS TODAY BEYOND JUST TARIFFS? > > YOU MENTION THE RED SEA. THAT REALLY IS THE WILDCARD. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING, VERY CYCLICAL INDUSTRY BOILS DOWN TO SUPPLY AND DEMAND. BY SUPPLY I MEAN THE SUPPLY OF NEW CONTAINER SHIPS. FOR INSTANCE, DURING THE PANDEMIC COMPANIES MADE A LOT OF MONEY AND WHEN OUT AND BOUGHT INVESTORS AND SINCE IT TAKES 2-3 YEARS TO ACTUALLY BUILD A CONTAINER SHIP. A LOT OF THE EXTRA CAPACITIES BEING DELIVERED THIS YEAR WE EXPECT A 5%-6% DECREASE IN CAPACITY WHICH IS NEGATIVE. ON DEMAND SIDE WE FACE INFLATION TARIFFS, SLUGGISH GDP GROWTH. SO VERY UNCERTAIN DEMAND ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. JOUMANNA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PREVIEW. FROM BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE. COMING UP, INDUSTRIAL POWERHOUSE SIEMENS REPORTS -- AND THE THIRD QUARTER. WE SPEAK WITH THE CEO. THE INTERVIEW IS NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JOUMANNA: 2.7 8 BILLION EUROS. OUR COLLEAGUE OLIVER CROOK SAT DOWN WITH THE CEO AND HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. > > WE ARE NOT SO HAPPY ABOUT THAT DEAL BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I SAID WHAT I SAID BEFORE. NOW WE HAVE ONE AND WE CAN START MAKING OPERATING SPACE BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE NOW ON TARIFFS. TO REMEMBER ON -- THE UNCERTAINTIES THIS IS A TOPIC AND YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS CAN OF WORMS OPEN FOR A LONGER TIME. I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. SO WE HOPE THAT THIS DEAL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE IS THE DEAL WHICH IS SAID NOW THAT THEY EXECUTE NOW ACCORDINGLY, AND COMPANIES CAN START PLANNING AND ALSO RELEASE INVESTMENTS. ALL OF HER: BUT PART OF YOUR THINKING IS THERE THIS IDEA THAT ACTUALLY KNOW DEAL WITH THE UNITED STATES IS FINAL, AND IF THAT IS THE CASE, HOW DOES THAT ALTER HOW YOU THINK ABOUT RUNNING THE BUSINESS? > > NOBODY CAN SAY WHETHER OR NOT A DEAL IS FINAL. WE KNOW THAT IN 12 OR 18 MONTHS FROM NOW, THERE WILL STILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY. BUT WE SET OUR PLANNING BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE ON HAND IN THE DEAL BEFORE US. WHEN IT COMES TO SIEMENS, WE ARE QUITE RESILIENT SO THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS ON SIEMENS IS MINOR. THAT'S WHAT WE SAID AND WE CONTINUE SAYING THAT FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG LOCAL FOR LOCAL FOOTPRINT, LOCAL FOR A LOCAL UNITED STATES IS ABOVE 85%, AND WE ARE WORKING ON OUR PRODUCTIVITY, WORKING ON PRICES, WHICH WE MIGHT PASS ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS, SO THE WHOLE PACKAGE IS GOOD. THE STRONGEST ONE IS GOOD FOR PRINT AND LOCAL CONTENT. WE HAVE LOCAL PRODUCTS DESIGNED AND TO KEEP ON DESIGNING LOCAL PRODUCTS FOR THE MARKET, NOT ONLY FOR THE THE I DID STATES, BUT CHINA AND THAT HELPS QUITE A BIT. OLIVER: GOING TO THE PART OF THE MARKET WHERE THERE IS MORE CERTAINTY, THE DATA CENTER BOOM HAS BEEN A CENTERPIECE FOR THE CONVERSATIONS WE ARE HAVING ABOUT A I'M BUILDING OUT TECHNOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT SOMETHING YOU SEE. IS THAT GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW ROBUSTLY AND CAN YOU PUT SOME FIGURES AROUND THAT? > > WE DEFINITELY SEE THAT THE DATACENTER MARKET KEEPS ON GROWING. IT'S NOT ONLY THE HYPERSCALER, ITS COMPANIES AND CUSTOMERS WE ARE SERVING. WE ARE SERVING ALL OF THEM, THE LARGE ONES, THE SMALL ONES AND ALSO IN ALL REGIONS. THERE'S A VERY STRONG PORTFOLIO. WE ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT. I WOULD SAY IN MANY CASES, EVEN OUTPERFORMING OUR COMPETITORS. IT HELPS US NOT ONLY IN THE TOP LINE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE BE VERY GOOD PRODUCTS, GOOD TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE A LOCAL FOOTPRINT. WE DOUBLED OUR CAPACITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THIS IS FROM MEDIUM VOLTAGE, LOW VOLTAGE'S, SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS GOING. WE DON'T SEE WHY IT WOULD STOP, IT'S NOT ONLY AT TRADING MODELS BUT THEN COMES INFERENCE OF THE TRADING MODELS, SO THAT WILL GO ON FOR A WHILE. ALL OF HER:. IN ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAS BEEN WILD MOVES ON THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE DOLLAR AND THE EURO. HOW ARE YOU WEATHERING, HOW ARE YOU INSULATING YOUR EARNINGS IN YOUR OUTLOOK FROM THOSE SWINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING? > > I CAN TELL YOU FOR OUR OTHER INTAKE, THE IMPACTS THIS QUARTER IS SLOWLY BASED POINTS. IT'S NOT THAT BIG. SO THEREFORE, AGAIN, THIS IS THINKS OUR GLOBAL FOOTPRINT, LET'S SEE HOW THAT DEVELOPS GOING FORWARD BUT CURRENTLY THIS IS NOT REALLY MY CONCERN. ALL OF HER: AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE DIGITAL INDUSTRIES AND LOOKING AT CHINA, DO YOU SEE A TURNAROUND OR DO YOU THINK IT WILL DO SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE? > > I WOULDN'T CALL IT A TURNAROUND COMPARED TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE PAST, THIS KIND OF RECYCLE RECOVERY. I WOULD SAY I EXPECT THE CHINESE MARKET TO COME BACK GRADUALLY AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE. PC DEC BUSINESS COMING BACK. THE AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS HAVING A SLIGHT INCREASE. SO THEY ARE COMING BACK. CHINESE GOVERNMENT WORKS ON CLEANING OUT THE REAL ESTATE PROBLEMS ON THE ONE SIDE, INVESTING IN HIGH-TECH MANUFACTURING IN ORDER TO DRIVE A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. THEY ARE INVESTING IN GREEN TECHNOLOGIES, SO THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO NOW IT IS TAILWIND FOR US BECAUSE WE ARE THE INCUMBENT IN AUTOMATION. WE DRIVE DIGITIZATION IN THIS COUNTRY AS WELL AND ALSO ELECTRIFICATION THAT HELPS THE MARKETS, ACCORDING OUR EXPECTATIONS WOULD COME BACK. JOUMANNA: BLOOMBERG'S OLIVER CROOK SPEAKING TO THE CEO. IT'S AT MINIMAL IMPACTS FROM TARIFFS, WHICH IS INTERESTING IN THEM BEING ON THE UP COMING OUT OF CHINA. PLENTY MORE COMING UP ON DAYBREAK EUROPE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a > > THE GEOPOLITICS ARE STILL SOMETHING WE ARE ALL WORRIED ABOUT, SO AS A RESULT, WE DIDN'T GIVE FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE. > > TARIFFS ARE ALWAYS A BAD DEAL FOR CONSUMERS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT 15%, YOU CAN SAY 15% IS BETTER THAN THE 30 THAT WERE ANNOUNCED. BUT IT'S WORSE THAN ZERO. > > WE DID NOT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO SHIP TO CHINA BECAUSE OF THE REGULATIONS. I THINK THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN REALLY OPEN. > > I HOPE THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE MINIMIZED, BUT IT'S OUT OF OUR CONTROL. > > I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S UNDERSTAND SEPARATE -- THE PREDICAMENT WE ARE IN AS THEY MAKE THESE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENTS AND THEY ARE GOING TO WORK WITH US TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR U.S. MANUFACTURING COMPANIES. JOUMANNA: SOME OF THE CEOS WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO ON BLOOMBERG REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF U.S. TARIFFS THAT IT HAS BEEN A MAJOR FEATURE OF THEIR EARNINGS SEASON IN EUROPE AND THE U.S., SO MANY COMPANIES CITING EITHER A BIG IMPACT OR MINIMUM IMPACT. WE SPOKE ABOUT TOYOTA WITH A $10 BILLION HIT FOR THE LARGEST CAR MAKER IN THE WORLD. ANOTHER MAJOR STORY FROM OVERNIGHT. WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP FLOATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A THREE MATE -- THREE-WAY MEETING BETWEEN HIM, PUTIN AND ZELENSKY. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE PREDICTION MARKETS ARE SAYING. EARLIER IN THE YEAR THE ODDS WERE SOMETHING LIKE 70% FOR THE THREE-WAY MEETING HAPPENING. WHEN ALL THE WAY DOWN AND NOW IT'S UP. 28% WITH TRUMP FLOATING THE POSSIBILITY. BUT STILL, LET'S SEE IF IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS THIS TIME AROUND. TOMORROW IS THE DEADLINE FOR THOSE CEASE-FIRE DISCUSSIONS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD IMPOSED ON THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT. LET'S SWITCH OVER, IT'S A BIG DAY IN THE U.K. TODAY WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND EXPECTED TO CUT BY 25 BASIS POINTS. THIS IS THE BACKDROP. QUITE INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ECONOMISTS HAVE BEEN RAISING THEIR CPI FORECAST BY CUTTING GDP ESTIMATES. REMEMBER, THE MOST RECENT INFLATION PRINT SURPRISE TO THE UPSIDE. YOU HAVE UPWARD PRESSURES COMING THROUGH FROM FOOD PRICE INFLATION. THAT IS THE BACKDROP FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND, WILL THEY KEEP THAT CAUTIOUS GUIDANCE ABOUT LIMITED AND GRADUALLY EASING, WILL THEY REMOVE THE WORDING OR WILL THEY SIGNAL THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY CUTTING PUT DOVISH ABOUT THE OUTLOOK BECAUSE OF THE DOWNSIDE RISK TO THE ECONOMY AND NOT MENTIONING THAT BUDGET WHERE YOU COULD SEE FURTHER FISCAL TIGHTENING COME THROUGH. THAT'S THE BACKDROP. SWITCHING OVER IN TERMS OF ZOOMING OUT IN TERMS OF WHERE THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S VERSUS THE FED, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CHART FROM OUR COLLEAGUE DOUG CURTIS. REALLY INTERESTING TO NOTE THERE ARE A FEW EPISODES IN HISTORY WHERE THE RATE DIFFERENTIAL HAS BEEN AS WIDE AS IT IS RIGHT NOW IN THE CUTTING CYCLE BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE U.S. SO IF THEY CUT TODAY THEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN 50 BASIS POINTS RATE DIFFERENTIAL IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE CYCLE AND IT HASN'T HAPPEN THAT OFTEN. IT TELLS YOU OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD ARE BEGINNING TO CUT AT A FASTER PACE THAN THE FED, SOMETHING WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT SO KEEN ON. INTERESTING FACT OVER THERE. AND HE WENT INTO THESE CHARTS, BLOOMBERG TERMINAL USERS CAN ACCESS THEM AND OTHERS USED THROUGHOUT THE SHOW AT GTV  ON THE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL. REMEMBER THERE ARE SO MANY EARNINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HITTING TODAY. WE ARE STAYING ON TOP OF ALL OF THEM UP BLOOMBERG. THE IMPACT OF U.S. TARIFFS WILL BE A BIG ONE. WE WILL ASK ABOUT THAT IN OUR INTERVIEWS COMING UP WE HAVE ONE WITH THE INTERVIEW OF MERCK AND WITH MAERSK. WE HAVE SHIPPING AND PHARMACEUTICALS. OBVIOUSLY MAIN SECTORS THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE STILL NOT A LOT OF CLARITY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING WITH THE SECTORAL TARIFFS. WE DID GET MORE CLARIFICATION ON SEMICONDUCTOR TARIFFS NOW AWAITING PHARMACEUTICALS. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE COMING DAYS. THAT'S IT FOR DAYBREAK EUROPE. THE OPENING TRADE IS UP NEXT.",

  "summary": "The US President has implemented higher tariffs on U.S. products, including those from Apple, while the World Bank of England (BOE) is set to cut these as a result of the higher tariffs. The President's announcement comes as companies like Apple are being targeted with 100% LEVIES on Chips, while companies in the U.K. like Amazon are being singled out for their exclusion. Meanwhile, four major companies have dropped their Q3 earnings, with companies like Allianz reporting a significant decrease in Q3 revenues and an operating profit of 44.5 BILLION EUROS. The Bank of Europe is also set to reduce its Rates as a precautionary measure due to the slow economy. The European Union has been sending out a warning to the public about potential economic instability.",
