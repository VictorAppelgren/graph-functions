  "content": "> > THIS IS \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.\" OUR TOP STORIES THIS MORNING ASIA STOCKS AND U.S. FUTURES UNDER PRESSURE AFTER NVIDIA LEADS A WALL STREET TECH SELLOFF. EUROPEAN LEADERS SET TO BE PLANNING TO SEND BRITISH AND FRENCH TROOP TROOPS TO UKRAINE LOOKING TO LEVERAGE PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S BACKING FOR SECURITY GUARANTEES. DOUBLING DOWN. U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT RAMPING UP ATTACKS ON INDIA. ACCUSING THE COUNTRY OF PROFIT PROFITEERING OFF RUSSIAN OIL. 6:00 A.M. HERE IN JOHANNESBERG. I\u2019M IN FOR JOUMANNA BERCETCHE. LOOKING LIKE THAT NEGATIVE DAY THAT WE DID SEE ON TUESDAY. EXTENDING INTO WEDNESDAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE THAT A LOOK AT U.S. EQUITY FUTURE PSLE NASDAQ DOWN JUST OVER .5%. THAT ACTUALLY COMING AFTER WHAT WAS A RELATIVELY MIXED DAY TUESDAY. THE NASDAQ ENDING THE DAY DOWN 1.5%. THE SECOND WORSE DROP. LED BY A ROUT IN NVIDIA. WE\u2019RE SEEING NEGATIVITY EXTENDING INTO ASIA TRADE. DOWN MORE THAN 1% THERE. WE SHOULD KNOW INVESTORS ARE SQUARELY FOCUSED ON THE MARQUEE EVENT OF THE WEEK. BEFORE THAT, WE WILL GET JULY MINUTES FROM THE FED. THAT IS COMING LATER TODAY AND ALSO MANY INVESTORS PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO SOME EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FROM MAJOR RETAIL NAMES IN THE U.S. COMING LATER TODAY. BRENT CRUDE THOUGH SHOWING A BOIT STRENGTH THIS MORNING TRADING AT $65.88 A BARREL THERE. BITCOIN LARGELY FLAT NOW. WHAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO MONITOR WITH CRYPTOCURRENCYS IS TAKING A LOOK AT THE PULLBACK. WHEN IT COMES TO BITCOIN IT IS HARD TO FORGET IT WAS JUST OVER $124,000 JUST A FEW DAYS AGO NOW TRADING AT $113,000. WE\u2019RE SEEING THE SLIDE PULLING OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCYS DOWN. THE. I WANT TO FLIP THE BOARD AND SHOW YOUR OUR TERMINAL CHART FOR THE DAY. GOOGLE\u2019S MADE IN GOOGLE SHOWCASE IS LATER TODAY. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE AI TRADE THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. THIS EVENT IS MAINLY FOCUSED IN ON THE NEW HARDWARE THAT WILL COME FROM GOOGLE AND POEM DRIVEN AI PRODUCTS AND SEALING WHETHER THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE ANALYSTS BULLISH ON GOOGLE RIGHT NOW BUT THIS IS A LOOK AT THE CHART RIGHT NOW JUST AHEAD OF THAT EVENT FOR ALPHABET LATER TODAY. LET\u2019S STICK WITH THE MARKETS. THE SHARP SELLOFF ON U.S. HEAVYWEIGHT TEXTURES. HAS ADVANCED TOO FAR AND TOO QUICKLY. LET\u2019S BRING IN PAUL DOBSON. THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE IMPETUS FOR SOME OF THIS PULLBACK NOW? WAS THE CURRENT RALLY OVERSTRETCHED? WAS THIS JUST INEVITABLE? > > GOOD MORNING, JENNIFER. I DEFINITELY THINK THERE IS SOME ELEMENT TO HAVE IDEA THAT THE MARKET HAD GONE TOO FAR. I DON\u2019T SEE THIS AS A PARTICULARLY NEGATIVE EVENT NECESSARYLY. THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING SOME OF THE MONEY OUT OF THE TECH STOCKS AND PUTTING IT BACK INTO THE REST OF THE MARKET. IF YOU LOOK AT THE S & P 500 IN THE U.S. YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE, WE SAW 350 OF THE 500 COMPANIES RISING. ONLY 150 LOWER. THE ONES THAT WERE LOWER WERE THE TECH COMPANIES LEADING THE ADVANCE SO FAR. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN IN RECENT DAYS ABOUT THE EVALUATION OF THOSE COMPANIES, ABOUT THE DOMINANCE OF THEM AND THEIR INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF THE INDEX IN THOSE NAMES. THEREFORE THAT -- IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT WE WOULD SEE A PULLBACK AT SOME POINT. PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON NVIDIA, THE BIGGEST OF THE BENCH BUT ALSO ON PALL AN NTEER, UP 150%. ONE OF THE COMPANIES SEEING THE SHARPEST PULLBACK AFTER A BIG PULLBACK RALLY. WE HAVE HAD SOME BETTER EARNINGS AND OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FROM SOME OF THE OTHER NAME IN THE OUTLOOK. WILL FED CHAIR JAY POWELL INDICATE THAT THE FED IS GETTING READY TO CUT INTEREST RATES WHICH WOULD BE POSITIVE FOR MARKETS OR IS HE GOING DIG IN HIS HEELS AND SAY NO, NOT YET? THAT IS PROBABLY THE RISK SCENARIO MARKETS ARE LOOKING TO PRICE IN A LITTLE BIT NOW. > > IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE OTHER MOVERS THAT WE DID SEE, ONE STOCK THAT BUCKED THAT TREND ON WALL STREET WAS INTEL. DO YOU THINK THEY ARE BEING AWARDED R FOR THEIR PATIENCE WITH THE COMPANY? > > YES AND NO. I MEAN, FOR THE WRONG REASONS MAY BE. WHAT WE\u2019RE SEEING IS SOFTBANK HAS PICKED UP. THIS INTEREST AS WELL FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN PROBABLY TAKE THAT EITHER WAY. YES, THE STOCK HAS BEEN TAKING A BIT OF A LIFT RECENTLY. YES IF, THE GOVERNMENT SHOWS A LITTLE BIT MORE INTEREST, YOU CAN EXPECT ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL IT WOULD HELP SOME OF THE TROUBLED PROJECTS INTEL HAS TO SEE THEIR WAY THROUGH. ALSO, YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE QUALMS MAYBE AS A PRIVATE INVESTOR INVESTING IN THE COMPANY WHERE IS THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING AN ACTIVE STAKE. WHAT DOES THAT DO OVER THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK WHEN YOU HAVE THAT INTERVENTIONIST APPROACH? IS IT GOING TO BE LONG-TERM BETTER FOR THE COMPANY OR NEGATIVE? THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INVESTORS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. AND NOW, YOU HAVE VERY STRETCHED VALUATIONS AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. > > THAT NARRATIVE IS STILL EXIST THERE GO DESPITE THE STRENGTH. PAUL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR STARTING US OFF. FOR MORE ON THE MARKET ACTION JOINING US NOW IS SASHA. THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. PAUL WAS JOINING US TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS COMING LATER THIS WEEK FOR JEROME POWELL SPSM THAT WHAT YOU ARE SQUARELY FOCUSED ON NOW? WHAT IS YOUR SENTIMENT? > > ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THE BIGGEST RISK FOR THE FIXED INCOME MARKETS THIS WEEK. HONESTLY THEY HAVE -- THE SHORT END RATES WHICH FED CONTROLS. MORE FOCUSED ON GROWTH, INFLATION. INDEXES HAVE COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTFULLY THE PAST COUPLE OF. HAVE A LOOK AT HOW THE -- COMES OUT BEFORE THE NEXT MEETING PROBABLY WE WILL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF -- IN THE SHORT-END RAT RATES. > > BUT THERE\u2019S A LOT OF INVESTORS SQUARELY ANY SEPTEMBER WE WILL END UP SEEING A CUT. AS A FIXED INCOME INVESTOR, ARE YOU FOCUSED ON SEPTEMBER OR AFTER? > > HONESTLY, WE ARE FOCUSED MORE ON THE LONG-TERM. EVEN WITH THE SEPTEMBER RATE CUT, I DON\u2019T THINK WE\u2019LL SEE IT GO BELOW 4% ANY TIME SOON. FOR US 4% OR 4.8% ARE THE KEY LEVELS TO MONITOR FOR 10-YEAR YIELD. WE ARE NOT FOCUSED ON HOW THE LONG-TERM PICTURE EVOLVES. IN TERMS OF INFLATION, GROWTH DYNAMICS AND OF COURSE WHAT THE U.S. DOES. > > DO YOU STILL REMAIN ON THE SIDE LINES THEN WHEN IT COMES TO U.S. BONDS? > > NOT REALLY. I MEAN, THE U.S. IS THE LARGEST BOND MARKET. AS A FIXED INCOME INVESTOR, YOU CANNOT REMAIN ON THE SIDES. WE HAVE AN OVERWEIGHT ON THE TREASURIES MARKET AS SUCH. MOSTLY TO HEDGE OURSELVES AGAINST OTHER ASSET CLASS. SO IT IS DIFFICULT BUT IT IS MAINLY DURATION. WE ARE SHORT DURATION. WE LIKE TREASURIES. THAT\u2019S HOW WE MOVE OPPOSITIONS. > > WHAT IS YOUR FOCUS WHEN IT COMES TO JEROME POWELL FRIDAY. HE IS FACING PRESSURE ON ALL FRONTS INCLUDING FROM THE U.S. PRESIDENT. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SIGNS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IN HIS STATEMENT. > > I WOULD HATE TO BE IN CHAIR POWELL\u2019S SHOES NOW. HE IS WALKING A VERY THIN LINE AND ADD TO THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S PRESSURE. HONESTLY, I THINK CHAIRMAN POWELL WILL MAINTAIN HIS HAWKISH STANCE. THAT\u2019S MY PERSONAL OPINION. I DO THINK SOME OF THE INVESTORS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR HINT OFST OF A RATE CUT FOR SEPTEMBER COMING FROM CHAIRMAN PAHL POWELL I THINK THEY MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED A LITTLE BIT. > > LET\u2019S TAKE A LOOK OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHERE ARE YOU SEEING OPPORTUNITIES? YOU TALKED ABOUT HEDGING. ARE THERE BONDS YOU\u2019RE LOOKING AT IN THE INTERIM? > > MARKETS PRESENT AN IMMENSE -- FOR INVESTORS. LOOK AT INDIAN HIGH YIELD. MOST OF THE COMPANIES IN THAT SPACE, THEY ACTUALLY DEPEND ON INDIA\u2019S DOMESTIC DEMAND. LOOK AT G & CC. IT HAS BEEN VERY RESILIENT. THE SPREADS HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY -- YET TO BE HONEST. G & CC HIGH YIELD, THE BANKS, SOME OF THE REAL ESTATE BANKS ARE THE REGION, THIS IS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY OUTSIDE THE MARKET. I THINK WE SHOULD DIVERSIFY FROM U.S. TREASURIES AND WE SHOULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT GILTS AGAIN. YOU CAN HAVE -- THERE. THE JOB MARKET IS NOT HOLDING UP. > > AND YOU SAID GOLD AGAIN IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW? > > WE DO HAVE A SLIGHT OVERWEIGHT IN GOLD. WE DO THINK THAT WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED THIS YEAR, GOLD HAS ACTED AS A BIGGER HEDGE RATHER THAN U.S. TREASURIES. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT, CLIENTS SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD IN THE PORTFOLIO. > > I WAS JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THAT. HEAD OF FIXED INCOME STRATEGY AT EMIRATES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. NOW COMING UP, EUROPEAN LEADERS ARE OFFERING TROOPS AS A UKRAINE SECURITY PACKAGE TAKES SHAPE I.E.A. HEAD OF A POTENTIAL PUTIN ZELENSKY MEETING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.\" A PACKAGE OF SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE WILL TAKE SHAPE AS SOON AS THIS WEEK WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS OFFERING TROOPS AS PART OF A POTENTIAL PEACE DEAL. EUROPEAN LEADERS LOOKING TO LEVERAGE DONALD TRUMP\u2019S OFFER AND PLACE DMEEF A STRONGER POSITION AHEAD OF A POSSIBLE MEETING WEEK WHEN PUTIN AND ZELENSKY. YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY QUITE CLOSELY. TALK ABOUT THE CONTOURS AND POTENTIAL SECURITY GUARANTEES DISCUSSED WITHIN THESE LEADERS. > > LOOKS LIKE YAN LEADERS ARE RUSHING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO SEIZE THE MOMENT AND THE MOMENTUM CREATED BY GETTING THOSE -- THE BACKING OF DONALD TRUMP DURING THE WHITE HOUSE MEET. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO SET UP A ROBUST SECURITY FRAMEWORK THAT COULD HELP ENFORCE ANY SORT OF PEACE AGREEMENT EMERGING FROM THIS PROCESS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD DETER RUSSIA IN THE FUTURE WHICH HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS OF THE UKRAINIAN SIDE AS THEY PREPARE FOR THESE MEETINGS. THE DETAILS THAT ARE EMERGING LOOKS LIKE SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL BE CONTRIBUTING TROOPS, SOAGD YERS AS WE HERD EARLIER. BRITISH OR FRENCH SOLDIERS COULD BE INVOLVED. MAYBE AS MANY AS 10 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES COULD BE INVOLVED AND THE U.S. WOULD HELP WITH THINGS LIKE INTELLIGENCE, POTENTIALLY BORDER SURVEILLANCE AND TRUMP HAS MENTIONED THE POTENTIAL FOR U.S. AIR SUPPORT FOR ANY KIND OF SECURITY FRAMEWORK. IT LOOKS LIKE THE LOOKS LIKE THE BASIC ELEMENTS ARE COMING TOGETHER. NAY MIGHT TO. WHO IS GOING TO PROVIDE WEAPONS. THE EUROPEAN SIDE OF THIS PROCESS CREATING THE SECURITY STRUCTURE BEFORE THE PEACE PROCESS CAN CONTINUE DOES LOOK LIKE IT IS COMING T TOGETHER. JENNIFER: YOU MENTIONED THE POTENTIAL TO DETER RUSSIA IN THE FUTURE. > > HAS THE BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW. WE HEARD EARLIER FROM THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR THAT HE WASFUL THAT A MEETING MIGHT HAPPEN AS SOON AS WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS BUT RIGHT NOW WE DON\u2019T HAVE A DATE FOR THE MEETING. WE DON\u2019T HAVE A VENUE FOR THE MEETING. A FEW CITIES, HAVE BEEN FLOATED BUT THERE IS NOT AGREEMENT ON THAT. IT DOES SEEM LIKE EVEN THAT WILL BE A STICKING POINT. HAS THE EASIEST QUESTION GOING INTO THAT MEETING. THE TWO SIDES ARE VERY FAR FROM EACH OTHER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN AGREE ON THINGS LIKE TERRITORY EXCHANGES AND PRISONER EXCHANGES AND THE FUTURE OF CO-EXISTENCE ALONG THIS BORDER AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN ALMOST FOUR YEARS OF WAR. WE ARE PRETTY FAR FROM SEEING EVEN THE CONTOURS OF AN AGREEMENT THERE AND THE MEETING WHERE SERVE HOPEFUL THERAPY HAPPEN RELATIVELY SOON. THE U.S. PRESIDENT IS CERTAINLY PUSHING FOR IT. WHAT THAT HAS DONE IS PUT THE BALL IN PUTIN\u2019S COURT. WE\u2019RE WAITING FOR HIS AGREEMENT TO A MEETING AND THAT\u2019S WHERE WE CAN START SETTING A DATE AND FINDING OUT WHERE IT MIGHT TAKE PLACE. JENNIFER: JOINING US THERE IN HONG KONG. THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING. APPRECIATING IT. HERE IS A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER STORIES WE ARENOLOGY MORNING. SYRIAN STATE MEDIA IS REPORTING THE COUNTRY\u2019S FOREIGN MINISTER HAS MET WITH AN ISRAELI DELEGATION IN PARIS. THE TWO SIDES REPORTEDLY HELD U.S.-MEDIATED TALKS FOCUSEDDED ON STABILIZING THE SITUATION IN SYRIA. AND STOPPING INTERVENTION IN SYRIA\u2019S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. AND NETANYAHU HAS ACCUSED THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER OF BETRAYAL FOR PLANNING TO RECOGNIZE A PALESTINIAN STATE. TENSIONS HAVE ESCALATED FURTHER AFTER CANCELING THE VISA OF A MEMBER OF THE ZIONISM PARTY SCHEDULED TO SPEAK IN AUSTRALIA. IZ A RAIL REVOKED FOR AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATS. COMING UP, RETURN TO THE AFRICAN REGION. DISCUSSING THE FISCAL SITUATION. WHAT INVESTORS WILL BE WATCHING FOR NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.\" AN IMF MISSION IS HEADED TO SEN SENEGAL TO DISCUSS DATA ISSUES. TO SEE IF THE ADMINISTRATION WILL GET CLOSER TO SECURING FUNDING. WHAT KIND OF CLARITY IS THE IMF SEEKING FROM THIS REVIEW AND FROM THIS TRIP? > > GOOD MORNING. THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS HOW DOES $7 BILLION IN DEBT GO UNDETECTED FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS WITHOUT ANYBODY EVER KNOW? THEY HAD AN I.M.F. PROGRAM. THE DEBT WENT UNREPORTED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. AS A RESULT YOU HAVE THIS -- 7 BILLION THAT NOBODY CAN ACCOUNT FOR. BIGGER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED AS $7 BILLION. THIS HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE SEEN DEBT TO GDP BALLOON AT THE 100% MARK. THE GOVERNMENT IS JUST LOOKING AT ALL FACTORS THAT HAVE LED THEM TO THIS POINT AND TRYING TO SEE HOW -- WHAT THIS -- FOR SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT NOBODY EVER TAKING NOTE AND AS A RESULT THIS HAS CAUSED A LOT OF ANXIETY. IMPACTED NEGATIVELY. I.M.F. WILL BE SEEKING GUARANTEES THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN AND YOU CANNOT SAY THAT FOR CERTAINTY, THERE ARE CERTAIN MEASURES THEY WOULD LEAK TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT PUT IN PLACE, FOR EXAMPLE DO THE PAPERWORK, TAKE EVERYTHING -- THEY ARE TRYING FOLLOW AND ALSO PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL AND -- IN THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION. THERE WILL BE A FEW CONDITIONS THEY WANTED TO GOVERNMENT TO BRING THE DEFICIT DOWN. REDUCE DEBT TO GDP. BRING IT TO 50% WHICH IS MANAGEABLE. COMPLETELY THEY WILL ALSO BE LOOKING TO -- THEY HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED. $8 BILLION PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE. JENNIFER: THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF FOCUS ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHERE SENEGAL IS RIGHT NOW, ECONOMICALLY, YOU CAN\u2019T REALLY AFFORD ANY MORE DELAYS IN TERMS OF STABILIZING THE FINANCES, CAN THEY? > > THAT\u2019S RIGHT. THEY ACTUALLY CANNOT BECAUSE ONE I.M.F. PROGRAM STANCE BETWEEN SAVVY AND LIQUID THINKITY, THEY LIQUIDITY.THEY WILL HAVE TO RAISE MONEY FAST. THEY WILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR THIS MONEY. HESITANCE TO GIVE THEM MONEY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEED. THE AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY ARE ACTUALLY IN ORDER SO THEY MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK FOR OTHER PLACES. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES AND MAYBE RAISE BONDS. THE PRESIDENT OF SENEGAL IS CURRENTLY IN JAPAN. HE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK FOR FINANCES THERE. SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING IT. TWO MEASURES THROUGH TAXES AND AUSTERITY. IN TERMS OF TAXES, THEY ARE LOOKING TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS. THEY ARE LOOKING AT ROYALTIES. IMPORT TAXES AND TAXES ON -- WHICH MIGHT NOT BE RECEIVED WELL. THE I.M.F. HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR. DO AWAY WITH -- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THEY MIGHT CONSIDER DOING, SUBSIDIES. THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT CAMPAIGNED ON -- THERE ARE SO MANY REFORMS THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO. BRING THE COST OF LIVING DOWN. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. THEY ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. WE DO NOT NECESSARILY KNOW HOW THE GOVERN BUT THEY INHERITED DILAPIDATED COFFERS. JENNIFER: THANKS SO MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE ON SENEGAL THERE. COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP URGING PUTIN AND ZELENSKY TO SHOW SOME FLEXIBILITY AS HE ENCOURAGES THE TWO LEADERS TO HOLD A BYE L BYE LATERAL SUMMIT. MORE ON THAT NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. JENNIFER: THIS IS \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.\" OUR TOP STORIES THIS MORNING. RALLY CRACKS. ASIAN STOCKS AND U.S. FUTURES UNDER PRESSURE AFTER NVIDIA LEADS A WALL STREET TECH SELLOFF. EUROPEAN LEADERS SAID TO BE PLANNING TO SEND BRITISH AND FRENCH TROOPS TO UKRAINE UNDER A POTENTIAL PEACE AGREEMENT LOOKING TO LEVERAGE PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S BACKING FOR SECURITY GUARANTEES AND DOUBLING DOWN. U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT RAMPING UP A TAX ON INDIA ACCUSING THEM OF PROFITEERING ON RUSSIAN OIL. IT IS PAST 8:30 A.M. ACROSS THE EMIRATES. 6:30 A.M. IN JOHANNESBURG. WE ARE SEEING A RISKOFF MOOD TAKE SHAPE WITH THE MARKETS ON THIS WEDNESDAY. A LOT OF THAT BEING CARRYOVER FROM WHAT WE SAW ON TUESDAY. IT IS SEEMING LIKE THE STOCK RALLY WE HAVE BEEN SEEING OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS AN MONTHS TAKING A BIT OF A PAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO TECH NOW. NASDAQ FUTURES LOOKING TO START DAY A BET WEAKER DOWN JUST OVER 4/10 OF A PERCENT THERE. CONSIDERING WHAT HAS BEEN A DOWN DAY FOR ASIA AND THE NASDAQ STILL LOOKING WEAKER AFTER CLOSING ON TUESDAY DOWN 1.5%. IT WAS ITS SECOND WORST DROP SINCE APRIL. A LOT OF THAT, WE WERE TALKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUE PAUL DOBSON ABOUT WAS LED BY A ROUT WITH NVIDIA. TECH FALLING ACROSS THE BOARD CONTINUING WHAT WE WERE SEEING EARLY IN THE DAY IN ASIA. A ASIA PACIFIC INDEX DOWN OVER 9/10 OF A PER THREATEN. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MEETING COMING LATER THIS WEEK FROM JACKSON HOLE, THE SPEECH FROM THE FED CHAIR JEROME POWELL POTENTIALLY GIVING INVESTORS AN INDICATION WHERE THE FED IS HEADED TO NEXT. WE ARE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE FED MINUTES FROM JULY THAT WE WILL GET LATER TODAY. AND NOTABLE EARNINGS FROM U.S. RETAIL HEAVYWEIGHTS GIVING US SOME INSIGHT INTO WHERE THE CONSUMER IS IN THE U.S. BRENT CRUDE UP JUST MARGINALLY NOW, TRADING AT $65.90 A BARREL. WE ALSO HAVE BITCOIN ON THE BOARD LOOKING RELATIVELY FLAT NOW BUT STILL THE PULLBACK WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS IF, YOU REMEMBER A FEW DAYS AGO, IT IS TRADING OVER $124,000 NOW. LOOKING AT 113.649 THERE. OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCYSING ALSO BEING DRAGGED DOWN AROUND BITCOIN. LET\u2019S BRING YOU OUR TERMINAL CHART OF THE DAY. THE FOCUS IS GOOGLE\u2019S SHOWCASE. THAT IS COMING LATER TODAY. YOU MAY BE ASKING WHY. THE FOCUS IS ON A NUMBER OF NEW HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND POTENTIALLY SOME AI DRIVEN PRODUCT THANKS POEM GIVE INVESTORS THAT HAVE MADE GOOGLE AN ALPHABET, OO A BUY MORE BULLISH ON THIS STOCK. THE QUESTION WILL BE WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO BROL BOLSTER SHARES EVEN MORE SO? THAT IS OUR TERMINAL CHART FOR THE DAY FOR YOU. LET\u2019S TURN IT BACK TO GEO POLITICS. MODI HAS WELCOMED IMPROVING TIES WITH CHINA, ATTRIBUTING THE PROGRESS TO A SHARED INTEREST. NEW DELHI AFTER THREATS OF HIGHER TARIFFS FROM THE U.S. SCOTT BESSENT ACCUSING INDIA OF PROFITEERING FROM IT. > > THEY ARE DOING WHAT IT CALL FROM THE INDIAN ARBITRAGE BUYING CHEAP RUSSIAN OIL. MUCH OF THAT IS GOING TO THE RICHEST FAMILIES IN INDIA. WE ALREADY HAVE VERY HIGH TARIFFS ON CHINA. NOW INDIA IS GOING TO SEE WHAT IT FEELS. JENNIFER: STEVEN ENGEL IS JOINING US. WALK US THROUGH WHAT ELSE WE HEARD FROM SCOTT BESSENT. STATES. NOW INDEED THERE NEEDS TO BE A ADMINISTRATION TO THESE COUNTRIES. > > YEAH. SORT OF JUSTIFYING WHY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS HAVING THAT EXTRA 25% TARIFF ON INDIA IN ADDITION TO THE RECIPROCAL TARIFF OF 25% AND AN ADDITIONAL 25% FOR THE BUYING OF RUSSIAN OIL. SOMETHING THAT THE NEW DELHI GOT IS SAYING THEY ARE IN THEIR RIGHT TO BUY THE CHEAPEST OIL ON THE GLOBAL MARKETS. AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING AT N THE BACKGROUND. THAT IS CHINA AND INDIA GROWING CLOSER. MODI GROWING CLOSER WITH MOSCOW. CALLING PUTIN HIS FRIEND. WE\u2019LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, THE LOGICAL QUESTION WOULD BE WHY ISN\u2019T CHINA SLAPPED THAT ADDITIONAL 25% TARIFF? THEY ARE BUYING MORE OIL FROM RUSSIA THAN INCORPORATEDDIA IS. BESSENT THREW OUT SOME NUMBERS SAYING BEFORE RUSSIA\u2019S INVASION OF UKRAINE IN 2022, INDIA BOUGHT ABOUT 1% OF THEIR OIL FROM RUSSIA. NOW IT IS 42%. CLEARLY IT HAS RAMPED UP CONSIDER BLIVMENT THEY TAKE THAT OIL, THAT CRUDE AND SELL IT ON THE MARKET TO THE TUNE OF $16 BILLION. THAT\u2019S WHY THEY ARE TARGETING INCORPORATEDDIA. WITH CHINA, ESSENTIALLY THE INFORMS HAVE STAYED FAIRLY SIMILAR PREENVISION OF THE UKRAINE. THEY HAVE PROVEN TO SCOTT BESS THEY WANT A CHINA HAS DIVERSIFIED ITS SOURCES OF IMPORTED OIL. JENNIFER: YOU WERE ALLUDING TO THIS BUT OF COURSE WE SAW WANG LEE MEETING MODI AND SAW SOME POSITIVITY COMING FROM THIS MEETING. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY BASED ON WHERE YOU SIT? > > I THINK THIS IS A LOGICAL PROGRESSION FROM THE LAST SCO, THEY ARE GOING TO BE MEETING AT THE END OF THIS MONTH IN CHINA. MODI HAS CONFIRMED, THE CHINESE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT MODI WILL GO THERE THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN YEARS THAT MODI GOES TO CHINA. HE WILL BE MEETING WITH XI JINPING. THOSE TWO GENTLEMEN MET, MODI AND XI JINPING BEFORE THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP BUT THEY COULD SEE THE STORM CLOUDS OF PROTECTIONISM. THEY THREW BRICKS THROUGH SCO. THE TWO MOST LARGELY POPULATED COUNTRIES IN WORLD ARE SEEING EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD BORDER DISPUTES, THEY ARE FINDING SOME COMMON IN THE FACE OF THESE TRUMP TARIFFS, ESPECIALLIENEDDIA GETTING THAT AS WELL AND CHINA HAS A PROLONGED TRUCE WITH THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW. SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS THERE. STEVEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US FOR THAT REPORTING. LET\u2019S STICK WITH GEO POLITICS. AFTER MEETING WITH SEPARATELY WITH, PEUT AND ZELENSKY COULD BE HEADED TO A PIVOTAL FACE-TO-FACE SUMMIT. STEVE WITKOFF GAVE THIS VIEW ON THE PROGRESS TOWARD PEACE. > > IT IS OUR JOB TO BRING THE PARTIES TOGETHER TO NARROW THE ISSUES AND THAT\u2019S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES BETTER THAN ANYBODY. HE HAS GOT A REAL SENSE -- HE HAS A REAL SENSE OF WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE FOR UKRAINE TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE AND TOP MOVE THE RUSSIANS. JENNIFER: FOR MORE, WE\u2019RE JOINED BY JULIA, SENIOR LECTURER AT TAYLOR\u2019S UNIVERSITY MALAYSIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. I WANT TO START HERE. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO ON FRIDAY AFTER THE ALASKA SUMMIT WE HEARD FROM ANALYSTS SAYING THAT PUTIN HAD SCORED A WIN. I WONDER IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE EVENTS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS THIS WEEK, HAS THAT BEEN UNDONE? ARE YOU SEEING SOME PROGRESS TOWARD POTENTIAL PEACE IN THIS MEETING BETWEEN PUTIN AND ZELENSKY? > > THAT\u2019S RIGHT. SQUARED A WIN AS THEY SAY AFTER THIS SCWEA MEETING. I DON\u2019T THINK IT HAS BEEN UNDONE BY THE MEETING BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP, ZELENSKY AND THE EUROPEAN LEADERS SUPPORTING UKRAINE. YES, THERE IS PROBABLY SPACE OR REASON FOR CONCERN FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN FOR WHAT WAS DECIDED DURING THAT MEETING AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEETING DONNEL TRUMP WAS CALLING PEUT ON THE UPDATE HIM ON WHAT WAS GOING ON. CLEARLY IT LOOKS LIKE MOSCOW HAS AN UPPER HAND IN THE CONFLICT. PRESIDENT TRUMP PRACTICALLY REPEATING HIS OWN WORDS THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE UNTIL THERE THERE IS A WHOLE DEAL REACHED. TRUMP HAS BEEN REPEATING IT WORD BY WORD AND I DON\u2019T SEE THAT CHANGING. NOW IT COMES TO DONALD TRUMP POSSIBLY PUTTING PRESSURE ON ZELENSKY AND THE EUROPEAN LEADERS IN TRYING TO REACH SOME SORT OF A DEAL BUT IF PUTIN IS UNHAPPY WITH WHAT COMES OUT THERE THEN RUSSIA IS SIMPLY GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING BECAUSE AS I SAID IT HAS AN UPPER HAND AND IT HAS BEEN LIKE TO IN THE BATTLEFIELD AND NOW WE CAN SAY DIPLOMACY AS WELL BECAUSE OF HIS LATEST TRAVEL TO SCEA. JENNIFER: WHAT ARE THE OBSTACLES TO GETTING THIS MEETING BETWEEN PUTIN AND ZELENSKY TO HAPPEN? > > THERE NEEDS TO BE A PREPARATION DONE. THE MEETING BETWEEN PUTIN AND TRUMP WAS HASTILY PLANNED AND IT LOOKS LIKE TRUMP WALKED INTO IT WITHOUT PROPER PREPARATIONS SO THERE WERE -- SOMETHING DISCUSSED AND I PRESUME THERE WERE ISSUES DISCUSSED BEYOND UKRAINE WHICH ALSO PLAYS INTO RUSSIA\u2019S GAME IN TERMS OF WATERING DOWN UKRAINE WITH A BROADER CONTEXT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE UNITED PREPARATION TAKING PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ALIGN POSITION OF THE SIDES BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THAT PUTIN AND ZELENSKY WALK INTO ONE ROOM AND SIGN SOMETHING. TALK AND IT IS OVER AND THEY AGREE OVER SOMETHING AND SIGN IT. FIRST, THERE NEEDS TO BE A DEAL. THE DEAL NEEDS TO BE LYING ON THE TABLE WHICH THE PARTIES AGREED TO AND THEN THEY ARE GOING TO WALK IN AND. IN THOSE CONDITIONS, I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD BE OK TO SIT IN ONE ROOM WITH VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. HE WAS NOT VERY WILLING TO DO AS WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT NEGOTIATIONS. ON, IT IS QUITE UNCLEAR IF THEY ARE GOING TO REACH EVEN IF THESE PREPARATIONS I TALKED ABOUT ARE DONE, IF THEY ARE GOING TO REACH A DEAL IF, THE LAND SWAP IS ON THE TABLE. THERE ARE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. IT REMAINS UKRAINE MUST AGREE NOT TO JOIN NATO. GIVE UP ITS BID FOR JOINING NATO, THE EUROPEAN UNION. RUSSIA STILL ON THE SECURITY GUARANTEES WHICH THE UNITED STATES PROPOSED TO BECOME SUCH A GUARANTOR. IT IS NOT DISPLEER UKRAINE -- ITIS UNCLEAR IF PUTIN WOULD ACCEPT IT AS WELL. JENNIFER: YOU BELIEVE WHAT WE\u2019RE SEEING IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHEN IT COMES TO ISRAEL AND TRUMP\u2019S RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL, CAN BE PUT SIMILARLY TO HOW WE\u2019RE SEEING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEALING WITH ANOTHER GEO-POLITICAL CRISIS WITH UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU SEE THE OVERLAP? > > THE OVERLAP IN MY MIND IS THAT TRUMP -- IT WAS A PARTER TRUMP\u2019S PROMISES DURING HIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO END END THE WARS AND MOVE ON TO ISSUES OF MORE IMPORTANCE, PROBABLY MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN TO THE DOMESTIC ISSUES. SO HE IS QUITE IMPAIRKT PATIENT TO END THOSEN -- IMPATIENT TO END THOSE CONFLICTS IN UKRAINE AND ISRAEL. TO PUT A CAP ON THAT FIRE, THE CON IF I CAN\u2019T THAT IS HAPPENING NOW AROUND PALESTINE. AND THE OVERLAP IS ALSO THAT HE HE WAS UNABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE HE PROMISED TO END THE WAR IN UKRAINE WITHIN 24 HOURS. THAT DIDN\u2019T HAPPEN. NOW WE WANTS THAT WIN DESPERATELY TO BE ABLE TO DECLARE PE GOT THE WIN, PUT AN END TO BOTH CONFLICTS OR AT LEAST HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE COULD AND IT WASN\u2019T UP TO HIM. IT WAS UP TO ZELENSKY AND PUTIN AND BENJAMIN NETANYAHU AND THE PALESTINIAN ADMINISTRATION AND WHATEVER. S THERE OVERLAP HERE MIGHT BE THAT IN THE SENSE THAT NETANYAHU ALSO IS INFLEX NBDL THE SENSE THAT THERE IS A DEAL ON THE TABLE ONCE AGAIN ON THE CEASE-FIRE AS WE KNOW. HAMAS AS OF LATELY AGREED TO THE DEAL BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT ISRAEL IS GOING TO AGREE TO THE DEAL BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION I GUESS PREFERS TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL THE VICTORIOUS END. RATHER HAVE A CEASE-FIRE. AFTER A WHILE THEY WILL HAVE TO RENEW. FOR NETANYAHU, KIND OF THE WAY -- IT IS EVERYTHING AND NOTHING. EITHER WE ARE GETTING IT ALL, SOME KIND OF SETTLEMENTS EXPELLING PEOPLE FROM GAZA AS WELL. I DON\u2019T SEE ANYBODY ACCEPTING THAT. OR WE WILL SIMPLY KEEP FIGHTING AND I DON\u2019T THINK HOSTAGES IN THIS SITUATION MATTER THAT MA MUCH TO NETANYAHU. JENNIFER: THAT COULD COME TO A HEAD NEXT MONTH IF WE SEE OTHER NATIONS RECOGNIZING THE PALESTINIAN STATE. WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANKS SO MUCH. AND ISRAEL\u2019S PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU\u2019S CABINET HAS APPROVED AN INCREASE TO THE BUDGET. THE FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS THE OVERALL 2025 BUDGET WILL BE RAISED BY MORE THAN 30 BILLION WITH THE LION\u2019S SHARE ALLOCATED TO DEFENSE. THE DEFICIT WILL BE RAISED TO 5.2% OF GDP TO THE CURRENT 4.9%. SHARES ARE EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS HELPING TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL MILITARY SPENDING. COMING UP, NEW RESEARCH UPON THES TO TRUMP\u2019S TARIFFS FUELING A GLOBAL TRADE REALIGNMENT WITH CHINA DEEPENING ITS REACH INTO THE GLOBAL SOUTH. THE DETAILS ON THAT NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. JENNIFER: TRUMP\u2019S TARIFFS RESHAPING THE GLOBAL TRADE MAP ACCORDING TO RESEARCH BY S & P GLOBAL. TARIFFS ARE PUSHING CHINA CLOSER TO GLOBAL SOUTH. FOR MORE ON WHAT THAT SHIFT MEANS, LET\u2019S BRING IN JOE. WHAT ARE SOME TRENDS WE HAVE BEEN SEEING THAT S & P HIGHLIGHTED? > > WHAT THIS REPORT IS SHOWING US IS IT IS REALLY QUANTIFY SOMETHING. WHAT S & P IS DOING IS REALLY QUANTIFYING SOMETHING WE HAVE OBSERVED FOR. THE PLACES IN WHICH CHINA IS EXPORTING GOOD, PLACES IN WHICH IT IS INVESTING ARE CLOSER TO THE GLOBAL SOUTH. OVER THE PAST DECADE, THEY HAVE DOUBLED THE SOUTHEAST ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST COMPARED TO GROWTH OF ABOUT 28% IF TO THE U.S., 58% TO WESTERN EUROPE BM YOU ARE SEEING THAT REALLY, REALLY BIG FOCUS FROM CHINA ON PLACES IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH WHERE IT SEES IT CAN EXPAND ITS REACH. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THESE TARIFFS. IT IS AN INCREDIBLY RECENT TREND WHAT S & P IS LOOKING AT HERE. IT EXTENDS FROM TRUMP\u2019S FIRST TERM. SHIFTS IN THE U.S. IN THE FORM OF SANCTIONS IN CHINA. WHEN IT COMES TO CHINA THEY ARE LOOKING AT PIVOTING AND TRYING TO MIND THOSE CLOTHE AREAS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH. JENNIFER: WE DO KNOW OF COURSE CHINA HAS BEEN BECOMING CLOSER TO A NUMBER OF AFRICAN NATIONS. HOW IS IT AFFECTING THE CHINESE ECONOMY? > > WELL, LOOK, I THINK JEN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW THE CHINESE ECONOMY HAS EVOLVED OVER THE LAST SELVE YEARS OBVIOUSLY IN MIDDLE OF THIS ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN THERE IS A LOTS OF CONCERNS WITH CHINA HOW TO SUPPORT SOME OF THOSE IMPORTANT PILLARS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. TRADE IS ONE OF THOSE. WE HAVE SEEN SOMETHING OF SOME PRESSURES ON U.S.-CHINA TRADE AND CHINA NECESSARILY IS LOOKING AT OTHER AVENUES TO INCREASE TRADE. AFRICA IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES. MORE THAN HA WHEN IT COMES TO AFRICA, YOU LOOK AT THE BELTON ROAD INITIATIVE. CLEARLY IMPORTANT FOR CHINA WHEN IT COMES TO GROWTH AND EXPANSION. AGAIN WHAT XI GENERAL PING IS TRYING TO DO IS BUILD THOSE -- JINPING IS TRYING TO DO, BUILD THOSE ROADS, SOUTHEAST ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AGAIN, SHOWING THAT FOR CHINA WHAT IT IS LOOKING TO SHORE UP ITS DOMESTIC ECONOMY, IT COMES DOWN TO EXPANDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. JENNIFER: THANKS SO MUCH. FOR THAT REPORT FROM S & P GLOBAL. THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. AND NOW COMING UP, WE\u2019LL GET THE LATEST IN THE E.V. SPACE AS AS XIAOMI LOOKS TO TAKE ON EUROPE AND TESLA. JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.\" SOMEHOW SMEE LOOKING XIAOMI IS LOOKING TO SELL IT FIRST VEHICLE IN EUROPE. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT XIAOMI HAD TO SAY ABOUT EXPANSION PLANS. ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS OUT THERE? > > XIAOMI IS RELATIVELY NOW THE E.V. BUSINESS. PRIMARILY A MAKER OF PHONES. IT HAS BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL IN CHINA AND IS NOW LOOKING AT PUSHING THAT SUCCESS INTO PLACES SUCH AS EUROPE. I\u2019M SURE THE MIDDLE EAST NOT TOO FAR OFF HERE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SMALL BUT SUCCESSFUL LINE OF POPULAR E.V.\u2019S AND ONES WHICH ARE REALLY AFFORDABLE AND HAVE DECENT TECH UNDER THE HOOD HAS CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OVER THE CHINESE CONSUMER. IT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH TESLA IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER CHINESE COME PET OR THES GOING INTO THE LIKES OF EUROPE. IN ORDER TO TRY AND CHANGE UP THAT COMPETITION A LITTLE BIT MORE. HOW IT CAN DELIVER ON WHAT IT HAS DONE IN CHINA AND HOW THAT WILL TRANSLATE IN OTHER PARTS WHETHER IT BE IN MIDDLE EAST OR EUROPE. JENNIFER: YOU MENTIONED TESLA THERE. ARE WE SEEING TESLA TRYING TO FIGHT BACK FROM SOME OF THIS COMPETITION WE\u2019RE SEEING FROM CHINA? > > ABSOLUTELY. TESLA HAS BEEN URN PRESSURE WITH SALES SLIDING IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD. IN CHINA IT JUST PUT OUT A NEW MODEL PRICING ON THAT AS WELL. THIS TESLA MODDING, A SIX-SEAT VERSION SLIGHTLY LONGER THAN THE NORMAL EVENING. PRICING IT IN A WAY TO -- THE CHINA MARKET. BY DOING SO, HOPEFULLY ITS CAN SPUR SOME OF THOSE SALES THAT IT HAS LOST TO SOME OF ITS CHINESE RIVALS AND HOPEFULLY IT GIVES THEM A BIT OF AN UPLIFT. IT IS STILL WAITING FOR ANOTHER CATALYST TO DRIVE HOME SALES. ESTILL WAITING FOR THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES TO GET APPROVAL FOR THAT. FOR NOW IT HAS AN INTERIM MEASURE IN ORDER TO CAPTURE SOME OF THAT TENSION. JENNIFER: VERY FASCINATING COMPETITION-WISE IN TERVETION V. SPACE. DANNY LEE IN HONG KONG FOR US. DANNY, THNGS THANKS SO MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE IN. LET\u2019S TAKE A QUICK CHECK OF MARKETS RIGHT NOW. FUTURES LOOKING RED ON THE SCREEN NOW. RISK OFF DAY. A LOT OF THAT COMING POTENTIALLY FROM THE PULL BACK THAT WE SAW TUESDAY FROM A NUMBER OF TECH HEAVYWEIGHTS INCLUDING NVIDIA BUT IT IS LOOKING LIKE THE EURO STOCK 50 FUTURES LOOKING TO START THE DAY WEAKER AS WELL. THAT IS WHERE WE LEAVE IT FOR \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.\" I\u2019M JENNIFER IN JOHANNESBURG. STECK WITH US FOR DAYBREAK EUROPE. THAT\u2019S NEXT. THIS THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a",
