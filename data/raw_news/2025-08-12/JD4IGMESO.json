  "title": "A Jurassic Park sequel is one of the Netflix sci-fi movies you need to watch (August 2025)",
  "description": "In August, watch these five sci-fi movies on Netflix, including an underrated Jurassic Park sequel and a unique anime from a musician.",
  "content": "Netflix movies have been setting viewership records this summer. KPop Demon Hunters is now the streamer\u2019s most popular animated film ever. Plus, Golden, one of the film\u2019s singles, is currently No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Meanwhile, Happy Gilmore 2 generated the biggest U.S. opening weekend for a Netflix film with 46.7 million views.\n\nAside from the in-demand movies, Netflix offers an eclectic selection of entertaining movies, especially in the sci-fi genre. One of our top picks this month is The Lost World, the underrated sequel to Jurassic Park.\n\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nJohn Hughes penned three scripts in 1985: National Lampoon\u2019s European Vacation, The Breakfast Club, and Weird Science. The latter two, which he directed, fall under Hughes\u2019 memorable coming-of-age movies in the \u201980s. The link between the two films is Anthony Michael Hall, who stars in both. In Weird Science, Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play Gary and Wyatt, two nerdy teenagers who want to be popular. One night, the duo creates the perfect woman on Wyatt\u2019s computer.\n\nAfter a magical power surge, the boys\u2019 creation comes to life as Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), a beautiful superhuman who serves Gary and Wyatt. With Lisa by their side, the teens gain the confidence they need to throw a party in hopes of winning over their high school crushes. Despite being inferior to The Breakfast Club, Weird Science is a funny and charming version of a Frankenstein story.\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth (2008)\n\nFrom the late \u201990s through 2008, Brendan Fraser was a legitimate action star thanks to The Mummy franchise. One month before The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was released in August 2008, Fraser headlined Journey to the Center of the Earth, an updated adaptation of Jules Verne\u2019s 1864 novel of the same name. Professor Trevor Anderson (Fraser) embarks on an expedition to Iceland with his 13-year-old nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson), to search for his missing brother.\n\nWith the help of an Icelandic guide (Anita Briem), Trevor discovers Verne\u2019s novel is a legitimate map to the center of the Earth. Although they reach the Earth\u2019s center, the trio realizes they must escape or face the same tragic fate as Trevor\u2019s brother. Fraser\u2019s stoicism and comedic timing stand out in this sci-fi adventure film that kids will love.\n\nStream Journey to the Center of the Earth on Netflix.\n\nWhat more can be said about Jurassic Park? The movie remains a landmark achievement in sci-fi filmmaking. The sequel was never going to reach the heights of the original. However, The Lost World: Jurassic Park deserves more credit for being an exciting blockbuster. Four years after the events in Jurassic Park, the greedy capitalist, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), becomes the new CEO of InGen.\n\nFeeling like there\u2019s a market for dinosaurs, Ludlow sends a group of mercenaries to Isla Sorna, aka Site B, to save the remaining dinosaurs in hopes of opening Jurassic Park in California. Learning about InGen\u2019s new plans, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) recruits Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a small team to disrupt Ludlow\u2019s mission. Even with inferior characters, Steven Spielberg\u2019s sequel still soars when the movie features numerous battles between man and dinosaur. Those pesky raptors remain as terrifying as ever.\n\nSouth Korean filmmaker Han Ji-won successfully helmed a sci-fi anime romance made for adults in Lost in Starlight. Set in 2050, Lost in Starlight explores the budding relationship between Nan-young (Kim Tae-ri) and Jay (Hong Kyung). Nan-young is an astronaut who dreams of leading an expedition to Mars. Jay is a musician and handyman. After Jay agrees to fix Nan-young\u2019s record player, the two begin spending more time together.\n\nWhat starts as a worker-client relationship eventually transforms into a loving partnership. For the first time in her life, Nan-young might have something to live for other than a life in space. Lost in Starlight puts some of your favorite adult dramas to shame because of its moving depiction of love and affection.\n\nSturgill Simpson is no ordinary country singer. The Grammy-winning artist is more of an outlaw musician, like Johnny Cash, than a traditional country singer, like Garth Brooks. Simpson is fearless in his pursuit of new sounds, experimenting with different genres along the way. In 2019, Simpson released his fourth album, Sound & Fury, accompanied by a dystopian Netflix anime movie of the same name.\n\nSet to the songs on the album, Sound & Fury follows an enigmatic driver who battles several deadly opponents in a post-apocalyptic world. Think of Sound & Fury as Mad Max mixed with anime. The result is an impressively unique visual album that could stand alone as a triumphant anime film.",

Murphy typically played the fast-talking, cocky hotshot. In The Pickup, Murphy portrays the straight-laced elder statesman who finds himself in a messy situation.\nRussell Pierce (Murphy) is a soon-to-be-retired armored truck driver. Unfortunately for Russell, he\u2019s paired with a dimwit named Travis (Pete Davidson). The duo is hijacked by Zoe (Keke Palmer), who forces Russell and Travis into executing a lucrative heist.

      "text": "This month on Netflix, we\u2019re spotlighting the action comedy. What\u2019s better than mixing in a few laughs with some fight scenes and explosions? Our first movie features an actor \u2014 the funniest man alive \u2014 reprising a legendary role in Beverly Hills.\nOur second pick is a buddy cop movie from the \u201990s featuring an indelible duo. Finally, we\u2019re taking you back to 1980 to experience some blues music. All three action movies are now streaming on Netflix.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024)\nMore often than not, legacy sequels fail to recapture the magic of their predecessor. Look no further than Space Jam: A New Legacy, Zoolander 2, The Exorcist: Believer, and Jaws: The Revenge as examples. Luckily for the Beverly Hills Cop franchise, it has Eddie Murphy, who reprised his iconic role as Axel Foley in the surprisingly effective fourth outing, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\nWhen Axel Foley (Murphy) heads back to Los Angeles, it\u2019s personal. He\u2019s looking to reconnect with his daughter, Jane Saunders (Taylour Paige), a defense attorney. When a criminal organization zeroes in on Jane, Axel teams with her ex-boyfriend (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his two old friends, Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton), to protect his daughter. You can\u2019t fake charisma, and when Murphy slips back into Axel\u2019s fast-talking ways, the movie soars.\nStream Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F on Netflix.\nRush Hour (1998)\nI\u2019m unaware of the national consensus on Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as a buddy cop duo. For me, they\u2019re top draft picks. The martial arts star and the comedic lightning rod joined forces in 1998\u2019s Rush Hour. After the kidnapping of a Chinese diplomat\u2019s daughter, Hong Kong Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) travels to America to work the case. However, the FBI does not want Lee to be involved, so they assign him to be the LAPD\u2019s problem.\nEnter Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker), the obnoxious and smooth-talking cop tasked with babysitting Lee. Lee and Carter initially hate each other. However, the duo realizes that their best chance of saving the little girl is to work together. From Chan\u2019s extravagant fight choreography to Carter\u2019s crisp one-liners, Rush Hour is a classic \u201990s comedy that remains a gold standard for chemistry between co-stars.\nStream Rush Hour on Netflix.\nThe Blues Brothers (1980)\nWith elaborate car chases and thunderous explosions, The Blues Brothers is most definitely an action comedy. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star as Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers, based on their excellent sketch from Saturday Night Live. After being released from jail, Jake reunites with Elwood and checks in on the Catholic orphanage that raised them. Unfortunately, the orphanage will close unless they pay $5,000 in property taxes.\nAfter an epiphany, Jake and Elwood decide to reform their band, the Blues Brothers, and organize a concert to raise money. Along the way, the Blues Brothers are chased by Neo-Nazis, rival bands, police, and a sadistic woman. The music is great, the chases are exciting, and the laughs are nonstop. What more could you want?\nStream Blues Brothers on Netflix."

      "text": "For more than 30 years, audiences have been flocking to every Jurassic Park movie with the promise of seeing lots of dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg\u2019s original 1993 film was one of the biggest movies in the history of Hollywood and eventually led to two sequels. Then, the franchise was dormant for more than a decade before Jurassic World revived it in 2015.\nNow, we\u2019ve got a whole new set of actors preparing to fight dinosaurs for the first time. Jurassic World: Rebirth is set to hit theaters this July 4th weekend, and if you\u2019re preparing to watch the whole franchise in order, we\u2019ll walk you through exactly how to do that:\nJurassic Park (1993)\nThankfully, the chronology of this franchise is not as complicated as some others. The original Jurassic Park is the first movie you should watch and the one that introduces much of the mythology of this world. It follows a group of scientists brought to Dr. Richard Hammond\u2019s Jurassic Park to, basically, test it out before it opens.\nAs you might expect, things go off the rails quickly, and the film\u2019s various characters have to fight for their own survival. Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and Laura Dern star, and all of them appear in at least one more installment of this franchise at some point down the road.\nYou can watch Jurassic Park on Peacock.\nThe Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)\nThe only sequel that Steven Spielberg helmed, The Lost World is the film you should watch immediately after the original Jurassic Park. This film features the return of Goldblum\u2019s Dr. Ian Malcolm and is set on a secondary island where the dinosaurs were bred before they were brought to the park.\nDr. Hammond hires Malcolm to turn the island into a nature preserve where the dinosaurs can roam free. As always happens in these movies, things don\u2019t go exactly as planned. The movie also stars Julianne Moore as Goldblum\u2019s ex-wife.\nYou can watch The Lost World: Jurassic Park on Peacock.\nJurassic Park III (2001)\nThe third and final installment in the first trilogy, Jurassic Park III, features the return of Sam Neill\u2019s Alan Grant and Laura Dern\u2019s Ellie Satler and follows Grant as he is hired for what he believes to be a tourist trip to fly above the secondary island.\nWhen he finds himself landing on the island instead, he must shepherd the group who escorted him back to safety without getting killed by the various dinosaurs lurking in the wilderness. Gruesome and gory in ways the first two movies are not, Jurassic Park III is a trashy, fun end to the franchise.\nYou can watch Jurassic Park 3 on Peacock.\nJurassic World (2015)\nThe movie that relaunched the franchise, Jurassic World, is basically a remake of the original Jurassic Park against an even bigger canvas and with a new cast of characters. The film stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard and is set at Jurassic World, a new theme park that was built on the ruins of the original Jurassic Park.\nPratt plays a dinosaur wrangler who works at the park, and the film follows him as he deals with the inevitable escape of the dinosaurs from their confines. It became one of the highest-grossing movies of all time.\nYou can watch Jurassic World on Peacock.\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)\nFallen Kingdom deals with the aftermath of Jurassic World\u2019s failure in the same way that The Lost World deals with the aftermath of the original Jurassic Park. This time, though, we follow Pratt and Howard\u2019s characters as they return to the island of Jurassic World in an attempt to rescue the dinosaurs there from a volcanic eruption, only to discover that the dinosaurs are being kidnapped to be sold at auction.\nWhen one of those dinosaurs is released in a mansion, the movie briefly turns into a slasher, with pretty delightful results. Jeff Goldblum briefly returns for this installment as well.\nYou can watch Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on Peacock.\nJurassic World Dominion (2022)\nThe final film in the second Jurassic trilogy, Jurassic World Dominion, is designed as a culmination of the entire franchise. That means Neill, Goldblum, and Dern all return and have major roles in this new installment, which is maybe the stupidest movie in the entire franchise.\nDinosaurs are now living among humans around the world, and a new genetic conspiracy brings the old crew together with Pratt and Howard\u2019s characters. It\u2019s a silly movie, but a fun one in spurts.\nYou can watch Jurassic World Dominion on Peacock."

      "text": "Prime Video\u2019s audience loves their favorite accountant. Ben Affleck reprised his role as the brilliant Christian Wolff earlier this year in The Accountant 2. After the action thriller\u2019s theatrical run, The Accountant premiered on Prime Video in early June. The movie nearly reached 80 million worldwide viewers on Prime Video, making it Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 second most-watched film of all time.\nLike many streaming services, Prime Video has a top 10 for the most popular films on the service. One of the selections, Wicked, is an excellent movie to watch this month. Read this guide for recommendations on what to stream on Prime Video.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\n-\nThe Fire InsidePG-13 2024\n-\nHomefrontR 2013\n-\nMission: Impossible - Dead ReckoningPG-13 2023\nThe Accountant 2 (2025)\nOne of the world\u2019s most brilliant minds, who moonlights as a vigilante, returns for a sequel in The Accountant 2. Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an accountant for some of the world\u2019s most nefarious criminals. When the body of Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) is found with \u201cfind the accountant\u201d on his arm, U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) asks Christian to help find the killer.\nKing was trying to track down a Salvadoran family and went to an assassin for help. Christian can\u2019t do this job alone, so he recruits his mercenary brother Brax (Jon Bernthal) as backup. The ensuing investigation leads to an organization of killers who will do anything to keep their secrets buried. Unfortunately for this criminal ring, they are going up against two highly skilled soldiers in Christian and Brax.\nWicked (2024)\nThe Tony Award-winning stage musical finally received its long-awaited feature film adaptation. Directed by Jon M. Chu, Wicked follows the lives of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), a green-skinned introvert, and Galinda (Ariana Grande), the bubbly social butterfly. These two opposites form an unlikely friendship at Shiz University in the Land of Oz.\nAfter a tumultuous meeting with the Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum), the two women go down different paths, as Elphaba becomes the Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda assumes the mantle of Glinda the Good. Wicked is the first of a two-part adaptation. Part two, Wicked: For Good, premieres later in 2025.\nMoneyball (2011)\nHow can you not be romantic about baseball? In a career-defining performance, Brad Pitt plays a general manager looking to shake things up in Moneyball. Oakland A\u2019s general manager Billy Beane (Pitt) faces an uncertain offseason. His three best players are set to depart in free agency, and the team\u2019s owner does not want to overspend for players. Forced to sign players on a tight budget, Billy transforms his entire philosophy as a baseball evaluator.\nWith the help of the Ivy League-educated Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), Bill starts searching for underutilized and undervalued players to build his roster for the 2002 season. This sabermetric approach revolutionized the game of baseball. Who knew a bunch of guys talking in a room about baseball could be so riveting?\nThe Fire Inside (2024)\nThe Fire Inside is based on the true story of Olympic gold medalist, Claressa \u201cT-Rex\u201d Shields (Ryan Destiny), the first American woman to do so in boxing\u2026 twice. That\u2019s not a spoiler for the movie, because Claressa\u2019s Olympic triumph isn\u2019t the ultimate destination, it\u2019s just a stop along the way. The film movingly conveys Claressa\u2019s connection with her coach, Jason Crutchfield (Bryan Tyree Henry), and there\u2019s an understated bond between them. As much as Claressa has to fight her battles in the ring, she\u2019s got a lot of struggles in her daily life as well. Winning Olympic gold hasn\u2019t given Claressa the access to endorsements or lucrative deals that could pull her up to another level. All she ultimately has is her faith in herself and the support of the people closest to her.\nHomefront (2013)\nJason Statham doesn\u2019t always get surrounded by a strong supporting cast in his action flicks, but he\u2019s got a good lineup of colleagues with him in Homefront. Statham plays Phil Broker, a former DEA agent who has retired to raise his daughter, Maddy Broker (Izabela Vidovic), in peace.\nThat peace doesn\u2019t last long as Phil runs afoul of Cassie Bodine (Kate Bosworth), the mother of one of Maddy\u2019s classmates. Cassie enlist her brother, Morgan \u201cGator\u201d Bodine (James Franco), to get Phil out of the way. And through Gator, Phil\u2019s location is leaked to some of the most dangerous men he put away in the DEA.\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023)\nEthan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Grace (Hayley Atwell) have a meet-cute in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning that\u2019s worthy of any rom-com. They might have even had a romantic spark if she wasn\u2019t trying to steal something he needs to save the world. Regardless, Ethan and Grace spend a lot of time joined at the wrist \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 because Ethan\u2019s racing against time to stop an AI known as The Entity.\nThis time, even the U.S. government doesn\u2019t want Ethan and his team to succeed, because if America can control The Entity then it will control the future. All of the other countries have the same mentality, but The Entity is the one really in control. And its reach extends to the real world, where it forces Ethan to make life-and-death decisions. He knows The Entity needs to be destroyed, but it may already be too late for that.\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)\nShia LaBeouf has one of his most moving performances in The Peanut Butter Falcon, which casts him as a crab catcher named Tyler. After literally burning his bridges with his former colleagues, Tyler hides out in the wilderness for their retribution. That\u2019s where he meets Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down syndrome who is also on the run after escaping a facility.\nZak and Tyler emotionally bond, and they decide to stick together to help the former achieve his dream of learning how to wrestle under the legendary Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church). Eleanor (Dakota Johnson), the woman in charge of Zak\u2019s medical care, pursues the duo because she truly cares about Zak\u2019s well-being. And when she sees how well Zak and Tyler are together, she has to question whether bringing Zak home is the right move.\nAnother Simple Favor (2025)\nAfter the events of A Simple Favor, Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) would have to be crazy to have anything to do with Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) ever again. Crazy or desperate. Stephanie\u2019s blip of fame since sending Emily to prison is largely burned out in Another Simple Favor. When Emily is released from prison and invites Stephanie to her destination wedding in Italy, she reluctantly accepts.\nStephanie isn\u2019t the only one from Emily\u2019s old life invited to the wedding. Emily\u2019s ex-husband, Sean Townsend (Henry Golding), and her mother, Margaret McLanden (Elizabeth Perkins), also made the trip. Regardless, Stephanie is expecting a double cross from Emily. And she\u2019s right to be suspicious, but the dangerous twist won\u2019t necessarily come the way she expects.\nConclave (2024)\nThe pope is dead in Conclave, meaning his successor must be chosen. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), the dean of the College of Cardinals, will oversee the election of the next pope. And it\u2019s more than just a choice between the four major candidates. Whoever is chosen will shape the future of the Catholic Church itself.\nThe election may take place behind closed doors in Vatican City, but the secrets that emerge could end the careers of some and potentially spark more scandal in the church. There\u2019s a surprising amount of intrigue in the selection process, and the film also boasts a stellar supporting cast that includes Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini.\nGladiator II (2024)\nIt only took 24 years for a sequel to Gladiator to reach theaters. Russell Crowe\u2019s character remains dead, but Lucius Verus Aurelius (Paul Mescal) carries on the tradition of losing his family and being sold into slavery in Gladiator II. Connie Nielsen reprises her role as Lucilla from the first film, and she was the one who sent Lucius away for his own safety.\nIn Lucius\u2019 absence, Rome is ruled by not one but two mad emperors: Geta (Joseph Quinn) and Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). As Lucius climbs the ranks of the gladiators, a former slave named Macrinus (Denzel Washington) wants to use him to get the emperors out of the way. But Lucius is his own man, like his father before him.\nG20 (2025)\nAction hero Presidents aren\u2019t a new thing, but Viola Davis\u2019 character in G20 might be the first female action hero president. As far as President Danielle Sutton (Davis) knew, this year\u2019s G20 summit in South Africa was supposed to be an ordinary meeting of leaders from across the globe.\nThe Boys\u2018 Antony Starr co-stars in the film as Rutledge, the leader of the terrorists who take the security team by surprise and capture the world leaders. President Sutton manages to get free. And if she wants to save her family and her fellow leaders, then she\u2019ll need to get her hands dirty and do it herself.\nVal (2021)\nEven years before Val Kilmer became a star in Hollywood, he kept home movies from his childhood to his teens and beyond. It was the story of Kilmer\u2019s life that no one had seen until directors Ting Poo and Leo Scott put it all together as Val.\nThis documentary is also a family affair for Kilmer, his ex-wife Joanne Whalley, and their children, Mercedes and Jack. Since Kilmer had lost his voice during his battle with throat cancer, Jack Kilmer stepped in to read the words written by his father as he looked back at everything he went through to become the man he wanted to be.\nHolland (2025)\nWhat\u2019s eating Nancy Vandergroot (Nicole Kidman) in Holland? She\u2019s got a great thing going in this small town with overtly Dutch roots. Nancy\u2019s got a fine husband, Fred Vandergroot (Matthew Macfadyen), and their son, Harry (Jude Hill), is unusually well-behaved.\nIt\u2019s so perfect that the slightest imperfection alerts Nancy that maybe things aren\u2019t so rosy after all. For an optometrist, Fred sure takes a lot of out-of-town trips. Nancy\u2019s pretty sure that means Fred\u2019s having an affair, and she turns to her new friend, Dave Delgado (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), to help her prove it. What they find isn\u2019t what Nancy expected, which turns her world upside down.\nTransformers One (2024)\nTransformers One is the origin story of the franchise\u2019s leading hero and villain: Optimus Prime and Megatron. At this point in their history, Optimus is known as Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth), while the future Megatron is D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry). Both are miners on Cybertron, and good friends as well.\nAfter befriending B-127 (Keegan-Michael Key) and their former boss, Elita-1 (Scarlett Johansson), Orion and D-16 discover that Cybertron\u2019s ruler, Sentinal Prime (Jon Hamm), has betrayed the planet to their enemies. Orion and D-16 are both outraged by this revelation, but they aren\u2019t on the same page about how to handle it. That leads to the beginning of a rift between them that will have dire consequences for the future.\nTwisters (2024)\nThe new Superman, David Corenswet, has a small role in Twisters, which may be significant years down the line. But he\u2019s not the prime attraction here, and neither are Daisy Edgar-Jones or Glen Powell, the two topline stars who have top billing. Instead, it\u2019s the tornadoes themselves that are the stars of Twisters, especially when the film veers into cartoonish levels of destruction.\nYears ago, storm chaser Kate Carter (Edgar-Jones) had a radical idea that tornadoes could be potentially weakened through her experimental method. When the experiment fails, Kate and Javi (Anthony Ramos) are the only survivors from their team. In the present, Javi lures Kate out of retirement to retry her experiment. While back in the field, Kate encounters a YouTube storm chaser, Tyler Owens (Powell), whom she initially dislikes. When the chips are down and the winds are blowing, Kate will be glad to have Tyler on her side.\nThe Accountant (2016)\nThe Accountant 2 is coming very soon, so it\u2019s worth revisiting the original film ahead of time. Ben Affleck plays the unnamed title character in The Accountant, and he\u2019s the best criminal accountant that the underworld can buy. The Accountant\u2019s autism helps his mind crunch numbers and detect fraud inside criminal organizations. In other words, he can sniff out a rat who\u2019s stealing money from his fellow crooks.\nHis latest client is Living Robotics, after an internal client, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), uncovers startling irregularities in the company\u2019s records. Co-owner Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart) hired the Accountant to sort things out, but what he discovers is a deadly conspiracy that won\u2019t only target him. Dana will also become a target because she knows too much about the fraud.\nSmile 2 (2024)\nSmile 2 is an unusual sequel in that the events of the first film aren\u2019t really necessary to understand what\u2019s happening in this one. Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) has no idea who Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is or what happened to her in Smile, and the person who unintentionally connects them is a police officer named Joel (Kyle Gallner). Before long, Skye finds herself plagued by the same curse that afflicted Rose and Joel, and she doesn\u2019t know what to make of all of the creepy smiles she sees on everyone\u2019s faces.\nSkye isn\u2019t just some random woman; she\u2019s a pop star on the verge of even greater stardom. But the curse has a way of getting under its victims\u2019 skin and driving them insane. Skye is no exception, and as the curse stalks her wherever she goes, she rapidly loses the ability to tell what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\nPicture This (2025)\nBridgerton\u2018s Simone Ashley leads the cast of Picture This as Pia, a young woman struggling to keep her photography business afloat as her family prepares for the month-long build-up to the wedding of her younger sister, Sonal (Anoushka Chadha).\nDuring one of the wedding events, a spiritual advisor tells Pia that she will find the love and career success that she has always wanted somewhere in the next five dates that she goes on. Pia doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in that prediction, but the thought of it hangs over her head with every romantic encounter that she has. She also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend, Charlie (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), who is part of the wedding party on the groom\u2019s side. Seeing Charlie again makes Pia reexamine their relationship, and it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the prediction about her love life was wrong.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was such a massive hit both in theaters and on streaming that it\u2019s kind of redeemed everything that happened after the first Super Mario Bros. movie. Animation was clearly the way to go for this adaptation, as Mario (Chris Pratt), Luigi (Charlie Day), and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) look like they stepped out of a Nintendo Switch and into a breathtaking video game world.\nThe story serves as an origin for the Mario brothers, as they accidentally find themselves transported to the Mushroom Kingdom just as it\u2019s under attack by Bowser (Jack Black) and his army of Koopa Troopas. When Luigi gets captured by Bowser, Mario has to discover his inner hero alongside Peach and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) as they search for allies in their struggle.\nBlink Twice (2024)\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t have an on-screen role in Blink Twice, Zoe Kravitz made her directorial debut with this movie. Naomi Ackie headlines the cast as Frida, a young woman who scores an exclusive invitation from billionaire Slater King (Channing Tatum) to visit his private island alongside her best friend, Jess (Alia Shawkat).\nFrida and Jess are lavished with gifts and attention alongside the other female guests on the island. However, Frida notices that she\u2019s experiencing gaps in her memories. When Jess goes missing, Frida is the only one left who remembers her friend. There\u2019s something sinister going on, and this may not be Frida\u2019s first time on Slater\u2019s private island.\nIn the Land of Saints and Sinners (2023)\nLiam Neeson\u2019s action thrillers are kind of a dime a dozen, but In the Land of Saints and Sinners is one of his best. Neeson plays Finbar Murphy, a World War II veteran living in Ireland during \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in the \u201970s. To support himself, Finbar has started working for a crime boss, Robert McQue (Colm Meaney), as an assassin.\nFinbar also befriends a younger contract killer named Kevin (Game of Thrones\u2018 Jack Gleeson), but one of their mutual targets is the brother of Doireann McCann (Kerry Condon), a formidable woman who won\u2019t back down from her revenge. Doireann is determined to avenge her brother, no matter who she has to kill to do it.\nThe Fall Guy (2024)\nStunt man Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is burned out on Hollywood in The Fall Guy. It\u2019s hard to blame him after witnessing the injuries he suffers early in this movie. Unfortunately, Colt ruined his relationship with Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) while he was torching his bridges to the entertainment industry. Nearly two years later, Colt reenters Jody\u2019s life when she\u2019s gotten the chance to direct her own movie.\nJody isn\u2019t exactly happy to see her ex again, but she needs her help. Her star, Tom Ryder (Kraven the Hunter\u2018s Aaron Taylor-Johnson), has gone missing, and this is more than just an actor on an extended bender. Without Tom, there is no movie to be made, and Jody\u2019s career will be over before it starts. Thus, Colt is drawn into a bigger mystery as he tries to locate Tom and make amends with Jody.\nA Quiet Place: Day One (2024)\nTypically, alien invasion movies involve humanity putting up a fight. But in A Quiet Place: Day One, the battle is over before it even begins, as humans can\u2019t withstand an attack by sightless alien hunters. Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) witnessed the carnage herself while on a day out with her cat in the city.\nSam quickly realizes that her survival hinges on her ability to be quiet. Another survivor, Eric (The Fantastic Four: First Steps\u2018 Joseph Quinn), might be the last friend she ever makes. Sam and Eric must stick together if they want to escape New York City and evade the hunters now roaming the Earth.\nThe Bikeriders (2024)\nThe Bikeriders is loosely based upon the experiences of author Danny Lyon, a character portrayed by Mike Faist in this adaptation. But the film is largely reworked into an original story that focuses on three characters: Kathy (Jodie Comer), her lover, Benny (Austin Butler), and the leader of the Vandals Motorcycle Club, Johnny (Tom Hardy).\nJohnny had high-minded ideals when he founded the club in the 1960s. Over the course of the next decade, Johnny and his friends are almost unrecognizable in what they\u2019re willing to do for the club. Despite Benny\u2019s love for Kathy, he keeps getting drawn back into Johnny\u2019s vision for the club, even when it may destroy him.\nKnives Out (2019)\nDaniel Craig sheds his James Bond persona like a separate skin in Knives Out. Craig steps into the role of Southern sleuth Benoit Blanc, a man whose accent is just shy of Foghorn Leghorn territory. However, the voice somehow works for this comedic murder mystery. Ana de Armas has a standout turn as Marta Cabrera, the loyal housekeeper of a wealthy author, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).\nAfter Harlan dies, his spoiled extended family is stunned to discover that his entire fortune has been left to Marta. The family does not know that Harlan was murdered. Plus, Marta is horrified to discover that the evidence points back to her just as Blanc begins his investigation.\nAbigail (2024)\nScream\u2018s Melissa Barrera reunites with directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett for Abigail, a film that is very much unlike her previous genre movies. Barrera plays Joey, a military veteran who has hit hard times. That\u2019s why she agreed to work with Frank (Dan Stevens) and a group of other criminals to kidnap a young girl named Abigail (Alisha Weir).\nJoey tries to form a connection with Abigail to assure the young girl that she will remain safe before learning that the latter is the daughter of a dangerous crime lord, Kristof Lazaar (Matthew Goode). However, the greatest threat to the kidnappers is Abigail herself, because she\u2019s more than she appears to be. When Abigail strikes, it\u2019s lethal.\nCanary Black (2024)\nYou can tell that Canary Black has been on the shelf for a while since it has the late Ray Stevenson in one of his final roles. But it\u2019s also a showcase for Kate Beckinsale to get back into her action heroine mode, which she\u2019s been doing for about two decades now. Beckinsale plays Avery Graves, a CIA operative who has kept her husband, David Brooks (Rupert Friend), in the dark about who she really is and what her job entails.\nWhen terrorists kidnap David, they blackmail Avery into retrieving a file called Canary Black that could lead to an attack on her country. Stevenson plays Avery\u2019s mentor and boss, Jarvis Hedlund, and even he\u2019s not sure he can trust her when she goes rogue. But if Avery can\u2019t find a way out from under the terrorists\u2019 control, she may lose everything she holds dear.\nMonkey Man (2024)\nDev Patel made his directorial debut with Monkey Man, a film in which he also stars as the main character. And despite the title, Patel\u2019s character doesn\u2019t actually transform into a monkey or even go by that name. The audience only knows him as Kid, a man who will do anything to get his revenge on Rana Singh (Sikandar Kher), the corrupt police chief who murdered his mother.\nKid does wear a monkey mask when he\u2019s in the ring for an underground fighting circuit. However, his real disguise is pretending to be an ordinary waiter at a high-end brothel so he can rise through the ranks and get close enough to assassinate Rana no matter what his vengeance costs him.\nTerrifier 2 (2022)\nArt the Clown (David Howard Thornton) is back for another round of terror in Terrifier 2. Some evil entity has resurrected Art yet again, and he goes on another rampage. A teenager named Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is haunted by dreams of Art and she\u2019s convinced that her late father knew how to stop the clown once and for all.\nArt must sense the same thing, since he kidnaps Sienna\u2019s brother, Jonathan (Elliott Fullam), and terrorizes their family. Now, Sienna has to save her brother, but first, she must live through her encounter with Art.\nChallengers (2024)\nYou may have to pay close attention to Challengers, because the story doesn\u2019t take place in chronological order. Zendaya stars as Tashi Duncan, a rising tennis star romantically drawn to two other players on the pro tour: Patrick Zweig (Josh O\u2019Connor) and Art Donaldson (Mike Faist).\nBoth young men want Tashi for themselves, but only one of them is willing to play dirty to get her. Even when one of them wins Tashi\u2019s heart, it doesn\u2019t end the romantic entanglement between this trio as their lives unfold and intersect over several years. Ultimately, the battle between these two men is going to come back to the place where it all began: on the tennis court.\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)\nIn the long wait between Shrek movies, Antonio Banderas\u2019 Puss in Boots has been keeping the franchise alive. But in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, time is almost up for the title character. Puss relies on his nine lives to survive the epic adventures. And now that Puss is on his very last life, he\u2019s truly scared about his potential fate \u2014 so much so that he abandons his identity and tries to live as a normal cat.\nHowever, Puss learns that there may be a way to restore his lost lives if he can find a magical wishing star. Puss isn\u2019t the only one looking for the star, nor the only one who desperately needs what it can offer him. This quest reunites Puss with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), and forces him to reevaluate what he really wants.\nSnack Shack (2024)\nSnack Shack is a coming-of-age comedy set in 1991. A.J. Carter (Conor Sherry) and his friend, Moose Miller (Gabriel LaBelle), are 14-year-olds whose schemes to get money almost always backfire on them. At least until they hit upon the idea of running the local Snack Shack for the summer.\nTheir bond of friendship is tested when A.J. meets Brooke, his attractive new neighbor. Because Moose makes the first move on Brooke, this creates tension between him and A.J., who isn\u2019t willing to simply back off. As Brooke begins to reciprocate A.J.\u2019s feelings, his friendship and lucrative partnership with Moose may come crashing down.\nBob Marley: One Love (2024)\nBob Marley: One Love is a music biopic that takes place late in the life of reggae superstar Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir). After Bob and his wife, Rita Marley (The Marvels actress Lashana Lynch), narrowly survive an assassination attempt in his native Jamaica, it sends him into a creative tailspin that threatens to derail his dreams.\nBefore Bob can resume his message of peace, he has to face his own inner demons and work out his issues with Rita. Bob Marley didn\u2019t have a lot of time in this world, but the film shows that he made the most of what he had and left a lasting legacy of music behind.\nAmerican Fiction (2023)\nAmerican Fiction casts The Batman Part Two\u2019s Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Thelonious \u201cMonk\u201d Ellison, a college professor and a novelist whose books sell very poorly. Monk is also upset that another writer, Sinatra Golden (Issa Rae), has found massive success while seemingly pandering to Black stereotypes. So Monk writes his own novel as a satire of Golden\u2019s books before submitting it for publication.\nMuch to Monk\u2019s surprise and horror, his satire is embraced by the publisher and the general public. The satire of the piece goes unnoticed, as the book becomes so popular that it starts taking over Monk\u2019s life, even though he made sure that his real name wasn\u2019t listed as the author. But once the book is out and Hollywood comes knocking, it may be too late.\nThe Idea of You (2024)\nThe irony of the premise of The Idea of You is that the romantic entanglement of Sol\u00e8ne Marchand (Eileen\u2018s Anne Hathaway) with boy band lead singer Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine) would probably be more of a fantasy for Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s daughter, Izzy (Ella Rubin), than for Sol\u00e8ne herself. But one unplanned encounter between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes soon leads to several others.\nThere is an age gap between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes that does come up in the film, but the bigger issue between them is the celebrity gap. As long as Hayes is a world-famous musician, he and Sol\u00e8ne may never be able to enjoy a normal romance without being hounded by the press.\nRoad House (2024)\nIn this remake of the popular 1989 movie starring Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Elwood Dalton as a former UFC fighter who has fallen on some hard times. Road House gives Elwood a chance for redemption when Frankie (Jessica Williams) recruits him to be the bouncer at her bar, which shares its name with the title of the film.\nElwood\u2019s fighting skills go a long way towards keeping order at The Road House, much to the anger of a local mobster, Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen). Elwood took care of Brandt\u2019s regular goons with ease, but he\u2019ll have a much harder time handling Knox, an enforcer for Brandt who is played by an actual UFC fighter, Conor McGregor.\nThe Other Zoey (2023)\nThe Other Zoey is not a remake of the Sandra Bullock rom-com While You Were Sleeping. But romantic comedy fans may notice some similarities between the two. Josephine Langford stars as Zoey Miller, a high school student who is definitely not the girlfriend of soccer star Zach MacLaren (Drew Starkey), whose girlfriend is also named Zoey (Maggie Thurmon).\nWhen Zach suffers a head injury that gives him partial amnesia, he mistakes Zoey for his girlfriend, and his doctors warn her not to upset him with the truth. So Zoey carries on the deception and gets closer to Zach on a lavish vacation. At the same time, Zoey also feels attracted to Zach\u2019s cousin, Miles Maclaren (Archie Renaux), who shares many of her views about love and life. So, which guy does Zoey really want? You\u2019ll have to watch the film to find out.\nRole Play (2023)\nEmma (The Flight Attendant\u2018s Kaley Cuoco) and Dave Brackett (David Oyelowo) are just about as happy as a couple could be in Prime Video\u2019s Role Play. The Bracketts have two children and a beautiful home in a New Jersey suburb. What they\u2019re lacking is the passion in the bedroom that they used to have before starting a family.\nFor their anniversary, Dave and Emma take a trip to New York and indulge in some role play. That turns out to be a mistake when Bob Kellerman (Bill Nighy) blows Emma\u2019s cover and exposes her as an international assassin. Now, Emma has to use her skills to protect her family and keep her marriage to Dave intact.\nTotally Killer (2023)\nAmazon Studios\u2019 Totally Killer seems to welcome comparisons to Back to the Future, and it\u2019s one of the more unique blends of sci-fi, comedy, and horror. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u2019s Kiernan Shipka stars as Jamie, a teenager who is very familiar with the story about how her mom, Pam (Julie Bowen), survived the Sweet Sixteen Killer 35 years ago. It\u2019s something that Jamie has heard about many times in her life.\nWhen the Sweet Sixteen Killer returns in the present, Jamie finds herself transported back in time to 1987, when her much younger mother (Olivia Holt) was apparently one of the mean girls in school. Yet if Jamie can\u2019t protect Pam in the past then she may not have a future to go home to."

The spin-off anime series takes a surprisingly darker angle to its story, making an already inventive premise even more interesting.\nGreat Pretender (2020)\nNetflix\u2019s Great Pretender is one of the most riveting anime originals fans will find on the service.

Stemming from the success of Yoichi Takahashi\u2019s iconic manga, the story revolves around the passionate young Tsubasa Ozora, a middle schooler with lofty ambitions.

Combined with two leads who ground the story with sincere drama, My Happy Marriage offers plenty of nuance in its character-driven storytelling.\nMashle: Magic and Muscles (2023)\nWhile its premise is far from novel, Mashle: Magic and Muscles uses its magic-school tropes to its strengths.

To live a peaceful life and protect his family, Mash enrolls in a magical academy to prove he can beat magic with sheer muscle. The influences Mashle: Magic and Muscle draws on are quickly apparent, but how it embraces them makes this anime far more fun than contrived. With a dose of Harry Potter and a dash of One-Punch Man, Mashle is a wildly entertaining action-comedy and parody.\nBeastars (2019)\nThe adaptation of Paru Itagaki\u2019s Beastars was one of 2019\u2019s most memorable shonen anime, and fans can finally start season 3. The plot is set in a world of anthropomorphic animals where a cultural divide splits the carnivores and herbivores, and eating meat is illegal.\nAn otherwise gentle wolf and Cherryton Academy student, Legoshi, sees his predatory urges surface when his school is forced to deal with a murder.

Despite its larger-than-life premise, its characters feel grounded, and the story tackles meaningful themes of discrimination.\nInuYasha (2000)\nRumiko Takahashi\u2019s Inuyasha was a shonen manga classic, and studio Sunrise\u2019s anime adaptation did it justice in the early 2000s.

Inuyasha holds up as one of the best fantasy shonen to date. Experienced anime fans will be familiar with its shonen tropes, but its fantasy spin on Sengoku-era Japan, sense of adventure, and whimsical characters make its straightforward story work.\nInuYasha: The Final Act (2009)\nSince the original Inuyasha anime adaptation couldn\u2019t cover all of Takahashi\u2019s manga, fans were eventually treated to Inuyasha: The Final Act, covering the concluding 21 volumes of the series.\nThis direct sequel show picks up from its predecessor, following Inuyasha and Kagome\u2019s continued adventures to recover pieces of the Shikon Jewel and prepare to face the half-demon Naraku.

Studio Madhouse adapted an initial 75-episode anime series, telling the story of the kindhearted Ippo Makunouchi as he goes from a reserved high schooler to an elite boxer.\nWhat started as a way to channel his frustrations from being constantly bullied became a pathway to being one of Japan\u2019s elite featherweight boxers.

The last work before the late creator Akira Toriyama\u2019s passing, this series opens with Goku and his companions mysteriously warped into child-like forms.\nGoku and company travel to the Demon Realm and get wrapped in bombastic adventures, determined to uncover the root of this conspiracy. Using a premise somewhat similar to the catalyst for Dragon Ball GT\u2019s story, Dragon Ball Daima feels like a wonderful celebration of this storied franchise. Daima\u2019s imaginative world and engaging martial arts action are well supported by Toei\u2019s solid animation.\nBlue Box (2024)\nCombining slice-of-life and sports, Blue Box is one of the best anime of the fall season. Adapted from Kouji Miura\u2019s manga of the same name by Telecom Animation Film, the story revolves around first- and second-year high schoolers Taiki Inomata and Chinatsu Kano.\nTaiki goes to the school\u2019s gym every morning to refine his badminton skills. Taiki is secretly motivated by sharing the gym with Chinatsu, while the latter feels inspired by his determination. Blue Box is more evidence of how welcome the sports and romantic, slice-of-life genres are in the medium.

Cold water changes him into a girl, while hot water transforms him back into a boy. Being the third anime adaptation of the series, Ranma \u00bd set high expectations, but it\u2019s been praised for maintaining the story\u2019s spirit. While the plot is fairly simple, it tastefully balances endearing comedy, romance, and martial arts action.\nHunter x Hunter: Phantom Rouge (2013)\nWhile waiting for new chapters of Yoshihiro Togashi\u2019s manga has been a slog, Hunter x Hunter remains a landmark shonen series. On top of two TV adaptations, fans can enjoy the Hunter x Hunter: Phantom Rouge anime movie. It follows the main cast of Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio as the group tries to find Kurapika\u2019s eyes after losing them in an attack.\nHunter x Hunter: Phantom Rouge is considered a non-canon movie to the main series timeline, but it\u2019s an exciting standalone anime on its own terms.

Directed by Masaaki Yuasa and animated by Science Saru, the story revolves around the friendship between the titular dancer, born with unique physical traits, and the blind musician Tomona.\nThe pair are shunned by society due to their physical differences. But they use their musical talents to reach international fame regardless. Inu-Oh\u2019s unique artistry earned the movie critical acclaim, combining social commentary with stylized art direction. The use of 14th-century Japan made for an excellent period piece, which was surprisingly fitting for its rock-opera musical numbers.\nOrb: On the Movements of the Earth (2024)\nWhile it\u2019s not the most high-profile anime this season, Orb: On the Movements of the Earth is nonetheless a worthwhile watch. Animated by Madhouse and adapted from Uoto\u2019s manga, this series centers around child astronomy prodigy Rafal.

One Piece Film: Red is a visual show-stopper that celebrates the elements that havemade this series so beloved since the late 1990s. It might not push the boundaries of what a licensed anime movie can strive for narratively, but it colorfully expands Oda\u2019s world and offers new characters worth exploring.\nHaikyu!! (2014)\nHaruichi Furudate\u2019s Haikyu!! became the biggest sports-themed sensation in manga and anime. Animation studio Production I.G adapts young Shoyo Hinata\u2019s quest to become an elite volleyball player at Karasuno High School.\nDespite his small stature, Hinata is determined to hone his skills, but he soon encounters competition when his middle school rival Tobio Kageyama joins the team. Haikyu!! is critically acclaimed for its refreshing and down-to-earth story and relatable cast of young characters. The volleyball action is thrillingly animated, and Production I.G\u2019s adaptation doesn\u2019t lose sight of the emotionally investing coming-of-age themes.\nDelicious in Dungeon (2024)\nTrigger, one of the most well-known and beloved animation studios in the industry, returns with another fresh anime adaptation. A TV adaptation of writer Ryoko Kui\u2019s manga of the same name, Delicious in Dungeon is a creative cooking-themed fantasy hybrid. The series is set in a fantasy world where the Golden Kingdom is buried underground by a mad magician, with the kingdom\u2019s ruler promising treasure to the guild who can defeat him.\nOne of these guilds\u2019 leaders, Laios, embarks on an underground quest with his companions to save his sister, Falin, with the team resorting to hunting and eating the monsters within for survival. Delicious in Dungeon offers a fun and comedic spin on high-fantasy and Dungeons & Dragons-style adventuring tropes thanks to its cooking-themed trappings.\nPok\u00e9mon Concierge (2023)\nA Netflix-exclusive series, Pok\u00e9mon Concierge is an colorful change of pace for the blockbuster franchise in the anime department. Produced by animation studio dwarf, this series takes place at the Pok\u00e9mon Resort and follows protagonist Haru, a concierge at the vacation resort.\nAcross its four episodes, Pok\u00e9mon Concierge has Haru make meaningful and entertaining encounters with the Pok\u00e9mon and their owners who visit. Studio Dwarf\u2019s stop-motion animation with figurine-like characters is a staple of the creative team, and it lends itself well to this vibrant fantasy world. It may be a brief miniseries even by miniseries standards, but it\u2019s a delightfully lighthearted and concise watch.\nPLUTO (2023)\nNaoki Urasawa is credited with writing and illustrating some of greatest seinen manga in the industry, and Netflix obtained the license for the adaptation of Pluto. Set in the same continuity as Osamu Tezuka\u2019s landmark Astro Boy series, Pluto tells a mystery involving the murder of the heroic robot Montblanc, who fought in the 39th Asian War.\nThings become far bleaker when war veteran and Europol detective Gesicht investigates the grisly killing of the war hero, as the plot unravels a deep-rooted conspiracy against the robots who took part in the war. Though inherently less grounded as a premise compared to the revered Monster, Pluto is a gripping blend of the crime drama and science fiction genres. Urasawa is known for his cerebral stories, and the animation team at Studio M2 brilliantly conveys that in their anime adaptation.\nBaki Hanma (2021)\nDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba (2019)\nDemon Slayer is one of the biggest hits in the modern anime and manga scene. Especially so for the former, as Ufotable brilliantly adapted Koyoharu Gotouge\u2019s manga of the same name to film and TV.\nNetflix now finally has the rights to stream the second season of the series after adding the first season and the Mugen Train arc. Demon Slayer season 2 covers the Entertainment District arc, which sees Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke go to the titular Japanese district in Yoshiwara to investigate a prowling demon wreaking havoc there.\nNaruto (2002)\nAnother anime and manga phenomenon from Shonen Jump Magazine\u2019s era of the \u201cBig Three,\u201d Naruto has effectively become a modern classic for newer generations of anime fans.\nMasashi Kishimoto\u2019s ninja series follows the titular Naruto Uzumaki going from village outcast to hometown hero, as he and the rest of Team 7 tackle an increasingly dangerous set of foes. It\u2019s part of his grand dream to become the Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village, but Naruto has also become known for having a wide cast of fan-favorite characters.\nVinland Saga (2019)\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012)\nCyberpunk: Edgerunners (2022)\nHunter x Hunter (2011)\nNeon Genesis Evangelion (1995)\nGiant robots fighting even bigger monsters is a common theme among anime series, but few have elevated the genre like Neon Genesis Evangelion. The series was set in the then far-off year of 2015, 15 years after the world was attacked by aliens that were known as \u201cAngels.\u201d\nThe show follows Shinji Ikari, a shy and emotionally withdrawn teenager who is forced to become an Evangelion pilot by his manipulative father, Gendo. Shinji slowly rises to the occasion alongside his fellow pilots, Rei and Asuka. However, the Angels aren\u2019t the only ones with secrets on this show. And Shinji will have to face unimaginable nightmares and traumas before he can ultimately confront his own inner demons."

      "text": "Hollywood loves a good comeback story, especially when that actor is as kind and graceful as Brendan Fraser. Thirty years ago, Fraser starred in Encino Man and School Ties, establishing himself as a leading man that would eventually headline blockbusters, like George of the Jungle and The Mummy, for the next 15 years. Although Fraser\u2019s public presence diminished, his talent never disappeared as the world rediscovers his star power again in The Whale.\nDirected by Darren Aronofsky, Fraser stars as Charlie, a 600-pound recluse watching his life slip away in the confines of his two-bedroom apartment. As his health deteriorates, Charlie attempts to reconnect with his teenage daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), who hates him with every fiber of her being. Written by Samuel D. Hunter, who also penned the play that inspired the film, The Whale is a tragic depiction of grief as a man seeks to reconcile with his past. It\u2019s an incredible performance from Fraser, whose resurgence could end with the phrase, \u201cAnd the Oscar goes to \u2026\u201d\nIn an interview with Digital Trends, Fraser and Hunter explain the importance of telling an authentic story about addiction and disease. Plus, Fraser shares what message he hopes the audience will take away from the film.\nNote: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nDigital Trends: Brendan, you mentioned you did not know much about the film or the play going into your initial meeting with Darren. I believe you didn\u2019t even have a script to read. When you started to learn more about the project in that initial meeting, what caught your eye?\nBrendan Fraser: That we would be creating this character in a way that hasn\u2019t been done in films before. To specify, he\u2019s a man whose body is hundreds and hundreds of pounds. It would require, whether it\u2019s me or any other actor, to wear a costume, makeup, and apparatus applications to create that person authentically.\nI watched a lot of movies where weight gain suits were used, and this is not one of those. This one respects gravity and physics and was created through a digital process that you could print the molds from so there was absolute consistency. There was very little digital treatment done to create Charlie.\nThat was a character about a physical challenge. Darren didn\u2019t know if he was going to make the movie or not just based on those elements because if you get it wrong, we don\u2019t have a movie. We don\u2019t have a movie if the first makeup test wasn\u2019t right in that frozen meeting in the Protozoa offices when we first put everything on.\nIf it was wrong, you can\u2019t do it, but that wasn\u2019t the case. And once we got that down, then it\u2019s just a matter of attending to the story points, rehearsing as we did for three weeks, and doing our honest best to approach the piece with as much authenticity and vulnerability as we could muster.\nSam, this is a deeply personal story to you. I know you\u2019re revisiting some dark days in your life. When you were approached to write the screenplay, was there ever a point where you thought to yourself, \u201cI can\u2019t go through with this again. I don\u2019t want to relive these moments?\u201d\nSamuel D. Hunter: I think writing the play and then having the play produced was incredibly cathartic for me. Not to be too neat about it, but like I lost a bunch of weight right after the play got produced in New York. I think I had seen it done enough and worked on it enough and worked with enough collaborators that I could sort of look at it, I don\u2019t want to say objectively because it\u2019s always going to feel vulnerable.\nIt\u2019s always going to feel very, very close to me, but I was nervous. Handing it over to someone on film is a very different process. You know, plays are very ephemeral. It\u2019s one of the things I love about them is because, you know, you see them as they\u2019re happening.\nFraser: It lives.\nHunter: [Laughs] Yeah, but film is etched in marble, you know? So I knew that we had to get it right. Darren knew we had to get it right, and it took a decade to find that guy, and boy, did we find that guy. Boy, did we find that guy. Thank God.\nBrendan, it\u2019s no secret that this performance is going to be a major contender this awards season, and I admire that you\u2019re openly talking about how this is your shot, and you owe it to yourself, the film, and the fans to really go for it. I just wanted to know why you feel so strongly about it that way, to really go for it.\nFraser: This is a story about a man who could otherwise be so easily dismissed, and sadly is so often. We, as a society, have a long way to go, and I think this is a good start toward ameliorating the way that we speak of [and] regard those who live with obesity, which is a disease and often the cause being an addiction. I learned that from having worked at the Obesity Action Coalition and the counsel that they gave me, and I earned their trust and have borne a responsibility to treat the subject with dignity and respect.\nI could do that because of the strength of the filmmaking in this story. Insofar as my fondest hope, I think we can do better. Anyone who comes into this movie, by the story\u2019s end, I\u2019m pretty certain they\u2019re going to rethink or reorient the beliefs or prejudices that they may have upheld before they walked into this film. The fondest hope that we have is to possibly change some hearts and minds.\nWell, I think you did just that.\nFraser: I\u2019ve got to do what I can do to support that.\nThe Whale opens in theaters on December 9."

      "text": "The late John Hughes once mulled a sequel to his 1985 ode to adolescence, The Breakfast Club. The idea was that he\u2019d pick up years later with the same characters, five suburban teenagers from different cliques who look past their differences and forge some common ground over a long Saturday in detention. Simple minds race with the questions Hughes could answer by reconvening his party of five. Would neo-maxi-zoom-dweebie Brian become a meathead, just like the actor who played him, Anthony Michael Hall? Would the glam-up makeover that outsider Allison (Ally Sheedy) receives at the end of the film take? Would burnout Bender (Judd Nelson) escape the lifetime in Loserville so many assume awaits him?\nIt was an intriguing pitch, at least for anyone who\u2019s ever wondered who these fictional Illinois kids might grow up to be. At the same time, maybe it\u2019s a relief that Hughes never got around to pursuing the idea. After all, the enduring appeal of The Breakfast Club rests largely on the narrow parameters it sets for itself: It\u2019s just five kids in one room over a single day. To look beyond this mere snapshot of youth would be to betray its eternal present tense. The movie exists, irresistibly, in the moment, just like the teenagers who flocked to it in initial release and the many who have continued to discover it over the four decades since.\nArguably no filmmaker capitalized more on the teen experience than Hughes, the writer and sometimes director of youth-courting sensations like Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, and of course Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off. But if all those movies could be called quintessential \u201980s hits, The Breakfast Club is more timeless, even as it unfolds entirely within a kind of hourglass. The almost theatrical minimalism of Hughes\u2019 scenario transcends trends. He shaved off all the extraneous conventions of high-school movies. There\u2019s no big game, no prom, no graduation, no classroom even. It\u2019s a teen movie that says that the teens alone are enough.\nThe Breakfast Club, which turns 40 today (they grow up so fast!), made stars out of its stars \u2013 the core members of the so-called Brat Pack that took Hollywood by storm for a few whirlwind years. It\u2019s primarily an acting showcase. When not trading sharp insults, the five deliver tearful monologues \u2014 sometimes in a literal circle, \u00e0 la a drama club. Like their characters, they had their whole lives ahead of them, and it\u2019s interesting to consider the careers that followed: Molly Ringwald becoming America\u2019s sweetheart before decamping for Paris, Emilio Estevez headlining multiple hit franchises, Sheedy reinventing herself as an indie darling. And who could have guessed that Nelson, who arguably delivers the film\u2019s most charismatic performance (all bad-boy bravado, until we get glimpses of the scared kid underneath), would land a comfy network sitcom gig a mere decade later?\nThe film is an optimistic fantasy of unexpected teenage solidarity. It takes a little suspension of disbelief to imagine that eight hours together could turn \u201ca brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal\u201d into fast friends. Of course, Hughes\u2019 script is smart enough to acknowledge the ephemerality of their kumbaya: None of them harbor too many delusions about their connection lasting once the five are back in their respective social circles. That\u2019s the bittersweet power of the Billboard-climbing Simple Minds anthem that both opens and closes the movie: \u201cDon\u2019t you forget about me\u201d is a touching plea to immortalize this fleeting day of communion, even once it fades with the ring of the school bell.\nThe hierarchies of high school don\u2019t mean much in the grand scheme of things, The Breakfast Club says. It\u2019d be easier to take that message seriously if Hughes didn\u2019t end up kind of reinforcing them. Allison\u2019s miniature Pygmalion arc \u2014 emerging from the bathroom like a homecoming queen, dolled up by Ringwald\u2019s Claire \u2014 betrays both the character\u2019s countercultural kookiness and the film\u2019s be-yourself ethos. She only wins the jock prince by fundamentally changing who she is; it\u2019s a preview of the makeover plots of future teen comedies like She\u2019s All That and Drive Me Crazy. And Hughes really does Brian dirty. However much empathy the dork garners with the cooler kids, he\u2019s still doing their homework as they pair off and make out.\nIt\u2019s a little ironic that a movie all about looking past stereotypes would codify them so much through its advertising campaign. That famous Annie Leibovitz poster, with the cast huddled together, treats each label the characters reject and rebel against as a marketable brand. The Breakfast Club might be the most influential teen movie of them all, and part of its influence was turning the genre into one big game of opposites attracting. How many major teen movies and TV shows derive their tension from the clash of cliques, and the supposedly revelatory revelation that jocks, freaks, and geeks aren\u2019t so different after all?\nYou can see a little of The Breakfast Club in nearly every quick-witted teen entertainment that came after it. While films like Heathers explicitly positioned themselves as sardonic rebuttals to the Hughes school of kids-are-all-right sentimentality, plenty of descendants of the big and small screen simply updated the writer-director\u2019s model for younger generations, swapping the music and fashion and slang, but not the essential spirit. The Breakfast Club\u2019s single day of bickering and bonding bled into everything from Scream to My-So Called Life to the collegiate Community (a sitcom that references the film in its first episode, and arranged a guest spot for Hall a few weeks later).\nIt\u2019s also what you could call an essential Gen X text: Before Reality Bites or Singles or the comparably gabby work of Richard Linklater, there was this portrait of five teens divided by social status but united by their shared disaffection and desire not to become their parents. Not that the Latchkey Generation has a monopoly on such feelings. One reason The Breakfast Club endures where some of its \u201980s contemporaries don\u2019t is that it gets at the essential identity crisis of growing up: The whole world seems invested in defining you (and your future) at a time when you\u2019re still very much on the cusp of figuring that out for yourself.\nYou could say that the kids of The Breakfast Club aren\u2019t just rebelling against the boxes everyone wants to put them. They\u2019re rebelling against the pressure to be anything before they\u2019re ready to decide who they are. That\u2019s the real reason a sequel was a bad idea, however appealing it may have sounded. In plucking a single significant day out of the lives of these characters \u2014 the kind any kid might mythically inflate in their mind, at a time when every emotion and experience feels massive \u2014 Hughes remained true to the embryonic beauty of late childhood, when the possibilities still seem endless because they essentially are. The movie is a freeze frame, just like the one on which it triumphantly, iconically ends.\nThe Breakfast Club is available to rent or purchase through the major digital services. For more of A.A.
