      "summary": "Lumber prices fell over 20% in August and continued to drop into September, reaching their lowest level this year. The decline is driven by a glut of wood stockpiled ahead of a significant increase in duties on Canadian lumber imports. Speculative inventory buildup across mills and dealers has exacerbated the oversupply. The U.S. government is also considering tariffs on imported lumber under national security pretexts, adding further uncertainty to the market.",
