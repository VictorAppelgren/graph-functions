      "summary": "President Donald Trump announced he would send the National Guard to Baltimore if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore asks for help, criticizing the governor’s crime record and calling for a rapid cleanup. He also pledged to make Washington, D.C., “safer and more beautiful,” announcing a federal takeover of the city’s police force and a planned deployment of National Guard troops to curb rising violence and homelessness. Trump’s comments extend to Chicago, where he threatened an uncoordinated National Guard deployment to address crime, prompting criticism from city officials who highlighted recent crime reductions and concerns about federal overreach. The administration’s broader strategy involves increased federal law‑enforcement presence in major cities, citing high homicide rates and the need for swift action to restore public safety.",
