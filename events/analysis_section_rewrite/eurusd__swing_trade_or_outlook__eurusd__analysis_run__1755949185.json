      "feedback": "The draft does not meet the required format and lacks several key elements.  \n1. **Movers & Scenarios** – Each line must contain exactly four fields: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. The draft omits the “What to watch” field in the first two lines and the probability percentages are un‑cited. Add the missing field, cite the source for each probability (e.g., 5S9GJV2O3 for the premium‑phone upside, V7GV8YBQU for the CPI‑driven downside), and keep the probability range 0‑100 %.  \n2. **Outlook line** – The format requires: Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0‑100. The current line mixes decision signals, invalidation, and trigger, duplicates “Positive semiconductor earnings,” and includes a numeric target (4,200) with no source. Re‑structure it as:  \n   *Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence*  \n   Example:  \n   `Outlook | Up | 1–3 mo | S&P 500 2–4 % to ~4,200 (source needed) | Fed policy minutes, semiconductor earnings releases, CPI revisions | Fed rate hike, CPI spike, corporate‑governance probes | 60% (cite 5S9GJV2O3, V7GV8YBQU, UVEQ2SJ0W) | 70`  \n   Remove the duplicate trigger, provide a citation for the 4,200 level (or drop the exact number if no source exists), and ensure the probability and confidence are sourced.  \n3. **Quantification** – All numeric ranges (e.g., 2–4 % move, 4,200 level) must be backed by a source ID. If a source is unavailable, omit the exact figure and state a range.  \n4. **Citation density** – Every factual claim (e.g., “premium smartphone demand lifts AI chip margins”) must have an in‑text citation. Avoid generic statements without IDs.  \n5. **Coherence** – Ensure the causal chain is clear: premium‑phone demand → AI chip margins → semiconductor earnings → tech index. The downside chain should link CPI → Fed tightening → risk premia → valuation compression.  \n6. **Length** – Keep the output to the minimum required lines; no extra commentary or reference list.  \n\nApply these edits to produce a concise, citation‑rich, and format‑compliant swing‑trade/outlook.",
