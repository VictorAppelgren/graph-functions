  "description": "UW professor Jeff Shulman joins the GeekWire Podcast to discuss Seattle\u2019s role in the AI era, the city\u2019s startup challenges, and the push to bring back the Sonics.",
  "content": "What\u2019s at stake for Seattle in times of dramatic change?\n\nUniversity of Washington Foster School of Business marketing professor Jeff Shulman has spent years studying that question, as host of the Seattle Growth Podcast, director of the Product Management Center, and a civic voice on issues ranging from housing affordability to the campaign to bring back the Sonics.\n\nOn this episode of the GeekWire Podcast, Shulman joins us to talk about Seattle\u2019s place in the global AI boom, why the city has struggled to produce superstar startups, what AI means for marketing and education, and how civic identity, tech, business, and sports have fueled the region in the past.\n\nShulman reflects on Seattle\u2019s history of tech booms, noting that past eras led by Boeing, Microsoft, and Amazon created powerful local ecosystems and virtuous cycles that attracted talent and spurred innovation.\n\nIt happened most recently with the rise of the cloud, led by Amazon Web Services.\n\nBut the dynamic isn\u2019t repeating itself in the current AI wave, with the industry\u2019s center of gravity forming in the Bay Area instead. Two GeekWire stories this week underscored the problem: one highlighting Seattle\u2019s absence from the top AI startup funding rounds, the other examining the regulatory hurdles preventing robotaxis in the region.\n\n\u201cWe still have Amazon and Microsoft, but we have not become the Al capital of the world like we should have,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing that virtuous cycle with Al yet, and it\u2019s a missed opportunity.\u201d\n\u2022 Seattle is a global AI hub \u2014 but where are the superstar startups?\n\u2022 Despite status as a global tech hub, Seattle passengers still can\u2019t hail a driverless ride\n\u2022 Seattle Now Podcast: Casual Friday with Todd Bishop and Jeff Shulman\n\nAlso check out the Seattle Growth Podcast and \u201cOn the Brink\u201d documentary.\n\nSubscribe to GeekWire in Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen.",

      "text": "Ken Griffey Jr. is well-known for being one of the most iconic figures in Seattle sports history. Griffey has maintained a strong connection with the Emerald City, from his early days electrifying crowds at the Kingdome of his Hall of Fame career that propelled the Mariners to national fame.\nCurrently, he has expressed an interest in stepping into a new role\u2014this time outside of the field and into the ownership ranks\u2014as a member of a group that aims to bring the NBA back to Seattle. Griffey expressed his willingness to help restore the Seattle Supersonics to their rightful place in the city\u2019s sports landscape in an interview with LandonBuford.com.\nSeattle\u2019s Longing for the Sonics\nSeattle\u2019s identity has been shaped by the SuperSonics for more than 40 years, winning the NBA championship in 1979 and producing stars like Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Ray Allen, and Kevin Durant. In 2008, the franchise controversially moved to Oklahoma City, leaving a hole that remains unfilled.\nThe Sonics\u2019 demise remains a bittersweet moment for many fans, and the city\u2019s pursuit of an NBA return is a common cause throughout the Pacific Northwest. Griffey\u2019s desire to own something demonstrates the extent of the Sonics\u2019 absence.\nGriffey is a passionate sports fan who comprehends how a professional franchise affects a city\u2019s culture and economy beyond his Hall of Fame baseball career. His voice is significant because of his legendary status in Seattle, as well as his business acumen and growing involvement in sports ownership circles.\nGriffey\u2019s Transition Beyond Baseball\nGriffey has recently ventured into various off-field activities, including joining the Mariners\u2019 ownership group in 2021. His move was a surprise as he became the first former player to have a stake in the franchise. If he decides to pursue NBA ownership, that experience could be a blueprint for what his role would look like.\nHis investment in the Mariners was a reflection of his strong commitment to the city and its sports heritage, and the idea of expanding that impact to basketball is a natural development. Seattle\u2019s sports fan base is strong for many different sports, like the Seahawks in the NFL, the Storm in the WNBA, or the Kraken in the NHL. The Sonics\u2019 return would reinforce Seattle\u2019s reputation as one of America\u2019s most dynamic sports cities.\nThe Road to the NBA\u2019s Return\nGriffey\u2019s remarks will definitely exhilarate fans, but the process of introducing the Sonics is intricate. Seattle will be a top contender when the NBA decides to expand, but Commissioner Adam Silver has acknowledged it as a top contender. Seattle\u2019s support for another professional basketball franchise can be seen in the recent success of Climate Pledge Arena, which currently hosts the NHL\u2019s Kraken and the WNBA\u2019s Storm.\nFor many years, there has been talk of potential ownership groups, and prominent figures such as Chris Hansen and Jeff Bezos have been suggested as potential backers. The inclusion of Griffey\u2019s name results in a unique, sentimental and symbolic value. The idea of a loved athlete leading the charge in reviving the Sonics is a powerful emotional dimension for Seattle sports fans.\nA Symbol of Legacy and Hope\nKen Griffey Jr. has always been more than just a ballplayer to Seattle. During his time, the city began to define itself on the national sports stage. Griffey\u2019s desire to play a role in the Sonics\u2019 rebirth places him again at the heart of Seattle\u2019s sports story.\nGriffey\u2019s participation is not only ownership for fans who have been waiting for their team to return for almost two decades; it is also proof of authenticity and dedication to the city\u2019s legacy. Griffey being included in the ownership group would make it significantly for the Sonics to return in the event of NBA expansion.\nSeattle\u2019s tale of loss and longing would ultimately culminate in one of restoration and triumph. Griffey stated that Seattle is lacking something. If he has anything to do with it, the missing piece, the green and gold of the Seattle SuperSonics, could one day come back to its proper place.\nComments\nKen Griffey Jr. Wants Role in Bringing Seattle Sonics Back"
