I said this is the first time I ever [have] seen this, and that just shows how much these guys wanna be here.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s \u2019cause there ain\u2019t nothing else to do, but there\u2019s other things you could do. \u2026 I think that\u2019s important and when you\u2019re around guys like that, it makes it exciting to come to work.\u201d\n\nParsons\u2019 rosy start in Green Bay comes after a summer full of contract drama between him and the team that drafted him No. 12 overall in the 2021 draft.\n\nThe two-time All-Pro demanded a trade out of Dallas in late July after failing to come to terms on a new deal.\n\nA few weeks later, the Cowboys shipped the 26-year-old Parsons to the Packers in return for defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round picks.\n\nParsons got his new contract from his new team, too \u2014 a record four-year, $188 million deal with $136 million guaranteed.\n\nAfter the trade, reports emerged about Parsons\u2019 questionable behavior that pushed the Cowboys toward executing the deal.\n\nParsons will attempt to make his Packers debut on Sunday afternoon in Green Bay against the Lions, but he might not be available due to a L4/L5 facet joint sprain in his back.\n\nHe may get an epidural injection ahead of the season opener if needed to help with his availability.\n\nThe Cowboys open their season in Philadelphia against the Eagles on Thursday.",

This comes after a summer of contract drama with the team that drafted him No. 12 overall in the 2021 draft. Parsons had demanded a trade out of Dallas after failing to agree on a new deal and was traded to Green Bay in exchange for defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round picks.

      "text": "Micah Parsons\u2019 injury worry emerges \u2014 and it puts Packers debut in doubt\nIt seems a fully healthy Micah Parsons was not traded away from the Cowboys last week.\nFollowing the star linebacker\u2019s departure from Dallas and a four-year, $188 million contract agreement with the Packers, Parsons may not be available Week 1 due to a L4/L5 facet joint sprain in his back, according to multiple reports on Monday.\nThe four-time Pro Bowler may get an epidural injection ahead of the Packers\u2019 season opener against the Lions if needed to help his availability.\nPrior to the trade, the Cowboys reportedly had Parsons on a physical therapy program and prescribed him a five-day plan of an anti-Inflammatory corticosteroid to help aid back tightness.\nHe has been practicing this week leading up to home opener and for all the contract drama during the preseason to get to Green Bay, Parsons is likely itching be in action alongside his new team.\nHowever, one source told ESPN it\u2019s uncertain if he will play.\nParsons, entering the final year of his rookie contract, has been one of the best edge rushers since he entered the NFL in 2012 out of Penn State. He\u2019s racked up 52.5 sacks across four years, including 12 in 13 games last year, to give him a 90 grade on Pro Football Focus.\nThe Harrisburg, Penn. native was seeking a new deal with the Cowboys, which led to a training camp hold-in.\nThe trade was a surprising end to the ordeal, with the Cowboys coming off a disappointing 7-10 season in 2024 that extended their 30-year NFC Championship drought.\nOwner Jerry Jones\u2019 answer in the aftermath was that he believes the Cowboys can win more without Parsons than if they signed him. He also noted that Dallas has a priority in improving their defense against the run game.\n\u201cWe need to stop the run,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to stop the run at key times for several years.\u201d\nQuarterback Dak Prescott, who predicted that Parsons would stay in the blue and silver, weighed in on the trade which brought defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round draft picks to Dallas \u2014 and how it would affect the locker room.\n\u201cThat would have been a lot more of a headache and distraction than getting a solution to it,\u201d he told reporters.\nThe Cowboys open the season on Thursday night against the Eagles and won\u2019t face the Packers until Sept. 28."

      "text": "Micah Parsons wants out of Dallas while they\u2019ve yet to come to terms on an extension.\nThe All-Pro linebacker said he personally submitted his request for a trade to Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones on Friday after a lack of communication from the club to negotiate a deal.\nParsons explained in a social media post that he no longer wants to play for Dallas, as the club has yet to contact his agent after Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones discussed a new deal in March.\n\u201cUnfortunately I no longer want to be here,\u201d wrote Parsons, who is in the final year of his rookie deal. \u201cI no longer want to be held to close door negotiations without my agent present. I no longer want shots taken at me for getting injured while laying it on the line for the organization our fans and my teammates\u2026 I have made a tough decision I no longer want to play for the Dallas Cowboys.\u201d\nParsons recalled having an informal conversation with Jones in March about leadership, and that it took a turn when Jones brought up his contract.\nThe four-time Pro Bowl pass rusher told Jones what he wanted out of his contract, and then left the meeting, telling Jones that his agent would be in touch.\n\u201cIn March, I met with Mr. Jones to talk about leadership,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cSomehow the conversation turned into him talking contract with me. Yes I engaged in a back and forth in regards to what I wanted from my contract, but at no point did I believe this was supposed to be a formal negotiation and I informed Mr. Jones afterward my agent would reach out thinking this would get things done.\n\u201cBut when my agent reached out and spoke to (ESPN\u2019s) Adam (Schefter) he was told the deal was pretty much already done. My agent of course told him that wasn\u2019t the case and also reached out to Stephen Jones. Again the team decided to go silent.\n\u201cAt that point, we decided we would allow the team to reach out to us whenever they decided they wanted to talk. Yet still not a call email or text to my agent about starting negotiation. Up to today the team has not had a single conversation with my agent about a contract. Not one demand has been made by my agent about money years or anything else.\u201d\nParsons added that he had planned to stay silent on the situation, but wanted to clear the air because of false narratives \u2014 as well as the public shot Jones took at him during a press conference last week.\nJones called out his star player for missing time due to an ankle injury last year while speaking with reporters at Cowboys training camp.\nParsons appeared in 13 games last season and finished with 12 sacks and 12 tackles for loss. He also made the Pro Bowl for the fourth year in a row.\nHis trade request comes shortly after a Friday report by The Athletic\u2019s Dianna Russini that Parsons was pondering \u201cdrastic measures\u201d and considering a trade request.\nCowboys All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb weighed in Friday on X, writing, \u201cNever fails dawg. Just pay the man, what you owe em. No need for the extra curricular.\u201d\nIn March, the Cowboys restructured Lamb\u2019s four-year, $136 million contract extension he signed last August to save the team $20 million in 2025.\nThe 26-year-old Parsons reported to training camp but has not participated in on-field work.\nParsons is one of the league\u2019s best pass rushers and would immediately help any team\u2019s Super Bowl chances, should Dallas actually move him."

      "text": "Amari Cooper needed about a week to realize he\u2019d rather be watching football from his couch.\nCooper surprisingly informed the Raiders he plans to retire a little more than one week after signing with them, according to NFL Network.\nThe 31-year-old reportedly told the team he \u201cno longer has the desire to play.\u201d\nCooper did not sign during the first wave of free agency and it seemed he might not have a team for the season before the Raiders inked him to a one-year deal on Aug. 26.\nThe signing marked a reunion with the franchise that selected him \u2014 when based in Oakland \u2014 with the fourth pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice, man. It\u2019s a good feeling. Feels like a full-circle moment,\u201d Cooper said after signing. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunity, for sure, and I\u2019m ready to embrace it.\n\u201cI feel like this was the perfect opportunity to show that, trust me, I still got some juice left. I want to show it.\u201d\nCooper then began preparations for his 11th season, but three days before the Raiders\u2019 opener at the Patriots he decided to hang up his cleats.\nHis decision comes after the worst year of his career in 2024 with the Browns and Bills, an injury-filled campaign in which he tallied 44 catches for a career-low 547 yards and four scores.\nCooper battled a wrist injury that limited him after the Bills acquired him from Cleveland, and he registered just six catches for 41 yards in three postseason games.\nThe former Alabama star earned five Pro Bowl berths during his career, and finished with 711 catches for 10,033 yards and 64 receiving touchdowns.\nHe topped 1,000 yards seven times in his career, setting his career-highs in catches (92) in 2020, receiving yards (1,250) in 2023 and touchdowns (nine) in 2022.\nCooper played for the Browns from 2015 until a midseason trade in 2018 that sent him to Dallas, and he then starred for the NFC East squad until a 2021 trade to the Browns.\nHis addition would have provided a young Raiders receiving room a veteran presence heading into their Week 1 road game against the Patriots.\nThe Raiders are already dealing with uncertainty with veteran Jakobi Meyers, who requested a trade that the team did not grant.\nNew England is a 2.5-point home favorite Sunday in what will be the respective team coaching debuts of the Raiders\u2019 Pete Carroll and New England\u2019s Mike Vrabel."

      "text": "The Micah Parsons-Cowboys drama is over. And so is his tenure in Dallas.\nThe two-time All-Pro edge rusher was traded to the Packers for two first-round picks (one in 2026 and one in 2027) and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark on Thursday.\nParsons then agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract with Green Bay, according to multiple reports.\nThe deal \u2014 which includes $120 million in fully guaranteed money at signing \u2014 is the largest contract for a non-quarterback in NFL history, ESPN reported.\nRight as the news broke about the blockbuster trade, Parsons took to social media to post a statement. The 26-year-old said it was his \u201cdestiny\u201d to play for the Cowboys, a team he rooted for while growing up in Pennsylvania, and he was disappointed to see his time in Dallas come to an end.\n\u201cI never wanted this chapter to end, but not everything was in my control,\u201d Parsons wrote. \u201cMy heart has always been here, and it still is. Through it all, I never made any demands. I never asked for anything more than fairness. I only asked that the person I trust to negotiate my contract be part of the process.\n\u201cThis is a sad day, but not a bitter one. I\u2019ll never forget the joy of draft night, the adrenaline of running out of the tunnel, or the brotherhood shared with my teammates, coaches and the staff who prepared me for every single game. Those memories are mine forever.\u201d\nIn a press conference a few hours after the trade, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said there was no deal in place \u201cuntil this afternoon.\u201d He said the trade was in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the team for the present and future, especially when figuring in the addition of Clark.\n\u201cWe can win, in our minds, more than had we gone the other route and signed [Parsons],\u201d Jones said.\nParsons has been one of the most impactful defensive players in the NFL since he was selected 12th in the first round of the 2021 draft out of Penn State. He\u2019s accumulated 52.5 sacks \u2014 including 12 in 13 games last year, good for a 90 grade on Pro Football Focus \u2014 and racked up four Pro Bowl selections in as many seasons.\nJones said the team had an excellent pass rusher in Parsons but needed to get better against the ground game.\n\u201cWe need to stop the run,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to stop the run at key times for several years.\u201d\nHowever, this offseason has been tempestuous, with Parsons, who was entering the final year of his rookie contract, seeking a new contract in an ongoing standoff \u2014 which included a training camp hold-in \u2014 with the Cowboys and Jones.\nIn a social-media post on Aug. 1, Parsons made clear he did not love how negotiations were going with the Cowboys owner and requested a trade out of Dallas.\n\u201cUnfortunately I no longer want to be here,\u201d Parsons wrote. \u201cI no longer want to be held to close door negotiations without my agent present. I no longer want shots taken at me for getting injured while laying it on the line for the organization our fans and my teammates\u2026 I have made a tough decision I no longer want to play for the Dallas Cowboys.\u201d\nThings took a bizarre turn during the final Cowboys preseason game on Friday when Parsons was seen eating nachos before the contest and resting on a medical table on the sideline during the action.\nBut as recently as last week, Jones called the notion that the team would trade Parsons \u201cBS.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trading Micah Parsons,\u201d Jones said on \u201cThe Stephen A. Smith Show. \u201cHe\u2019s a key part of this team, and we plan to keep him right here where he belongs.\u201d\nNow, though, Parsons will join a Packers team that finished 11-6 with Jordan Love under center in 2024. Love revealed earlier this month on the \u201cUp and Adams\u201d show that he \u201crecruited\u201d Parsons a bit. Whether or not that moved the needle, Parsons will be wearing Packers green and yellow for the foreseeable future.\nIt won\u2019t be long before he returns to Dallas to play his old teammates, with Green Bay playing the Cowboys on the road in Week 4 on \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d"

M.M. Roberts Stadium, in Hattiesburg, Miss.\nIn footage circulating across social media, Davis \u2014 formerly of Auburn University \u2014 appears to mouth the lyrics to Drake\u2019s verse from the 2018 Travis Scott smash hit \u201cSicko Mode\u201d while holding her mic on the sidelines.\nKujho Carr, the official DJ for Southern Miss, posted an additional TikTok video of Davis vibing to Nicki Minaj, with the reporter poking fun at herself in the comments.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t help myself!\u201d she exclaimed.\nDavis, a college sports reporter who has been part of ESPN since 2014, addressed the buzzy moment this week on the \u201cSEC State of Mind\u201d podcast with Jason Campbell.\n\u201cYou know what, it\u2019s something that really surprises people about me that all I listen to is rap,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m originally from a small town in Alabama, I went to Auburn, I live in Nashville, and I don\u2019t listen to country music.

      "text": "Bill Belichick has a new job, but he apparently hasn\u2019t moved on from his old one.\nWhile his North Carolina team got off to a horrendous start with a lopsided season-opening loss to TCU, the Tar Heels made more unfortunate headlines Thursday, when it was reported that Belichick has banned scouts from his old team, the New England Patriots, from attending practices at UNC.\nThe news, first reported by John Middlekauff on his \u201c3 and Out\u201d podcast, came with others noting that NFL scouts have had a difficult time being able to scout North Carolina\u2019s players since Belichick got the job.\nIt\u2019s led some to wonder, naturally, if the move will in fact make it harder for Belichick and the team\u2019s general manager, Mike Lombardi, to get players to Chapel Hill \u2014 since they may consider it damaging to their potential draft stock.\nAnd as Middlekauff noted, \u201cIf you\u2019re a scout for the New England Patriots, you are not allowed at the University of North Carolina \u2014 which is funny, but kind of embarrassing.\u201d\nMiddlekauff, also a former NFL scout, said it was clear what Belichick\u2019s intentions were: \u201cPeople get fired. But to ban the New England Patriots is like an \u2018F-you\u2019 to Robert Kraft.\u201d\nBut perhaps it\u2019s not as big a deal as it could be, since during the home loss to TCU, ESPN\u2019s Pete Thamel said that most NFL talent evaluators who attended the game were primarily there to see TCU players.\nIt\u2019s the latest blemish for Belichick, who also drew criticism for handing out blank depth charts prior to the TCU game, listing only positions and no players.\nBelichick didn\u2019t coach last season after not being brought back by the Patriots and, when he was unable to land another NFL job, went the college route, which has been more noteworthy for off-field distractions than anything good on the field."

      "text": "There were seemingly two sides to the Micah Parsons blockbuster that went down Thursday.\nThe star pass rusher\u2019s trade from the Cowboys to the Packers ended months of public bickering over his contract, which reached its zenith during a contentious training camp in Dallas.\nBut there was more than meets the eye going on, according to one NFL insider.\n\u201cParsons isn\u2019t for everyone,\u201d Sports Illustrated\u2019s Albert Breer wrote on X. \u201cDak [Prescott], CeeDee [Lamb], Zack Martin were wildly popular in the locker room when they went thru contract disputes. It\u2019s different, for better/worse, with Micah.\u201d\nThat was on display during training camp.\nParsons reported to camp and participated in walkthroughs and workouts but did not practice or suit up for preseason games.\nHe did, however, eat nachos and rest on a medical table in a bizarre scene at Dallas\u2019 preseason finale in Atlanta.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been GREAT in meetings, but \u2026\u201d Breer wrote, \u201cWhen the cameras are on, or ownership is around, folks have noticed a difference in his behavior.\u201d\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones was not shy with his attempts to negotiate a contract with Parsons through the media, often sharing details of what seemingly became an acrimonious project.\nJones took shots at Parsons\u2019 health and his agent in his signature style, and ultimately opted to ship the 26-year-old All-Pro to Green Bay in return for defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round picks.\nParsons got his new contract from the Packers, a record four-year, $188 million deal with $136 million guaranteed.\nWhile Jones lauded the four years he got out of his former first-round pick, he noted Parsons\u2019 biggest contribution may end up being leaving town, invoking the infamous 1989 Herschel Walker trade that paved the way for the early 1990s Cowboys dynasty.\n\u201cMicah Parsons did an outstanding job for us for four years, and a little bit of the way Herschel Walker may have had his greatest contribution to the Cowboys, what he brought to us when he left could be a tremendous thing for our fans and the success of this team,\u201d Jones said."
