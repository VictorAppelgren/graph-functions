  "description": "Mufid Fawaz Alkhader was arrested in December 2023 after firing a shotgun outside an upstate New York synagogue with dozens of children still inside.",
  "content": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 A man who fired a shotgun outside an upstate New York synagogue with dozens of children inside shortly after the start of the Israel-Hamas war was sentenced in federal court Tuesday to 10 years in prison.\n\nMufid Alkhader, 29, was arrested in December 2023 after firing two shots in the air and shouting \u201cFree Palestine!\u201d outside Temple Israel of Albany. No one was injured, but the incident terrified many of the 61 children attending preschool and the adult staffers who had to shelter in place.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was in Hebrew class with her teacher, whose own child was on the other side of the building,\u201d Rachel Mandel told the court. \u201cHer amazing teacher held, hid and comforted my child. She prepared herself and the children in her care to die as victims of hate.\u201d\n\nThe shots were fired hours before the first night of Hanukkah and two months after the surprise incursion by Hamas triggered the war. Federal prosecutors say Alkhader, whose gun jammed after the second shot, complained about events in the Middle East after his arrest.\n\nUnder a deal with prosecutors, Alkhader in February pleaded guilty to obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by threat of force, brandishing a firearm during the commission of that offense and conspiring to purchase a firearm unlawfully.\n\nAlkhader, wearing an orange jail shirt, told the court Tuesday he felt terrible about what he did and for scaring people.\n\n\u201cI know I was not in my right mind,\u201d Alkhader said, asking for forgiveness.\n\nAlkhader\u2019s public defender had argued for a more lenient sentence, citing his client\u2019s severe mental illness.\n\nBut Judge Anne Nardacci sided with prosecutors, who said Alkhader should face 10 years in prison after traumatizing the children and adults in the synagogue.\n\nProsecutor Richard Belliss said Alkhader wanted to scare the people in the building, \u201cand scare them he did.\u201d\n\nAlkhader was born in a Palestinian refugee community near Baghdad and his family came to the U.S. as refugees in 2012, when he was 16. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen two years later and lived in nearby Schenectady at the time of the shooting.\n\nAnother man was sentenced last fall to 14 months in prison for making a \u201cstraw\u201d purchase of the shotgun for Alkhader.",

(AP) \u2014 A man who fired a shotgun into the air outside a synagogue in New York\u2019s capital city is an Iraqi-born U.S. citizen who told investigators he felt affected by events in the Middle East, a federal agent said in a court filing.\nNo one was injured by the gunfire Thursday afternoon outside Albany\u2019s Temple Israel, but children attending preschool had to shelter in place while police searched the area.\nMufid Fawaz Alkhader, 28, was arrested a short distance away from the temple after laying down the shotgun, police said. He said \u201cFree Palestine\u201d when officers arrested him, according to Albany Police Chief Eric Hawkins.\nFederal prosecutors charged Alkhader with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person \u2014 a charge authorities said was related to his admitted use of marijuana. He could also face state charges. Hawkins said the episode was being investigated as a possible hate crime.\nThe episode happened on the first night of Hanukkah amid rising fears of antisemitism worldwide and fallout from Israel\u2019s intensifying war in Gaza. Threats against Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities have increased across the U.S. during the war, which entered its third month on Friday.\nSpeaking from the synagogue on Friday during Shabbat services, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned the shooting episode, saying her top priority is to ensure everyone has the ability to practice their religion safely.\n\u201cI wanted to come here tonight and recognize that the tranquility of this wonderful community has been upended,\u201d she told worshippers. \u201cAll hate crimes must be condemned and not tolerated here.\u201d\nAlkhader, who lives in Schenectady, which is near Albany, waived his right to remain silent and spoke with law enforcement officers after his arrest, a task force officer with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a court filing.\nThe officer\u2019s affidavit didn\u2019t detail what Alkhader said about his motivation, but the officer wrote that he offered that \u201cthe events in the Middle East have impacted him.\u201d\nA person who answered the door at Alkhader\u2019s address in Schenectady and identified himself as his father declined to be interviewed, but said his son was mentally ill.\nAfter a brief appearance in federal court Friday morning, Alkhader was sent back to detention. He entered the court shackled and wearing a green jacket over his orange jail uniform. At times, he seemed to have difficulty following instructions from the judge.\n\u201cMy English is limited,\u201d he told the judge softly. He said he speaks Arabic.\nFederal prosecutors and Alkhader\u2019s public defender, Timothy Austin, declined to comment after the appearance. There was no date set for a preliminary hearing or a possible detention hearing.\nFBI spokesperson Sarah Ruane praised the \u201cswift coordination\u201d between federal, state and local law enforcement.\nHank Greenberg, a member of Albany\u2019s Temple Israel and spokesperson for the Jewish Federation of Northeastern New York, decried what he called the \u201cheartbreaking reality\u201d that Jewish houses of worship need police protection.\n\u201cEven with this grieving and suffering and fear we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d he said, \u201cat the same time we know we will endure and prevail as we have in the past.\u201d\n___\nMaysoon Khan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

George Allen and again by ex-Gov. Bob McDonnell.\nHis son filed for divorce from Cara in January 2025, court records show. Peter admitted to the affair in his response to Cara\u2019s allegations in her own documents.\nThe estranged couple was hitched in 2014 and have two daughters, ages 2 and 9, and two sons, ages 5 and 7, court papers show.\nThey have a prenup agreement.\nCara is seeking half of their marital assets \u2014 including from their companies \u2014 child support and $500,000 to pay lawyers and experts as she fights the divorce case, the filings show.\nThey currently share custody of their children after working out an agreement on that front on Feb. 27, 2024, the filing says.\nA rep for Cara and one for Peter separately declined to comment. Lombard did not return Post requests for comment.\nPeter filed a motion last month to seal the divorce case, which Cara\u2019s side is opposing."

The Iraqi-born U.S. citizen was arrested soon after and complained about events in the Middle East, according to federal prosecutors.\nThe gunfire in New York\u2019s capital city happened on the first night of Hanukkah and two months after the surprise incursion by Hamas triggered the war.
