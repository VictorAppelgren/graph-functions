  "description": "In total, service will be slashed by 20% across SEPTA's platforms.",
  "content": "Travelers in the Tri-State area are going to get hit with a major change to thousands of daily routines and wallets over the next few weeks.\n\nSEPTA is set to shut down service, adjust schedules and impose higher ticket costs if lawmakers don't approve the funds to answer a $213 million budget gap by August 14. Both the Trenton Line and the West Trenton Line through New Jersey will be affected. A group of five bus routes that run through Bucks County, Pennsylvania's will also be discontinued. In total, service will be slashed by 20% across SEPTA's platforms. If no deal is reached by August 14, the process of adjusting bus and metro services will begin and take effect on August 24. This will be carried out over a two-day period with the remaining cuts going into effect on August 25. Regional rail service adjustments will go into effect on September 2.\n\nOn September 1, a fare increase that averages out to 21.5 percent for all riders will be implemented. SEPTA says they will also be forced to enforce a complete hiring freeze later next month. A second wave of cuts on January 1, 2026 will include the elimination of five Regional Rail Lines, a 9 p.m. curfew on all rail services, and the elimination of 18 bus routes which will amount to an overall 45 percent reduction in service. Additional cuts will be in the plans for the next few years.\n\u2022 Weekend service moves to every two hours\n\u2022 Some evening rides and one weekend slot will be eliminated\n\u2022 Reduced weekday and weekend rides that begin in August 2025 will continue \u201cOur planning and operations staff have worked hard to compress the timeline for pre-schedule change work, but we cannot push it beyond Aug. 14,\u201d added Scott A. Sauer, SEPTA's General Manager. \u201cIf funding is not secured by then, these painful service cuts will go into effect on Aug. 24.\u201d \u201cAt that point, we will be left with no other choice but to begin dismantling the SEPTA system. Tens of thousands of people or more will be left with no viable public transportation options.\u201d SEPTA says they will also be forced to stop all special services, such as the Sports Express line that takes fans to and from the South Philadelphia Sports Complex during major events. According to a study by The Delaware Regional Planning Commission, an additional 2 million daily vehicle miles will be traveled in Philadelphia and its four bordering counties if the proposed cuts go through. Commutes would also be 30 percent longer on two key highways that run through the region, and highway congestion would increase with at least 275,000 more cars hitting the road daily.",

DVRPC\u2019s travel model projects there will be 1 million additional daily vehicle miles traveled in Philadelphia alone and an additional 1 million in the four southeast Pennsylvania counties: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery.\nThere will also be slower travel speeds throughout the suburban counties due to congestion, the study found:\nFind out what's happening in Bensalemfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n- In Montgomery County, speeds on the already congested I-476 would drop from 37.1 mph to 32.5 mph.\n- In Bucks County, the study stated that delays on Interstates 95 and 295 would be 30 percent longer in addition to any delays on Interstate 95 further south toward Philadelphia.\n- In Delaware County, traveling on I-95 to Philadelphia would take 10 percent longer.\n- In Chester County, delays on US 202 would increase by 40 percent after losing the Paoli line\u2019s congestion mitigation impacts.\nThe increase of cars on the road will result in an 18 percent longer commute on I-95 southbound from Academy Road to Vine Street Expressway, and a 20 percent longer commute on the Schuylkill Expressway eastbound from US 422 to Girard Avenue.\nThe DVRPC travel modeling shows the SEPTA cuts would impact the quality of life for people, the air quality of local communities, and hurt the economy as well.\nSEPTA faces a $213 million budget deficit starting July 1.\nWithout a permanent funding solution, SEPTA will have to raise fares by more than 20 percent and be forced to take drastic steps to irreversibly shrink the system, including eliminating 50 bus routes and five regional rail lines, reducing service by 20 percent on all remaining routes, creating a 9 p.m. curfew on Metro and Regional Rail routes, and eliminating all special services, such as sports express service to and from the stadiums.\nPlanning partners across the region are working together to highlight the value of SEPTA service and raise awareness about the impact of the proposed service cuts and fare increases. As part of this effort, DVRPC modeled potential impacts of these proposed changes on mobility in the region.\nFifty-five percent of the increase in travel due to the SEPTA cuts will take place on arterials, collectors, and local roadways, which will have quality-of-life, safety, and air quality impacts on communities across the region.\nThere will also be broader impacts of the proposed service cuts, planners say.\n\u201cThese cuts and the related increases in traffic volume, delays, and reduced speeds, will impact goods movement and freight-intensive industries,\u201d said Ariella Maron, executive director of DVRPC. \u201cWith 40 percent of freight movement across the Commonwealth coming through the region, the impact will be significant. Existing bottlenecks for trucks will get worse, and the impacts will be felt by businesses, workers, and the economy as a whole.\u201d\nMaron also noted how SEPTA\u2019 s proposed service reductions will impact planned tourist events in the region in 2026, including the America250 celebration, the FIFA World Cup events, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and more. \u201cNot only will this impact the ability for attendees, including over one million projected visitors, to get where they need to go, and impact everyone else already here who needs to get to work, school, doctor appointments, and other places, but it will reduce our region\u2019s ability to attract future events, conferences, and visitors generally,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWith the proposed service cuts and fare increases, traffic impacts will be felt across the region by all drivers and in every community,\u201d Maron said. \u201cFurther, it will hurt Pennsylvania\u2019s economy and the region\u2019s ability to compete on the global stage.\u201d\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

      "text": "Traffic & Transit\nSEPTA Cuts Will Impact Lower Bucks Co. Find Out How\nTwo state representatives are calling SEPTA's proposal to eliminate the line that runs through Lower Bucks County \"deeply troubling.\"\nPHILADELPHIA REGION \u2014 Lower Bucks County lawmakers are speaking out against SEPTA's plans to eliminate the Trenton Line because of a \"massive structural budget deficit\" due to a $213 million budget gap.\nState Reps. Tina Davis and Jim Prokopiak issued statements regarding SEPTA proposing the elimination of the Trenton Line and key bus routes in Lower Bucks County, with Davis calling the cuts \"deeply troubling.\"\n\u201cThese proposed service reductions would have a significant impact on Lower Bucks County residents who rely on SEPTA to get to work, school, medical appointments, and other essential destinations,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe Trenton Line, in particular, is not only well-utilized \u2014 it\u2019s also a profitable line. Eliminating it would reduce access and opportunity for thousands of commuters.\u201d\nFind out what's happening in Yardleyfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThe Trenton Line provides service from Trenton, N.J., to Philadelphia. It makes five stops in Lower Bucks County: Levittown, Bristol, Croydon, Eddington, and Cornwell Heights.\nProkopiak said the Trenton Line is a \"profitable service\" that includes the recently modernized Levittown-Tullytown Station.\nFind out what's happening in Yardleyfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nUnder SEPTA\u2019s recently released Fiscal Year 2026 Operating Budget proposal, the Trenton Line\u2014which serves Levittown, Bristol, and Croydon\u2014would be discontinued beginning Jan. 1. Bus Routes 127 and 128 are also slated for elimination, leaving only Route 129 to serve the area.\nBus route 127, running between Oxford Valley Mall in Middletown to the Trenton Transit Center, and bus route 128, providing service between Oxford Valley Mall to Neshaminy Mall in Bensalem, are also on the chopping block. Route 127 includes stops in the Fallsington area and Morrisville. Route 128 includes stops in Tullytown, Bristol Borough, Bristol Township, and Lower Bucks Hospital on Bath Road.\nDavis represents Bristol Borough and Bristol Township, while Prokopiak represents Falls Township, Middletown, Morrisville, and Tullytown.\nThe proposed cuts come as SEPTA faces a projected $213 million structural budget deficit in Fiscal Year 2026, the result of rising operating costs and the expiration of federal COVID-19 relief funds.\nWithout new state funding, SEPTA has warned it may need to eliminate five Regional Rail lines, discontinue 50 bus routes, and impose fare increases averaging 21.5%, along with a 9 p.m. curfew on all rail service.\nDavis urged state and regional leaders to work toward a sustainable funding solution.\n\u201cThis fare hike would hit the very people who rely on public transit the most \u2014 individuals and families who may not have other transportation options,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe cannot place an even greater burden on riders who are already stretching their budgets just to get to work or school. Public transit should be accessible and affordable for everyone.\u201d\nDavis pointed to recent infrastructure investments made by SEPTA in the area, including the $36 million reconstruction of the Levittown-Tullytown Station completed in 2019 and a $30 million renovation project currently underway at Bristol Station.\n\u201cThese are significant, taxpayer-supported investments meant to improve service and expand access. To now propose eliminating the very services those upgrades support raises serious questions about long-term planning and priorities,\u201d she said.\nGov. Josh Shapiro has proposed a statewide funding plan to address SEPTA\u2019s financial challenges and avert these cuts. The PA House has passed related legislation multiple times, and negotiations are ongoing in Harrisburg.\n\u201cI appreciate the governor\u2019s leadership and the House\u2019s commitment to supporting public transit,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that the Senate joins these efforts so that we can ensure stable, reliable transportation options for all Pennsylvanians.\u201d\nDavis also underscored the broader economic and environmental consequences of the proposed cuts, including increased congestion and limited mobility for workers and businesses.\n\u201cIf SEPTA is working to grow ridership and improve access, reducing service \u2014 particularly on well-used and productive lines\u2014is not the way forward,\u201d she added. \u201cWe need thoughtful, sustainable solutions that reflect the importance of public transit to our regional economy and quality of life.\u201d\nProkopiak joins Gov. Shapiro and House Democratic leaders in calling on the Pennsylvania Senate to support the governor's statewide public transit funding plan \u2014 legislation that the House has already passed three times and intends to pass again next month.\n\"These cuts are a direct consequence of inaction in the Pennsylvania State Senate,. House Democrats are committed to working to secure a future where public transit is expanded, not gutted. The ball is now in the Senate's court,\" he said.\n\"Public transportation is a public good \u2014 and it's time the legislature treats it that way. We need long-term, sustainable funding for SEPTA and transit systems across the state, not a death spiral of service cuts and fare hikes. If SEPTA's goal is to attract new riders, eliminating service is the absolute wrong way to do it,\" Prokopiak said.\n\"The elimination of the Trenton Line and critical bus routes in our community is not only unacceptable \u2014it's irresponsible. This line is one of SEPTA's more profitable routes and serves as a vital transit lifeline for thousands of residents who depend on it daily to get to work, school and medical appointments. Cutting service now, after investing $36 million into the Levittown-Tullytown Station just five years ago, is as wasteful as it is shortsighted.\"\nSEPTA is holding public hearings on its proposed budget May 19\u201321.\nPublic comment can be submitted via email at operatingbudget@septa.org or by calling 215-580-7772.
