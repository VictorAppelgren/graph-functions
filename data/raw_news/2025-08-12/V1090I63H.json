  "title": "Academic labels Julie Bishop \u2018hostile and arrogant\u2019 in tearful evidence to ANU inquiry",
  "description": "Liz Allen alleged she was \u2018bullied into near suicide\u2019 at the institution",
  "content": "A prominent academic has alleged she was \u201cbullied into near suicide\u201d at the Australian National University and has labelled chancellor Julie Bishop as \u201chostile and arrogant\u201d, in tearful evidence to a parliamentary inquiry.\n\nLiz Allen, a demographer and senior lecturer at the Canberra institution, gave evidence to an inquiry considering governance in higher education in Australia, on Tuesday. Her claims have also been referred to the higher education regulator.\n\nIn her testimony, Allen also said she had suffered a miscarriage in the weeks following two distressing meetings with Bishop, the former foreign minister.\n\nShe alleged Bishop had targeted her while she served as a member of the university council, including during meetings in February.\n\nThe inquiry has been considering leadership problems at ANU, after the education minister, Jason Clare, referred governance and management concerns to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. Vice chancellor, Genevieve Bell, has been criticised for her plans to cut jobs as part of a $250m restructure.\n\nAllen appeared to give evidence in a personal capacity, after resigning from the university council in April.\n\nA regular media commentator and author, she said since 2024 she has faced \u201cthreats, intimidation, and bullying\u201d because of her efforts to improve probity on the university council.\n\n\u201cI was bullied into near suicide,\u201d she told the inquiry. \u201cI miscarried a much-wanted baby. I\u2019ve lost the opportunity of a promotion. I fear for my job and my career has been derailed.\n\n\u201cI believe Chancellor Bishop is hostile and arrogant to staff. The previous vice-chancellor, Brian Schmidt, kept the chancellor\u2019s behaviour in check.\n\n\u201cCouncil is dysfunctional and toxic under the current regime and elected council members are afraid.\u201d\n\nAllen became emotional as she recounted two meetings in February, when she said Bishop alleged she had acted improperly by leaking to the media.\n\n\u201cChancellor Bishop later got me in a private room with another elected member. The chancellor further berated me, suggested commencing a legal investigation and calling a journalist to confirm I wasn\u2019t leaking.\n\n\u201cI became further distressed with the continued pursuit of false leaking allegations.\n\n\u201cChancellor Bishop laughed incredulously at my emotional response, and at one point blocked me leaving the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was so distressed, I couldn\u2019t breath and struggled walking,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt violated and deeply humiliated. Many people in the building saw my distress. Nobody did anything to help, resulting in great shame and trauma.\n\n\u201cIt affected me so deeply that on the drive home, I decided to kill myself.\n\n\u201cI pulled over to write final goodbyes to my children and my partner. I emailed my supervisors so they knew I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. A call from my husband stopped me taking my own life.\n\n\u201cI was pregnant at the time of these incidents. In roughly the fortnight following, my much-wanted baby died. Its heart stopped beating.\u201d\n\nAllen said she lodged a workplace complaint after the incidents.\n\nACT independent David Pocock sought to table documents related to Allen\u2019s case and the referral to the regulator.\n\nANU\u2019s chief operating office, Jonathan Churchill, told the committee ANU took the allegations very seriously but it was impossible for him to respond to Allen\u2019s evidence because she had initiated a formal grievance procedure against the university.\n\nChurchill said on a preliminary view, a number of the statements made to the committee in the hearing \u201cdo not appear to be correct\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, we will examine all of the statements made and respond with particularity, in writing to those assertions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the university would properly complete the process, including gathering appropriate evidence and forming a determination.\n\nBishop was unable to appear at the hearing due to work in her capacity as a United Nations envoy on Myanmar.\n\n\u201cI reject any suggestion that I have engaged with council members, staff, students and observers in any way other than with respect, courtesy and civility,\u201d Bishop said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe witness concerned has initiated grievance proceedings and it is not appropriate for me to comment further at this time.\u201d\n\nBell, who was on sick leave with the flu, had been invited to appear before the inquiry.\n\nIn Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.
