  "description": "The company says it's working to ensure patients only receive semaglutide produced by Novo Nordisk.",
  "content": "Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock slumped Wednesday after the drugmaker said it expects continued competition this year from \"unsafe and unlawful\" copycat versions of its blockbuster obesity drug, Wegovy.\n\nThe cautious view follows Novo's decision last week to cut its outlook for 2025 \u2014 a move that sent Novo Nordisk stock crashing. Despite that, Wegovy sales soared more than 67% to roughly $3.04 billion in the June quarter. That beat expectations for $2.97 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nStill, Dave Moore, Novo's executive vice president of U.S. operations, estimates around 1 million people in the U.S. are using compounded GLP-1 drugs, including semaglutide, the chemical backbone behind Wegovy and its diabetes counterpart, Ozempic.\n\nThis spring, the Food and Drug Administration determined Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound were no longer in shortage, meaning compounders had to stop selling copies of the branded dosages. To keep the business going, companies like Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) have been leaning into personalized doses.\n\n\"Novo Nordisk is working to prevent unlawful and unsafe compounding of semaglutide in U.S., while making sure patients have access to safe legitimate semaglutide produced only by Novo Nordisk,\" Moore said on the earnings call with analysts. \"As unsafe and unlawful mass compounding continues, the Wegovy penetration within the cash channel has been lower than expected.\"\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nZoetis Reverses And Dives As Its Arthritis Setback Continues\n\nWhy Hims Stock Plunged \u2014 And Why It Could Still Remain A 'Market Darling'\n\nSee IBD Stock Lists & Get Pass/Fail Ratings For All Your Stocks With IBD Digital\n\nIBD Stock Of The Day: See How To Find, Track And Buy The Best Stocks\n\nStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch",

      "text": "Hims stock tumbled Tuesday \u2014 but pared even worse losses \u2014 after the obesity-fighting kingpin lagged Wall Street's second-quarter sales forecasts. However, profit came in above expectations.\nSan Francisco-based Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) reported $544.8 million in sales, up 73% year over year. But that missed more bullish forecasts for $552 million, according to FactSet. Adjusted profit more than tripled year over year to 19 cents per share, topping calls for 15 cents.\nDespite the sales setback, the company reiterated its outlook for the year.\n\"It's never been more clear that we are delivering exactly what millions of people have been waiting for: access to personalized, high-quality care that meets people where they are,\" Chief Executive Andrew Dudum said in a statement.\nOn the stock market today, Hims stock fell 12.4%, closing at 55.52. That improved from a bigger double-digit loss in after-hours trading on Monday.\nHims Stock: Focus On Personalization\nHims & Hers Health is known for selling less expensive, compounded versions of branded drugs. In the aftermath of a Food and Drug Administration decision, however, Hims and other compounders can no longer sell the same dosage as their branded counterparts.\nSo, Hims & Hers is leaning into personalization.\nEthan Feller, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, says Hims will likely remain a market darling. The number of subscribers grew 31% to 2.4 million while monthly average revenue per subscriber grew 30%.\n\"With this kind of growth, and plans to expand business verticals and geographies, the company is firing on all cylinders and continues to define what personalized healthcare looks like,\" he said in an email to Investor's Business Daily.\nFurther, he noted the number of subscribers using personalized treatment plans for multiple conditions has \"exploded\" nearly 170% to 500,000.\n\"That shows this isn't a one-and-done platform, and customers are sticking around to broaden their care,\" he said.\nAn Asterisk In Hims' Guidance\nHims reported about $190 million in revenue from its GLP-1 business, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a client note. This included branded and compounded weight-loss drugs and diabetes treatments.\nAnd the company kept its outlook for $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in full-year sales, in line with the Street's forecast for $2.35 billion.\nBut with expectations for $50 million in sales from the European acquisition of Zava, \"something in the HIMS outlook had to slow,\" Cherny said. The company has said it expects about $725 million in sales this year from the GLP-1 business.\nCherny kept his market perform rating on Hims stock, but raised his price target to 43 from 42.\nShaking Off The Novo Dustup\nHims & Hers also guided to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $295 million to $335 million. Analysts projected $324 million.\nHims stock is also shaking off a recent dustup with Novo Nordisk (NVO). Though the companies ended their short collaboration, Hims stock broke out of a consolidation with a buy point at 67.37. Later, Hims stock fell as much as 8.4% below its entry, triggering a sell rule.\nStill, Hims stock has risen markedly this year.

      "text": "Zoetis (ZTS) stock reversed Tuesday, sinking into the red, despite beating second-quarter expectations as Librela sales continued to flounder.\nLibrela is Zoetis' monoclonal antibody treatment for osteoarthritis. Sales declined in the U.S. amid worries of severe side effects in some dogs. Zoetis told Investor's Business Daily last year that less than 1% of animals who've received its arthritis shots, which also includes Solensia, have experienced side effects.\nStill, William Blair analyst Brandon Vazquez expects bears to pick on the Librela decline in the U.S. and the fact Zoetis benefited from a positive exchange rate in the second quarter.\n\"Our take is that Librela sentiment is already low, so the decline might not matter as much, especially in the context of a total U.S. companion animal beat,\" he said in a report. \"Clearly, momentum is strong enough to offset it.\"\nBut, at the close, Zoetis stock fell 3.8% to 146.12. That reversed from a strong premarket gain.\nLibrela Weighs On Zoetis Stock\nTotal sales rose 4% to $2.46 billion, just above analysts' forecast for $2.41 billion. Adjusted profit also climbed nearly 13% to $1.76 per share, beating expectations for $1.62, according to FactSet.\nSales of medical treatments for pets \u2014 which Zoetis calls companion animals \u2014 climbed 8% to $1.79 billion. That beat expectations, Vazquez said.\n\"Growth in the quarter was driven by broad-based growth across the companion animal portfolio, including Simparica Trio, Apoquel/Apoquel Chewable, and Cytopoint,\" he said. \"Growth was partially offset by declines in OA pain (Librela and Solensia) in the U.S. (but saw growth internationally).\"\nLivestock sales, on the other hand, slipped 8% to $638 million, though beat forecasts. Vazquez noted the divestiture of a key business contributed to the sales decline. But growth was operationally strong across core species, including pigs, fish, poultry and cattle.\nZoetis raised its outlook for the year and now expects to earn $6.30 to $6.40 per share, up 10 cents at the midpoint from its prior guidance, on $9.45 billion to $9.6 billion in sales. The sales outlook is up $25 million, at the midpoint, from the guidance Zoetis issued three months ago.\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nHow Idexx Laboratories Is Riding The 'Puppy Boom' To New Highs\nInsmed Is Trading At A 25-Year High.
