  "content": "Don\u2019t miss the full story from our staff writers, whose reportage is the basis of this article.\n\nZohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who won the New York City Democratic mayoral primary by nearly 13 points in June, is positioning himself as the anti-Trump candidate while drawing parallels between President Trump and his chief rival, former Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nDuring a five-borough campaign tour launch on Monday, Mr. Mamdani warned that the president\u2019s policies would devastatingly impact communities of color and the working class, citing the president\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d that he claims would strip 2 million New Yorkers of health insurance, remove 1.3 million from Medicaid, cut $3 billion in food assistance, and reduce federal housing aid by 43%.\n\nMr. Mamdani used the press conference to attack Cuomo, drawing similarities between the former governor and President Trump, particularly regarding their treatment of women. He referenced both administrations being \u201ccharacterized by corruption, by a sense of impunity, by an inability of an executive to understand that \u2019No means no.\u2019\u201d This critique comes as Mr. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations, has launched attacks against Mr. Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilized apartment while earning $140,000 as a New York State Assembly member.\n\nMr. Cuomo announced plans to propose \u201cZohran\u2019s law\u201d to remove wealthy individuals from affordable housing and has made sharp personal attacks, calling Mr. Mamdani\u2019s housing situation \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d and \u201ccallous theft.\u201d Mr. Cuomo suggested that a single mother and children are homeless because Mr. Mamdani occupies a rent-controlled apartment, though Mr. Mamdani clarified he lives in a rent-stabilized unit, not rent-controlled.\n\nThe political tension has been heightened by reports that Mr. Trump is considering increased involvement in the race and had recently spoken with Mr. Cuomo, though Mr. Cuomo denies recent contact beyond a call after Mr. Trump\u2019s assassination attempt. The president has criticized Mr. Mamdani as a \u201ccommunist\u201d and \u201cnut job\u201d while encouraging Mr. Cuomo to remain in the race.\n\nMr. Mamdani\u2019s primary victory has energized the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing but concerned the establishment, who fear his politics are too extreme and could become a liability for Democrats nationally in 2026 and 2028 elections. This has created urgency among anti-Mamdani forces to consolidate behind a single alternative candidate.\n\nMr. Mamdani defended his $2,300 monthly rent-stabilized apartment in Queens, noting he began renting it when earning $47,000 as a housing counselor. He criticized Mr. Cuomo\u2019s vindictiveness and questioned the impact of proposed changes on nearly one million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments.\n\nRead more: Zohran Mamdani launches anti-Trump tour of New York City, fends off Cuomo\u2019s attacks on his rent deal\n\nThis article is written with the assistance of generative artificial intelligence based solely on Washington Times original reporting and wire services.
