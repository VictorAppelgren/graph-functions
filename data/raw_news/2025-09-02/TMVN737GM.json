  "title": "The already-affordable TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER gets $70 cheaper",
  "description": "The TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER is a budget phone, so it is already pretty affordable. It's even cheaper today, though!",
  "content": "The TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER is already an affordable handset at its retail price of $249.99. I refuse to pay full price for anything, though, and if you are like me, today is your lucky day! The phone is at a record-low price of just $179.99, saving you $70. Buy the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER for just $179.99 ($70 off)\n\nThis offer is available from Amazon, but keep in mind that the discount is applied in two stages. First, a \u201climited time deal\u201d takes the price down to $199.99. Then, you will have to use the coupon code \u201c4YEMU3ME\u201d to get an extra 10% off, bringing the total cost to $179.99. We\u2019re told the coupon will be available until September 10, but we\u2019re not sure about the limited time deal discount.\n\nThe TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER is not your average budget phone. It has features pretty much all high-end devices lack. For starters this has a NXTPAPER display, which offers an anti-glare coating that reduces reflections. This makes it a great display for reading. Additionally, it features a special button called the NXTPAPER Key. This turns the screen into a monochrome one, similar to an eReader.\n\nThese are pretty nice additions if you like reading on your smartphone. They will also help with general web browsing or simply going through your emails.\n\nThe rest of the phone is what you would expect from a budget phone like this one, though. That said, it\u2019s definitely not a horrible phone; just make sure to keep your expectations in check. Remember, you\u2019re paying only $179.99 for this!\n\nYou\u2019re actually getting quite a nice design here, which is surprising for a budget phone. While made mostly of plastic, the look is very unique and sleek. We also really liked the textured feel and flat edges.\n\nSpecs include a MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ and 6GB of RAM. Nothing impressive, but pretty good for casual users. It does have a 6.78-inch display with a Full HD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. You\u2019ll also get a triple camera set-up with a 50MP primary shooter, a 5MP ultrawide camera, and a 2MP depth sensor.\n\nIt\u2019s also nice that you get a generous 5,100mAh battery. Considering the rest of the specs aren\u2019t too demanding, this should last you a good while. When you need to recharge, you can do so at 18W. Again, nothing impressive, but pretty decent.\n\nWant in on this deal? Again, while the coupon is sticking around until the 10th of this month, we\u2019re not sure when Amazon\u2019s limited time deal will disappear. Secure the phone at its record-low price of $179.99 while you can!",
