  "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom mocked President Donald Trump with an all-caps tweet amid a heated redistricting effort in Texas.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2212 California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom mocked President Donald Trump with an all-caps tweet amid a heated redistricting effort in Texas that could give Republicans up to five more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives next year.\n\nMimicking Trump's all-caps social media style, Newsom trolled the president as \"DONALD 'TACO' TRUMP,\" and suggested California would soon go forward with its own redistricting effor to offset the Republican effort in Texas.\n\nThe post comes as Newsom urged Trump in an Aug. 11 letter to stop the redistricting efforts, arguing that Trump was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d and \u201crisking the destabilization of our democracy.\u201d Newsom added that if Trump doesn\u2019t stand down, he would redraw the congressional map in California to counter the Texas effort.\n\n\u201cDONALD 'TACO' TRUMP, AS MANY CALL HIM, 'MISSED' THE DEADLINE!!! CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE 'BEAUTIFUL MAPS,' THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!). BIG PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK WITH POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM \u2014 YOUR FAVORITE GOVERNOR \u2014 THAT WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR 'MAGA.' THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! \u2014 GN,\u201d Newsom wrote on X, imitating Trump\u2019s language in his Truth Social posts.\n\n\"TACO,\" an acronym for \"Trump Always Chickens Out,\" is a reference to Trump's ever-shifting tariff deadlines. Newsom's post received more than 3.2 million views.\n\nDemocratic governors Kathy Hochul of New York and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois have also previously threatened to launch their own redistricting efforts that could give Democrats a boost, sparking a tit-for-tat.\n\nRedistricting is required by federal law every 10 years following the release of new U.S. Census Bureau figures. However, Trump encouraged Texas Republicans to jumpstart the process in the middle of the decade.\n\nThe Texas Senate on Aug. 12 approved the new set of congressional lines by a vote of 19-2, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nThe Texas redistricting effort is stalled in the state House, where most Democratic representatives have fled the state, denying majority Republicans a quorum needed to pass the measure.\n\nTrump said Aug. 5 that Republicans \"are entitled to five more seats\" in Texas because of his 2024 election victory there. Republicans currently hold the U.S. House by a razor thin margin.\n\nNewsom said that he is eyeing a special election in November so voters could weigh in on a ballot measure that would allow for a new House map in California ahead of the 2026 midterms.",

      "text": "'Pack a toothbrush. Pack hair spray.' How the Texas Democrats are living on the run\nTexas Democrats packed their bags and made arrangements to be out of the state for weeks. Some are missing big events, like their kid's first day of school.\nA child starting kindergarten is a milestone most American families wouldn't dare miss, but it's one John Bucy will be absent from this month when one of his daughters takes a first step in her education.\nThe 41-year-old Texas state legislator, whose district includes parts of northern Austin, is among the more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who've fled the Lone Star State to thwart President Donald Trump's effort to protect his razor-thin Republican majority in Congress. He packed his suitcase to be gone for 30 days \u2013 maybe longer.\n\"It makes me scared. It makes me sad,\" Bucy said in an interview about his self-imposed exodus from his family. \"I want to be a part of their lives every chance that I can. But what scares me more is if I'm not here, if they grow up and things are worse off in this country because we didn't stop this gerrymandering.\"\nBucy is staying at an undisclosed hotel in Illinois while he and his fellow Democrats continue to block their Republican colleagues from conducting official business back in Austin, such as the rare mid-decade redrawing of their state's maps that define congressional district boundaries. He said he's still in touch with his legislative staff, who are keeping up with constituents and connecting them to state agencies.\nTexas is a part-time legislature with a $7,200 annual salary, so like many members, Bucy also has a regular job running a statewide organization that provides athletic, academic and arts competitions for charter school students.\nOther Texas colleagues who aren't able to work remotely say they are juggling their personal lives, too, amid a partisan firestorm that is spilling over into other Republican and Democratic-controlled states ahead of the November 2026 midterm election campaign.\nTexas state Rep. Donna Howard said she had to take her grandson along when she left town. Baker, 4, has one parent in recovery and another who isn't in the picture. He's since become a \"mascot\" for the Democratic legislators at the hotel who have volunteered to help watch him when she speaks with constituents, conducts media interviews or when she needs time alone.\n\"It is a village and my village is stepping up to support me with my grandchild,\" said Howard, 73, whose district includes parts of southern Austin. \"I can't tell you how many people I don't even normally work with on things who have come up and said, 'Can I take him for a little bit and go throw the ball?' So he's kind of like 'King of the Hill' in a lot of ways.\"\nTexas Dems resist 'headache factor' but for how long?\nUSA TODAY spoke with more than a dozen Texas Democrats at the center of the national tug-of-war who are facing $500-per-day fines, plus sharp rebukes from Trump and his allies.\nThey have made arrangements to secure extended child care. They have requested longer-than-expected work absences and found new locations for aging loved ones who require 24-hour caretakers. But they also said living in close quarters has an upside: their relationships and team-building have improved with activities such as daily exercise groups.\n\"Pack a toothbrush. Pack hair spray because hey, this could go on for a while and you got to be ready for it,\" said Democratic state Rep. Ann Johnson, an attorney who represents parts of Houston.\nJohnson, 50, participated in the last Texas quorum break orchestrated by Democrats in 2021, when they fled to Washington, DC, to resist the GOP tightening the state's election rules. She said she was more prepared this time, but added that this fight is a more stressful and significant situation given the Trump administration's pressure campaign.\n\"They'll continue to try to break us, but I actually feel, unlike 2021, there's a really strong coalition here,\" Johnson said. \"There's a drastic difference... now the threats are so much harsher, they're so much more significant, and the risk of what we lose if we are not successful is really large.\"\nRepublicans are also doing their part to stymie the Democrats' political efforts, not to mention making their personal lives uncomfortable.\nThree-term Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott has threatened to arrest and expel the missing Democrats from the legislature. The state's Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, filed an Aug. 8 lawsuit seeking to get 13 of them removed from office. The FBI is also helping with the search for the lawmakers, according to U.S. Sen. Jon Cornyn, a Texas Republican facing his own 2026 primary challenge from Paxton and who made the request for help.\n\"A lot of people are demanding they come back,\" Trump told reporters on Aug. 5. \"You can't just sit it out. You have to go back.\"\nIn suburban Chicago, an Aug. 6 bomb threat at the hotel where some of the Texas Democratic legislators have been staying woke them from sleep with a blaring siren echoing through the halls every 30 seconds. It forced an evacuation of the building and took about two hours before guests were allowed back inside, several lawmakers told USA TODAY.\nMany of the Democrats said the bomb threat marks a turning point, and made them think of officials being targeted in other states, such as in Minnesota, where an alleged gunman shot two state lawmakers and their spouses at their homes in June, killing one of the couples.\n\"We have people who are threatening our lives, threatening our families' lives by exposing us,\" said state Rep. Christian Manuel, 38, whose district covers an eastern portion of the state that includes Beaumont, Texas.\nManuel, who is Black, helps take care of his 95-year-old grandmother and remains in constant contact with family members. Living an hour outside of Jasper, Texas, where a Black man named James Byrd was dragged to death by confirmed white supremacists in 1998, he said the bomb threat at the Illinois hotel reminded him of the potential danger.\n\"My family is aware,\" Manuel said. \"We are all on alert.\"\nFor many of the absconding Democrats, these incidents have hardened their resolve to resist what progressive critics say are Trump and Abbott's attempts to change the math in their favor for the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.\nTexas state Rep. Jolanda Jones, who represents parts of Houston, went viral this week after she slammed Abbott's attempt to have the legislators return. She was also embroiled in controversy for comparing the redistricting plan to the Holocaust in an Aug. 5 interview on \"The Don Lemon Show,\" for which she later apologized.\nJones said she serves as her mother's primary caregiver and that other relatives and neighbors back home have stepped up to help, but that she remains worried about her mother's well-being, given Jones' high visibility.\n\"My mother can't live by herself \u2013 that's the bottom line. So me deciding to quorum break was a big deal,\" Jones, 59, who is running for a Houston-based seat in Congress, told USA TODAY. \"I don't know what would happen to my mom if she opened the door and, would they barge in, what would they do? I'm absolutely concerned.\"\nDems hope to frame Texas battle as flood victims versus Trump's whims\nExperts warn the endgame of the quorum break looks bleak for Democrats, even as the national party and liberal activists say they believe the fight could be an inflection point against the Trump administration.\n\"They walked out to stop Republicans from hijacking our democracy,\" said Christina Harvey, executive director of Stand Up America, a left-leaning voting rights group that has been running ads on social media and TV to mobilize its members against the redistricting efforts.\nThe Texas special session is scheduled to end Aug. 19, and Democratic legislators say they're committed to staying away from Austin for the long haul. But Abbott can also keep convening legislators, over and over, legal and political experts say, while applying legal and law enforcement pressure until the Republican-controlled legislature gets what it wants.\nThe governor is adding a \"headache factor\" for lawmakers, Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University, told USA TODAY. Even if none of Abbott's efforts bear fruit, they could lead to the need for the runaway legislators to at least respond to a lawsuit and incur costs, lost time and extra effort, he said.\nQuorum breaks have been a tool used by the minority party in Texas since 1870. Often, the move is more of a messaging effort with little success in blocking the specific proposal, experts point out. Texas rules say the House must have two-thirds of its members, or 100 people, present to move forward. Of the 62 House Democrats, a few have remained behind in Austin, meaning only a handful need to be arm-twisted into returning to the state for a quorum to be restored and votes to proceed.\nJones, the Rice University professor, said the roughly 50 legislators would have to stay out of the state through the end-of-year holidays and into the spring of 2026 for their long-term strategy to prevail.\nAsked how long they can stay out of Texas, many of the Democratic legislators pivot in their responses to hammer the argument that Abbott is putting the two-term Republican president's desires over a needed aid package for the destructive and deadly flooding that submerged central parts of the state in July.\nFor now, it's unclear how the public is coming down on the Democrats' framing of the fight.\nA poll conducted by Texas-based Z to A Research, a Democratic-aligned firm, found that 63% of likely voters \u2013 including 41% of Republican voters \u2013 believe it's unnecessary to be redrawing the congressional district lines several years before it typically happens. An overwhelming majority of 94% said they support funding flood warning systems and relief efforts, according to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee memo.\nWherever the Texas battle lands, the Democratic legislators who have fled to Illinois \u2013 a few others have been part of press conferences and public events in California, New York, Massachusetts \u2013 said they have become a stronger caucus as a result. They described bonding in ways they couldn't during regular sessions, and they believe that sense of unity will spread to Democrats in other states as the Trump administration looks to expand its redistricting strategy."

Isn't that nice? I've never heard that,\" Trump said during the exchange, before defending his recent decisions to slash his tariffs on China for the next 90 days and extend his deadline for a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9.\n\"Six months ago, this country was stone cold dead. We had a dead country. We had a country that people didn't think it was going survive,\" Trump said. \"And you ask a nasty question like that. It's called negotiation.\"\n\"TACO trade\" was coined this month by Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong to describe how many investors have responded to Trump's whiplash tariff policy by buying into the market dip that follows Trump's tariffs, on the assumption that the market will rebound once Trump flip flops.\nWhat the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\nTrump has backed off from some of his steep tariffs repeatedly since announcing a series of hefty duties on imports from most of the world's countries on April 2 \u2012 a moment he hailed as \"Liberation Day.\"\nThe Trump administration has announced new or revised tariff policies more than 50 times since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, according to an analysis from the Washington Post. But several actions were quickly rescinded.\nAfter the stock market plunged in response to the levies, Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for most countries, lowering the tariffs to a universal 10% rate. He initially kept 145% tariffs in place for China, but later lowered it to 30%, where it remains. He also paused tariffs he set for Canada and Mexico, created tariff carve-outs for electronic imports and most recently backed off a June 1 deadline he set for 50% tariffs on goods from the EU.\n\"You call that chickening out?\" Trump said, arguing he reduced the tariffs on China \u2012 which he acknowledged had gotten too high \u2012 after Beijing agreed to open its country to trade. He said he extended the EU deadline after European leaders called and asked \"please, let's meet right now\" to discuss trade policy.\n\"Don't ever say what you said because that's a nasty question,\" Trump said.\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "Texas Senate approves new congressional lines as House Democrats remain out of state\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nThe Texas Senate approved new congressional lines on Tuesday in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort that could aid Republicans in their effort to keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives after the 2026 election.\nThe vote was 19-2, with nine Democrats absent after exiting the Senate floor moments after the maps were taken up, a show of protest against what they framed as a \"corrupt process.\"\n\"This mid-decade redistricting isn\u2019t about fair representation\u2014it\u2019s about politicians picking their voters instead of voters choosing their leaders,\" the Senate Democratic Caucus said in a statement. \"And it doesn\u2019t stop here. If they can gerrymander now, they can and will do it before every election.\"\nDenying a quorum, as House Democrats have done in the lower chamber, would have required all 11 Senate Democrats to walk out. But two Democrats, Sens. Judith Zaffirini of Laredo and Juan \"Chuy\" Hinojosa of McAllen stayed in the chamber to vote against the map.\nBoth lawmakers had spent 45 days in New Mexico in 2003 in protest of the GOP's mid-decade redistricting effort then.\n\u201cWe learned that quorum breaks can delay but not defeat this effort,\u201d Zaffirini and Hinojosa said in a joint statement. \u201cLegislators cannot stay away forever, and the Governor will call as many special sessions as needed to prevail. Our greatest hope is at the courthouse, and the sooner we get there, the better.\u201d\nDozens of Democrats in the lower chamber have decamped to Illinois and other parts of the country, bringing work in the House to a halt for a second week as the chamber continued to lack the minimum headcount needed to conduct business.\n\u201cWe stand in solidarity with our House Democrat brothers and sisters,\u201d said Houston Sen. Carol Alvarado, the Senate Democratic leader. \u201cOur options here to push back and fight in the Senate are pretty limited, so we\u2019re using every tool that we have.\u201d\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nThe Senate-approved map now heads to the House, which must approve the lines. So far, the Democrats' absence has stalled the effort. On Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and House Speaker Dustin Burrows said they would adjourn for the session if the lower chamber continued to lack a quorum on Friday. Gov. Greg Abbott said he would immediately call a second special session with the same agenda, while teasing the possibility of adding more items.\nTexas Republicans began to push for new political boundaries after President Donald Trump\u2019s team insisted state lawmakers, who were initially wary, take up an opportunity to gain more GOP seats in Congress.\nThe Senate-approved map is identical to the initial draft introduced in the House. After that proposal was approved by a House committee, Democrats in the lower chamber left the state, depriving the chamber of the required number of lawmakers to pass legislation. The so-called quorum break stalled the map from passing the full House.\nIn a statement, Patrick said the Senate \"will continue passing this map each legislative session to accurately reflect our state until House Democrats return from their \u2018vacation\u2019 and get back to work for the people of Texas.\u201d\nWhile the Senate Democrats who walked out Tuesday labeled the map \"unconstitutional,\" the Republican leading the chamber's redistricting push argued otherwise.\n\"No one has presented data, or frankly any compelling case that this map violates any applicable laws,\" said Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford.\nDemocrats in other states, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, have also promised their own retaliatory redistricting if Texas passes the new map.\nRepublicans in Texas have taken an offensive stance on the quorum break, with Burrows signing civil arrest warrants for the missing Democrats. Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton have also requested that some members be expelled from their seats by the state Supreme Court. Missing members are also facing $500-a-day fines for their absence.\nLatest in the series: 2025 Legislative Recap\nLoading content \u2026\nIn crafting new districts that would likely elect Republican representatives, the proposed map could also pit incumbent Democratic representatives against one another in some districts, or risk them losing their seats in others. Under the new map, areas represented by progressive Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett would both be under the new District 37, currently held by Doggett.\nDoggett has expressed interest in running again for the seat and pushed back in a post on X against claims he was \u201cdeclaring war\u201d on Casar in doing so.

      "text": "Which states are being impacted by Texas' redistricting battle?\nWhat started on the floor of the Austin, Texas statehouse last week has rapidly mushroomed into a multi-state standoff with national implications, as the Lone Star State\u2019s redistricting battle continues to bleed beyond its borders.\nDozens of Texas Democrats have fled to three blue states in a bid to stave off a vote on the proposed map, which could give Republicans five more seats in Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nSeveral Democratic state leaders have entered the fray, and two GOP lawmakers announced efforts to take the issue to the U.S. Capitol in recent days. President Donald Trump lent his opinion on the melee Aug. 5, as Texas Republicans\u2019 redistricting fight now stretches across at least five states and captures national attention.\nHere\u2019s how Texas\u2019 redistricting crisis has ballooned into state-on-state fights over the last week:\nIllinois, New York and Massachusetts host Texas Democrats\nThe governors of Illinois, New York and Massachusetts are hosting Democratic lawmakers from Texas after they fled their home state Sunday, Aug. 3. The lawmakers\u2019 mass absence from the legislature prevents the quorum Republicans need to call for a vote on the new map, which is likely to pass among its GOP majority.\nUnder the new maps, Texas' congressional districts in the Houston, Austin and Dallas metro areas would be redrawn, along with a handful in southern Texas, creating five additional districts that would have heavily favored Trump in last year's presidential race. By extension, these Republican-heavy new districts would very likely go to GOP candidates in congressional elections, strengthening the party\u2019s currently slim majority in Congress.\nMore than 50 of Texas' 67 Democratic lawmakers have fled the state as of Tuesday, Aug. 5, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered their arrests \u2212 though it's unclear whether and how Texas law enforcement will be able to work with out-of-state law enforcement to execute the arrest order.\nStates threaten to redraw their own maps in response\nNew York and California have threatened to launch their own redistricting, sparking a kind of political arms race between Democratic and Republican states.\nCalifornia\u2019s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, though not hosting any Texas lawmakers, joined New York governor Kathy Hochul in threatening to use his state\u2019s overwhelming blue majority to counteract Texas Republicans\u2019 plans. Both governors lead two of the most powerful Democratic states.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said in a press conference Monday, Aug. 4 that his plans are to \u201cfight fire with fire,\u201d instructing Democrats to move forward with an effort to redraw the most populous state\u2019s congressional districts if Texas moves forward with its proposed map. He said Democrats are moving forward with a plan to put the redistricting plan before voters on Nov. 4.\nIn a press conference the same day, Hochul discussed the possibility of new maps in her state.\n\"This is a war. We are at war,\" she said. \"And that's why the gloves are off and I say, 'Bring it on.'\"\nRepublicans in Missouri, New York and California propose their own responses\nIn red Missouri, a coalition of the state\u2019s conservative GOP lawmakers issued a statement on July 25 urging Gov. Mike Kehoe to call for its own redistricting effort, which would give Republicans an advantage. The governor's spokesperson Gabby Picard told POLITICO on Tuesday, Aug. 5 that Kehoe \u201cwill always consider options\u201d which \u201cprovide congressional districts that best represent Missourians\" regarding the push for a map redraw.\nBut not all GOP lawmakers appear to be on board with fighting one map with another. Two Republicans, Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Mike Lawler of New York announced that they will introduce bills to place nationwide limits on all such partisan gerrymandering. Kiley\u2019s proposal would prohibit mid-decade redistricting, which would likely spike Texas Republicans' efforts and the tit-for-tat proposals from New York and California.\nWhatever happens in Texas, the fight over Congress via redistricting will continue in Ohio later this month, where Republicans hold a supermajority in the state legislature.\nContributing: Phillip M.

      "text": "Pritzker says redrawing Illinois district map \"on the table\" in response to Texas redistricting push\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker welcomed dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the Lone Star state Sunday to prevent the state legislature from getting a quorum and passing a redistricting plan even more favorable to Republicans than what already is in place.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special legislative session, which had been set to start Monday afternoon, to take up several matters \u2014 including relief for victims of the catastrophic flooding, and a new map that Republicans unveiled last week as part of a mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to keep the GOP's razor-thin margin in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nIn July, President Trump said he believes the redistricting could lead Republicans to win five more seats in Texas by flipping them from Democrat to Republican. The House currently has 219 Republican representatives, 212 Democratic representatives and four vacancies after three Democrats died in office and one Republican resigned in July.\nBy not being in the state, the Texas Democrats denied the GOP lawmakers a quorum to advance the new map. They successfully blocked the special session scheduled for Monday, and what had been expected to be a rubber-stamp vote on the redistricting plan.\nTexas Republicans have responded by approving civil arrest warrants for their Democratic colleagues, and threatening to have the missing lawmakers removed from office altogether. Democratic legislators have remained defiant.\n\"The tool they are using is a racist, gerrymandered map, a map that seeks to use racial lines to divide hardworking communities who have spent decades building up their power and strengthening their voices,\" said Texas State House Minority Leader Gene Wu at a news conference in Carol Stream on Sunday. \"And Governor Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump.\"\nPritzker had arranged for a group of about 30 Democratic lawmakers to stay in Illinois this week. Pritzker also said he has considered whether Illinois should respond by redrawing its own map in Democrats' favor, as \"everything has to be on the table.\"\n\"Trump came up with a new scheme to rig the system by ramming through a corrupt, mid-decade redistricting plan that would steal five congressional seats, silencing millions of voters, especially Black and Latino voters,\" Pritzker said.\nIn an interview with CBS News' Ed O'Keefe, lawmakers signaled they're prepared to stay out of their state for two weeks, the length of the special session in Austin.\n\"Greg Abbott has answered the call of Donald Trump, and he's holding this special session hostage to try to pass a mid-district, mid-session redistricting to try to steal five congressional seats away from the Texas people,\" state Rep. John Bucy, the top Democrat on the Texas House's elections committee, said of the Texas governor. \"That's unacceptable, and that's why we're here to fight back.\"\nLate Monday, the Texas Democrats took a private bus to the IBEW Union Hall in west suburban Warrenville. Inside, they stood in unity for their cause.\n\"If they succeed in Texas, they will take this to other states,\" said U.S. Rep. Al Green ID-Texas).\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the Democratic state lawmakers' flight cowardly, adding they should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Texas State Capitol immediately.\n\"We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law,\" Paxton wrote on social media.\nBut Texas lawmakers said they will not back down.\n\"We're not running from anything,\" said Texas state Rep. Harold Dutton (D-Houston). \"We're trying to make sure that democracy is in Texas, it is going to be of the people, by the people, and for the people.\"\nThe Texas lawmakers have the support of Illinois Democrats.\n\"Stay as long as you want,\" said U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois). \"We believe in what you're doing.\"\nThe Democratic Texas lawmakers also said they hope to convince blue states that have Democratic control of their state legislature and governor's office to threaten retaliation and make the Texas Republicans back down.\nBut Illinois may not be in a position to retaliate.\n\"I don't think you can gerrymader them anymore,\" said former Illinois Republican Party chairman and political analyst Pat Brady. \"We are the most gerrymandered political map in the country right now.\"\nDemocrats have control of 14 of Illinois' 17 congressional seats. Illinois last redrew its congressional map in 2021, which Republican lawmakers criticized.\n\"I tell my friends the game has changed,\" said U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Texas). \"We are going to match Donald Trump's energy when it comes to redistricting.\"\nBut redrawing congressional districts outside of the normal \"every 10 years\" rule, as Texas Republicans are doing, is a very rare move and politically risky.\n\"This is bad politics, political behavior on both sides,\" Brady said. \"You shouldn't be rigging the game so you win, you should be delivering results for your constituents.\"\nIf the maneuvering sounds familiar, that's because in 2011 14 Wisconsin Democrats left their state to Rockford, Illinois to delay a vote on a collective bargaining bill.\nThe Texas Democrats are in Illinois at Pritzker's invitation, and he has signaled he's helping them stay here as long as they need.\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who is often at odds with fellow Democrat Pritzker, said he appreciated what the governor is doing but added, \"The South and West sides could use that same level of energy.\"\nThis is not the first time such maneuvering has happened among a state's lawmakers, and has involved Illinois. In 2011, 14 Democratic lawmakers from Wisconsin fled to Rockford to delay a vote on Republican-backed legislation to strip state employees of their collective bargaining rights."

Newsom indicated that California would initiate its own redistricting to counteract Texas' moves, urging Trump to cease his efforts, which he claimed jeopardize democracy. Meanwhile, Texas Democrats have fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum for voting on the redistricting plan, facing threats of arrest and fines from GOP leaders, while Democratic governors in other states have also threatened retaliatory redistricting.",
