  "description": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles strongly criticized defensive back Shilo Sanders.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nAfter going undrafted during the 2025 NFL Draft, former Colorado Buffaloes standout defensive back Shilo Sanders ended up signing a deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nOf course, Sanders is the son of NFL legend Deion Sanders. He may not receive as much hype or attention as Cleveland Browns' rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders does, but Shilo has made a name for himself as well.\n\nSince joining the Buccaneers, Sanders has been fighting to earn a spot on the 53-man roster. No one knows what the outcome of that fight will end up being, but he didn't help himself much during the team's preseason finale.\n\nAgainst the Buffalo Bills in the final game of the preseason, Sanders was ejected from the game after throwing a punch. He was being blocked aggressively by Bills tight end Zach Davidson and didn't like the physicality that was being shown towards him.\n\nSanders lashed out and was quickly ejected from the game.\n\nFollowing the preseason finale, Tampa Bay head coach Todd Bowles spoke out about Sanders and didn't hold back his criticism of the rookie's decision.\n\n\"You can't throw punches in this league,\" Bowles said. \"That's inexcusable. They're going to get you every time. Gotta grow from that.\"\n\nObviously, bad decisions like the one Sanders made can cost a player a spot on the roster. It may not and Bowles could decide to keep him around, but it certainly did not help his chances.\n\nDuring the 2024 college football season with Colorado, Sanders put together a strong year. He racked up 67 total tackles to go along with a sack, a forced fumble, and two defended passes.\n\nRead more: Derek Carr Throws Shade at Browns Over Shedeur Sanders Decision\n\nThere is no question that Sanders has the talent and potential to be an NFL defensive back. He has work to do and he has to keep his temper in check, but there are reasons to believe that he can make a roster and become a role player.\n\nExpect to hear more news about Sanders' future with the Buccaneers in the near future. Bowles didn't like what he saw from him against Buffalo, but that mistake alone may not be held against him to the point of being a roster cut.\n\nFor more on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe 2025 NFL regular season is right around the corner and the Pittsburgh Steelers are now gearing up for their season opener against the New York Jets on September 7. Aaron Rodgers and company want to get off to a strong start.\nWith Super Bowl aspirations clearly in mind, the Steelers put together an aggressive offseason. Rodgers was one of the big additions, while DK Metcalf, Jalen Ramsey, and Jonnu Smith were also all acquired via trade. T.J. Watt was also given a long-term lucrative contract extension.\nRodgers has been fairly open about the 2025 season likely being his last. However, could he be convinced to change his mind?\nMetcalf spoke out recently during an appearance on the \"Not Just Football with Cam Heyward\" show and hinted about the future Hall of Fame quarterback potentially playing in 2026 as well.\nRead more: Derek Carr Throws Shade at Browns Over Shedeur Sanders Decision\n\"I think we're gonna do some special things this year. Looking forward to it,\" Metcalf said. \"And you know, maybe we can run it back.\"\nAfter that comment, Rodgers smiled and responded with just one word.\n\"Maybe,\" he said.\nIt's quite possible that Rodgers could thoroughly enjoy his 2025 season in Pittsburgh. At the end of the year, depending on how the season goes, he might want to extend his tenure with the storied franchise by another year.\nNo one knows quite what to expect from the 41-year-old quarterback. He will turn 42 in December, but still showed last season with the Jets that he can play at a high level.\nDuring the 2024 season, Rodgers completed 63 percent of his pass attempts for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. Those numbers would be a huge upgrade for the Steelers over what they had under center last year.\nRead more: Steelers Reveal Surprising Rookie Injury Update\nWhile there are still some questions Pittsburgh needs to answer at the wide receiver position, Rodgers will have a great group of weapons to work with. He's also clearly excited about his new opportunity and he has been gushing about how much he enjoys working with head coach Mike Tomlin.\nA return in 2026 might very well be possible, but the Steelers should prepare themselves for Rodgers to ride off into the sunset after the 2025 season. That being said, he doesn't seem to have shut the door yet on continuing his career.\nFor more on the Pittsburgh Steelers and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.\nAbout the writer\nEvan Massey is a sports reporter and analyst located in Indianapolis, Indiana who covers the NFL, NBA, MLB, WNBA, and ...

Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe Cleveland Browns finished up their preseason schedule on Saturday afternoon with a matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. Shedeur Sanders played, but did not see much action throughout the course of the game.\nWhen all was said and done against the Rams, Sanders completed three of his six pass attempts for 14 yards. He also fumbled once.\nSanders not receiving more playing time was a bit surprising. What was even more perplexing about the situation is that he was pulled late in the game in favor of Tyler Huntley with an opportunity for a game-winning drive on the line.\nThat decision was not very popular among Browns fans. Even former NFL quarterback Derek Carr took to social media to question Cleveland's decision.\nRead more: Browns' Shedeur Sanders Issues 1-Word Statement on Making Roster\nIn a post on X, Carr delivered a strong message to the Browns.\n\"I need to understand why we don't get to see @ShedeurSanders run this 2 minute drill?\" Carr wrote. \"Wouldn't you want to see your young QB operate in this situation? Get him more reps for the future? I didn't see the whole game so maybe he already showed enough? Help me understand this...\"\nCarr is 100 percent accurate. Cleveland isn't going to keep Huntley on its roster. Why would the team not want to get Sanders more reps in a key situation?\nKevin Stefanski's decision was extremely confusing.\nDespite the questioning from Carr, the decision was made. Sanders was not given the opportunity for development or the opportunity to end the game with a strong drive that forced his name even further into the conversation about playing time.\nSanders is currently expected to be at the bottom of the Browns' quarterback depth chart. Joe Flacco will be the starter, with Kenny Pickett as the expected primary backup. Dillon Gabriel, a fellow rookie, is expected to be placed ahead of Sanders as well.\nRead more: Colorado's Deion Sanders Makes His Point Clear to Shedeur and Shilo\nStarting the season off as the No. 4 quarterback on the depth chart isn't where he wanted to be. However, he has handled the situation with maturity and has maintained a great attitude and has been a great teammate.\nIt will be interesting to see what the 2025 season has in store for Cleveland at the quarterback position. Not giving Sanders more reps isn't something that will be forgotten anytime soon by the fans.\nFor more on the Cleveland Browns and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.\nAbout the writer\nEvan Massey is a sports reporter and analyst located in Indianapolis, Indiana who covers the NFL, NBA, MLB, WNBA, and ...
