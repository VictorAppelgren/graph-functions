      "summary": "The September project44 tariff report highlights a 7.6% drop in U.S. exports to Canada and a 1% decline to China, alongside a sharp rise in blank sailings on key U.S.-linked routes, such as a 49.2pp increase on the New York–Colombo line. The surge reflects carriers’ capacity management amid heightened tariff uncertainty and the U.S. administration’s pending policy shifts. While India and Bangladesh are gaining modest import shares, the report signals that trade volatility could persist until tariffs stabilize or legal challenges resolve.",
