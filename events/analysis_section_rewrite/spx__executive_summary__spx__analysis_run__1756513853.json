      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but needs tightening, stronger causal mapping, and clearer catalyst‑risk framing to meet the 4–6‑sentence, executive‑style brief. 1) **Condense to 5 bullet points**: start with the primary catalyst (CrowdStrike Q3 earnings, July 2025), quantify the expected index lift (ndx +5–10 bp, spx +2–3 bp) and the downside (ndx –3–10 bp, spx –3–10 bp) with a single KNWKYIQ1W citation per claim. 2) **Add the equity‑level upside**: state the 14 % long‑run upside, fair value $482.69 vs price $422.61, and the 264× forward PE, all citing KNWKYIQ1W. 3) **Explicitly link margin risk to index impact**: note that a margin erosion to <80 % would downgrade spx by 3 bp and ndx by 10 bp (KNWKYIQ1W). 4) **Include Fed policy as a secondary catalyst**: Q4 2025 policy shift would lift ndx +3–5 bp, spx +1–2 bp; a hawkish stance compresses the equity multiple (KNWKYIQ1W). 5) **List watch items with dates**: Q3 earnings release (Jul 2025), AI‑tool adoption metrics, Fed minutes (Jun 2025), and margin updates, each tagged with KNWKYIQ1W. 6) **Remove vague phrases** (“confidence is moderate”) and any non‑canonical references. 7) **Ensure every claim has a handle mapping**: ndx, spx, ust10y (for Fed impact), and equity (CrowdStrike). 8) **Keep the brief to 5–6 sentences** (or bullets) and end with a clear risk‑alert: “If margin falls or Fed remains hawkish, the upside collapses and the equity multiple compresses.” This will satisfy the evidence, mapping, and conciseness requirements.",
