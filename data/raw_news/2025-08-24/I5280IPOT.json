  "content": "PROJECT THAT WOULD CUT THE WEST BANK INTO TWO PARTS. ISRAEL'S FINANCE MINISTERS SAYS IT WILL VARY THE IDEA OF A PALESTINIAN STATE. AT 6:00 A.M. HERE IN JOHANNESBURG. HAPPY FRIDAY TO YOU AND POTENTIALLY A HAPPY FRIDAY AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE EQUITIES ARE RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE THURSDAY THAT HAD AFTER THAT HOTTER THAN EXPECTED PPI PRINT IN THE U.S., IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT U.S. EQUITY FEATURES RIGHT NOW, BOUNCING BACK AFTER SOME OF THE SESSION LOWS WE DID SEE ON THURSDAY. AS WE DID GET THAT WHOLESALE INFLATION ACCELERATING IN JULY BY THE MOST IN THREE YEARS, SURPRISING A NUMBER OF INVESTORS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT EXPECTED CPI PRINT JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. S & P FUTURES MARGINALLY UP RIGHT NOW. THE U.S. 10-YEAR YIELD AT 4.2713 RIGHT NOW, BUT OF COURSE A LOT OF THE PRICE ACTION THAT DID HAPPEN ON THURSDAY DID COME AFTER THAT PPI PRINT. BRENT CRUDE IS ALSO IN FOCUS, MARGINALLY DOWN RIGHT NOW AND A LITTLE BIT UNCHANGED ON THE WEEK. MANY INVESTORS AS WE MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW FOCUSED ON THAT MEETING BETWEEN RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TO SEE POTENTIALLY HOW THAT PLAYS OUT IN THE PRICE ACTION OF OIL, BRITT CRUDE -- ALSO GOLD MARGINALLY UP RIGHT NOW OF COURSE, HEADING FOR A WEEKLY LOSS AT ABOUT AN OUNCE. AFTER THE PPI PRINT, SOME INVESTORS WONDERING WHAT IS IT MEAN FOR THE TRAJECTORY OF INFLATION AND OF COURSE WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR FED CUT BETS HERE. AS THE CHART SHOWS US, THE ODDS OF A CUT NOW SLIPPING AFTER THAT PPI PRINT, NOW TRADERS PAIRING THEIR BETS BACK, PRICING BACK BELOW ONE HOLE CUT HIS WE CAN SEE JUST THERE. LET'S CHECK IN ON HOW THE MARKETS ARE FARING IN ASIA, WE'VE GOT QUITE A BIT OF DATA OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. MINMIN LOW IS JOINING US FROM HONG KONG. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING? > > IT'S A VERY BUSY DAY IN ASIA ON A FRIDAY BECAUSE WE HAVE GDP DATA OUT OF JAPAN, WE HAVE HONG KONG MACAU SET THIS REPORT DATA, ACTIVITY DATA AS WELL BUT THE BIG STANDOUT IS THE NIKKEI TO 25, ABOUT 1.3% THANKS TO THE GDP DATA COMING IN AT 1%, BEATING ANALYST ESTIMATES OF 0.4% BECAUSE OF SOLID DOMESTIC DEMAND , BUSINESS INVESTMENT PICKING UP AS WELL AND SHOWING RESILIENCE DESPITE TERRORISTS RUN THE U.S.. THAT'S GIVING PEOPLE THE CONFIDENCE THAT MAYBE THE PB & J WILL GO AHEAD WITH THE FRAGILE PATH TOWARD A RATE HIKE, TRADE CURRENTLY PRICING IN A 35% CHANCE OF A RATE HIKE IN OCTOBER SO RECEIVING THE BANKING SECTOR JUMPING ON THE BACK OF THAT. FURTHERMORE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WERE SEEING IN CHINA BECAUSE IT'S QUITE A DIFFERENT PICTURE. HERE CAN SEE A SPLIT BETWEEN ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE, THE HANG SENG IS DEEPENING DECLINES AFTER THE WEEK ACTIVITY DATA WHICH MISSED ESTIMATES ACROSS EVERY SINGLE METRIC, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO RETAIL SALES, COMING IN AT 3.7%. WE FLIPPED THE BOARD, THAT'S THE SLOWEST RETAIL SALES NUMBER WE HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AS WELL COMING IN PRETTY WEAK, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE ADVERSE WEATHER IN CHINA WITH HEAVY FLOODS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAD DISRUPTED FACTOR ACTIVITY AND CONSTRUCTION AS WELL. THE JOBLESS RATE TAKING UP TO 5.2% BECAUSE OF GRADUATION SEASON, 12 MILLION NEW GRADUATES FLOODING INTO THE JOB MARKET AND THAT'S AFFECTING THE BENCHMARK INDEX IN HONG KONG. JENNIFER: THANKS SO MUCH, WE WILL CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU IN A BIT. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS SEEKING TO STRENGTHEN HIS RAPPORT WITH DONALD TRUMP AHEAD OF THEIR SUMMIT IN ALASKA. TRUMP MEANWHILE IS DOWNPLAYING FRIDAY'S TALKS SAYING A FOLLOW-UP INVOLVING UKRAINE'S LEADER WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT. PRES. TRUMP: WE HAVE A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN TOMORROW. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD MEETING, THE MORE IMPORTANT MEETING WILL BE THE SECOND MEETING WE HAVE WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, MYSELF AND MAYBE WE WILL BRING SOME OF THE EUROPEAN LEADERS ON, MAYBE NOT. JENNIFER: LET'S BRING IN JOEL, A FEW COMMENTS THERE FROM THE U.S. PRESIDENT, LET'S START FIRST WITH THE RUSSIANS POTENTIALLY. WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATION YOU THINK FOR THIS MEETING? > > I WAS SAID THAT BASED ON SOME OF PUTIN'S COMMENTS BROADENING THIS OUT TO FOCUS ON AREAS ARE POTENTIALLY THE U.S. AND RUSSIA COULD COOPERATE ECONOMICALLY, IT DOES SEEM LIKE PUTIN IS TRYING TO BROADEN THIS MEETING, AND HE'S ALSO COMING TO THE MEETING HAVING PROJECTED QUITE A BIT OF CONFIDENCE, THAT THIS POINT RUSSIA FEELS LIKE IT IS WINNING THE WAR IN UKRAINE AT THE MOMENT , BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK THE FOCUS ON POTENTIALLY TALKING TO THE U.S. PRESIDENT, NOT JUST ABOUT UKRAINE BIT ABOUT AREAS WHERE THEY COULD COOPERATE ECONOMICALLY, ALSO POTENTIALLY PURSUING THE IDEA OF AN ARMS DEAL, SOMETHING PUT WAS TRYING TO PURSUE A TRUMP DURING HIS FIRST TERM IN OFFICE, TRYING TO PURSUE THE IDEA OF RESTARTING NUCLEAR TALKS HERE FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FEW MONTHS IT MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY PUTIN SEES TO CONTINUE THOSE OPERATIONS, THE IDEA OF RESETTING RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. MAY BE KEY AND MIGHT YET THE FOREFRONT OF PRUDENCE MIND. REMEMBER AT LEAST GOING INTO THIS IT SEEMS LIKE QUITE A VICTORY FOR PUTIN. HE HAS WON A MEETING WITH U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ON U.S. SOIL, THIS IS PUTIN'S FIRST VISIT TO THE U.S. IN ABOUT A DECADE. IT DOES SEEM LIKE HE'S GOT SOME OF THAT MOMENTUM GOING INTO THIS MEETING AT LEAST. JENNIFER: I'M CONSIDERING THOSE OBJECTS, THIS COULD BE POTENTIALLY DAMAGING FOR TRUMP. HOW MUCH RISK IS IT FOR HIM AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HIM RETURNING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT IS THE RISK HERE? > > WE JUST HEARD THOSE COMMENTS FROM TRUMP HIMSELF EARLIER MANAGING EXPECTATIONS, HE'S BEEN SOMETHING LIKE A 25% CHANCE OF NOTHING REALLY RESULTING FROM THESE TALKS. TRUMP IS TRYING TO RECLAIM THE NARRATIVE A BIT BIT I WOULD SAY HE'S IN THE RISKIER POSITION GOING INTO THIS MEETING. HE JUST HAD A CALL OVERNIGHT WITH THE EUROPEAN LEADERS TALKING WITH ZELENSKYY, THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO PUSH TRUMP NOT TO AGREE TO ANY KIND OF TERRITORIAL CONCESSIONS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITHOUT ZELENSKYY IN THE ROOM AND AT THIS MEETING. SO DOES SEEM LIKE SETTING UP A LITTLE BIT OF RISK HERE. TRUMP GOES INTO THIS MEETING QUITE FRUSTRATED WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. BRINGING IN INTO RUSSIA'S WAR IN UKRAINE WAS KINDA FIRST ON TRUMP'S PRIORITIES LIST WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO OFFICE, IT HAS STRIVED FOR MUCH LONGER THAN TRUMP HAS FELT COMFORTABLE WITH. HE'S MANAGING THOSE AFFECTATIONS. LOOKING TO HAVE A SECOND MEETING POTENTIALLY INVOLVING ZELENSKYY, BUT TRUMP HAS A BIT AT STAKE, OBVIOUSLY HIS REPUTATION FOR BEING A DEALMAKER AND HE CLEARLY WANTS TO PRESERVE THAT REPUTATION. WE WILL SEE ULTIMATELY HOW THOSE TALKS GO AND WHAT HE SABLE TO PROJECT NARRATIVELY COMING OUT OF THIS MEETING. JENNIFER: OUGHT OF ATTENTION BEING PAID OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. BLOOMBERG WILL TAKE TO THAT MUCH AWAITED SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PUT IN. TUNE INTO OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE LIVE FROM ANCHORAGE ALASKA AND THAT WILL BE LATER TODAY. BLOOMBERG HAS LEARNED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS IN TALKS WITH INTEL ON THE U.S. GOVERNMENT POTENTIALLY TAKING A STAKE IN THE COMPANY. THAT'S VERY IN OUR NEWS DESK EDITOR, TALK TO US ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE PLACE INTEL HAS BEEN OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. WHAT COULD THIS MEAN? > > THIS > > IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR INTEL. WE DON'T KNOW THE SIZE OF THIS THING, HOW MUCH MONEY INTEL WOULD GET IN THIS DEAL. IT DOES SEEM LIKE ANY SORT OF AGREEMENT INTEL HAS BEEN PLANNING OUT SIDE OF COLUMBUS WHICH IS TOUTED AS THE BIGGEST CHIPMAKING FACILITY IN THE WORLD. BUT THAT PLAN HAS BEEN FACING INCREASING NUMEROUS DELAYS AND NOW THE COMPANY SAYS IT MAY NOT BE UP AND RUNNING UNTIL INTO THE 20 30'S. SO THAT HAS BEEN A KEY PART OF INTEL'S PLAN TO GET BACK TO THE LEVER -- A LEVEL WHERE ONCE WAS TO COMPETE WITH SOME OF THE INDUSTRY LEADERS, IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENTS INVOLVEMENT CAN HELP THOSE PLANS ALONG AND SPEED UP THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS BIG PLANT IN OHIO, THAT WOULD BE A HUGE BOOST FOR THE COMPANY. JENNIFER: I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I SAW THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WAS POTENTIALLY TAKING A STAKE IN COMPANY OF THIS SIZE. WHAT IS THE PRECEDENT HERE THAT THIS COULD SET? > > THERE IS SOME PRECEDENT, I THINK WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH AUTOMAKERS, WHAT WE HAVE FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY ARE TAKEN A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PARTNERSHIP WITH BUSINESS. WE'VE SEEN WHERE THEY WILL PAY 15% OF REVENUES FROM CHIP SALES TO CHINA. WE SEEN THE GOVERNMENT TAKING A SHARE IN U.S. STEEL. HE DOES LOOK LIKE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS PURSUING A DIFFERENT KIND OF ECONOMIC POLICY, A DIFFERENT KIND OF ROLE FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY AND STRATEGIC INDUSTRIES AND CHIPMAKING CERTAINLY HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT IN US NOT FORGET OHIO IS VERY IMPORTANT POLITICALLY FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS WELL. SO THEY PROBABLY SEE THIS AS A WIN-WIN ON BOTH SIDES. JENNIFER: THAT'S A GREAT POINT YOU MAKE THEIR, OUR BLOOMBERG DESK EDITOR. THANKS A MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING AND GIVING US THAT UPDATE. STILL AHEAD, HERE WHY IT'S RIGHT FOR MARKETS TO EXPECT A RATE CUT IN SEPTEMBER AND AGAIN IN DECEMBER. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JENNIFER: BONDS IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND FOLLOW TREASURIES LOWER AFTER FRESH DATA ON U.S. WHOLESALE PRICES SIGNAL TARIFFS ARE PUSHING UP INFLATION. TRADERS DONNING BACK EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO CUT INTEREST RATES IN SEPTEMBER. JOINING US IS THE COFOUNDER AT MACRO VISOR IN ABU DHABI. LET'S START WITH THAT PPR PRINT, SEEMINGLY CATCHING A NUMBER OF INVESTORS OFF GUARD. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO IT AND IN THE SUBSEQUENT HOURS I WONDER WHERE YOU ARE AT AT THIS POINT. > > GOOD MORNING, JENNIFER. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK. I WASN'T TOO SURPRISED ABOUT THE PPR PRINT, AND IT'S BECAUSE WE WERE ACTUALLY DISCUSSING IN OUR PREVIOUS EPISODES, WE DISCUSSED THAT WE WOULD SEE SOMEWHAT OF A HOTTER PRINT IN JULY AND AUGUST. SO WE ARE THERE NOW. I KNOW THE CPI DIDN'T REALLY SHOW US MUCH BUT CPI TENDS TO BE A BIT LIGHT, AND PPI IS WHERE AT THE WHOLESALE LEVEL WE ARE SEEING PRICE INCREASES. THERE HAS BEEN A STUDY BY GOLDMAN SACHS AS WELL WHO SAID THAT THE TARIFFS SO FAR HAVE LARGELY BEEN ABSORBED BY IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS, SO THEY HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN PASSED ON TO THE END USER AS YET COMING TO THE CONSUMER. BUT THAT IS TO COME. THE PPI KIND OF SIGNALS WHAT IS TO COME IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, AND NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE EVEN A HIGHER LEVEL OF TERRORISTS, SO THAT'S GOING TO SHOW UP PROGRESSIVELY. JENNIFER: SO DIDN'T HOW -- THEN HOW DOES THE FED INTERPRET THIS DATA, IF INFLATION IS TO COME, WHAT IS THAT MEAN FOR SEPTEMBER AND POTENTIALLY DECEMBER? > > I'M STILL EXPECTING 25 BASIS POINT CUT IN SEPTEMBER, AND THE REASON I EXPECT THAT IS BECAUSE UNCERTAINTY HAS COME DOWN, IF WE GO BACK AND WE LISTEN TO EVERYTHING THAT THE FED HAS SAID, CHAIR POWELL HAS DISCUSSED, ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WAS HOW THE TARIFFS ARE GOING TO PLAY OUT. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY ON THAT FRONT, AND THAT SORT OF PUTS THE FED IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN RESUME THEIR CUTTING CYCLE. LET'S NOT FORGET THEY WERE ALREADY ON THE CUTTING CYCLE, THEY PAUSED FOR A WHILE, BECAUSE WE HAD ALL OF THIS UNCERTAINTY THAT CAME IN, AND THE MARKET IS ALSO RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY. A BIG PART OF THE MARKETS RALLY THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HAS NOT BEEN THAT TARIFFS HAVE COME DOWN, SO THE RESOLUTION IS NOT NECESSARILY THEIR, BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THERE IS A SHIFT IN THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKETS, AND THAT'S GIVING A POSITIVE SENTIMENT, NOT JUST FOR MARKETS, BUT IT WILL ALSO TRANSLATE INTO THE FED'S DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A RATE CUT. JENNIFER: LET'S TURN TO ANOTHER ECONOMY, CHINA. WE WERE SPEAKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUE WHO IS POINTING OUT A NUMBER OF DATA POINTS WE GOT THIS MORNING, POTENTIALLY THEY COULD EFFECT FOR POLICYMAKERS GO. HOW ARE YOU INTERPRETING A NUMBER OF THESE DATA POINTS AND WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY? > > CHINA HAS BEEN ON A VERY GRADUAL PATH OF FISCAL STIMULUS. IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN A LITTLE FRUSTRATING, I REMEMBER COMING ON THE SHOW ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND SAYING WE NEED STIMULUS IN CHINA. BUT THAT REALLY HASN'T HAPPENED TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAD THOUGHT. WE ALSO THOUGHT THEY ARE HOLDING OFF TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH TARIFFS, AND TARIFFS ARE STILL ON PAUSE, SO THERE'S NO RESOLUTION WITH DEFINITELY THERE JUST YET. IN THE MEANTIME THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS, BUT VERY GRADUAL STEPS. I THINK WHERE CHINA IS CONCERNED, THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT. WE SHOULD EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE GRADUAL CHANGES VERSUS DRASTIC CHANGES. I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE UP THE NOTION OF A BAZOOKA STIMULUS. WHAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS SOME OF THAT WEAKNESS COMING THROUGH BECAUSE OF, AS MINMIN LOW SAID, THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF TARIFFS AND THE FEAR OF WHAT IS NEXT. WE'VE HEARD SOME NEWS ON THE PROPERTY FRONT AS WELL, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WELL, WE ARE STILL SEEING WEAKNESS OVER THERE, BUT OVERALL I THINK GDP GROWTH IS STILL QUITE SOLID, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO CHINA'S GOVERNMENT TARGET, AND THAT SORT OF OFFSETS ALL OF THESE SMALLER DATA POINTS ALONG THE WAY. JENNIFER: WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHTS AS ALWAYS. THANKS SO MUCH. CANADIANS ARE BRACING FOR SUMMER TRAVEL CHAOS AFTER AIR CANADA AND THE UNION REPRESENTING ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS REACHED AN IMPASSE OVER COMPENSATION CANADA'S FLAGSHIP CARRIER HAS OFFERED TO 25% INCREASE IN TOTAL COMPENSATION IN THE FIRST YEAR AND 38% OVER FOUR YEARS. THE UNION SAYS THAT WOULD REPRESENT A SALARY INCREASE OF 17.2% OVER FOUR YEARS AND THAT MANY FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE FALLING BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. AIR CANADA SAYS IT REMAINS AVAILABLE TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS AHEAD OF THE DISRUPTION SET TO BEGIN ON SATURDAY. COMING UP, WE TURN TO AFRICA. A TOXIC SPILL IN ZAMBIA IS NOW BELIEVED TO BE ONE OF THE WORST WORLD MINING DISASTER. DETAILS ON THAT NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" I'M JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN JOHANNESBURG. THE TOXIC SPILL IN ZAMBIA IS NOW BELIEVED TO BE ONE OF THE WORLDS WERE THAT'S WORSE MINING DISASTER. AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION FOUND THE FEBRUARY DAM COLLAPSE AT THE COPPERMINE UNLEASHED 1.5 MILLION TONS OF POISONOUS SLUDGE INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. MORE ON THIS, REPORTED JOINS US FROM KIGALI. WALKER THROUGH WHAT MORE WE KNOW ABOUT THE SCALE OF THIS INCIDENT. > > GOOD MORNING, WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IT IS BIGGER THAN WHAT HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED OR REPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED ONLY 50,000 TONS HAD BEEN RELEASED A REPORT REVEALS UP TO 30 TIMES MORE WERE RELEASED AND YOU PUT IT INTO CONTEXT, THIS IS TOXIC WASTE THAT CAN FILL OVER 400 OLYMPIC SIZE POOL SWIMMING POOLS. IT CONTAINS HEAVY METALS LIKE ARSENIC, SIGN-ON, AND URANIUM. ALL OF THIS WAS RELEASED INTO THE RIVER AND NOW THEY ARE TOUTING IT AS ONE OF THE WORSE MINING DISASTERS THAT HAS EVER BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY. WE SAW THE U.S. ALSO ISSUE A WARNING ON THE SCALE OF THIS DISASTER, AND THE AUSTRALIAN IMAGE SEE UPDATED THEIR HEALTH REPORTS THAT WERE PUT OUT. WE ARE ALSO SEEING TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL CALLING OUT THE GOVERNMENT AND SAYING THIS WILL HAVE SEVERE LONG-TERM EFFECTS IF IMMEDIATE ACTION IS NOT TAKEN, BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE PRIORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT. THEY HAVE SEVERELY DOWNPLAYED THE EXTENT OF THIS DISASTER. IT CAN DISSOLVE HUMAN BONES BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAID REPORTS ON NEUTRALIZING THE ACIDITY, GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY THE WATER IS SAFE. BUT IT DOES NOT NEGATE HOW BIG AND HOW DEEP THIS -- THE SCOPE OF THIS DISASTER IS. JENNIFER: AND IT COULD CERTAINLY COMPLICATE THE RELATIONSHIP ZAMBIA HAS WITH CHINA WHO HAS BEEN ONE OF HIS BIGGEST AND -- INVESTORS OF THE PAST FEW YEARS, SURELY. > > ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE IT IS A STATE ON COMPANY AND ITS PARENT COMPANY HAD PLEDGED TO SPEND $1.3 BILLION TO SUPPORT ZAMBIA'S BID TO TRIPLE THE COPPER PRODUCTION FROM ONE MILLION TONS ANNUALLY UP TO 3 MILLION TONS ANNUALLY AND THIS IS MONEY THAT COULD'VE GONE A LONG WAY. THEY BEEN TIPTOEING AROUND THE ISSUE SO THEY DON'T IS INVESTMENT GOING TO THE BACK BURNER. ZAMBIA ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THEIR DEBT AND THAT SOMETHING THEY ALSO DO NOT WANT TO JEOPARDIZE. IT'S ALSO SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT CHINA'S INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR MINERALS PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. THEY ARE LEAVING A TRAIL OF DISASTERS, WE'RE SEEING FOR TALLIES AND MINING SITES, CONFLICT BETWEEN MINING COMPANIES AND COMMUNITIES, WERE NOW SEEING ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS COUPLED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES. CHINA NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND RETHINK HOW IT'S GOING TO DO BUSINESS PARTICULARLY WITH THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. JENNIFER: ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU, THANKS SO MUCH.

ACCORDING TO A TRACKER ABOUT .10% OF THE TARGETED MEASURES IN SOUTH AFRICA REQUIRES TWO TOPPLE -- TO TACKLING ECONOMIC GROWTH HAVE BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS. ABOUT 240 WERE REQUIRED. THE TRACKER ASSESSES THE WORK DONE BY A UNIT IN THE PRESIDENCY SET OUT IN 2022 FASTTRACK REFORMS TO FIRE THE ECONOMY. COMING UP, AS THE WORLD WATCHES FOR A HISTORIC SUMMIT BETWEEN TRUMP AND PUTIN, WE SPEAK WITH KAREN YOUNG. STICK WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JENNIFER: THIS IS \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" OUR TOP STORIES IS MORNING. MIND GAMES, ALL EYES ON RUSSIA -- UNALASKA AS VLADIMIR PUTIN PRAISES TRUMP AHEAD OF THEIR HISTORIC SUMMIT DANGLING THE , PROMISE OF A NEW ARMS TREATY. TAKING ESTATE, LOU BURKE HAS LEARNED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS IN TALKS WITH INTEL OVER POSSIBLE U.S. GOVERNMENT STAKE IN THE BELEAGUERED CHIPMAKER. AND WE HEAR FROM THE SENDER BANK CEO AFTER AFRICA'S BIGGEST LENDER BY ASSETS POSTED RECORD PROFITS AND EXPANSION FURTHER INTO THE CONTINENT. IS JUST GONE PAST 8:30 A.M. ACROSS THE EMIRATES, 6:30 A.M. HERE IN JOHANNESBURG. PLENTY TO GET TO AND TERMS OF THE NEWS AND FOR WHAT MARKETS ARE PAYING TO ATTENTION TO. MUCH OF THE PRICE ACTION ON THURSDAY DOMINATED BY THAT HOTTER THAN EXPECTED PPI WHOLESALE INFLATION REPORT FROM THE U.S.. WE HAVE SEEN U.S. EQUITIES BOUNCING BACK FROM SOME OF THE LOWS WE DID SEE ON THURSDAY. S & P FUTURES MARGINALLY UP RIGHT NOW, S & P ACTUALLY STILL EKING OUT AGAIN ON THURSDAY. THE U.S. 10-YEAR YIELD RIGHT NOW AT 4.2713, BUT OF COURSE MANY INVESTORS WONDERING WHAT THAT PPI PRINT MEANS FOR THE PATH OF INFLATION IN THE U.S. AND WHAT THE FED WILL DO NEXT AT ITS SEPTEMBER MEETING. BRENT CRUDE ALSO IN FOCUS AS THE MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PUTIN COMES TO AHEAD IN ALASKA. MARGINALLY DOWN RIGHT NOW AND UNCHANGED ON THE WEEK BUT TRADING RIGHT NOW AT ABOUT $66 A BARREL AND GOLD AS WELL, UP RIGHT NOW ABOUT .3% BUT STILL HEADING FOR A WEEKLY LOSS, TRADING AT ABOUT AN OUNCE THERE. THIS GET BACK TO THAT PPI PRINT AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE INJURES CUTS AFTER WE DID GET THE BRAIN, WE DID SEE TRADERS PAIRING THEIR BETS AT THE FED WILL CUT INTEREST RATES NEXT MONTH. EXPECTATIONS ARE NOW BACK BELOW ONE WHOLE CUT THERE AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS CHART. LET'S CHECK IN ON HOW MARKETS IN ASIA ARE BEARING. IT'S BEEN A BUSY DAY FOR MINMIN LOW HE'S BEEN PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO A LOT OF THE DATA WE HAVE BEEN GETTING. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING? > > WE ARE PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO JAPAN TODAY BECAUSE OF THE GDP DATA OF JAPAN, BEATING ESTIMATES COMING IN AT 1%. THAT'S GIVING INVESTORS HOPE THAT MAYBE THE BOJ CAN FINALLY HIKE RATES IN OCTOBER. SO THE NIKKEI EXTENDING GAINS EARLIER IN THE SESSION, NOW UP 1.4%. AGAIN STRENGTHENING BY .4%, AND THE 10-YEAR YIELD UP AS WELL, PARTICULARLY THE BANKING STOCKS IN JAPAN JUMPING ON THE BACK OF RATE HIKE EXPECTATIONS. FLIP THE BOARD, WERE TAKING A LOOK AT CHINA, SEEING ACTIVITY DATA OUT TODAY MISSING ESTIMATES ON EVERY SINGLE METRIC. THE HANG SENG IS DOWN BY 1.2% BUT INTERESTINGLY, THE PROPERTY DEVELOPERS ARE MOSTLY ON THE UP HERE. THE CHINA DEVELOPERS INDEX COMPILED, BY 1.7% AND HOME PRICES SHOWING A CONTINUING DECLINE, DOWN BY .3%. IS BEEN DECLINING FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW BUT WE ARE REPORTING BASED ON SOURCES THAT THE COMPANY IS NOW MODELING LETTING STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT UP TO COMING IN MOP UP THE EXCESS HOUSING IN THE MARKET AND THAT IS PERHAPS ONE WERE SEEING THE OPTIMISM COMING THROUGH IN THE PROPERTY SECTOR. JENNIFER: MINMIN LOW IN HONG KONG, THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE. BACK TO THE TOP STORY, VLADIMIR PUTIN SEEKING TO STRENGTHEN HIS RAPPORT WITH DONALD TRUMP AHEAD OF THEIR FRIDAY SUMMIT IN ALASKA. TRUMP MEANWHILE IS DOWNPLAYING THE LIKELY OUTCOMES FROM THE TALKS SAYING A FOLLOW-UP INVOLVING UKRAINE'S LEADER WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT AS HE SEEKS AN END TO THE WAR. JOINING US IS KAREN YOUNG, SENIOR RESEARCH SCHOLAR AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY. KAREN, THANKS FOR JOINING US. BOTH LEADERS LIKELY GOING INTO THIS MEETING WITH DIFFERENT AGENDA ITEMS. HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS THE TWO, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING SOME OF THE COMMENTS WE HAVE HEARD FROM BOTH? > > AS YOU SAID, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO DOWNPLAY SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS, SAYING HE WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE UKRAINIANS ON TERRITORY CONCESSIONS, BUT CLEARLY HE HAS MOVED THE CONVERSATION EXACTLY TO THAT POINT, SO THAT PLAYS INTO PUTIN'S KEY WISHES FOR WHAT HE HAS LEARNED TO ACHIEVE IN THIS WAR, AND SO CERTAINLY NOW THE AGENDA IS MORE FAVORABLE TO WHAT PUTIN WANTS. THE WAY THAT TRUMP MAY WANT TO ALSO DOWNPLAY THE -- ON WHICH HE COULD DO IN TERMS OF PUTTING MORE RUSSIA -- MORE PRESSURE ON RUSSIA, IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT PROBABLY DOESN'T WANT TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO ACT ON. HE HAS A WAY TO SORT OF NEGOTIATE OUT OF THAT ARE TO MAKE IT NOT THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, THAT IS PROBABLY WHERE HE WILL LEAD. JENNIFER: IF THIS IS NOT THE MEETING TO PAY ATTENTION TO, IF ARE NOT GOING TO SEE ANY TANGIBLE TAKEAWAYS HERE, WHAT ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION TO, THEN? > > I THINK WHAT IS REALLY COMING OUT OF THIS MEETING IS THAT IT IS A FACE-TO-FACE BETWEEN THESE TWO LEADERS, AND TRUMP PROBABLY WANTED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION, THEIR DIALOGUE. HE PLAYS IT AS IF HE WANTS TO READ THE TEMPERATURE, IS FOOD AND BEING MORE CONCESSIONARY TO HIM OR AGREEABLE IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATION? BUT WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND IS AT A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER STATES ARE TRYING TO MEASURE HOW THE UNITED STATES IS DEALING WITH CONFLICT AND THE MESSAGE THAT HAS COME OUT IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS MEETING IS ESSENTIALLY THAT WRIGHT MAKES RIGHT, THAT OCCUPATION OF TERRITORY IS MAYBE ILLEGAL BUT ACCEPTABLE, AND THAT SINCE A CLEAR MESSAGE TO MANY OTHER STATES WHO ARE OF COURSE GOING TO BE APPREHENSIVE AND WORRIED ABOUT THE STANCE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY BE TAKING. JENNIFER: WHAT COULD IT MEAN THEN FOR POTENTIAL FOLLOW-ON MEETINGS WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS AND? ZELENSKYY? > > THE NEXT MEETING WHICH US TENTATIVELY WOULD BE BETWEEN MEETING -- BUT POTENT AND ZELENSKYY -- BY PUTIN AND ZELENSKYY WOULD BE SOMETHING TOWARD A CEASE-FIRE, AND PROBABLY SOME NEGOTIATION ABOUT TERRITORIAL CONCESSIONS. AND THAT IS NOT THE CONVERSATION THAT PRESIDENT LINSKY HAS WANTED TO HAVE, BUT AS I SAID, I THINK TRUMP IS MOVING THE AGENDA IN THAT DIRECTION. JENNIFER: KAREN, WE HAVE A BIG TAKE FROM OUR TEAM ABOUT JUST THE STATE OF THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AND HOW A LOT OF THE PRICE ACTION IN THE OIL SECTOR HAS AFFECTED THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY. DOES THIS POTENTIALLY, THE MEETING PLAY OUT IN THE ENERGY SECTOR AT ALL, IN YOUR OPINION? > > ABSOLUTELY. WE STILL HAVE THE PRICE CAP ON RUSSIAN OIL AT $60 A BARREL. IT'S NOT SUCH A PENALTY ANYMORE BUT THAT REVENUE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO MEET ITS SPENDING OBLIGATIONS. THEY ARE DEALING WITH VERY HIGH INFLATION RATES AND THIS IS JUST THE LIFELINE. TALK OF SECONDARY SANCTIONS PARTICULARLY ON INDIA AND THE AMOUNT OF RUSSIAN EXPORTS WHICH ARE GOING TO BOTH INDIA AND CHINA ARE A BIG CONCERN. AND THAT DYSFUNCTION, EVEN THOUGH THE MARKET IS QUITE WELL SUPPLIED, IF WE CREATE A SURPRISE, IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ADJUST WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, SO THE TALK OF TARIFFS AGAINST INDIA IN PARTICULAR, THE 50% RATE WOULD GO INTO EFFECT BY AUGUST 27, IS TIED TO THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP AND IS A PUNISHMENT FOR INDIA'S PURCHASES OF DISCOUNTED RUSSIAN OIL. SO RUSSIA NEEDS THE PRICE CAP TO STAY WHERE IT IS AND NOT GO LOWER, THE PURCHASERS OF RUSSIAN OIL, RUSSIA AND CHINA IN PARTICULAR, NEED THAT OIL TO STAY IN PLACE AND AT LEAST IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A DISRUPTION, TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND HAVE A BIT OF A LONGER TIMELINE TO DEAL WITH IT. JENNIFER: KAREN YOUNG, THANKS SO MUCH FOR STAYING UP LATE AND BRINGING US URINALYSIS THERE. BLOOMBERG WILL TAKE YOU TO THAT MUCH AWAITED SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PUTIN. TUNE INTO OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE BY FROM ANCHORAGE, ALASKA, LATER TODAY. ISRAEL SAYS IT IS PLANNING TO EXPAND SETTLEMENTS INTO 3000 ACRES OF THE WEST BANK, EFFECTIVELY SPLITTING THE ENCLAVE. THE MOVE DEFIES RESTAURANT CALLS TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD AND TARGETS IN AREA LONG EXCLUDED FROM SETTLEMENT PLANS. SETTLEMENT EXPANSION IS WIDELY SEEN AS A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. JOINING US IS DAN WILLIAMS IN JERUSALEM. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS PLAN, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING A LOT OF THE RHETORIC THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT ANY SORT OF EXPANSION IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. > > THE SIGNIFICANCE IS MAINLY IN THE TIMING, WHERE A MONTH AWAY FROM THE ANNUAL U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW YORK. ON THE SIDELINES OF THAT WE COULD BE A CENTRAL ISSUE, NUMBER OF WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE POISED TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD. THIS WOULD BUT THE ACCEPTED CONVENTION GOING BACK DECADES, THE PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD WOULD HAVE TO COME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL. THOSE WESTERN COUNTRIES SAY THAT DOING THIS, THEY MIGHT DO IT IN ORDER TO PRESSURE ISRAEL TO CEASE-FIRE IN THE GAZA STRIP. THERE'S MUCH CONSTERNATION IN GAZA, IT ANNOUNCED BUILDING IN THIS AREA OF THE WEST BANK THAT PLAYERS HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR 20 YEARS THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVINCE ISRAEL TO ABSTAIN FROM BUILDING. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A DECLARATION OF INTENT, THE ISRAELI MINISTER SAID THIS WOULD VERY THE IDEA OF A PALESTINIAN STATE, AND THE UNITED STATES, UNLIKE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS, THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION APPEARS TO BE ON SITE WITH THIS. THERE WAS NO RUSH TO CONDEMN THIS OR TRY TO CURB ISRAELI MEASURES. WHAT WE HAVE IS A TASSEL OVER THE IDEA OF PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD NOW BEING PLAYED OUT ON THE GROUND. JENNIFER: DAN WILLIAMS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AND FOR YOUR REPORTING. THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT HAS DISTANCED ITSELF FROM REMARKS BY THE COUNTRY'S TOP GENERAL DURING A VISIT TO IRAN. THE NATIONAL DEFENSE FORCE CHIEF WAS QUOTED IN LOCAL MEDIA CRITICIZING ISRAEL AND FORCING SOLIDARITY WITH THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC. HE COMES AFTER TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A NEW TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.S.. LET'S BRING IN OUR ECONOMY AND GOVERNMENT REPORTED HERE IN JOHANNESBURG. THANKS MUCH FOR JOINING US. TALK ABOUT HOW THESE COMMENTS COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT WHERE SOUTH AFRICA IS RIGHT NOW IN A LOT OF ITS BILATERAL RELATIONS. > > IS IMPORTANT TO PREFACE THIS BY SAYING THAT SOUTH AFRICA AND IRAN SHOULD REVIEW ITS APPROACHES. THE COMMENTS, AND A VERY SENSITIVE TIME, GIVEN ALREADY STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SOUTH AFRICA. SO THEY'RE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE FOR A BASIC TRADE DEAL TO LOWER THE TARIFF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS IMPOSED ON ITS GOODS THAT IT SENDS TO THE U.S., AND ANY CLOSENESS PERCEIVED BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND IRAN COULD ACTUALLY HARDEN THE STANCE OF THE U.S. AGAIN SEE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS. AND MAKE IT HARDER TO GET SOME RELIEF AND IS SEEN AS HAVING REALLY ADVERSE IMPACTS ON SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. JENNIFER: ARE WE SEEING ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT REASSURING SOME INTERNATIONAL LEADERS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT THESE COMMENTS AND WONDERING WHERE SOUTH AFRICA STANDS ON THEIR FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA. > > THE FIRST STATEMENT IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THESE COMMENTS WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF SPECIAL RELATIONS SHOULD DISTANCE ITSELF FIRST AND TO ALSO ASSERT THAT IS NOT THE OFFICIAL POLICY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY OR THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT. A PRESS BRIEFING WAS HELD THAT SAID THAT OBVIOUSLY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ESCALATING EFFORTS TO ENGAGE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN NEGOTIATIONS THAT HE SAID IS A DAILY EXERCISE AND TRYING TO RESET NOT ONLY CRITICAL RELATIONS BUT ALSO TRADE RELATIONS. JENNIFER: IT'S A PRECARIOUS POSITION SOUTH AFRICA IS IN. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS ALWAYS. AXIOS IS REPORTING THE DIRECTOR OF ISRAEL'S MOSSAD SPY AGENCY VISITED QATAR ON THURSDAY, MEETING THE PROMINENCE OF TALKS ON A GAZA HOSTAGE AND CEASE-FIRE DEAL. IT MARKS A HIGH SEVERAL TALKS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE MEDIATOR SINCE NEGOTIATIONS BROKE DOWN AGAIN THREE WEEKS AGO. COMING UP, SAUDI ARABIA SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND CUTS THE VALUE OF MAJOR PROJECTS BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE WILL TELL YOU WHY, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" I'M JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN JOHANNESBURG. SAUDI ARABIA SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND CUT THE VALUE MAJOR PROJECTS BY EIGHT GOING DOLLARS LAST YEAR, HIGHLIGHTING THE CHALLENGES IS THE KINGDOM DIVERSIFIES AWAY FROM OIL. THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT FUND VALUED HIS PROJECTS AT 64 POINT $2 BILLION AT THE END OF 2024 BUT 12% LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. WALK US THROUGH JUST WHERE THE PIF WAS AT IN TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE LAST YEAR. > > GOOD MORNING. YOU MENTIONED THE FIRST ITEM IN THE REPORT, A 12% CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE VALUE OF THE PROJECT, JUST OVER 64 BILLION DOLLARS. TWO OTHER ITEMS WORTHY OF NOTING IN THIS REPORT ARE THE AUM BY THE END OF LAST YEAR WHICH INCREASED $913 BILLION, BUT IT'S ALSO WORTHY TO MENTION HERE THAT THIS FIGURE IS BY THE END OF 2024. RIGHT NOW WE KNOW IT IS IN FACT PROBABLY OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS, SO THAT FALLS UNDER THE PIF TARGETS OF REACHING AND AUM OF 2.67 TRILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF THE DECADE. THEY HAVE TAKEN UP THIS GOAL FROM $1.87 TRILLION BY 2030. SOMETHING ELSE WORTHY OF MENTIONING IS THE ANNUAL -- ANNUALIZED RETURN THAT DROPPED BY THE END OF 2024 COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE. SO OVERALL WE KNOW THE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT HAVE INCREASED BY THE END OF LAST YEAR AND WE WANT TO MENTION THAT MOSTLY THE INCREASE WAS BOOSTED BY DOMESTIC SPENDING. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE CROWN PRINCE AND THE GOVERNOR SAID THEY ARE WRONG TO FOCUS MORE ON DOMESTIC SPENDING IN SAUDI ARABIA INSTEAD OF INTERNATIONAL ALLOCATIONS. JENNIFER: SO IT'S A BIT OF A MAKES PICTURE, BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR VISION 2030 AND SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS UNDERTAKEN? > > WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CONSTITUENTS HERE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD PICTURE. WE REPORTED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT A BIG PART OF THE CITY WITHIN THE DESERT, WE REPORTED THAT PROJECT IS GETTING A STRATEGIC REVIEW. THE PIF HAD SENT CONSULTANTS TO ASK ABOUT THE STATE OF THE MIND AND IF IT IS DOABLE IN ITS CURRENT FORM. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT AN. WE TALKED TO ECONOMISTS AND PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT SAUDI ARABIA VERY CLOSELY, THAT THE SPINNING IS A GOOD THING. WE SAW IN THE SECOND QUARTER BUDGET IN SAUDI ARABIA WHICH CAME OUT A FEW DAYS AGO THAT THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS REDUCED ITS SPENDING. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE PROJECTS THEY ARE ASSESSING WHERE THEY ARE SPENDING AS MUCH AS THEY HAD ENVISION IN THE BEGINNING AND THE SPENDING DECREASE OF THE SAUDI BUDGET HAS IN FACT THAT OUR TEAM TO REDUCE THE FISCAL BREAKEVEN OIL PRICE TO $94 A BARREL FOR THIS QUARTER FROM PREVIOUSLY. JENNIFER: FASCINATING, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING. SAUDI ARABIA'S FLAG CARRIER IS IN TALKS WITH SPACEX TO INSTALL THE STARLINK INTERNET SERVICE. BLOOMBERG HAS LEARNED THAT SAUDI IS FINALIZING A DEAL TO ROLL OUT THE SERVICE ACROSS ITS FLEET OF MORE THAN 140 AIRCRAFT. A DEAL WOULD GIVE SPACEX A FOOTHOLD IN THE GULF'S BIGGEST ECONOMY AND REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE FOR STARLINK AS IT PUSHES FURTHER INTO THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR IN-FLIGHT CONNECTIVITY. COMING UP AFRICA'S BIGGEST LENDER BY ASSETS, STANDARD BANK POSTED REFERENCE -- RECORD PROFIT AND FLAGGED AN EXPANSION FURTHER INTO THE CONTINENT. MY CONVERSATION WITH THE CEO, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JENNIFER: WELCOME BACK TO \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" I'M JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN JOHANNESBURG. NIGERIA SAID TO REPORT IS JULY CPI PRINT LATER TODAY, ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS, INFLATION IS SEEN COOLING FURTHER TO 21.6 PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR. THE MODERATION AND CONSUMER PRICES IS SEEN PARTLY DUE TO A PULLBACK IN INTERNATIONAL OIL PRICES. AFRICA'S BIGGER -- BIGGEST LENDER ASSETS HAS POSTED RECORD PROFIT AND FLAGGED AN EXPANSION FURTHER INTO THE CONTINENT. I SPOKE WITH THE CEO TOLD ME HE IS CLOSELY WATCHING GLOBAL GEOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS. > > THE SITUATION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SOUTH AFRICA IS FRAUGHT , BUT WE ARE AWARE THAT AUTHORITIES ARE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER. I THINK THE U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE MADE CLEAR TO SOUTH AFRICAN AUTHORITIES, WE UNDERSTAND THEY ARE ENGAGED ON TRADE ISSUES, GEO-ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES AND OF COURSE ISSUES PECULIAR TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN SITUATION SUCH AS EXPLORATION WITHOUT COMPENSATION AND SO FORTH. MY UNDERSTANDING IS RELEVANT PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER. WE LIVE DAY BY DAY, WE TRY THE BEST WE CAN GIVEN THE INFORMATION WE HAVE. I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT WE ARE ENGAGED WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE G20, THE FINANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE, WITH 169 MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND FOLKS ARE ENGAGED, PEOPLE FROM AMERICA ARE PARTICIPATING IN MAKING A CONTRIBUTION. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AMERICAN AUTHORITIES WILL DECIDE BETWEEN NOW IN THE END OF THE YEAR, BUT WE HOPE AND PRAY THERE WILL BE CONVERGENCE WITH THE AUTHORITIES. BUT WE HOPE FOR THE BEST AND WE PLAN FOR THE WORST. JENNIFER: BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, I HAVE TO ASK WHAT DECISION THAT WAS MADE TODAY OR PRIOR TO THAT, THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF YOUR RETIREMENT IN 2027. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH JUST IN THE TWO YEARS UNTIL THAT TIME? > > WE WANT TO REACH EQUITY BETWEEN 18% AND 22% AND EARNINGS-PER-SHARE WITHIN THE TARGET RANGE ANNOUNCED. BUT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME WE WANT TO ACHIEVE IS RETURN ON EQUITY THAT IS IN THE UPPER RANGE OF 18% AND 22%. JENNIFER: A DIPLOMATIC ANSWER THERE, THE CEO OF STANDARD BANK. WE WILL TAKE YOU TO THAT MUCH AWAITED SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PUTIN, TUNING INTO OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE LIVE FROM ANCHORAGE, ALASKA, LATER TODAY. FOR NOW, THAT'S WHERE WE LEAVE IT FOR \"HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA.\" I'M JENNIFER ZABASAJJA IN JOHANNESBURG. STICK WITH US FOR DAYBREAK EUROPE, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a",
