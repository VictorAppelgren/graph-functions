  "title": "China\u2019s And Europe\u2019s Economic Growth: Potential Vs. Policy Limitations",
  "description": "China has enjoyed super-charged growth but that pace will very likely slow down. The country\u2019s potential is so high, though, that we shouldn\u2019t be too pessimistic.",
  "content": "China has enjoyed phenomenal super-charged growth in recent decades, but that pace will very likely slow down. Arnold Kling compiles and comments on several perspectives about the country\u2019s prospects. Reasonable economic growth theory tells us that China\u2019s growth rate will slow but remain above that of developed countries. Xi Jinping\u2019s policies will limit future growth, but the country\u2019s potential is so much higher than current activity that we shouldn\u2019t be too pessimistic.\n\nChina\u2019s per capita income, translated into U.S. dollars, was just 2.5% of the average of the G-7 countries back in 1980. Although China\u2019s growth rate has slowed in recent years, so has the G-7\u2019s. China has plenty room to grow before it catches up to the advanced economies, but it will most likely remain less developed in the years to come. (Data come from the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Economic Outlook Database.)\n\nA country\u2019s total economic output is the product of its labor force times its productivity (output per worker). The average standard of living is simply output per person, and thus driven by worker productivity, with a relatively small adjustment for how many of its population are working.\n\nIn an advanced economy such as the United States, economic growth is driven by technological change. Technology should be taken broadly, meaning not only scientific and engineering innovations but also business method improvements (such as Walmart\u2019s inventory management).\n\nA less developed economy, such as China, can grow more rapidly than an advanced economy, in what economists call \u201ccatch-up growth.\u201d The country does not need to develop new technology; it can take large strides by copying well-proven technology from the developed countries.\n\nHowever, an economy is constrained by its policies and institutions. Economic activity will be greatest when decisions are made by people without constraints aside from property rights. But the people in most democracies and the rulers in most non-democracies have other goals. The distribution of income and social safety nets, for example, can be goals that lead to policies which limit economic activity. Whether they are good or bad policies goes beyond economics into philosophy, ethics and the values of the people making judgments.\n\nGovernment policies that interfere with private decisions affect potential economic activity. This leads to a view that for most countries, potential economic activity is some fraction of the top country\u2019s actual activity. How much of that potential is achieved depends on the country\u2019s policies and institutions. German\u2019s GDP per capita is 83% of the U.S. level, while Italy\u2019s is 71%. Governance is not the only reason for the difference, but it\u2019s a large one.\n\nThe United States leads the larger economies in GDP per capita. (Some small countries such as Lichtenstein and Monaco do very well in the rankings.) Though U.S. policies and institutions do not completely maximize economic output, we do better than the other large countries.\n\nEuropean countries generally enjoy high-income, but mostly behind the U.S. both in current level and recent growth rates. The reason for European under-performance is that high priority has gone to protecting old ways instead of accepting new ways.\n\nMario Draghi\u2019s report cited this fact: \u201cEurope is stuck in a static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines. In fact, there is no EU company with a market capitalisation over EUR 100 billion that has been set up from scratch in the last fifty years, while all six US companies with a valuation above EUR 1 trillion have been created in this period.\u201d He cited this key issue: \u201c\u2026 innovative companies that want to scale up in Europe are hindered at every stage by inconsistent and restrictive regulations.\u201d\n\nA recent study found that \u201crestructuring costs (that include much more than severance packages) are approximately 10 times higher in countries with high labor protection, such as in Western Europe, than in countries with low labor protection such as in the United States.\u201d When a company must pay a great deal to fire an employee, it will hesitate to hire in the first place.\n\nThe list of largest corporations tells an interesting story. The European Union\u2019s ten largest companies (ranked by market capitalization) include three luxury consumer goods companies: LVMH, Hermes and L\u2019Oreal. In the U.S. market, eight of the top ten are technology innovators, one (Walmart) is a business method innovator, and the other is Berkshire Hathaway. No fancy handbags in the group.\n\nChina\u2019s growth illustrates catch-up growth. The country was once richer than Europe, but that was from roughly 1000 to 1700 CE. In the 20th century, China was devastated by civil wars, Japanese occupation, and then very bad policies which led to low productivity and widespread famine. In the late 1970s, under Deng Xioping, policies improved as the government allowed communal farms to divide up land into individual plots and then tolerated small business, later courting foreign investment.\n\nThe question for China looking forward is how much further can productivity grow under current government policies. China certainly is not trying to maximize economic output. The chief priority seems to be maintaining power in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. And President Xi Jinping believes that top-down directives from political rulers can allocate resources better than the bottom-up competitive process, a belief contradicted by every instance of central planning.\n\nLooking forward, China\u2019s GDP per capita is under one-third the U.S. level. Even with poor governance, it may very well be able to grow faster than the United States and G7 countries. People in poor-productivity sectors, such as rural farming, can continue moving into cities where higher-productivity work is available. Manual processes in manufacturing, agriculture and construction can be improved with still fairly simple tools. However, building more useless stuff\u2014such as \u201cghost cities\u201d with empty apartments\u2014helps their economic statistics without improving the quality of life. Valuing a project at cost of production rather than value in an arm\u2019s length sale\u2014common in all economic statistics\u2014especially mars Chinese data.\n\nMany critiques of China\u2019s economy note the bad policies but fail to ask, \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d China is so far behind the developed world now that more catch-up growth is possible.\n\nA large bet on Chinese economic growth would be speculative at this point. But business decisions that require only modest economic growth should bear fruit. In other words, company leaders should look at particular opportunities rather than painting the country with a broad brush. When sales or purchases can be made with the likelihood of a solid profit margin, then don\u2019t be afraid of China. But an investment that only pays off with rapid economic growth is for people comfortable with wagering large amounts on a roulette wheel\u2014betting on the red, of course.",

      "text": "I know nothing of any of the details mentioned by any of those people. But I do know some things.\n* As messy as the US and EU are, they are at least democracies whose governments do follow the people's will sooner or later. China is a dictatorship and Xi thinks he can bend the people to his will. He is wrong.\n* Governments discourage innovation and encourage group think, dictators more so.\n* Flexibility in society is what keeps a government from going stale and brittle. Biden and Trump have been knocking the pendulum back and forth, but it does have a center. Xi has been holding the pendulum still and that does not bode well for when he dies.\n* China has 3-4 times the population of the US, 2x the US+EU. India has a little more. I don't know what India's problem is. I know what China's problem is: the CCP. Once those two countries sort out their problems, of course they will outproduce the rest of the world. But until they do, they will be followers, not innovators.\nThe claims from the last couple of years of Chinese advances in EVs, especially batteries, rest almost entirely on cheap prices, as if no one has ever heard of subsidies. There's been a recent small scandal in Android phones, with a couple of Chinese makers caught cheating on claims of how thin their phones are. That matches my experience with all dictatorships, such as the Soviets fooling Americans about how many planes they had by flying the same three around in circles at a May Day parade. This is the national behavior of followers and sycophants, not innovators. I expect it in politics, and it's been there in spades with Trump and Biden and Obama. But industry? In a free society, it seldom gets very far.\n\u201cThere's been a recent small scandal in Android phones, with a couple of Chinese makers caught cheating on claims of how thin their phones are. That matches my experience with all dictatorships\u2026\u201d\nI doubt that the West is immune from such things. For example, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that Volkswagen was juicing their diesel emissions numbers. That didn\u2019t end too well for them or for clean diesel generally. We could also look to various other accounting scandals over the past 25 years or the Purdue Pharma marketing of opioids or Wells Fargo fake accounts or the Boeing 737 MAX.\nIs China dumb enough to adopt suicide policies like open borders, net zero, free trade, drug legalization, defund the police, racial grievances or DEI?\nIf not, I\u2019m guessing that they will be around to be reckoned with for some time to come.\nWe agree that free trade is a conceptually good thing. But, what is marketed as \u201cfree trade\u201d and what exists in actuality are two different things. Bend over America while everyone else erects silly barriers based the silliest of reasons. China gets this, which is why they have barriers to imports, while the U.S. mostly just bends over because some Ivy League educated economist said we should without providing much evidence.\nI support most of the things Trump has done to help American exporters get a better deal selling to other countries. I agree we let things get too one-sided.\nI do not support ongoing high tariffs, however, because those hurt American consumers and in many cases American producers as well.\nI would prefer Trump to use tariffs as leverage to get other countries to reduce their tariffs and NTBs (Non-tariff Trade Barriers).\nWe could argue about your list but it should be obvious there are many other things China can do that are as bad or worse. I would argue it already does.\nIt is basically a closed society, at least to us outside of it, so we cannot know until it happens. I havent read anything about it, but did anyone accurately predict what would happen to in the USSR after Stalins death.\nAnd Xi doesnt have to die for a change to occur, but that is the way to bet\nThe rift between China and the USSR dates back to Krushchev's speech to the 20th Party Congress denouncing the excesses of Stalinism and the cult of personality surrounding him. Mao didn't approve. While it is true the Chinese economic system was liberalized following Mao's death (it doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice), there wasn't a comparable official denunciation of Maoism, which went far beyond the excesses of Stalinism in terms of mass murder and brutality. As I said elsewhere on this thread, the CCP has studied and learned from the rise and fall of its Soviet counterpart, and it is determined not to repeat what they view as the latter's mistakes.\nChina does not have social cohesion at all; it is an incredibly bitter and antagonistic society in many ways. I think many commentators don't realize that declining social cohesion can take forms beyond political polarization. If anyone is interested, look up The China Show on YouTube, which is a podcast made by two Western guys who lived in China for over a decade and are fluent in Chinese. They translate leaks from the Chinese internet about frequent industrial and construction disasters, \"revenge against society\" attacks, and social protests against withheld wages, among many other things. China is a very crazy and chaotic place, but that is not reported in the Western media because the CCP is very good at censorship. However, they cannot stop 1.4 billion people with phone cameras from shedding light on unpleasant things 100% of the time. It doesn't help that Western journalists have not known how to do actual investigative journalism for decades. There is also a strong narrative that China is an orderly, unstoppable rising threat to the world, akin to Nazi Germany (which is not entirely untrue).\nI like Peter Turchin, but he and most other Western intellectuals form their views based on second-hand accounts of what other Western intellectuals write. If you look at actual primary source evidence, there are daily major disasters from factories burning to \"tofu dreg\" buildings collapsing. The government has installed bollards in almost all heavy pedestrian areas because disgruntled mentally ill people (with no possible support system) frequently plow through crowds with their cars. You could go on and on about other problems, like demographics or the topics Zeihan often discusses. The point is that the idea that China is nothing but a nation of cutting-edge scientists building high-speed maglev rail, super tall skyscrapers, and world-class AI systems is such a misleading facade.\nSome good comments, but they do not take into consideration that China is broke. Adding the debt of all SOEs and local municipalities to the debt-to-GDP ratio is quite remarkable. The share of local government debt rose to more than 60% of GDP from close to 50%. The overall non-financial debt increased to 312% of GDP in 2024, up from 245% in 2023, putting China among the most indebted countries. Think of that - Debt to GDP of 312%\nCracks are appearing in the dams, and if a dam/bank fails, China's domestic situation will become awful.\nChina is doing so well their citizens are doing everything they can to convert RMB to anything by RMB. It is so bad that all crypto was banned by law. The Chinese are the number one nationality of people seeking second citizenship. Nothing in China is rosy; it's mostly dreary or ominous.\nI've never understood why anyone would think the US is disintegrating from within. We've almost always fought like cats and dogs within the political arena. That is nothing new, but we have these newfangled things called elections that bring balance and buy-in to the system. The economy is strong and remains innovative even if we do consume too much.\nMaybe it was better in the '80s than now. China presents some problems for other countries, and the US influence there is notable, but in the US? I sure don't see it.\nThen again, I think Trump is effectively addressing some of the problems that arose in recent years as the US became more like China, and correcting those mistakes.\n\u201cWe've almost always fought like cats and dogs within the political arena. That is nothing new\u201d\nYou might be correct if you\u2019re talking throughout U.S. history.\nBut in the memory of almost everyone living today, the political divisions now are much greater than they were from at least WWII though about 2003-2004 (or even through 2014, if you prefer).\nThis is true on economic policy.\nIt is true on Middle Eastern foreign policy.\nIt is true re: the amount of overlap across the parties on policy (Southern Democrats pre 1980 resulted in much greater overlap than we have now).\nIt is true on cultural issues (even if, admittedly, those differences have been growing since the late 60s).\nAnd it is true of political rhetoric. Both sides used to talk of being for the little guy and the middle class. And until about 10 years ago, Dems arguably had the better argument there (whatever the reality). Now they have abandoned the lower-middle class so entirely that they call the racists, bigots, deplorables, etc.\nYes, politicians went after each other before, surely. But with the notable exception of vilifying \u201cthe rich\u201d, vilification of a large class of *voters* by a major party has just not happened previously.\nNow, I do agree with your claim that folks saying the US is disintegrating from within are wrong.\nBut there is indeed something relatively new about our politics compared to the prior 80 years\nYes, I think you are making a good point about vilification, although it may have existed during the segregation era.\nI do worry about the attitudes of younger folks toward Israel\u2014lack of critical thinking, in my opinion, but then I look back and remember how stupid I was and probably still am.\nBut IMO the problem here is far worse than stupidity. Though obviously it is partially due to ignorance of the facts.\nThe dangerous part IMO, however, is that it is rooted in the (quasi-religious) belief in oppressor-oppressed ideology, which basically states that the evil rich white Christian (or Jewish in the case of Israel) straight male capitalist patriarchy is responsible for all evil - and little good - in our zero-sum world.\nAnd that the oppressed have the right BY. ANY. MEANS. NECESSARY. to overcome their oppressors.\nAnd so since the evil rich white capitalist Israelis are oppressing the poor without agency PoC Palestinians, Hamas has the right and obligation to butcher, rape and take hostages of civilians, including babies. And should be supported because their goals are just.\nAnd about half of all young people indeed DO support Hamas. Which means *large* majorities of left-voting young people support Hamas.\nSad. And sick.\nAnd WAY worse, and far more dangerous, than the ignorance/stupidity we had in our youth.\nNo. In simplest terms, the Great Society and related repeated indulgences indulgences of the much farther left, has had nightmarish results that we have to pretend are great in a fashion no different from communism.\nThe body politic and bureaucratic is addicted to the production of the underclass, to the point of course of shopping abroad for its increase; and politics going forward will be entirely a competition for the purchase of these votes, if it doesn\u2019t become a competition for the purchase of office.\nThe modern history of the sidelining of the environmental movement by both parties, one falling into Fpuvaultian radicalism and the other gleefully co-opting this madness, neatly encapsulates this. Once, a sane and functioning electorate could be swayed by an appeal to something other than gross material consumption. Now, someone like Mike Lee can moot selling off public lands, and never creating another national park for a growing population, and celebrating the extirpation of species, when wildlife even enters the chat - and yes, a few older legacy Americans will be mad about that. But their numbers are too few to matter and in the main newer \u201cAmericans\u201c will never care about that in the slightest.\nToday is an easy one. I live in Wuhan. I've long been in Turchin's camp and am on board with his thesis, I've said many times Noah is unbelievably clueless on China (his piece yesterday was just plain idiotic), and Zeihan is a moron.\n\"China is currently the most consequential country in the world. As the American Empire continues to disintegrate from within, the most likely next hegemonic power is going to be China.\"\nWe disagree China is currently most consequential. Regardless, can you interpret this statement? Surely a hegemonic power is most consequential. How is China most consequential but not hegemonic? Is he saying there is no hegemonic power currently? Is there any other way to interpret this?\nWhere did I say anything about this? If I did, it was a mistake. If you show me where it is, I'll delete it. I also don't write things like \"American continues to disintegrate from within...\" I have no idea why someone would write something that silly.\nWait...actually I do. They ran out of intelligent things to talk about.\nI don't know who is most consequential, or what that even means. It's internet noise.\nLol. Turchin wrote it. It is the start of the quote by AK. Doesn't matter if \"being in his camp\" means you agree with him on this. My questions are still questions.\nI'm in his camp on the overproduction of elites thesis. All the other stuff...I don't know. Turchin doesn't know anything about China that can't be gleaned from some other source. He's never been there near as I can tell. He's just one of the many bloggers/Substackers that just discovered China and thinks he's got something say about it.\nI usually ignore all that that stuff the China Writers And Thinkers\u2122 blather about. Hegemonic and/or most consequential? I don't care.\nLike...all of them. Lots and lots of recent graduates, somewhere around 12 million this year, an increase of approximately a half million over last year. On average, >10 million every year for the last several years. Depending on whose numbers you want to believe, youth unemployment hovers between 14.5% and >20%. Look into the job market in China, you'll get a decent picture of the issues.\nI see a hole in my understanding of economics. Maybe I can correctly list reasons the US is a net importer yet has low unemployment but I'm less sure how China has an excess of workers generally, not just knowledge workers. Do you have an explanation?\nThanks for the recommendation on Turchin. I just realized that you\u2019re reading Arnold\u2019s blog from within China. Does this mean that you can read everything posted at In My Tribe? In other words, are you aware of any censorship preventing you from reading his Substack? Sorry if my questions seem naive. I really don\u2019t know what the government of China tends to censor except what I hear in the media, typically about censorship on certain Apple products.\nSubstack is not (normally) available in China. Internet access is tightly controlled on everything. Let's just say that surprising numbers of Chinese are able to read and post whatever they want all over the internet. Censorship in China is vast topic, too much for me to get into here.\nThat\u2019s great news. Perhaps this is the most important fact about China in this entire post. It means that things in China will probably turn out better than we expect.\nI don't do hard predictions, especially on China and absolutely not in any internet comments section. But, Chinese are resilient. Get yourself ready for the 2nd China Shock, where China blows by everyone in automobile tech, EV tech in general, biotech, pharmaceuticals, robotics of every possible iteration, medical analytical equipment, and basically, every technological frontier of the future. They're so far out in front right now, it's shocking. Where it lands...everyone else can argue about it. They're in Warp Drive right now on the technologies of the future.\nI follow the Bryan Caplan school of investing in that I hold a globally diverse portfolio of index funds, including Vanguard\u2019s VEMAX, which is composed of 31% Chinese companies. So I hope you\u2019re correct, and not just for me and mine, but for everyone. Thanks for your perspective. Where can we find out more about the technological advances going on in China? What should we be reading?\nOn Substack... Read Kevin Walmsley, Robert Wu, Pekingnology, SCMP (South China Morning Post), China Talk, Baiguan, Kevin Xu, Got China Daily Briefing, China Thought Express, Sinification by Thomas des Garets Geddes, The US-China Perception Monitor, Xinhua (yeah, it's the mouthpiece for the Party, but it does contains real news)....jeez, it's hard to list all of it. .\nFor background, read \"China Emerging\" by Wu Xiaobo. There's some real nuggets in there. I heard he's gotten into a bit of trouble for some of the stuff in there.\nIf you want to understand governance in China, read \"From The Soil\" by Fei Xiaotong. You will struggle with it, but READ IT. If you get through it, you will start to understand why Western \"analysis\" of China is essentially nonsense. Not in the sense that it's lies and untruths, but that it is a pile of ahistorical decontextualized nonsense.\nAvoid falling into the idea that the WSJ and NYT are providing anything worth reading, and most of the thought leaders in the West, (Noah types) are worthless. Beyond worthless. Delusional on occasion. Generally, Western media is clueless on China. Painfully clueless.\nPer investing... I'm a moron. I own a small pile of Amazon that I bought for pennies because it seemed like a good idea and I own an apartment building in a good area. I have no idea if your China investments are solid or not. I know if you bought BYD before anyone knew about it, you'd be smiling. I know a few others, but like I said, I'm the last person you want to take investment advice from.\nIf demographics is destiny, China will age out before it is able to replace the US empire. So my next candidate is India, which has no resource curse, a highly successful diaspora, and a strong English tradition (in many senses). It may boil down to whether the US can continue to attract the best-and-brightest from around the world or reform its K-12 system...\nAs I ponder Dr. Kling\u2019s substack today, I have the Volleyball Nations League finals on and #8 China just took the first set from #1 Brazil before a happy and supportive Chinese crowd. However awful the repression within China, one gets the impression that a majority rof Chinese citizens are more or less content with Xi, the government, and the CCP, and confident in their nation\u2019s future. This seems born out even in anonymous polling where 60% of citizens apparently support the government. (https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/chinese-communist-party-support-lower-when-surveys-anonymous/ ) Indeed, the Chinese Communist Party has about 100 million members which alone would be a significant power base. And the repression perhaps seems targeted against Muslims and Hong Kong dissidents, whom are not significant components of the total population. (https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/repression-in-xis-china/ ).\nSo why does it appear that a stable mass of Chinese are willing to tolerate a political system that most of us on the outside would find intolerable? And does the answer to this question perhaps explain why China has yet to fail significantly and indeed to continue to grow in prestige and power?\nWell, my favorite hammer in the toolbox of political concepts is the principle of solidarity and so today I will wail on that nail in the Chinese context.\nYes, China has a strongly hierarchy with centralized control. But so does the Catholic Church and the United States. But like those other entities, the lower levels in the hierarchy exercise authority and offer citizens voice and participation.\nLet\u2019s start with how Section 5 of the constitution of China, \u201cLocal People\u2019s Congresses at All Levels and Local People\u2019s Governments at All Levels.\u201d (https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/lawsregulations/201911/20/content_WS5ed8856ec6d0b3f0e9499913.html ) establishes a countervailing bottom-up flow of power. Article 95 provides for local government, \u201cProvinces, cities directly under central government jurisdiction, counties, cities, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships and towns shall establish people\u2019s congresses and people\u2019s governments.\u201d Article 97 provides for direct election of officials at the base levels with people\u2019s congresses at higher levels choosing members of the next higher level, \u201cDeputies to the people\u2019s congresses of provinces, cities directly under central government jurisdiction and cities divided into districts shall be elected by the people\u2019s congresses at the next level down; deputies to the people\u2019s congresses of counties, cities not divided into districts, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships and towns shall be directly elected by their constituencies.\u201d There may indeed be top-down political control, but the local officials who do the day to day local work are not assigned by the central government.\nPerhaps much to the dismay of YIMBYs and the delight of NIMBYs local government\u2019s apparently extensive economic power and remit is set out in Article 99:\n\u201cArticle 99 Local people\u2019s congresses at all levels shall, within their administrative areas, ensure the observance and enforcement of the Constitution, laws and administrative regulations; they shall, according to the authority invested in them as prescribed by law, adopt and issue resolutions, and review and decide on local economic, cultural and public service development plans.\nLocal people\u2019s congresses at and above the county level shall review and approve the economic and social development plans and budgets of their administrative areas as well as reports on their implementation; they shall have the power to change or revoke inappropriate decisions made by their own standing committees.\nThe people\u2019s congresses of ethnic townships may, according to the authority invested in them as prescribed by law, take specific measures suited to ethnic characteristics.\u201d\nSo it would appear that with respect to local economic development, citizens of China have sovereignty somewhat similar to that of US citizens.\nThus, I would argue critiques of China based on a one-sided assessment of top-down centralized power may be failing to take into account the whole picture.\nMore importantly, highly decentralized Brazil who strongly realizes the principle of subsidiarity has taken the match from China 3-1 thus proving the validity or perhaps maybe offering symbolic support to this argument.\n\"Thus, I would argue critiques of China based on a one-sided assessment of top-down centralized power may be failing to take into account the whole picture.\"\nYes. You could expand that idea into several arenas concerning China.\nI'm feet on the ground in Wuhan, and generally speaking, there's much less \"in your face\" stuff from China's government than I experience in the US. Seriously. In fact, the Heritage Foundation, about 10 years ago, stopped with their analysis of the issue in their annual report because China scored better than America.\nWell, the 90% own their own homes appears to be true - which I confess surprised me, so thanks for that - but the 80% owning them free and clear is not.\nAnd even the first claim is misleading, since in urban areas - where 60%+ of the population now live - the GOVERNMENT owns the land underneath the home, not the homeowner.\nAnd in fact, mortgage debt is common.\nUnless you can show hard evidence for this 2nd claim. But pretty sure it don\u2019t exist.\nIt's impossible for me to say. Maybe someone else knows.\nI know Chinese do not like debt. Debt on consumer silliness is a young people phenomenon. I do know a lot of folks in China own their homes. I and my wife own a few. Income tax is incredibly low (low single digit %) and there is NO PROPERTY TAX. Everyone knows property tax is coming, but right now there isn't any property tax.\nThe Catholic church? Talk about an apples to oranges comparison. The Catholic church isn't in charge of the entire US government. Reading constitutions doesn't tell you much about how things work in practice even in so-called liberal Western countries, let alone in authoritarian regimes like China's. I bet the constitution for the Democratic Republic of North Korea sounds good on paper as well. And the principle of 'top-down bottom-up' is just an old idea borrowed from Soviet Communism, not some Chinese innovation evidencing democratization at the local level.\nWell there is no denying China's authoritarianism working hand in hand with strong centralized power as is only natural. But many observers describe elements of decentralization as well with local administration in areas in which locals can perform better than remote bureaucracies. An article in Nature states:\n\"Although hybrid forms of democracy that combine elements of Western democracy and authoritarianism are acknowledged as being possible, the debate over whether the Chinese political system fits the definition of democracy is still ongoing (Tang 2021). In the meantime, it appears that the benefits of traditional democracy are penetrating Chinese legal scholarship, policymaking, and lawmaking to a greater degree. Although the visible role of state structures in the PRC is well known (i.e., that they have historically tended toward centralisation and vertical power), the Chinese state has had to deal with increasingly multi-layered social changes, the decentralisation of the economy, and local governance in the post-reform era (Wu and Zhang, 2022).\nFrom a formal point of view, the Chinese legislator does not define the relationship between the concepts of GG [\"grassroots governance\"] and the concept of local self-government, which in a sense complicates the understanding of the subtleties of meaning that the Chinese legislator and the subjects of political initiative put into the definition of GG. However, based on the political documents of the CCP, it can be argued that this is about both issues of self-organisation and grassroots initiative, as well as the process of governance at the local level. Of interest in this regard is the relatively recent CCP political act \u201cOpinion of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Strengthening Grassroots Management Modernisation and Management Capacity (April 28, 2021) (Communist Party of China, 2021). The paper notes that GG is the cornerstone of national governance, and the overall promotion of township (street) and urban and rural community governance is a major project to realise the modernisation of the national governance system and governance capacity (Communist Party of China, 2021).\"\nFrom this and other articles, I get the impression that there might be some nuance to it all. But the bottom line is that every 5 years a couple thousand delegates to a new National People's Congress, China's supreme authority, are officially elected by local people's congresses at the provincial level. So China is not entirely a military type organization with authority flowing in one direction only.\nThe titles of the political documents of the CCP you cite remind me of George Orwell's 1984. Doublespeak. If you think the Chinese political system is actually some hybrid form of democracy, why don't you joint Kurt and go live there?\nYou couldn\u2019t pay me to visit there. I just want to understand why it seems like a majority of Chinese seem to appear content in a system that I would find intolerable.\n1) No history of democracy and political liberalization -- you don't miss what you and your ancestors never had?\n2) improving living standards and lots of employment opportunities?\n3) Freedom to move abroad (if you can find a country that will take you) acts as a safety valve?\n4) the majority of Chinese people prefer living in a country where ethnic Chinese people are the dominant majority and Chinese culture is dominant (they don't believe diversity is our strength)?\nI visited Hong Kong before the handover and eventually the takeover by the CCP. Interesting place, but I wouldn't want to live there either.\nThis is an interesting post. I consider it weaker than your average post, but the linked article is a good one and worth reading. Without firsthand experience of being in China, it\u2019s difficult to know what people are thinking and discussing there, but based on the Chinese people I\u2019ve met here, they are busy with two important activities: working hard and improving the welfare of their families\u2014similar to us.\nDo they have sufficient intellectual independence (and wealth) to create more political independence for themselves? My guess is yes. Things will continue to get better in China on average over the longterm.\nWhat can we do to help them? Certainly we should be pushing for free trade. Arnold, I know it might be mundane to discuss the merits of free trade, but maybe you can come up with a helpful post on this topic? Or something related to China\u2019s economy and culture? More links?\nEven the pro-globalist members of 'the blob' who have been the leading proponents of the idea that free trade with China will result in political liberalization in that country now acknowledge that this idea has been thoroughly discredited by actual experience. That should have been obvious from the start of the experiment with globalization. The Chinese Communist Party copied its governance model from the Soviet Communist Party, but as usual, the Chinese 'tweaked' the model, and they did so with the objective of fortifying the model against renegades who might undermine the CCP's monopoly on political power like Gorbachev. Free trade with China not only does not and cannot result in more political independence for Chinese citizens, but in fact it does the opposite by bolstering the existing Chinese political system and helping to maintain the political power of the CCP. This is one of the things that irks me about libertarians who whine about free trade and any interference in their ability to buy anything they want from an authoritarian country like China. At least have the honesty to admit that your principled libertarianism is somewhat hypocritical.\nI agree that trade has not resulted in the political liberalization that was expected. That doesn't mean it won't. And it doesn't mean it hasn't increased desire and readiness of the people.\nIf US traded with China less could we have realistically expected or forced that on the rest of the world? What if we were the only ones not trading with China?\nWere Gorbachev's actions expected when he took office? What will Xi's successor do?\nBelieving that US trade with China under its existing political system has the potential to result in political liberalization when it has failed to do so after decades of such trade meets the definition of insanity. As for Gorbachev, the CCP's system for selecting a successor to the Chairman is designed to weed out troublemaking political reformers like him. How they do that I can't say. In the Soviet case, I think Marxist-Leninist ideology was pretty much dead by the time Brezhnev croaked. I can't say the same about China. Today Trump issued an executive order closing the duty-free 'de minimus' loophole, which has allowed Chinese companies like Temu and Shein to flood the US market with low-cost junk. For all I know, reducing US trade with China has a better chance of resulting in political liberalization by putting millions of Chinese out of work and destabilizing the political system, although I'm not saying that is Trump's goal, just a potential side-effect.\nThe critical thing to understand about the CCP is that they have closely studied the rise and fall of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union and they are bound and determined to avoid the latter's fate at all costs.\n\"Xi Jinping is reorienting China\u2019s economy around producing a bunch of stuff that Chinese people don\u2019t want or need, because this fits with his idea of what makes a country strong.\nThat is what industrial policy is all about, though, isn\u2019t it?\"\nNo, it making thing the world wants: Boeing Aircraft.\nHard to believe the comparison between Peter Turchin and Peter Zeihan.\nI\u2019ve listened to several of Peter Zeihan podcasts, and his arguments are riddled with factual errors and inaccuracies.\nEg here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UltVl2Qlf6A&t=314s he states that China \"imports 75-80% of its energy\" while the actual share of imported energy vs total consumed is ~20-25%. More appalling as he fashion himself as an expert of demography, on the same interview he states that China \"has more people > 53 than under\" (China's median age is 39).\nBeyond his clear ideological biases, he lacks any credentials that would qualify him as a legitimate expert.\nPeter Turchin on the other side is an rigorous and original scholar\n\"That is what industrial policy is all about, though, isn\u2019t it?\"\nI get that even if you think this is 100% true, there still is probably a bit of sarcasm in this comment but it's not true. It's also about funneling money to political friends.\nOk, that's some sarcasm too. But industrial policy can have some positives too, even if it doesn't always and they are harder to see than the flaws in execution.\nWhy is it surprising that the left-of-center, industrial policy fan, technocrat Noah Smith believes as Thomas Friedman does in the superiority of the benevolent dictator model?\nIf only Deng Xiaoping ran China forever, it would be the greatest country on earth.\nUnited States has excelled the last hundred years because of all the discoveries made through our research institutes and research universities. China has realized this and has made a tremendous investment in research that will pay off. Already they may be ahead of us in some areas of research including AI and biomedical sciences are among the best in the world. At the same time we are beginning to disinvest in basic research and it will come back to haunt us. While China made lose its preeminence as the world manufacturer as its population ages is moving into highly lucrative areas where a relatively small portion of the population will make a big difference for it\n\u201cAlready they may be ahead of us in some areas of research including AI\u201d\nIdk about biomedical sciences.\nAnd idk what the further out future holds.\nBut suggesting that the Chinese may *already* be ahead of U.S. in AI is just stupid talk.\nThe success of DeepSeek may show that they are not as far behind as the consensus believed a year ago, but it is a MASSIVE step from there to the idea that they are ahead in AI.\nI realize you inserted the qualifier \u201cmay\u201d. Of course, I *may* be better than LeBron James at basketball\u2026\nDo you have ANY evidence at all for your claim that they may be ahead?!?\nI know nothing of any of the details mentioned by any of those people. But I do know some things.\n* As messy as the US and EU are, they are at least democracies whose governments do follow the people's will sooner or later. China is a dictatorship and Xi thinks he can bend the people to his will. He is wrong.\n* Governments discourage innovation and encourage group think, dictators more so.\n* Flexibility in society is what keeps a government from going stale and brittle. Biden and Trump have been knocking the pendulum back and forth, but it does have a center. Xi has been holding the pendulum still and that does not bode well for when he dies.\n* China has 3-4 times the population of the US, 2x the US+EU. India has a little more. I don't know what India's problem is. I know what China's problem is: the CCP. Once those two countries sort out their problems, of course they will outproduce the rest of the world. But until they do, they will be followers, not innovators.\nThe claims from the last couple of years of Chinese advances in EVs, especially batteries, rest almost entirely on cheap prices, as if no one has ever heard of subsidies. There's been a recent small scandal in Android phones, with a couple of Chinese makers caught cheating on claims of how thin their phones are. That matches my experience with all dictatorships, such as the Soviets fooling Americans about how many planes they had by flying the same three around in circles at a May Day parade. This is the national behavior of followers and sycophants, not innovators. I expect it in politics, and it's been there in spades with Trump and Biden and Obama. But industry? In a free society, it seldom gets very far.\n/rant\n\u201cThere's been a recent small scandal in Android phones, with a couple of Chinese makers caught cheating on claims of how thin their phones are. That matches my experience with all dictatorships\u2026\u201d\nI doubt that the West is immune from such things. For example, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that Volkswagen was juicing their diesel emissions numbers. That didn\u2019t end too well for them or for clean diesel generally. We could also look to various other accounting scandals over the past 25 years or the Purdue Pharma marketing of opioids or Wells Fargo fake accounts or the Boeing 737 MAX.\nThat's true. I was mostly struck by how crude the phone thickness fraud was and how they apparently didn't expect anyone would check it.\nIs China dumb enough to adopt suicide policies like open borders, net zero, free trade, drug legalization, defund the police, racial grievances or DEI?\nIf not, I\u2019m guessing that they will be around to be reckoned with for some time to come.\nAs Mr. Rodgers used to say, one of these things is not like the others.\nFree trade is not only *not* a suicide policy, it is an \u201calmost everyone gets richer\u201d policy.\nWe agree that free trade is a conceptually good thing. But, what is marketed as \u201cfree trade\u201d and what exists in actuality are two different things. Bend over America while everyone else erects silly barriers based the silliest of reasons. China gets this, which is why they have barriers to imports, while the U.S. mostly just bends over because some Ivy League educated economist said we should without providing much evidence.\nOk, closer.\nWords mean things.\nFree trade is goodness.\nFreer trade is also goodness.\nI support most of the things Trump has done to help American exporters get a better deal selling to other countries. I agree we let things get too one-sided.\nI do not support ongoing high tariffs, however, because those hurt American consumers and in many cases American producers as well.\nI would prefer Trump to use tariffs as leverage to get other countries to reduce their tariffs and NTBs (Non-tariff Trade Barriers).\nIn other words, free/freer trade.\nWe could argue about your list but it should be obvious there are many other things China can do that are as bad or worse. I would argue it already does.\nXi is an old man. His reign won't last forever. Unless Emperor Xi does something really big soon, China's future depends on who takes his place.\nBut how likely is that to result in more than a small change better or worse?\nIt is basically a closed society, at least to us outside of it, so we cannot know until it happens. I havent read anything about it, but did anyone accurately predict what would happen to in the USSR after Stalins death.\nAnd Xi doesnt have to die for a change to occur, but that is the way to bet\nThe rift between China and the USSR dates back to Krushchev's speech to the 20th Party Congress denouncing the excesses of Stalinism and the cult of personality surrounding him. Mao didn't approve. While it is true the Chinese economic system was liberalized following Mao's death (it doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice), there wasn't a comparable official denunciation of Maoism, which went far beyond the excesses of Stalinism in terms of mass murder and brutality. As I said elsewhere on this thread, the CCP has studied and learned from the rise and fall of its Soviet counterpart, and it is determined not to repeat what they view as the latter's mistakes.\nThe people highest up in China might have better guesses but still guesses.\nThe US is pretty open and we don't have a clue what Trump's successor will be like.\nChina does not have social cohesion at all; it is an incredibly bitter and antagonistic society in many ways. I think many commentators don't realize that declining social cohesion can take forms beyond political polarization. If anyone is interested, look up The China Show on YouTube, which is a podcast made by two Western guys who lived in China for over a decade and are fluent in Chinese. They translate leaks from the Chinese internet about frequent industrial and construction disasters, \"revenge against society\" attacks, and social protests against withheld wages, among many other things. China is a very crazy and chaotic place, but that is not reported in the Western media because the CCP is very good at censorship. However, they cannot stop 1.4 billion people with phone cameras from shedding light on unpleasant things 100% of the time. It doesn't help that Western journalists have not known how to do actual investigative journalism for decades. There is also a strong narrative that China is an orderly, unstoppable rising threat to the world, akin to Nazi Germany (which is not entirely untrue).\nI like Peter Turchin, but he and most other Western intellectuals form their views based on second-hand accounts of what other Western intellectuals write. If you look at actual primary source evidence, there are daily major disasters from factories burning to \"tofu dreg\" buildings collapsing. The government has installed bollards in almost all heavy pedestrian areas because disgruntled mentally ill people (with no possible support system) frequently plow through crowds with their cars. You could go on and on about other problems, like demographics or the topics Zeihan often discusses. The point is that the idea that China is nothing but a nation of cutting-edge scientists building high-speed maglev rail, super tall skyscrapers, and world-class AI systems is such a misleading facade.\nSome good comments, but they do not take into consideration that China is broke. Adding the debt of all SOEs and local municipalities to the debt-to-GDP ratio is quite remarkable. The share of local government debt rose to more than 60% of GDP from close to 50%. The overall non-financial debt increased to 312% of GDP in 2024, up from 245% in 2023, putting China among the most indebted countries. Think of that - Debt to GDP of 312%\nCracks are appearing in the dams, and if a dam/bank fails, China's domestic situation will become awful.\nChina is doing so well their citizens are doing everything they can to convert RMB to anything by RMB. It is so bad that all crypto was banned by law. The Chinese are the number one nationality of people seeking second citizenship. Nothing in China is rosy; it's mostly dreary or ominous.\nI've never understood why anyone would think the US is disintegrating from within. We've almost always fought like cats and dogs within the political arena. That is nothing new, but we have these newfangled things called elections that bring balance and buy-in to the system. The economy is strong and remains innovative even if we do consume too much.\nMaybe it was better in the '80s than now. China presents some problems for other countries, and the US influence there is notable, but in the US? I sure don't see it.\nThen again, I think Trump is effectively addressing some of the problems that arose in recent years as the US became more like China, and correcting those mistakes.\n\u201cWe've almost always fought like cats and dogs within the political arena. That is nothing new\u201d\nYou might be correct if you\u2019re talking throughout U.S. history.\nBut in the memory of almost everyone living today, the political divisions now are much greater than they were from at least WWII though about 2003-2004 (or even through 2014, if you prefer).\nThis is true on economic policy.\nIt is true on Middle Eastern foreign policy.\nIt is true re: the amount of overlap across the parties on policy (Southern Democrats pre 1980 resulted in much greater overlap than we have now).\nIt is true on cultural issues (even if, admittedly, those differences have been growing since the late 60s).\nAnd it is true of political rhetoric. Both sides used to talk of being for the little guy and the middle class. And until about 10 years ago, Dems arguably had the better argument there (whatever the reality). Now they have abandoned the lower-middle class so entirely that they call the racists, bigots, deplorables, etc.\nYes, politicians went after each other before, surely. But with the notable exception of vilifying \u201cthe rich\u201d, vilification of a large class of *voters* by a major party has just not happened previously.\nNow, I do agree with your claim that folks saying the US is disintegrating from within are wrong.\nBut there is indeed something relatively new about our politics compared to the prior 80 years\nYes, I think you are making a good point about vilification, although it may have existed during the segregation era.\nI do worry about the attitudes of younger folks toward Israel\u2014lack of critical thinking, in my opinion, but then I look back and remember how stupid I was and probably still am.\nOn Israel, I agree with your worry 10,000%.\nBut IMO the problem here is far worse than stupidity. Though obviously it is partially due to ignorance of the facts.\nThe dangerous part IMO, however, is that it is rooted in the (quasi-religious) belief in oppressor-oppressed ideology, which basically states that the evil rich white Christian (or Jewish in the case of Israel) straight male capitalist patriarchy is responsible for all evil - and little good - in our zero-sum world.\nAnd that the oppressed have the right BY. ANY. MEANS. NECESSARY. to overcome their oppressors.\nAnd so since the evil rich white capitalist Israelis are oppressing the poor without agency PoC Palestinians, Hamas has the right and obligation to butcher, rape and take hostages of civilians, including babies. And should be supported because their goals are just.\nAnd about half of all young people indeed DO support Hamas. Which means *large* majorities of left-voting young people support Hamas.\nSad. And sick.\nAnd WAY worse, and far more dangerous, than the ignorance/stupidity we had in our youth.\nNo. In simplest terms, the Great Society and related repeated indulgences indulgences of the much farther left, has had nightmarish results that we have to pretend are great in a fashion no different from communism.\nThe body politic and bureaucratic is addicted to the production of the underclass, to the point of course of shopping abroad for its increase; and politics going forward will be entirely a competition for the purchase of these votes, if it doesn\u2019t become a competition for the purchase of office.\nThe modern history of the sidelining of the environmental movement by both parties, one falling into Fpuvaultian radicalism and the other gleefully co-opting this madness, neatly encapsulates this. Once, a sane and functioning electorate could be swayed by an appeal to something other than gross material consumption. Now, someone like Mike Lee can moot selling off public lands, and never creating another national park for a growing population, and celebrating the extirpation of species, when wildlife even enters the chat - and yes, a few older legacy Americans will be mad about that. But their numbers are too few to matter and in the main newer \u201cAmericans\u201c will never care about that in the slightest.\nAmerica will have ceased to be.\nToday is an easy one. I live in Wuhan. I've long been in Turchin's camp and am on board with his thesis, I've said many times Noah is unbelievably clueless on China (his piece yesterday was just plain idiotic), and Zeihan is a moron.\n\"China is currently the most consequential country in the world. As the American Empire continues to disintegrate from within, the most likely next hegemonic power is going to be China.\"\nWe disagree China is currently most consequential. Regardless, can you interpret this statement? Surely a hegemonic power is most consequential. How is China most consequential but not hegemonic? Is he saying there is no hegemonic power currently? Is there any other way to interpret this?\nWhere did I say anything about this? If I did, it was a mistake. If you show me where it is, I'll delete it. I also don't write things like \"American continues to disintegrate from within...\" I have no idea why someone would write something that silly.\nWait...actually I do. They ran out of intelligent things to talk about.\nI don't know who is most consequential, or what that even means. It's internet noise.\nLol. Turchin wrote it. It is the start of the quote by AK. Doesn't matter if \"being in his camp\" means you agree with him on this. My questions are still questions.\nI'm in his camp on the overproduction of elites thesis. All the other stuff...I don't know. Turchin doesn't know anything about China that can't be gleaned from some other source. He's never been there near as I can tell. He's just one of the many bloggers/Substackers that just discovered China and thinks he's got something say about it.\nI usually ignore all that that stuff the China Writers And Thinkers\u2122 blather about. Hegemonic and/or most consequential? I don't care.\nYou might want to be more clear when you say you are in his camp. Apparently you don't agree with him on much that was in the quote.\nTurchin's thesis certainly fits the USA and explains a lot of our politics. Who are the elites who are overproduced in China?\nLike...all of them. Lots and lots of recent graduates, somewhere around 12 million this year, an increase of approximately a half million over last year. On average, >10 million every year for the last several years. Depending on whose numbers you want to believe, youth unemployment hovers between 14.5% and >20%. Look into the job market in China, you'll get a decent picture of the issues.\nI see a hole in my understanding of economics. Maybe I can correctly list reasons the US is a net importer yet has low unemployment but I'm less sure how China has an excess of workers generally, not just knowledge workers. Do you have an explanation?\nThere's a lot of people in China...(?)\nI don't know. That's stuff the Substack Economists think about. I'll accept any reasonable explanation.\nThanks for the recommendation on Turchin. I just realized that you\u2019re reading Arnold\u2019s blog from within China. Does this mean that you can read everything posted at In My Tribe? In other words, are you aware of any censorship preventing you from reading his Substack? Sorry if my questions seem naive. I really don\u2019t know what the government of China tends to censor except what I hear in the media, typically about censorship on certain Apple products.\nSubstack is not (normally) available in China. Internet access is tightly controlled on everything. Let's just say that surprising numbers of Chinese are able to read and post whatever they want all over the internet. Censorship in China is vast topic, too much for me to get into here.\nThat\u2019s great news. Perhaps this is the most important fact about China in this entire post. It means that things in China will probably turn out better than we expect.\nI don't do hard predictions, especially on China and absolutely not in any internet comments section. But, Chinese are resilient. Get yourself ready for the 2nd China Shock, where China blows by everyone in automobile tech, EV tech in general, biotech, pharmaceuticals, robotics of every possible iteration, medical analytical equipment, and basically, every technological frontier of the future. They're so far out in front right now, it's shocking. Where it lands...everyone else can argue about it. They're in Warp Drive right now on the technologies of the future.\nI follow the Bryan Caplan school of investing in that I hold a globally diverse portfolio of index funds, including Vanguard\u2019s VEMAX, which is composed of 31% Chinese companies. So I hope you\u2019re correct, and not just for me and mine, but for everyone. Thanks for your perspective. Where can we find out more about the technological advances going on in China? What should we be reading?\nOn Substack... Read Kevin Walmsley, Robert Wu, Pekingnology, SCMP (South China Morning Post), China Talk, Baiguan, Kevin Xu, Got China Daily Briefing, China Thought Express, Sinification by Thomas des Garets Geddes, The US-China Perception Monitor, Xinhua (yeah, it's the mouthpiece for the Party, but it does contains real news)....jeez, it's hard to list all of it. .\nFor background, read \"China Emerging\" by Wu Xiaobo. There's some real nuggets in there. I heard he's gotten into a bit of trouble for some of the stuff in there.\nIf you want to understand governance in China, read \"From The Soil\" by Fei Xiaotong. You will struggle with it, but READ IT. If you get through it, you will start to understand why Western \"analysis\" of China is essentially nonsense. Not in the sense that it's lies and untruths, but that it is a pile of ahistorical decontextualized nonsense.\nAvoid falling into the idea that the WSJ and NYT are providing anything worth reading, and most of the thought leaders in the West, (Noah types) are worthless. Beyond worthless. Delusional on occasion. Generally, Western media is clueless on China. Painfully clueless.\nPer investing... I'm a moron. I own a small pile of Amazon that I bought for pennies because it seemed like a good idea and I own an apartment building in a good area. I have no idea if your China investments are solid or not. I know if you bought BYD before anyone knew about it, you'd be smiling. I know a few others, but like I said, I'm the last person you want to take investment advice from.\nIf demographics is destiny, China will age out before it is able to replace the US empire. So my next candidate is India, which has no resource curse, a highly successful diaspora, and a strong English tradition (in many senses). It may boil down to whether the US can continue to attract the best-and-brightest from around the world or reform its K-12 system...\nAs I ponder Dr. Kling\u2019s substack today, I have the Volleyball Nations League finals on and #8 China just took the first set from #1 Brazil before a happy and supportive Chinese crowd. However awful the repression within China, one gets the impression that a majority rof Chinese citizens are more or less content with Xi, the government, and the CCP, and confident in their nation\u2019s future. This seems born out even in anonymous polling where 60% of citizens apparently support the government. (https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/chinese-communist-party-support-lower-when-surveys-anonymous/ ) Indeed, the Chinese Communist Party has about 100 million members which alone would be a significant power base. And the repression perhaps seems targeted against Muslims and Hong Kong dissidents, whom are not significant components of the total population. (https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/repression-in-xis-china/ ).\nSo why does it appear that a stable mass of Chinese are willing to tolerate a political system that most of us on the outside would find intolerable? And does the answer to this question perhaps explain why China has yet to fail significantly and indeed to continue to grow in prestige and power?\nWell, my favorite hammer in the toolbox of political concepts is the principle of solidarity and so today I will wail on that nail in the Chinese context.\nYes, China has a strongly hierarchy with centralized control. But so does the Catholic Church and the United States. But like those other entities, the lower levels in the hierarchy exercise authority and offer citizens voice and participation.\nLet\u2019s start with how Section 5 of the constitution of China, \u201cLocal People\u2019s Congresses at All Levels and Local People\u2019s Governments at All Levels.\u201d (https://english.www.gov.cn/archive/lawsregulations/201911/20/content_WS5ed8856ec6d0b3f0e9499913.html ) establishes a countervailing bottom-up flow of power. Article 95 provides for local government, \u201cProvinces, cities directly under central government jurisdiction, counties, cities, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships and towns shall establish people\u2019s congresses and people\u2019s governments.\u201d Article 97 provides for direct election of officials at the base levels with people\u2019s congresses at higher levels choosing members of the next higher level, \u201cDeputies to the people\u2019s congresses of provinces, cities directly under central government jurisdiction and cities divided into districts shall be elected by the people\u2019s congresses at the next level down; deputies to the people\u2019s congresses of counties, cities not divided into districts, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships and towns shall be directly elected by their constituencies.\u201d There may indeed be top-down political control, but the local officials who do the day to day local work are not assigned by the central government.\nPerhaps much to the dismay of YIMBYs and the delight of NIMBYs local government\u2019s apparently extensive economic power and remit is set out in Article 99:\n\u201cArticle 99 Local people\u2019s congresses at all levels shall, within their administrative areas, ensure the observance and enforcement of the Constitution, laws and administrative regulations; they shall, according to the authority invested in them as prescribed by law, adopt and issue resolutions, and review and decide on local economic, cultural and public service development plans.\nLocal people\u2019s congresses at and above the county level shall review and approve the economic and social development plans and budgets of their administrative areas as well as reports on their implementation; they shall have the power to change or revoke inappropriate decisions made by their own standing committees.\nThe people\u2019s congresses of ethnic townships may, according to the authority invested in them as prescribed by law, take specific measures suited to ethnic characteristics.\u201d\nSo it would appear that with respect to local economic development, citizens of China have sovereignty somewhat similar to that of US citizens.\nThus, I would argue critiques of China based on a one-sided assessment of top-down centralized power may be failing to take into account the whole picture.\nMore importantly, highly decentralized Brazil who strongly realizes the principle of subsidiarity has taken the match from China 3-1 thus proving the validity or perhaps maybe offering symbolic support to this argument.\n\"Thus, I would argue critiques of China based on a one-sided assessment of top-down centralized power may be failing to take into account the whole picture.\"\nYes. You could expand that idea into several arenas concerning China.\nI'm feet on the ground in Wuhan, and generally speaking, there's much less \"in your face\" stuff from China's government than I experience in the US. Seriously. In fact, the Heritage Foundation, about 10 years ago, stopped with their analysis of the issue in their annual report because China scored better than America.\nWell, the 90% own their own homes appears to be true - which I confess surprised me, so thanks for that - but the 80% owning them free and clear is not.\nAnd even the first claim is misleading, since in urban areas - where 60%+ of the population now live - the GOVERNMENT owns the land underneath the home, not the homeowner.\nAnd in fact, mortgage debt is common.\nUnless you can show hard evidence for this 2nd claim. But pretty sure it don\u2019t exist.\nIt's impossible for me to say. Maybe someone else knows.\nI know Chinese do not like debt. Debt on consumer silliness is a young people phenomenon. I do know a lot of folks in China own their homes. I and my wife own a few. Income tax is incredibly low (low single digit %) and there is NO PROPERTY TAX. Everyone knows property tax is coming, but right now there isn't any property tax.\nThe Catholic church? Talk about an apples to oranges comparison. The Catholic church isn't in charge of the entire US government. Reading constitutions doesn't tell you much about how things work in practice even in so-called liberal Western countries, let alone in authoritarian regimes like China's. I bet the constitution for the Democratic Republic of North Korea sounds good on paper as well. And the principle of 'top-down bottom-up' is just an old idea borrowed from Soviet Communism, not some Chinese innovation evidencing democratization at the local level.\nWell there is no denying China's authoritarianism working hand in hand with strong centralized power as is only natural. But many observers describe elements of decentralization as well with local administration in areas in which locals can perform better than remote bureaucracies. An article in Nature states:\n\"Although hybrid forms of democracy that combine elements of Western democracy and authoritarianism are acknowledged as being possible, the debate over whether the Chinese political system fits the definition of democracy is still ongoing (Tang 2021). In the meantime, it appears that the benefits of traditional democracy are penetrating Chinese legal scholarship, policymaking, and lawmaking to a greater degree. Although the visible role of state structures in the PRC is well known (i.e., that they have historically tended toward centralisation and vertical power), the Chinese state has had to deal with increasingly multi-layered social changes, the decentralisation of the economy, and local governance in the post-reform era (Wu and Zhang, 2022).\nFrom a formal point of view, the Chinese legislator does not define the relationship between the concepts of GG [\"grassroots governance\"] and the concept of local self-government, which in a sense complicates the understanding of the subtleties of meaning that the Chinese legislator and the subjects of political initiative put into the definition of GG. However, based on the political documents of the CCP, it can be argued that this is about both issues of self-organisation and grassroots initiative, as well as the process of governance at the local level. Of interest in this regard is the relatively recent CCP political act \u201cOpinion of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Strengthening Grassroots Management Modernisation and Management Capacity (April 28, 2021) (Communist Party of China, 2021). The paper notes that GG is the cornerstone of national governance, and the overall promotion of township (street) and urban and rural community governance is a major project to realise the modernisation of the national governance system and governance capacity (Communist Party of China, 2021).\"\nFrom this and other articles, I get the impression that there might be some nuance to it all. But the bottom line is that every 5 years a couple thousand delegates to a new National People's Congress, China's supreme authority, are officially elected by local people's congresses at the provincial level. So China is not entirely a military type organization with authority flowing in one direction only.\nThe titles of the political documents of the CCP you cite remind me of George Orwell's 1984. Doublespeak. If you think the Chinese political system is actually some hybrid form of democracy, why don't you joint Kurt and go live there?\nYou couldn\u2019t pay me to visit there. I just want to understand why it seems like a majority of Chinese seem to appear content in a system that I would find intolerable.\n1) No history of democracy and political liberalization -- you don't miss what you and your ancestors never had?\n2) improving living standards and lots of employment opportunities?\n3) Freedom to move abroad (if you can find a country that will take you) acts as a safety valve?\n4) the majority of Chinese people prefer living in a country where ethnic Chinese people are the dominant majority and Chinese culture is dominant (they don't believe diversity is our strength)?\nI visited Hong Kong before the handover and eventually the takeover by the CCP. Interesting place, but I wouldn't want to live there either.\nThis is an interesting post. I consider it weaker than your average post, but the linked article is a good one and worth reading. Without firsthand experience of being in China, it\u2019s difficult to know what people are thinking and discussing there, but based on the Chinese people I\u2019ve met here, they are busy with two important activities: working hard and improving the welfare of their families\u2014similar to us.\nDo they have sufficient intellectual independence (and wealth) to create more political independence for themselves? My guess is yes. Things will continue to get better in China on average over the longterm.\nWhat can we do to help them? Certainly we should be pushing for free trade. Arnold, I know it might be mundane to discuss the merits of free trade, but maybe you can come up with a helpful post on this topic? Or something related to China\u2019s economy and culture? More links?\nEven the pro-globalist members of 'the blob' who have been the leading proponents of the idea that free trade with China will result in political liberalization in that country now acknowledge that this idea has been thoroughly discredited by actual experience. That should have been obvious from the start of the experiment with globalization. The Chinese Communist Party copied its governance model from the Soviet Communist Party, but as usual, the Chinese 'tweaked' the model, and they did so with the objective of fortifying the model against renegades who might undermine the CCP's monopoly on political power like Gorbachev. Free trade with China not only does not and cannot result in more political independence for Chinese citizens, but in fact it does the opposite by bolstering the existing Chinese political system and helping to maintain the political power of the CCP. This is one of the things that irks me about libertarians who whine about free trade and any interference in their ability to buy anything they want from an authoritarian country like China. At least have the honesty to admit that your principled libertarianism is somewhat hypocritical.\nI agree that trade has not resulted in the political liberalization that was expected. That doesn't mean it won't. And it doesn't mean it hasn't increased desire and readiness of the people.\nIf US traded with China less could we have realistically expected or forced that on the rest of the world? What if we were the only ones not trading with China?\nWere Gorbachev's actions expected when he took office? What will Xi's successor do?\nBelieving that US trade with China under its existing political system has the potential to result in political liberalization when it has failed to do so after decades of such trade meets the definition of insanity. As for Gorbachev, the CCP's system for selecting a successor to the Chairman is designed to weed out troublemaking political reformers like him. How they do that I can't say. In the Soviet case, I think Marxist-Leninist ideology was pretty much dead by the time Brezhnev croaked. I can't say the same about China. Today Trump issued an executive order closing the duty-free 'de minimus' loophole, which has allowed Chinese companies like Temu and Shein to flood the US market with low-cost junk. For all I know, reducing US trade with China has a better chance of resulting in political liberalization by putting millions of Chinese out of work and destabilizing the political system, although I'm not saying that is Trump's goal, just a potential side-effect.\nWhat specific trade policies do you advocate for between the US and China?\nThe critical thing to understand about the CCP is that they have closely studied the rise and fall of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union and they are bound and determined to avoid the latter's fate at all costs.\n\"Xi Jinping is reorienting China\u2019s economy around producing a bunch of stuff that Chinese people don\u2019t want or need, because this fits with his idea of what makes a country strong.\nThat is what industrial policy is all about, though, isn\u2019t it?\"\nNo, it making thing the world wants: Boeing Aircraft.\nHard to believe the comparison between Peter Turchin and Peter Zeihan.\nI\u2019ve listened to several of Peter Zeihan podcasts, and his arguments are riddled with factual errors and inaccuracies.\nEg here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UltVl2Qlf6A&t=314s he states that China \"imports 75-80% of its energy\" while the actual share of imported energy vs total consumed is ~20-25%. More appalling as he fashion himself as an expert of demography, on the same interview he states that China \"has more people > 53 than under\" (China's median age is 39).\nBeyond his clear ideological biases, he lacks any credentials that would qualify him as a legitimate expert.\nPeter Turchin on the other side is an rigorous and original scholar\n\"That is what industrial policy is all about, though, isn\u2019t it?\"\nI get that even if you think this is 100% true, there still is probably a bit of sarcasm in this comment but it's not true. It's also about funneling money to political friends.\nOk, that's some sarcasm too. But industrial policy can have some positives too, even if it doesn't always and they are harder to see than the flaws in execution.\nWhy is it surprising that the left-of-center, industrial policy fan, technocrat Noah Smith believes as Thomas Friedman does in the superiority of the benevolent dictator model?\nIf only Deng Xiaoping ran China forever, it would be the greatest country on earth.\n\ud83d\ude44\nThinking of the future of China and US and not factoring what happens with Taiwan might be found to be a bit lacking.\nUnited States has excelled the last hundred years because of all the discoveries made through our research institutes and research universities. China has realized this and has made a tremendous investment in research that will pay off. Already they may be ahead of us in some areas of research including AI and biomedical sciences are among the best in the world. At the same time we are beginning to disinvest in basic research and it will come back to haunt us. While China made lose its preeminence as the world manufacturer as its population ages is moving into highly lucrative areas where a relatively small portion of the population will make a big difference for it\n\u201cAlready they may be ahead of us in some areas of research including AI\u201d\nIdk about biomedical sciences.\nAnd idk what the further out future holds.\nBut suggesting that the Chinese may *already* be ahead of U.S. in AI is just stupid talk.\nThe success of DeepSeek may show that they are not as far behind as the consensus believed a year ago, but it is a MASSIVE step from there to the idea that they are ahead in AI.\nI realize you inserted the qualifier \u201cmay\u201d. Of course, I *may* be better than LeBron James at basketball\u2026\nDo you have ANY evidence at all for your claim that they may be ahead?!?"

  "argos_summary": "China\u2019s rapid growth has slowed but is still expected to outpace developed economies, though Xi Jinping\u2019s policies and governance constraints may temper future gains. The country\u2019s potential remains high because it can copy proven technologies and still catch up, but political and institutional limits\u2014such as heavy state intervention and debt\u2014could curb productivity. In contrast, the EU lags behind the U.S. due to rigid regulations and high restructuring costs, while the U.S. remains a leader in innovation and technology. Overall, China\u2019s future growth hinges on balancing state control with market dynamism and addressing debt and demographic challenges.",
