      "summary": "AI avatars are rapidly improving, with Synthesia’s latest model producing hyperrealistic, expressive clones that may soon converse with users, raising questions about authenticity and interaction. Meanwhile, Trump’s administration is rolling back clean‑energy subsidies and cutting funding for climate‑tech, a move that could further entrench China’s dominance in solar manufacturing and other renewable technologies. The combination of advancing AI personas and policy shifts underscores a broader trend of technological progress coupled with a retreat from supportive environmental measures.",
