      "summary": "HSBC stock has surged 33% YTD, driven by strong wealth‑management growth in Asia, stable trading income, and a $3 billion buyback that boosts dividends above 4%. Q2 2025 earnings fell 29% YoY due to impairment charges and higher credit losses, but revenue held steady at $16.5 billion and cost‑reduction plans aim to save $1.5 billion by 2026. The bank’s robust capital ratios and large deposit base mitigate risks from U.S. tariffs and potential Fed rate cuts, though a rate decline could compress net interest income.\n",
