      "summary": "Jobless claims rose in late August, reflecting a slowdown in private hiring amid tariff uncertainty, immigration restrictions, and AI adoption. The labor market’s softness may prompt the Federal Reserve to resume rate cuts at its September meeting, though inflation remains a concern. Trade data shows a widening U.S. goods deficit, driven by high tariffs and a surge in capital goods imports, adding further uncertainty for businesses.",
