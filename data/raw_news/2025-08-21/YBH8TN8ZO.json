  "content": "Alphabet Inc. is drawing heightened attention this week as investors await the Department of Justice\u2019s next move in its long-running antitrust battle. According to Yahoo! Finance, the U.S. District Court has already ruled that Google unlawfully maintained its dominance in online search and related advertising markets through exclusionary default agreements.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nAnalysts at BMO Capital warn that Alphabet\u2019s share price could swing by as much as 10% in either direction depending on the remedies imposed. Per Yahoo! Finance, Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue his decision shortly, aiming to resolve the matter before the launch of the government\u2019s separate Ad-Tech trial.\n\nRead more: Google Offers Play Store Changes to Avoid EU Penalties\n\nBMO Capital anticipates that the remedies will be meaningful but not extreme. The firm expects regulators to push for a broad behavioral consent decree rather than a forced breakup. Such a measure could restrict Google\u2019s practices around distribution agreements, data sharing, and competitive conduct, potentially extending to artificial intelligence operations. While divestitures of assets like Chrome or Android appear unlikely, the author notes that any restrictions could still weigh heavily on Google\u2019s core revenue streams and flexibility.\n\nThe greater threat, however, may lie in the upcoming Ad-Tech case. Analysts cited by Yahoo! Finance point out that this proceeding carries a much higher chance of a structural breakup, with a decision on remedies projected after September 2025. Combined, the two antitrust cases could expose Alphabet to a decade of heightened regulatory oversight, reshaping the competitive dynamics of search and digital advertising.",
