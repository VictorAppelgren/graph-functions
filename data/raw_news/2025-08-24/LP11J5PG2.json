  "content": "When Aaron Judge spoke to reporters following the Yankees\u2019 loss to the Red Sox on Saturday, he didn\u2019t have much information when it came to his throwing program.\n\nAsked when the slugger, limited to DH duties since returning from a right flexor strain, might return to right field in a game, Judge deferred to trainers. He offered the same response when asked when he might begin throwing to bases.\n\nTeam trainers are not made available to reporters, though.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s tough, then,\u201d said Judge, never eager to talk about his injuries or rehab timelines. He added, \u201cThey might have a good schedule for you.\u201d\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Judge began throwing to bases for the first time since his injury. With Yankees outfield coach Luis Rojas hitting fungoes, Judge threw to second base and a cut-off man before Sunday\u2019s series finale against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt felt just like playing catch,\u201d Judge said Sunday. \u201cIt felt good.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Aaron Boone said Judge looked good throwing. However, the manager still didn\u2019t have a target date for Judge\u2019s in-game return to the outfield.\n\nBoone also said it\u2019s too soon to know if Judge will be a full-time outfielder once he gets back out there.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we want to do this the right way,\u201d Boone said. \u201cAs much as he wants to be out there and we want him out there like, we gotta make sure we do everything possible to put ourselves in the best position to not re-injure this.\n\n\u201cWe certainly miss him out there. Hopefully we continue to take these steps, and we\u2019ll get him out there at some point.\u201d\n\nJudge graduated to base-throwing despite never throwing hard in front of reporters during the catch play and long toss portion of his throwing program, which has seen him stretch out to 150 feet. He continued to throw lightly on Sunday, though a few tosses came with added velocity.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was at 100%, but it was higher intensity [than playing catch],\u201d Judge said, adding that he was trying to treat the session like a game so that things don\u2019t speed up on him whenever he defends in a real contest. \u201cIt\u2019s just checking a box. If I can play catch at 150 feet, it\u2019s the same thing as me taking a ball and throwing it 150 feet in the direction of a base. So I think it\u2019s just about building it up and seeing what the trainers say here.\u201d\n\nJudge deferred to trainers again when asked how many more times he would have to work on base-throwing before playing the outfield.\n\nEarlier this week, Boone told WFAN that he didn\u2019t expect Judge to throw \u201cnormally\u201d again this season. The manager then walked that comment back, saying he may have overstated the situation.\n\nJudge, meanwhile, took issue with the manager\u2019s original assessment on WFAN.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he said that,\u201d Judge said at the time. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen me throw for the past two weeks, so I\u2019m pretty confident I\u2019ll get back to [100 percent].\u201d\n\nWhile the Yankees await Judge\u2019s in-game return to the outfield, the club is hoping to get some more offense out of the MVP candidate\u2019s bat.\n\nPrior to Sunday\u2019s series finale against the Red Sox, Judge had hit just .218 over 16 games since coming off the injured list, though he had an .804 OPS to go along with three home runs and seven RBI.\n\nJudge said that he doesn\u2019t feel his flexor strain is impacting him at the plate.\n\nHe also said that not being able to play defense has been \u201cbrutal,\u201d as he knows he can help the Yankees on both sides of the ball.\n\nJudge declined to say if he\u2019s been telling the team he\u2019s ready to play right, but he also noted, \u201cI think they all know I want to be back out there.\u201d",

  "summary": "Aaron Judge, a Yankees player who has been limited to DH duties since returning from a right flexor strain, began throwing to bases for the first time since his injury on Saturday following a loss to the Red Sox. Despite not being able to play defense, Judge has expressed confidence in his ability to help the team on both sides of the ball. Despite starting his throwing program, manager Aaron Boone has not yet set a target date for Judge's in-game return to the outfield. It is too soon to know if Judge will be a full-time outfielder once he is back, as he hasn't seen him throw for the past two weeks.
