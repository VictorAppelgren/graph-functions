  "content": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem temporarily relocated her personal residence as she\u2019s facing an increase in threats against her and \u201cvicious doxxing,\u201d a department spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Friday.\n\n\u201cFollowing the media\u2019s publishing of the location of Secretary Noem\u2019s Washington D.C. apartment, she has faced vicious doxxing on the dark web and a surge in death threats, including from the terrorist organizations, cartels, and criminal gangs that DHS targets.\n\nDue to threats and security concerns, she has been forced to temporarily stay in secure military housing,\u201d Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. \u201cSecretary Noem continues to pay rent for her Navy Yard residence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the media chooses sensationalism over the safety of people enforcing America\u2019s laws to keep Americans safe,\u201d McLaughlin added.\n\nNoem said last week that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents \u201care now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they risk their lives to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down. Everyday our law enforcement continues to enforce the law and arrest the most depraved criminals including pedophiles, terrorists, murderers, gang members, and sexual predators,\u201d she added in a post on X.\n\nIn July, Fox News Digital reported that ICE officials faced an 830% increase in assaults between Jan. 21, 2025 and July 14, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nThat timeframe began the day after President Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office.",

      "text": "People with multiple sclerosis (MS) may show warning signs long before classic symptoms appear \u2014 and mental health concerns could be among the first red flags, according to new research.\nA University of British Columbia (UBC) study, published last week in JAMA Network Open, examined the medical records of 2,038 patients with the autoimmune disease and compared them to 10,182 patients without it.\nThe researchers found that future MS patients had elevated rates of mental health-related issues, psychiatrist and general practice visits, and complaints of vague symptoms such as fatigue and pain \u2014 all as early as 15 years before the onset of clear symptoms.\nMAKING THESE 11 LIFESTYLE CHANGES COULD WARD OFF ALZHEIMER'S, EXPERT SAYS\n\"These findings suggest that MS may begin much earlier than previously recognized, with mental health\u2013related issues as early indicators,\" the researchers wrote.\nMS, which attacks the protective myelin coating around nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, affects about one million adults in the U.S., according to Cleveland Clinic.\nWhile there is no known cause or cure, treatment can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease, which can cause muscle weakness, vision changes, numbness and memory issues.\nPrevious research has shown that in the five to 10 years leading up to an MS diagnosis, people typically seek medical attention more frequently for headaches, fatigue, sleep disorders, pain, gastrointestinal issues and psychiatric concerns, the researchers wrote.\nALWAYS RUNNING LATE? A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION COULD BE TO BLAME, EXPERTS SAY\nThe UBC study, however, tracked physician visits in the 25 years leading up to the onset of symptoms in MS patients in British Columbia.\nThey found a steady uptick in general practice visits starting 15 years out, followed by more frequent trips to psychiatrists beginning 12 years before symptoms.\nNeurology and ophthalmology visits increased eight to nine years prior, likely due to blurred vision or eye pain, two common early symptoms of MS.\nThree to five years before onset, emergency room and radiology visits rose sharply. Across nearly every specialty, physician visits peaked in the year before symptoms began.\nPsychiatrist consultations, in particular, skyrocketed 159% before MS onset, and mental health visits increased 76%, according to the research.\nThe increase in psychiatric visits may correlate to the earliest stages of MS-related immune dysregulation, as higher levels of certain inflammation-related chemicals and problems with the blood-brain barrier can affect mood, the researchers noted.\nImproving outcomes\nWhile most people who experience mental health issues, fatigue and headaches do not develop MS, the researchers said that recognizing and characterizing the \"prodromal phase\" \u2014 the early period marked by subtle symptoms \u2014 could speed up diagnosis and improve outcomes.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"Mental health and psychiatric-related issues may be among the earliest features of the prodromal phase of MS, preceding nervous system-related symptoms and neurologist visits by several years,\" senior author Dr. Helen Tremlett, professor of neurology at UBC, told Fox News Digital.\n\"This suggests that in the future, there may be an opportunity to recognize and manage MS early, maximizing mental health and brain reserve,\" she said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe findings also open \"new avenues for research into early biomarkers, lifestyle factors and other potential triggers that may be at play during this previously overlooked phase of the disease,\" the researcher added.\nMonitoring for early warning signs could also potentially help to detect other brain diseases, like Alzheimer\u2019s or ALS, and ensure early intervention, Tremlett noted.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\nBetween 2016 and 2021, MS cases increased globally from about 2.2 million to as many as 2.9 million, according to research published in July in the journal Frontiers in Neurology.\nThe disease has gained public attention in recent years as celebrities like Selma Blair, Christina Applegate and Montel Williams have shared their experiences of living with MS."

The feds say members of the Hoover gang brazenly posted pictures on social media with stacks of cash, designer clothes and cars to lure vulnerable women into sex work with the promise of a lavish lifestyle.\nInstead, the 150-page criminal complaint says women ended up enslaved in a human trafficking enterprise in which they were mercilessly beaten, raped and sold for sex.\n16 IN CUSTODY AFTER IMMIGRATION RAID AT LA HOME DEPOT, DHS SAYS\nOperation Broken Blade successfully took into custody 10 out of 11 of its targets. One suspect, 31-year-old Bryan Isrel managed to flee and remains at large \u2013 but Isrel is considered a fugitive by the DOJ, which is actively searching for him.\nFederal investigators say a female, Amaya Armstead, who goes by the street name \"Lady Duck\" was a lead target and prolific human trafficker. Armsted's moniker Lady Duck is even tattooed on at least four victim's bodies.\nAOC'S 'RED LIGHT' DISTRICT RULED BY VIOLENT MIGRANT GANG TAKEN DOWN BY FEDS\nThe criminal complaint alleges one instance when: \"Armstead posted a video of herself beating a woman in a convenience store, holding her down by the hair and repeatedly kicking and kneeing her ...The woman shouts that she\u2019s pregnant, but defendant ARMSTEAD continues to beat her.\"\nAt a downtown motel, which the Feds allege is a site that the gang uses to sell women and minors, federal agents surrounded one of their eleven suspects and took him into custody.\n2 ARRESTED AT LA HOME LINKED TO IRANIAN 'HUMAN SMUGGLING HUB': CBP\nPolice say during the operation they also rescued four victims, including a minor.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe defendants are charged with various crimes including sex trafficking of minors, sex trafficking through force, fraud, or coercion; drug trafficking and gun charges, according to the criminal complaint.

They will then be gradually deployed across the country.\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re going to need additional vehicles as we build out our workforce, so there\u2019ll be some marked vehicles from here in DC and around the country,\u201d an ICE insider told The Post.\nBut agents \u2014 who are dealing with a 1,000% increase in assaults by illegal immigrants and anti-ICE activists \u2014 say they\u2019re concerned that this will further expose them to dangerous threats.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a bullseye,\u201d said one ICE source.\n\u201cThis will only raise officer-involved incidents in the streets because people will target the vehicles,\u201d said another agency source, adding that agitators have already successfully \u201cimpeded operations.\u201d\nThe sources described scary incidents in which activists have slashed tires and hurled projectiles at their cars.\nAgents already wear masks to shield their identities and dress in street clothes while making arrests \u2014 a practice that has come under scrutiny as the Trump administration ramps up its mass deportation effort.\n\u201cThey won\u2019t let us do our jobs,\u201d a source explained of the anti-ICE agitators.\nIt was not clear how many vehicles ICE will deploy nationwide or how much the new fleet will cost. However, the Department of Homeland Security said agency\u2019s new wheels come after it received an influx of cash from the One Big Beautiful Bill.\n\u201cICE is a law enforcement agency, and like all other law enforcement agencies has a fleet of vehicles that includes those with ICE branding. Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE finally has the resources to grow its workforce to support ICE\u2019s mission, and that will include all types of additional vehicles,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told The Post.\n\u201cThese specific vehicles will supplement the existing ICE fleet and support operations across the country,\u201d she added.\nMcLaughlin also defended the department\u2019s commitment to the safety of its agents.\n\u201cThe safety and security of our brave men and women is, and always has been, our priority, and suggestions that law enforcement branded vehicles, no different from police vehicles, will jeopardize that is simply not the case,\u201d she said.\nThe fleet will be used in arrest operations but will not be utilized in undercover surveillance missions that are often conducted before an illegal immigrant target is collared, an ICE insider said.\nThe imminent rollout of the new SUVs in DC comes as President Trump seized control of the city\u2019s police department in an effort to crack down on crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cWe are here with a large presence in DC following the president\u2019s announcement on Monday \u2026 we have additional officers and teams here in DC for the foreseeable future. You will be seeing a larger presence around the city as we make DC safe again,\u201d said an ICE insider.\nOn Wednesday night, immigration agents with the agency set up a checkpoint on 14th Street in Northwest DC that quickly drew a crowd of unruly protesters.\n\u201cWhy are you here? You are trying to arrest innocent people? What\u2019s your purpose? What\u2019s your goal? What\u2019s the motive? Why won\u2019t you show your face? Do you look yourself in the mirror and think \u2018I did a good job today\u2019?\u201d one protester was heard yelling at officers, according to Fox News.\nSome of the demonstrators were also heard encouraging drivers to \u201cturn left\u201d to avoid the checkpoint altogether, the outlet reported."

Geoff Fahringer warns that drink spiking is an opportunistic crime that thrives on distraction and offered simple, proactive steps to protect yourself.\n\"The first thing that comes to mind is that college students have to realize is that they're not at home anymore. They're not in that maybe much safer environment of a gated community or a small town, and they really have to change their mindset to a safety awareness mindset,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nDC VIOLENCE HAS GROWN FAR MORE DEADLY, DESPITE DEMS CLAIMING 30-YEAR LOW\nNashville's concerns meet national trend\nRecent reports from NewsNation and 6ABC highlight a disturbing pattern. Patrons suspect their drinks are being tampered with in bars, nightclubs and campus settings. In Nashville, home to a booming nightlife and a steady stream of college students, police and advocates say awareness is the first line of defense.\n\"If you live in Nashville, you need to listen up. I'm not the first person to say this. If you go out \u2014 especially on Broadway, especially as a woman \u2014 you need to be super careful,\" @alnewton17 said in a viral TikTok video. \"Being roofied is happening all the time.

If you\u2019re walking through a parking lot with your cell phone in your hand, totally oblivious, you\u2019re the weak deer in the herd to the pack of coyotes,\" he said.\nFahringer's top prevention tips:\n- Only drink what you\u2019ve poured or opened yourself\n- Watch each other\u2019s backs when at a dorm party, a college bar or a house party\n- Use a safe word to let friends know you\u2019re uncomfortable\n- Stay situationally aware, especially in loud and crowded venues.\n- Plan an escape route, if needed\nRecent studies suggest drink spiking is far from rare. According to Psychology of Violence, which surveyed over 6,000 students at a variety of campuses, about 1 in 13 college students report being drugged or suspect they were. Of the students who reported being drugged, 79% were female.\nSexual assault was more common for female victims than for male victims, the study found. For example, 17% of female victims reported having unwanted sex, compared with 6% of male victims.\nFemale victims were also more likely to report blacking out, with 74% reporting blacking out, compared to 51% of male victims, according to the study.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHave a plan before trouble starts\nFahringer said crafting a plan before getting into a sticky situation is the best tool for prevention.\n\"Being a deer in the headlights is not your plan,\" he said. \"Have a little strategy, talk with your friends and know what you'll do if something starts going wrong.\""

      "text": "Sen. Marsha Blackburn unveils bill to shield law enforcement from doxxing as Dems push to out ICE agents\nTennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn rolled out legislation Wednesday to make the doxxing of law enforcement officials illegal after multiple Democrats \u2014 including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries \u2014 have pushed to identify Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carrying out the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts.\nUnder the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act, those who release the name of an officer \u201cwith the intent to obstruct a criminal investigation or immigration enforcement operation\u201d could face up to five years behind bars and a fine.\n\u201cBlue city mayors are doing everything they can to obstruct the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to deport criminal illegal aliens,\u201d Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said in a statement.\nHer new bill is a direct response to Democratic Nashville Mayor Freddie O\u2019Connell after it emerged that his office had been keeping track of engagement between ICE authorities and local officials. O\u2019Connell has framed the effort as a transparency push.\nO\u2019Connell\u2019s team publicly released details of those interactions, including names of feds on a city website, before local officials removed some of the names.\nThe mayor\u2019s actions came against the backdrop of a massive ICE operation last month in partnership with the Tennessee Highway Patrol in which nearly 200 people were detained.\nOf those detained, at least 95 have previous criminal convictions and 31 had reentered the US illegally, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\nO\u2019Connell had been a fierce critic of the operation \u2014 and even amplified a fundraiser for the families of people who had been swept up by the ICE operations.\n\u201cJust last week, Nashville Mayor O\u2019Connell and his office doxxed federal law enforcement officers after the Trump administration worked with Tennessee Highway Patrol to arrest criminal illegal aliens,\u201d Blackburn said.\n\u201cMy Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act would make this illegal and hold blue city mayors accountable for obstructing enforcement of our immigration laws by putting law enforcement officers in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\nThe Nashville mayor is not the only one seeking to name ICE agents.\nOn Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) vowed to fight to name ICE agents engaged in wrongful conduct, amid gripes about them wearing masks.\n\u201cEvery single ICE agent who\u2019s engaged in this aggressive overreach and are trying to hide their identities from the American people will be unsuccessful in doing that,\u201d Jeffries declared Tuesday. \u201cThis is America. This is not the Soviet Union.\n\u201cAnd every single one of them, no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes, will be identified.\u201d\nBlackburn\u2019s stipulates that the release of law enforcement names must be done \u201cwith the intent to obstruct\u201d criminal investigations or immigration operations in order to be considered a criminal offense.\nJeffries\u2019 remarks come days after Democrats fumed over the temporary detention of a Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) aide by DHS agents last week.\nActing ICE Director Todd Lyons has said that ICE agents have been wearing masks to protect themselves as they find themselves apprehending suspects gangbangers from brutal groups like MS-13 or Tren de Aragua and other potentially violent criminals.\nOfficers have faced a 413% spike in assaults, per the DHS.\nBlackburn is currently mulling a run for Tennessee governor in 2026. Two of her Senate colleagues, Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) and Michael Bennett (D-Colo.) have announced gubernatorial runs in their respective states."

Due to threats and security concerns, she has been forced to temporarily stay in secure military housing,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. \"Secretary Noem continues to pay rent for her Navy Yard residence.\n\"It\u2019s a shame that the media chooses sensationalism over the safety of people enforcing America\u2019s laws to keep Americans safe,\" McLaughlin added.\nNoem said last week that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents \"are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they risk their lives to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.\"\nNOEM SAYS ICE AGENTS ARE FACING '1000% INCREASE IN ASSAULTS'\n\"We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down. Everyday our law enforcement continues to enforce the law and arrest the most depraved criminals including pedophiles, terrorists, murderers, gang members, and sexual predators,\" she added in a post on X.\nIn July, Fox News Digital reported that ICE officials faced an 830% increase in assaults between Jan. 21, 2025 and July 14, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThat timeframe began the day after President Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office."

A UBC study published in JAMA Network Open finds that mental\u2011health complaints and psychiatric visits can precede multiple sclerosis symptoms by up to 15 years, suggesting an earlier prodromal phase.  In Los Angeles, a joint DOJ\u2011LAPD operation dismantled a sex\u2011trafficking gang that exploited minors, arresting 10 of 11 suspects.  Other stories in the piece include ICE\u2019s plan to roll out brightly branded vehicles, concerns over drink\u2011spiking on college campuses, a South Park episode mocking Noem, and a Tennessee bill that would criminalize the doxxing of law\u2011enforcement officials.",
