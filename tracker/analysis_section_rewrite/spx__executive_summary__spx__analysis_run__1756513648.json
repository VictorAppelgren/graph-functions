      "feedback": "Your draft is already on the right track but drifts slightly on the Fed‑rate‑cut line, which is only tangentially relevant to TSLA and lacks a clear causal link. Remove the sentence “The Fed’s 25‑bp rate‑cut signal at the next FOMC would reduce the Fed funds rate by 25 bp, easing discount rates and potentially supporting equity valuations” or rewrite it to explicitly tie the cut to TSLA’s valuation (e.g., “A 25‑bp cut would lower discount rates, lifting TSLA’s DCF‑based fair value by ~2‑3 %”). Tighten the remaining sentences to 5–6 concise bullets: 1) TSLA’s current price & recent swing; 2) Key catalysts (Q3 earnings, lawsuit verdict, NHTSA probe) with explicit % impact ranges; 3) Fed policy as a backdrop that could amplify or dampen those catalysts; 4) Base‑case valuation range with margin/earnings assumptions; 5) Watch items and risk thresholds. Ensure every claim has an inline citation (e.g., (LJZYDXVL3), (B1KYJ1GPU)) and that you reference canonical handles (TSLA, NDX, SPX) where appropriate. This will satisfy the 4–6 sentence limit, maintain a clear causal chain, and keep the brief tightly focused on TSLA.",
