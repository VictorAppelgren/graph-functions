  "title": "500,000 Retirees in Mississippi Qualify for the 'Senior Deduction' Under Big, Beautiful Bill",
  "description": "Roughly 500,000 Mississippi retirees are set to benefit from a new federal deduction that exempts most Social Security income from taxes starting in 2026.",
  "content": "Through the introduction of a deduction afforded only to seniors, roughly 500,000 retirees in Mississippi are expected to avoid federal income tax on their Social Security benefits-offering real financial relief for many living on fixed incomes.\n\nWhat the senior deduction means for retirees in America\n\nA major feature of the OBBBA is the new senior-specific deduction: $6,000 for individuals and $12,000 for married couples age 65 and older. When stacked with the boosted standard deduction and existing senior deductions, this tax reform ensures that 88% of seniors will not pay federal tax on their Social Security checks-an increase from 64% under previous law.\n\nThe White House has described this senior deduction as \"the largest tax break in history for America's seniors,\" saying the policy was created to help retirees \"save more of their money\" after decades of contributing to Social Security.\n\nHalf a million seniors in Mississippi are expected to benefit\n\nMississippi is home to approximately 516,000 residents aged 65 and older, making up roughly 17.5% of the state's nearly 3 million residents, according to the most recent census data. This group represents around 0.9% of the total senior population in the U.S. According to federal estimates, 500,000 Mississippi retirees are expected to qualify for the new Social Security tax exemption.\n\nThe law is also expected to increase workers' real wages by $2,800 to $5,000, and raise take-home pay between $6,400 and $8,700. These inflation-adjusted gains could indirectly benefit aging households, especially those supported by younger family members.\n\nIn addition to tax relief, Mississippi will receive 2,500 new housing units through Opportunity Zone investment-projects aimed at boosting development in low-income communities. These units may offer additional options for retirees in need of affordable or multi-generational housing.\n\nWhile the deduction will benefit many, it's important for retirees to know that it doesn't apply universally. The benefit is not a refundable credit, so retirees who already pay no federal income tax-such as those with limited income-will not see additional savings.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, high-income seniors are excluded. The deduction begins phasing out at $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples, disappearing entirely at $175,000 and $250,000.\n\nThat makes middle-income retired homeowners the most likely to benefit-particularly those facing growing costs for property taxes, utilities, or insurance. Combined with the quadrupled SALT (state and local tax) deduction cap-up from $10,000 to $40,000-the senior deduction may offer welcome relief.\n\nAlthough the deduction is a substantial shift in retirement tax policy, it's only authorized through the 2028 tax year. Unless Congress renews it, the benefit could sunset, making early planning essential for retirees who want to maximize their savings.\n\nFor now, the OBBBA's senior deduction could help thousands of Mississippi retirees hold onto more of their income and stay in the homes they've worked to keep.",
