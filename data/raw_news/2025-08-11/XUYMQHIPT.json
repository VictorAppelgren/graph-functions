  "title": "IRS Wins Two More Microcaptive Tax Shelter Cases In Kadau And CFM",
  "description": "About the U.S. Tax Court opinions in Kadau and CFM Insurance which involve 831(b) microcaptive tax shelters",
  "content": "In two opinions issued just four days apart, the IRS has won two more cases involving risk-pooled 831(b) captive insurance companies, known as microcaptives. The opinions were issued in Kadau v. CIR, T.C. Memo. 2025-81 (July 31, 2025), which you can read here, and CFM Insurance, Inc. v. CIR, T.C. Memo. 2025-83 (August 4, 2025), which you can read here.\n\nThe Kadau case involved an engineering company that paid premiums to its affiliated captive. The captive manager was RMC, which I wrote about in my article, Captive Manager Avoids 6700 Penalties After Jury Trial (April 13, 2024). The actuary was Marn Rivelle, a very nice guy but also who seems to feature frequently in these losses to the IRS. Because the underlying business could not otherwise meet the risk distribution requirements for a captive insurance company, it participated in a risk pool known as RMC Property, which of course was affiliated with the RMC group of companies.\n\nThe Kadau captive failed for tax purposes for pretty much the same reasons that we see in all of these captive cases, i.e., the \"reinsurance\" agreement through the RMC risk pool provided little more than a circulation of the funds back to the owner of the business paying the premiums, the captive was undercapitalized for the risks that it was purportedly taking on, the premiums were not properly calculated in any realistic actuarial sense, the policies issued were kind of a joke once the terms were scrutinized, and were unreasonable, and the like. Worse, the captive's primary investment was a life insurance policy on the taxpayer, which indicated that the real purpose of the arrangement was for the owners of the operating business to dodge taxes. However, the taxpayers were able to dodge additional taxes because the IRS lost on its argument that the captive's 953(d) election (for a foreign insurance company) had failed.\n\nNonetheless, the Tax Court found that the taxpayers did not reasonably rely upon RMC and Rivelle so as to avoid penalties, although the Tax Court indicated that it would defer a ruling as to whether the taxpayers would pay the 20% inaccuracy penalty or the 40% gross valuation misstatement penalty.\n\nThe other opinion, as indicated above, was from the CFM Insurance case. Owners of a Chicago grocery store chain created a Utah captive to cover a variety of risks related to the company, which risks were arguably more legitimate than those found in probably all the other microcaptive cases to date. The problem was that to handle these risks, the owners of the grocery stores ended up using Artex Risk Solutions, a division of Arthur J. Gallagher, to set up their captive \u2015 and Artex has also appeared in more than its fair share of these microcaptive cases where the taxpayers got slammed.\n\nNonetheless, the captive seems to have been more legitimate than most microcaptives. There wasn't a bogus risk pool involved to make things easy for the Tax Court. The actuarial calculations bore some resemblance to reality within the insurance market place, the grocery store chain really did have substantial risks that needed to be covered by insurance, and there were enough of these risks to get the captive over the \"points of insurance\" a/k/a \"risk exposures\" threshold, which pretty much never happens with a microcaptive. Indeed, the Tax Court found that there was approximately 4.5 million such exposure units which was sufficient to get the captive's underwriting well into the that Valhalla of insurance tax law known as the Law Of Large Numbers. Even the premium calculations were held to be reasonable, which is a first in these microcaptive cases. \"So far, so good!\"\n\nSaid the man falling from a skyscraper as he passed the 30th floor plummeting downwards. Alas, the captive here also ended with a thud and a bloody mess on the pavement.\n\nEven though the premiums were reasonable in amount, the way the premiums were paid was shoddy at best. The premiums charged by the captive were not paid by the grocery store chain until December of their year of issuance, which violated the terms of the policies issued (except for the 2015 premium, which although also paid in December did not violate the policies since by then the requirement had been eliminated).\n\nBut the payment of the policies paled in significance to when the policies were issued. For 2012 and 2015, the policies were not issued by the captive until the policy period had ended, and for 2013 the policies were not issued until only four days before the policy period expired. For 2014, there were five months remaining in the annual policy period before the policies were issued, but the Tax Court did not find this to be timely. While there were binders issued for the policies, these expired after 150 days and that time seems to have passed before the policies were issued.\n\nThe drafting of the captive policies was at best sophomoric. Key terms were frequently left undefined and often criteria was missing to determine if a covered claim had occurred at all. The key supplier policy did not define who as a key supplier. The reputational risk policy did not specify the instances when a reputation was damaged. They key employee policies did not define a category of key employees. Continuing on, the Tax Court noted:\n\n\"And then there was the business-interruption DIC policy. The 2014 policy provided coverage for a long list of events but did not define any of the terms used, including 'economic sanctions' and 'denial of access' in the 2014 policy. Most alarming is that the 2014 and the 2015 business-interruption DIC policies purported to cover losses from terrorism, pollution, and dishonest acts by employees, but also included a blanket exclusion for claims based on those very conditions.\" (Emphasis added).\n\nAlthough rating it as a neutral factor, the Tax Court also found that the captive's claims-handling practices were also shoddy.\n\nThe next set of facts reviewed by the Tax Court were also pretty ugly. One such set of facts went to the owner's understanding of the captive relationship. As the Tax Court noted:\n\n\"While CFM was managed by Artex, Presta was the 50% owner and president of the company. He testified at trial that he knew little of the operations\u2014he even forgot that he had appointed himself as CFM\u2019s president. We don\u2019t think that outsourcing the operation of a captive undercuts in all cases the characterization of a company as an insurance company, but when the president of the company doesn\u2019t even know that he is the president, something is off.\"\n\nUltimately, the Tax Court found that the captive arrangement here was \"a much closer call than is usual in microcaptive cases,\" but it still fell short of being an insurance arrangement for tax purposes. Because of that, the 831(b) election made by the captive would be held ineffective and the premium payments made to the captive would not be deemed as \"insurance\". Further, the taxpayers would not be allowed to recharacterize the payments made to the captive as a loss reserve, since the apparent purpose of the captive arrangement when it was formed was to avoid the taxes that would have been payable for a mere loss reserve.\n\nSo the taxpayers in CFM lost their deduction, but what about penalties? The Tax Court held that the taxpayers had relied on their own independent CPA for advice about the tax treatment of their captive and that their reliance was reasonable under the circumstances. Thus, no penalties.\n\nThe difference in the two cases is that in Kadau the taxpayers simply relied upon the promoter of the captive (and thus promoter of the tax shelter) and its hired actuary as to the proper tax treatment, whereas the taxpayers in the CFM case undertook the wise decision to ask their CPA about the taxation of the arrangement. The Kadau taxpayers ended up paying penalties and the CFM taxpayers did not. That is the primary difference of these two cases.\n\nOtherwise, both cases are alike in the sense that it is not so much the formation of the captive and how it is licensed that matters so much as it is how the captive is operated after that. The Kadau captive arrangement involved a risk pool, which has repeatedly proven to be pretty much an automatic loss in all of these cases, and also invested in life insurance policies which make no sense for a captive. While the CFM captive arrangement surprisingly (if not shockingly) got the premium payments right and had sufficient risk points to meet risk distribution, the shoddy if not outright shambolic running of the captive in terms of policy issuance and payment was its doom.\n\nThus, a loss is a loss is a loss, although the CFM taxpayers avoiding penalties was sort of a consolation prize for getting many things right and not just outright imploding like so many of these deals.\n\nCan any microcaptive arrangement get past the Tax Court? Not holding my breath, but the CFM opinion indicates that there are some such arrangements out there which have a better chance than others.\n\nOn the other hand, and as numerous decisions including now Kadau indicate, 831(b) risk-pooled microcaptives are simply dead on arrival at the U.S. Tax Court.",

  "summary": "The US Treasury Department (IR) has won two more cases involving risk-pooled captive insurance companies, known as microcaptives. The decisions were made in Kadau v. CIR, T.C. Memo. 2025-81 (July 31, 2025), and CFM Insurance, Inc. v. 1925-83 (August 4, 2025). The Kadau case involved an engineering company that paid premiums to its affiliated captive, RMC Property, which was affiliated with the RMC group of companies. The captive failed for tax purposes for various reasons including undercapitalization, inadequate actuarial calculations, and the policies issued were unreasonable. However, the Tax Court found that taxpayers did not reasonably rely upon RMC and Rivelle to avoid penalties. The other case involved a Chicago grocery store chain using Artex Risk Solutions to cover various risks related to the company.",

      "text": "Back in 2016, when the IRS issued Notice 2016-66 that designated certain microcaptive insurance arrangements as \"transactions of interest,\" I predicted that eventually there would be promoter examinations of at least some of the captive managers of captive insurance companies that had made the 831(b) election and were meeting risk distribution through risk pools, and that these promoter exams would result in the assessment of tax shelter penalties, a/k/a 6700 penalties (named after the Revenue Code section where those penalties are found). In 2021, I wrote about microcaptive promoter Celia Clark \u2014 who had featured prominently in several of the U.S. Tax Court opinions where the microcaptive owners had all lost and badly \u2014 being assessed such penalties and that she had filed a refund lawsuit, as related in my article, Former Microcaptive Promoter Sues IRS After Being Assessed With $11 Million In Section 6700 Penalties (Dec. 11, 2021). Ms. Clark and the IRS eventually settled that case on undisclosed terms, but at any rate that was only the start of the IRS's activity against microcaptive promoters.\nNext up was Mr. Raymond Ankner of Naples, Florida, who was a life actuary (but not a property & casualty actuary), who indirectly through three of his affiliated companies called CJA & Associates, Inc., RMC Property & Casualty, Ltd., and RMC Consultants, Ltd., provided captive management and related services (including a risk pool to distribute risk for tax purposes) to microcaptive arrangements. In short, the IRS assessed 6700 penalties against Ankner and his three companies, and to avoid those penalties they filed a refund lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. This case did not settle, however, and instead went to a trial before a jury. In the end, the jury entered a verdict in favor of Ankner and his companies and against the IRS on all counts.\nAs this was a jury verdict on the facts and not the judge's ruling on matters of law, there are no biting technical issues to discuss here. Readers who desire to know more about this case can read the following documents, in addition to the rest of the court documents that can be obtained through PACER:\n\u00b7 Answer To Amended Complaint And Counterclaim\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\u00b7 Order On Motion For Summary Judgment\nWhat follows now are purely my musings upon this case and the verdict. As always, to the extent my musings differ in any way from those contained in the documents filed in the case, the latter control.\nMy first thought on hearing about this case was \"Who the heck is Ray Ankner?\" I had never heard of him or his companies, although I have been involved in one form or another with the captive insurance industry since the mid-1990s. It seems that Ankner was not a high-profile marketer of microcaptives, but rather flew under the radar screen for years before popping up in this case. Not being a high-profile marketer was very likely a fact in his favor, as opposed to some of the other microcaptive promoters who had sizeable and aggressive marketing staff and were as visible on the radar as the Goodyear blimp. So the fact that I had never before heard of Ray Ankner before merits a \"well done\" to him for not getting the reputation as an aggressive marketer or microcaptives. Doubtless, this helped him at trial indirectly.\nMost importantly, at least as I see it, is that as of this date none of the microcaptive clients of Ankner and his companies have lost in the U.S. Tax Court, at least so far as I am aware. The importance of this cannot be overstated, since in the Tax Court opinions we have seen so far there was an abundance of evidence which came out during the trial about captive managers doing everything from convincing their affiliated actuaries to fudge the premium numbers, to backdating documents, and to utterly ignoring the economic realities about what was going on. But there was no record (again, at least as far as I am aware) of Ankner and his companies engaging in any such misconduct.\nAll of this is important because to assess the 6700 penalties, the IRS must demonstrate that a promoter acted with scienter, which basically means that they were taking actions that they knew to be wrong. In the Tax Court opinions so far, there has been an abundance of evidence of the involved captive managers intentionally doing shady things, but there doesn't seem to have been much of any such evidence in this case.\nThink of it this way: A jury consisting of ordinary folks will upon being told about complicated captive arrangements, risk shifting, risk distribution, and the technical aspects about what does or does not constitute a tax shelter, will probably cause to folks to get lost in the weeds pretty quickly. It is very hard for even experienced financial professionals to grasp these concepts, much less a conglomerate of folks whose sole qualifications to serve on a federal jury is that they be registered voters.\nBy contrast, things like backdating documents or telling somebody to fudge numbers is something that even the least financially savvy juror can sink their teeth into pretty quickly. This type of evidence has existed in abundance in the Tax Court cases so far, but there doesn't seem to have been any of it in the case of Ankner and his companies. The upshot is that the IRS will have a much easier time making their promoter penalties case against a microcaptive manager who had at least one client blow up in the Tax Court, and a correspondingly worse chance if that same manager has never had a client even suffer a judgment before the Tax Court.\nThis doesn't mean that the IRS could not win a promoter penalty case without a taxpayer blowing up in Tax Court, far from it. What it does mean is that if there hasn't been a Tax Court case, the IRS had better have developed a boatload of admissible evidence that the microcaptive manager undoubtedly knew that what they were doing was wrong.\nThis is probably not the last such 6700 penalty case that we will see, and there are certainly much easier targets for the IRS to go after when it comes to microcaptive managers, including a few whose clients have indeed blown up (and \"they blow'd up real good\" in the words of the late Billy Sol Hurok). There is no reason for the IRS to settle those cases where the microcaptive manager had been caught in some sort of obvious mischief, so we will probably see more trials and some verdicts that go the other way.\nStay tuned."

In Kadau, the Tax Court ruled against the taxpayers due to inadequate risk distribution and improper premium calculations, resulting in penalties. Conversely, while CFM's captive arrangement appeared more legitimate with reasonable premiums and sufficient risk exposure, it ultimately failed due to poor policy issuance and management practices, though the taxpayers avoided penalties by consulting their CPA.
