  "content": "Viewing insider transactions for NV Gold Corporation's (CVE:NVX ) over the last year, we see that insiders were net buyers. This means that a larger number of shares were purchased by insiders in relation to shares sold.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nNV Gold Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe President John Watson made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for CA$295k worth of shares at a price of CA$0.10 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of CA$0.15. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.\n\nJohn Watson bought 3.95m shares over the last 12 months at an average price of CA$0.13. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nSee our latest analysis for NV Gold\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. NV Gold insiders own about CA$1.5m worth of shares (which is 53% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About NV Gold Insiders?\n\nIt's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about NV Gold. One for the watchlist, at least! While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example, NV Gold has 5 warning signs (and 4 which are significant) we think you should know about.",
