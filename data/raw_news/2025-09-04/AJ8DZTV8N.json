  "title": "Russia And China Defying Trump:  Redefining A New World Order",
  "description": "Many thought Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office had ushered in a new round of serious negotiations about peace, however Russia and China are more determined than ever to bring about a new world order.",
  "content": "Many thought Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office had ushered in a new round of serious negotiations about peace in the ongoing 4 year-long conflict in Ukraine. However, the reality is that peace talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the US and Europe are clearly stalled, if at worse dead with many contentions from both sides surrounding security concerns and, importantly, trade sanctions. Putin is increasing his strikes and pressing for further military gains in defiance of Trumps deadlines to enter any serious peace talks. Moreover, at the September 3rd military parade in China marking 80 years since the country\u2019s victory over Japan in World War Two, the Putin and Xi standing side by side sent a clear message to President Trump: Your tariffs will not deter a new world order.\n\nThroughout the Russian Ukraine war, sanctions from Europe and the US have increasingly intensified on Russia and their trading partners. Secondary sanctions have even been enacted largely to prevent Russia from using intermediaries in other countries to fully continue its role in the global economy. According to multiple Treasury press releases the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) over the last year has intensified sanctions on over 400 individuals and entities over 17 different jurisdictions. This has forced Russia to lean heavily on China specifically in order to prop up its wartime economy and most importantly, continue trading its most important commodity crude oil. In fact, over the last five years, China has become Russia\u2019s biggest customer for crude oil, buying nearly half of the oil that Russia exports. Furthermore, bilateral trade between China and Russia surged to $244.8 billion in 2024, fueled by Western sanctions and wartime demand. On top of buying Russia\u2019s oil and energy commodities, China also supplies Russia with cars, semiconductors, and consumer goods. The two countries have also increasingly settled transactions in rubles and yuan with Putin announcing that 90% of the two countries transactions are being settled in those currencies as of December 2024, sidestepping Western financial systems. In fact, only 18% of Russian trade now uses the dollar or euro as of December, down from 87% and 67% of imports and exports, respectively in early 2022.\n\nChina has also supported Russia\u2019s war effort directly, with reports linking Chinese companies to shipments of gallium, germanium, and antimony\u2013key inputs for missile and drone production\u2013while banning their export to the US. A fundamental question many analysts have been questioning is whether Russia\u2019s wartime economic dependence on China is a tactical approach or symbolic of a more long-term strategic realignment?\n\nRussia is no stranger to Western pressure and intense economic sanctioning. The closest precedent to today\u2019s standoff was in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea. Western sanctions, similarly, targeted access to Western finance systems, energy exports, and defense industries. As a result, many Western banks, Exxon, BP, and other companies pulled out of or lessened operations in Russia. In response, Russia pivoted towards eastward to China again, signing the Power of Siberia Pipeline, and then accelerating the development of payment systems like and System for Transfer of Financial Messages to circumvent Western financial systems. This move from Russia laid the groundwork for its current geopolitical maneuvering in lieu of Western economic pressure.\n\nEven when put under lighter sanctions in 2018, during the Salisbury chemical attack, claims of election interference, and criminal cyber operations continued. Russia doubled down on de-dollarization policies through increasing gold reserves and diversifying trade settlement currencies. A practice going back to the Cold War, when Washington restricted technology exports through The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), the Soviets hunkered down and adapted by trading with neutral states and relying on the Eastern Bloc.\n\nThe lesson is clear: when squeezed, Russia has always sought workarounds, often outside Western systems. This suggests that Russia\u2019s relationship with China is not just out of necessity but a sign of further realignment that has been in the works for decades. Historical trade data supports this trend as China has surged past Germany and the US who were formerly very important trade partners. Yet history also shows when sanctions ease, Russia opportunistically re-engages with the West and Europe. After 2014 in the graph it shows that Russian imports in Germany sharply rebound coinciding with the annexation in Crimea ending. This highlights that Russia\u2019s current alignment with Beijing may remain during peace, but it is definitely not immutable.\n\nThe energy sector is perhaps the most important facet of Russia\u2019s realignment with Beijing. With the destruction of the Nordstream pipelines and Europe\u2019s pivot to alternate suppliers, the continent has locked in deals to reduce dependence on Russia. This shift is reinforced by Russia\u2019s push to expand its eastward infrastructure through the Power of Siberia pipelines cementing a more permanent divide in global energy markets.\n\nEurope\u2019s energy profile has already been undergoing large-scale restructuring: Russian energy imports have dropped sharply, and have been replaced partly by deals with the US, Norway, and Libya. Even after a post-war settlement Europe\u2019s new energy supply chain makes it unlikely that Russia will regain the dominance in Europe\u2019s energy supply. This also presents an opportunity for Europe to turn strongly towards renewables and develop more nuclear, wind, and water infrastructure in order to fully account for the gap which would further erode Russia\u2019s relevance in that market.\n\nWith Russia increasingly opening doors to become an oil supplier to Asia due to Western sanctions. This has been seen through China as Russia has become the biggest portion of its energy imports. This highlights an establishment of Cold War-esque trading blocs in energy markets where instead of a globalized interdependent market there is a rise of parallel energy spheres. This fragmentation further entrenches geopolitical tensions and makes LNG and energy pipelines strategic assets on top of commercial projects.\n\nAnother key implication lies in the de-dollarization trend driven by Russian alignment with China. As aforementioned, the two countries have increasingly settled trade in Yuan and Rubles and have been increasingly cut out of Western markets through tariffs and sanctions. In doing so, they are not only insulating themselves from Western financial pressure, but also developing the infrastructure to build parallel financial networks. This creates a new financial battleground in the Global South where Beijing and Moscow can promote non-dollar settlements in trade especially for discounted necessary energy resources and other more advanced manufacturing commodities. This undermines the dollar\u2019s dominance in the energy trade ecosystem and makes a multipolar financial world closer to a reality.\n\nSpecial thanks to Artem (Tom) Valyaev Kunisky, for his for his exceptional thought leadership, research, and editorial contributions to this article.",

      "text": "Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of sanctions by the coalition of countries supporting Ukraine\u2019s independence and territorial integrity, the economic relationship between Russia and China has evolved significantly. The partnership is characterized as symbiotic but highly asymmetrical, with China becoming an essential partner for Russia. China provides crucial markets for Russian exports, as well as access to critical inputs, while Russia, in turn, plays a secondary role. For China, Russia is a beneficial, yet non-essential partner, as it capitalizes on commercial ties without committing to a deep, full partnership. For China, Russia is an ideological ally to challenge US primacy and the current international order.\nBoth Russia and China are discontent with the current multilateral order (Gabuev, 2024), though with different motives. Russia has long been advocating for a multipolar world and increasingly isolationist policies, seeking to reduce its reliance on the West. In contrast, China, which has benefited significantly from the existing multilateral system, aims to claim a greater role on the global stage, rather than seeking to dismantle it entirely. China continues to engage actively in trade with the EU, the US and other global powers, while Russia\u2019s global presence has been significantly scaled down, particularly by sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nRussia\u2019s ability to sustain its war effort against Ukraine and challenge the international order depends largely on Chinese support, especially in evading sanctions and accessing critical technology. Without China\u2019s assistance, Russia would struggle to finance the war or secure the resources necessary for military operations (Bunzel & Ribakova, 2024). However, this dependence comes with risks. Although China does not formally endorse Western sanctions, it is cautious about transactions that might expose Chinese businesses to penalties or damage broader commercial interests, particularly its access to the EU and US markets.\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, bilateral trade between Russia and China has surged to record levels (Perry, 2025). Both nations benefit from their new \u201cno limits\u201d partnership (Joint Statement, 2022), though not equally so. For Russia, China has become an essential trading partner, overtaking Europe in importance, while for China, Russia remains a relatively unimportant market. In exchange for its energy and commodities (Hilgenstock et al., 2023),1 which are critical to Russia, but not indispensable for China, Russia receives Chinese consumer goods, cars and technological imports (Leahy et al., 2024).\nWhile trade flows are booming, investment from China to Russia remains modest. Chinese companies have opportunistically capitalized on the withdrawal of Western competitors from Russia. However, despite bold announcements of planned investments totaling US $200 billion (Skan, 2024), most cooperation projects, including large-scale ventures like the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, exist only on paper. While there has been some progress in areas of financial and payment system linkages, cooperation in these sectors, and even trade transactions, has been significantly hindered by the US\u2019s threat of secondary sanctions.\nWith Russia\u2019s ability to transact in dollars and euros severely restricted by sanctions, the Chinese yuan has steadily grown in prominence in the Russian economy. The combined share of currencies of countries \u201cunfriendly\u201d to Russia declined from 87% to 18% for exports and from 67% to 18% for imports between January 2022 and December 2024. Nearly 90% of the transactions are reportedly settled in yuan and rubles, as President Putin announced in December 2024. Nonetheless, the threat of US secondary sanctions on Chinese banks, as outlined in an executive order issued in December 2023, resulted in a slowdown in Russia-China trade in 2024. Exports from China to Russia decreased by approximately 1% in the first half of 2024, while Russian exports to China grew only modestly.\nThe Russia-China relationship, though strategically important, is fraught with tensions. Russia feels like a junior partner, frustrated by its shift from being a major exporter of high-value goods to China to primarily exporting energy and commodities. This dissatisfaction is compounded by China\u2019s reluctance to invest in Russia and its hesitancy to challenge Western sanctions. Russia is also concerned about the growing influence of the yuan. Meanwhile, China faces its own challenges in the relationship. Russia is a relatively small market for China, and China\u2019s diversified energy strategy reduces its reliance on Russian exports. Leading Chinese companies are cautious about risking global market access by deepening ties with Russia, especially given Western sanctions. China is also wary of Russia\u2019s growing ties with North Korea, which could complicate its regional strategy, and historical border issues between the two nations remain unresolved.\nSanctions are a crucial tool in economic statecraft but are not a guaranteed solution for geopolitical conflicts (Itskhoki & Ribakova, 2024). Their effectiveness depends on clear objectives, comprehensive enforcement and realistic goals. Sanctions are more impactful when applied decisively and comprehensively, as gradual implementation allows target countries to adapt. The sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014, particularly after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, highlight these complexities. While they caused significant costs, the continued energy exports and the gradual timing of sanctions, along with enforcement gaps, limited their effectiveness. Russia\u2019s economic size and global commodity market integration further diluted their impact, showing that larger, economically integrated nations can mitigate sanctions better than smaller ones.\nThe involvement of nations like China, but also Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, which helped Russia circumvent sanctions, underscores the difficulty of maintaining a unified sanctions regime. This reveals the trade-off between vague sanctions designed to signal intent and those with clear objectives and strict enforcement. In the context of an all-out conflict, sanctions with specific targets, firm enforcement and secondary sanctions on third-party nations are likely to be more effective. Ultimately, sanctions must be carefully tailored to achieve specific, attainable outcomes to maximize their impact.\nThe Russia-China relationship is symbiotic but asymmetrical \u2013 essential for Russia, but only a secondary concern for China, which takes advantage of Russia\u2019s vulnerabilities. While China currently acts as Russia\u2019s lifeline, after a potential settlement in Ukraine and the removal of sanctions, Russia may find itself deeply indebted to China, compelled to offer support in return.\n- 1 Russia\u2019s energy exports to China are just as necessary for Russia as they are for China, if not more so.\nReferences\nBunzel, T., & Ribakova, E.

      "text": "The latest US - EU trade deal sets lofty energy import goals, but logistical, legal, and market constraints raise doubts about feasibility.\nA freshly minted US \u2013 EU trade agreement, finalized over the weekend of July 26th, largely mimics the deal forged with Japan a week earlier, with some new requirements thrown in. The deal raises US import tariffs on EU goods excluding autos, steel and aluminium, to 15%, up from 10%. Notably, the import tariff on autos and auto parts was cut to 15%, down from 25 \u2013 27.5%. Tariffs on steel, and aluminium remain in place at 50%. Pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, aircraft components, and other critical materials remain outside tariff implementation. The EU has also committed to an additional $600bn in foreign direct investment into the United States, albeit the details around implementation remain unclear and are non-binding.\nAmericas trade deal with the EU establishes a framework for US trade negotiations we believe will persist moving ahead. The White House looks to be settling on a tariff rate, excluding certain sectors, at roughly 15%. In addition, the ability to get a final deal over the line will require non-binding commitments for new foreign direct investment. In our view, this dynamic creates clear inflationary pressure for America over the next 8 - 12 months.\nThe announced deal also outlines an aggressive EU commitment to purchase $750bn in US energy exports over three years, or $250bn annually. Kpler Insight views this purchase commitment as unrealistic under current market conditions. For context, total EU-27 purchases of US oil, LNG, LPG, and coal in 2024 was roughly $80.5bn, meaning the EU will find it hard to meet the $250bn goal, even when considering the possibility that Europe lifts the pace of imports from the US.\nBeyond the technical and commercial challenges, the EU cannot legally mandate domestic refiners to purchase oil or LNG from the US unless such a requirement is codified into law, which would likely face legal and market challenges under EU competition and procurement rules. Given that most European refiners are now privately owned and commercially driven, their purchasing decisions are guided primarily by economics, such as crude compatibility, freight costs, and refining margins rather than political pledges. Without financial incentives or regulatory mandates, a voluntary shift toward US supply would depend on clear commercial advantages.\nIn both value and volume terms, crude oil and refined products account for the bulk of US energy traded into the EU-27. So far this year, the bloc has imported around 1.6 Mbd of oil from the US, primarily crude (86%), along with diesel (8%) and lighter products. This marks a decline from 2024, when EU-27 imports reached nearly 1.9 Mbd, including 1.53 Mbd of crude, for an estimated annual value of $53 billion.\nSource: Kpler\nIn 2024, the US accounted for 13.4% of total EU-27 oil imports, and 11.4% year-to-date. This is already a significant share. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the EU has sharply reduced purchases of Russian crude and products, opening the door for the US to become its top oil supplier. On the other side of the trade, the EU-27 represented 28% of total US oil exports in 2024 and was by far the largest destination for US crude, receiving 1.53 Mbd, or 39% of total US crude exports.\nSource: Kpler; only selected origins are included\nIn theory, the US could more than triple its oil and product exports to the EU to meet the trade deal's ambitious value target, holding all other trade flows constant. However, this would require a near-total redirection of US oil flows toward Europe, at the expense of strategic ties with faster-growing emerging markets. Currently, over 1.3 Mbd of US crude is exported to Asia, with South Korea, India, Taiwan, and Thailand among the largest buyers. A potential US-China trade deal is also likely to include bilateral energy targets, necessitating increased flows to China. In Latin America, US refined products are vital, especially for Mexico, which sources 42% of its gasoline and more than half of its diesel from the US.\nAnother constraint lies in refining compatibility. Many European refiners, especially in the MED, are not designed to process large volumes of light sweet crude. Their configurations are optimised for medium sour grades from the Middle East, Russia, and fields like Johan Sverdrup in Norway. Increasing the share of light crude would reduce middle distillate yields and damage margins, particularly problematic while diesel cracks remain elevated. Additionally, long-term supply contracts with firms like Aramco and SOMO limit flexibility. European refiners cannot walk away from those volumes without triggering broader commercial risks.\nA more grounded objective would be for the EU to fully phase out the remaining Russian crude in its system. Imports of Urals to Hungary and Slovakia still average around 210 kbd, while refineries in Czechia (Litv\u00ednov, Kralupy) have already weaned off Russian barrels earlier this year. Eliminating these final links appears feasible.\nGiven its quality, incremental US crude would most likely displace imports from Libya, West Africa, or the North Sea. However, despite OPEC+ gradually increasing output, WTI remains cheaper than Murban in Asia on a delivered basis, while the narrowing of the Brent-Dubai EFS spread also supports Asian buying.\nSource: Argus Media\nIn the longer term, if 20% of current US crude flows to Asia were diverted to Europe, a realistic outcome, it could unlock an additional 250\u2013300 kbd, sufficient to fully replace the remaining Russian volumes. This is a much more achievable goal than a tripling of US oil flows to the EU and would add an additional $6.5bn in US \u2013 EU energy trade assuming a $65/bbl WTI price, or $7bn at a $70/bbl WTI price.\nBased on our European natural gas price forecast of $12.4/MMBtu for 2025 and $10.5/MMBtu for 2026, we estimate US LNG exports to Europe will likely finish in a range between $37\u201341 billion per year, assuming a 55\u201360% market share position. This implies that the value of LNG imports from the US would need to increase sixfold to meet the $250bn/year purchase target, holding all other trade flows constant. Even assuming all LNG came from the US, total import volumes would still need to more than triple to reach the mentioned target.\nSource: Kpler\nThere could be upside in 2026\u20132027, when the EU\u2019s plan to phase-out of Russian gas takes effect, but much of that upside is already factored in Kpler Insight\u2019s forecast, with a large share of US supply offsetting losses from Russian flows, alongside higher winter demand, and storage filled at capacity by the end of October 2026. With LNG prices expected to soften amid a global supply build-out, hitting $250 billion would require volumes to rise dramatically.\nSource: Kpler\nThe EU also imports volumes of US produced thermal and metallurgical coal, albeit in nominal USD terms this falls well short of nominal totals for LNG and oil purchases. In 2024, combined European imports of US thermal and metallurgical coal volumes amounted to $3.95bn. In our view, this total will likely decline 20 \u2013 30% over 2025 and 2026 due to weak coking coal prices. We do not foresee the EU growing it\u2019s purchases of US thermal or met coal given grade and contractual constraints.\nWhile not falling under the energy purchases commitment, the EU also purchases significant amounts of US soybeans. We expect EU arrivals from the US to rise 20% over 2025/2026, which would push nominal purchases values above $3bn this year, up from $2.8bn last year.\nKpler delivers unbiased, expert-driven intelligence that helps you stay ahead of supply, demand, and market shifts.\nTrade smarter.

      "text": "Sanctions target individuals and entities in 17 jurisdictions; Deputy Secretary calls on countries to take similar action against enablers of Russia\u2019s military-industrial base\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned 275 individuals and entities involved in supplying Russia with advanced technology and equipment that it desperately needs to support its war machine. Today\u2019s action targets both individual actors and sprawling sanctions evasion networks across 17 jurisdictions, including India, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Switzerland, Thailand, and T\u00fcrkiye. In addition to disrupting global evasion networks, this action also targets domestic Russian importers and producers of key inputs and other materiel for Russia\u2019s military-industrial base.\n\u201cThe United States and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,\u201d said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. \u201cAs evidenced by today\u2019s action, we are unyielding in our resolve to diminish and degrade Russia\u2019s ability to equip its war machine and stop those seeking to aid their efforts through circumvention or evasion of our sanctions and export controls.\u201d\nThe Department of State is also targeting sanctions evasion and circumvention in multiple third countries, including several PRC-based companies exporting dual-use goods that fill critical gaps in Russia\u2019s military-industrial base and entities and individuals in Belarus related to the Lukashenka regime\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s defense industry. State is also targeting several senior Russian Ministry of Defense officials and defense companies and those supporting Russia\u2019s future energy production and exports.\nSANCTIONS EVASION, CIRCUMVENTION, AND BACKFILL\nThanks to the unprecedented international sanctions regime implemented by the United States and its global partners, Russia is ever more reliant on complex and expensive transnational schemes to procure critical technological and manufacturing components and machinery it needs to create its own weapons production capability. This includes sensitive dual-use goods such as those cited in the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s multilateral Common High Priority List (CHPL), developed by the United States, European Union, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Today\u2019s action by Treasury disrupts a number of those schemes by designating more than 120 individuals and entities, including those involved in illicit procurement networks and the financial facilitators that support them. Financial facilitators such as trust and corporate formation service providers\u2014several of which were sanctioned today\u2014are key nodes in sanctions evasion ecosystems, and actions against them can act as force multipliers by rippling disruptive effects through multiple sanctions evasion networks simultaneously.\nMany of today\u2019s designations were enabled or informed with support from Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\nFor more information on these targets, please see Annex 1.\nRUSSIA\u2019S MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL BASE\nTreasury is also targeting more than 150 Russia-based defense and related materiel, technology, manufacturing, and aerospace companies that procure or produce finished military products or key components, precursors, and machinery that enable Russia to build or maintain the weaponry it uses against Ukraine.\nFor more information on these targets, please see Annex 2.\nANNEX 1: SANCTIONS EVASION, CIRCUMVENTION, AND BACKFILL\nRussian Defense Procurement Networks Operating in T\u00fcrkiye\nOFAC is targeting 14 entities and nine individuals, based primarily in T\u00fcrkiye, that have facilitated the procurement of advanced weapons, components, and ammunition on behalf of Russian end-users critical to bolstering Russia\u2019s military campaign, including the Russian Ministry of Defense and state-owned defense companies.

In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Non-U.S. persons are also prohibited from causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to wittingly or unwittingly violate U.S. sanctions, as well as from engaging in conduct that evades U.S. sanctions. OFAC\u2019s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines provide more information regarding OFAC\u2019s enforcement of U.S. sanctions, including the factors that OFAC generally considers when determining an appropriate response to an apparent violation.\nIn addition, foreign financial institutions that conduct or facilitate significant transactions or provide any service involving Russia\u2019s military-industrial base run the risk of being sanctioned by OFAC. For additional guidance, please see the updated OFAC advisory, \u201cUpdated Guidance for Foreign Financial Institutions on OFAC Sanctions Authorities Targeting Support to Russia\u2019s Military-Industrial Base,\u201d as well as OFAC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1146-1157.\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC\u2019s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\nAny persons included on the SDN List pursuant to E.O. 14024 may be subject to additional export restrictions administered by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).\nFor identifying information on the individuals and entities sanctioned today, click here.\n###"

  "argos_summary": "China\u2019s trade with Russia surged to $244.8\u202fbn in 2024, with China becoming Russia\u2019s biggest crude\u2011oil buyer and a key source of yuan\u2011denominated payments, which is likely to support the CNY against the USD. The U.S. sanctions have forced Russia to rely more on China, boosting yuan\u2011ruble trade flows and tightening the yuan\u2019s demand base. These developments could lift the CNY by 1\u20113\u202f% over the next 3\u20116\u202fmonths, while the USD may weaken modestly as sanctions pressure the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance in energy trade.",
