  "content": "A residential skyscraper has been approved for construction in the South Park neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles, though it\u2019s unclear how soon construction will begin.\n\nThe City Council last week signed off on a proposed 51-story apartment tower at 11th and Olive streets, a few blocks east of Crypto.com Arena and the L.A. Live entertainment district.\n\nNew York developer Mack Real Estate Development declined to talk about the planned tower, but documents filed with the city show a tall tower with 536 rental units and ground floor spaces for bars, restaurants and other retail uses. It would have parking for 581 vehicles both underground and above ground.\n\nThe site at 1105 S. Olive St. is now a surface parking lot.\n\nWhen asked when construction of the project might begin, a representative for Mack Real Estate said the company had no comment.\n\nEven though demand for housing is high in Los Angeles, it\u2019s challenging to construct ground-up multi-unit housing in the current financial climate, urban development consultant Hamid Behdad said.\n\nCosts have risen and grown more unpredictable on multiple fronts, Behdad said, raising uncertainty for developers about whether they will be able to rent or sell new units profitably after completing them.\n\nTop hurdles include high interest rates for borrowing money to finance construction. New tariffs are driving up the cost of imported construction materials while raising uncertainty about how long the tariffs may last or what new ones may arise.\n\nLabor costs have also been increasing in recent years, Behdad said, and the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have added a destabilizing effect on the construction labor pool.\n\nSome developers who have downtown projects approved but not built are trying to sell them to other developers or investors, he said.\n\nSouth Park, though, is one of downtown\u2019s most vibrant neighborhoods where thousands of new residences have been built in recent years, said Nick Griffin, executive director of the privately funded Downtown Center Business Improvement District, a nonprofit coalition of more than 2,000 property owners.\n\nThere is \u201ca demonstrable underlying demand for housing more across the city and region, but specifically in downtown with the occupancy rate at a pretty steady 90% or so,\u201d he said.\n\nThe location of Mack Real Estate\u2019s planned project has already proved desirable to developers, Griffin said.\n\n\u201cThere have already been several significant projects built along that stretch and there are another four large-scale projects within a couple of blocks, so you\u2019re you\u2019re talking about a significant residential hub\u201d that stands to attract new residents and more development, he said.\n\nGriffin said he hopes developers like Mack Real Estate are getting their projects ready for market conditions to change in the next six months to two years.\n\n\u201cFinancial conditions are going to align themselves at some point in the not too distant future,\u201d he said, \u201cand they want to have their projects teed up and ready to go.\u201d",

      "text": "Residential skyscraper for downtown L.A. mall clears hurdle to city approval\n- Share via\nA planned new residential skyscraper for downtown Los Angeles has cleared a key regulatory hurdle to be built in an unusual location \u2014 on top of an existing parking garage.\nThe proposed tower would be one of the city\u2019s tallest at 53 stories, rising in the center of one the city\u2019s densest mixed-use complexes called the Bloc that already has office and hotel towers as well an Alamo Drafthouse cineplex, stores and restaurants.\nLos Angeles developer Ratkovich Co. has sold its interest in the Bloc office, hotel and shopping complex in downtown Los Angeles to one of its financial partners, National Real Estate Advisors.\nCity Planning Commission members last week approved the long-planned addition, which will head to the City Council for a final vote on the proposed 41-story apartment or condominium tower that would be built atop the complex\u2019s original 12-story garage.\nThe Bloc is a downtown stalwart dating to the early 1970s, when it opened as an indoor shopping mall that filled an entire downtown block and also boasted a plush hotel and a high-rise office building. For years, tourists flocked to the premier address at 7th and Flower Streets.\nBy 2013 when it was sold, then-Macy\u2019s Plaza was a dated, downscale relic that got little love, even though its location near prominent office skyscrapers, hotels and a subway interchange remained one of the city\u2019s busiest.\nLos Angeles developer Wayne Ratkovich embarked on an ambitious makeover that included removing the roof of the mall and cutting out much of the main floor to create a sunken, sunlight-filled public plaza.\nMore entrances to the complex were created, including an underground portal to the 7th Street/Metro Center light-rail station.\nBut unexpected construction issues slowed work and helped drive costs well over the original $180-million budget to more than $250 million. Ratkovich Co. sold its interest in the property in 2018 to one of its financial partners, National Real Estate Advisors, which is moving ahead with the planned residential tower.\nNational Real Estate Advisors didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the planned addition, but public documents before the City Planning Commission show it would include 466 units consisting of 83 studios, 271 one-bedroom units, 100 two-bedroom units and 12 three-bedroom units.\nThe $45-million renovation of the Sheraton Los Angeles Downtown Hotel now underway will include upgrading all the rooms and suites as well as the hotel lobby, according to details unveiled Wednesday by local developer Ratkovich Co.\nThe tower would only occupy a portion of the area of the garage roof, leaving room for an outdoor amenity deck with a swimming pool, barbecue area and landscaping including a lawn, shrubs and trees. There would also be indoor-outdoor landscaped recreational space on the top level, plans show.\nThe garage would be seismically retrofitted as part of the development the developer hopes to begin by 2027 and complete by 2030. The timing and decision to make the units apartments or condos will depend on market demand, the developers have said.\nPlans approved by the commissioners would also allow the owners to erect large-format digital displays at multiple levels around the complex that is surrounded by 7th, 8th, Hope and Flower Streets.\nLos Angeles is grappling with both a housing shortage and a slowdown in new construction, real estate data provider CoStar said.\nThe number of multifamily units under construction has declined 22% year over year, pushing the city\u2019s multifamily vacancy rate down to 5%, with tenants renting 10,000 more units than they vacated over the past year.\nThe Macy\u2019s store at the Bloc closed recently, one of 66 Macy\u2019s stores that were identified as underproductive by management in January.\nSome downtown stakeholders including office landlord Rising Realty Partners offered letters of support for the Bloc residential project.\n\u201cThe addition of a multi-family residential use would transform the existing development into a true mixed-use project that includes residential, commercial and hotel uses,\u201d Rising Realty Partners said. \u201cThe project would aid in creating a balanced 24-hour community.\u201d"

      "text": "With a surging residency rate, this neighborhood is transforming L.A.\n- Share via\n- Despite myriad challenges, downtown L.A. is staging a comeback by attracting a steady stream of new residents.\n- Downtown L.A. remains a vibrant and growing residential neighborhood with a population of 90,000 \u2014 about the size of Santa Monica.\n- Occupancy in downtown apartments has remained about 90% for more than a year, slightly higher than the level before the pandemic.\nLike many downtown Los Angeles residents, Ricardo Sebasti\u00e1n doesn\u2019t own a car and prefers it that way.\n\u201cI do not want the responsibility of owning a vehicle. That\u2019s not for me,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n, who grew up in Chicago relying on public transit.\nThe 38-year-old consultant travels around L.A. by train and bus, but finds most of what they need close to home in the South Park district near Crypto.com Arena, including leisurely strolls.\n\u201cI enjoy going for long walks from one end of downtown to the other,\u201d Sebasti\u00e1n said in Muffin Can Stop Us, a casual coffee bar and restaurant at the base of a high-rise apartment complex on Hope Street. \u201cI love living downtown.\u201d\nSebasti\u00e1n is hardly alone in that sentiment. In addition to being a commercial center with office skyscrapers, trendy hotels and cultural venues, downtown L.A. remains a vibrant and growing residential neighborhood with a population of 90,000 \u2014 about the size of Santa Monica.\nDespite myriad challenges \u2014 including a sprawling homeless population and its reputation as a sometimes dodgy place to live and work \u2014 downtown L.A. is staging a comeback by attracting a steady stream of new residents.\nOccupancy in downtown apartments has remained about 90% for more than a year, recent surveys by a downtown business support group show. That is slightly higher than the level before the pandemic, when offices hummed with 9-to-5ers.\nIn fact, the downtown population has more than tripled since 2000, reflecting a dynamic shift in the city center\u2019s character toward a 24-hour lifestyle.\n\u201cYou do not see that kind of change in any other neighborhood in Los Angeles,\u201d downtown activist Cassy Horton said. \u201cIf anything, most neighborhoods are kind of aging and atrophying versus adding people.\u201d\nThe reasons that people choose to live in L.A.\u2019s urban core are varied. Some point to the value of living downtown, where rents for high-end buildings are relatively more affordable than in other parts of the city.\nA raft of new developments has increased the availability of housing units. And with thousands of houses and apartments lost to wildfires in an already tight housing market, there is now widespread demand for housing that landlords hope to attract downtown.\nThere\u2019s also the convenience factor.\nMany residents say they are drawn to downtown\u2019s urban lifestyle with stores, restaurants and cultural attractions such as the Broad or Walt Disney Concert Hall within walking distance. And unlike dwellers of most parts of L.A., they want their blocks to get busier, Horton said.\nOregon wildfires leave California transplants homeless and facing rising housing costs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only neighborhood where residents actually want more neighbors,\u201d she said.\nOne of the many frustrations over this month\u2019s outbreak of violence around federal immigration sweeps was the way social media coverage was \u201ccompletely devoid of any reference to the fact that people live here,\u201d Horton said. \u201cDowntown gets treated in these situations really differently than other residential neighborhoods would be.\u201d\nThe addition of residents has helped offset downtown\u2019s other dramatic population shift: the unsettling disappearance of thousands of office workers who did their jobs from home during the pandemic shutdowns and are unlikely to ever return at pre-COVID-19 levels. Many firms have implemented hybrid schedules that allow employees to work at home certain days of the week.\nWedbush Securities is moving from a downtown L.A. tower to Pasadena, where it will occupy smaller offices suitable for employees with hybrid schedules.\nSome other white-collar companies have given up on downtown and moved their offices to other urbanized neighborhoods, including Century City and Pasadena, saying that downtown hasn\u2019t sufficiently recovered from the pandemic emergency as stores and restaurants remain closed and streets feel less safe than they did in 2019.\nNevertheless, \u201cthe downtown community has maintained a sort of passionate commitment to the place, and while there are challenges, they are not dissuaded by them,\u201d said Nick Griffin, executive vice president of the DTLA Alliance.\nCommitted residents say that they like downtown\u2019s city lifestyle and that they want to see it improve as the neighborhood transitions from being primarily office-centric to more residential-oriented. Restaurants and other small businesses are making a comeback after COVID-19 restrictions contributed to widespread closures, Griffin said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had 140 new restaurants open since the end of the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s many, many more than we lost.\u201d\nSupport for the businesses is underpinned by the residential population and growth in visits to downtown by regional residents and tourists, Griffin said.\n\u201cWhere it was a doom loop in one direction three years ago, downtown is now going back to that virtuous cycle that we were in after the financial crisis\u201d that caused the Great Recession nearly two decades ago. In the years before the pandemic, \u201cwe were just on a roll,\u201d Griffin said.\nThat included a monumental housing construction boom prompted by the fact that developers find it somewhat easier to get big projects approved downtown than elsewhere because city leaders have long identified downtown as a place for dense housing growth. It has ample sites to build on, especially in South Park, and is the nexus for the region\u2019s rail, bus and freeway lines.\nSouthern California has a serious housing shortage, and \u201cdowntown is one of the few places that has been able to build at any scale over the past 10 years,\u201d Griffin said. In that time, 22% of the new housing in the city has been built downtown, he said.\nThe latest major project is a 54-story skyscraper with 685 apartments nearly completed at Hill Street and Olympic Boulevard, a few blocks east of the L.A. Live entertainment complex. The tower, called Olympic + Hill, is being built by Canadian developer Onni Group, which has been one of downtown\u2019s most active builders during the housing boom.\nOther large projects planned downtown include three similar-scaled high-rises near Olympic + Hill by other developers, but they\u2019re not under construction and the pipeline is drying up.\nHousing construction in Los Angeles plunged during the first quarter of 2025, according to a report by research firm Hilgard Analytics, a drop-off that could ultimately worsen the city\u2019s affordability crisis.\nThe city approved permits for 1,325 new residences during the first three months of 2025, down nearly 57% from the same period last year.\n\u201cSupply is going to be falling off a cliff in 2026,\u201d said local developer Jaime Lee, chief executive of the Jamison group of companies.\nIndustry observers point to high interest rates and the rising costs of material and labor, as well as uncertainty over tariffs and immigration policies that could reduce the construction workforce.\nAdditionally, local developers are wary of Measure ULA, a new Los Angeles tax on large property sales that cuts into potential profits.\nAn urban lifestyle that doesn\u2019t rely on driving everywhere helped lure Noemi Tagorda downtown in 2006.\nShe moved from Cambridge, Mass., after getting a job at USC, where she manages the financial aid office.\nShe and her husband didn\u2019t have cars in Massachusetts, \u201cand I realized I never wanted to drive again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe found a place here in downtown where I could commute to work taking the bus or the train.\u201d\nBunker Hill is primed to elevate its status as the region\u2019s leading arts center even as the area around it struggles with persistent homelessness and post-pandemic losses of office tenants.\nThey\u2019re now a one-car family with three sons, Tagorda said. The boys attend Catholic schools downtown, including Cathedral High School near Dodger Stadium, which her oldest reaches by bus. They\u2019re active in a Boy Scout troop that meets at a Buddhist temple in Little Tokyo.\n\u201cI think that a lot of the families leave because there is a perception that there are no educational opportunities in downtown,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need everyone to see downtown as a vibrant community with families and all types of people there, and we also need to support the schools that are in our community.\u201d\nShe shops for groceries at downtown\u2019s Ralphs and Whole Foods stores, and laments the closure of the Macy\u2019s department store on 7th Street this year. \u201cI used to go to Macy\u2019s a lot.\u201d\nAlso in walking distance are movie theaters Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and Regal LA Live, and an indoor golf simulator that the boys enjoy.\nTagorda\u2019s mother, a migrant from Mexico, lived downtown in an apartment building that was razed to make way for the Los Angeles Convention Center that opened its first phase in 1971.\n\u201cThere have been families here for a very, very long time,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies do belong downtown.\u201d\nThe population base is large enough now for downtown to be considered a true residential neighborhood with the same needs as other parts of the city, said Horton, who is a co-founder of the Downtown Los Angeles Residents Assn.\nAmong its devotees are residents who work in government or are architects or urban planners who \u201cknow downtown is a real project,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want something that\u2019s kind of cast in amber and already formed, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to kind of help shape the neighborhood.\u201d"

      "text": "Olympics broadcast center and movie studio coming to Hollywood Park\n- Share via\nRams owner Stan Kroenke will build a movie studio next to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood that will serve as the international broadcast center for the 2028 Olympic Games.\nConstruction will start by summer on the studio and production facility that will house hundreds of broadcasters from around the world that have acquired rights to cover the Summer Games in Los Angeles, Kroenke\u2019s company said Tuesday.\nAfter the Games, the facility known as Hollywood Park Studios will be used to make movies, television shows and other productions and perhaps host live broadcasts.\nThe development is part of Hollywood Park, a multibillion-dollar complex built on the site of a former horse racing track also known as Hollywood Park that includes the stadium, apartments, theaters, offices, shops and restaurants.\nA luxury hotel is under construction there, and more development including a grocery store and medical offices is being considered.\nKroenke\u2019s organization hopes that attention from the Olympics will boost Hollywood Park Studios\u2019 appeal as a future entertainment production center.\n\u201cWe want it to be recognized around the world,\u201d said Alan Bornstein, who is overseeing development of the studio for Kroenke.\nConstruction is underway on a $300 million hotel next to SoFi Stadium, the latest addition to Rams owner Stan Kroenke\u2019s sprawling mixed-use development in Inglewood.\nThe studio is part of Hollywood Park\u2019s master development plan focusing on media, entertainment and technology, Bornstein said, anchored by SoFi Stadium, YouTube Theater and the NFL Media office building.\n\u201cThere has been an increasing convergence of media and technology and sports, all under the notion of entertainment that is now distributed in in multiple channels,\u201d Bornstein said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s through streaming or whether through broadcast television or movies in theaters,\u201d\nThe first phase of Hollywood Park Studios will occupy 12 acres and will consist of five soundstages, each 18,000 square feet, two of which may be opened to a single 36,000-square-foot stage.\nThe complex will have a three-story, 80,000-square-foot office building to support stage, production and postproduction activities. The studios will have a dedicated open base camp where trucks, equipment and actors\u2019 trailers could be placed, along with a parking structure for 1,100 cars. Future development could include as many as 20 stages and 200,000 square feet of related office space.\nThe additional stages would be built to suit for future tenants as demand emerges, Bornstein said, who declined to estimate how much the studio complex will cost.\nAlthough demand for soundstages outstripped supply a few years ago, production has recently slowed and dampened the current need for them.\nLast year, the average annual occupancy rate dropped to 63%, a further indication of Hollywood\u2019s sustained production slowdown, according to a recent report by FilmLA, a nonprofit organization that tracks on-location shoot days in the Greater Los Angeles area.\nThat was a decline from 2023, which saw an average regional occupancy rate of 69%. That was the year when dual strikes by writers and actors crippled the local production economy for months.\nThe foray into Hollywood-level production facilities is part of Kroenke\u2019s goal to combine sports, entertainment and media from around the world, Bornstein said.\nIn addition to the Rams, Kroenke is owner of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, the Colorado Avalanche hockey team, the Colorado Rapids soccer team, the Colorado Mammoth lacrosse team and Arsenal Football Club, the Premier League soccer team based in London.\nSoFi Stadium, where the Chargers also play football, will be converted into the largest Olympic swimming venue in history during the Games in 2028. It will host the Olympic opening ceremony with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, as well as the opening ceremony for the Paralympic Games.\nKroenke is also a major real estate developer and landlord. The 300-acre Hollywood Park project is one of the largest mixed-use developments under construction in the western United States. SoFi Stadium alone cost $5 billion to build.\nRams owner Stan Kroenke is spearheading a development project in Woodland Hills that will include the team\u2019s new headquarters and could cost more than $10 billion.\nLast month, he also unveiled plans for a new Rams headquarters on a 100-acre site at Warner Center in Woodland Hills that would include a residential and retail community intended to be the centerpiece of the San Fernando Valley. It could cost more than the total price of Hollywood Park, which has been valued by outside observers at more than $10 billion.\nCreating a second epicenter in Woodland Hills allows the Rams to significantly increase the size of their footprint in the Southern California market.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking to do a practice facility, you don\u2019t need to be right in the middle of everything, and typically that real estate is very expensive,\u201d Kroenke told The Times. \u201cWe built an identity in the Valley, with Cal Lutheran, and a lot of our players and families are up there. Our experience was really good.\u201d\nArchitecture firm Gensler spearheaded the design for the Warner Center headquarters and Hollywood Park Studios. Clayco will be the general contractor for the studio, with Pacific Edge Projects acting as project manager. Financing was arranged by Guggenheim Investments.\nTimes staff writer Sam Farmer contributed to this report."

      "text": "\u2018It\u2019s scaring the crap out of me\u2019: How Trump\u2019s tariffs are colliding with rebuilding fire ravaged L.A.\n- Share via\nUncertainty about which imports will be socked with new tariffs and when they\u2019ll go into effect has thrown a cloud over home builders and other real estate developers trying to pay for new construction throughout Southern California, including neighborhoods scorched by the January wildfires.\nMany builders are trying to budget for rising costs but are frustrated because they don\u2019t know what construction materials and appliances, such as stoves and air conditioners, will cost in the months ahead.\nQuestions surrounding the tariffs are already forcing contractors to make quick purchasing decisions, especially for windows, doors, plumbing and lighting fixtures and other materials made or manufactured in China, which are subject to duties of 145%. Prices for their customers are already going up.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s plans to slap new tariffs on imports from Canada and other countries could set off new waves of inflation in home building.\n\u201cWe\u2019re padding a 5% to 10% contingency for what we\u2019re calling \u2018market volatility\u2019 into the budget,\u201d said Cory Singer, a general contractor working on 10 rebuild projects in Pacific Palisades, including the first home under construction there since fire tore through the neighborhood.\nHe said a tile supplier told him last week that if he didn\u2019t place an order immediately the new price would be 10% higher, and Singer is telling rebuilding homeowners to prepare for higher costs.\nThe wildfires \u2014 which burned an estimated 16,000 homes, businesses and other structures \u2014 will ignite a massive construction boom around Los Angeles.\nBut builders were already bracing for material shortages and potentially higher costs for such items as lumber and bathtubs.\nSinger said some of his clients are considering putting containers on their properties so they can buy materials over the next few weeks and store them until they\u2019re needed.\nArchitects, developers and contractors working in fire-affected areas said the most worrying part of the tariff debate is not knowing which levies will remain as they take on one of the largest rebuilding projects in L.A. history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s scaring the crap out of me,\u201d said Bryan Wong, chief executive of San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity. Wong\u2019s nonprofit recently received the first permit to rebuild in Altadena and is in conversations with an additional two dozen low-income property owners looking for assistance.\nFrequent changes in Trump administration policy and retaliatory responses from other countries mean the effects of the tariffs are hard to predict, he said.\nBusiness owners across Los Angeles who rely on imported goods are bracing for higher prices as Trump imposes steep taxes on products from several countries.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single person out there alive who thinks we\u2019re done with this conversation,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThis list is going to grow and is going to change.\u201d\nFrustration in the real estate industry is widespread, said Anirban Basu, chief economist for Associated Builders and Contractors, a national trade group.\n\u201cComing into this year, the outlook was quite positive,\u201d he said, with lower mortgage rates, growing inventory of homes for sale and a stabilizing office leasing market as many employers tightened their work-from-home policies. Strong consumer spending suggested construction of more shopping centers was likely.\nTrump\u2019s election had also raised expectations of an upward economy, he said, adding: \u201cOn Jan. 20 during inauguration, American business was in high spirits.\u201d\nSince then, some prices have fallen, significantly including the price of oil, but as the global economic picture has weakened in recent months, \u201cthe construction outlook today is not nearly as sanguine as it was seven or eight weeks ago,\u201d Basu said.\nThe fires will have a deep and lasting impact on construction, entertainment, retail and other sectors of the Los Angeles economy while creating a construction boom.\nTariff impacts are at the heart of construction industry concerns, but the Trump administration\u2019s immigration and deportation policies are also worrying to employers who have struggled to find labor in recent years, he said.\n\u201cConstruction makes outsized use of foreign-born workers,\u201d Basu said, and \u201csometimes the data aren\u2019t clear about whether these foreign-born workers are documented or undocumented.\u201d\nThe construction labor force has already been shrinking for various reasons, he said, and now \u201cmany of these would-be workers are scared by these high-profile deportations.\u201d\nThe impacts of the Trump administration tariffs are still \u201crelatively muted\u201d on the operations of industrial real estate developer and operator Dedeaux Properties, but they\u2019re helping put tenants and potential tenants on edge, said Alon Kraft, chief operating officer of the Santa Monica company.\n\u201cThe way these tariffs have been rolled out has really created a lot of uncertainty and that really makes it a challenge to plan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a pause in a lot of major decision-making until there\u2019s at least some sense of where things might be headed\u201d in terms of tariff costs and how they will impact their business.\nBusinesses that use industrial buildings for shipping, receiving and manufacturing are going to take more time to decide whether to lease more space or expand the size of their operations. Investors will be more cautious about buying buildings if the future of the economy remains uncertain.\nDemand for warehouses used to move goods through Los Angeles County ports is expected to fall if widespread tariffs take effect, potentially damaging the economic vitality of one of the world\u2019s largest industrial real estate markets.\nLast week, Trump authorized a 90-day pause for more than 75 countries facing tariff hikes, including Mexico but excluding China.\n\u201cIt still just pushes off the uncertainty for 90 days,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen on the back side? We don\u2019t know which countries will come to the table and which won\u2019t.\u201d\nThere are potential tenants in the marketplace looking for space to rent, he said, but they\u2019re taking longer to make decisions about whether to make a move.\n\u201cReal estate doesn\u2019t react at the speed of the stock market,\u201d Kraft said, as investors and landlords pause to see how the tariffs will play out. \u201cFingers crossed it\u2019s not as bad as we fear.\u201d\nAccording to the National Assn. of Home Builders, scarcity and an acute, sustained rise in building material costs \u2014 for items as diverse as softwood lumber and electricity distribution transformers \u2014 are driving up the cost to construct homes and harming housing affordability. Tariffs stand to aggravate the situation.\nNAHB estimates that $204 billion worth of goods were used in the construction of both new multifamily and single-family housing in 2024. About $14 billion of those goods were imported, the trade group said, meaning about 7% of all goods used in new residential construction originate from a foreign nation.\nTariffs mean importers must pay additional costs for importing items from other countries. Price increases are typically absorbed by the importer or passed on to the end consumer of the good, usually in some combination.\nFor example, if a retailer imports a $500 washing machine from a country subject to a 25% tariff, the retailer will owe $125 in tariffs to the U.S. government, the trade group said.\nFor most goods, the costs are passed on to consumers, NAHB said, \u201cso tariffs on building materials raise the cost of housing, and consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices.\u201d\nSinger, the contractor, and others said current price hikes do not threaten the viability of rebuilding Los Angeles County homes damaged by the wildfires. To varying degrees, they said, different issues \u2014 such as local government permitting, restricted access to sites in the Palisades and the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies affecting availability of labor \u2014 rated as greater concerns than tariffs.\nAndrew Slocum, who is working on 14 home rebuilds in the Eaton fire area, said builders were used to uncertainty from supply chain problems that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing so much pain right now,\u201d said Slocum, chief executive of Green Development Co. of Pasadena. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about what could happen.\u201d"

In 1781, 44 settlers from modern Mexico established a permanent settlement, naming the new community El Pueblo de la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles. Some 200 years later, this historic neighborhood is thriving with economic vitality.\nMany of the original 19th and early 20th century buildings now serve as housing for 88,000 current residents and local, independent businesses dot every street corner. Combined with the incredible walkability of the neighborhood, a true sense of community has flourished and created a small-town community within a big city environment. Despite only constituting 1.4% of the city\u2019s land area, DTLA\u2019s businesses generate a staggering 40% of the city\u2019s sales taxes. Additionally, DTLA accounts for 19% of citywide employment at a density almost 14 times greater than the citywide average of jobs per square mile.\nSimply put, there is nowhere else like Downtown LA in Los Angeles. Visitors, residents and prospective residents can all spend all day exploring without ever having to leave the neighborhood - which means less time in LA traffic and more time in the LA sun. There\u2019s truly something for everyone with restaurants, events, sights, live performances, and a true small-town community. Downtown LA is an epicenter of activity with over 100 new restaurant and bar openings over the past couple of years and an average of 8 \u2013 10 million visitors per month. Plus, with the expansion and upgrade of Metro services with the addition of three brand new stations in DTLA, it\u2019s easier than ever to come check out the neighborhood.\nDowntown Los Angeles offers a diverse array of activities for visitors no matter what your interests are.

      "text": "- Share via\nOver the last century, L.A.\u2019s love affair with the single-family home has created a suburban sprawl of epic proportions.\nThree bedrooms. A white-picket fence. A square of grass for the barbecue.\nBut for many, the dream of home ownership will never be realized. Home prices have soared, wages haven\u2019t kept pace, and more than half of L.A. residents rent their home. What\u2019s more, the fires in Altadena and Pacific Palisades earlier this year destroyed thousands of homes, sending droves of homeowners scrambling back into the rental market.\nLos Angeles knows how to weather a crisis \u2014 or two or three. Angelenos are tapping into that resilience, striving to build a city for everyone.\nThe Los Angeles City Council has given final approval to a sweeping rezoning plan to meet state-mandated housing goals, clearing the path for an additional 255,000 homes to be built. But single-family zones will be left largely untouched; the new housing will be developed along commercial corridors and existing dense residential neighborhoods. In the meantime, some municipalities are fighting the state\u2019s housing mandates.\nMarket fluctuations and legislative uncertainty make predictions challenging. But some observers believe that by 2050, the fate of L.A.\u2019s housing stock will be decided by one of two competing ideologies:\nOne of them is associated with many corporate landlords and investment firms, which buy up increasing shares of homes and rent them out to tenants. If they prevail, it\u2019s likely that 2050 will look the same as it does now, only the chasm between the rich and the poor will grow. Home prices will keep rising, as will L.A.\u2019s percentage of renters, according to Tiena Johnson Hall, general manager of the L.A. Housing Department.\nThe other view comes from a coalition of policymakers, nonprofits and aspiring homeowners who are hoping for a future where L.A.\u2019s homes are within reach of its working class, and properties are owned by the people who live in them.\nTheir shared vision looks like this: Denser neighborhoods. Smaller homes, some modular or 3-D-printed. Properties co-owned by friend groups instead of just families. ADUs in backyards across the city, many of them separated from their original properties and bought and sold as separate homes.\nWith a key vote coming on a bid to rezone Los Angeles to add 250,000 more homes, city officials released a long-awaited report on the history of exclusionary zoning.\nL.A. County Assessor Jeff Prang, who points out that people commute to L.A. from Santa Clarita, Palmdale, Lancaster and Riverside, believes people will start moving closer to the city.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to live 40 miles away from L.A. and slog through two hours of traffic every day. It affects their quality of life,\u201d Prang said. \u201cThe answer is to increase density, upzone areas and allow multifamily housing.\u201d\nBut he doesn\u2019t see the battle between the state and local governments (and HOAs that hope to keep things the way they are) ending any time soon.\nSacramento has a few tools at its disposal, including what is colloquially known as builder\u2019s remedy, a penalty for cities that don\u2019t adequately plan for California\u2019s inevitable population increase. California cities are required to produce a housing plan every eight years that brings zoning for additional housing. If they fall far enough behind on that plan, developers in those cities can essentially ignore local zoning restrictions and build whatever they want, as long as the project includes a handful of affordable housing units.\nA handful of cities have fallen behind on their plans, and developers capitalized, getting the green light for high-density projects that wouldn\u2019t be approved otherwise.\nCurrently, housing element laws only require cities to plan and zone for additional housing. But Prang said by 2050, the state could go further, forcing cities to permit and encourage housing construction and punishing those that don\u2019t.\nThe most important tool for shaping the future of L.A. housing may very well be Senate Bill 9, which makes it easier for California homeowners and developers to add density by splitting single-family lots in half and building duplexes, townhouses and ADUs.\nThanks to a handful of bills that make ADUs easier and faster to build, Prang said ADU applications have skyrocketed since the law passed in 2021, and his office spends around 40% of its time processing them. Many applications this year have come from fire victims looking to build ADUs quickly to live in while they rebuild their homes.\nToday, building takes time. There are a dozen governmental agencies involved, and projects get mired in red tape. But Prang said by 2050, he expects there to be a single portal that consolidates all the applications and checkpoints required, so new developments can be green-lit in weeks or months, not years.\nL.A.\u2019s tax on the sale of multimillion-dollar properties has collected about $480 million. It will be spent on affordable housing and tenant protection efforts.\nL.A., where 72% of residential land is zoned for single-family use, is also looking to Measure ULA to help mitigate its housing woes. The measure, which took affect in 2023 and brings a transfer tax to property sales above $5 million, has already raised more than $660 million for housing and homelessness initiatives.\nIt\u2019s a polarizing policy. A recent analysis from UCLA\u2019s Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies \u2014 titled \u201cThe Unintended Consequences of Measure ULA\u201d \u2014 suggests the tax has chilled a once-robust market in L.A., while sales above $5 million have remained steady in other markets across L.A. County not affected by the tax. But by 2050, Measure ULA will likely have raised tens of billions of dollars \u2014 an unprecedented amount of cash that, if used effectively, has the potential to solve many of the cities housing woes.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use those funds to bring housing to market faster and look at creative models for home-ownership \u2014 things we haven\u2019t been able to do for lack of funding,\u201d said Johnson Hall, whose Housing Department oversees Measure ULA.\n\u201cOther cities are grabbing our youth. Seattle and Denver offer more affordable homes with walkable amenities,\u201d Johnson Hall said. \u201cOur economy is dependent on giving those 20- to 30-somethings a reason to stay here.\u201d\nReal estate agent Christopher Stanley is all too familiar with L.A.\u2019s grueling application process for building, rebuilding, or even remodeling. He specializes in tenancy-in-common properties, a form of possession where residents share ownership of a property.\nThe TIC model often comes in the form of developers replacing single-family homes with townhouses, splitting one house into two. Stanley said there\u2019s plenty of demand for it, since the price-per-square-foot typically runs about 25% less than single-family properties, but the lengthy permitting process makes it unattractive for many developers.\nBy 2050, Stanley said AI could make the permitting process so quick and painless that not only house-flippers and developers, but also individual homeowners, could add density to their neighborhoods. Single-family homes become duplexes. Empty backyards become lots for ADUs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the easiest way to get affordable housing stock onto the market,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cBut changing the laws will be crucial.\u201d\nFor Stanley, the biggest boost would come if more cities allow ADUs to be sold as separate properties, not just rented \u2014 a trend that has already caught on up the coast in Oregon and Washington. California\u2019s Assembly Bill 1033 allows such sales, but cities have to opt-in. San Jose was the first in 2024, and a few Bay Area cities followed. But Southern California, a region that has grown accustomed to the single-family lifestyle, hasn\u2019t been as eager to adopt the idea.\n\u201cIf we want more people owning their homes instead of renting, we have to make ADUs something you can buy,\u201d he said.\nIn 2016, Stanley said, he sold a 900-square-foot tiny house in Boyle Heights to a 31-year-old for $375,000. The buyer used it as a way into the market, and three years later, they sold it for $515,000 and upgraded to a bigger mid-century home in Mount Washington. He said if prices and wages continue the way they\u2019re going, ADUs and tiny homes will be the easiest way into the market for young people.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a jumping off point. It\u2019s the quickest way to stop paying your landlord\u2019s mortgage and start paying your own,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be happening a lot more by 2050.\u201d\nHomes won\u2019t be the only things changing in 25 years. The people filling them will, too.\nThe 20th century saw the rise of the nuclear family, and most homes were bought and occupied by parents and their children. But these days, young people are waiting to get married \u2014 if they\u2019re getting married at all \u2014 and not having as many children.\nCombine that with their inability to afford a home in the first place, and we\u2019ll soon see the rise of co-buying: Groups of friends going in on a Silver Lake bungalow. Two families splitting an Eagle Rock Craftsman. Parents purchasing a Mid-City property along with their adult children.\nMatt Holmes is the chief executive of CoBuy, a company that helps groups of people co-buy homes and collectively manage the property. He said California is its biggest market due to the price of homes outpacing wages across the state.\nThe company\u2019s data don\u2019t go back that far, but in 2023, a CoBuy survey found that roughly 27% of U.S. home sales were bought by co-buyers \u2014 groups beyond married couples. The same year, data from the National Assn. of Realtors showed that co-buyers made up a bit less of the market for first-time homebuyers at roughly 19%. Either way, it\u2019s a big hike from a few decades ago, when the trend was virtually nonexistent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an expedited path to home ownership, and it helps people gain access to a broader swath of housing stock beyond just starter homes,\u201d he said.\nHolmes co-founded the company with his mother a decade ago. Over the last year and a half, he said, friend groups have taken over family groups as his biggest clients.\nIf neighborhoods get denser, homes get smaller, and shared homes become more common, one factor often associated with single-family homes will be up in the air. What happens when all you can afford is a cramped 500-square-foot ADU? Or the grassy backyard where your dog used to run around is replaced by a two-story townhouse?\nAngelenos will probably spend more time outside the house in 2050. As a result, parks and communal spaces will become not just a want, but a need.\n\u201cIn Los Angeles, our parks include everything from neighborhood recreation centers and open spaces to theaters, beaches, lakes, aquariums, equestrian centers, golf courses, historic homes and gardens. They are the shared treasures of our community,\u201d said Lindsey Kozberg, executive director of the Los Angeles Parks Foundation, a nonprofit that formed in 2008 as a response to budget cuts to park programs during the recession.\nKozberg said parks funding could be in danger once again, given the nearly $1-billion budget shortfall the city is facing. If the trend continues, by 2050, it\u2019ll likely require a mix of philanthropic funding and community partnerships to make sure every Angeleno has a safe and accessible park to visit.\n\u201cThere are more than 500 parks across the city alone, and they encompass a wild and wonderful collection of spaces,\u201d she said.\nBy 2050, the city could have even more by simply rethinking spaces that already exist. Kozberg suggested converting neighborhood schoolyards into public parks on nights and weekends \u2014 a cost-effective option since the city wouldn\u2019t have to build anything new.\nJordan Lang, president of McCourt Partners, said gathering places have become so much more important in the age of the internet, and investing in them is vital to the growth of the city.\nLang serves as president of Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies, the limited liability company behind the controversial proposed gondola system that would take baseball fans from Union Station to Dodger Stadium. The aerial transportation hasn\u2019t been approved, as the environmental impact report needs sign-off from a handful of government agencies.\n\u201cThis is a test case of what we can do in L.A.,\u201d Lang said, adding that it would also serve nearby Elysian Park, getting people out of their cars and into green spaces.\nBy 2050, he envisions massive, well-funded parks and public spaces filled with people both day and night. Such spaces will be inviting, constantly programmed with community events, and easy to get to via public transportation.\n\u201cL.A. is an incredible place to live,\u201d Lang said. \u201cPeople will keep moving here. We need to create a city that makes them want to stay.\u201d"

      "text": "A second act for empty office space? How skyscrapers in downtown L.A. could ease the housing crisis\n- Share via\nThe transformation of a sleek, granite-clad office tower on the edge of the 110 Freeway into deluxe apartments is about to begin, and developer Garrett Lee thinks the nearly 40-year-old building can be competitive with downtown L.A.\u2019s much newer upmarket housing.\nA mock-up of an apartment assembled in the L.A. Care tower on 7th Street reveals high ceilings, tall windows and sweeping views of the city that speak to the appeal of urban living.\nIt could also be a harbinger of what\u2019s to become of other fancy office towers.\nWith downtown\u2019s office rental market mired in high vacancies and falling values, stakeholders are clamoring for more city support to convert high-rises to housing that would help address the city\u2019s persistent housing shortage.\nAmong the suggested targets for conversion are elite Financial District towers that commanded top rents before offices were shut down by COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home orders, leaving many buildings more than one-third vacant.\nDespite myriad challenges \u2014 including a sprawling homeless population and its reputation as a sometimes dodgy place to live and work \u2014 downtown L.A. continues to defy the odds by attracting a steady stream of new residents.\nFailure to make at least some of them into housing could be financially catastrophic for taxpayers, according to a new study commissioned by the Central City Assn. of Los Angeles, a downtown business advocacy group that says the city should consider giving developers financial incentives to convert their buildings.\nOffice values have fallen dramatically in recent sales, and many owners are seeking public reappraisals of their buildings in hope of reducing their property taxes. When assessed values of buildings are reduced, so are the taxes collected by the county and shared with the city, school districts and other public entities.\n\u201cDeclining assessed values are likely to translate into significant losses in General Fund revenue\u201d for the city, according to the report by BAE Urban Economics, a Berkeley real estate consulting firm.\nEfforts to create a second act for underused office towers that were the height of corporate prestige a generation ago are part of a larger drama playing out in a financial center that has lost much of its shine in the years since the pandemic started.\nRestaurants and shops have struggled with the departure of many workers while homelessness and a sense that sidewalks aren\u2019t safe have risen and helped lead to the departure of some office tenants.\nDowntown L.A. has 54 office buildings that are at immediate risk of devaluation and could result in nearly $70 billion in lost value over the next 10 years, the report said, creating a potential loss of $353 million in property tax revenues.\nBuildings potentially would have more value as apartments or condominiums and could make a dent in expected tax losses. Converting just 10 big office buildings to housing would boost their combined assessed property value over a decade by $12 billion, adding $46 million in tax revenue and creating more than 3,800 residential units, the report said.\nMeanwhile, demand for housing in downtown L.A. has held steady even as the need for offices has waned. Occupancy in apartments has remained about 90% for more than a year, slightly higher than the level before the pandemic. And unlike most neighborhoods in Los Angeles County, downtown has seen a monumental housing construction boom in recent years.\nIn the last decade, 22% of the new housing in the city has been built downtown, where city planning policies encourage dense development, according to the DTLA Alliance business improvement district.\nTo be sure, downtown will retain its identity as a white-collar business center even as its housing component grows. At 56.5 million square feet, downtown is one of the largest office markets in the country and is an important economic engine for the city, said Nella McOsker, president of the Central City Assn.\nBusiness leaders in the association will continue to support efforts to refill office buildings with workers, she said, even as they encourage the conversion of some buildings to housing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up on folks coming into the office in large numbers,\u201d McOsker said, \u201cbut we need to always evolve.\u201d\nA new luxury residential tower in downtown L.A. reflects an unusual disconnect: While office rentals continue to struggle, downtown as a residential center is thriving.\nThe BAE Urban Economics report does not identify the 10 buildings used to calculate the financial effects of converting them to housing, but previous discussions of prime candidates have included some of the most prominent towers on the city skyline that were built in the latter part of the 20th century.\nAmong them are 777 Tower and Union Bank Plaza, both on Figueroa Street, and Gas Company Tower at the foot of Bunker Hill near Pershing Square.\nThe list of conversion candidates is confidential because publicizing them might \u201cput a scarlet letter around their neck\u201d when most are \u201cactually very good office buildings,\u201d said John Adams, a managing principal at Gensler. The architecture firm selected potential candidates for conversion, which have recently faced financial straits and low occupancy.\nThe Gas Company Tower was sold to Los Angeles County last year for about $200 million, a steep drop from its $632-million valuation in 2020. The 777 Tower traded a year ago for $120 million, a 70% drop from its 2013 sale price, according to real estate data provider CoStar.\nUnion Bank Plaza, a 40-story tower completed in 1967, is an attractive candidate in part because it has a retail complex at the base that would be a good amenity for residents as well as office tenants, Adams said.\nThe 55-story 777 Tower, completed in 1991, was designed by architect C\u00e9sar Pelli, who designed some of the world\u2019s tallest buildings including the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Part of its appeal is that it has separate banks of elevators for different tiers of floors, Adams said, which could make it easier to convert some floors to housing while others remain offices. With renovations, residents could have a separate lobby entrance from office workers.\nMany early 20th century office buildings downtown have already been converted to apartments and hotels, but housing advocates are now eyeing the newer generation of towers that dominated the office market in the last three decades.\nAmong them are ripe candidates to become residences, mostly built from the 1970s to 1990s, Adams said.\nTheir \u201cslick glass-and-marble aesthetic\u201d is visually appealing, he said, and they were built in a way that the outer skins can be modified to include balconies and operable windows.\n\u201cThese towers are hackable,\u201d Adams said.\nThe city is close to adopting a new building code that will make it easier for developers to get approvals to convert offices built after 1975. A previous code for conversions that focused on buildings erected before that year, when construction standards were less stringent, led to a boom in office, apartment, condo and hotel conversions starting in the early 2000s.\nAn uptick in lease signings in downtown Los Angeles has led some to hope the office rental market has hit bottom, but instead of waiting for tenants to return others are converting offices into apartments.\nNewer buildings such as the L.A. Care tower are \u201cnight and day\u201d more attractive to convert to housing than the midcentury buildings Lee\u2019s company, Jamison Properties, has converted in the past, he said.\nDowntown\u2019s Class A buildings have more modern systems such as elevators and electrical service, and may require fewer upgrades to meet seismic standards than older structures. The city recently determined that Jamison Properties did not need to perform a structural retrofit of the L.A. Care tower at 1055 W. 7th St., Lee said.\nLos Angeles County officials, meanwhile, have declared that Gas Company Tower is seismically safe, but are reviewing bids to perform more than $230 million worth of proactive upgrades \u201cto ensure that the building performs optimally in the decades ahead,\u201d a representative said.\nThe highest hurdle for private landlords considering turning an office building into apartments or condos is typically financial; it often costs more to acquire and convert a building than can be justified by expected rents.\nCity leaders should consider offering financial incentives such as those found in other cities to bridge the gap to profitability, the report said, citing programs in other central business districts.\nNew York, Washington and Boston have property tax abatement programs, for example. San Francisco offers transfer tax exemptions, and Chicago uses tax-increment financing to encourage some redevelopments. In Canada, Calgary offers direct grants.\nThe Central City Assn. wants the city to consider financial incentives for conversions, even though it is experiencing budget shortfalls, McOsker said. As of May, the city faced a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall.\nMcOsker suggested that the city form a team to focus on conversions and perhaps do it at a scale \u201cwell outside of downtown Los Angeles.\u201d\nHelping turn unused offices into housing is important to city officials, said Rachel Freeman, deputy mayor of business and economic development.\n\u201cWe have a deep need for more housing at all levels of affordability,\u201d she said. \u201cAdaptive reuse has the potential to be a tool to help achieve our goals towards housing production and also the revitalization of our core urban centers.\u201d\nZoning and building codes should be \u201cmore supportive\u201d of the process, she said, adding that the mayor\u2019s office also is open to the idea of financial incentives for builders.\nFor the vibrancy of downtown and other core business centers also facing falling office values, Freeman said, \u201cthere is a cost to doing nothing.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The Los Angeles City Council has approved a 51-story residential skyscraper in the South Park neighborhood, which will feature 536 rental units and retail spaces. Despite high demand for housing, construction faces challenges due to rising costs and financial uncertainties, prompting some developers to consider selling approved projects. Meanwhile, downtown L.A. continues to attract new residents, maintaining a steady occupancy rate of around 90%, as stakeholders advocate for converting underused office spaces into housing to address the city's ongoing housing crisis.",
