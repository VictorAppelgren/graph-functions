  "content": "As artificial intelligence tools make their way into offices, warehouses, hospitals, and even city streets, labor unions are intensifying efforts to curb their use through state-level legislation. According to the Washington Post, unions across the country are partnering with lawmakers to enact restrictions aimed at protecting jobs and limiting the reach of automation in sensitive industries.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nThe push comes in the wake of a failed federal proposal that would have prevented states from regulating AI for a decade. With that moratorium defeated in the Senate, unions see an opening to influence how technology such as robotaxis, productivity-tracking software, and other AI-driven systems are deployed. Per the Washington Post, this state-focused strategy could complicate industry expansion plans in sectors eager to adopt AI for efficiency gains.\n\nIn Massachusetts, the Teamsters are backing a bill that would require autonomous vehicles to carry a human safety operator who can step in if needed \u2014 a move that would effectively block fully driverless operations. In Oregon, a recently passed measure prohibits AI from using the title \u201cnurse\u201d or related abbreviations, legislation championed by the Oregon Nurses Association. These are part of a growing patchwork of rules unions hope will safeguard workers from job losses and protect professional integrity.\n\nThe American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) recently launched a national task force to coordinate state efforts. Union leaders warn that AI could trigger widespread job displacement and erode labor rights if left unchecked. AI has already become a flashpoint in labor disputes, including the Hollywood writers\u2019 strike of 2023.\n\nSurveys suggest that concerns are widespread. A Gallup poll earlier this year found that roughly one-third of U.S. workers worry AI will reduce job opportunities. Supporters of AI adoption counter that historically, disruptive technologies have also generated new categories of employment.\n\nLorena Gonzalez, co-chair of the AFL-CIO task force, compared the potential impact of AI to the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, which she said reshaped U.S. employment patterns through outsourcing. \u201cWe cannot allow AI and technology to be our next NAFTA,\u201d she said during an episode of Northeastern University\u2019s \u201cPower At Work\u201d podcast. \u201cIt is up to us to determine what kind of society we want to live in and what kind of regulations we live around that protect us.\u201d\n\nPolitical divides over AI regulation remain sharp. Per the Washington Post, former President Donald Trump has rolled back AI rules introduced under President Joe Biden, signaling an intent to grant broad freedom to technology companies and their clients.\n\nIn the coming months, the AFL-CIO task force plans to work with unions on strategies for addressing AI in collective bargaining, drafting model legislation for states based on existing bills in places like California and Massachusetts. Union advocates say the fight over AI rules will be central to the future of work in America.",
