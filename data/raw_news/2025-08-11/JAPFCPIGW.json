  "title": "Real Madrid\u2019s breakout star for 2025-26: Arda Guler ready to deliver on his promise",
  "description": "After a stop-start first two years at the Bernabeu, everything is in place for the Turkish youngster to shine under new coach Xabi Alonso",
  "content": "The final image of Arda Guler before the players\u2019 summer break was a symbolic one for Real Madrid\u2019s young playmaker.\n\nAfter landing at Madrid\u2019s Barajas airport following their Club World Cup semi-final exit, the cameras captured the Turkish midfielder and Luka Modric saying an affectionate goodbye. With Modric set to leave at the end of his contract following that tournament after 13 seasons at the Bernabeu, the 39-year-old gave Guler, 19 years his junior, his No 10 shirt as a gift.\n\nThat gesture would have been even more significant if Guler had actually inherited Modric\u2019s squad number, as was his intention, according to those close to him. Instead, the club decided that iconic shirt will now go to Kylian Mbappe, who already wears No 10 for France\u2019s national team. That was despite Guler having been at the club a year longer than the Frenchman, which is usually a factor in deciding who gets which jersey at Madrid.\n\nIn any case, with Modric now having joined Milan as a free agent after winning 28 titles with Madrid \u2014 more than any other player in the club\u2019s history \u2014 Guler wants to follow a similar path in what will be this third season at the club.\n\n\u201cArda is delighted with Xabi (Alonso, Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s replacement as head coach),\u201d people close to the player \u2014 who, like all those cited in this article, asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships \u2014 told The Athletic during the Club World Cup. And it is precisely that connection with Madrid\u2019s new coach that could lead to Guler\u2019s breakout campaign with the Spanish side.\n\nIt has been a stop-start first two years for Guler since joining from Fenerbahce in July 2023 for \u20ac20million ($23m; \u00a317m at current exchange rates) plus potential add-ons worth up to another \u20ac10m. The club spoke highly of him after his first training sessions, while internal sources were impressed by his quality, in particular his ability with his left foot.\n\nThat bright start was cut short when he had to return from Madrid\u2019s pre-season tour to the United States that summer due to a knee problem that resulted in surgery. He was sidelined for 148 days, missing 29 games for club and country due to that issue and two further muscle injuries.\n\nGuler ended up playing only 440 minutes across 12 appearances in that debut campaign, scoring six goals. Five of those came in the final month of the league season, when Ancelotti gave him five starts with the Spanish title already wrapped up. A bright Euro 2024 with Turkey followed, leading many to believe that last season could be his moment, but it proved another false dawn.\n\nGuler was the 17th-most used player in the Madrid squad, with 1,948 minutes across 43 matches. He scored five times and provided nine assists, but was rarely trusted by Ancelotti in important games. He did not participate at all in the Champions League play-off against Manchester City, the subsequent round of 16 tie derby games with Atletico Madrid, or the quarter-final loss to Arsenal. He was not used in the semis or final of the Supercopa de Espana either, having played just two minutes in each of the UEFA Super Cup and the final of the annual version of the Club World Cup, now rebranded as the Intercontinental Cup.\n\nThese regular absences did not go down well within the club or among the fanbase, with the press regularly asking Ancelotti about the situation. The manager became tense when facing those questions, even suggesting that Guler was being badly advised by those around him.\n\n\u201cI spend a little part of the time with him, and then he spends a lot of time with other people,\u201d said Ancelotti in February. \u201cI don\u2019t know if these other people have the same idea as me about what I think is the best for him to learn, improve and soon be able to play for Real Madrid. It\u2019s a lack of communication.\u201d\n\nThat sort of talk disappointed people close to Guler. Reports suggested his family had complained to the club, although this was denied by those close to him, who said his father only speaks Turkish.\n\nMeanwhile, Guler did get to play more towards the end of the season, and caused Ancelotti to change his tune. He showed fine control before scoring from outside the box to give Madrid a 1-0 win against Getafe in April, while playing as a midfielder. A week later, he scored and provided an assist to help his side to a 3-2 defeat of Celta Vigo, which he started. \u201cTwo months ago, I threw a stick at those around him, and now I have to congratulate them,\u201d Ancelotti said after the latter game.\n\nThe early-summer arrival of Alonso, who sounded out the possibility of signing Guler when he was in his previous job as manager of Germany\u2019s Bayer Leverkusen, has opened up new horizons for the Turkish youngster.\n\nIn June, Madrid signed promising winger Franco Mastantuono from River Plate of Argentina for a total fee of \u20ac63.2million, which could have been seen as a threat, given they play in similar positions. But Guler had already been informed he would begin the 2025-26 season playing further back in midfield, as he did for Alonso at the Club World Cup. He started five of Madrid\u2019s six matches during that tournament, all except the group-stage opener against Al Hilal, and was their ninth-most-used player, with 423 minutes, scoring a goal and providing two assists to get fans enthused about his performances.\n\nGuler himself seemed happy, too. \u201cThe coach is trying to make us have more control of the game, and that\u2019s better for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happier because I play and play in the middle.\u201d\n\nAlonso, meanwhile, sent out a statement of intent as he spoke about his management of young talent. \u201cIt\u2019s time to invest in Arda\u2019s progress and development,\u201d he said, \u201cand let him know that he can make mistakes.\u201d\n\nWith the injuries apparently behind him and plenty of confidence flowing his way from Alonso, many inside and outside the club are hoping this could finally be Guler\u2019s season.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to him to live up to those expectations.",

      "text": "Kylian Mbappe will wear the No 10 shirt for Real Madrid next season after choosing to switch from the No 9 he wore in his debut campaign.\nMbappe all but confirmed the change on social media on Wednesday, tweeting simply: \u201910\u2019.\nMadrid\u2019s No 10 shirt is vacant for the first time since 2017 following Luka Modric\u2019s departure from the club earlier this summer.\nAdvertisement\nSources close to the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, said the La Liga side had a policy of giving players preference for squad numbers based on their experience with the club.\nThe club, though, has the final say, and Mbappe has been given the No. 10, despite interest from team-mates who have been with Madrid longer, because of his significance as a player.\n10\n\u2014 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (@KMbappe) July 23, 2025\nMbappe also wears the No 10 shirt for France, having worn No 29 \u2013 for Monaco and in his first season at Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 and the No 7 at PSG from 2018 onwards.\nFormer Real Madrid No 10s include James Rodriguez, Mesut Ozil, Wesley Sneijder, Luis Figo and Clarence Seedorf.\nCristiano Ronaldo also changed his shirt number early into his Madrid career. Like Mbappe, the Portugal international wore the No 9 after joining the club from Manchester United in the summer of 2009. He inherited Raul\u2019s No 7 shirt from the 2010/11 season onwards.\nIn his debut season at the Santiago Bernabeu, Mbappe scored 44 goals and provided five assists in 59 games.\nReal Madrid\u2019s first game of the 2025/26 La Liga season is against Osasuna on August 19.\nAnalysis\nBy Guillermo Rai\nThere are plenty of iconic shirt numbers at Real Madrid, some more than others.\nThe most prestigious one is probably No 7, as it has been worn by club legends including Emilio Butragueno, Raul and Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 Mbappe\u2019s childhood idol.\nBut after that, the No 10 holds special significance, having been worn for the past seven seasons by Luka Modric. Apart from the Croatia midfielder, some of the illustrious names to have worn that number in the past include Luis Figo, Clarence Seedorf, Mesut Ozil, Michael Laudrup and Ferenc Puskas.\nMbappe has a personal story with it too. In the comic book he released about his life, one scene showed the Frenchman as a child unboxing a Real Madrid shirt for Christmas with the No 10 on the back.\nAdvertisement\nWith the No 7 occupied by Vinicius Junior, Mbappe will wear the same number he does for the French national team.\n\u201cA special number is offered to a very special player,\u201d is how club sources have described the move.\nIt also follows the announcement a week ago that Lamine Yamal would take the No 10 shirt so closely associated with Lionel Messi for Barcelona. Senior sources at Madrid expect Mbappe\u2019s change of shirt to have a positive commercial impact.\n(Photo: Buda Mendes/Getty Images)"

      "text": "When it comes to Xabi Alonso\u2019s Real Madrid, nothing seems to be a coincidence, and that applies to the emergence of Arda Guler.\nMadrid\u2019s new coach has been taking care of every detail since he took over in May, with the 20-year-old Turkey playmaker one of the main beneficiaries of his arrival.\nAfter their win against Borussia Dortmund in the Club World Cup quarter-finals, the coach and the player were seen heading to the team bus together as they left the MetLife Stadium.\nAdvertisement\nGuler had just delivered two brilliant assists to help Madrid progress to the semi-finals, where they will face Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.\n\u201cAssist maker!\u201d Luka Modric wrote alongside a fire emoji on Guler\u2019s Instagram post. \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn from him every day,\u201d Guler had answered when asked by The Athletic whether he can replace the veteran Croatia midfielder.\nView this post on Instagram\nFormer Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti had suggested to Guler that he could be the player to take the mantle of Modric and Toni Kroos, who retired last summer.\nThe youngster has become a key figure in the U.S., playing the ninth-most minutes in the squad (340), having finished 17th in that metric last season when Ancelotti was still in charge.\nGuler travelled to the U.S. this summer ready to make the step up to become a regular starter, and he is succeeding.\nAfter signing from Fenerbahce in the summer of 2023 for an initial \u20ac20million ($21.7m; \u00a317.1m), Guler\u2019s first season was beset by injuries. But in the final campaign with Ancelotti, his issue was a lack of opportunity. This caused unease within the club and among the fans and that hit a nerve with Ancelotti in press conferences.\nThe coach, who has since left to take charge of Brazil, justified himself by saying that, at Madrid, youngsters have to \u201csuck it up on the bench (chupar banquillo)\u201d before becoming undisputed starters.\nAlonso has taken a different view. \u201cArda is delighted with Xabi,\u201d sources close to Guler, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect relationships, told The Athletic.\nAlonso wanted to sign him when he was in charge of Bayer Leverkusen and in this new chapter, he is showing why. At the same time, the club have shown confidence in Guler.\nWhen Madrid executives and the coach were pushing to finalise the signing of Franco Mastantuono from River Plate, Guler knew he would be playing as a midfielder this season. He was told that the arrival of the Argentine, who plays on the right wing, would not pose a threat to his playing time.\nAdvertisement\nGuler started the Club World Cup as a substitute, but Alonso sent him to warm up in the 10th minute of Madrid\u2019s opener against Al Hilal and brought him on in the 46th minute. Despite the 1-1 draw, Guler convinced everyone and has been key since.\nHe scored in the 3-1 win against Pachuca, making him the youngest player (at 20 years and 57 days) to score 10 goals for Madrid in a season across all competitions since at least the 2009-2010 campaign, when Opta began recording this stat, surpassing Vinicius Junior\u2019s record (20 years and 80 days), which was set in 2020.\nGuler\u2019s prominence has grown in front of the media, too. He has been chosen by the club to speak on three occasions during the competition, despite not speaking much Spanish and not being particularly fluent in English.\nWhen asked about the differences between Ancelotti and Alonso, Guler explained that \u201cthe coach is trying to make us have more control of the game, that\u2019s better for me\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019m happier because I play and play in the middle.\u201d\nHe reaffirmed the view before the Dortmund game. \u201cAll is good because I have started all the last three games, I played very good, the coach is happy and the team is happy with me.\u201d\nMinutes later, Alonso backed him when answering whether Guler could be stronger defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s a time to invest in Arda\u2019s progress and development,\u201d he said. \u201cLet him know that he can make mistakes.\u201d\nGuler promptly delivered his most complete game of the tournament. He immediately showed his evolution into a more versatile player, first recovering a ball and then a minute later controlling with the sole of his boot before masterfully setting up Gonzalo Garcia\u2019s 10th-minute opener.\n\u201cWe talked about it before the game,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cHe had told me that if he had space he would put it to me, (he asked me) to be there. I was just there, the pass was sweet, like the other day with Trent (Alexander-Arnold), and all I had to do was push it in.\u201d\nGuler showed his versatility. He started as an organising midfielder and ended up as a playmaker and even out wide, too. From there, he linked up with Kylian Mbappe, who made it 3-1.\nAdvertisement\nMadrid fended off interest from other clubs, including Barcelona, to sign him in 2023.\nAt that time, he did not have a natural place in the squad but was seen as an outstanding talent whom they just had to sign. Under Alonso\u2019s guidance, Guler is silencing any doubts.\n(Top photo: Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Giorgi Mamardashvili pawed the free kick away. As he did, his Georgian team-mates ran over to celebrate as if he had scored. His compatriots in the press tribune in the Westfalenstadion turned to their colleagues, grasped their arms and said: \u201cThe best in the world. The best goalkeeper in the world.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMamardashvili was the hero when Georgia qualified for a European Championship for the first time since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. When the 23-year-old goalkeeper flew to his left and saved Tasos Bakasetas\u2019 penalty in the play-off against Greece, he flew his nation to Dortmund too.\nThe stop he made on Hakan Calhanoglu was no ordinary one, either. Turkey\u2019s captain made a name for himself a decade ago by slamming a free kick past Borussia Dortmund for Hamburg from all of 40 yards.\nOn Tuesday, Mamardashvili denied Calhanoglu to keep the score at 1-1. Only special strikes eluded the Valencia No 1. Mert Muldur\u2019s supernatural opener deserved an X-File of its own. When Mamardashvili\u2019s goalkeeper coach Davit Gvaramadze studies the tape, he will no doubt classify it under unexplained phenomena; a once-in-a-lifetime sighting of a Fenerbahce full-back, renowned more for his speed than the sonic boom unleashed in Dortmund.\nTurkish delight in Dortmund! \u26bd\ufe0f#BBCEuros #Euro2024 #TURGEO pic.twitter.com/ENbdVJPr8I\n\u2014 BBC Sport (@BBCSport) June 18, 2024\nAbsolute class. \ud83d\udc4f\nIs this the goal of the tournament so far from Mert M\u00fcld\u00fcr and Turkey? \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 pic.twitter.com/DLNUpkIMiO\n\u2014 FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 18, 2024\nUnfortunately for Mamardashvili, half an hour from Georgia\u2019s first point in this competition, another alien appeared. Arda Guler looked like a kid who had come to watch the game in full kit. His waif-like physique and choir-boy looks contrasted with the grown men around him. But his presence in the game was disproportionate for his size and 19 years of age.\nNominally on the right side of Turkey\u2019s attack, Guler played in the half-spaces. He let Muldur or the very eager Baris Yilmaz provide the width on that flank. He came short and showed for the ball, taking playmaking responsibilities off Calhanoglu, his skipper. Some of Turkey\u2019s earliest chances arrived from his corner kicks. Kenan Yildiz\u2019s disallowed goal was a tap-in at the far post from one of his pullbacks. Pushed off the ball only once, the dribbler Guler even tracked back midway through the first half to stop the dribbler Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.\nAdvertisement\nCreditably, he upstaged last season\u2019s Serie A MVP. He upshot Mamardashvili, too.\nGuler has drawn comparisons with Mesut Ozil for the elegance he shows on the ball. He clearly hasn\u2019t joined him in the weight room where Ozil is spending much of his retirement, but behind his dainty figure is a shot power Ozil never possessed \u2014 an attribute he demonstrated when he piledrived Turkey\u2019s go-ahead goal past Mamardashvili from 30 yards.\nThe goal made Guler the first teenager to score at a European Championship since Cristiano Ronaldo 20 years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t care about personal achievements,\u201d Guler said, as he sat next to Vincenzo Montella in the post-match press conference, looking every bit like the teacher\u2019s pet. Montella, his raven black hair slicked back in the style of Pier Paolo Pasolini, had withdrawn Guler 10 minutes from time and embraced him as he received a standing ovation from a vociferous crowd. It felt like all of the 23,000 Turkish residents in Dortmund were singing his name.\nJose Mourinho must wish Guler were still a Fenerbahce player. Instead, the coach texting him after the game, Guler revealed, was Carlo Ancelotti.\n\u201cMister Ancelotti is motivating me a lot,\u201d he said. The Real Madrid head coach also tried to bring the timid-looking Guler out of his shell. \u201cI want to introduce you to a \u2018chico muy interesante\u2019,\u201d Ancelotti addressed the crowd during Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League celebrations. He passed the microphone to Guler, who, after some encouragement, came forward and adorably said, \u201cHola Madridistas. We are family. Gracias por todos!\u201d\nUp until then, they had not seen much of him. No sooner had he arrived from Istanbul than he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.\n\u201cHe started the season with an injury that dragged on,\u201d Montella said. \u201cHe played little until the end of March.\u201d But once he did\u2026 Guler finished the season with six La Liga goals in 10 appearances as Madrid also clinched the league title. He hit the woodwork from just inside the Osasuna half in one of his first games back from injury.\nGuler\u2019s relative ability to hit the ground running validated his decision not to go out on loan straight after joining Madrid. Instead of taking an intermediary step, like Takefusa Kubo and Martin Odegaard had done in the past with Real Sociedad, he already felt ready to compete with Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham, Brahim Diaz and Luka Modric.\n| Group F | MP | W | D | L | GD | PTS |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nPortugal | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 6 |\nTurkey | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | -1 | 3 |\nCzech Republic | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | -1 | 1 |\nGeorgia | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | -2 | 1 |\n\u201cThe Euros are an opportunity for him to show his worth,\u201d Montella said. \u201cHe goes into it in the best possible mental condition after winning the Champions League and La Liga.\u201d\nMatchday in Dortmund also happened to be the coach\u2019s 50th birthday. \u201cI already received a beautiful gift,\u201d Montella gushed, gesturing to Guler. \u201cThe perfect present, the best I could get.\u201d If the Italian manages to unwrap more of Guler\u2019s potential this summer, Turkey could go far.\n(Top photo: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images)"
