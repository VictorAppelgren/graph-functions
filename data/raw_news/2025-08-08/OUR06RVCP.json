  "description": "South Park\u2019s latest episode mocks Trump\u2019s immigration agenda by demeaning DHS head Kristi Noem and ICE agents",
  "content": "Border czar Tom Homan is not happy with South Park\u2019s latest episode mocking the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation plan by ridiculing Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nJoining Chris Cuomo on his News Nation show on Thursday evening, Homan remained straight-faced while talking about the satirical show\u2019s depiction of ICE recruiting unqualified citizens to conduct immigration raids while covering their faces in shame.\n\n\u201cI thought the parody was just in bad form and certainly, certainly bad timing,\u201d Homan said on Cuomo.\n\nHoman, who served as the acting director of ICE during Trump\u2019s first administration, said the show was wrong to poke fun at ICE agents who often wear face coverings, hats, and sunglasses to protect their identities.\n\nHoman claimed rhetoric that mocks ICE \u201cemboldened\u201d the \u201csmall percentage of the left\u201d who assault ICE officers to continue attacks. He claimed that assaults on ICE agents were up \u201cover a thousand percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails or threatening ICE agents, or putting hands on ICE agents, they feel emboldened the more and more they see this bad rhetoric coming out,\u201d Homan said\n\nPublic reaction to immigration raids has mainly been adverse and spurred some attacks on ICE agents, including doxxing incidents in which people have shared information about the person behind the ICE uniform. Some ICE agents have also become targets of violent physical attacks and Molotov cocktail attacks.\n\nTo counteract incidents, ICE agents have tried to conceal their identities while on the job, and the federal government has used the National Guard or military to protect agents as they take suspects into custody.\n\nSouth Park\u2019s latest episode, titled \u201cGot a Nut,\u201d aimed at the Trump administration, in a similar manner to the season 27 premiere. This time, it critiqued the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration agenda.\n\nIn the episode, Noem is depicted as a dog-shooting law enforcement officer who asks ICE recruits to racially profile people while conducting immigration raids.\n\nMr. Mackey, the dim-witted guidance counselor at South Park Elementary School, decides to sign up to be an ICE agent to increase funding to the school, which has been reduced as a result of government cuts \u2013 a reference to the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s work.\n\nThe joke is that ICE has low standards when hiring recruits.\n\nIn the episode, Vice President JD Vance is also featured as Trump\u2019s physically small sidekick.\n\nIn a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, a spokesperson said, \u201cWe want to thank South Park for drawing attention to ICE law enforcement recruitment. We are calling on patriotic Americans to help us remove murderers, gang members, pedophiles, and other violent criminals from our country.\n\n\u201cBenefits available to new ICE recruits include an up to $50,000 signing bonus, student loan forgiveness, and retirement benefits,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nHoman echoed the benefits of joining ICE on Thursday evening, saying that the agency chose to open up the opportunity to recruits because it was in such high demand.",

      "text": "ICE arrests dropped in July as backlash to raids and mass deportation plans stalled operations\nArrests by immigration agents fell, but daily removals were up in July, data shows\nThe pace of daily immigration arrests fell nearly 20 percent in July, as the Trump administration confronted court challenges, threats against agents, and continued protests against its mass deportation plans.\nBetween July 1 and 27, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement averaged 990 daily arrests, down from 1,224 the previous month, according to government data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonpartisan research project based at Syracuse University.\nDespite the slowing pace of arrests, which federal officials partially pinned on a series of recent California court rulings stopping agents from making indiscriminate arrests across the state, removals from the country were up an average of 84 more people per day during the same period.\n\"Despite a historic number of injunctions \u2014 including the (temporary restraining order) in Los Angeles \u2014 ICE continues to arrest the worst of the worst,\" Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Axios, which first reported on the drop. \"From gang members and terrorists to pedophiles, everyday ICE is removing these barbaric criminal illegal aliens from American communities.\u201d\nThe figures fall well short of the reported 3,000 arrests per day that White House deputy chief of staff and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller has reportedly urged agents to achieve.\nMiller told Fox News in June that agents had been set a target of a \u201cminimum\u201d of 3,000 arrests a day, though the administration has since said in court there\u2019s no formal arrest quota in place.\nNonetheless, mass immigration raids have still shaken communities across the country.\nAgents carried out a major operation against two legal cannabis farms in Southern California on July 10, leading to at least 361 arrests, according to federal officials.\nIn the chaos, a man fell from a green house and died, and hundreds of protesters faced off against immigration agents.\nGuadalupe Torres said her husband, George Retes, 25, an Army veteran and U.S. citizen who works as a security guard at Glass House Farms in Camarillo, was among those arrested, leaving her to fruitlessly call local law enforcement agencies to find out where he was being detained\n\"He really did try to leave, so I don't know what's going to happen from here. I really hope I get a phone call or something, because I'm getting torn apart. My kids are asking where their dad is. I keep having to lie, saying he's at work,\" Torres told ABC 7 at the time.\nRetes, who said he told agents he was a U.S. citizen working legally at the farm, was subsequently released without charge, and said he plans to sue, though he\u2019s not sure which agency arrested him and held him in downtown Los Angeles for several days.\n\"No one should be put in this position. It doesn't matter if you're an immigrant, it doesn't matter the color of your skin. It doesn't matter if you voted left, it doesn't matter if you voted right... No one deserves to be treated this way,\" Retes told reporters in July. \"It shouldn't have happened and I hope this never happens to anyone ever again.\"\nOn the ground, the nature of immigration raids has diverged slightly in red and blue states under the second Trump administration.\nIn red states, about 60 percent of immigration arrests have taken place in prisons and jails, while 70 percent of arrests in blue states took place in the wider community, according to a CNN analysis.\nThe split is partially a result of many Democrat-led jurisdictions limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials.\nIn practice, advocates say, it leads to harsher enforcement tactics against liberal areas with large immigrant populations.\nIv\u00e1n Espinoza-Madrigal, the executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights, told CNN he sees \u201ca deliberate federal strategy to punish Massachusetts and other immigrant-friendly states for standing up against Trump\u2019s reckless deportation machine.\u201d\nThe federal government, meanwhile, says the continued demonization of immigration agents has put them in danger and hampered operations.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in July that agents are facing an 830 percent increase in assaults, though federal officials thus far have not provided detailed evidence of their claims.\nImmigration operations are expected to scale up exponentially in the coming years, thanks to an infusion of about $170 billion in border and immigration funding as part of the administration\u2019s One Big, Beautiful Bill spending package.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

The Los Angeles Times and other outlets report the deal was worth $1.5 billion.\nIn the episode, Trump sues the town of South Park when its residents challenge the presence of Jesus Christ \u2013 the actual person \u2013 in its elementary school.\nJesus tells them they ought to settle.\n\u201cYou guys saw what happened to CBS? Yeah, well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cDo you really want to end up like Colbert?\u201d\nCBS and parent Paramount Global canceled Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d last week, days after Colbert sharply criticized Paramount's settlement of Trump\u2019s lawsuit over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview.\nCBS and Paramount executives said it was a financial decision to axe \u201cThe Late Show.\u201d\nThe efficiency of \u201cSouth Park\u201d production, and the brinksmanship of its creators, allow it to stay incredibly current for an animated series.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what next week\u2019s episode is going to be,\u201d Parker said at Comic-Con. \u201cEven just three days ago, we were like, \u2018I don\u2019t know if people are going to like this.\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "Trump VP candidate Kristi Noem sparks backlash for \u2018twisted\u2019 admission of killing her dog\nIn her new book, due to be released next month, the South Dakota governor described the dog as \u2018less than worthless\u2019 and also claimed to have also killed a \u2018nasty and mean\u2019 goat\nOne of the candidates in the running to be Donald Trump\u2019s pick for Vice President has admitted that she once shot a pet puppy that she \u201chated\u201d.\nKristi Noem wrote about an incident with the dog, named Cricket, who she called \u201cuntrainable\u201d and \u201cless than worthless\u201d. She also claimed to have put down an unnamed, family-owned goat because he was \u201cnasty and mean\u201d.\nMs Noem, the Governor of South Dakota is seen as a leading contender to be Mr Trump\u2019s running mate for the November presidential election.\nHer revelations about killing animals sparked outrage on Friday, with some describing her as \u201csick and twisted\u201d and \u201ctrash\u201d.\nHer anecdotes appear in her new book No Going Back: The Truth on What\u2019s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward \u2013 which will be published in the US next month. A copy has been obtained ahead of time by The Guardian.\nThe outlet reported that in the book, Ms Noem \u2013 who represented South Dakota in Congress for eight years before becoming governor \u2013 includes the story of Cricket\u2019s demise in order to illustrate how to do things in life, both personally and politically, which are \u201cdifficult, messy and ugly\u201d.\nThe governor describes how she took the puppy on a pheasant hunt with other dogs to teach her how to behave. However, she said the animal went \u201cout of her mind with excitement\u201d and scared off the birds.\nDespite Ms Noem\u2019s attempts to control Cricket with an electronic collar, the animal later attacked a group of chickens, \u201cgrabb[ing] one chicken at a time, crunching it to death with one bite, then dropping it to attack another\u201d. Cricket also later attempted to bite the governor herself, she writes.\nIn the book Ms Noem wrote a check for the damage to the owners of the chickens, who were weeping, and helped them dispose of the dead poultry. The dog, she writes, was \u201ca picture of joy\u201d throughout the ordeal.\n\u201cI hated that dog,\u201d Ms Noem writes, adding that Cricket had proved herself \u201cuntrainable\u201d, \u201cdangerous to anyone she came in contact with\u201d and \u201cless than worthless \u2026 as a hunting dog\u201d. She writes:\u201cAt that moment\u2026 I realised I had to put her down.\u201d\nShe then describes taking her gun and taking the dog to a gravel pit to be executed. \u201cIt was not a pleasant job,\u201d she writes, according to the outlet, \u201cbut it had to be done\u201d.\nMs Noem then recalls deciding to kill a \u201cnasty and mean\u201d male goat also owned by the family. She describes the uncastrated animal as smelling \u201cdisgusting, musky, rancid\u201d and frequently chasing her children and \u201cknocking them down\u201d.\nShe says she missed the first time she fired and had to return to her truck to retrieve another round of ammunition in order to finish the job.\nA construction crew reportedly witnessed her shoot both animals.\nMs Noem seemed unperturbed after the claims were reported in the media \u2013 in fact she appeared to double down on Friday, while promoting the book.\n\u201cWe love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years,\u201d she wrote on X.\n\u201cIf you want more real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that\u2019ll have the media gasping, preorder \u2018No Going Back\u2019.\u201d\nOthers were quick to condemn her. Former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews wrote: \u201cWhen I saw tweets about Kristi Noem murdering her puppy, I thought to myself, \u2018Damn, one of the other VP contenders\u2019 teams found some oppo,\u2019 until I realized SHE wrote about it in HER book.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why anyone would brag about this unless they\u2019re sick and twisted.\u201d\nRick Wilson, of anti-Trump group The Lincoln Project, wrote: \u201cKristi Noem is trash.\n\u201cDecades with hunting- and bird-dogs, and the number I\u2019ve killed because they were chicken-sharp or had too much prey drive is ZERO. Puppies need slow exposure to birds, and bird-scent. She killed a puppy because she was lazy at training bird dogs, not because it was a bad dog.\n\u201cNot every dog is for the field, but 99.9% of them are trainable or re-homeable. We have one now who was never going in the field, but I didn\u2019t kill her. She\u2019s sleeping on the couch.\n\u201cYou down old dogs, hurt dogs, and sick dogs humanely, not by shooting them and tossing them in a gravel pit. \u201c\nIn a statement shared with The Independent, Colleen O\u2019Brien, senior director of PETA, said Ms Noem failed to understand \u201cvital\u201d concepts such as \u201ccompromise and compassion.\u201d\n\u201cMost Americans love their dogs, and we suspect that they will consider Gov Noem a psychotic loony for letting this rambunctious puppy loose on chickens and then punishing her by deciding to personally blow her brains out rather than attempting to train her or find a more responsible guardian who would provide her with a proper home,\u201d Ms O\u2019Brien said.\n\u201cGov. Noem obviously fails to understand the vital political concepts of education, cooperation, compromise, and compassion.\u201d\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

We will only process your information in this way where you have given us your permission.\nWhen you purchase products and services from third parties\nWe may also collect information about third party products and services which you purchase after visiting our website. For example, when you use a voucher code or click on a link to an affiliate site. However when you click on one of these affiliate links we don\u2019t receive any personal data about you, and we cannot link back the purchases to you specifically. Instead we receive aggregated, anonymous information such as which products have been bought by our readers and how many of them.\n2) Information from your devices\nCookies and other online identifiers\nWe collect data about our website\u2019s visitors using technology such as cookies, device IDs, IP addresses and general location or country. This may include your IP address, information about your browser or operating system and will include your email (only ever in secure \u2018hashed\u2019, pseudonymous form). If you would like to know more about our use of cookies and how to manage them, please read our Cookie Policy.\nIf you have purchased one of our subscriptions, this next section does not apply to you. If you accept the use of advertising cookies on our website, then when you use our website and enter your email address on our website (either to log in, or to sign up for a newsletter, or similar), we may share information that we collect from you with trusted partners. This may include your IP address, information about your browser or operating system or your email (only ever in secure \u2018hashed\u2019, pseudonymous form). Our partners use this information to create an online identification code to be able to recognise you on your devices. This code may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising, that is more relevant to you. This code does not contain any of your directly identifiable personal data and will not be used to re-identify you. We and the below partners process your data to create this code as joint controllers under data protection law.\nDetailed information on our partners\u2019 data processing activities is available in their privacy policies by clicking below.\nTo opt-out of your data being used by LiveRamp in this way, please visit https://liveramp.com/opt_out/\nTo opt out of your data being used by The Trade Desk in this way, please visit https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/\nWhen you enter your email address to create an account or sign-up to a newsletter or marketing, we may also share your email address in a hashed form with Amazon Publisher Services (APS). APS then links this hashed email to a profile which they may already hold related to that email address. The hashed email will be used in a secure, pseudonymised form within a cookie to flag to APS whenever you visit The Independent site. APS will use this to determine, in real-time, if any of their business customers want to market to a profile similar to yours. If this is the case they may initiate an advert which will appear to you on The Independent website.\nThe APS Privacy Notice can be found here: https://aps.amazon.com/aps/privacy-policy/\nPlease see our Cookie Policy for more information.\nWe are signed up to the latest version of IAB Europe\u2019s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) version 2.2 and comply with its specifications and policies. What this means is that we treat the personal information that we and our partners collect through cookies in a transparent and data privacy compliant way.\nMarket research, user testing panel and surveys\nFrom time to time we may ask you to participate in reader surveys, to help us improve our website and offering. Usually these will be anonymous, however if you choose to be contacted for future market research, we will ask for your name and contact information so we can get in touch with you. We will keep your personal data for only as long as we need it, after which we will delete it.\nWe use a third party survey provider for running our surveys, and we keep your data in the third party platform for three months to enable us to analyse your responses, after which we aggregate your responses and delete your personal data so it can no longer identify you.\nWe may ask you to attend face-to-face Zoom interviews with us or a partner that we have commissioned on our behalf. However, participation is voluntary and you are free to decline the invitations at any time. We may also send you links to short surveys and your responses to these surveys will be anonymous. If you agree to be a part of the panel, we will re-contact you after a year to ask if you wish to continue to be a part of the panel and give you a chance to opt out.\nWe may use the feedback you provide in our surveys or as part of our user testing panel, as quotes on our website, or in internal and external presentations in connection with the research study and our publications. However where we do this we will ensure that the quote is anonymous \u2013 unless you give us your permission to use your name, photograph or screenshots of you during any Zoom interviews.\n3) Information we generate about you.\nWhen you register for an Independent account, take out a subscription for The Independent or sign up for one of our newsletters, we assign you a unique ID number. We use your unique ID to recognise you when you are logged in. We also use it to ensure we remember your preferences such as which newsletter you have signed up to.\nFor readers who have not registered or subscribed, and are browsing our site anonymously, we assign you a unique ID number based on your device which remembers your browsing behaviour. This ID cannot identify you unless you then register or subscribe, after which we will link your anonymous browsing behaviour to your ID. This is so we can offer you a more personalised and engaging experience when you register or subscribe.\nWe also assign you a unique ID number which remembers your browsing behaviour. This includes how long you spend on an article, what types of articles you read (e.g. travel, politics, sports and so on) and how many, as well as how often you visit our website or app. This is so we can personalise the site and our communications to you, and where you have consented to this, we also deliver tailored advertising that is more relevant to your interests.\nWe provide each reader with a cookie ID for analytics purposes, so we can recognise when you come back on to our site using one of your devices such as your laptop or mobile phone. We do this so we know how many individuals come back to our site.\n4) Data we receive about you from other organisations.\nSometimes we obtain additional information about you from data management and consumer insight providers, such as Eyeota.\nThe data these companies may hold about you is collected from publicly available records, such as the electoral roll, or from other sources where you have agreed for your information to be shared with third parties.\nWe may then match you with the data that they hold in their database to find out demographic or household information about you. This ensures that the advertising you see is relevant if you consent to this.\nSocial media\nWe can also access limited information from social media activity such as when you \u2018like\u2019 the website, share content or follow us on Twitter or Facebook. When you sign in to our website using Google, we collect your name and email address. If you sign up for one of our newsletters on Facebook, we receive your email address so we can send you the newsletter you\u2019ve asked for. We may also receive demographic information from social media sites such as Facebook, including aggregated information on age and gender. However this cannot be linked back to you individually. This is used to tailor the advertising we show you if you\u2019ve agreed to receive personalised advertising.\nWe use personal data collected through our sites and apps only when we have a valid reason and the legal grounds to do so. The legal grounds may be one of the following:\nConsent.\nIf you have given us consent to send you specific newsletters, you can unsubscribe from these at any time. You can do this by clicking \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 at the bottom of each email (and additionally at the top of emails if you use Yahoo or Gmail), or by logging into your account and managing your email preferences.\nWe only conduct market research and send you surveys if you have consented to this.\nWe will send you push notifications from our apps, and/or send you browser notifications when you are visiting our app or website, only where you have consented.\nWe will only process your data for marketing purposes to inform you about our products, services or promotional offers that you might find interesting where you have consented to this.\nUnless you have purchased one of our subscriptions, you will be required to provide your consent to us processing your personal data for targeted advertising in order to access our content. The remaining paragraphs of this section apply to such non-subscribers.\nWe may tailor advertising you see on our website based on the type of articles you read, so it is more relevant to your interests. We do this by allocating your ID to relevant interest groups or segments based on your reading behaviour. For example, if you have read three articles about travel or commented on a travel article in the last 30 days, or if you have visited a travel website prior to coming onto our website we may place your ID into the travel segment, and you will subsequently be shown more travel-related advertising. If your reading behaviour is similar to that shown for our travel audience, we may include your ID in our \u2018lookalike\u2019 travel segment for some campaigns.\nWe will never use any sensitive data (also known as special category data) for this purpose. Please read our Cookie Policy for more information about this.\nWe may personalise advertising to you based on the information that you provide us when you register for an account. For example, we may aggregate your age (based on year of birth that you provide us when you register) into groups e.g. 24-35 year olds, if an advertiser would like to target their ad campaigns to this demographic. As well as using your online browsing behaviour and your demographic information to personalise the advertising you receive, we may also use this aggregated information for reporting and analytics purposes. For example, to see how well a particular ad campaign has performed.\nWe occasionally work with advertising partners to securely match the email addresses of our registered reader database with their customer databases, using our data matching service provider. This is so we can show ads to readers we and our partners have in common. All data is encrypted before it is matched, and neither party can directly identify an individual, nor see or access the other party\u2019s data. The data match service provider does not have access to any raw, unencrypted data.\nGenerally, this will be conducted at an aggregate audience level to provide insights, rather than individual level information, although your information may be used to generate these insights. These insights might include the overlap between our audiences and the client\u2019s, and other information that would be useful to understand for an advertising campaign to be effective.\nFor readers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, if you click the \u201cDo not share/sell my personal information\u201d button, which is in the website footer at the bottom of the home page, we will not recontact you about that choice for at least 12 months.\nLegitimate interests.\nLegitimate Interests are ways in which we use personal data that you would reasonably expect. These include:\n- Sending you service messages about your subscription or account registration, for example if you have clicked a password reset link. This could be by email, overlay on the website or push notification (if you\u2019ve consented to receiving app push or web browser notifications).\n- Granting you access to a subscription.\n- Dealing with any query or complaint you submit to our Customer Services team. Only provide sensitive data when relevant (such as information about your health, race or religion) if you are happy to consent to our using it to manage your enquiry.\n- Dealing with, and responding to you about queries in the comment section and other user generated content facilities.\n- Logging and using information about any service errors or interruptions that you have experienced in order to help us create fixes and to make technical improvements to our website.\n- Security and fraud prevention.\n- Verifying your identity and remembering you (for example when you return to the website and have already logged in).\n- Enabling you to share our content with others using social media or email.\n- Administering competitions and informing you if you have been successful in any competitions or promotions.\n- Keeping you updated about our products and services, in line with your communication preferences.\n- Monitoring the number of Premium articles you read as a registered user on The Independent website. This is so we can request users subscribe once they have read the maximum number of Premium articles over a given period of time.\n- Monitoring the number of articles you read on The Independent app. This is so that we can request users subscribe once they have read the maximum number of articles on the app.\n- Analysing what articles you have read so we can improve our content and make recommendations to you.\n- Improving the design and style of the website.\n- Responding to your feedback on our products, services and website and app functionality\n- Ensuring that we are paid the correct amount of commission by our advertising partners if you buy a product or service from our website.\n- Allowing us to measure advertising campaigns, ensure readers do not see the same advertisements too many times, and ensure advertisements are served in appropriate environments for our clients.\nPerformance of a contract.\nWhen you buy a subscription or another product or service from us, we will need to use your details in order to provide the item to you.

We may also provide them with audience demographics about an audience who viewed or interacted with a campaign.\nFor more information on what personal data we collect and how we use it, please refer to the sections above \u2018What personal information do we collect about you?\u2019 and \u2018What do we use your personal information for?\u2019.\nGovernment or regulatory bodies only if required by law\nWe reserve the right to disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws and government or regulatory bodies\u2019 lawful requests for information.\nOur service providers\nYour personal details may be shared with third party organisations we have contracted to provide services to us which include processing data.

      "text": "Inside the depraved world of migrant hunters using disturbing tactics to track down asylum hotels\nFar-right activists are descending on asylum hotels and livestreaming to thousands of followers as they hurl abuse at those who live and work there. Holly Evans reports how their actions are laying the groundwork for anti-migrant protests across the country and the violence that follows\nYou\u2019re a traitor.\u201d Those were the words heckled last week to a driver pulling into RAF Wethersfield, a former Ministry of Defence airbase in Essex currently being used to house asylum seekers.\nLivestreamed from an iPhone to tens ofthousands of people online, the clip shows a group of so-called migrant hunters hurling abuse at the driver, presumed to be a worker at the airbase, and threatening to publish his car\u2019s number plate.\nThis \u2013 verbally abusing staff and police officers on camera, before sharing the incident with fellow \u201cpatriots\u201d\u2013 appears to be the modus operandi of the self-proclaimed migrant hunters, who are on the rise amid growing unrest over the government\u2019s handling of the migration crisis.\nOften posing as journalists, these far-right activists will turn up at accommodation centres and hotels with the intention of harassing those who work and live there. They then post the footage online with the aim of \u2013 according to experts \u2013 laying the groundwork for anti-migrant protests, which often descend into violence.\nThey also use Facebook and X to spread information about the locations of hotels that have been earmarked by the government to house asylum seekers. A post shared time after time in this corner of the internet is an interactive map, purporting to show the location of more than 200 hotels across the UK where migrants live.\nTheir methods for identifying accommodation for asylum seekers appear to be a myriad of tip-offs from disgruntled employees at the hotels in question, information from locals, as well as meticulous monitoring of Booking.com to check which 3* hotels have been blocked out for mass bookings.\nSome of the most prominent migrant hunters have nearly 200,000 followers on X and tweet around 20 times a day, often peddling false and dangerous rumours about those inside the hotels. Among the more disturbing posts are unfounded claims of an upcoming terror attack, littered among AI-generated images of far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\nRecent research from the anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate found the number of migrant hunters had doubled since 2021 and that they had visited hotels housing asylum seekers on more than 250 occasions.\nBut activity on social media accounts connected to the movement has ramped up in recent weeks after anti-migrant protests in Epping, Essex, which triggered similar demonstrations across the country. The unrest began in July after an asylum seeker from Ethiopia, believed to be staying at the Bell Hotel, was charged with sexual assault, including that of a 14-year-old girl.\nSince then, protests have taken place in cities such as Manchester, London, Bournemouth and Edinburgh, with more planned for Friday evening as part of what organisers have called \u201cabolish asylum day\u201d \u2013 a mass protest at eight different locations across the country where asylum seekers are being housed.\nFar-right groups have been encouraging such protests for years, yet concerns are growing over the invasive tactics used by the migrant hunters, who appear to spend their time travelling to various hotels, doxxing their opposition and harassing those temporarily given refuge there.\nThey then use messaging apps such as Telegram, Signal and WhatsApp to share information.\nSpeaking to The Independent, Joe Mulhall, director of research at Hope Not Hate, said these individuals first became prominent online during the spring of 2021.\n\u201cOriginally they were on the beaches, filming the arrival of boats and doing daily tallies, before moving from areas like Dover to the accommodation centres. They were the content-creating machine that was sitting under the far right,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey would release daily vlogs and livestreams which would percolate through the far-right system and get picked up by people like Tommy Robinson. They have been quite important in pushing cross-Channel migration up the agenda of the far right.\u201d\nHaving analysed the locations of protests, the anti-racism charity spotted a pattern \u2013 hotels targeted during the summer of violence in 2024 had often been visited multiple times by migrant hunters.\nRiots were sparked across the UK last July after three girls were killed in a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, with a wave of misinformation on social media falsely claiming the killer was a Muslim asylum seeker.\nMr Mulhall added: \u201cWhere we saw those atrocious scenes and arson outside the Holiday Inn in Rotherham, migrant hunters had visited that hotel 12 times between 2021 and 2024. It\u2019s interesting because that hotel is not in the city centre \u2013 people knew where to go, migrant hunters had laid the groundwork.\u201d\nMomentum has picked up recently, and these activists are once again livestreaming themselves at protests, quickly racking up thousands of comments and clicks online.\nIn Epping, one protest organiser told The Independent they had been made aware that the Britannia Hotel in Canary Wharf, in London\u2019s financial district, was being repurposed by the Home Office after being contacted by an employee who had been made redundant.\nTwo protests broke out there after the information spread online.\nMeanwhile, one former soldier, who claims to have raised more than \u00a330,000 in donations to help fund an anti-migrant movement called the Great British National Protest, claims to be behind 20 demonstrations across the UK.\nRichard Donaldson, 33, told The Times the money raised would be used to fund \u201ccovert investigations inside hotels\u201d, and claimed to have recruited members of staff who were supposedly willing to wear hidden body cameras and share intelligence.\n\u201cThere has been a proliferation of online social media accounts that are promoting anti-migrant sentiments,\u201d Sabby Dhalu, co-convenor of Stand Up to Racism said.\n\u201cFirstly, since Elon Musk took over X, and secondly, since Donald Trump became president, there has been a shift in the algorithm, a bias towards far-right material. Such content is getting a wider reach.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed in our demonstrations that people say they are journalists and pick up their phones, but what they are really doing is doxxing people and identifying people they can target.\u201d\nOn Monday, the Home Office announced it was providing another \u00a3100m to tackle people smuggling and Sir Keir Starmer has struck a deal to return Channel migrants to France in exchange for asylum seekers with ties to the UK.\nWhile the move has been criticised by refugee charities, the government is hoping it will prevent an outbreak of similar disorder to that of last summer.\nEnver Solomon, CEO of Refugee Council, said: \u201cProtests against people seeking asylum is causing alarm among adults and children who have fled war in countries such as Sudan and Afghanistan.\n\u201cLast summer, we witnessed refugees we support fear for their lives as an angry mob tried to set fire to the hotel where they were living. Rhetoric that dehumanises people who\u2019ve come to Britain seeking sanctuary creates a climate where violence can flourish.\n\u201cOur frontline staff work in many of the communities affected and see that most people are fair-minded and compassionate. While they may have valid questions about why hotels are used, these concerns are being hijacked by a violent minority.\n\u201cAsylum hotels have become flashpoints \u2013 a symbol of a broken system that traps people in limbo, unable to work or rebuild their lives at huge public cost.\u201d"

Homan argued that such satire emboldens violence against ICE officers, citing a significant increase in assaults on them. The episode, titled 'Got a Nut,' depicted Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and criticized the administration's mass deportation efforts, while ICE recruitment has faced challenges amid public backlash and operational difficulties.",
