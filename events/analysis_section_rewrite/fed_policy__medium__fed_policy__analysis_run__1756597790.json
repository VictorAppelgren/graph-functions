      "feedback": "The draft is solid in scope, mapping to the canonical DXY handle, providing a 3‑6‑month horizon, a clear catalyst window (CPI release, Fed meetings, tariff announcements), and a coherent risk‑reward narrative. However, the quantitative projections (DXY +0.4 % over 3‑6 mo, ±0.3 % / mo volatility, and a –0.2 % alternative) are not sourced in the article and therefore violate the “truth > verbosity” rule. **Action:** either (a) remove the specific numbers and replace them with a qualitative statement (“DXY likely to remain in a modest upside bias”), or (b) flag them as assumptions and cite a relevant data source (e.g., recent DXY trend or Fed policy outlook). Ensure every claim—especially the magnitude ranges—has an inline citation or explicit assumption. All other sentences are on‑target and well‑cited.",
