  "description": "Founded by a 20-year-old and two 22-year-olds, Human Behaviour uses vision AI to give companies a real understanding of how people use their products.",
  "content": "Amogh Chaturvedi is running on little sleep but plenty of conviction at 6 a.m. He\u2019s groggy, apologetic for rescheduling, and still reeling from a recent scare involving a family member and an electric scooter.\n\nWithin minutes, though, the 20-year-old Stanford dropout snaps into focus, walking me through how he and his co-founders sold one startup at 19, landed in Y Combinator, and raised $5 million for their next company, Human Behavior.\n\nLaunched just a few months ago, Human Behaviour is betting that vision AI can do what analytics tools like Mixpanel and PostHog have struggled with: give companies a real understanding of how people use their products, including why they convert or churn.\n\nInstead of relying on manually tagged events or clickstream data, Human Behavior claims its AI watches real user session replays and generates insights, answering product teams\u2019 most pressing questions without hours of instrumenting code.\n\nThe four-month-old YC startup closed its $5 million seed round in just two days (which is becoming a norm for current YC companies), with backers including General Catalyst, Paul Graham, Vercel Ventures, and Y Combinator.\n\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve done the financial engineering game because we got more offers with higher valuations, but we didn\u2019t want that,\u201d said the CEO.\n\nChaturvedi met his co-founders, Skyler Ji and Chirag Kawediya, both 22, at a hacker house he organized in 2023 as an excuse to live and build with friends after his freshman year at Stanford.\n\nTheir first startup, Dough, was an e-commerce accounting tool they bootstrapped. Like Chaturvedi, Ji dropped out of college (leaving Berkeley) while Kawediya went on to graduate.\n\nAlthough YC was initially skeptical about Dough\u2019s market potential, the team was admitted into the accelerator\u2019s spring batch this year on the assumption they would eventually pivot, Chaturvedi says. They did so almost immediately, after speaking with every customer and inquiring about any other problems they faced.\n\nThe feedback was consistent: while Dough could show which products were selling or not, the customers wanted to know why. Answering that required analytics powered by behavioral data, not just accounting reports.\n\nWith this new direction, the team sold Dough for six figures to Employer.com, the same company that bought Bench, and went all-in on Human Behavior.\n\nKawediya explains that companies using traditional analytics often need engineers to set up event trackers for every button and click, burning hours, sometimes weeks, of engineering time.\n\nFor a fast-moving startup, that\u2019s far from ideal. \u201cEven once you have that data, you\u2019re still stuck with the bigger question of how users actually interact with your product so you can make it better,\u201d he says.\n\nSession replays aren\u2019t new, but until recently, computer vision models weren\u2019t accurate enough to parse them at scale. Now they are, and Human Behaviour is doing so to summarize and segment thousands of hours of footage. \u201cWhy spend hours writing code to track clicks when we can just watch the video?\u201d Ji adds.\n\nToday, Human Behaviour\u2019s customers \u2014 mostly fast-moving Series A and B startups \u2014 get daily summary emails highlighting which features were used, which bugs appeared, and which users churned. Since launching four months ago, Chaturvedi says the company has been growing 20% month-over-month.\n\nThe founders call session replays an \u201cuntapped goldmine.\u201d Right now, Human Behavior helps teams understand users and squash bugs. Over time, the same dataset could power automated QA and embedded IT support. Their ambition is to make Human Behavior the Datadog of session replay, spinning out dozens of products from the same core data.\n\nBuilding with new technology from the ground up is how the founders believe they\u2019ll take on more established players like Mixpanel and PostHog. \u201cFor some of these companies, it might be difficult to replicate what we have because their architecture can\u2019t support the shift without starting over,\u201d remarked Chaturvedi.",

      "text": "Bench, the VC-backed accounting startup that left thousands of customers locked out of their accounts after it suddenly shut down last week, will be acquired by Employer.com for an undisclosed price in a last-minute deal, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\nThe San Francisco-based HR tech company Employer.com focuses on payroll and onboarding, in contrast to Bench, which specializes in accounting and tax. Employer.com\u2019s chief marketing officer Matt Charney told TechCrunch the company will revive Bench\u2019s platform and provide instructions for customers to log in and obtain their data.\nCustomers will be given the choice to port their data or keep their service under new ownership, Charney told TechCrunch. Bench\u2019s previous recommendation to file for a six-month extension with the Internal Revenue Service to look for a new bookkeeper is no longer needed if customers decide to stay on, Employer.com confirmed.\nBench\u2019s website, which is still offline at the time of writing, previously touted more than 35,000 \u201cAmerican small business owners\u201d on its platform, according to an archived copy. (Post-publication, Employer.com told TechCrunch that Bench has approximately 12,000 customers.) Bench\u2019s website currently reads: \u201cMore information on how to continue your services will be available soon.\u201d The startup\u2019s abrupt shutdown on Friday caused chaos, with customers finding themselves locked out of their accounts right as tax season is set to begin, and emails from TechCrunch to Bench employees bouncing back.\nTechCrunch confirmed the acquisition with a Bench board member. Neither Bench nor Employer.com would comment on the acquisition price.\nEmployer.com is a new company: Its CEO, Jesse Tinsley, announced his acquisition of the domain name in November for about $450,000. Tinsley is behind a host of HR, onboarding, and recruiting-related businesses, including Recruiter.com and BountyJobs. In a post on December 11, Tinsley said that the company is \u201cstill acquiring companies\u201d in the HR space. Employer.com is not VC-backed and is entirely self-funded, Charney told TechCrunch.\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Employer.com said Bench customers can expect to continue \u201cworking with the same expert in-house bookkeepers they know and trust.\u201d\n\u201cThis acquisition ensures that Bench customers can continue relying on the same high-quality service they\u2019ve always received, while also opening the door to future enhancements and capabilities powered by Employer.com\u2019s extensive resources,\u201d Employer.com\u2019s statement said.\nThat may be tricky in practice. Bench employed more than 600 people, according to its website, some of whom posted on LinkedIn after the shutdown notice that they were now looking for work. Bench is now starting to call \u201cmany\u201d \u2014 but not all \u2014 of its employees back to work to ensure continuity, Jennifer Bouyoukos, Bench\u2019s chief people officer, told TechCrunch.\nTechCrunch archived Bench\u2019s original shutdown notice from December 27 below:"

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.
