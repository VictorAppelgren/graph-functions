      "feedback": "This draft has solid empirical hooks (Pottery Barn’s 20% Labor Day markdown to 2,235 for the Indio Eucalyptus sectional with other promos such as HexClad up to 44% and Saatva up to $400 off; Shopify’s Q2 results showing GMV up 27% and revenue up 29% with a 70x forward P/E and 18x P/S) but it fails to deliver a clean, 0–3 week horizon thesis and a tight causal chain; to reach world‑class, rewrite as a single, structured forecast: (1) drop irrelevant tail risks (the Moscow blast and Malik Beasley saga) unless you frame them as macro risk signals; (2) state an explicit 0–3 week hypothesis: Labor Day promo breadth and back‑to‑school demand lift consumer‑discretionary/household durables, with promo breadth metrics to watch (e.g., broad markdowns across furniture, appliances, cookware as flagged by 6U8VYS7BA and  XB5ZRN1VP); (3) quantify catalysts and triggers with concrete thresholds: e.g., if Labor Day markdown breadth broadens to 3+ categories at top retailers and promo depth exceeds ~25–30% across 2–3 weeks (per 6U8VYS7BA,  XB5ZRN1VP), expect near‑term upside in consumer names; if Shopify GMV growth sustains ~27–29% and revenue growth ~29% with no material profit deterioration, the stock could remain supported despite high multiples (19NO2GMNF, QGXA2WQJ3); (4) define invalidation points and risk: a sustained slowdown in discretionary spend or a reversal in GMV momentum intermediate to earnings would prompt volatility and potential multiple compression; (5) articulate what “reaction function” to model: near‑term beta to consumer/tech gear, with explicit price/return sensitivities and a dashboard of next data points (promo breadth, GMV, revenue, operating income, and macro consumer indicators); (6) tighten internal consistency: anchor every claim to an ID from SOURCE MATERIAL (6U8VYS7BA, XB5ZRN1VP, NBX9RA9WX, 19NO2GMNF, QGXA2WQJ3, QGXA2WQJ3, NBX9RA9WX) and remove duplicative or non‑integrated sources; (7) add a crisp “key levels/monitoring” box embedded in the paragraph (e.g., watch 20–30% promo breadth, GMV growth staying above 25%‑30%, Shopify forward multiples vs growth trajectory); and (8) deliver a compact, cohesive causal chain: Labor Day promotions lift discretionary spend → retailer promo breadth feeds inventory clearance and merchant GMV signals (6U8VYS7BA, XB5ZRN1VP) → Shopify’s GMV momentum sustains top‑line growth but valuation remains premium (19NO2GMNF, QGXA2WQJ3) → near‑term price action hinges on the durability of growth vs multiple compression, with clear invalidation if promo breadth fades or GMV slows; all of which should be distilled into a single, well‑marked forecast paragraph with minimal extraneous risk items.",
