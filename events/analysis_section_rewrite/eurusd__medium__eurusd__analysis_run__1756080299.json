      "feedback": "This draft is a solid starting point but needs a tighter, fully scaffolded 3–6 month catalyst map, explicit timing windows, and tighter first‑principles logic. Actionable edits: (1) Build a formal catalysts map with clearly labeled triggers and invalidation rules, drawing directly from the sources: tariff escalation (base 10% rising to 15% for a large tranche and up to 40% for others; 25% on cars and 25% on steel/aluminum as described in 9JYRMPXB0; broader tariff framing and near‑term payoff signals in 1443EJVX4/USA Today pieces), labor/growth signals (July payrolls 73k, unemployment ~4.2%, Black unemployment 7.2% in 1443EJVX4), Fed reaction (September cut odds around 45% and inflation guardrails in 1443EJVX4), geopolitics (Greenland/Panama contingency risk in W3CN6QOQR), cross‑border/sovereignty friction with Mexico (Sheinbaum stance in 4693XL4AP), and domestic policy/regulatory risk (DOGE, religious accommodations and federal workforce actions in N9A7MEOD2 and related Fox items). Each catalyst should have an explicit invalidation condition (e.g., a Supreme Court decision halting EO‑driven reforms; a court ruling blocking tariff changes; a credible drop‑in‑inflation path that relieves Fed pressure). (2) Quantify and anchor numbers with precise ranges and dates from the sources: tariffs path (10% base, 15% for broad tranche, up to 40% for others; 25% on cars/steel/aluminum per 9JYRMPXB0; potential $7T in new plants/capital flows cited in 9JYRMPXB0; 73k July payrolls and 4.2% unemployment; Black unemployment 7.2% in 1443EJVX4), Fed timing (September cut odds ~45%), and notable corporate investment signals (Apple/large cap investment cited in 9JYRMPXB0). (3) Rebuild the scenario structure with explicit 3–6 month sequencing: a base case with gradual tariff tightening and a cautious Fed stance; Alt 1 with faster tariff escalation and hotter inflation; Alt 2 with geopolitical de‑escalation (Mexico/Greenland risk fading) and a softer risk‑off environment. Attach timing windows (e.g., Week 0–4 tariff announcements; Week 4–8 Fed commentary; Week 8–16 cross‑border dynamics; Week 16–26 policy signals and earnings/consumption data). (4) Strengthen the causal chain with first‑principles economics: how tariffs raise import prices and pass‑through to CPI, how labor‑market weakness feeds into rate expectations, and how cross‑border sovereignty risks alter trade/investment flows. (5) Align with SECTION FOCUS by ending with a base case, 1–2 clearly defined alts, explicit risks, and a watch‑list of signals with threshold triggers; provide a confidence label (e.g., moderate) tied to the strength and concordance of the cited sources. (6) Reconcile conflicts and improve citation discipline: whenever a data point or claim is used, append the relevant IDs (9JYRMPXB0, 1443EJVX4, W3CN6QOQR, 4693XL4AP, N9A7MEOD2) and, where sources disagree, present both angles with their source backing and a clearly stated assumption; explicitly show how conflicting signals (e.g., Trump’s rhetoric vs. court‑level realities) are treated in the model. (7) Clean up the prose to remove ambiguity (e.g., avoid conflating Apple’s stated investment level across quotes; note whether figures come from 9JYRMPXB0 or adjacent text). Adopting these edits will elevate depth, provide a reproducible 3–6 month framework, integrate macro/policy/flows/valuation with transparent triggers, and improve attribution consistency across the cited source IDs.",
