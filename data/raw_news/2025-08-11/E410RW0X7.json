  "description": "It just got a lot easier.",
  "content": "A lot of AI features are pretty unnecessary and sometimes invasive. But many can actually be genuinely useful. Many of Copilot's features are regarded by many as gimmicks, but one of the most useful ones just got a lot easier to access.\n\nExcel is rolling out a brand-new (or kind of new) feature called Explain Formula. This new feature embeds an AI-powered explanation tool directly into the Excel grid, which is always accessible via a right click. Previously, if you encountered a complicated or unfamiliar formula, you would need to either manually dissect it, consult external documentation, or use a separate help pane. Or, God forbid, Google it. The \"Explain Formula\" feature makes this easier by providing a step-by-step breakdown of what a formula does, right next to the selected cell.\n\nThis is pretty useful because the contextual nature of the explanations. It doesn't just give you a regular explanation of what a formula is doing or how it's working. Copilot, which is of course the chatbot that's powering this, analyzes the specific formula in its actual use case, referencing the cells and data ranges involved in the calculation. This way, you can see what the formula is doing using the data that's present in the sheet.\n\nWhen you select a cell containing a formula, all you need to do is right-click on the cell and choose the \"Explain this formula\" option. From there, a pop-up window will show up, analyzing the formula and giving you a rundown on what it's doing and how it's working. However, if the main Copilot chat pane is already open, the explanation will be rendered there instead to maintain a consistent user interface. For those who wish to explore the formula further or ask follow-up questions, an option to \"Chat with Copilot\" is available, which transitions the conversation to the more extensive side pane for a deeper dialogue.\n\nThis isn't exactly a new feature. By using the Copilot side pane, you could always ask it questions about the entire sheet, including explaining a formula if you wish to do so. This, however, makes it way easier, even if you don't frequently use said Copilot side panel\u2014I personally always close it when I'm not using it, and if I need this feature, it's way easier to right click and select a button within a menu than opening the side panel up again and manually type out my request.\n\nIf you want to check this out, Microsoft says this is slowly rolling out to everyone, so keep an eye out for an update coming soon.",

      "text": "Understanding complex formulas in Excel just got a lot easier. The new Explain Formula feature turns Copilot into your inline assistant, delivering clear, step-by-step breakdowns directly on the grid, right next to your data, no need to switch context or open the chat pane.\nWhat makes this especially powerful is that the explanations are contextual, grounded in your actual data and workbook, not generic descriptions.\nBy bringing the explanation to where you\u2019re working, Copilot helps you stay in flow. It\u2019s a seamless, in-the-moment experience that makes it easy to scan, understand, and act on formulas right where you need it most.\nHow It Works\nHere\u2019s how to get an explanation in just a few clicks:\n- Select a cell with a valid formula\n- A Copilot icon appears next to the cell\n- Click \u201cExplain this formula\u201d from the dropdown\n- Copilot shows a step-by-step explanation directly on the grid\n- Need to dive deeper? Click \u201cChat with Copilot\u201d to continue the conversation in the side pane\nNote: If the Copilot chat pane is already open, the explanation will be displayed there instead of on the grid.\nWhat It Does: Contextual Formula Explanations\nWhen you select a formula cell, Copilot can now explain what that formula does using a dedicated card shown in the grid. Helping you quickly understand what the formula does based on your actual data and context, not just a generic description.\nThis makes it easy to:\n\u2705 Understand the formula\u2019s goal in your workbook\n\u2705 Learn how it works, function by function\n\u2705 Build confidence without ever leaving your sheet\nFor example, given this formula:\n=I4 * XLOOKUP(H4, $L$4:$L$7, $M$4:$M$7)\nWith just a click, Copilot will explain that:\nBecause the explanation is tailored to your actual data and scenario, it\u2019s faster to grasp, easier to verify, and more relevant to your work. Copilot provides the clarity you need right where you need it.\nCopilot Can Explain Any Excel formula\nNo matter how simple or complex, Copilot can explain any Excel formula. Whether you're working with math, logic, references, arrays, or text manipulation, Copilot helps you understand what\u2019s going on and why.\nAvailability\nThis feature is gradually rolling out to Excel for Windows and Excel for the web.\nFeedback\nWe\u2019d love to hear how this new experience is working for you.\nLet us know:\n\u2714\ufe0f Was the explanation clear and easy to understand?\n\u2714\ufe0f Was it easy to access the explanation when you needed it?\n\u2714\ufe0f Did the overall experience feel intuitive and helpful?\nJust click the \ud83d\udc4d or \ud83d\udc4e at the bottom of the Copilot response to share your thoughts.\nYour feedback helps us refine the experience and prioritize what\u2019s next."
