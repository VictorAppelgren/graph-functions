  "description": "When temps are high, this low-tech accessory delivers.",
  "content": "Every time my grandmother parked the car, that accordion-style sun shade came out like clockwork. She unfurled and stretched it across the windshield of her black 1988 Ford Tempo. That simple device was a lifesaver on those hot, bright days when the stifling air inside her parked car could rise to 120 degrees after an hour. As low-tech as it seemed back then, that metallic sunshade did the trick by reflecting enough sunlight to keep the interior noticeably cooler. That was 30 years ago, and sun shades are still a popular and affordable auto accessory today.\n\nBack in 1991, the Los Angeles Times ran an article about Israeli inventor Abraham Levy who created the modern accordion-style windshield shade in 1972 in Israel. Having had a tough time convincing many people that his new device was worth a second look, it took most of the decade to catch on with the public. Then in 1980, he patented CarCool here in the United States. Imitators saw a savvy idea and sprang to action, flooding the market with their own copies.\n\nWith windshield sun shades as widely available as they are now, I wanted to know how well they work. I was sure they would reduce a car\u2019s interior temperature compared to being unshaded, but by how much? Would it be enough of a difference to be worth the slight hassle of driving around with a sun shade folded up in the back seat, or had my childhood memories of that cooler Ford Tempo interior been deceiving me all along?\n\n\n\nAvailable in a wide variety of designs, including accordion, umbrella and folding, a sun shade not only keeps your car\u2018s interior cooler in summer, but can help prevent UV exposure and potential damage to your vehicle\u2019s interior, seats, dashboard, and electronics. There are universal and custom-fit types, and many feature a foam core that can insulate, too, to keep your car\u2019s interior warmer in winter months.\n\nI\u2019ve been an automotive journalist for 15 years, and I\u2019ve spent the entirety of that time living on the East Coast. First, in North Carolina, where the temperatures by July and August would tickle the triple-digit marker on the thermometer. Later, I moved to New York and seemed to bring the stifling-hot weather with me. Temperatures in the high 90s became more common here, too. If that isn\u2019t enough, I regularly test cars and take hiking trips in the Southwestern deserts, coupled with the fact that I prefer black cars and leather interiors. All to say, I know the sting of sliding into a burning-hot car\u2019s interior way too well.\n\nHow Does a Sun Shade Work? We Tested to Find Out.\n\nEver stand in the shade of a tree, awning, or building on a sweltering day to cool down? Being out of the sun\u2019s direct rays reduces heat absorbed through radiation. Your body heats up less in the shade than if you were standing out in the open absorbing the full blast of the sun\u2019s rays. Your car benefits in the same way from having shade.\n\nA car sun shade placed in the windshield relies on a shiny, reflective silver foil surface that faces outward from the car. When sun hits, the light bounces back, thereby preventing it from reaching the car\u2019s interior. Without that shade, the surfaces would absorb the sunlight in the form of radiation heat, which then would warm up the air inside the car via convection heat, like an oven. Even without a reflective surface, but instead a dark one, a sun shade will still absorb some of the sun\u2019s energy, which helps to reduce temperature rising inside the vehicle.\n\nThe second way a sun shade prevents a car\u2019s interior from heating up involves the layer of foam insulation between the shiny, outer-facing foil layer and the inner-facing layer. Not every sun shade has this layer, but most do. The principle behind it is this: Air is an awful conductor of heat. For instance, anytime you put another blanket on your bed or wear a heavy coat, you\u2019re using that to your advantage. The trapped air between the fabric fibers or goose down fluff slows down your body\u2019s loss of heat to your cold surroundings because the heat gets trapped in those many tiny pockets of air.\n\nThe same applies with the insulating foam middle layer in a sun shade, only in this case it works to keep your car\u2019s interior cool. The shiny, foil side reflects and blocks a lot of the sun\u2019s heat, but there\u2019s residual heat that warms the sun shade itself. The foam layer keeps the sun shade\u2019s warmth from reaching the car\u2019s interior by trapping this residual heat within the tiny pockets of air.\n\nThe cooling effect provided by a sun shade can be remarkable. To test this, I dragged my old car into the sun to evaluate. My vehicle is a black 1984 Mazda RX-7 with burgundy leather interior. This old sports car, with its steeply raked windshield, is basically all glass from the hip up. Translation: it has a long history of roasting me to death like a Thanksgiving turkey because it\u2019s basically a greenhouse.\n\nTo take full advantage of the heat wave that was crushing the East Coast earlier this summer, I propped up an accordion-style sun shade over the dashboard and used a handheld thermometer to see how hot the interior got with and without a sun shade after 90 minutes parked in the mid-day sun.\n\nBecause there isn\u2019t custom-fit sun shade available for this older car, I had to use a sun shade that wasn\u2019t a perfect fit. Over the course of a week, I took advantage of four sunny days to capture temperature readings with the understanding that several variables were at play: ambient temperature, sun exposure, cloud cover, time of day, the angle at which the car is parked, and the car itself\u2014 a laboratory test in a controlled environment, this was not. Still, the results were consistent in real-world testing.\n\nThe benefits of the sun shade were apparent quickly. After 30 minutes, the car with the sun shade was 10 degrees cooler than it was without the sun shade. That\u2019s a temperature difference you\u2019d notice when opening the door and plopping onto the seat. After an hour, the car\u2019s interior temperature with the sun shade topped 90 degrees. That\u2019s still hot, but a noticeable improvement over the unshaded interior measurements that hit close to 120 degrees at the one-hour mark and continued to climb a few degrees toward 125 degrees over the following 30 minutes.\n\nLater, I came back for further evaluation, but this time using a silver 2011 Hyundai Accent with cloth seats for another test case. Given the Hyundai\u2019s larger interior, with five seats, I wondered if it might be harder to cool down than the smaller, two-seater Mazda, but the level of cooling that the sun shade provided was about the same for each of the two cars.\n\nHow to Use a Sun Shade Correctly\n\nUnfolding, opening, or unrolling one of these won\u2019t require a master\u2019s degree. They\u2019re simple to use, but make sure to unfurl it while you and it are both inside the car; otherwise, it\u2019s going to be unnecessarily hard to fit it through the car\u2019s door. Locate the cut-out for the rear-view mirror and check that you\u2019ve got the shade oriented with the cut-out at the top. Point the shade\u2019s shiny side facing outward and then place it flat against the windshield. Plenty of sun shades have shiny foil on both sides. If so with yours, it won\u2019t matter which side points outward.\n\nHold the shade in place with one hand while you flip down both sun visors to secure the sun shade in place. Many car sun shades can be purchased as custom-fit to your make and model, but universal ones in a rectangular design will fit most vehicles\u2019 windshields. If you do go for a one-size-fits-all sun shade, keep in mind you may have to tweak the fitment by folding back the shade\u2019s edges to fit your car\u2019s windshield. On the Accent, a subcompact car, I had to do exactly that, whereas I\u2019d expect that the same sun shade could be spread out in all its unconstrained glory across the cavernous windshield of a Ford F-150.\n\nWhat to Look for in a Car Sun Shade\n\nAccordion-style folding sun shades tend to be quicker and easier to use than the other styles, and if your sunshade is quicker and easier to use\u2014even slightly more\u2014then you\u2019re more likely to use it. There\u2019s no fighting with stubborn suction cups or finicky umbrella-style sun shades, nor are there any delicate parts to break. An accordion sun shade can be easily stowed in a backseat pocket, under the front passenger seat, or even the trunk of your vehicle.\n\nBack in the \u201890s, I remember windshield sunshades as being one-size-fits-all. You\u2019d just stretch the big rectangle across your windshield. It\u2019d mostly fit. There might be some light leakage around the edges, but it was good enough back then. Now, most sunshades are custom fit to your car\u2019s windshield but will likely cost more than a universal one.\n\nAll the sun shades I know of are some combination of black, gray, and silver. Some sunshades come with a black side opposite the foil. These are meant for all-seasons use: simply turn the shade inside out during cold months. During winter, for example, face the black side of the sunshade outward and the foil side inward. Rather than reflect the sun\u2019s heat, the black side absorbs it, warming the car\u2019s interior.\n\nGood news for those already overwhelmed by the maintenance needs of owning an automobile. There\u2019s barely any upkeep or cleaning required for a sun shade. Theoretically a dirty sunshade will reflect less sun, reducing its performance not to mention it\u2019ll look grungy. If yours needs a cleaning, wipe it down with a damp paper towel. That\u2019s it.\n\nWhy do you only cover windshield sun shades?\n\nWindshields are angled more steeply than other windows in your vehicle in order to cut down on the car\u2019s wind resistance, and so they allow lots of sunlight to pass into the interior when the sun is more directly overhead during the hottest parts of the day. The steeper the pane of glass, such as the rear window on an SUV, the more the roof tends to block overhead sunlight.\n\nSome brands do offer shades for rear and side windows. These block additional sun, protect your vehicle\u2019s seating and interior in the back, and provide privacy.\n\nIn short, yes. If you\u2019ve parked your car around noon and the sun is directly overhead, it doesn\u2019t won't matter which way your car is facing while you\u2019re in the store or restaurant. Neither does it matter if your car won\u2019t move all day, such as if you\u2019re at work. But if you\u2019re dashing into the movie theater for a matinee and the sun is at an angle, try to park so that your windshield is facing the direction of the sun. That way the sun shade can block it head on, rather than letting that sneaky sun try to toast your car through its side or rear windows.\n\nWhen should I use a non-accordion-style sun shade?\n\nEven vehicles with steep windshields have enough of a dashboard to prop up an accordion-style sun shade. My 1999 Jeep Wrangler has the aerodynamics of a church with a windshield modeled after the broad side of a barn, and even that has enough of a dashboard to prop up a folding sun shade. I just haven\u2019t found a situation in which I\u2019d rather fiddle with an annoying suction cup-style model. For side windows and the steep rear windows of pickups and SUVs, however, I\u2019d use suction cup shades in those. But here we\u2019re talking about windshield shades, and so I\u2019d pass.\n\nUmbrella-style sun shades? I\u2019m not a fan of how finicky and delicate they are. Just think of the last time you opened an umbrella. An umbrella-style sun shade won\u2019t be fighting wind, but there are still lots of little parts to break compared to an accordion-style sun shade. The only time I\u2019d consider an umbrella design would be if I was driving a two-seater with no interior cargo space. Think Mazda MX-5 Miata or Chevrolet Corvette convertible. Even if the trunk were available, I\u2019d reserve that for cargo and use an umbrella-style shade that I could tuck away somewhere in the interior.\n\nThis premium design strikes a balance between features and cost. Nobody wants to overspend for a sunshade, but most would still appreciate a well-fitting sun shade sized to perfectly fit their car\u2019s windshield that leaves no gaps around the edges. This sun shade has a felt-covered interior side that prevents scratches to the dashboard. That\u2019s especially handy on smooth plastic interior surfaces, which are more scratch prone if you happen to catch a piece of dirt or grit between an uncoated sunshade and the dash.\n\nBecause this sun shade consists of two nearly (but not exactly) square pieces, you can rotate them longer side up for taller windshields. There aren\u2019t many light passenger vehicles on the market with windshields 62 inches or wider, which would be the width of the two shades next to each other and not overlapping, so they\u2019ll fit just about any car, light truck, or SUV available now. If you\u2019re looking for a sun shade for a larger commercial vehicle or an RV, you\u2019ll have to keep looking.\n\nThe WeatherTech Sun Shade\u2019s roll-up storage design is not as rigid as an accordion-style sun shade, but sturdy, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it falling down once it\u2019s unfurled across your dashboard. Its foam core provides insulation between the sun and the car\u2019s interior. Rather than toss the WeatherTech into storage during the winter, just flip it around, with the black side facing out, and it\u2019ll absorb sunlight to warm your car\u2019s cold interior.",

      "text": "Inventor Cashes In on a Hot Market by Helping Keep Millions of Cars Cool\n- Share via\nThousand Oaks businessman Abraham Levy is hardly famous, but his creation may be as familiar to Southern California drivers as scorching hot seats and sun-cracked dashboards.\nAbout 18 years ago, Levy created a folding cardboard sun shield that millions use today to keep dashboards and car seats from getting too hot. He calls it CarCool, and like a father, he is deeply attached to his creation.\n\u201cEvery father is proud of his children, and every inventor is proud of his invention,\u201d the silver-haired, 63-year-old inventor said.\nSitting in his office surrounded by large photographs of the shade, Levy has good reason to be proud. Royalties and licensing fees he gets from other companies that manufacture and distribute the shade have made him a millionaire. Although he declines to reveal his income, the car shade has spawned a $300-million industry since he began marketing the invention in the early 1980s.\nLevy has seen then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger use his car shade on visits he made to Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.\nHe estimates that fewer than half of the shades are used just for protecting cars. The rest are also used for advertising purposes, imprinted usually with the names and logos of large companies such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola. About half of U. S. car owners today own a car shade, he said.\nBut the popular car shade has been a magnet for bootleggers.\nSince acquiring the U. S. patent 11 years ago, Levy has spent $2.5 million on 30 lawsuits against those who pirate his design.\nIn all cases, the defendants settled out of court and agreed to pay the roughly 10- to 15-cent royalty Levy demands. Only last year, he won a $250,000 judgment from L & M Enterprises of Phoenix, Ariz.\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for blood,\u201d said Levy. \u201cI call them shoplifters. They try to steal my idea.\u201d\nAnother company, Empire Container of Carson, settled in 1987, but ceased manufacturing the car shade instead of paying Levy royalties, said owner Lewis Eagle.\nEagle still contends that the car-shade design is not a novel idea and that Levy does not deserve the patent. Similar accordion-like pieces of cardboard have been widely used in the packaging industry since the 1960s, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea, but it\u2019s not an invention,\u201d Eagle said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s like holding a patent on a corrugated box--it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\nLevy discovers imitations when distributors pass along samples missing his patent number and the CarCool name. That discovery is usually followed immediately by a lawsuit.\nLevy\u2019s expensive legal battles are not unusual among inventors, said Margaret Morrell, deputy director of the International Anticounterfeiting Coalition in Washington.\nA survey last year of the group\u2019s 120 members indicated that they spend an average of 70% of their gross sales revenues in legal fees and expenses, and that the average lawsuit took about 1 1/2 years to resolve.\nLevy said he invested years of research and almost went broke marketing the shield.\nIronically, the source of Levy\u2019s invention was the scorching Israeli desert, not California sunshine. Levy found himself fashioning makeshift sun shades to insulate his car from the 100-degree heat.\n\u201cI hated to go into my hot car. I was using anything that was handy,\u201d he said. \u201cOriginally. I was thinking of making something for my own car, and then I thought, why not make it for everybody?\u201d\nLevy experimented with hinged devices made out of plywood, aluminum and Styrofoam before devising cardboard prototypes in the early 1970s.\nNobody would accept the first shields. He hired out-of-work students to hawk them at beaches and parking lots, but there were no takers. Then during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Levy donated thousands of shades to the Israeli government for use on military vehicles.\nHe received a thank-you letter, but no sales materialized.\nFinally in 1977, a newspaper called Haaretz decided to offer the shields as an advertising promotion to sell classified ads. The promotion worked and Levy secured a patent soon after.\nIn 1980, Levy received his first U. S. patent for the CarCool shade. He moved his headquarters to the Conejo Valley in 1986. Today Levy has licensed 350 manufacturers to produce the shades. He still gives sun shields away, but not to promote sales.\nIn January, Levy received thank-you letters from President George Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney after he donated 35,000 folding shades to U. S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia. The shades were used on jeeps, trucks, personnel carriers, helicopters and jet fighters.\nSales remain brisk, and he estimates that 100 million shades have been sold nationwide since they became popular in the mid-1980s. Today, with millions of shades already in use, the price has declined from the original $5. They now retail for $2 to $4. He recently won another patent for a car shield with handles that can also double as a sign.\nAlways the visionary, Levy is now exploring ways to soothe motorists who become frazzled in heavy traffic.\n\u201cThe car population is exploding all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I think people need now is something to take out all that tension when they drive.\u201d"
