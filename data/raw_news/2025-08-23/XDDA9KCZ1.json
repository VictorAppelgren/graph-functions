  "title": "Chicago officials react to Trump National Guard threat\u2014'Trying to distract'",
  "description": "Trump said on Friday that Chicago will \"probably\" be the next city to which the administration will deploy federal troops, officers and agents.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nChicago officials are pushing back against President Donald Trump's threat to deploy the National Guard to the city, dismissing the move as a political ploy.\n\nTrump said on Friday that Chicago will \"probably\" be the next city to which the administration will deploy federal troops, officers and agents.\n\n\"Chicago's a mess, you have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent,\" Trump said from the Oval Office.\n\n\"We'll straighten that one out, probably next, that will be our next one after this. I think Chicago will be our next and then we'll help with New York.\"\n\nIt comes after Trump said he would do the same in Washington, D.C. Trump has repeatedly described some of the nation's largest cities, run by Democrats, with Black mayors and majority-minority populations, as dangerous and filthy.\n\nTrump announced earlier this month that he was sending federal troops to Washington, D.C, after alleging that the nation's capital was \"overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.\"\n\nTrump's intervention marked an unprecedented federal crackdown in the local governance of the District of Columbia. The deployment of federal troops sparked widespread backlash over constitutional limits and home rule rights. Critics argue that it breaches democratic principles and could set a dangerous precedent, while supporters frame it as a necessary measure for public order.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nFollowing Trump's remarks, Chicago officials strongly condemned Trump's threat to send the National Guard to the city.\n\nIn a statement on X, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said Trump is \"attempting to create chaos that distracts from his problems,\" accusing him of trying to \"incite fear in our communities and destabilize existing public safety efforts.\"\n\nPritzker argued that \"Trump and Republicans are trying to distract from the pain they're causing\u2014from tariffs raising the prices of goods to stripping away health care and food from millions.\" He added that \"crime rates are improving. Homicides are down by more than 30 percent in Chicago in the last year alone,\" crediting local partnerships and community programs that \"they're defunding.\"\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city has \"not received any formal communication from the Trump administration regarding additional federal law enforcement or military deployments,\" but warned that \"unlawfully deploying the National Guard to Chicago has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement.\"\n\nJohnson argued that \"the problem with the President's approach is that it is uncoordinated, uncalled-for, and unsound,\" noting Chicago has already \"reduced homicides by more than 30 percent, robberies by 35 percent, and shootings by almost 40 percent.\" He added: \"The National Guard will not alleviate the housing crisis \u2026 will not put food in the stomachs of the 1 in 4 children that go to bed hungry \u2026 [and] is no substitute for dedicated local law enforcement and community violence interrupters.\"\n\nIt comes after Trump declared a \"crime emergency\" in Washington, D.C. in early August, and invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to seize control of the city's police force, placing the Police Department under federal authority for the first time in history.\n\nAlongside that move, Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 800 D.C. National Guard troops, bolstered by reinforcements from six Republican-led states and hundreds of federal agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In total, more than 2,000 federal and state forces are now on the ground in the nation's capital.\n\nTrump justified the takeover by citing rampant crime in the city, but official data contradicts the claim. Washington, D.C. has recorded a 26 percent drop in violent crime compared to last year, reaching a 30-year low. That has fueled criticism that the move was less about public safety and more about political power.\n\nIn Chicago, figures in the Chicago Police Department's July 2025 report quoted by Johnson above, shows homicides reached the lowest level since 2014, with 44 reported murders last month.\n\nOverall, Part I crimes\u2014including violent and property offenses\u2014dropped 14 percent year-to-date and 18 percent month-to-month. Robberies fell 36 percent in July and 34 percent year-to-date, with firearm-related robberies down 46 percent compared to July 2024. Motor vehicle thefts declined 21 percent this month and 27 percent year-to-date, while burglaries decreased 28 percent from July 2024. Vehicular hijackings dropped 49 percent year-to-date, with 293 incidents reported. Additionally, officers recovered 1,190 firearms in July, averaging 38 per day, bringing the year-to-date total to 6,704 firearms recovered.\n\nMayor Johnson attributes these positive trends to comprehensive community investment strategies, including youth employment programs, expanded access to mental health care, and housing initiatives.\n\nTrump has taken aim at Chicago for over a decade, including on the 2024 and 2016 presidential campaign trails. He has repeatedly compared the city to Afghanistan and, in 2017, threatened to send in federal officers due to gun violence in the city, despite historic declines in violent crime in recent years.\n\nIn July, the Trump administration cut more than half federal funding for gun violence prevention programs, totaling $158 million in grants, which affected cities like Chicago. The Justice Department also terminated 69 community violence intervention grants in April, part of a broader halt of 365 grants worth $811 million.\n\nThe Department of Justice official told Reuters that the agency canceled the grants because they \"no longer effectuate the program's goals or agency's priorities.\"\n\nMayor Johnson said that if Trump wants to make Chicago safer, he should restore $158 million he cut in violence-prevention programs for cities such as Chicago.\n\n\"There are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them,\" he said.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nTrump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, said in a Newsmax interview: \"Maybe we should roll out the tour to Portland, Seattle, the other craphole cities of the country.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, said in part: Chicago is \"a beautiful, vibrant city with people from all walks of life \u2026 These unprecedented threats from President Trump are nothing more than a power grab to distract from his disastrous policies.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTrump has not indicated for certain if or when he will send federal troops into other cities.",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nNational Guard troops in Washington, D.C., have been told they should prepare to carry weapons in the nation's capital despite previous assurances from officials that the troops would not be armed, according to a Saturday report by The Wall Street Journal.\nWhen reached for comment, the D.C. Army National Guard told Newsweek that \"Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training.\"\nThe Pentagon directed Newsweek to speak with the Washington Guard when reached by email for comment. Meanwhile, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office told Newsweek it had no comment at this time.\nWhy It Matters\nPresident Donald Trump ordered 800 National Guard troops to deploy to Washington, with the troops arriving on Tuesday. The deployment aims to combat crime in the city, even as crime rates have reached a 30-year low, marking one of the most aggressive federal interventions in local law enforcement in recent history.\nThe deployment has prompted strong backlash due to the fact the administration bypassed the city's elected leaders, who have variously described Trump's directive as \"unsettling,\" \"unprecedented\" and \"dangerous.\"\nWashington officials sued the administration to block the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), which prompted U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to issue a memo that leaves the current police chief in charge of the department but also directs the police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, the Associated Press reported.\nWhat To Know\nAdministration officials had previously said the National Guard would not carry weapons, and troops who have already made the rounds on patrol around the city have done so without carrying them.\nThe Journal, citing people familiar with the plan, reported on Saturday that those troops were told on Friday evening they should expect an order to carry weapons. As of Saturday afternoon, no formal order had been issued.\nA White House official told the Journal that additional troops may be called to D.C., and they may be armed, but they would not be making any arrests.\nThe Army had stressed the lack of weapons in a press release issued Thursday, writing that the troops were deployed to \"provide a visible presence in key public areas, serving as a visible crime deterrent.\"\n\"They will not arrest, search, or direct law enforcement,\" the Army wrote. \"While they will not conduct arrests, they have the authority to temporarily detain individuals to prevent imminent harm, ensuring that custody is promptly transferred to law enforcement authorities.\"\nMost notably, the Army wrote that the troops would be equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE), including body armor, and that \"weapons are available if needed but will remain in the armory,\" while noting that \"future requirements will be assessed and determined based on the evolving needs of the supported law enforcement agencies.\"\nThe shifting framework highlights the tension in the capital and the unease between the administration and local officials.\nBondi in her Friday notice wrote of the responses from Washington officials, saying that \"unfortunately, the D.C. Attorney General continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety in Washington, D.C.,\" in contrast to Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, \"who is dedicated to ensuring the safety of residents, workers, and visitors in Washington, D.C.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nA White House official told Newsweek: \"The National Guard is not making arrests at this time \u2013 they may be armed, consistent with their mission and training, to protect federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.\nCaptain Tinashe T. Machona, a spokesperson for the D.C. Army National Guard, told Newsweek in an email statement: \"Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training. Their presence is focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve. The DC National Guard remains committed to assisting the District of Columbia and serving its residents and visitors whenever called upon.\"\nU.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi on Friday wrote on X: \"I have just issued a new directive to Mayor Bowser requiring MPD to provide the services found necessary by my designee, DEA Administrator Terry Cole, to comply fully and completely with federal immigration law and authorities, regardless of any policies MPD might otherwise have.\"\n\"Unfortunately, the D.C. Attorney General continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety in Washington, DC. It is important to note that this same D.C.

Mayor Muriel Bowser in an open letter to city residents this week, in part: \"...Over the course of a week, the surge in federal law enforcement across D.C. has created waves of anxiety. I was born one year after Home Rule became law, and while our autonomy has been challenged before, our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now. My jobs are many right now. Part of my job is just managing us through this crisis and making sure that our government continues to operate in a way that makes DC residents proud.\"\n...In fact, this evening, I am pleased to be able to report that, after a day in court and in accordance with Home rule, Pamela Smith remains our Chief of Police, and command and control of our 3,100 men and women at the Metropolitan Police Department. I am incredibly proud of how the chief has handled this experience.\"\nShe concluded: \"...I know that if we keep sticking together, we will make it to the other side of this, we will make future generations of Washingtonians proud, we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy\u2014even when we don't have full access to it.\"\nUpdate 8/17/25, 10:56 a.m. ET: This articles has been updated with additional comment.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nPeter Aitken is a Newsweek Politics Editor based in New York.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson criticized the threat, citing recent crime reductions and community programs that have lowered homicides, robberies, and shootings. The statement follows Trump\u2019s earlier deployment of federal forces to Washington, D.C., which sparked legal challenges and accusations of overreach. Chicago leaders argue that federal intervention would not address housing, food insecurity, or the city\u2019s public safety needs, and they call for restoration of cut federal violence\u2011prevention funding instead.",
