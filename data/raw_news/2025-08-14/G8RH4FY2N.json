  "title": "Uncharted 4 and The Last of Us 2 dev's new Japan-based studio aims to make a multiplayer game with Naughty Dog-level cinematic action and a Breaking Bad-style story, and it's already playable",
  "description": "Former Naughty Dog game director Vinit Agarwal was inspired by FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki",
  "content": "The new studio founded by former Naughty Dog developers Vinit Agarwal and Joe Pettinati is aiming to blend Naughty Dog-level cinematic action and a Breaking Bad-influenced story into a multiplayer game.\n\nAfter leading development on the now-scrapped Last of Us Online, Agarwal left Naughty Dog earlier this year to pursue independent game development in Japan. Although Pettinati is still US-based, the duo are working together on their still unnamed studio's debut title.\n\nAll we've known about the game at this point is that it's multiplayer, and we still don't know much more today, but in an interview with Game Spark (via Automaton), Agarwal spared us a few bread crumbs on the basic ethos behind the game.\n\nAgarwal, via machine translation, said \"Naughty Dog has had a strong influence on us in terms of their approach worldview and story,\" and with this new game, \"it's important not just to create interesting gameplay, but to ensure that the story, action, worldview, and gameplay are all on the same level.\"\n\nSpecifically, Agarwal said \"we aim to bring the cinematic action familiar from our previous works to the multiplayer between players.\" He also labeled the game a \"triple-indie,\" with the story and gameplay being influenced by the developers' time at a AAA studio but with the \"fast-paced feel\" of an indie game.\n\nNotably, Agarwal said he moved to Japan because he's always had a deep respect for Japanese developers and what he called a \"strong 'vision',\" adding that he recently spoke to FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki and \"was reminded once again that I like the style of a director with a strong vision.\"\n\nAnother influence on Agarwal is Breaking Bad, which he said he likes because \"the story is deep and the characters' motivations are interesting.\"\n\n\"In other words, what I want to create is a game with deep characters and a story like 'Breaking Bad,' with a touch of the dark themes mixed with lighter aspects that are common in Japanese works,\" he said.\n\nAgarwal wasn't ready to share anything more about the game itself, but he did reveal that it's been in development for a few months and is \"already playable,\" with playtesting happening \"in the near future.\"\n\nWith so little to go on, it's hard to say what form will eventually materialize from Agarwal and Pettinati's new studio, but they definitely have the experience to back up their lofty ambitions. Agarwal spent a decade at Naughty Dog and went from junior designer to game director on The Last of Us Online, while Pettinati also spent 10 years at the studio, going from editor to creative director.\n\nIn the meantime, here are the best PS5 games you can play right now.",

      "text": "Best PS5 games: The 25 greatest PlayStation 5 games ranked\nFrom Death Stranding 2: On the Beach to Helldivers 2, here's the best PS5 games you need to play in 2025\nThe best PS5 games celebrate the standout experiences on Sony's console. We've seen so many new games for 2025 arrive in the first half of the year that's shaken up our ranking, from fantastic third-party additions like the latest co-op adventure from It Takes Two developer, Hazelight Studios, to PS5 exclusives like the long awaited Death Stranding sequel.\nHappily this list only promises to keep changing in the future, too, with a host of exciting upcoming PS5 games to look forward to throughout the rest of the year and beyond. With so many great adventures to choose from that have found a happy home on the PS5 and PS5 Pro - the latter of which has seen a lineup of notable PS5 Pro Enhanced games - we've put our heads together to bring you the very best PS5 games that you tuck into right now.\nFrom considering all of our PS5 reviews, to value for time and the fun factor of each game we've seen arrive, our list brings together the PS5 games that continue to be the most memorable for one reason or another. Oh, and if you're looking for more recommendations and you're happy to go back on generation, be sure to check out our pick of the best PS4 games (which you can comfortably also play on your current-gen machine). Without further ado, read on below as we shine a light on the best PS5 games around right now.\nThe best PS5 games to play in 2025, ranked\nDeveloper: Sandfall Interactive | Released: 2025 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nSandfall Interactive brings to life a unique adventure that's simultaneously succeeds at being a love letter to the JRPG genre, while making it's own distinct mark within its foundations. With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's take on a turn-based system, every battle you encounter in the world is rewarding to conquer, with action that feels as good as it looks on PS5.\n\"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an outstanding visionary debut from Sandfall Interactive, which isn't merely a love letter to JRPGs but builds on its traditions with a distinctly French identity, making for one of the most exciting and rewarding action and turn-based hybrid battle systems ever devised\", says Alan Wen, author of our Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review.\nBut what perhaps is one of Clair Obsur: Expedition 33's biggest strength is the high-stakes story that will draw out your emotions and tug at your heartstrings as you go up against difficult odds. With a unquiet concept driving the adventure forward, the JRPG influences can be felt, but it's own identity stands tall, and with PS5 Pro enhancements, it finds a happy home on both of Sony's consoles.\nDeveloper: Warhorse Studios | Released: 2025 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is further evidence that we're living through something of a golden age for RPGs. While Baldur's Gate 3 certainly set a new standard, the latest open-world game from developer Warhorse Studios shows there's still plenty of scope for experimentation. The scope of this adventure is vast, set in a beautifully-realized 15th century Bohemia with an almost overwhelming commitment to historical realism.\n\"Building upon its predecessor's commitment to historical realism, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is an absorbing RPG that immerses you in medieval life. If you have the patience to endure a willfully slow progression system, you'll be richly rewarded with heaps to do in 15th century Bohemia,\" says Alan Wen, author of our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.\nWhat's so interesting about Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the ways in which it is able to leverage its setting to deliver a truly absorbing RPG that's quite unlike anything else around right now \u2013 in a way, it always feels like a throwback to classics of the PS3 and Xbox 360 era. The open-ended quest design is phenomenal, so too is a skill system which rewards persistence and an outlay of inquisitive NPCs who help sell the entire fantasy.\nDeveloper: Capcom | Released: 2023 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nIt's actually quite difficult to pick the best fighting game for PS5. If you want arcade thrills then there's Mortal Kombat 1 just waiting to crush your ribcage. If you're looking for a great 3D brawler, then you needn't look much further than Tekken 8. The thing is, Street Fighter 6 isn't just a fantastic 2D fighting game, it also represents one of the best overall fighting game packages ever put forward.\n\"Street Fighter 6 offers the most flexible, versatile, and expressive combat seen in the series to date. With its fantastic suite of game modes and diverse character roster, Street Fighter 6 has something to offer every type of fighting game fan,\" says Andi Hamilton, author of our Street Fighter 6 review.\nWhat you'll find in Street Fighter 6 is a finely-tuned fighting game with an expressive single-player offering and a mass of modes for multiplayer bouts. Whether you're a hardcore fighting game player or a casual Street Fighter fan, there really is something for everyone in here. The combat system is approachable and flexible, its complexity revealing itself as you sink scores of hours into its action. There's real versatility at the heart of Street Fighter 6 that is worth celebrating.\nDeveloper: Polyphony Digital | Released: 2022 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nPlayStation has always positioned its first-party racing games as true system showcases, and that is of course true once again with Gran Turismo 7. It's an absolutely stunning simulation, a monstrously-sized package that'll let you indulge in your favorite vehicle classes and take them out on a vast array of lovingly rendered tracks. There's even a game mode which is designed to let you simply marvel at all of the cars you've collected in the intricate detail they are afforded, and even learn a little about each of their historic significance too.\n\"Gran Turismo 7 builds on everything that made GT Sport so good, and even captures what made the early franchise games so beloved to begin with. It's simply a stunning driving game and a superb showcase of the PS5,\" says Justin Towell, author of our Gran Turismo 7 review.\nWhich is all to say that Gran Turismo 7 is undoubtedly the best racing game on PS5. The game shines on its longer events, where weather conditions can drastically alter the composition of races in real-time, and accelerated day/night cycles shifting the mood of races entirely. The sheer scope of the career throughline, and suite of accompanying modes packaged into the game, make this one of the most expansive racing games PlayStation has ever published.\nDeveloper: Kojima Productions | Released: 2025 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach builds on the foundations laid down by 2019's Death Stranding to bring an expanded experience that puts greater emphasis on the action and worldbuilding, and the result is a more refined and more approachable adventure that makes its own mark. Once again leaning into its sci-fi strangeness, the cast of characters you meet as Sam are On the Beach's beating heart as you venture across Australia. The online community aspect is back in full force, too, with the sequel once again allowing you to set down structures that other players can make use of, which creates the sense that you're working towards something together.\n\"There's a lot less friction this time around, and the pacing is different, but I've come to appreciate how Death Stranding 2 stands apart while still being in conversation with Hideo Kojima's prior work, Metal Gear Solid,\" says Oscar Taylor-Kent, author of our Death Stranding 2 review.\nDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach will see you dealing with unexpected events, and explores the theme of connection in its unique paranormal world, which looks beautiful on Sony's console. The impressive performance of the sequel on PS5 and PS5 Pro really can't be overstated. With very fast loading times, incredibly smooth frame rates, and gorgeous graphics, it really is a game to behold, too.\nDeveloper: Geometric Interactive | Released: 2023 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nCocoon was in contention for our best game of 2023 award, and for good reason. Developer Geometric Interactive \u2013 a studio founded by former Playdead employees, of Limbo and Inside fame \u2013 has delivered one of the best puzzle games of the generation here. This top-down adventure is absolutely spellbinding, making you feel like a big-brain genius with astonishing ease. That's largely a result of how well Cocoon quietly teaches you the basics, giving you room to explore esoteric solutions to increasingly complex, conceptual puzzles.\n\"Cocoon's world-hopping puzzle design is smart, compelling, and effortlessly seamless. Together with a strange biomechanical world of rich environments and soundscapes, Geometric Interactive's mind-bending adventure is the best puzzle game of 2023,\" says Josh West, author of our Cocoon review.\nCocoon tasks you with weaving different worldstates together, hopping between them all to progress across a lush biomechanical tapestry. It really is an astoundingly smart video game, one which takes an ingeniously creative approach to problem solving. If you'd like to challenge your capacity for lateral thinking, and ability to find inventive solutions to layered problems, then you won't be disappointed by what you find in Cocoon.\nDeveloper: Hazelight Studios | Released: 2025 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nHazelight Studios has a reputation for building the best co-op games. From the prison break antics of A Way Out to the wild fun of It Takes Two, Hazelight makes video games that are only playable with two controllers to hand \u2013 and best enjoyed with players sitting beside one another on the couch. The studio's winning streak continues with Split Fiction, a luxurious adventure that tracks two writers thrown into their own fictional worlds.\n\"Split Fiction is another expertly crafted cooperative game from Hazelight that perfectly straddles two genres simultaneously and consistently introduces one good idea after another,\" says Sam Loveridge, author of our Split Fiction review.\nSplit Fiction is an exceptionally inventive, wildly entertaining co-op experience that never seems to tire as it throws out new ideas, systems, and mechanics between each of its levels. The variety on offer is outrageous, with Split Fiction leaping between fantasy and science-fiction settings with playful ease. Whether you're jumping in with a friend in-person or through online functionality, Split Fiction is essential.\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Quebec | Released: 2025 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nIf Assassin's Creed Origins was the beginning of Ubisoft's journey to reconfigure its long-running franchise into an action-RPG, then Assassin's Creed Shadows feels like the culmination of these efforts. What you'll find in this adventure is a lushly presented open-world, both sprawling in its scope and absolutely beautiful to beyond \u2013 particularly if you're able to play on PS5 Pro, with ACS representing one of the best upgrades we've seen on the refreshed hardware yet.\n\"Assassin's Creed Shadows thrives on boldness. Its dual protagonists improve on the series' stealth-driven roots and modern RPG leanings, though they're let down by a vague story that fails to make full use of either character,\" says Andrew Brown, author of our Assassin's Creed Shadows review.\nStill, regardless of what model of PS5 you're playing Assassin's Creed Shadows on, it's well worth your time and attention. Dual protagonists Yasuke and Naoe offer wildly different ways to experience the Feudal Japan setting, the former pulling attention on refined combat mechanics and the latter on exceptional advances to Ubisoft's underlying stealth systems. Japan has been a long-requested destination for this series to explore, and Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't disappoint.\nDeveloper: Capcom | Released: 2025 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nMonster Hunter Wilds is some of the most fun you can have with friends on PS5 right now. Capcom started down a path in 2018 to reintroduce its long-running series to western audiences with Monster Hunter World, stripping out some of the more esoteric aspects to its mechanical design to make it more approachable to a wider base of players. Monster Hunter Wilds feels like the inevitable endpoint for that endeavor, and what a delight it is.\n\"With the best combat and narrative in a 20-year series of action RPGs, Monster Hunter Wilds is the new peak of the Monster Hunter series, only further enlivened by a colorful cast of monsters that defies longtime design conventions,\" says Austin Wood, author of our Monster Hunter Wilds review.\nMonster Hunter Wilds has the sharpest game feel in the series to date. Combat is kinetic as you and your pals track, hunt, and battle some astoundingly large monsters, recycling the rewards earned in victory to craft increasingly outrageous weapons and armor. Wilds is undoubtedly the most approachable and accessible entry point into the series to date, something that Capcom has achieved without sacrificing all that much depth. If you've ever wanted to try Monster Hunter, Wilds is the time to do it.\nDeveloper: Studio Zero | Released: 2024 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nAtlus has, in essence, pulled off the impossible with Metaphor: ReFantazio. For players who have grown tired of Final Fantasy's transition away from turn-based combat and complex storytelling towards more action-oriented structures, there's a pretty good chance that discovering Metaphor: ReFantazio will be somewhat revelatory. This monstrous JRPG boasts hundreds of hours of playtime, an incredible world to explore, and a wildly detailed combat system that encourages experimentation. If you've got the time, Metaphor: ReFantazio won't disappoint.\n\"Metaphor: ReFantazio is a triumphant evolution of Atlus' best, and offers a gripping new story supplemented by a loveable cast, dungeons begging to be explored, and a gorgeous art direction that makes you feel like you're wandering the pages of a fairytale book,\" says Catherine Lewis, author of our Metaphor: ReFantazio review.\nThere's a level of quality to the overall production that's hard to ignore as well, with developer Studio Zero delivering exceptional artistic direction and an unforgettable soundtrack to help propel you through the sprawling fantasy setting. That shouldn't come as any surprise either, given that Metaphor: ReFantazio comes from the creative minds responsible for steering the Persona series over the past two decades. Metaphor is a luxuriously crafted RPG with a killer turn-based combat system.\nDeveloper: Housemarque | Released: 2021 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nReturnal was one of the first significant first-party PS5 exclusives released outside of the system's launch window, and the roguelike shooter has lost none of its potency in the last four years. In fact, there's still nothing quite like Returnal available on the platform. It's one of the weirdest blockbusters of the generation, and deliberately challenging \u2013 the sort of experience that you'll walk away from in anger after a failed run before crawling back for more a few minutes later.\n\"Returnal is a breakaway from the type of exclusive Sony typically focuses on, using a genre that has only recently come back into fashion as a starting point for a story that makes you work to understand it, offering plenty to chew on without wrapping it up neatly,\" says Ben Tyrer, author of our Returnal review.\nReturnal sees you trying to survive cycles of violence on a strange alien planet. You're trapped in a time loop, the narrative unfurling gradually as you shift deeper into the planet Atropos. It's one of the slickest shooters on PS5, and one of the best looking titles too \u2013 a true visual and auditory assault on the senses. Death is but a chance to try again in Returnal, a chance to regroup and reapply lessons learned across your descent into strange territories.\nDeveloper: Square Enix | Released: 2024 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nFinal Fantasy 7 Rebirth was always going to be a challenge for developer Square Enix. Its predecessor, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, was a largely faithful reimagining of one of the most iconic RPGs of all-time until it entered its final-phase, engineering a sharp left turn that left more questions than answers. Rebirth takes Final Fantasy veterans into somewhat uncharted territory as a result, retaining key moments of awe and delivering a more layered narrative that'll keep you guessing until the end.\n\"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth delivers all the charm of Final Fantasy 7 Remake while making the needed improvements to side-content and the active combat systems to ensure the original 1997 game's iconic step-out moment is worth taking once more,\" says Iain Harris, author of our Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth review.\nAs the middle portion of a planned trilogy, you will most-likely want to play Final Fantasy 7 Remake before venturing into this sequel, but no matter how you choose to play you'll find an expansive, expressive RPG adventure waiting for you. Square Enix has carefully refined its open-ended exploration, with hundreds of hours of distractions waiting for you outside of the excellent core narrative. Combat and progression is tighter, a is the way the story interweaves with a truly expansive world.\nDeveloper: Capcom | Released: 2023 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nIt's truly astounding how well Resident Evil 4 has stood the rest of time. The iconic survival horror game celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2025, and it's still as potent today as it ever was. But if you're looking for the best way to experience special agent Leon S. Kennedy's mission to rescue the president's daughter from a dangerous cult, you'll want to pick up the stunning Resident Evil 4 Remake \u2013 a genuinely spellbinding adventure that never loosens its grip.\n\"Capcom has delivered a great remake of a classic game, one which captures everything that made it so special to begin with. Resident Evil 4 Remake is full of action and variety that's as exhilarating now as it ever was,\" says Leon Hurley, author of our Resident Evil 4 Remake review.\nWhat's so impressive about the Resident Evil 4 Remake is that it doesn't just preserve the spirit of the original, but enhances it for a new generation of players. The core structure remains intact, but Capcom worked plenty of neat tricks into the play experience which work to revitalize the hectic third-person combat and utterly audacious set-pieces. There's no shortage of fantastic horror games on PS5, but few are able to reach such dizzying heights.\nDeveloper: Guerrilla Games | Released: 2022 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nIf you're looking to stress test your PS5, you'll want to pick up Horizon Forbidden West. The long-awaited sequel to one of Sony Interactive Entertainment's biggest success stories of the PS4 era tracks Aloy as she enters a lush new open-world expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the Western United States overrun by competing factions and towering mechanical dinosaurs. The visual fidelity and scope of the expansive world is genuinely awe-inspiring, and remains somewhat unrivaled in this sense all these years after its release.\n\"Horizon Forbidden West is a tweaked, enhanced, and confident sequel from Guerrilla Games that exceeds expectations, delivering an open world full of compelling characters, an intriguing story, and yes, more super awesome robot dinosaurs to battle across a vast open world,\" says Sam Loveridge, author of our Horizon Forbidden West review.\nDeveloper Guerrilla Games made a number of smart tweaks to the mechanical design which so many millions of players fell in love with through Horizon Zero Dawn, with the studio engineering massive improvements to combat, navigation, and quest design. Horizon Forbidden West is a bigger and more refined experience as a result; a well-tempered evolution that never fails to arrest the attention. Prepare to lose hours of your life to this stunning PS5 exclusive.\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog | Released: 2024 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nThe Last of Us 2 is a genuine achievement. Naughty Dog has built a reputation for breaking boundaries in the action-adventure genre, but there are few modern video games as starkly all-encompassing as this. A sprawling tale of revenge set across a Seattle wasteland, The Last of Us 2 tracks the intertwining lives of Ellie and Abby \u2013 two characters bound spiritually by a hatred for the world around them. An expansive story told in short, sharp shocks of violence.\n\"The Last of Us Part 2 not only justifies its existence as a sequel most didn't think was necessary, supplementing and elevating the timeless qualities of its predecessor, but stands confidently apart as an entirely different beast, one bearing its own fangs that bite with just as much force,\" says Alex Avard, author of our Last of Us 2 review.\nWith The Last of Us Season 2 set to air in April, there's never been a better time to get caught up on the source material. The Last of Us: Part 2 was remastered for PS5 in 2024 (the title was originally released four years before on PS4), bringing visual improvements, faster loading times, and a suite of new gameplay modes and otherwise lost levels. This adventure isn't for the faint of heart, but it's a truly generation-defining experience that set a new standard for play.\nDeveloper: Arrowhead Game Studios | Released: 2024 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nIn what is undoubtedly the best PS5 multiplayer game of the generation, Helldivers 2 takes the Starship Troopers fantasy and turns it into a reality. Whether you are dropping into Automaton-controlled space alone, or pairing up with three other friends to tackle Terminid territories together, Helldivers 2 is a riot . Principally a third-person shooter, your objective is to survive against ever-increasing masses of enemies \u2013 thinning hordes with dwindling ammunition supplies as objectives are completed and friendly-fire casualties are recorded.\n\"At a time when the merits of live-service games are being called into question, Helldivers 2 has the potential to turn that conversation around. I never thought I'd be interested in another one again but, against my better judgment, Helldivers 2 has got me doing my part,\" says Rick Lane, author of our Helldivers 2 review.\nDeveloper Arrowhead has done a phenomenal job of maintaining this live-service phenomenon, a Galactic Map tracking playerbase progression on PS5 and PC in real-time. With few attempts to monetize the experience, and a relaxed approach to battle pass progression, it's possible to drop in and out without fear of falling behind. Brilliantly tactile and exceptionally challenging, Helldivers 2 is best enjoyed with a few buddies who will never let you forget that time you misplaced a deadly stratagem.\nDeveloper: Remedy Entertainment | Released: 2023 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nIf Hereditary and Midsommar distributor A24 made horror games, I imagine the results would look something like Alan Wake 2. It's a boldly produced, fearlessly creative, and deeply-affecting psychological thriller which tracks one story across two unraveling realities. You take control of horror author Alan Wake as he spirals through the Dark Place, a metaphysical prison of comic-horror proportions; and Saga Anderson, an FBI agent investigating a series of ritualistic murders and their connection to Wake's disappearance a decade earlier.\n\"Whenever I thought I had a handle on where Alan Wake 2 was leading me it upended my expectations. It's an intelligent sequel to a cult classic, driven to new heights by the darker impulses necessitated by the horror story. It's also wonderfully silly, and at times brilliantly imaginative,\" says Josh West, author of our Alan Wake 2 review.\nThe best Remedy Entertainment games are known for their propulsive action, evocative atmosphere, and unmistakable sense of place. Alan Wake 2 feels like the pure distillation of these aspects, and it's quite simply peerless as a resulted. If you're a fan of survival horror games like Resident Evil, or are looking for the latest from the team behind Control, then this has my highest recommendation. At a time where blockbuster horror games are synonymous with remakes, Alan Wake 2 is essential.\nDeveloper: CD Projekt Red | Released: 2020 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nIt's honestly astonishing just how far Cyberpunk 2077 has come. When the open-world experience launched in 2020, the PS4 version was in such a rough state that Sony was forced to take unprecedented action: the game was removed from the PlayStation Store, with refunds issued to affected players. What a difference a few years can make. Cyberpunk 2077 can now be considered one of the greatest RPGs of all-time, and a milestone achievement for developer CD Projekt Red \u2013 impressive, given the studio is best known for The Witcher 3.\n\"Phantom Liberty is the culmination of CDPR's efforts to right the wrongs of a challenging launch, with this premium expansion combining with Update 2.0 for a total revitalization of Night City. This is Cyberpunk 2077 at its best,\" says Sam Loveridge, author of our Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review.\nCyberpunk 2077 has a dazzling sense of scale. It's remarkable how small you feel walking the wide streets of Night City, a towering metropolis that you'll easily sink hours into exploring. The depth of customisation and quality of combat is excellent, while the visual fidelity captured through cinematics and conversations has undoubtedly set a new benchmark for the industry. I recommend that you pick up Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the Phantom Liberty expansion.\nDeveloper: Insomniac Games | Released: 2023 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nYou can think of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 as the ultimate reflection of what is possible when talented video game creators are working to squeeze the full potential out of the PlayStation 5. It's a visually ambitious adventure, with expressive character animations and punchy combat packed into a distinctive open world. In many ways we've come to expect nothing less from developer Insomniac Games. But what continues to impress me is just how fluid Marvel's Spider-Man 2 feels in your hands.\n\"Spider-Man 2 improves on its predecessor across the board, while saluting the superhero genre over the last 30 years as a whole. With a captivating narrative and unrivaled spectacle, it's the quintessential superhero game, in story and mechanical terms,\" says Joe Donnelly, author of our Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review.\nThe speed in which Peter Parker and Miles Morales are able to swing around the boroughs of New York City is exceptional, so too is the way you're able to seamlessly transition between the two characters as they do battle against some of the best Spider-Man villains. The more comfortable you become in control, the more you're able to easily build momentum \u2013 the resulting action is thrilling, particularly in a package that is otherwise full of heart, humor, and unforgettable set-pieces.\nReleased: Arkane Studios | Released: 2021 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nDeathloop will challenge your expectations every step of the way. A brand new first-person shooter from Arkane Studios is typically cause for celebration, the studio behind such success stories as Prey and the Dishonored series. But Deathloop isn't an immersive sim in the traditional sense, and is all the better because of it. What you have here is a more self-contained adventure that's dripping with style and subversive action, a puzzle that needs to be carefully pieced together over time.\n\"My impression of Deathloop seemed to shift with every passing hour. It's difficult to not be impressed \u2013 if not thoroughly enthralled \u2013 by what Arkane has achieved here. It's different, it's stylish, and it's new; you won't play anything else quite like Deathloop this generation,\" says Josh West, author of our Deathloop review.\nDeathloop is a murder mystery suspended in a time loop; a first-person shooter that stars a shotgun which can transform into a rifle at the press of a button; and a sci-fi adventure that's stuck in the '70s. And even that description barely scratches the surface. You're charged with eliminating eight targets before the clock strikes midnight, and if you fail the hands of time reset \u2013 leaving you with little more than the knowledge of your past successes and failures. Deathloop is a wild ride.\nDeveloper: Larian Studios | Released: 2023 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nI'll admit that I've never historically been the biggest fan of Dungeons and Dragons, but that didn't stop me from falling in love with the latest masterwork from Larian Entertainment. What you get in Baldur's Gate 3 is the best RPG of the generation, an impossibly complex adventure with a staggering amount of depth and complexity. It's honestly staggering how good this game is at generating stories, and at pulling every player who dives in into different directions with ease.\n\"Baldur's Gate 3 is the most successful, authentic take on Dungeons and Dragons in the tabletop franchise's 50-year history. Its complexity and size might be daunting for novices, but the breadth and depth of BG3's world make this a once-in-a-generation achievement,\" says Ali Jones, author of our Baldur's Gate 3 review.\nIf there's any word of caution I could present to you, it's this: prepare for Baldur's Gate 3 to consume your spare time. Whether you're venturing into the wilds alone or partnering up with a friend for co-op, Baldur's Gate 3 has this incredible ability to become the only thing you'll care about. Combat is challenging, you'll fall in love with the characters, and you'll be shocked when even the smallest decision cascades into an unavoidable calamity. Whether you're a D&D newbie or veteran player, you don't want to miss this one.\nDeveloper: Insomniac Games | Released: 2021 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nI honestly believe that Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is some of the most fun that you can have on PS5. It captures that playful spirit which defined so many of the best PS1 games like lightning in a bottle \u2013 echoing the platformers which once defined the earliest years of Sony's arrival onto the video game market 30 years ago. Developer Insomniac Games outdid itself with this one, an adventure that's just so full of heart, humor, and character that you worry it's going to burst.\n\"Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is one of those rare games that brings back the feeling of being up early on a Saturday morning before your parents wake up, binging your favorite cartoons, and high on sugary cereal. It's one cardiac event of excitement after another,\" says Rachel Weber, author of our Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart review.\nIt certainly doesn't hurt that Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a true PS5 system showcase. The speedy SSD packed inside the system is used to great effect, allowing Ratchet to dynamically cross between worlds and seamlessly leap between encounters which will ignite the imagination. Phenomenal visual fidelity meets haptic combat, packed full of memorable weaponry and character moments that'll leave you delighted. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is pure entertainment for kids of all ages.\nDeveloper: Sony Santa Monica | Released: 2022 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: Yes\nIt's really quite staggering how far developer Sony Santa Monica has taken God of War in two decades. Earlier titles, which still rank among the best PS2 and best PS3 games, are a far cry from what the latest installment has to offer. God of War Ragnarok is a lushly produced, visually expansive, and exceptionally cinematic adventure which tracks Kratos and his teenage son Atreus through increasingly deadly terrain \u2013 the unfolding events among some of the best on PS5.\n\"God of War Ragnarok is a great game, with weighty emotional moments, incredibly satisfying puzzles, and combat that's never less than enjoyable. With a beautiful world full of things to discover, this adventure is a fitting close for Kratos' viking excursions,\" says Leon Hurley, author of our God of War Ragnarok review.\nThe nine realms stand on the cusp of destruction as Ragnarok approaches, an eschatological event that concludes the Norse era of the series. Sony Santa Monica pushes a suite of quality-of-life improvements to the fore, combining them with strikingly slick beat-'em-up combat and the sort of cinematic flair that is so rarely captured outside of first-party PlayStation Studios productions. God of War Ragnarok is a must-play; a staggering spectacle that's packed with fantastic, memorable characters.\nDeveloper: FromSoftware | Released: 2022 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nElden Ring captures such an incredible sense of discovery. Where previous FromSoftware developed games \u2013 Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice \u2013 would leave you stranded at chokepoints, slamming your head against a brick wall until you somehow smashed through, Elden Ring offers complete freedom of movement. It's in that exploration, as you turn away from seemingly insurmountable challenges in search of a distraction, where this adventure excels. There's always something incredible to find, so long as you're daring enough to go out in search of the unknown.\n\"Elden Ring is both an ambitious refinement and careful evolution of the Dark Souls formula, with developer FromSoftware presenting an expansive world that's as hostile as it is inviting. Despite the occasional excess, suffering has never been as much fun as this,\" says Joel Franey, author of our Elden Ring review.\nIt's this aspect which has propelled Elden Ring into being one of the best open world games of the modern era. This dark fantasy isn't going to be for everybody \u2013 it can be exceptionally punishing, even when wielding magic or summoning signs \u2013 but if you're willing to give Elden Ring the time, it'll give you an adventure of a lifetime in return. With the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion out now, the best Souslike on PS5 only reaches new heights. Trust your abilities and dare to fail, you won't regret it.\nDeveloper: Team Asobi | Released: 2024 | PS5 Pro Enhanced: No\nI've thought long and hard about whether Astro Bot's ascension to the number one position on GamesRadar's ranking of the best PS5 games is recency bias, but the truth of it is that Team Asobi has delivered an absolutely astounding experience. In this charming, dazzling platformer, PlayStation finds itself on equal footing with Nintendo \u2013 in Astro Bot, movement is perfectly weighted and challenge carefully calculated. It's a true achievement, and one of the best system showcases that the PS5 has to offer.\n\"Astro Bot doesn't just deliver on the promise and potential displayed in PS5 pack-in demo Astro's Playroom, but soars above and beyond to serve up a near-perfect platformer to rival \u2013 and possibly surpass \u2013 the best of Super Mario's Mushroom Kingdom romps,\" says Matt Cabral, author of our Astro Bot review.\nThat Team Asobi finds itself in this position is incredible. Astro's Playroom was an accessible entrypoint into this new generation, the freely playable technical demo designed to highlight the unique functionality afforded by the DualSense controller. But in this sequel, the studio settles into new rhythms. Astro Bot is a wondrous celebration of 30 years of PlayStation, a pixel perfect platformer, and proof that this hardware still has plenty more to give \u2013 one of the best looking and feeling games on PS5.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

      "text": "Naughty Dog cancels The Last of Us multiplayer game after nearly four years of work\nPre-production work began before The Last of Us 2 released\nThe Last of Us multiplayer spin-off has effectively been canceled at Naughty Dog.\nThe developer has made the announcement in a blog post posted to its website and social media. \"There's no easy way to say this: We've made the incredibly difficult decision to stop development on that game,\" Naughty Dog writes in the blog, acknowledging that many were eagerly awaiting news on the game they'd come to call 'The Last of Us Online.'\nAn Update on The Last of Us Online: https://t.co/nMUm7TmH9h pic.twitter.com/fmuXCLzDMBDecember 14, 2023\n\"We know this news will be tough for many, especially our dedicated The Last of Us Factions community, who have been following our multiplayer ambitions ardently,\" the announcement continues. \"We're equally crushed at the studio as we were looking forward to putting it in your hands. We wanted to share with you some background of how we came to this decision.\"\nNaughty Dog then reveals that the multiplayer team had been in \"pre-production,\" before The Last of Us 2 even launched. That means, in theory, the multiplayer team has been in pre-production for nearly four years now. Naughty Dog also says the entire experience was \"unique and had tremendous potential.\"\nHowever, with the increase in production came a \"massive scope\" in ambition. \"To release and support The Last of Us Online we'd have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post-launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games,\" the studio then writes.\nSo the studio was left with two paths: become a \"solely live service games studio,\" or continue to make single-player games, but ditch the new multiplayer project. Naughty Dog chose the latter, prioritizing its single-player games over going all-in on the one multiplayer game.\nNaughty Dog ends the message by adding they've got \"more than one ambitious, brand new single-player game\" in the works right now, and they're looking forward to sharing more about them at a future date. We don't currently know if this is an original game for Naughty Dog or revisiting an established series like The Last of Us.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nA report claimed back in October that The Last of Us multiplayer was \"on ice\" amid layoffs at Naughty Dog. The following month, the game director on the multiplayer game said he was still working on it, but all that has surely ended now with Naughty Dog's very public cancellation.\nYou can read up on our upcoming PS5 games for a look at all the games still on Sony's schedule for the next year and beyond.\nHirun Cryer is a freelance reporter and writer with Gamesradar+ based out of U.K. After earning a degree in American History specializing in journalism, cinema, literature, and history, he stepped into the games writing world, with a focus on shooters, indie games, and RPGs, and has since been the recipient of the MCV 30 Under 30 award for 2021.

      "text": "Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann reaffirms the Last of Us studio is working on another game alongside Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but he's \"more of a producer\" on it\nAny guesses on what it is?\nWe're all very excited for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but did you know Naughty Dog has another game in the works? We don't know much about it apart from the fact Neil Druckmann is a producer rather than a director, so it could be quite different to the studio's recent games.\nBack in 2023, Druckmann confirmed the studio had \"other projects in the works\" when he was asked about the potential of a Last of Us Part 3. We now know that one of those projects was Intergalactic, but there's not much information about to what the other (or others) could be.\nWhat we do know is that the studio is working on \"more than one ambitious, brand new single player game,\" which sounds like it'll be another new IP rather than a sequel or remake.\nYesterday, on the Press X to Continue YouTube channel, Druckmann said: \"There's another game that's being worked on in Naughty Dog where I'm more of a producer role and I get to mentor and watch this other team and give feedback and be like the executive in the room. I enjoy all those roles. And the fact that I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I'm never bored.\"\nThe last original game to come out of Naughty Dog that didn't credit Druckmann as a director was 2017's Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. A lot of fans, myself included, loved Chloe and Nadine's journey, so we could be getting more of them as Nathan Drake has hung up his treasure hunting hat \u2013 figuratively, of course. He never wore a hat.\nThe wording of \"brand new\" makes it seem more likely it will be another new IP, which would be quite exciting, because in the last decade the studio has put out three sequels and three remasters or remakes.\nSince we don't know much about this untitled project, and we don't even know when Intergalactic is coming out, check out all the confirmed upcoming video game release dates so you have something to look forward to.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI'm Issy, a freelancer who you'll now occasionally see over here covering news on GamesRadar.

      "text": "Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet apparently has \"RPG progression systems,\" which could be as simple as The Last of Us' supplements or usher in a whole new era\nIt's a vague term, so the possibilities are endless\nNaughty Dog is making its first new, non-sequel game in over a decade, and I couldn't be more excited. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet stars one of my favorite actors, Tati Gabrielle, and thanks to a former-developer's LinkedIn profile, we now have a hint at what it might be like to play as her character \u2013 the bounty hunter Jordan.\nPosted to Reddit and spotted by TheGamer, Kristina Gu's LinkedIn profile states she was an associate technical designer at Naughty Dog between August, 2022 and February, 2024. In that time, she worked on The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, The Last of Us Online \u2013 rest in peace Factions 2 \u2013 and \"RPG progression systems on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.\"\nFormer Naughty Dog designer lists working on RPG progression systems for Intergalactic from r/Intergalactic\nNow, before you go thinking this means Intergalactic is going to play like the new God of War games or Dragon Age, remember that The Last of Us games have what you could consider RPG systems in them, too.\nThe supplements you use to increase Joel and Ellie's stats such as health or listen-mode distance are basically an RPG progression system, as are the upgrades you can make for your weapons. All these things factor into how you choose to play.\nSo, this little detail from LinkedIn doesn't tell us a whole lot about Intergalactic, as the RPG elements could be very light like those outlined above, or they could be more in the vein of God of War or Far Cry's skill trees.\nWe won't know for sure until we get a gameplay trailer of some sort. It likely won't be coming out until 2027 at the earliest though, so be prepared for a long wait.\nIn the meantime, check out all the upcoming games of 2025 that you can get your hands on much sooner.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI'm Issy, a freelancer who you'll now occasionally see over here covering news on GamesRadar.

      "text": "The Last of Us Online lead and Uncharted veteran is opening a new studio in Japan after 10 years at PlayStation's Naughty Dog\nMore than a year after the multiplayer spin-off's cancelation\nA former Naughty Dog game director who led the sadly scrapped Last of Us Online project is now opening a new studio in Japan.\nVinit Agarwal worked at the famed PlayStation studio for more than a decade on hits like Uncharted 4, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part 2 as a designer, before eventually directing a standalone multiplayer project that never crossed the finish line.\nAfter leaving Naughty Dog earlier this year, the developer just revealed a \"couple of life updates,\" like the fact that he's moving to Japan and \"also forming a game studio \u2013 more on that soon!\"\nThere's no concrete information about what this unannounced studio might release, but Agarwal says he's currently making a multiplayer game in Unreal Engine 5 via an earlier social media exchange. \"I can't speak for what [Naughty Dog is] planning, but I'm going to continue making multiplayer games because that's what I\u2019m passionate about,\" he wrote at the time.\nNaughty Dog somewhat infamously threw its in-development multiplayer spin-off in the bin after Bungie reportedly told studio heads how much work it would require, having fed its own live service beast for years. The Last of Us Online was initially going to be bolted on to The Last of Us Part 2 \u2013 just as the original game's Factions mode was \u2013 though it eventually ballooned into its own full-fat game that would probably distract from the studio's single-player ambitions, including the upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet and a number of other mysterious games.\nHere are some other new games of 2025 and beyond that haven't been canned.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and this one, Gamesradar.

      "text": "Following his departure from Naughty Dog earlier this year, game developer Vinit Agarwal moved to Japan and started his own game studio. While both the studio name and its upcoming multiplayer title are still under wraps, Agarwal is determined to put to use what he learned from Naughty Dog into his new Japan-based game development environment.\nIn a recent interview with Game*Spark, Agarwal says that the primary reason he left Naughty Dog was because he saw the potential in creating multiplayer games that incorporate the kind of cinematic action Naughty Dog is known for. After working on both the single-player and multiplayer modes of Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part II (including the latter\u2019s cancelled multiplayer mode), Agarwal founded a new company alongside Joe Pettinati, Naughty Dog\u2019s former narrative lead and creative director. But while Pettinati remained in the United States, Agarwal moved to Japan \u2013 allowing the two to develop games from two bases.\nSpeaking about his time at Naughty Dog, Agarwal is grateful for having worked at a company that prioritizes detailed design and fine adjustments. While graphics and gameplay are important, Agarwal was most inspired by the company\u2019s approach to worldbuilding and narrative.\nNaughty Dog also fosters a culture where everyone, no matter their position, can voice their ideas and opinions. As a new employee, Agarwal was surprised to find that everyone at the company listened to his opinions. This attention to detail and high level of freedom are what Agarwal wants to bring to his new studio.\nAs for the reason why Agarwal decided to move to Japan, he explains that he has been inspired by Japanese game development ever since he entered the game industry. He is especially interested in how strongly Japanese games focus on the director\u2019s creative vision. After talking to FromSoftware\u2019s Hidetaka Miyazaki (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Elden Ring), Agarwal was reminded of his love of this auteur-driven development style, which he plans to implement in his studio\u2019s new multiplayer game.\nWhile details about the game are shrouded in mystery, Agarwal has revealed that it will be a \u201ctriple-indie\u201d multiplayer title that blends AAA-reminiscent cinematic flair and storytelling with the fact-paced feeling characteristic of indies. The project is being built in Unreal Engine 5, with internal playtesting set to begin soon. By bringing Japanese engineers on board, Agarwal intends to bring together the best aspects of Eastern and Western game development."
