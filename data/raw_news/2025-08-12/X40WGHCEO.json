  "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The Padres no longer loom in the rearview mirror. They are hurtling toward October, now abreast with the defending World Series champions.\n\nWhile the Los Angeles Dodgers were walked off for a third consecutive loss, the Padres kept surging Tuesday. They beat the San Francisco Giants, 5-1, to win a fifth straight series and move into a tie atop the National League West.\n\nIn a vacuum, that might not mean much. It\u2019s Aug. 12. But there is this, too: It\u2019s the first time San Diego (68-52) has held at least a share of first place after any All-Star break since 2010. And with a pair of weekend series coming up against Los Angeles, the Padres will soon have the opportunity to speed past the Dodgers.\n\nSo far, San Diego\u2019s stars and supporting players have aligned in what could go down as a second half to remember. A secondary drought ended in Tuesday\u2019s second inning when Jose Iglesias sent a long fly ball to left. That gave the Padres a lead they would not yield. It also gave Iglesias, the veteran reserve infielder, his first home run in 269 at-bats.\n\nThe two-run drive, which bounced off the top of Oracle Park\u2019s outfield wall, was representative of a collective reversal of fortune \u2014 and, more importantly, production.\n\nBefore the Padres acquired Ram\u00f3n Laureano, Ryan O\u2019Hearn and Freddy Fermin on July 31, the team ranked last in the majors with a .584 on-base plus slugging percentage from the seventh through ninth spots in the lineup. Since the trade deadline, the bottom third of the order has shaped up.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to win a championship, you can\u2019t have really any weak links,\u201d A.J. Preller, San Diego\u2019s president of baseball operations, said on a deadline day in which he shipped out 14 young players and brought in six big leaguers.\n\n\u201cWe know that the pressure is on other teams just with the bullpen we have,\u201d left fielder Gavin Sheets said after Monday\u2019s series-opening win against the Giants. \u201cAnd I think that when you use a bullpen like that as a weapon, and then you have a really deep lineup, it just puts a lot of pressure on the other team.\u201d\n\nSheets, an everyday player before the trade deadline, spoke after providing two hits in his first start in a week.\n\n\u201cGuy\u2019s a gamer,\u201d center fielder Jackson Merrill said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing out of his mind all year. He\u2019s been a great human being, too. So, I\u2019m just happy to see him in there again, and obviously, he comes through usually when he\u2019s in the lineup.\u201d\n\nA day later, Sheets returned to the bench as other players started the Padres\u2019 latest complete performance.\n\nDeadline addition Nestor Cortes tossed 4 2/3 innings, holding the Giants to their lone run. Standout rookie David Morgan, All-Star setup man Jason Adam, All-Star setup man Adrian Morejon and All-Star closer Robert Suarez combined to record the final 13 outs.\n\nOn offense, Laureano singled ahead of Iglesias\u2019 home run. The newcomer doubled in his next at bat, stole third base and scored on a single by Jake Cronenworth. Merrill, who struck out in each of his first two at-bats, doubled his next time up and homered in the eighth. The Padres, in all, collected 10 hits, and later that night, a share of first-place.",

      "text": "The reactions ranged from curiosity to awe to personal lament.\nAs A.J. Preller put the finishing touches on the busiest transacting day of his 11-year tenure, the San Diego Padres general manager evoked strong opinions from various corners of the industry. This was normal, even if the circumstances were not. It was Thursday afternoon on the West Coast, and over the seven hours that led up to another trade deadline, Preller and the title-chasing Padres had pulled off five trades involving 22 players, including a blockbuster that saw them land baseball\u2019s hardest thrower while moving one of the sport\u2019s best prospects.\nAdvertisement\nOne rival evaluator panned the acquisition of Mason Miller as an overpay, noting that the star reliever\u2019s performance, while impressive, could be recreated at the kind of cost that did not include teenage shortstop Leo De Vries. Another wondered if San Diego had suddenly rebranded itself as the most dangerous team in the National League. \u201cThe volume of deals made by them,\u201d the scout said, \u201cis something out of a video game.\u201d Still another person worried that a planned trip to watch a Padres minor-league affiliate could prove fruitless.\n\u201cMight be me and an empty stadium because of forfeit,\u201d the third evaluator said.\nIt was a joke. It also felt appropriate. No GM pursues splashes or eschews half-measures as relentlessly as Preller. Thursday might have brought his most aggressive and most creative trade deadline yet.\nThe Padres added Miller to what was already a league-best bullpen. They hung onto incumbent closer Robert Suarez and starter Dylan Cease, reasoning that the pending free agents could still provide more value than what they might have brought back. The Padres splurged for a new primary catcher in Freddy Fermin. They altered the complexion of a previously top-heavy offense by importing Ryan O\u2019Hearn and Ram\u00f3n Laureano.\nThey replaced some newly departed rotation depth by adding JP Sears and Nestor Cortes, who joined O\u2019Hearn as the lone rentals among the newcomers. In lesser moves, they acquired a Triple-A infielder and a low-level shortstop prospect.\nThey made all these additions while shipping out 14 young players. It was a dizzying collection of capital, from De Vries, whom some scouts already view as a top-five prospect in the sport, to promising big-league starters Stephen Kolek and Ryan Bergert, to talented minor-league pitchers Braden Nett and Boston Bateman.\nAdvertisement\nArguably just as notable, the Padres accomplished all of this while increasing their payroll and luxury-tax numbers by only a few million dollars. According to FanGraphs, the former figure ticked up to $215 million, the latter to $267 million.\n\u201cFrom that standpoint, I think it\u2019s going to end up probably being a pretty neutral process,\u201d Preller said.\nPreller\u2019s lack of financial flexibility \u2014 or at least the kind he once enjoyed \u2014 was no secret. His biggest backer, late owner Peter Seidler, died in November 2023. Since then, the Padres have traded away star outfielder Juan Soto. They have significantly reduced what was a bloated payroll. They have continued operating amid a legal dispute between Seidler\u2019s widow and two of his brothers, a conflict that remains ongoing.\nThe trades were bold. The vision feels fragile sometimes.\nBut AJ\u2019s still upholding the dream.\nThank you for your excellence.\n\ud83d\udc9b\ud83e\udd0e#ForTheFaithful\u2014 Sheel Seidler (@sheel_padres) July 31, 2025\nSo far, they have weathered these storms. The newly upgraded Padres, on paper, look as formidable as the 2024 Padres, who gave the eventual champion Los Angeles Dodgers a scare last October. Less than a year later, the 2025 Padres survived an often-rocky four months to awake on deadline day just three games behind L.A.\nNow, that distance could be further bridged by a bullpen that will integrate Miller into the majors\u2019 deepest array of setup men. According to team officials, the initial plan is for Suarez, the major-league saves leader, to remain as the primary closer. That would allow manager Mike Shildt to deploy Miller and his powerful arm in a variety of high-leverage situations.\n\u201cLike we\u2019ve seen so far through the first 100 games, if we have an opportunity to shorten the game, you want to take that,\u201d Preller said. \u201cI think also it gives Mike an opportunity to mix and match with the \u2019pen, an opportunity certain nights to be able to go to one set of relievers and give guys an opportunity to get a little bit of a rest and a blow and be fresh for, hopefully, what\u2019s a long run here for the rest of the regular season and into the postseason.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMiller, who turns 27 next month, represents one of the sport\u2019s bigger gambles. He ranks first in average fastball velocity and second in strikeout rate, and the former Athletics closer comes with four additional years of affordable club control. The Padres could extract even more value by stretching him out as a starter as soon as next season.\nHowever, the last time he started in the majors, he sprained his ulnar collateral ligament as a rookie in 2023. The Padres theoretically could have doubled down on their bullpen by acquiring a less famous reliever with a more modest price tag and similar results. (Despite strong underlying numbers, Miller has pitched to a 3.76 ERA this season.) Recent weeks did little to change the perception that Preller gravitates toward the biggest available names, sometimes to the detriment of his roster construction.\nStill, he was busy in more than one area. Fermin gives San Diego a controllable, quality catcher at what was a position of dire need. O\u2019Hearn and Laureano should help revitalize a lineup that often felt like it ran only seven or eight deep. The front office was willing to bet that, with free agency dangling in front of him, Cease could turn around his season over the next two months.\nThe Padres know they might come to regret all that they gave up Thursday. Still, Preller, who has plenty of reason to rue past deals, keeps finding ways to replenish a farm system that is often criticized for vanishing depth. The price of his latest blockbuster featured De Vries, who received a $4.2 million signing bonus in 2024. The rest of the A\u2019s return consisted of an undrafted signee (Nett), a $125,000 international signee (Henry Baez) and a minor-league signee (Eduarniel N\u00fa\u00f1ez).\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty incredible he could spin N\u00fa\u00f1ez as part of the deal for Miller and Sears,\u201d said one National League scout.\nAnyone can acquire and flip minor-league signees, of course. Almost no general manager seems as unafraid to trade the likes of De Vries, outfielder James Wood and left-hander MacKenzie Gore. (The Padres had discussions about potentially reacquiring Gore from the Washington Nationals. They found the cost prohibitive, as they did in their pursuits of the Cleveland Guardians\u2019 Steven Kwan and the Boston Red Sox\u2019s Jarren Duran.)\n\u201cFor us, we\u2019ve talked more about making fair deals and deals that work for both sides,\u201d Preller said, citing his December 2023 trade of Soto that brought back starting pitcher Michael King as the headliner. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the deal should be. You know, deals that help both teams win. That\u2019s the perspective we take. You obviously are always trying to make good trades, but I think we understand we\u2019ve got to give up good players to get good players.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAt the end, if it puts your team in a good position for now and for the future, that\u2019s a positive outcome. And if we\u2019re doing our job, you\u2019re going to have players in the big leagues (that are) doing well. And I think teams understand that, yeah, we\u2019ll deal some players that will do that.\u201d\nOnly a few months from now, Preller\u2019s latest mortgaging of the future could prove ill-advised. Perhaps it will amount to a seemingly short-sighted attempt by a GM approaching the final year of his contract. The impact of the Padres\u2019 latest batch of club-controlled additions might pale in comparison to the potential losses of Cease, Suarez, King and first baseman Luis Arraez \u2014 all key contributors, and all potential free agents.\nFor now, Preller\u2019s most frenetic day of activity remains a sight to behold. Not least because, after everything that happened over the past 21 months, the Padres suddenly appear to have as good a chance as ever at running down that elusive title.\n(Photo: Sean M.
