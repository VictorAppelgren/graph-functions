  "content": "Two people are dead and two Pennsylvania state troopers are recovering after a shooting in northeastern Susquehanna County on Aug. 7, which also left an EMT injured.\n\nPennsylvania State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris said Troopers Joseph Perechinsky and William Jenkins III were struck by an \"ambush\" of gunfire when they responded to a call of shots fired along state Route 171, around 5 miles north of Thompson, Pennsylvania, at 11:17 a.m.\n\nLori Wasko, 57, was found fatally shot near her vehicle at the scene, Paris said. Investigators believe Wasko's neighbor Carmine Faino, 61, shot her and the troopers before he was killed by police.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro said Perechinsky saved his partner's life and the lives of community members in the area during the incident.\n\n\u201cHe acted decisively. He acted thoughtfully. And the work he did today exemplifies the absolute best of the Pennsylvania State Police,\u201d Shapiro told reporters.\n\nWhat happened during the shooting?\n\nParis said Faino shot the troopers and fired dozens of rounds at their vehicles and that of EMT Carl Lawson, who was driving to the scene to assist. The shots at Lawson's vehicle caused him to veer off the road, crash into a tree and sustain physical injuries. He was listed in stable condition Aug. 7.\n\nPerechinsky sustained two bullet wounds to his chest and torso area. Jenkins was shot once in each arm. Perechinsky was able to apply tourniquets to them to slow the bleeding.\n\nAfter being shot, the trooper also ordered a driver to pull his tractor-trailer across the roadway to stop more people from driving into the area and potentially being subjected to gunfire, Paris said.\n\nPolice attempted to create a perimeter around Faino using a drone, but he was able to shoot it down with a long-range assault rifle. At one point, Paris said Faino sat on top of a propane tank, leading police to believe he was looking to use it as an explosive device.\n\nAfter negotiating \u201cat length,\u201d Paris said, police shot and killed Faino at the scene.\n\nJenkins and Perechinsky were evacuated by troopers at the scene to a nearby field where they were airlifted to a hospital and were reported to be in stable condition.\n\nParis said the department is currently working with the Susquehanna County District Attorney\u2019s Office to investigate the lethal force used against Faino.",
