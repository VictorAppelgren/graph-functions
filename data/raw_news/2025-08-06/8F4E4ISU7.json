  "content": "The Daily Bucket is a regular series from the Backyard Science group. Here we talk about Mother Nature in all her glory, especially the parts that live nearby. So let us know (as close as you are comfortable) where you are and what's going on around you. What's the weather like? Seen any interesting plants, bugs or critters? Are there birds at your feeders? Deer, foxes or snakies in your yard? Seen any cool rocks or geological features? Post your observations and notes here. And photos. We like photos. :)\n\nPinellas County (which includes the cities of St Petersburg and Clearwater) is the most densely populated county in Florida, and has been paved over for human use virtually from end to end. But even in this gigantic cement slab, life can be found everywhere.\n\nMany people tend to view urban areas as some sort of exception to nature, a place where humans rule unilaterally and Mother Nature cannot live. I believe they are mistaken: urban areas are every bit as much a part of the natural landscape as any other habitat. They are not supernatural entities which dropped here from the outside: they are simply the latest stage of Homo sapiens doing what we (and our evolutionary ancestors) have always done since the Miocene\u2014modifying our environment to our liking. Humans have done what no other Earth organism has ever been able to do\u2014use our brainpower to alter our surroundings at will, thus making our evolution \u201cLamarckian\u201d, and allowing us to adapt quickly and accurately to our circumstances through immediate behavioral means without waiting for the slow process of Darwinian genetic selection to do it for us. It is how we have been able to\u2014for better or worse\u2014dominate the natural world.\n\n .\n\nThe urban landscapes that we have created are the product of that natural process, and they have now become another habitat in the natural world. Like other habitats (such as polar regions or deserts) they may not be suitable for everything, and many organisms will be unable to adapt to them. But some will, and some will even thrive here. Life abhors a vacuum, life takes advantage of every opportunity, and life finds a way. And while most other habitats, like rainforests and Arctic snowcaps, are shrinking due to human activity, the urban habitat is the only one that is steadily growing, and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future.\n\nMany people, of course, including many ecologists and environmentalists, condemn this, and view it as a human encroachment on \u201cthe wild\u201d. But urban wildlife is now an ecological fact of life, whether we like it or not. And whether we help them, hinder them, or ignore them, those organisms that can adapt to urban living will continue to get better and better at it. We may have built the new habitat, but it is Mother Nature who is filling it.\n\nThe Wood Storks have been hanging out for years in the parking lot of a restaurant that is next to that trash bin. The nearest pond is a couple miles away, so I have always wondered what the attraction was for that spot and why they like to hang around there all day. (That particular restaurant is only open sporadically.) It may be that they hang around just to snag up the scraps whenever the Chinese restaurant dumps their trash. But I\u2019m not sure\u2014there does not seem to me to be enough food scrap for everyone there to make a living, and the Gulls seem to get most of it anyway. But perhaps there is enough to keep the Storks hanging out nearby, waiting patiently for the dinner bell to ring again.\n\nAnd now it is your turn: what\u2019s adapting to your neck of the woods?\n\nWe are always looking for new people to produce Daily Buckets, where we practice \"backyard science\" by reporting and recording what we have seen in the natural world around us (and no matter where you are--even in the middle of the city--there is nature around you). You don't need any science degrees or training or in-depth experience to be a backyard scientist, and you don't need any expensive camera equipment or photo-editing software to do Daily Buckets. All you need is a pair of eyes and ears, a phone with a camera, and a lot of curiosity and enthusiasm.",

  "summary": "The Daily Bucket series, a series of photos from the Backyard Science group, features the most densely populated county in Florida, Pinellas County, where life can be found even in a concrete slab paved over for human use. The series argues that urban areas are not as much a part of the natural landscape as any other habitat and that humans have always modified our environment to suit our needs. The urban landscapes created by humans have become another habitat in the natural world, allowing organisms to adapt quickly and accurately to their circumstances rather than waiting for the slow process of Darwinian genetic selection to occur. While most other habitats like rainforests and Arctic snowcaps are shrinking due to human activity, the urban habitat is steadily growing, with some predicting it will continue to grow.",

Despite being heavily modified by human activity, urban habitats support various forms of wildlife that adapt to these environments. The article highlights the resilience of life, noting that while some species thrive in urban settings, others may struggle, and invites readers to contribute their own experiences of nature in their surroundings.",
