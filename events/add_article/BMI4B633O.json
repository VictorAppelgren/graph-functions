      "summary": "Coffee futures have surged more than 33% since July, with ground coffee prices hitting a record $8.41 per pound in the U.S. The rally is fueled by droughts in Brazil and Vietnam, a 50% U.S. tariff on Brazilian coffee, and overall supply concerns. While improved weather in Brazil and a better outlook for Vietnam may ease pressure, the tariff remains a key driver of higher prices. The impact on consumers varies, with large chains likely absorbing most tariff costs, but grocery prices are expected to stay elevated for the near term.",
