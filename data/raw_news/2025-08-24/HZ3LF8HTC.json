  "title": "Why Gen Z Is Delaying Major Life Events \u2014 And What It Means For Work",
  "description": "Gen Z is putting off marriage, kids, and passions. These delays are reshaping how they view ambition, stability, and the role of work in their lives.",
  "content": "On paper she was thriving: leading projects, hitting numbers, drawing praise from senior leaders. In reality she was drained. She hadn\u2019t seen her doctor in two years. The long-distance relationship she was trying to hold together had ended. Every time she thought about further education, she pushed it off. Weekends meant for rest turned into work catch-up. She brought her laptop to weddings, answered emails at midnight, and convinced herself this was the cost of momentum. When she finally quit, the company called it burnout. She saw it differently: life that had been waiting too long.\n\nHer story isn\u2019t unusual. New Gallup research shows Gen Z (15%) and Millennials (13%) are far more likely than Gen X (6%) or Baby Boomers (2%) to say they\u2019ve delayed four or more major life events because of career demands. Half of Gen Z report putting personal passions on hold, and half say they\u2019ve delayed taking care of their own health and wellbeing \u2014 higher than any other generation, including Millennials.\n\nWhat starts as manageable tradeoffs \u2014 a late night here, a missed class there \u2014 grows into bigger sacrifices: health, relationships, creative expression, even the chance to start over. The longer those pieces of life are set aside, the harder it becomes to reclaim them.\n\nBusiness Insider reports that Gen Z is holding off on marriage, homeownership, and family formation. They\u2019re not drifting. They\u2019ve lived through recessions, a pandemic, and debts that don\u2019t ease, so hesitation makes sense. MarketWatch calls it a \u201cromance recession\u201d: more than half of Gen Z spend nothing on dating each month, a shift that cascades into delayed marriage, children, and home buying.\n\nThat pause shows up at work too. Gallup finds employees who delay two or more major life events are over four times more likely to report burnout and more than six times more likely to say their job has harmed their mental health. For Gen Z, the strain is sharper. A Deloitte survey shows only about half rate their mental wellbeing as good, while four in ten say they feel stressed or anxious most of the time. A third name their jobs as the main driver \u2014 citing long hours, lack of recognition, and toxic cultures as the biggest culprits.\n\nA Walton Family Foundation and Gallup study found fewer than half of younger Gen Zers feel motivated or believe their work or studies have meaning. When life is pushed off long enough, it drains the job too \u2014 less focus, less drive, weaker ties to the work.\n\nAnd you can hear it in the way people explain their choices. A young project manager told me she turned down a promotion because it meant even less time to care for her father. \u201cI know what the job would give me,\u201d she said. \u201cI also know what it would take away.\u201d\n\nOlder workers often assumed sacrifice would eventually pay off. Gen Z doesn\u2019t. They\u2019ve seen parents burn out, friends graduate into debt, navigated school during a pandemic, and companies walk back commitments. The bargain of working now to live later feels broken.\n\nThey\u2019re also coming of age in a culture that rewards constant grind. The gig economy and side hustles promise flexibility but often deliver instability. Instead of clear career paths, many see pieced-together income streams that keep them busy but rarely secure.\n\nComparison makes it heavier. An Instagram feed full of peers announcing promotions, new jobs, or startups creates the sense that everyone else is moving faster. For those delaying milestones because of career or financial strain, the scrolling isn\u2019t harmless. Delay begins to feel like falling behind.\n\nIt usually shows up in ordinary ways \u2014 another doctor\u2019s visit skipped, a hobby left half-finished, a relationship pulled thin. Each delay makes the next one easier. After a while, what was supposed to be temporary starts to feel permanent.\n\nAnd as work pushes further in, identity narrows. Someone who used to say they were a runner, a friend, an artist, begins introducing themselves only by job title. The story of who they are weakens. And when that story fades, so does their tie to where they work.\n\nGen Z doesn\u2019t soften the point. They\u2019ll say it directly: if work keeps taking over life, then work isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nWhat Leaders Need to Do\n\nThe urgency for leaders is clear: Gen Z is putting off health, family, and passions. Workplaces that support them through these moments will keep them. Others won\u2019t.\n\u2022 Let passion show up in the work. If someone cares about climate, design, or storytelling, they don\u2019t want to park that at the door. They want it to count in their role. When leaders make space for it, employees feel recognized as more than a job title. That could mean giving a design-minded analyst the chance to shape the next town hall deck, or inviting a natural storyteller to help the CEO script a talk track that connects with new recruits. Aligning strengths with passion turns side interests into contributions that lift the organization.\n\u2022 Treat leave as proof of trust. A caregiving break or sabbatical isn\u2019t a gap. For Gen Z, it\u2019s a test. If the company welcomes them back, they\u2019ll remember. If it doesn\u2019t, they\u2019ll move on.\n\u2022 Notice life unblurred. The blurred Zoom background hides more than messy rooms. Behind it are guitars, books, pets, posters of favorite artists, family photos. Gen Z pays attention to whether managers see them as more than a silhouette. Leaders who look for the unblurred parts usually keep people longer.\n\u2022 Adapt roles to today\u2019s pressures. Many in Gen Z are carrying student debt, facing housing costs that don\u2019t add up, or piecing together income from multiple jobs. They\u2019re not raising kids yet, but they know those challenges are ahead. What they want now is proof that work can bend \u2014 and that it will still bend when tomorrow\u2019s responsibilities arrive.\n\u2022 Trade ladders for launchpads. Gen Z isn\u2019t chasing rungs. They see careers as a series of launches \u2014 projects, skills, and experiences that give them lift. A new title without momentum doesn\u2019t feel like progress. If leaders keep offering only ladders, the best people will launch elsewhere \u2014 even into the uncertainty of gig work, because at least there the choice feels like theirs.\n\nGen Z grew up watching systems falter. They\u2019ve lived through enough broken promises to trust their own read of reality more than company slogans. Every year that health, relationships, or passions are delayed is a reminder that \u201clater\u201d may never arrive.\n\nThey won\u2019t keep deferring life. If the cost of the job rises too high, they\u2019ll leave. If milestones keep being dismissed, they\u2019ll stop chasing them.\n\nAnd when that happens, it won\u2019t just be another turnover statistic. It will show up in thinner leadership pipelines, in Gen Zs stretched beyond capacity, in strategies abandoned halfway because the very people who might have carried them forward are already somewhere else \u2014 building the lives they couldn\u2019t build inside your company.",

      "text": "The headline was hard to ignore. It spread across national media like wildfire\u2014equal parts funny, frustrating, and concerning. What was the headline?\n\u201c26% of Gen Z Applicants Brought a Parent to a Job Interview.\u201d\nMany laughed. Some were outraged. But behind the humor is a growing anxiety in boardrooms and break rooms alike: Is Gen Z truly ready for the workforce?\nAccording to a survey by Resume Templates, this statistic isn\u2019t a joke\u2014it\u2019s a reality. One that\u2019s revealing what employers across the country are already experiencing: a generation entering the workplace with immense potential, but in many cases, lacking the social-emotional and professional readiness to thrive.\nAnd yet, we\u2019ve seen this movie before.\nEvery generation gets labeled. Boomers were rebellious. Gen X was disengaged. Millennials were \u201centitled.\u201d Now Gen Z\u2014tech-savvy, deeply aware, but often disconnected\u2014is under the microscope.\nBut this moment feels different.\nThis time, rather than mocking or blaming, some leaders are stepping up to ask the harder question: What\u2019s our role in this?\nI recently saw quote that really hit home for me. It\u2019s literally brilliant and so spot-on that I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\u201cThe future of the workforce can only be built through belief and possibility. When we commit to training and mentorship, we don\u2019t just fill roles, we unlock potential.\u201d\n~ Warner L. Thomas, President and CEO, Sutter Health\nThomas, who oversees a massive healthcare system in Northern California, is right. Pointing fingers, placing blame, or even paying more for a more seasoned candidate isn\u2019t going to solve the problem of an entire generation entering the workforce without the necessary socialization, skills, and attitudes to thrive.\nCurious, I reached out to Warner and a few other experts who know a lot more about hiring Gen Z than I do. And, I asked them: \u201cHow do we train a generation that isn\u2019t ready to enter the workforce? And, how do we take accountability for a situation we created?\u201d\nTracie Meier, Vice President, Early Careers at Oracle: \u201cWe\u2019re building the products of the future, which means we need to be recruiting the best and brightest talent,\u201d Meier told me. \u201c\u2026and they have to have the necessary hard and soft skills. If Early Career employees aren\u2019t prepared for the workplace\u2014socially, emotionally, and professionally\u2014then we\u2019ll struggle with them technically and intellectually as well. So, if we want world class, we need to evolve leadership and take action.\u201d\nKen May, Former CEO of FedEx Office and TopGolf: \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to workplace culture if the entering workforce isn\u2019t equipped to handle workplace culture?\u201d May asked. \u201cIt will erode. As leaders we need to take responsibility\u2014and that means we need to take care of the employees who come to work for us. Generational situations will always create new behaviors and attitudes. It\u2019s not our job to say \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d As leaders, it\u2019s our job to say, \u201cWe can help you.\u201d\nWarner L. Thomas, President and CEO of Sutter Health: \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect different outcomes if we\u2019re unwilling to train different approaches,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThis starts by understanding the unique and individual perspectives of your people so that as leaders, we know where to invest in their training.\u201d\nChester Elton, New York Times Bestselling Author of Leading with Gratitude: \u201cRelationships are key to performance,\u201d Elton said. \u201cAnd, when we dive into a discussion around generations, we\u2019re really just talking about the relationships. Relationships are difficult to build if we just say one group is wrong. We\u2019re all individuals. It doesn\u2019t matter when you were born. We all want to be recognized and appreciated. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\nDavid M. Carlisle, MD, PhD, President, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science: \u201cWorkplace readiness means much more than resum\u00e9s and credentials. At Charles R. Drew University, we shape and celebrate healthcare leaders who bring purpose, equity, and authenticity to everything they do.\u201d\nCynthia Teniente-Matson, EdD, President, San Jose State University: \u201cOur students are never a problem to fix, but a promise to fulfill. It is our obligation and opportunity to meet them with the tools they need to succeed and thrive in the current workforce and the ones to come.\u201d\nScott Kuykendall, Superintendent, Stanislaus County Office of Education: \u201cThis generation didn\u2019t just grow up with phones, they grew up inside them. The result? Fragmented attention, less depth to social connections, and rising anxiety. Part of our job in education today is to help them reclaim identity, purpose, and real connection.\u201d\nSara McMann, U.S. Olympic Silver Medalist, Gold medal coach, former UFC and Bellator fighter, Distinguished Member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame: \"Strength alone doesn\u2019t win\u2026not in combat sports, and not in life. You win when you know who you are, what you stand for, and why you do what you do. Tapping deep into who you are gives people that edge. It also gives meaning to our actions that ultimately define us\u2026With purpose comes performance.\u201d\nDennis Olympios, Co-Founder and CEO of LinkedInSuperPowers: \u201cIt\u2019s a new world. While Gen Z is the first generation to grow up with social media at their fingertips, they\u2019re also the only generation to publicize their entire lives\u2014seeking approval from countless people they\u2019ll never meet. This concept is now baked into our global culture. We no longer just live in our local communities. We have personas that have lives online. And, we ALL must learn to be proactive and purposeful with our global personas.\u201d\nGemma Mayman, VP Global ATTR Marketing at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals: \u201cTrust and connection start with two-way, honest dialogue. Be clear about expectations, but also listen, really listen to what individuals want,\u201d said Mayman. \u201cWhat drives your people? What do they need? When we understand that and show how their unique capabilities support the mission, we set people from every generation up to succeed.\u201d\nWhich brings me back to Warner Thomas\u2019 quote at the start of this post. Sure, the quote is catchy\u2014but, more importantly, it\u2019s true. There are numerous workforce challenges right now. But we won\u2019t resolve those issues by casting blame on any generation. Instead, we need to train our way out of those challenges.\nSutter Health, to their credit, isn\u2019t just talking about changing training in the hospital. They\u2019re funding it for the community. Through their community health team, Sutter has invested in initiatives to build healthier communities\u2014not just physically, but emotionally and economically. One such investment? A strategic partnership with Seity Health, an organization focused on core skills, wellbeing, and workforce readiness.\nHearing about this collaboration, I sat down with the physician founders to learn more about Seity\u2019s approach to training. In a nutshell, the company teaches young adults to understand and live by their own personal core values\u2014and in doing so, improve their soft skills, professionalism, and wellbeing.\n\u201cAs family practice/sports medicine physicians taking care of patients in diverse environments like South Central LA, elite college sports and student health at University of Texas, and now for the past two decades in an underserved rural community in the Central Valley of Northern California, one of the things we recognized is that in every environment, people need to know their why before creating sustainable change in their how\u2026\u201d said Chris Hawley, MD, CMO and Cofounder of Seity Health.\nMakes sense, I thought\u2026 then without hesitation, Sam Romeo, MD, Seity\u2019s CEO and Cofounder went on to say, \u201cWe loved when Simon Sinek reminded the world about the importance of finding our why because at that same time we were working closely with Stanislaus County Office of Education and researchers from Cal State Stanislaus to build and scientifically validate a quick way for people to discover their unique set of Core Values which IS our why\u2026Our personal Core Values are our source of meaning, purpose, and intrinsic motivation.\u201d\n\u201cBut discovering it is just the start, do you know why?\u201d asked Dr. Hawley.\nAvoiding the temptation to call out his pun, I said, \u201cDo tell.\u201d\nAnd these guys who seem to complete each other\u2019s sentences said, \u201cBecause the science is clear on this\u2026when you know who you are, build a strong self-identity, and live a value-aligned life three things happen: 1. Your wellbeing goes up, 2. Your psychological stress goes down, 3. Your performance goes up\u2026 in everything\u2026\u201d\nBoom\u2026 suddenly all the dots connected in my mind. You?\nConsider these numbers:\n- Gen Z will make up 27% of the workforce in 2025.\n- 44% report feeling persistently hopeless.\n- 74% of hiring managers say they\u2019re concerned about Gen Z\u2019s interpersonal skills.\n- 70% of hiring managers think Gen Z is not ready for work\n- 65% of Gen Z college graduates think they are not ready for the workforce\nAdd skyrocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and burnout\u2014and it becomes clear this isn\u2019t just a talent development issue. It\u2019s a public health issue.\nWhich brings us back to Sutter.\nSutter has figured out that community health isn\u2019t just about disease care and hospitals. It\u2019s about helping people\u2014especially young people\u2014build lives of meaning, contribution, and wellbeing. That\u2019s why Sutter\u2019s decision to support Seity\u2019s programming for the communities they serve isn\u2019t just smart. It\u2019s bold. It\u2019s forward-looking. And frankly, it\u2019s necessary. When I think of my own 3 Gen Z kids, I already see how they\u2019re seeking meaning, wellbeing, and connection at work.\n\u201cWe know the workforce of tomorrow is in crisis today,\u201d said Warner Thomas. \u201cIf we want better outcomes, we need better approaches. That starts with listening, discovering who people are, investing, and building together.\u201d\nAnd that seems to be what\u2019s happening in Northern California right now: a huge healthcare system, a small physician startup, and Northern California communities are coming together to solve a generational challenge\u2014not by blaming but by building.\nThere\u2019s still work to do. No single program will fix decades of disconnection. But if we want Gen Z to feel hopeful, capable, and prepared, it\u2019s going to take more than headlines and hashtags. It\u2019s going to take leadership. And, it\u2019s going to take the courage to say, \u201cWe created this issue. Let\u2019s fix it\u2014together.\u201d"

      "text": "Gen Zers Envision a Bright Future Ahead but Feel Ill-Prepared for it, New Gallup Survey Finds\nWashington, D.C., August 21, 2024-- Gallup and the Walton Family Foundation today released the Voices of Gen Z study, an annual survey designed to better understand Gen Z\u2019s unique perspectives, which reveal ambitions and challenges that are unique among this generation. This nationally representative, multiyear study of thousands of members of Gen Z between the ages of 12 and 27 gives policymakers and researchers an invaluable resource for not only understanding this generation\u2019s needs, but for making data-driven decisions to address them.\nThe findings show that Gen Zers are filled with optimism about what lies ahead, as nearly 8 in 10 Gen Zers agree they have a great future ahead of them. However, only about half (51%) feel prepared for that future.\nFor Gen Zers in middle and high school, the most important predictor of whether they feel excited about and prepared for their future is the extent to which they feel engaged at school. Nearly every measure of engagement, based on eight different criteria, declined from 2023 to 2024.\nThe largest drops were in students\u2019 being interested in and challenged by what they are learning. More than 4 in 10 Gen Z students do not agree they have learned anything interesting in the past week and over half don\u2019t have the opportunity to do schoolwork that aligns with their interests or talents.\nThe students who are most engaged in school are more than four times as likely as the least-engaged students to strongly agree they have a great future ahead of them and are 10 times more likely to strongly agree they feel prepared for the future. Students who are engaged report feeling like what they are learning in the classroom is interesting, challenging and allows them to leverage their natural talents. Importantly, 60% of Gen Z K-12 students say that when they feel most engaged with what they are learning, it is because their teacher made the topic interesting or exciting.\nThe Voices of Gen Z study also found that mental health continues to pose a challenge to many Gen Zers and is strongly correlated with overall life evaluation and the outlook on their future. Those with excellent mental health are more than three times as likely to feel prepared for their futures than those with only fair mental health, and about seven times as likely to feel prepared as those who have poor mental health.\n\u201cGen Zers are giving us the roadmap for success: stronger student-teacher bonds, more relevant learning experiences and greater exposure to career opportunities. The more we can do to realize their vision for K-12 education, the better our system will be,\u201d said Walton Family Foundation Education Program Director Romy Drucker.\nRegardless of whether Gen Zers\u2019 goals are to pursue a college education or a non-college pathway after graduation, most do not feel very prepared for their future endeavors. About one-quarter of Gen Z high school students feel they are very prepared to apply to (26%) or succeed in college (24%). Career prospects are only marginally higher: 29% of Gen Z high school students believe they will be very prepared in the future to succeed in their careers.\nThe exception to this is when middle and high school students have opportunities to learn job-related skills in school. This leads them to be more confident in their ability to succeed in the future. However, about one-third or less of students say their schools offer opportunities to learn job-related skills, practice applying or interviewing for jobs, or work on projects related to a career they may want.\nSimilarly, while more than 4 in 10 (43%) Gen Z K-12 students hope to pursue something other than college after high school, fewer than 1 in 4 have had a lot of conversations about non-college pathways such as apprenticeships and internships (23%), careers that don\u2019t require a degree (19%), or entrepreneurism (13%).\n\u201cGen Z K-12 students are feeling unprepared for their future and given only about a quarter are having meaningful conversations about non-college pathways, it\u2019s clear as to why,\u201d said Stephanie Marken, Gallup senior partner for U.S. survey research. \u201cWhile a postsecondary path makes sense for many, it\u2019s not the right path for all immediately upon high school graduation, and what we\u2019re learning from this research is that students are lacking a complete picture of the options available to them upon high school completion.\u201d\nMETHODOLOGY\nResults are based on a Gallup Panel\u2122 web survey conducted April 26-May 9, 2024, with a sample of 4,157 12- to 27-year-olds living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Gallup Panel is a probability-based panel of U.S. adults who are randomly selected using address-based sampling methodology. Gallup also recruits using random\u2011digit-dial phone interviews that cover landline and cellphones.\nWithin the overall sample, 2,364 12- to 19-year-old children were reached through adult members of the Gallup Panel who indicated they had at least one child 18 or younger living in their household; Panel members whose child completed the survey in 2023 were asked to have the same child complete the survey again, even if they were 19 years old. The remaining 1,793 18- to 27-year-old respondents are members of the Gallup Panel.\nFor the total sample of 4,157 Gen Z respondents, the margin of sampling error is +/-2.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. For the sample of 2,317 children still enrolled in K-12 school, the margin of sampling error is +/-2.7 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. For the sample of 1,840 Gen Z youth who are no longer enrolled in K-12 school, the margin of sampling error is +/-3.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. Margins of error for subgroups are higher.\nAll reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.\nAbout the Walton Family Foundation\nThe Walton Family Foundation is, at its core, a family-led foundation.

      "text": "Elise Monsanto plans to get around to some of the \"grown-up\" milestones that generally mark early adulthood; she's just not in a rush. She didn't get her driver's license until she was 20. She and her friends still haven't had their first boyfriends. Now, at 22, she doesn't drink, though she's sure at some point she will. \"I think it's more of a hesitancy thing, a little bit scared to start,\" she told me. \"I guess the same thing with driving.\"\nLike a lot of people in Gen Z, she doesn't feel like there's a need to hustle into adulting. \"There's no urgency,\" she said. \"Even people I see graduating, I'm like, 'Oh, there's no urgency to look for a job or look for a place.' They're kind of OK with being like, 'Oh, I'll just figure it out when it comes along.'\"\nThere's been a lot of chatter, culturally, about things Gen Z isn't doing. As the narrative goes, they're not drinking or driving or working or really taking risks. But the reality is more complicated. Gen Z isn't foregoing typical adult activities \u2014 most will eventually launch their careers or wind up getting married \u2014 but they're taking their time. They're following a pattern of people living life more slowly. Their parents nurtured and supervised them more, meaning they're sluggish to adapt to adulthood's lack of supervision. They're also staring down an economy where a lot of elements are sort of stuck in place. Many aren't in a hurry, but even if they were, it's hard to get moving.\nGen Z is becoming the Take-It-Slow Generation.\nIn casual conversations with people in the alcohol industry, one thing I sometimes hear is that they don't necessarily buy into all the headlines that Gen Z isn't really drinking. They're obviously self-interested, but they're not sure Gen Z is some special sober generation that will buck the trend of everyone who came before. Yes, Gen Z is drinking less right out of the gate than other generations \u2014 underage drinking rates have declined steadily in recent decades. When they do hit the kosher age threshold, young people aren't jumping in headfirst. But there are some signs that Gen Zers will eventually revert to the American norm as they develop a relationship with alcohol. Some older members of the generation, who are hitting their mid-20s, are starting to look pretty similar to millennials or Gen Xers when it comes to the amount of booze they consume.\n\"These are students that did not have a regular college experience because of COVID, and also social media is a bigger part of their lives so far,\" Nadine Sarwat, an analyst who covers beverages and cannabis at Bernstein, told me in an interview earlier this year. \"The data indicates that once those people turn 24, 25 and enter full working adulthood, they're sort of consuming like previous people would at that age.\"\nDrinking is a function of both economic and social forces, and Gen Z is playing catch-up on both fronts. Essentially, 25 is the new 21.\nWithout open positions, Gen Z workers have not moved into the workforce.Add source (optional)\nIt's not just cultural signifiers where Gen Z is behind the curve. An analysis from Pew Research Center found that in 2021, 21-year-olds in the US also financially lagged far behind people of the same age in 1980. They're much less likely to have a full-time job or fully support themselves financially. But here, too, the younger generation is making up ground: By the time they're 25, today's young people look similar to 21-year-olds in the 1980s and are caught up with 25-year-olds of that era. In the US Census Bureau's 2021 American Community Survey, about two-thirds of 25-year-olds said they had full-time work, like 21-year-olds in 1980 and only slightly behind 25-year-olds at that time. Six in 10 said they were on their own financially, which is actually ahead of 21-year-olds in 1980 and in line with 25-year-olds of the time.\n\"On the economic milestones, you can sort of say that 25 is the new 21,\" said Richard Fry, a senior researcher focusing on economics and education at Pew Research Center. \"They really do ramp up.\"\nFry said education may be partially responsible for this shift \u2014 people are waiting to get their first full-time gigs until they're finished with their education, and they're focusing on their studies instead of picking up part-time jobs along the way. Almost half of 21-year-olds were enrolled in college as of 2021, Fry said, while back in 1980, it was only three in 10. \"Clearly, schooling and college are a more important endeavor for young adults today than they were 40, 45 years ago,\" Fry told me. There are some variations by gender \u2014 young women are caught up with their 1980s counterparts, while young men, particularly those without a college education, lag behind.\nOn either side of the college experience, Gen Zers are also hanging back from the workforce. On the younger end, teens aren't taking that first job that will propel them into adulthood. The proportion of teens working or looking for work has been declining for decades. In 1980, about 55% of people ages 16 to 19 were participating in the labor force. Today, that number is closer to 38%. On the postgrad side, the share of people in their early 20s in the workforce has declined over the past decade, Nicholas Tremper, an economist at Gusto, a human resources platform, said in an email. Because older workers are sticking around, they're becoming a bigger share of the workforce \u2014 and making it harder for younger workers to elbow their way in.\n\"The primary way workers advance in their careers is through job mobility, which opens up positions for others who are entering the workforce,\" he said. \"Without open positions, Gen Z workers have not moved into the workforce.\"\nOn nonfinancial, more emotional adult milestones, such as getting married and having kids, Gen Z is following a long-term trend of people putting off such events until later in life. The number of people getting married and having kids by 24 has collapsed. The median age of a person's first marriage has gone from 25 and 22 for men and women, respectively, in 1980 to 27 and 25 in 2000 and 30 and 29 in 2024, the most recent year for which data is available, according to the Census Bureau. People are beginning to have children later in life, too, and even putting off the littler things, such as driving.\nAveyshla Jimenez, a 25-year-old publicist in Miami, told me she used to idealize what her current age would look like \u2014 a house, marriage. Instead, she's still getting settled in her career. \"It's not necessarily that I don't want to be traditional. It doesn't seem realistic,\" she said. \"It seems like I just entered the workforce.\" She started working as a teenager and can't imagine what it feels like for others who are behind her in terms of job experience. \"I don't expect everyone to have worked as a server until 6 a.m., so if I'm not where I want to be, I can't imagine other people my age,\" she said.\nOne of the reasons that Gen Z feels less pressure to jump into these life experiences is fairly straightforward, said Jean Twenge, a psychologist and the author of \"Generations: The Real Differences Between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers, and Silents \u2014 and What They Mean for America's Future.\" Young people nowadays simply have more time to live than their predecessors.\n\"Psychologists call this a slow life strategy, and it happens when people live longer,\" Twenge told me.\nAs life expectancies have crept higher, and people have started to get used to those longer lifespans, they are moving through life at a decelerated pace. Teens are putting off dating and driving, young adults are settling into families and careers later, and middle-aged people look and feel younger than their grandparents did at their age. \"It starts in the '90s, but it's kind of slow, and then it gets going through the 2000s and then really accelerates in the 2010s once you transition to Gen Z,\" she said.\nGen Z doesn't have these new attitudes only because they feel they have all the time in the world to grow up. They're also being raised differently, with more attention and, some would say, coddling. As parents have fewer children and later in life, they nurture them more carefully, which, in turn, delays independence. Gen Z has been under more adult supervision than previous generations \u2014 their playdates were carefully watched; their parents have monitored their whereabouts on their phones \u2014 which may be safer but means they're not figuring things out on their own.\n\"Parents are more hesitant. They are less comfortable allowing their children to be uncomfortable,\" Haley Stephens, a pediatric psychologist at UVA Children's Hospital, said. Confidence and skills such as problem-solving and conflict resolution are born from discomfort, which parents and schools increasingly shield children and teens from. This has some good effects \u2014 young people are cultured and sensitive and aware of what's going on in the world. It's a positive that they're not drinking and are avoiding what are generally considered negative outcomes, such as teen pregnancy. But it also means they're having a hard time fully leaving the nest and are more anxious.\nEvery generation gets pinned with a stereotype, and everyone takes their turn at diagnosing the \"problem with the kids these days.\"Add source (optional)\nTechnology, of course, plays a role. Young people spending so much time on the phone makes face-to-face interaction rarer, meaning they're slower to develop that muscle. They avoid driving not just because it's scary but also because the party is on Snapchat or TikTok anyway. They're good at setting boundaries at work to protect their mental and physical health, but they may boundary so hard that their boss starts to wonder whether they can handle the day-to-day of the job.\nJessica Lautz, the deputy chief economist and vice president of research at the National Association of Realtors, said this hesitancy to take the full leap is showing up in the housing market. While people 18 to 25 are just a small slice of homebuyers, when they do take the plunge, they do so closer to their families. \"If we looked at Gen Xers, we would see they do not want to be close to home, for instance,\" she said. \"But for young millennials and Gen Zers, this does seem to be much more important for them.\"\nLenny Zaleski, a 22-year-old senior at the University of Dayton, plans to move back in with his family in Chicago after he graduates from college in the spring and starts his full-time job. It sounds \"crazy to say out loud,\" he told me, and isn't what he thought would happen, but it makes sense, given skyrocketing rents. \"If homes are out of the affordability range and a studio apartment in the city your job is in is $2,000 a month, at a certain point, you can't just bootstrap that,\" he said. He acknowledged that living with his family is a pretty decent lifestyle. His grandparents are in the area, as is his dog, and it will let him save up for when he's ready to strike out on his own. And when he does buy, he plans to do so nearby.\nWriting about young people always has a sort of old-man-yells-at-cloud bent to it. Every generation gets pinned with a stereotype, and everyone takes their turn at diagnosing the \"problem with the kids these days.\" I'm a millennial, and all we got to hear about is how our avocado toast habit locked us out of the housing market \u2014 not, you know, a global recession and a real estate meltdown. But just as millennials are somewhat begrudgingly aging into their parents and grandparents, Gen Z is also coming around to the grown-up thing. It's just taking them a smidge longer to get there.\nThere is no \"right\" way to age, but much of America is stuck thinking that baby boomers should be the mold. As mentioned, younger people across generations are just moving through life a little more slowly. They're also aging into a very different world from that of someone in, say, the '80s. Technology is much more prevalent. The economy is more unequal. The world feels pretty unsteady.\nTake, for example, the workplace. Managers and companies have launched all sorts of complaints that Gen Z seems ill-prepared and immature at their jobs. This may be true of many young workers, but it's not necessarily their fault. Many businesses have done away with robust on-the-job training, meaning entry-level workers are left to fend for themselves.\n\"The boomers entered the workplace with robust training and development programs and clear career ladders, things that organizations have dismantled over the years to save money,\" said Kenneth Matos, the director of market insights at HiBob, an HR-tech company. \"In such an environment, I would expect people to 'grow up slower' because opportunities are fewer.\"\nGrant Dutro, a 22-year-old senior from Wheaton College, told me he thinks there's a level of \"safetyism\" in his generation. \"There are people that it is taking a little bit longer to launch,\" he said. Some of his peers' parents have tracked them on Life360, especially when they were younger. He started driving at 16, but he's got friends who didn't get their licenses until much later \u2014 he even taught one to parallel park. The type of stuff the psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes in his book \"The Anxious Generation,\" Dutro said, may be \"holding people back\" in his age cohort. Like any generation, Gen Z is not a monolith, he said, but \"my generation really grew up with a smartphone in hand, and I do think that has had a big impact, because why go out and see people when you can stay in?\"\nThere's a temptation to put a value judgment on what Gen Z is and isn't doing. No underage drinking: good. No working: bad. But the reality is more complicated. When you put things into those two opposing buckets, you miss the bigger picture and what's contributing to it. Parenting, schooling, and working are different now, as is society as a whole. To expect Gen Z to do everything at the same pace as previous generations wouldn't make sense. Sure, maybe 25 is the new 21, but just because Gen Z is taking longer to hit some benchmarks doesn't mean that they'll be duds as adults.\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.\nBusiness Insider's Discourse stories provide perspectives on the day's most pressing issues, informed by analysis, reporting, and expertise."

      "text": "Snakes and Ladders (Chutes and Ladders for American readers) was the game I grew up with. A roll of the dice could catapult you up or send you sliding down. One lucky number and you were ahead. One unlucky square and you were back at the beginning. It was a game of chance\u2014no strategy, no control.\nMy Gen Z kids don\u2019t play it. Their world is Minecraft. They build. They create. They engineer landscapes from scratch. There\u2019s no dice. No shortcuts. Just trial, design and iteration. And that contrast says a lot about how Gen Z thinks about careers too. They don\u2019t want to climb someone else\u2019s ladder.\nThey want to craft their own space, shape their own path and know that the work they do today builds toward something that\u2019s theirs. But that\u2019s hard to do when the systems they enter are still wired for a different game. If we want to help Gen Z grow, we can\u2019t leave it to luck. We have to help them build.\nIt makes you wonder: is there a Minecraft: Career Edition?\nEven if there were, we\u2019d still need to name the gap between building virtual worlds and navigating real ones. One lets you break blocks and build castles with a click. The other requires you to face uncertainty, figure out what matters, and make calls when no playbook is handed to you.\nCareers don\u2019t come with a tutorial. There\u2019s no sandbox mode for real life.\nThat\u2019s what makes early career so complicated right now. Gen Z is often learning through simulations, digital experiences and secondhand stories. But what they need are real-world repetitions. Moments of stretch, ambiguity and contribution. Not in theory. In context. In the workplace. On teams that expect something of them.\nAnd that means leaders need to stop asking if Gen Z is prepared\u2014and start creating the conditions that help them prepare.\nTrying To Build With Missing Blocks\nMany young professionals are ambitious, creative and eager to grow\u2014but they\u2019re also navigating fog. Career guidance feels out of sync with what they\u2019re experiencing. The job they trained for might be evolving. The path they imagined might not exist. And the advice they\u2019re getting often comes from influencers, not insiders.\nCareerTok is full of well-meaning guidance, but much of it misses a deeper truth: growth isn\u2019t a formula. And belief in yourself, while important, needs to be anchored in something more durable than algorithms, AI prompts or viral social media tips.\nA Deloitte study found that just 6% of Gen Z say their top career goal is to reach a leadership role. But that doesn\u2019t mean they lack ambition. Learning and development rank among their top three reasons for choosing an employer. Nearly nine in ten say a sense of purpose is critical to their well-being. And many feel their managers are falling short\u2014not on performance management, but on inspiration and mentorship.\nGallup research reveals similar gaps. Younger employees report drops in clarity, recognition, and development\u2014fundamental ingredients for growth. These aren\u2019t soft needs. They\u2019re the scaffolding for long-term success.\nThe biggest challenge? Most of our systems still reward the straight line. But Gen Z grew up in a world that glitched and rebooted. They\u2019ve watched careers evaporate, industries reinvent, and skills go obsolete before graduation. They aren\u2019t lost. They\u2019re living in a different context. One that doesn\u2019t promise certainty\u2014but does demand adaptability.\nAnd they\u2019re not waiting to be told what to do. They\u2019re asking the right questions:\nWhat am I building here?\nWhat matters to me?\nHow can I grow and still be myself?\nWhat Leaders Must Do\nMany leaders still expect younger employees to prove themselves the same way they did: stay put, follow instructions, pay dues. But Gen Z is responding to a different economy and different signals. They want growth, not grind. They want learning, not ladder-climbing for its own sake. And they want to feel seen as whole people, not just future high potentials.\nSo what should leaders do?\n1. See Strengths Before Gaps\nMost young professionals are used to being evaluated on what they lack. Flip the script. Start with what they naturally do best. Help them understand their true strengths not bemoan their weaknesses. Help them see how they think, relate and contribute. You\u2019re not just coaching a job. You\u2019re shaping a personal journey.\n2. Design for Experience\nGen Z doesn\u2019t expect to have all the answers. But they want chances to explore. That means offering project work across teams, learning experiences outside their job family and mentorship that spans disciplines.\n3. Share Real Stories\nMany leaders hide the zigzags in their own careers. That\u2019s a missed opportunity. Share your detours. Your failures. The moments that didn\u2019t make sense until later. Gen Z wants transparency over polish. Vulnerability builds trust.\n4. Be a Guide, Not a Gatekeeper\nInstead of asking, \u201cWhere do you want to be in five years?\u201d try, \u201cWhat kind of work makes you feel alive?\u201d or \u201cWhat problems are you curious about?\u201d Let their questions shape the path, not your expectations.\n5. Normalize the Reset\nA role that doesn\u2019t fit isn\u2019t failure. It\u2019s data. Help them see how skills transfer, how to reframe setbacks and how to pivot without shame. Especially in a fast-moving world where AI and automation are redrawing the lines every week.\nFrom Ladders To Landscapes\nMany Gen Z employees are being called idealistic. Entitled. Too quick to leave. But they are not quitting growth. They are quitting environments that don\u2019t make space for it. The sooner we adjust our systems, the sooner we unlock their potential.\nBecause they\u2019re not playing the old game. If their world is more Minecraft than Monopoly, our systems need to shift too. Minecraft doesn\u2019t reward luck or hierarchy. It rewards intention. Curiosity. Rebuilding when something breaks. Careers today need the same mindset. Not a fixed track but an evolving world built through trial, stretch, and imagination.\nYou don\u2019t build a castle in Minecraft by rolling dice. You build it block by block\u2014mistake by mistake, lesson by lesson. That\u2019s the kind of resilience and creativity Gen Z is already practicing. And it\u2019s time we helped them bring it into the workplace.\nThe game Gen Z is playing isn\u2019t about reaching the top. It\u2019s about learning how to move with change. How to build range. And how to grow in ways that matter. The leaders who will shape the future are the ones who know this. And who are willing to change the gameboard."
