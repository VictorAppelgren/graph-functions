      "feedback": "The draft is a solid attempt to braid tariff policy, Fed stance, and consumer-cost signals, but it needs a tighter, more quantitative, and clearly structured world‑class frame for a 0–3 week horizon. Actionable edits: 1) Reframe into a crisp three‑section flow: (a) immediate drivers and policy backdrop with explicit numeric anchors (tariff share rising above 10% of imports; June trade deficit around $692 billion; export/Import ratio seen at roughly 37% YTD vs a long‑run ~39–40%), (b) near‑term catalysts and positioning (June trade data releases; tariff announcements/resolutions; Lagarde/Fed signals around rate cuts; Jackson Hole commentary) with concrete trigger events, and (c) reaction function and monitoring parametrics (anticipated asset price moves, credit/lending dynamics, and what would invalidate the view). 2) Strengthen the causal chain with first‑principles clarity: tariffs push importing costs into consumer prices and capital goods; pass‑through is asymmetric across sectors (autos show mixed signals but some producers are still passing costs to buyers, per S15934PBQ), which then feeds inflation risk and shapes Fed policy; connect Lagarde’s independence and Powell’s rate‑path guidance to the credibility channel and market pricing. 3) Quantify where possible using only source IDs: cite 0J41Q7KTX for the tariff spike, record trade deficit, and the Fed cut expectation; cite S15934PBQ for auto‑industry pass‑through nuances; cite CDBMWIUTB for the 6.43% average car loan and the negative equity dynamic; cite U6HXAJR4J for independence framing; cite 6OOEK8TUR for consumer‑spending pressure signals from Vegas; ensure every factual claim carries a parenthetical citation to the correct ID. 4) Build a concise, explicit invalidation checklist: if inflation remains markedly price/sticky or if tariff escalations prompt a stronger‑than‑expected inflation surprise, the 0–3 week drift to a dovish cut would be challenged; if tariff uncertainty resolves or pass‑through proves weaker than anticipated, the near‑term easing path would sharpen; note these as clear triggers tied to sources. 5) Reconcile conflicts transparently: acknowledge mixed signals on auto pricing (Nikkei/JP peers vs. automaker denials) and quote both sides with citations to maintain balance (e.g., Nikkei Asia vs. automaker statements) so readers understand uncertainty rather than a one‑sided view. 6) Tighten scope and tone to a concise, scannable briefing rather than a narrative essay; eliminate peripheral items (e.g., non‑essential Vegas anecdotes) unless they sharpen the 0–3 week read, and place all numeric anchors near the relevant claims. 7) Elevate the monitoring list to a short, concrete “watch next” set: upcoming June trade data, any tariff updates, Fed communications, and any credible inflation readings that could tilt policy; map each to a source ID. 8) Ensure the final piece clearly labels the horizon, states key levels/thresholds, and marks the invalidation point so readers can judge the reaction function immediately. This will improve depth, discipline, and credibility while preserving alignment with SECTION FOCUS and the required 0–3 week horizon.",
