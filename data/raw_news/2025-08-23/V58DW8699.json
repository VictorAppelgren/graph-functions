  "description": "The board of SSC Security Services Corp. ( CVE:SECU ) has announced that it will pay a dividend of CA$0.03 per share on...",
  "content": "The board of SSC Security Services Corp. (CVE:SECU) has announced that it will pay a dividend of CA$0.03 per share on the 15th of October. This makes the dividend yield 4.7%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nSSC Security Services' Distributions May Be Difficult To Sustain\n\nIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. SSC Security Services isn't generating any profits, and it is paying out a very high proportion of the cash it is earning. These payout levels would generally be quite difficult to keep up.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share could 27.4% over the next year if the trend of the last few years can't be broken. This will push the company into unprofitability, which means the managers will have to choose between suspending the dividend, or paying it out of cash reserves.\n\nIt is great to see that SSC Security Services has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now, however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. The last annual payment of CA$0.12 was flat on the annual payment from9 years ago. SSC Security Services hasn't been paying a dividend for very long, so we wouldn't get to excited about its record of growth just yet.\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, things aren't all that rosy. SSC Security Services' EPS has fallen by approximately 27% per year during the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future.\n\nWe're Not Big Fans Of SSC Security Services' Dividend\n\nIn summary, while it is good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we think that at current levels the payment isn't particularly sustainable. The company's earnings aren't high enough to be making such big distributions, and it isn't backed up by strong growth or consistency either. Overall, this doesn't get us very excited from an income standpoint.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, SSC Security Services has 3 warning signs (and 2 which are a bit unpleasant) we think you should know about. Is SSC Security Services not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

  "argos_summary": "SSC Security Services Corp. (SECU) will pay a CA$0.03 dividend on October 15, 2025, giving a 4.7% yield, but the payout is not sustainable because the company is unprofitable and has a high cash payout ratio of 185%.  SECU\u2019s earnings per share have been falling, and its dividend has not increased in nine years, raising concerns about future payments.  The stock has underperformed the Canadian market and commercial services sector, with a 5\u2011year decline of nearly 48% and a weak valuation score of 2/6.  Investors should weigh the attractive yield against the company\u2019s weak financial health and limited growth prospects.",
