  "content": "A Florida county official is accused of fatally drugging his grandfather while the elderly man was in hospice care \u2014 then forging paperwork to snatch his house, according to authorities.\n\nChristopher Michael Balter, 35, was arrested last Sunday, months after he allegedly confessed to a childhood friend that he \u201ckilled\u201d his grandfather, Gilbert Balter, with prescription meds at their shared Palm Bay home, according to his arrest affidavit obtained by The Post.\n\nThe friend told cops that the younger Balter, the director of Planning and Development for Indian River County, texted her on Feb. 1 to say his grandfather had passed away while in hospice care, authorities said.\n\nWhen she called to check on him, the friend said Balter chillingly admitted from a sushi restaurant that he killed his grandfather using his own prescription narcotic Ambien pills, the affidavit said.\n\nBalter further told his friend that his grandfather, who was in his 90s, was in a \u201cvegetative\u201d state and hadn\u2019t moved or spoken in four days \u2014 noting a cremation for him was already arranged and no evidence would be left behind, the document said.\n\nThe woman initially held off reporting the call, fearing retaliation from Balter due to his role in Indian River County and ties to Palm Bay police personnel, records showed.\n\nBut a few days later, she detailed the chilling call to Palm Bay Police, who asked her to make a recorded call with Balter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous about what you said about grandpa,\u201d she said over the phone, according to call transcripts.\n\n\u201cOK, people do that all the time to help people out,\u201d Balter allegedly replied. \u201cThat is what hospice is. They load them full of f\u2013ing pain meds and ease their way out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him, I helped him out,\u201d he then allegedly said.\n\nThe friend also asked Balter if he was drinking when he called her, as he had a drinking problem and a whopping three DUIs on his record, authorities added.\n\nBalter allegedly replied to the question with \u201cNo! Why are you freaking out?\u201d\n\nA medical examiner later confirmed the grandfather had been given Ambien \u2014 a drug not prescribed to him \u2014 and that a cocktail of morphine, zolpidem (Ambien), and Lorazepam toxicity could not be ruled out as \u201ccontributory to his death,\u201d Click Orlando reported.\n\nPrescribed Ambien tablets were found among the local official\u2019s prescriptions, the affidavit said.\n\nA quit claim deed to give Balter his grandfather\u2019s home was also found by detectives with his childhood friend\u2019s signature as a witness.\n\nThe friend then said she did not recognize the document, and police determined Balter had forged her signature.\n\nBalter faces charges of delivery of a controlled substance and forgery.\n\nHe has since been freed on bond.",

      "text": "NYC designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s tragic death on Montauk boat eyed as suspected accidental drug overdose: sources\nThe mysterious death of Manhattan swimwear designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra at the upscale Montauk Yacht Club is being eyed as a possible accidental overdose, sources said Tuesday.\nThe 33-year-old Irish beauty was found unconscious at the ritzy club at around midnight on Aug. 5 aboard a boat named \u201cRipple\u201d \u2013 one of at least two Grateful Dead-themed crafts owned by insurance mogul Christopher Durnan, sources tell The Post.\nAn autopsy is pending to determine Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s official cause of death \u2013 although sources said it was a suspected drug overdose.\nQuestions have been swirling since the tragic night when Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra was discovered on the \u201cRipple,\u201d which was docked at the Yacht Club. Members reported hearing screams and called 911, before trying to resuscitate the young designer \u2013 who was later pronounced dead.\nThe good Samaritans told The Post they were woken by a naked man throwing sunscreen at their boat and saw him running down the dock screaming, \u201cDo something!\u201d\nDurnan, 60, a familiar figure at the club, owns the Durnan Group in Rockville Center, which manages the \u201clargest, most successful Workers Compensation Safety Group for Real Estate\u201d on the company\u2019s website.\nHe owns \u201cRipple\u201d and a second boat, \u201cHell in a Bucket,\u201d which was docked alongside and is also a shout-out to the Grateful Dead, several club members confirmed.\nDurnan did not return several requests for comment.\nSuffolk County cops have not filed charges or identified any suspects in the case. But authorities have also not publicly ruled out foul play, despite revealing that there was no evidence of violence to the body.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s death is also being investigated by Suffolk County\u2019s East End Drug Task Force, according to a Tuesday report by Newsday.\n\u201cUntil you start ruling stuff out, everything is in play,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation told the outlet.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra, a native of the tiny Irish town of Carlow, migrated to the US, where she started as a bottle service girl in SoHo before co-founding East x East, a swimwear label.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Irish Independent last year.\nHer partner in the East x East, Dylan Grace, posted a moving tribute on Instagram following her death.\n\u201cWe dreamed big together, laughed harder than anyone else could understand and built so much from nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed and grateful to have had you in my life.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra summered in the Hamptons, where she hosted successful pop-up shows and fashion exhibits for wealthy clientele in Montauk and the surrounding area.\nShe had finalized her divorce to ex-Sam Ryan just months before her death, according to court records reviewed by The Post.\n\u201cI represented Mr. Ryan in a matrimonial proceeding. The final papers had been submitted to the court, and before the Judgment of Divorce was issued, I became aware of Ms. Nolan-O\u2019slatarra\u2019s passing and promptly notified the court,\u201d his attorney, David Centeno, said in a statement. \u201cOut of respect for the privacy of those involved and my ethical restraints, I cannot discuss whether there was a prenuptial agreement, mediation, or other private arrangements.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s heartbroken mother, Elma Nolan, told the Irish Independent on Aug. 7 that her daughter was planning a trip home to Carlow before her death.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to my daughter,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI feel numb and in shock.\u201d\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Brandon Cruz, Joe Marino and Peter Senzamici"

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger whines about being kept up at night by \u2018relentless\u2019 inmate taunts at maximum security lockup: report\nConvicted killer Bryan Kohberger has whined that he\u2019s \u201cextremely annoyed\u201d and losing sleep at the maximum security prison he now calls home \u2014 thanks to fellow inmates who constantly yell through vents into his cell in a \u201crelentless\u201d taunting campaign, according to a report.\nKohberger, who was hit with four life sentences last month for slaying four University of Idaho students, was transferred from jail to the only maximum security prison in the state and is now being held there in solitary confinement.\nAnd the prisoners at Kohberger\u2019s new digs at Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Kuna have had it out for the convicted criminology student \u2014 taking turns shouting into the vent that leads into his cell most hours of the day, a law enforcement source told the Daily Mail.\nKohberger, 28, has made multiple complaints to prison guards that he\u2019s been unable to sleep, according to Chris McDonough, a retired homicide detective who works for the Cold Case Foundation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s driving him crazy,\u201d McDonough told the outlet. \u201cThe inmates are tormenting him at night and almost all hours of the day \u2014 taunting him through the vents in his cell.\u201d\n\u201cThey are literally getting up into the grate and yelling at him. The inmates are taking turns doing it. It\u2019s relentless,\u201d McDonough continued. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely annoyed and frustrated. He\u2019s complaining to the authorities that he can\u2019t sleep because of them.\u201d\nKohberger is being housed in the prison\u2019s restricted unit in the facility\u2019s J block, away from the general prison population.\nHe\u2019s kept in a cell by himself at all times, except for one-hour a day when he\u2019s let into \u201cthe cage\u201d outside for recreation, while he wears restraints. And he\u2019s only allotted one shower every other day.\nThe high-profile nature of Kohberger\u2019s case and the fact he copped to such abhorrent crimes makes him a target for other inmates who would want to harm him \u201cjust to make a name for themselves,\u201d McDonough explained.\nAnd since the other inmates don\u2019t pose a physical threat to Kohberger while he\u2019s in solitary, prison staff aren\u2019t likely to intervene, the former cop said.\nStill, as attention moves away from Kohberger over time, prison staff may eventually be willing to move him back to the general population, McDonough explained.\nAt the jail that Kohberger was previously kept in while he awaited trial, other defendants said he did unusual things like spending hours on the phone with his mom MaryAnn, washing his hands compulsively, taking showers upwards of an hour long and staying awake at night only to nap during the day.\nOnce, he confronted another defendant who yelled \u201cyou suck\u201d at a sports player on the TV because he thought the man was insulting Kohberger and his mom as they spoke on the phone.\nLast month, Kohberger took a surprise plea deal just weeks before his highly anticipated trial was set to kick off. The deal saw him skirt the possibility of facing the death penalty, enraging some of the families of his victims and leaving loved ones with no explanation for why he committed the heinous murders.\nHe admitted to killing Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022 in their off-campus house in Moscow."

      "text": "PALM BAY, Fla. \u2013 A 35-year-old man is accused of killing his grandfather, who was in hospice care, by giving him prescription medication, according to an affidavit for arrest warrant.\nChristopher Michael Balter, 35, was arrested on Aug. 3, months after the death of his grandfather.\nRecommended Videos\nAccording to an affidavit for arrest warrant, a childhood friend of Balter reported on Feb. 3 to Palm Bay police that he had texted her that his grandfather passed away. She told police that Balter\u2019s grandfather was in his 90s and in hospice care. He lived with his grandfather in Palm Bay.\nThe friend then called Balter to make sure he was OK and while on the phone, she said he told her that he had \u201ckilled\u201d his grandfather by giving him Balter\u2019s own prescription medication, the affidavit reads.\nHe then told her that his grandfather was about to be cremated, so there would be no evidence of that happening, according to the affidavit. He explained to her that his grandfather had been in a \u201cvegetative\u201d state and had not moved or spoken in four days.\nShe told police she was scared of reporting the call as Balter was currently the director of Planning and Development for Indian River County. His current status with the county is not known.\nPolice then had her call Balter and put him on speaker phone so it could be recorded by officers. During the phone call, the two argued about the death of Balter\u2019s grandfather, the affidavit said.\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous about what you said about grandpa,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOK, people do that all the time to help people out. That is what hospice is. They load them full of f***ing pain meds and ease their way out,\u201d Balter replies, according to the affidavit.\nShe told him that he had told her he killed his grandfather, and he replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him. I helped him out,\u201d the affidavit reads.\nPolice confirmed with an autopsy that the grandfather had been given Ambien, which was not one of his prescriptions, and that the \u201ccombination of morphine, zolpidem (Ambien) and Lorazepam toxicity cannot be ruled out as contributory to the death,\u201d according to the medical examiner.\nDetectives also located a quit claim deed that had the childhood friend\u2019s signature as a witness. She told police she had never signed the document, and police determined Balter had forged her signature, according to the affidavit. The deed was for his grandfather\u2019s home.\nBalter faces charges of delivery of a controlled substance and forgery. He has since bonded out of jail."
