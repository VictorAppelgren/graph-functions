  "description": "When it comes to Legionnaires' disease, this doctor explains how buildings can prevent it and what symptoms to watch for an early diagnosis.",
  "content": "The Legionnaires' disease outbreak in New York City is now blamed for another death and continues to spread. Three people have died and at least 64 others have gotten sick since the outbreak was first reported on July 25.\n\nCBS News New York spoke with one doctor who explained anyone can be diagnosed with the disease, and some people are more at risk.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there's nothing that one can do to prevent it if it is around and you're breathing it in,\" said Dr. Aaron Glatt, Chair of Medicine and Chief of Infectious Diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital. \"However, fortunately, most people don't get it, and, fortunately, most people, if they do get it, don't get extremely sick from it.\n\n\"But people that are at higher risk -- people that have underlying lung diseases, people who have other medical problems -- they can be much more susceptible to serious Legionnaires' disease.\"\n\nWhat's Legionnaires' disease and how to prevent it?\n\nLegionnaires' doesn't spread from person to person or from drinking water, but it can be inhaled through mist in the air.\n\nIt's caused by a bacteria, known as the species Legionella pneumophila. NYC health officials say this outbreak was traced to 11 buildings in Central Harlem with contaminated cooling towers.\n\n\"These large air conditioning systems, they sometimes can have Legionella growing inside of them. There is a special maintenance that each of these facilities uses and does on a regular bases, they prevent the colonization of their water systems with Legionella, but sometimes, even despite the best maintenance, this can still be a problem,\" Dr. Glatt explained.\n\n\"For most people, this isn't a problem. It's only these large systems where they have special cooling with water as part of the centralized air conditioning system,\" he added. \"So a person with their own private system, this isn't the problem. And, usually, it's not a problem even in these large systems because they're maintained properly.\"\n\nActing Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said Tuesday crews are working to test and clean the towers, and the city has launched a public awareness campaign in the area.\n\n\"Unfortunately, until that's done, there can be aerosolization with the water in the air, and people who are walking nearby can, unfortunately, get infected by that method,\" said Dr. Glatt.\n\nLegionnaires' is a severe form of pneumonia, and health officials urge people to look out for any flulike symptoms. Glatt says the top two are shortness of breath or a cough.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, like emphysema, COPD or severe cases of asthma, and people with other major medical conditions or who are of older age will be at higher risk.\n\n\"The good news is if it is diagnosed early, then there are good antibiotic treatments that one can take that can mitigate or really make the disease not usually a fatal disease,\" Dr. Glatt said. \"But again, in some people, it will be a serious infection.\"\n\nCLICK HERE for more information about Legionnaires' disease from the New York City Department of Health.",

Legionnaires\u2019 disease causes flu-like symptoms, and complications from the disease can be fatal.\nPeople who inhale mist that contains Legionella bacteria can get sick. Sources of water with Legionella contamination may include cooling towers, showers and hot tubs.

You may also have headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion or diarrhea.\nIf you have these symptoms, seek medical attention right away. You are especially at risk if you are a smoker or have a medical condition that affects your breathing. Tell your health care provider you are worried about Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\nThere is no vaccine or medicine that can prevent Legionnaires\u2019 disease. The best way to prevent it is through the proper maintenance of water systems where Legionella may grow.\nIn NYC, building owners are required to register cooling towers. They also need to routinely test the water for the presence of Legionella. You can look up results of Health Department inspections of cooling tower systems by building address or building identification number (BIN).\nThe Health Department investigates clusters of Legionnaires\u2019 disease cases to find the source of the contamination in order to prevent other people from getting sick. When two or more confirmed cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease within a 12-month period are associated with the same building with a shared hot water system, the Health Department will conduct a building evaluation."

Here's what to know about the symptoms.\nThere has been a third death in the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in New York City.\nOfficials said the number of cases has grown to 67, including those three deaths.\nLegionnaires' is a severe form of pneumonia that doesn't spread from person to person, but can be inhaled through mist in the air.\nThe city's health department is now warning New Yorkers to be on the lookout for any flulike symptoms.\n\"We are extremely concerned and paying attention and taking action about this cluster of Legionnaires' cases,\" Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said.\nLegionnaires' disease outbreak in Harlem\nOfficials say 67 people have been diagnosed since July 25, and at least 21 cases were serious enough to lead to hospitalization.\nThe outbreak is mostly contained to five zip codes across Central Harlem: 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037 and 10039.\nIf you live in one of the zones and develop flulike symptoms, contact a health care provider immediately, especially if you're at higher risk, including those ages 50 and older and cigarette smokers.\nCity officials believe the likely source of the Legionella pneumophila bacteria causing the outbreak came from cooling towers in the affected communities. They ordered testing to be done and say the 11 that came back positive have all completed the remediation process.\n\"We are doing everything we can to urgently both test and clean the cooling towers that we think are the source of this Legionella exposure,\" Morse said.\nCooling towers are part of large air conditioning systems for apartment complexes and other large buildings.\n\"They sometimes can have Legionella growing inside of them. There is a special maintenance that each of these facilities uses and does on a regular bases, they prevent the colonization of their water systems with Legionella, but sometimes, even despite the best maintenance, this can still be a problem,\" said Dr. Aaron Glatt, Chair of Medicine and Chief of Infectious Diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital.\n\"It's not just the cooling towers\"\nApril McIver leads the Plumbing Foundation City of New York, which is backing a City Council bill that would expand Legionella testing.\n\"It's not just in the cooling towers. It can be throughout the building's potable water system,\" McIver said. \"It can also happen from showerhead and you breathe it in. That's also a possible source.\n\"There is a current city law that only applies to cooling towers. It does not apply to the rest of the building water management system. It does not apply to potable water at all,\" she added.\nSome New Yorkers say they are worried about potential spread of the disease.\n\"The superintendent in the building said he said he's gonna check the water every day and he's gonna make sure the air 'cause we got central air. He's gonna make sure that's clean and everything,\" one person said.\n\"What they should be doing is putting up flyers,\" another said.\nThe city says it has launched an awareness campaign, going door to door in Harlem distributing pamphlets and educating residents, especially those most at risk.\nWhat is Legionnaires' disease?\nLegionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia that can lead to cough, fever, chills and difficulty breathing.\nHealth officials say the disease can be treated with antibiotics. Again, it is not transmitted person to person, nor can you get it from drinking water. Instead, people get it by breathing in mist or vapor that contains the bacteria, which grows in warm, stagnant water. That mist can then be spread through HVAC systems like cooling towers, shower heads, hot tubs, or faulty plumbing.\nComplications are less likely the earlier treatment begins.\nThe best protection right now is awareness. Know the symptoms, and if you feel sick, get checked out early."
