      "summary": "GOBankingRates’ July 2025 study ranks Stockbridge, Georgia as the fastest‑growing suburb with home values under $500 k, followed by a cluster of Texas and Florida suburbs that have seen 10–25 % population growth between 2021 and 2023. The report highlights that the median home price in New York is approaching $600 k, prompting many residents to relocate to more affordable markets. In a separate analysis, the firm estimates that families in the country’s top school districts—such as Palo Alto, California and Old Westbury, New York—must earn over $500 k pre‑tax to comfortably cover housing, taxes and living expenses. Together, the pieces illustrate a widening affordability gap and a shift of middle‑class households toward lower‑priced suburban markets.",
