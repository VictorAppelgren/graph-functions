      "summary": "The Trump administration’s July 9 memo now requires parents of unaccompanied children to appear in person for ICE interviews, a move that has led to arrests of some parents while their children remain in U.S. custody. The directive, issued by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, aims to better vet sponsors but critics argue it adds unnecessary hurdles and may deter parents from reuniting with their children. ICE has also begun interviewing children in shelters, raising concerns about language barriers and trauma‑informed practices. The policy reflects a broader shift toward stricter enforcement of immigration and reunification procedures amid ongoing debates over child custody and federal‑state cooperation.",
