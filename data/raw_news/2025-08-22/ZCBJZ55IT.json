  "title": "Data shows China\u2019s economy lagged in July due to Trump\u2019s tariffs",
  "description": "Pressure from tariff uncertainty has caused China's manufacturers to slow down on investments, hiring, and production.",
  "content": "China\u2019s economy showed signs of slowing in July as factory output and retail sales slowed and housing prices dropped further, according to data released Friday.\n\n\n\nUncertainty over tariffs on exports to the United States is still looming over the world\u2019s second-largest economy after President Donald Trump extended a pause in sharp hikes in import duties for 90 days, beginning Monday, following a 90-day pause that began in May.\n\n\n\nAs officials worked toward a broader trade agreement, China reported earlier that its exports surged 7.2% in July year-on-year, while its imports grew at the fastest pace in a year, as businesses rushed to take advantage of the truce in Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing.\n\n\n\nBut that also reflected a lower base for comparison, and manufacturers have slowed investments, hiring and production as they watch to see what comes. Chinese manufacturers also have ramped up shipments to Southeast Asia, Africa and other regions to help offset lost business in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\u201cExports remained a bright spot although the boost from front-loading appears to be tapering off and has started to show up in weak industrial production, as we anticipated,\u201d Oxford Economics\u2019 Sheana Yue wrote in a report.\n\n\n\nChina also has been enduring flooding from torrential seasonal rains that have disrupted business activity in many parts of the country.\n\n\n\nThe statistics bureau\u2019s report said the economy had shown \u201cnotable resilience and vitality against the complex and volatile external environment and adverse impacts from extreme domestic weather.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnnual growth in industrial output slowed to 5.7% in July from 6.8% in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said. That was an 8-month low.\n\n\n\nInvestments in factory equipment and other fixed assets rose a meager 1.6% in January-July, compared with 2.8% growth in the first half of the year.\n\n\n\n\u201cChinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year,\u201d Lynne Song of ING Economics said in a report.\n\n\n\nProperty investments plunged 12% in the first seven months of the year, with residential housing investment dropping nearly 11%.\n\n\n\nPrices for newly built housing in major cities fell 1.1%, as a prolonged downturn in the property industry lingered.\n\n\n\nYue of Oxford Economics said prices could continue to fall before stabilizing in 2028.\n\n\n\nThe meltdown in the housing market hit just as the COVID -19 pandemic began, sapping one of the economy\u2019s main drivers of growth and causing dozens of developers to default on their debts.\n\n\n\nThe crisis rippled throughout the economy, destroying jobs for millions of people.\n\n\n\nThe government has sought to ensure that most housing that was paid for gets built, but sales remain weak despite a series of moves meant to entice families into back into the market.\n\n\n\nSince most Chinese families have their wealth tied up in property, the anemic housing market has been a major factor crimping consumer spending. In July, retail sales rose 3.7%, the slowest rate in seven months and down from a 4.8% increase in June.\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 5.2% from 5% as university graduates began looking for work.\n\n\n\nWhile consumer prices rose 0.4% in July from the month before, prices at the wholesale level slipped 3.6% from a year earlier in another indicator of relatively weak demand.",
