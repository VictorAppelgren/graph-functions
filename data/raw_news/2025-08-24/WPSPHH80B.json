  "description": "Parents shouldn't rush to 'get over' back-to-school sadness that can surface as children return to the classroom. Sadness is an innate biological response to loss.",
  "content": "Sadness is an emotion we often associate with breakups, job loss, or death. But it doesn\u2019t only appear when catastrophe strikes. As psychotherapists and parent educators, we know sadness is also a natural part of parenting\u2014especially during the back-to-school season.\n\nJust last week, a colleague shared a conversation they had with a friend. \"I cried when I took my kid back to college,\" the friend admitted. Our colleague replied, \"Come on! Isn\u2019t that a bit much? Get over it already!\"\n\nThis exchange shows how sadness is often misunderstood. Society tells us to \"push it aside\" or \"ignore it.\" Many of us grew up believing that sadness burdens others or signals depression. Men, in particular, are often taught that expressing sadness is a sign of weakness. In short, we\u2019re shamed for feeling sad.\n\nBut sadness isn\u2019t a flaw or a problem to be solved. It\u2019s a universal emotion and learning to work with it benefits both your physical and mental health. Research shows that processing sadness can protect your heart and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide we share with parents on how to recognize, validate, and make use of sadness.\n\nSadness is an innate biological response to loss\u2014which is why so many parents experience it. This emotion can arise during any transition: your child\u2019s first day of preschool, kindergarten, or high school; when a teenager retreats to their room instead of spending time with the family; or when an adult child leaves home for good.\n\nWhen sadness is criticized or discouraged in childhood, we learn to block it with anxiety, guilt, or shame\u2014\"inhibitory emotions\" that prevent us from even realizing we\u2019re sad. Cut off from this vital feeling, we often rely on \"protective defenses\" to avoid pain. These might look like snapping at our kids, drinking too much, isolating ourselves, or failing to set boundaries.\n\nA helpful tool for navigating sadness is the Change Triangle. Originally developed by David Malan for psychotherapists and later adapted for general use, it serves as an emotional compass.\n\nMY OLDEST IS GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE AND I\u2019M NOT READY\n\nWe all get disconnected from core emotions like sadness. When this happens, we often get stuck in defenses or inhibitory emotions such as guilt, shame, and anxiety. The Change Triangle helps guide us back to our core emotions so we can release their energy and return to a calmer state.\n\nStep 3: Practice four steps to validate and release sadness\n\nThink about something that stirs sadness\u2014maybe the end of summer, the loss of family time to teens\u2019 social lives, or the transition to an \"empty nest.\" Then, try these four steps:\n\n1. Befriend your sadness by naming it\n\nUnacknowledged emotions can trigger physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches, as well as emotional distress such as anxiety or anger. Simply naming the feeling\u2014\"I feel sad\"\u2014helps calm the brain. Research on \"affect labeling\" shows this practice soothes the limbic system, reducing emotional intensity.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\n2. Notice it in your body\n\nSadness often appears as heaviness, an aching heart, or sluggishness. Become an \"emotional astronomer\" and observe how it feels in your body. Deep belly breathing can help you ride the full wave of the emotion.\n\nSadness may bring an urge to cry, curl up, or seek comfort. Ask yourself: If my tears could speak, what would they say? Parents often answer with statements like, \"I miss unstructured time with my kids,\" or \"I\u2019m sad that my child doesn\u2019t need me as much anymore.\" These impulses are biological, not signs of weakness.\n\n4. Make good use of your sadness\n\nOnce you\u2019ve recognized the feeling, ask: Can I honor what sadness wants me to do?\n\nFor example, if you miss calls from your college-bound child, acknowledge the emotion and remind yourself it\u2019s temporary. If your school-age child no longer craves snuggles, lean on your partner or a friend for comfort. Doing so prevents you from unintentionally guilting your child with statements like, \"You don\u2019t want to spend time with me anymore\" or \"You\u2019re growing up too fast\u2014it makes me depressed.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen we name and honor sadness, we can \"feel and deal.\" This emotional awareness allows us to take adaptive actions that support both ourselves and our families.\n\nSadness is not something to escape. It\u2019s a signal, a teacher, and a tool for connection. By learning to work with it, we foster resilience, strengthen relationships, and model healthy emotional expression for our children.\n\nJuli Fraga, Psy.D., is a clinical psychologist, parenting educator, and co-author of \"Parents Have Feelings, Too.\"",

      "text": "So many experiences in life are things you can never prepare for adequately, no matter how many books you read or classes you attend or people you talk to. One of those experiences is watching your first child graduate high school, choose her college and eventually leave home.\nThis is what has caused me to pick up the pieces of my broken heart that is somehow so full of joy but also in shards at my feet because how do you possibly prepare for such a moment?\nWhen I had my first child, Grace, I caught my breath the first time I saw her. Like many moms, that first time I saw my baby was overwhelming and the love I felt became an all-consuming fire. How could she be so perfect and so tiny? My heart felt like it was literally outside of my body.\nAnd then I blinked.\nBUILDING YOUR ADVENTURE: CIA VETERAN SHARES AN INSPIRING STORY ABOUT COURAGE WITH GRADUATES\nWe visited a few colleges and universities over the past several months, and she eventually narrowed the options to two \u2013 both of which I loved, but one was clearly my favorite. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was hers.\nJust a few weeks ago, after we got back from my frontrunner university pick, I was driving by her school when I saw a bunch of kids outside with signs and graduation caps. Because curiosity usually wins over most temptations, I stopped to see what was going on.\nIt was a photo shoot and the photographer was telling the kids to hold a sign of the college they would be attending in the fall. I told my daughter that she had to hold two signs because she had not made her decision yet. She looked me in the eye and said, \"No, I\u2019ve made my decision,\" and held up the sign of the school that I was praying she would choose.\nWe started jumping up and down, and I was thrilled. It takes awhile for big decisions to set in sometimes.\nI\u2019M A MOM ON SCREEN AND OFF. BUILDING A FAMILY IS A JOURNEY OF LOVE AND COMMITMENT\nThis school is several states away from where we live. My daughter would be leaving home to go here. She would not be home for dinner every night. I wouldn\u2019t catch her eye as she played with her younger siblings and smile at her generosity and kindness. My baby would be leaving.\nI posted the good news to my Facebook page and that\u2019s when reality started to sink in. My husband came home to find me crying and in a forced snuggle with my oldest son.\nI\u2019ve always said Grace was our practice child. My husband and I knew nothing. We were so young. We were growing up as she was growing up and made so many mistakes. But her name holds true: Grace is what she always gives to others.\nCLASS DISMISSED: COLLEGES EXPECTED TO CLOSE AS ENROLLMENT NUMBERS TANK\nAnd thankfully, she gave it to my husband and I because we had no idea what we were doing. And just when we thought we had this parenting thing down after eight kids, a whole new world of unknowns opens up as our oldest heads off to college.\nIt\u2019s a weird place to be in as a mother. I\u2019m thrilled for her and incredibly proud of the young woman she has become. She is the complete opposite of the person I was at her age, which is an immense blessing.\nShe is everything I was not: she loves well, she is vulnerable, she forgives easily, she is virtuous, she takes chances on people, she has integrity. I did nothing to deserve her, yet God gave her to me. And now she is leaving.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nFor us parents who are navigating these waters for the first time, we have to allow ourselves to feel these feelings and emotions and not hide from them. They are all part of the human experience and it\u2019s good for our other children to see how much they mean to us.\nIn a world that sometimes exploits vulnerability, to show it can be empowering to others who may need to see that they aren\u2019t alone and that others feel the same way.\nTo parents whose children have not left home yet, don\u2019t waste a moment with them. My husband and I have always prioritized time with our kids, took vacations when we were able to with them, revised our schedules so one of us could always be with them, and made family time important.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nYou only get so many years with them before they fly off on their own. Don\u2019t waste that time.\nAnd when fall comes and I hug my oldest goodbye as she walks into this big, new chapter of her life, I\u2019ll probably be a mess. Many of us parents will be juggling both happy and sad feelings, but I hope all of us will be thanking God for our children and praying for them as they leap into the future."
