      "summary": "President Trump has deployed 800 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., citing a public safety emergency despite crime rates in the city declining. The troops are tasked with supporting law enforcement and guarding federal property, but many residents and local leaders question the necessity of this military presence, arguing that crime is at its lowest level in decades. Critics express concerns about the implications for civil liberties and the effectiveness of such measures, while some travelers at Union Station voiced both support and disapproval of the deployment.",
