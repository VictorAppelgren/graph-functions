  "content": "NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As millions of parents across the country prepare for the chaos of back-to-school season, one question continues to loom for many new mothers returning to work: Where will I pump?\n\nIn 2025, working moms are still navigating serious challenges, from limited paid leave to a lack of practical support like lactation spaces, mental health resources, and flexible scheduling. That's why Mediaplanet launched the Empowering Working Moms campaign \u2014 a national initiative featured in USA TODAY and online \u2014 to elevate the voices of mothers, employers, and advocates working to build more supportive and equitable workplaces.\n\nA key partner in that mission is Nessel, a women-led company designing workplace lactation solutions that make compliance effortless and culture change possible. Through products like ready-to-install lactation pods and lactation stations, Nessel helps employers turn legal requirements into real support by creating spaces that signal dignity, care, and flexibility.\n\nWhile the 2022 PUMP Act gives most employees the right to a private, non-bathroom space to express breastmilk, starting the conversation about pumping at work can still feel awkward or intimidating. Nessel believes it shouldn't be and that every parent deserves to feel seen, supported, and empowered.\n\nIf you're wondering how to talk to your employer about breastfeeding at work, here are a few ways to start the conversation:\n\u2022 Know your rights: Under the PUMP Act, employers with 50+ employees must provide a private lactation space and reasonable pumping breaks.\n\u2022 Be clear and confident: Share how often you need to pump, how long it will take, and what type of space or storage is required.\n\u2022 Reinforce your commitment: Make it known this isn't about stepping away from responsibilities \u2014 it's about integrating your needs into your workflow.\n\u2022 Offer solutions: If no lactation space exists, suggest proven options like Nessel's lactation pods and lactation stations.\n\u2022 Keep it ongoing: Your needs may change, and that's okay. Continue the conversation as needed.\n\nFrom built-in sinks and fridges to soundproofing and ergonomic seating, Nessel's thoughtful design ensures pumping parents can do so comfortably and without disruption while helping companies boost retention, reduce absenteeism, and foster a culture of care.\n\nTo learn more about workplace lactation solutions, visit www.nessel.com.\n\nTo explore the full Empowering Working Moms campaign \u2014 featuring stories, expert insights, and solutions from Allyson Felix, SHRM, U.S. Breastfeeding Committee and more \u2014 visit: futureofbusinessandtech.com/working-moms.",
