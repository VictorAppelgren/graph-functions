  "title": "An Intrinsic Calculation For Mercedes-Benz Group AG (ETR:MBG) Suggests It's 35% Undervalued",
  "description": "Key Insights Mercedes-Benz Group's estimated fair value is \u20ac81.84 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity...",
  "content": "\u2022 Mercedes-Benz Group's estimated fair value is \u20ac81.84 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 Mercedes-Benz Group is estimated to be 35% undervalued based on current share price of \u20ac53.35\n\u2022 The \u20ac60.08 analyst price target for MBG is 27% less than our estimate of fair value How far off is Mercedes-Benz Group AG (ETR:MBG) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early. We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = \u20ac40b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.8%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= \u20ac99b\u00f7 ( 1 + 9.8%)10= \u20ac39b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is \u20ac79b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of \u20ac53.4, the company appears quite good value at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mercedes-Benz Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Mercedes-Benz Group, there are three further aspects you should look at:\n\u2022 Risks: Take risks, for example - Mercedes-Benz Group has 3 warning signs (and 1 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does MBG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

  "summary": "Mercedes-Benz Group AG (ETR:MBG) is estimated to be 35% undervalued based on its fair value of \u20ac81.84 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity. This analysis uses the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to discount future cash flows back to their present value. The DCF model assumes that companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their growth rate, while companies with growing free flow will see their growth decrease. The Terminal Value accounts for all future cash flow after this ten-year period using a conservative growth rate. The Total Equity Value is \u20ac79b, which is based on the Total Equity Valuation of \u20ac53.35b. Despite these factors, the company appears to be a good value at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently.",

      "text": "Results\n28\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform healthcare by enhancing diagnostics, personalizing medicine, boosting operational efficiency, expanding remote care, and accelerating research. AI outperforms humans in detecting diseases like cancer from scans, tailors treatments using genetic and lifestyle data, and streamlines hospital workflows with tools like predictive analytics and automated transcription. It powers telemedicine, monitors chronic conditions in real-time, and speeds up drug discovery by analyzing vast datasets for insights into complex diseases. Despite challenges like data privacy, bias, and integration costs, AI\u2019s ability to improve accuracy, access, and affordability could save billions and extend lives, marking a seismic shift in

  "argos_summary": "Mercedes\u2011Benz Group AG is currently trading at \u20ac53.35, roughly 35% below its DCF\u2011derived fair value of \u20ac81.84, driven by a 9.8% cost of equity and a conservative 1.4% terminal growth rate. The company\u2019s free cash flow valuation yields a total equity value of \u20ac79\u202fbillion, with a present value of terminal value at \u20ac39\u202fbillion. Analysts maintain a 12\u2011month target of \u20ac60.08, 27% lower than the fair value, reflecting concerns over debt coverage, modest earnings growth (8.7% vs 16.5% German market) and a high debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratio of 115.6%. Dividend coverage remains strong, placing MBG in the top 25% of dividend payers, but the company\u2019s return on equity is projected to lag the broader market. Overall, MBG presents a compelling value play for investors seeking a discounted automotive exposure, though growth prospects are modest compared to peers.",
