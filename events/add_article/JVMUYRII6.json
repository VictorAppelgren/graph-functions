      "summary": "Yangaroo Inc. reported its second‑quarter 2025 results, showing a 15% revenue decline to $1.65 million largely due to a drop in advertising revenue amid geopolitical tensions and U.S. tariffs. The company posted an operating loss of $18.8 k but maintained a positive Normalized EBITDA of $220.9 k, marking its twelfth consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. Cost‑control measures, including headcount and marketing cuts, helped mitigate the impact of lower sales. The quarter also included settlements of $60 k and $150 k related to a 2021 acquisition lawsuit, and the company issued shares to CEO Grant Schuetrumpf under a related‑party shares‑for‑services arrangement.",
