  "title": "CDC shooter\u2019s motive revealed \u2014 documents show discontent with COVID-19 vaccines",
  "description": "Patrick Joseph Smith fired more than 180 shots into the CDC campus in Atlanta and broke 150 windows on Friday.",
  "content": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The man who fired more than 180 shots with a long gun at the headquarters of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention broke into a locked safe to get his father\u2019s weapons and wanted to send a message against COVID-19 vaccines, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nDocuments found in a search of the home where Patrick Joseph White lived with his parents \u201cexpressed the shooter\u2019s discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations,\u201d Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said.\n\nWhite, 30, had written about wanting to make \u201cthe public aware of his discontent with the vaccine,\u201d Hosey said.\n\nWhite also had recently verbalized thoughts of suicide, which led to law enforcement being contacted several weeks before the shooting, Hosey said. He died at the scene Friday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after killing a police officer.\n\nAsked about threats based on misinformation regarding the CDC and its vaccine work, FBI Special Agent Paul Brown said Tuesday: \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen an uptick, although any rhetoric that suggests or leads to violence is something we take very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough we are tracking it, we are sensitive to it, we have not seen that uptick,\u201d said Brown, who leads the FBI\u2019s Atlanta division.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s family was fully cooperating with the investigation, authorities said at the Tuesday news briefing. White had no known criminal history, Hosey said.\n\nExecuting a search warrant at the family\u2019s home in the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw, authorities recovered written documents that are being analyzed, and seized electronic devices that are undergoing a forensic examination, the agency said.\n\nInvestigators also recovered a total of five firearms, including a gun that belonged to his father that he used in the attack, Hosey said.\n\nHosey said the suspect did not have a key to the gun safe: \u201cHe broke into it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite had been stopped by CDC security guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street, where he opened fire from a sidewalk, authorities said. The bullets pierced \u201cblast-resistant\u201d windows across the campus, pinning employees down during the barrage. More than 500 shell casings have been recovered from the crime scene, the GBI said.\n\nIn the aftermath, officials at the CDC are assessing the security of the campus and making sure they notify officials of any new threats.\n\nU.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. toured the CDC campus on Monday, accompanied by Deputy Secretary Jim O\u2019Neill and CDC Director Susan Monarez, according to a health agency statement.\n\n\u201cNo one should face violence while working to protect the health of others,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Saturday. It said top federal health officials are \u201cactively supporting CDC staff.\u201d\n\nKennedy also visited the DeKalb County Police Department, and later met privately with the slain officer\u2019s wife.\n\nA photo of the suspect will be released later Tuesday, Hosey said, but he encouraged the public to remember the face of the officer instead.\n\nKennedy was a leader in a national anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump selected him to oversee federal health agencies, and has made false and misleading statements about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 shots and other vaccines.\n\nSome unionized CDC employees called for more protections. Some employees who recently left the agency as the Trump administration pursues widespread layoffs, meanwhile, squarely blamed Kennedy.\n\nYears of false rhetoric about vaccines and public health was bound to \u201ctake a toll on people\u2019s mental health,\u201d and \u201cleads to violence,\u201d said Tim Young, a CDC employee who retired in April.",

      "text": "CDC nominee Susan Monarez sidesteps questions about disagreements with RFK in Senate hearing\nCDC nominee Susan Monarez sidesteps questions about disagreements with RFK in Senate hearing\nSusan Monarez, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators Wednesday that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence, but largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency, elimination of programs and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.\n\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.\nMonarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.\nMonarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency\u2019s core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.\nHer answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.\nIn the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy\u2019s recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.\nSen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.\n\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who\u2019s reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.\nMonarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\u201d\n\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d\nShe vowed to prioritize innovation, \u201cevidence-based rapid decision-making\u201d and clear communication at the $9.2 billion agency tasked with evaluating vaccines, monitoring diseases and watching for threats to Americans\u2019 health.\nMonarez declined to say whether she had disagreed with any of Kennedy\u2019s decisions regarding the agency to date, saying he has \u201claid out a very clear vision.\u201d\n\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\u201d she added.\nIf Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director\u2019s role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.\nMonarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.\nAt CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.\nThe CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The father said his son had been upset over the death of the son\u2019s dog, and he had also become fixated on the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the official. The family lives in Kennesaw, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of CDC headquarters.\nA voicemail left at a phone number listed publicly for White\u2019s family wasn\u2019t returned Saturday.\nEmployees at the CDC are shaken\nThe shooting left gaping bullet holes in windows across the CDC campus, where thousands work on critical disease research. Employees huddled under lockdown for hours while investigators gathered evidence. Staff was encouraged to work from home Monday or take leave.\nAt least four CDC buildings were hit, Director Susan Monarez said on X.\nSam Atkins, who lives in Stone Mountain, said outside the CVS pharmacy on Saturday that gun violence feels like \u201ca fact of life\u201d now. \u201cThis is an everyday thing that happens here in Georgia.\u201d\nKennedy reaches out to staff\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC\u2019s Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,\u201d Kennedy said Saturday. \u201cWe know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.\u201d\nSome rejected the expressions of solidarity Kennedy made in a \u201cDear colleagues\u201d email, and called for his resignation.\n\u201cKennedy is directly responsible for the villainization of CDC\u2019s workforce through his continuous lies about science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and mistrust,\u201d said Fired But Fighting, a group of laid-off employees opposing changes to the CDC by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\nUnder Kennedy, CDC has laid off nearly 2,000 employees. Trump proposes cutting the agency\u2019s budget in half next year, moving some CDC functions into a new Administration for a Healthy America. Kennedy has a history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, but he reached new prominence by spreading distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. For example, he called it \u201ccriminal medical malpractice\u201d to give COVID-19 vaccines to children.\nKennedy parlayed that attention into a presidential bid and endorsement of Trump, leading to Trump naming him secretary. Kennedy continues to undercut the scientific consensus for vaccines, ordering $500 million cut from vaccine development funding on Tuesday.\nOpponents say officials\u2019 rhetoric contributed\nFired But Fighting also called for the resignation of Russell Vought, noting a video recorded before Trump appointed him Office of Management and Budget director with orders to dismantle much of the federal government.\n\u201cWe want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\u201d Vought said in the video, obtained by ProPublica and the research group Documented. \u201cWhen they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.\u201d\nA request for comment from Vought\u2019s agency wasn\u2019t returned.\nThis shooting was the \u201cphysical embodiment of the narrative that has taken over, attacking science, and attacking our federal workers,\u201d said Sarah Boim, a former CDC communications staffer who was fired this year during a wave of terminations.\nA distrust of COVID-19 vaccines\nA neighbor of White told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White spoke with her multiple times about his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines.\nNancy Hoalst, who lives on the same street as White\u2019s family, said he seemed like a \u201cgood guy\u201d while doing yard work and walking dogs for neighbors, but he would bring up vaccines even in unrelated conversations.\n\u201cHe was very unsettled, and he very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people.\u201d Hoalst told the Atlanta newspaper. \u201cHe emphatically believed that.\u201d\nBut Hoalst said she never believed White would be violent: \u201cI had no idea he thought he would take it out on the CDC.\u201d\nSlain officer leaves wife and 3 kids\nRose, 33, was a former Marine who served in Afghanistan, graduated from the police academy in March and \u201cquickly earned the respect of his colleagues for his dedication, courage and professionalism,\u201d DeKalb County said.\n\u201cThis evening, there is a wife without a husband. There are three children, one unborn, without a father,\u201d DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson said.\nGrowing security concerns\nSenior CDC leadership told some staff Saturday that they would do a full security assessment following the shooting, according to a conference call recording obtained by the AP.\nOne staffer said people felt like \u201csitting ducks\u201d Friday. Another asked whether administrators had spoken with Kennedy and if they could speak to \u201cthe misinformation, the disinformation\u201d that \u201ccaused this issue.\u201d\nIt is clear CDC leaders fear employees could continue to be targeted. In a Saturday email obtained by the AP, CDC\u2019s security office asked employees to scrape old CDC parking decals off their vehicles. The office said decals haven\u2019t been required for some time.\n___\nRicher reported from Washington, D.C. Associated Press writer Anthony Izaguirre contributed from Albany, New York."
