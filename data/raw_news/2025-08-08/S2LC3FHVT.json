A new accessory seeks to replicate the look from Johannes Vermeer\u2019s classic painting using your AirPods Max. Yes, really.\n\nAirPods Max cover is inspired by \u2019Girl with a Pearl Earring\u2019\n\nThe Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, Netherlands has partnered with CASETiFY on a new collection of accessories for Apple devices that are all inspired by one famous work: Girl with a Pearl Earring.\n\nWhile most of the accessories simply use an image of the classic painting, for AirPods Max the team clearly got more creative.\n\nThe \u2018Girl with a Pearl Earring Collectible Headphone Cover\u2019 is currently sold out, despite its steep $184 price tag.\n\nBut as you can see in the image above, it offers a way to transform your AirPods Max and make them look like they\u2019re straight out of the painting.\n\nI want to applaud the creativity and curiosity of whoever had this idea in the first place. It\u2019s a wild one, but it certainly makes for a unique fashion piece.\n\nOr again, the perfect complement to a killer Halloween getup.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most bizarre AirPods Max accessory you\u2019ve seen to date?
