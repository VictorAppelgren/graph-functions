      "feedback": "The analysis draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the macroeconomic landscape but requires enhancements in clarity, specificity, and actionable insights. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, ensure a coherent causal chain by explicitly linking inflation impacts to specific sectors and corporate behaviors, avoiding generalizations. The section on technology should succinctly connect the Google Password Manager's launch to broader market implications, while the financial sector's scrutiny needs clearer examples of potential volatility triggers. Adhere strictly to the SECTION FOCUS format by outputting the required four lines of Up/Down scenarios and a concise trade/outlook plan, ensuring each line includes precise time windows, drivers, and probabilities based on the evidence provided. Quantify potential impacts more rigorously, such as specifying the expected range for corporate margin contractions. Lastly, increase citation density by integrating in-text citations more effectively throughout the analysis to support claims and reconcile any conflicting information.",
