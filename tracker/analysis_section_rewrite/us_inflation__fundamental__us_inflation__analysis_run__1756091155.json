      "feedback": "The draft has a plausible multi‑year regime logic but it underdelivers on war‑game rigor and first‑principles anchors. Strengthen by (1) building a formal, invariant regime map anchored to first‑principles: state explicit real‑rate differentials, a monetary‑policy reaction function around a 2% inflation target with a flexible average framework, and transition rules that move from tight to easy as data permit; spell out regimes (tight, transition, easy) and the conditions that switch between them. (2) Translate the causal chain into a crisp, testable transmission: policy easing or stable real rates lowers discount rates for crypto‑cash flows, lifts ETF/treasury demand, and broad risk‑on liquidity; tie to concrete channels (ETH ETFs inflows, corporate ether treasuries, staking yields, stablecoins) and quantify their contribution where possible. (3) Add a true scenario structure: base case, upside, downside, with explicit catalysts and invalidation points (e.g., Powell rate‑path surprises, ETF/Project Crypto approvals, GENIUS Act impact, tariff shocks, or a macro shock that reverses risk appetite). (4) Quantify with the numbers already in sources: ETH near all‑time highs (~$4,955) and BTC around ~$110k–$124k, Bitmine’s $45m purchase, July ETH ETF inflows >$5b and total ETH inflows ≈$9.6b, staking ~one‑third of supply, and the GENIUS/Project Crypto tailwinds; use these as anchors in a sensitivity table rather than vague assertions. (5) Tighten the wording to be source‑driven and avoid mixing in unrelated assets (Ford, etc. from 22PL3Q360) unless you’re purposefully contrasting macro cycles with crypto cycles, and then keep the contrast strictly topical. (6) Improve reconciliation of conflicts across sources: bet on OGK8WLL69 for policy/regulatory catalysts and ETF flows, use NL5YYTLF2 to frame the long‑run risk from UBI debates as a separate, downside risk channel, and cross‑check any claims against 2QRLB974F’s framing of value drivers; explicitly note any tensions and how you adjudicate them. (7) Clarify the base‑case confidence and lay out the “watch list” signals (ETF inflows, corporate treasury activity, staking uptake, Powell guidance) with concrete thresholds. (8) Ensure formatting discipline: after each causal assertion, append the supporting source ID(s) in parentheses and place a short, explicit takeaway sentence at the end of each regime or catalyst block.",
