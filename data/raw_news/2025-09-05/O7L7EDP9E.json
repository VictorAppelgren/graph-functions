  "description": "As the Warrens take on their final case in The Conjuring: Last Rites, we explain whether this is the end of the road for the Conjuring franchise",
  "content": "The Conjuring: Last Rites has just hit screens, with the jumpscare-filled film set to mark Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's final outing as Ed and Lorraine Warren. But with the Warrens shelving their Bibles and hanging up their rosary beads, you may be wondering \"is The Conjuring: The Last Rites the last Conjuring movie?\"\n\nWelcoming back our favorite ghost-hunting duo, Last Rites sees the Warrens take on their final case in 1986. The case in question is the Smurl haunting, based on real events where a working-class family reported that a demonic presence was taking over their home and assaulting them between the years 1974 and 1979. As well as Wilson and Farmiga, the movie also stars Mia Tomlinson as Ed and Lorraine's daughter Judy, and Ben Hardy as Judy's boyfriend Tony Spera.\n\nHowever, with The Conjuring 4 being last movie in the Conjuring franchise to feature the Warrens, what is going to happen to the Conjuring universe? Will we get any more Nun or Annabelle movies, or is this simply the end of the road for the horror saga? We tackle all of that and more below. But first, make sure to read our The Conjuring: Last Rites review.\n\nWill there be more Conjuring movies?\n\nYes, it's likely there will be more Conjuring movies, but they might look a little different going forward.\n\nThroughout filming, franchise creator James Wan referred to The Conjuring: Last Rites as the 'final' Conjuring movie many times. In July 2024, Wan called The Conjuring 4 the \"finale\" on social media, adding, \"end of an era,\" with a sad face emoji. Then later, in October 2024, the filmmaker took to Instagram once more and posted a picture of the Warren's director's chairs captioned, \"Always good to see and hang out with old friends. Gonna miss everyone. End of an era.\"\n\nWith that, anyone would think that The Conjuring: Last Rites is the final Conjuring movie. However, it seems as though it is just the final movie featuring Ed and Lorraine Warren. Wilson and Farmiga have made it known for quite some time that their journey as the Warrens would come to a close with Last Rites. As filming wrapped, Farmiga shared a touching post on Instagram dedicated to Wilson, reflecting on the past 12 years playing the demon-catching couple, calling it \"a match made in heaven.\"\n\nIn an interview with GamesRadar+, Last Rites director Michael Chaves said that now is the right time to conclude the Warrens' story as \"we don't want this to be a series that just kind of gets [run] into the ground. We wanted to end with confidence and on our own terms.\"\n\nThat said, just because the Warrens' time in the Conjuring universe is over, doesn't mean the franchise is. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, New Line Cinema president Richard Brener said that The Conjuring: Last Rites is just the end of The Conjuring Phase One. \"While this is the last of what we call phase one, we are hopeful that we can make more,\" said Brener, adding, \"Phase Two is TBD.\"\n\nClearly, we don't know what Phase Two will look like, and it is not certain whether original creator Wan will return to head it. But by the way Last Rites ended, we think there's another ghostly gifted couple ready to take on the Warren's bidding. We're looking at you, Judy and Tony!\n\nWithout spoiling too much, throughout the movie, we see Judy Warren experience terrifying visions, seeing demonic presences and ghosts just like her mother. Lorraine tries to keep Judy's visions at bay, telling her to close her eyes and sing until the spirits go away. However, Judy wants to help the Smurl family and even puts herself in danger in doing so. But by the end of Last Rites, Lorraine encourages Judy to embrace the spirit realm in order to control what she sees and try to combat it.\n\nAs for Tony, we see Judy's young boyfriend desperate for her father Ed's approval, so much so, he takes a keen interest in Ed's part in the Warrens' paranormal investigations. When Ed and Lorraine decide to leave their ghost-hunting days behind, Ed gives Tony the keys to the artifact room, as a passing of the baton of sorts. By the end of the film, Tony and he can be seen operating the projector at some of Ed's lectures and taking notes.\n\nWith a supportive man by her side, could Judy Warren, now Judy Spera, take on her mother's role and become the new paranormal investigative duo alongside her husband, Tony? That sure is a possibility.\n\nThe Conjuring: Last Rites is out in cinemas now.

      "text": "The best Conjuring Universe movies, ranked\nBefore Last Rites hits the big screen, catch up with The Conjuring franchise as we pick out the best and the worst of the series\nThere's never been a better time to catch up with The Conjuring Universe than right before Ed and Lorraine Warren take on their final case in the upcoming movie The Conjuring: Last Rites. That's right, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson will soon make their final outing as the ghost-hunting duo, and we're so sad about it. However, with just weeks left to binge the already released movies before Last Rites hits the big screen, you may be wondering, which films are worth watching, and which are more skippable than spooky.\nThe original movie, directed by Saw's James Wan, hit the big screen in 2013 and scared audiences silly with a story based on real-life events, following real-life demonologists, the Warrens, investigating the famous Amityville haunting in 1971. Over 10 years later, the franchise has spanned 9 movies, with one more on the way. As well as the three and counting Conjuring movies, there are multiple The Nun and Annabelle spin-offs, and a movie based on Latin American folklore. However, as with many horror franchises, some entries are better than others.\nSo, while we wait for Last Rites to start haunting theatres, let us take you through the most demonic horror saga as we rank The Conjuring movies from worst to best. Put down your rosary beads and prayer book, and get scrolling...\n9. The Curse of La Llorona\nLet us begin by stating that Linda Cardellini can do wrong, whether she's playing an ill-fated otter, a Great Dane's mystery solving pal, or a murderer with a perfect perm. That said, The Curse of La Llorona is not very good \u2013 and undoubtedly the weakest entry in The Conjuring Universe.\nFor starters, its connection to the larger franchise is tenuous, which might explain why director Michael Chaves recently argued that it's not connected. Like The Conjuring, it's set in the early 1970s, and follows single mother and social worker Anna who, you've guessed it, is being targeted by a malevolent spirit. Desperate, Anna seeks out the help of Father Perez (Tony Amendola), a character also featured in 2014's Annabelle. Thanks to his own horrific experiences, the priest points her in the direction of another, and thus concludes his involvement \u2013 and the film's link to the others in the series.\nThere's interesting stuff at play here. Taking inspiration from Mexican folklore, it makes early comments about how some people ignore or, worse, dismiss other cultures, as well as the social care system. But all of that quickly gets side-stepped in favor of something much more generic and way too jumpscare-heavy. Shame.\n8. Annabelle\nAnnabelle's prologue is killer; a surprisingly nasty, 1960s-set sequence that sees a young doctor and his expectant wife attacked by the murderers of their next-door neighbors in the middle of the night. During the blood-soaked assault, one of the killers takes her own life while holding a vintage porcelain doll the soon-to-be parents received recently as a gift for their baby. You can see where this is going, right? Later, the deceased woman is identified as their neighbors' estranged daughter, Annabelle, who had not long joined a devil-worshipping cult with her good-for-nothing boyfriend. Never a good sign!\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nThe rest, though, is kind of boring? As it was the first spin-off in the series, it was hard to vibe with the sudden lack of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson's Warrens, and writer Gary Dauberman and director John R. Leonetti never seemed to capture the atmospheric flair present in Leigh Whannell and James Wan's The Conjuring.\nAt the time of its release, critics claimed the movie to be \"a cliched mess, lacking humor and surprises\" and a \"routine run-of-the-mill horror flick.\" Ah well, at least the doll is creepy AF, eh?\n7. The Nun\nAfter the character proved popular in The Conjuring 2, Bonnie Aarons' demonic Valak got her own origin story in The Nun \u2013 and the finished product is a mixed bag. Any genre fan worth their salt knows that religious horror is the best kind of horror \u2013 the iconography! the camp! the ultimate embodiment of good VS evil! \u2013 and The Nun certainly delivers on the visual front.\nThe production design is gorgeous, as it follows Taissa Farmiga's novitiate Sister Irene, who gets sent to a remote Romanian monastery to investigate one mysterious death and a suicide on the holy ground. Casting Vera Farmiga's real-life sister proved a genius way of further connecting it to the wider franchise, like an in-joke for fans, and she's endlessly likeable as the forward-thinking heroine. The movie itself, though, fails to offer up any truly memorable scares.\n6. The Nun 2\nWell, it's better than the first Nun movie, we'll give it that. Set a few years after its predecessor, The Nun 2 sees Sister Irene forced to face Valak once again, when she learns the demon is murdering its way across Europe with the help of her old pal Maurice (Jonas Bloquet).\nThe set pieces are more adventurous and exciting here, while the nastiness director Michael Chaves, who takes over from Corin Hardy, injects into some of the more violent scenes makes it stand out from The Conjuring series' meeker movies. Farmiga is predictably good as Irene while The Last of Us star Storm Reid offers up some comic relief as reluctant novice Sister Debra.\nThat said, we're not entirely sold on Irene's interesting backstory, which connects her to The Conjuring's Lorraine Warren \u2013 and a saint, too. Aside from those very specific reveals, we've seen genre films of this ilk a million times over.\n5. The Conjuring 3\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is arguably the darkest of the trio, given that it revolves around a real-life murder trial. It also happens to be our least favorite.\nSet in the early 1980s, it sees Ed and Lorraine face horrors in their homestate of Connecticut, after an exorcism on a young possessed boy goes sideways. Instead of sending the demon back to Hell, the Warrens inadvertently transport it into the boy's sister's boyfriend Arne. Despite the 20-something's resistance to its evil, it forces him to violently kill his landlord, which prompts the Warrens to try and prove Arne wasn't in control of his own body in a court of law.\nFor the first time in the series, the movie boldly touches on the public's thoughts about the Warrens' work and how, like in real-life, they were often accused of exploiting vulnerable people to make money or further their celebrity profiles. It also sidesteps ghostly villains for more realistic witchy ones, which makes for a welcome switch-up.\nUnfortunately, it favors louder, cheaper frights than the Conjuring movies that came before it, which lets it down a bit, and the Warrens actually aren't in it all that much. But Ruairi O'Connor is truly wonderful as tortured Arne.\n4. Annabelle: Creation\nGiven Annabelle's reception, expectations for its follow-up Annabelle: Creation were low, which undoubtedly helped the prequel out in terms of impressing audiences. On the surface, it's pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, but it does feature Miranda Otto, a darkly decent origin story at its core, and a bunch of great scares.\nOne knee-knocking highlight sees main character Janice stumble on the eponymous doll for the first time. Spooked, she covers the toy with a bedsheet but as the scene continues, the doll \u2013 still underneath the sheet \u2013 stands up in the background of the shot and eerily glides closer to Janice. The youngster turns around and freezes with fright, as Annabelle steps towards her, knees bending and all. Just as Janice is about to scream, though, the sheet drops to the floor, revealing nothing underneath.\nUp until that point, it's been spelled out repeatedly that Annabelle is a vessel for evil spirits so we've never actually seen her in action. While she's obscured in that scene, it still lets us revel in what it would be like if she went full Chucky and started moving about.\nAnnabelle: Creation also features a cameo from Bonnie Aarons' The Nun, reinforcing how interconnected these movies are. Fun!\n3. Annabelle Comes Home\nAnnabelle Comes Home may not be the best of The Conjuring Universe movies, but we'd happily make a case for it being the most enjoyable. It's essentially the franchise's answer to the Avengers if, you know, the Avengers were supernatural bad guys who wanted to kill everyone.\nWritten by Wan and Dauberman, and directed by the latter, it follows Ed and Lorraine's daughter Judy (an always great Mckenna Grace), who gets herself into a world of trouble when she and her babysitters accidentally unleash the titular doll's spirit \u2013 and she, in turn, frees several other ghoulies previously trapped inside the Warrens' artifact room.\nBy refusing to center one baddie, the film offers up something for everyone, from skeletal ghost The Ferryman and a haunted board game to a freaking werewolf, and is able to seriously diversify its scares, too. (It's giving Goosebumps, and we mean that as a compliment). The variety gives the movie an energy that many of the previous instalments were missing and teen protagonists make for a refreshing change. Farmiga and Wilson also have decent-sized cameos. What more could you want?\n2. The Conjuring 2\nThe Conjuring 2 features a scene in which Patrick Wilson serenades his onscreen wife and a bunch of scared children, and for that reason alone it could've justifiably nabbed the top spot on this list. Alas, though, we've declared it runner-up instead.\nSet six years after the events of the first film, it sees the Warrens travel to Enfield, England to help single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) and her four kids, who have become the target of a particularly malevolent, supernatural entity. You know... the usual. But James Wan breathes life into a familiar story with creepy set-pieces, heart-wrenching character drama, and an instantly iconic villain (The Nun, of course). The scene in which the ghostly Bill Wilkins \"talks\" to Ed through Janet, who's holding water in her mouth, and another where Lorraine gets spooked by a Valak painting, are masterclasses in building dread and utilizing artistic cinematography.\nIts cold open is brilliant, too. At end of The Conjuring, it's teased that the Warrens' next case would be in Long Island, which led true crime aficionados to assume the second film would center on the Amityville murders. It didn't obviously, but Wan still gives us a taste of the infamous case here, as Lorraine channels Ronald DeFeo Jr in a vision, and acts out killing his whole family. Chilling stuff.\n1. The Conjuring\nIt had to be, didn't it? It may sound a bit twee to say but without The Conjuring, there would be no Conjuring Universe and with the films at the top of this list all being so good, it only seems fair to put the original at #1.\nIt's practically perfect, as it introduces us to the insanely likeable lovebirds Ed and Lorraine. It's become obvious as the years have gone on, and the more movies have been released, that the duo's romance is the franchise's secret weapon and they're never more charming than they are here. So often in horror, spouses are driven apart by supernatural goings on, as husbands doubt their hysterical wives and what not. Here, the Warrens are united, as dedicated to one another as they are helping those being terrorized by otherworldly threats.\nThat's not to say that it skimps on frights, however. The Conjuring boasts several unforgettable scares, from that hide and clap moment and the dangling dead feet to Bathesba's reveal towards the end of the movie. It didn't need blood and gore to get its across, it did so with great writing, style \u2013 those costumes! \u2013 and fantastic performances. There's no denying The Conjuring's instant classic status.\nFor more, check out our list of all the upcoming horror movies heading our way in 2023 and beyond.\nI am an Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, covering all things TV and film across our Total Film and SFX sections.

      "text": "Consisting of 10 movies (yes, we count The Curse of La Llorona around these parts), The Conjuring franchise is one of the most successful horror franchises in the history of cinema \u2013 and has given us some of the best horror movies of all time. Over the last 12 years, the series has, well, conjured up a staggering $2.2 billion... and will be adding to the (likely haunted) pot o' gold substantially with The Conjuring: Last Rites.\nStarring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, the upcoming follow-up is set to mark the final big screen appearance for their characters, paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. With that, we've been looking back on the film that started it all in 2013, as well as the sequels and spin-offs it paved the spooky way for.\nIf you're feeling nostalgic, too, and have been thinking about revisiting the sinister cinematic universe, you've come to the right place. On the flip side, if you're looking to watch the series for the very first time, you've also come to the right place. Below, we've outlined the best ways to watch all of The Conjuring movies (through your fingers, or not), from order of release to chronological. So grab your rosaries and crucifixes and let's get cracking...\nHow to watch The Conjuring movies in release order\nRecommended for: newcomers to The Conjuring Universe.\nIf you're just starting out your Conjuring journey, we'd suggest watching the horror series in release order, given the interesting way it introduces certain characters and lore. You'll meet the mysterious demon nun Valak in The Conjuring 2, for example, before unravelling her origins in The Nun. Same goes for the Annabelle spin-offs, which came out after the doll scared us silly in the very first movie.\n- The Conjuring (2013)\n- Annabelle (2014)\n- The Conjuring 2 (2016)\n- Annabelle: Creation (2017)\n- The Nun (2018)\n- The Curse of La Llorona (2019)\n- Annabelle Comes Home (2019)\n- The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021)\n- The Nun 2 (2023)\n- The Conjuring: Last Rites (2025)\nWe've chosen to include The Curse of La Llorona, which was critically maligned when it was released, since it shares some major connectivity \u2013 even if director Michael Chaves and producer Peter Safran claim it's not an official entry.\n\"Peter gave his permission to let [Annabelle] be in there,\" Chaves told Entertainment Weekly back in 2023. \"The funny thing is that it was supposed to be a secret, it was supposed to be this Easter Egg, and [when the film premiered at] SXSW, there was a slip-up. The presenter introduced the movie as the next entry in the Conjuring Universe. So that was a big kind of faux pas. It was a big mess-up, and that's the truth of how that all came together.\"\n\"You can't count it!\" Safran chimed in. \"It periodically gets lumped in because of Chaves and because of [James Wan's production company] Atomic Monster, but it is not officially part of the universe. By the way, I think Chaves did a great job on the movie, which is why we stole him for the Conjuring universe.\"\nIn the flick, Linda Cardellini's Anna gets so spooked by the entity that's stalking her that she seeks the help of Father Perez (Tony Amendola), a character first seen in 2014's Annabelle. During his only scene, he refers to \"an incident with a doll\", before a flashback shows him carrying Annabelle, as his reason for not wanting to assist and palming her off to Raymond Cruz's priest Rafael Olvera. Sorry, guys, we're calling canon on that one.\nHow to watch The Conjuring movies in chronological order\nRecommended for: returning Conjuring Universe viewers.\nSo, you're aware of The Conjuring Universe... You've witnessed the Warrens face off against all kinds of sinister forces a bunch of times, and fancy looking at all from a different angle? We're here to help. Below, we have a list of the chronological order of The Conjuring movies, followed by a deeper dive into why everything sits where it sits. Prepare yourselves \u2013 it gets a little complicated.\n- The Nun\n- Annabelle: Creation\n- The Nun 2\n- Annabelle\n- The Conjuring\n- Annabelle Comes Home\n- The Curse of La Llorona\n- The Conjuring 2\n- The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It\n- The Conjuring: Last Rites\nThe Nun spin-offs\nSet in 1952, The Nun is first up in our chronological list, though it's worth noting that Annabelle: Creation opens with a flashback scene set in 1944. So if you wanting to do things the real genre nerd way, watch the latter's prologue before tuning in to the entirety of The Nun. (We're electing to ignore that The Nun features a brief flashback to the Dark Ages, because the purpose of this guide is to make things simpler).\nDirected by Corin Hardy, it follows novitiate Irene (Taissa Farmiga, Vera's real-life sister, which comes more into play later on) as she teams up with a priest to investigate the death of a young nun. Did the sister end her own life, as it seems, or are their supernatural forces wreaking murderous havoc in the abbey? I'm sure you'll guess the answer to that.\nThe Nun 2 picks up with Irene four years later, which means it slots in at #3. There are moments in the sequel that get a little timey-wimey, like when Irene has visions of her ancestors that reveal she actually shares a bloodline with The Conjuring's Lorraine, but nothing that we feel warrants it being placed elsewhere.\nAnnabelle, oh Annabelle\nBefore that, prequel-to-a-prequel Annabelle: Creation is at #2, with the main part of the story taking place in 1955. Directed by Until Dawn's David F. Sandberg, it centers on the dollmaker who crafted the titular toy, in an attempt to embed it with their late daughter's spirit.\n12 years later, the dollmaker (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife (Miranda Otto) invite a young nun and several girls, who've found themselves without a place to stay following the closure of their orphanage, into their home. But it turns out, the evil entity inside Annabelle isn't too happy about their new godly guests...\nAnnabelle, the first prequel that details the pig-tailed puppet's bloody beginnings, is set in 1967, which means it's next on the list. Directed by John R. Leonetti, it sees expectant couple John (Ward Horton) and Mia (Annabelle Wallis) get more than they bargained for, when the former buys his wife a vintage doll and they suffer an unfortunate run-in with a Satanic Cult.\nThe events of Annabelle Comes Home play out shortly after The Conjuring, so you'll have to check out the Warrens' infamous case in Rhode Island before you hit play on that first. After that? You're good to watch The Curse of La Llorona.\nWhat's up, Warrens?\nFrom then on, things are pretty simple, as we've got The Conjuring 2, which takes place in 1976; The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, in 1981, and the upcoming installment The Conjuring: Last Rites, which is set in 1986. Kind of fitting really, given that it's been 12 years since we met Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and their first and last films have 15 fictional years between them. Close enough!\nDirected by Michael Chaves, who also helmed The Curse of La Llorona, The Devil Made Me Do It, and The Nun 2, Last Rites takes inspiration from the real-life Smurl haunting in Pennsylvania.\n\"We've known about this one for a long time,\" Wilson previously told Entertainment Weekly. \"Then writers are playing around with how it affects the family and what's going on in the family's life. That's where we can really theatricalize it. We're not making a documentary.\"\nWhere to stream The Conjuring movies?\nIf you're based in the US, the above question has a very simple answer, since every installment is available to stream with a subscription to HBO Max. If you're in the UK, it's a lot trickier...\nThe Nun, Annabelle, and Annabelle: Creation can be viewed via Sky or NOW, The Curse of La Llorona is free on Prime Video, and The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are on Netflix. Meanwhile, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, Annabelle Comes Home, and The Nun 2 are only available to rent or buy digitally.\nFor more, check out our guide to some of the most exciting upcoming horror movies heading our way.\nI am an Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, covering all things TV and film across our Total Film and SFX sections.

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nNot disastrous but disappointing all the same, The Conjuring: Last Rites commits the ultimate sin of not quite being bold or memorable enough for a final chapter. It's a much bloodier, louder, in-your-face affair than any of the previous flicks, which more closely evokes the likes of Insidious and even Evil Dead; an energetic, fast-paced romp (its lengthy 135-minute runtime whizzes by), robbed of the universe's signature, stylish chill.\nPros\n- +\nVera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson continue to be endlessly watchable\n- +\nIts focus on the Warrens will please those who didn't vibe with The Devil Made Me Do It\n- +\nYou don't feel that 135-minute runtime\nCons\n- -\nFeels like a movie we've seen countless times before\n- -\nLacks visual flair\n- -\nBoasts an odd, often deliberately funny tone that undercuts the scares and emotion\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\n\"After all these years, it wasn't done with us,\" Vera Farmiga's clairvoyant Lorraine Warren ominously says of the evil entity in new horror movie The Conjuring: Last Rites. It scared her and doting demonologist husband Ed (Patrick Wilson) off decades ago \u2013 seen in a 60s-set prologue; a neat, albeit random and slightly lazy, way to set up the Big Bad and establish our heroes' connection to 'em \u2013 and now it's back to finish them off via a haunted mirror and a God-fearing family in Pennsylvania. In short, they've seen all this before, and despite the signs telling them it's an ill-judged idea, they've come back for more. 10 movies in and, sadly, similar can be said for us longtime fans of the franchise.\nAfter The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It shook things up by centering on a murder trial case and forcing the Warrens to team up with the police to try to prove possession rather than expunge it, the surprisingly safe final film in the Warren-led main series takes things back to basics.\nIn 1986, said mirror is picked up secondhand by the Smurls and given to Heather, one of their grandchildren, as a gift to commemorate her confirmation. But almost as soon as she unwraps it, creepy things start happening in their home. The spooky goings-on escalate quickly, from levitating dolls to vivid visions of an axe murderer stomping the halls and Heather's sister vomiting shards of glass, prompting the family to beg the church for help. When it doesn't heed their call, the Warrens are encouraged by their psychic daughter Judy (Mia Tomlinson) to step in. Ed's fragile heart, be damned.\nFrantic frights\nDirector Michael Chaves, having earned his jumpscare chops helming The Nun 2 and The Curse of La Llorona, deploys some genuinely effective frights here. It's a Rolodex of spine-tingling set-pieces involving telephone cords, television screens, and changing rooms, even if many rely too heavily on CGI and feel copy-and-pasted from other movies. Remember Janet's TV terrors in The Conjuring 2, the Nun's fingers curling round Ed's painting, the disappearing dangling feet in the 2013 original?\nRelease date: September 5\nAvailable: In cinemas\nDirector: Michael Chaves\nRuntime: 135 minutes\nIt's not just its own franchise that Last Rites pinches things from, either. In the universe's early days, more visually creative creator James Wan, who directed the first two installments, knew how to make us squirm by lingering a little too long on a dimly lit wide shot or deliberately hiding the monsters. This is a much bloodier, louder, in-your-face affair than any of the previous Conjuring flicks, which more closely evokes the likes of Insidious and even Evil Dead. Hell, all the menacing mirror stuff is reminiscent of Mike Flanagan's second-ever feature, Oculus. The result? An energetic, fast-paced outing (its lengthy 135-minute runtime whizzes by), robbed of some of that signature Conjuring style.\nOpting for thrills rather than chills gives the sequel a rather odd tone, too, with the \"more fun\" vibes paving the way for gags, MCU-style cameos, and references that border on self-parody. You'll be pointing to the screen like that Leonardo DiCaprio meme whenever someone says \"conduit\", \"ritualistic practice\" or \"nothing's a toy, not even the toys\". In the same vein, we wouldn't recommend anyone play a drinking game while watching that involves taking a swig every time ol' Annabelle pops up. You won't make it to the end credits.\nFamily at the forefront\nWhile The Devil Made Me Do It saw the Warrens take a little bit of a backseat, Last Rites takes the criticisms levelled at its predecessor and course corrects, ensuring that all of the film's emotional throughlines stem from the Warren family. (Though that does come at the cost of connecting with the Smurls' plight or getting any context on the motives of its multiple villains).\nTurns out, back in 1964, Ed and Lorraine almost suffered an unspeakable tragedy \u2013 and this new case is bringing up painful memories from Judy's first few days Earth-side. The now 20-something, a gifted medium like her mother, has been unwillingly tuning into more spiritual horrors of late, which worries Lorraine. Ed (depicted a little too much like a bumbling, backward-looking bloke here), however, is more concerned by her whirlwind relationship with breezy, blonde ex-cop Tony (Ben Hardy). Having acted alongside one another for 13 years now, the easy chemistry between Farmiga and Wilson is palpable; embodying more of a mature, lived-in comfortability than swoon-worthy flirtation. No Elvis-themed serenades this time around. Writers Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, instead, leave the sparkly-eyed romance stuff to Hardy and Tomlinson, who fare decently enough under the imposing shadow of the leads' couple goals.\nThe movie concludes with some text that spells out what happened to the real-life Ed and Lorraine following the Smurl case, making clear that this'll be the last time we see them on the big screen. Not disastrous but disappointing all the same, The Conjuring 4 is a serviceable sequel that commits the ultimate sin of not being bold or memorable enough for a final chapter \u2013 and that's a shame. In religious circles, \"Last Rites\" also goes by \"Commendation of the Dying\", the Christian practice of offering prayers and support to ease someone's transition into the afterlife. Guess we had a little too much faith that the Warrens wouldn't go out with a whimper.\nThe Conjuring: Last Rites releases on September 5.

      "text": "The most exciting upcoming horror movies coming in 2025 and beyond\nFrom Weapons to Five Nights At Freddy's 2, here are all the new horror movies coming out in 2025!\nThe upcoming horror movies on their way to cinemas and streaming offer a spooky smorgasbord of dark delights, from indie gems to new entries into some of the most familiar genre franchises.\n2025 has already been a stellar year for horror and this ghost train is showing no signs of slowing down, with a bevy of new titles dropping over the next few months to keep us screaming, laughing, cheering, wincing \u2013 and maybe even puking.\nGrotesque body horror Together is coming soon, as is Mother of Flies, the latest film from multitalented filmmakers The Adams Family, both of which are garnering enthusiastic responses from horror critics. Hot on their heels is Chuck Russell\u2019s remake of Witchboard and creepy new Aussie horror Went Up The Hill, plus the latest instalments in popular horror franchises Hell House LLC and V/H/S, and the much anticipated remake of cult classic The Toxic Avenger.\nThe latest \u2013 and final \u2013 movie in The Conjuring series will see Ed and Lorraine Warren return for one last scare, The Long Walk is bringing more Stephen King to our screens (and has just received an R rating), Osgood Perkins is back in the horror game again with his new movie Keeper, and a bunch of sequels are keeping various properties alive with The Strangers: Chapter 2, The Black Phone 2 and Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s 2 all on their way. Plus more familiar titles from Predator: Badlands to Frankenstein to Anaconda will be fulfilling fans for months to come.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the most exciting upcoming horror films headed our way\u2026\nTogether\nRelease date: July 30, 2025 (US), August 15, 2025 (UK)\nWritten and directed by Michael Shanks in his feature debut, and starring IRL couple Alison Brie (GLOW, Horse Girl, The Rental) and Dave Franco (Nerve, Love Lies Bleeding), Together recently premiered as part of the Sundance Midnight selection at January\u2019s film festival. According to Variety, the film kept the packed audience hooting and hollering at many of its gory, surprising set pieces, and in an interview for IMDb, Franco described the film as \"very scary\".\nGet sneak previews, exclusive competitions and details of special events each month!\nThe psychological sci-fi body horror follows a codependent couple's move to the countryside which triggers a supernatural incident that exacerbates their existing issues and drastically alters their relationship\u2026 and their physical form.\nWitchboard\nRelease date: August 15, 2025\nIn the late eighties, director Chuck Russell treated horror fans to two much-loved favourites: A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors in \u201887 and a brilliant remake of The Blob in \u201888, but then he moved away from the genre. Well he\u2019s finally back, with a reimagining of the 1986 cult classic Witchboard and, since Russell has stated \u201cI wanted to top my other two horror films\u201d, we are excited about it!\nStarring Madison Iseman (Annabelle Comes Home, I Know What You Did Last Summer series), Aaron Dominguez (Only Murders in the Building), Mel Jarnson (Mortal Kombat) and Charlie Tahan (The Pale Blue Eye, Ozark), Witchboard follows a group of friends who discover a mysterious artifact as they prepare to open a cafe in New Orleans. Cue darkness, obsession, summoned spirits, mysterious occult experts and a sumptuous masked ball, all under Chuck Russell\u2019s well-trained eye.\nWent Up The Hill\nRelease date: August 15, 2025\nAntipodean horror has a rich history and is currently having a bit of a moment, with the Philippou brothers\u2019 sophomore effort Bring Her Back and serial killer/shark movie Dangerous Animals already proving popular with audiences this year. Samuel Van Grinsven is a New Zealand-born writer and director based in Sydney and his new film is his first foray into horror following his 2019 breakout Sequin in a Blue Room. In Went Up The Hill, Dacre Montgomery (Stranger Things, Better Watch Out) plays Jack, a young man who ventures to a remote part of New Zealand for the funeral of his estranged mother and meets her widow Jill, played by the brilliant Vicky Krieps (Old, Phantom Thread). But his mother's spirit returns to inhabit each of their bodies, turning this into a bold new ghost story that we\u2019re very excited for.\nShelby Oaks\nRelease date: August 21, 2025\nThis indie horror movie written and directed by Chris Stuckmann in his feature debut was made with support from a campaign on Kickstarter and has recently welcomed Mike Flanagan as an executive producer. Shelby Oaks is shot as a traditional feature, but has some interesting elements of found footage, and follows Mia, a woman on a desperate search for Riley, her missing paranormal investigator sister.\n\"As Mia uncovers new and disturbing leads related to Riley\u2019s disappearance, she uncovers evidence of a hidden supernatural evil dating all the way back to [their] childhood.\" Camille Sullivan, who starred in 2020\u2019s exceptional horror/thriller Hunter Hunter plays Mia, and is joined by Brendan Sexton (Welcome to the Dollhouse, Session 9, Don\u2019t Breathe 2), Michael Beach (Insidious: Chapter 2, Saw X) and the legendary Keith David (The Thing, They Live, Nope).\nHell House LLC: Lineage\nRelease date: August 20, 2025\nAre you ready to return to the haunt? The Hell House LLC franchise is coming back with its fifth \u2013 and possibly final \u2013 installment, further exploring the backstories of the series\u2019 characters and introducing some new ones to the mix. Unlike the four previous movies, starting with Hell House LLC in 2015, Lineage won\u2019t be a found footage horror and will present its terrors in more of a traditional cinematic narrative. But fans shouldn\u2019t worry \u2013 Elizabeth Vermilyea, Cayla Berejikian, Victoria Andrunik, Gideon Berger, Bridget Rose Perrotta, Destiny Brown and James Liddell all return, as does the franchise\u2019s genuinely terrifying clown.\nMother of Flies\nRelease date: August 25, 2025\nThere are some creators who are, frankly, just a little too talented, and The Adams Family, the multiskilled lineage who brought us the brilliant Hellbender (2021) and The Deeper You Dig (2019), are a perfect example. They're now back with their latest feature, Mother of Flies, in which a young woman faces a deadly diagnosis and seeks dark magic from a witch in the woods before she learns that every cure has its costs. Produced, written, directed, scored and edited by Toby Poser, John Adams and Zelda Adams, who also star, alongside Lulu Adams, Mother of Flies is the hotly anticipated new horror movie from this much-revered indie filmmaking clan.\nThe Toxic Avenger\nRelease date: August 29, 2025\nThe reboot of the 1984 Troma Entertainment comedy-horror cult classic got its world premier at Fantastic Fest in September 2023 and then disappeared into the distribution void but now, thanks to Cineverse having picked it up, we finally have a release date. Macon Blair, best known as the director of 2017\u2019s indy favourite I Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore and his acting turns in a whole host of genre fair including Blue Ruin, Green Room and The Hunt, feels like a safe pair of hands for this retelling of the tale of The Toxic Avenger \u2013 a mutated anti-hero who wields a deadly mop. Peter Dinklage is in the title role, alongside Kevin Bacon, Jacob Tremblay and Elijah Wood, and this should be one on the radar for anyone with a penchant for schlocky gore, quirky comedy and practical effects.\nThe Conjuring: Last Rites\nRelease date: September 5, 2025\nAnd now the end is near, and so we face the final Conjuring. For over a decade now, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga have been battling the forces of supernatural evil as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, and now they\u2019re ready to hang up their holy water, big collars and guitars in the fourth and final installment, The Conjuring: Last Rites.\nJames Wan\u2019s Conjuring Universe is a box office juggernaut that has grossed around $2.2 billion over eight mixed but largely enjoyable movies to date, making it the most successful horror franchise ever and rehabilitating the controversial real-life Warrens as modern-day genre faves. Michael Chaves is back on directing duty for Last Rites after helming other franchise entries, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, The Nun II, and The Curse of La Llorona, and the new film will see Ed and Lorraine taking on one last terrifying case.\nThe Long Walk\nRelease date: September 12, 2025\nThere\u2019s a new Stephen King adaptation on the horizon and the straight-up talent involved in The Long Walk is hugely exciting. Directed by Francis Lawrence (Constantine, I Am Legend, the Hunger Games movies), with a screenplay by JT Mollner (Strange Darling) and starring Mark Hamill (Star Wars, The Fall of the House of Usher), Judy Greer (Halloween, Halloween Kills) and Garrett Wareing (God is a Bullet), that\u2019s a lot of impressive names, especially when paired with one of King\u2019s most ambitious novels (written under the pseudonym Richard Bachman).\nThe dystopian horror revolves around a group of teenage boys who sign up for an annual contest known as The Long Walk, where they must maintain a certain walking speed or get shot. It shares some themes with The Hunger Games and Battle Royale, but the brutal, heart-stopping horror is mixed with that small town sepia Americana that King does so well. We can\u2019t wait.\nHim\nRelease date: September 19, 2025\nSports and horror might not be two themes that are often explored together in cinema, but the new movie from director Justin Tipping (Kicks) and Jordan Peele's Monkeypaw Productions (the studio behind Peele's Get Out, Us and Nope, and 2021's Candyman) is about to change all that. Him stars Tyriq Withers (Atlanta) as a promising young football player who joins an isolated compound to train under a dynasty team's aging quarterback, played by Marlon Wayans (Requiem for a Dream, Scary Movie). Alongside Withers and Wayans, the cast also includes Julia Fox (Uncut Gems, Presence) and Tim Heidecker (Us, Y2K).\nThe Strangers: Chapter 2\nRelease date: September 26, 2025\nThe second installment of Renny Harlin\u2019s The Strangers trilogy is headed to theaters this September, continuing the story from 2024\u2019s Chapter 1 in which Madelaine Petsch\u2019s Maya found herself at the mercy of the now-iconic masked psychopaths: The Man in Mask, Dollface and Pin-Up girl, first introduced in Bryan Bertino\u2019s original 2008 home invasion horror. The Strangers: Chapter 2 is clocking up a run-time of well over two and a half hours so, following the lukewarm critical response to last year\u2019s franchise entry, there should be plenty of room for the horror to stretch its legs and hopefully deliver some compelling storytelling and visceral scares to gear up to Chapter 3\u2019s forthcoming conclusion.\nKeeper\nRelease date: October 3, 2025\nExciting news, Osgood Perkins fans! Not content with releasing one of the best and biggest horror films of 2024 with Longlegs, and then treating us hot on its heels to the highly entertaining gorefest that was The Monkey in February, the director is gearing up to deliver yet another descent into darkness before the year is out.\nTatiana Maslani and Tess Degenstein - who both worked with Perkins on The Monkey - will star alongside Rossif Sutherland (Orphan: First Kill, Possessor) in Keeper, set to hit cinemas in October. Sutherland and Maslani play a couple - Malcolm and Liz - who set out on a romantic anniversary retreat, but when Malcolm unexpectedly leaves for the city, Liz is left alone to be confronted by a sinister presence within their remote cabin. You keep making them Oz, and we\u2019ll keep watching them.\nBone Lake\nRelease date: October 3, 2025\nThe new erotic psychological horror film from director Mercedes Bryce Morgan, who in 2022 made the very solid Spoonful of Sugar for Shudder, sees a couple's vacation at a secluded estate upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. With the tagline 'What's your body count?', Bone Lake had its world premiere at last year's Fantastic Fest, and will arrive on our screens just before Halloween. It's a darkly hilarious and seductive horror story in which a dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies and manipulation, bringing terrifying secrets to light and triggering a bloody battle for survival.\nV/H/S/Halloween\nRelease date: October 3, 2025\nThe V/H/S franchise has very much embraced October as its domain in recent years, making each new installment a staple of Spooky Season for horror fans, and this year it\u2019s leaning in hard. The eighth entry in the cult horror anthology franchise, which started back in 2012, promises a seasonal twist, with segments themed around traditional Halloween horrors. V/H/S/Halloween will hit the Shudder streaming service on October 3rd and, as always, boasts an impressive roster of directors, from Bryan M. Ferguson, Casper Kelly, Micheline Pitt-Norman and R.H. Norman to Alex Ross Perry (Your Smell), Anna Zlokovic (Appendage) and Paco Plaza (the REC movies, La Abuela, Veronica and Sister Death).\nThe Black Phone 2\nRelease date: October 17, 2024\nWe love a horror sequel that audiences are actually excited about and Scott Derrickson\u2019s follow-up to his 2021 supernatural/child abduction hit The Black Phone is shaping up to be one such movie. There\u2019s very little known about The Black Phone 2 currently, but it has been confirmed that original cast members Ethan Hawke, Jeremy Davies, Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw are all returning.\nThe first movie and its characters were based on a short story written by Joe son-of-Stephen-King Hill, and while he won\u2019t back for the sequel screenplay, Derrickson has teamed up again with C. Robert Cargill who also worked on The Black Phone and the Sinister films. Here\u2019s hoping for more fearful fun from this team that just seems to love the horror genre.\nPredator: Badlands\nRelease date: November 7, 2025\nThe plot of Predator: Badlands, the upcoming new entry in the juggernaut franchise that has been pulling in audiences since 1987, is currently under wraps, but we do know a few details. Firstly, it\u2019s directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who is back with the franchise after he stunned in 2022 with his Comanche Nation-set Predator movie Prey, and secondly, it stars Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon, The Beguiled).\nHowever, it\u2019s perhaps the protagonist of the new movie that has had people most excited, after Trachtenberg revealed that it\u2019s the Predator itself that will be taking center stage. Filming has wrapped in New Zealand, whose dramatic landscapes will stand in for the alien planet where the story\u2019s action takes place.\nFrankenstein\nRelease date: November 2025\nThe long-awaited adaptation of Mary Shelley's seminal sci-fi horror story Frankenstein by celebrated genre director Guillermo del Toro (Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, The Devil\u2019s Backbone, Hellboy, Crimson Peak, The Shape of Water) now has a release month of November, when it will hit audiences' homes on Netflix. Del Toro\u2019s narrative (he\u2019s co-credited as writer with Shelley) revolves around Christoph Waltz\u2019s Dr. Pretorius who tracks down the iconic Monster (Jacob Elordi) \u2013 believed to have died in a fire decades before \u2013 in order to continue the experiments of Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac). The all-star cast also includes Mia Goth, Ralph Ineson and Charles Dance. Electrifying!\nFive Nights At Freddy's 2\nRelease date: December 5, 2025\nIn 2023, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s became Blumhouse\u2019s highest-grossing movie of all time, and the cast and crew behind the popular video game-based smash hit is coming back with its sequel at the end of 2025. The first film followed Josh Hutcherson\u2019s Mike, a troubled security guard who gets a job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza only to find himself battling killer animatronics.\nDirector Emma Tammi, her co-writers Scott Cawthon and Seth Cuddeback, and stars Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, and Piper Rubio are all returning for Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s 2, which, with the tagline \u2018Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances', and will no doubt take the classic follow-up approach of upping the stakes, the action, and - hopefully - the horror. This is also one of our most anticipated upcoming video game movies of 2025!\nAnaconda\nRelease date: December 25, 2025\nThere\u2019s a big new creature feature on the horizon and, while this might not have been on anyone\u2019s 2025 horror bingo card, it\u2019s a reboot of 1997\u2019s Anaconda being brought to us by Jack Black and Paul Rudd on Christmas Day. Although at first glance this might feel like an unusual project pairing, Black has some monster movie pedigree from Peter Jackson\u2019s King Kong and Rudd is no stranger to blockbuster action, having played Ant-Man across multiple installments of the MCU.\nFrom what we currently know from the synopsis, the new Anaconda movie could well be a meta affair, as a group of friends going through midlife crises decide to remake a favorite movie from their youth but encounter unexpected events (and, we assume, one very big snake) when they enter the jungle. Joining Black and Rudd on the cast are Steve Zahn (Joyride) and Thandiwe Newton (Westworld). Tom Gormican (The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent) will direct.\nThe Bride\nRelease date: March 6, 2026\nMore rebooted Universal Monster action is on its way, this time revolving around one of horror\u2019s most iconic female characters, and directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal \u2013 following her hugely successful feature debut The Lost Daughter in 2021 \u2013 who's adapting the stunning black and white classic from 1935, James Whale\u2019s Bride of Frankenstein. The new movie takes place in '30s Chicago, where Frankenstein asks Dr. Euphronius for help creating a companion, and when they bring a murdered woman back to life as the Bride (played by Men\u2019s Jessie Buckley), they spark romance, police interest, and radical social change.\nAlong with its significant heritage, an impressive ensemble cast including Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Life, Velvet Buzzsaw), Christian Bale (American Psycho, The Pale Blue Eye), Penelope Cruz (Vanilla Sky, Murder on the Orient Express), Peter Sarsgaard (The Skeleton Key, Orphan) and Annette Bening (Mars Attacks!) makes this another hugely anticipated horror for 2025.\nFor more, check out our guides to all the movie release dates this year and new TV shows.\nBecky Darke is a London-based podcaster and writer, with her sights on film, horror and 90s pop-culture.

      "text": "In a tumultuous Hollywood age of corporate takeovers and executive turnovers, Richard Brener is a rarity of the business. The tall, soft-spoken president and CCO of New Line has been at company for 30, yes, you read that right, 30 years come May 1. He started as a temp in Los Angeles, working in every conceivable department. Then, when a story editor position opened up, applied for the job. That gig instead went to a woman named Donna Langley, now the chairman NBCU Entertainment & Studios, but then an executive\u2019s assistant. \u201cThat was smart of them because she\u2019s obviously done very, very well for herself,\u201d Brener notes while sitting in New Line\u2019s offices on the Burbank lot of Warner Bros. Discovery. \u201cShe\u2019s now a dame and I\u2019m just a mister.\u201d But New Line execs were impressed enough with the Yale history grad that they created the position of staff reader just for him.\nRelated Stories\nBrener got his big break when he was installed to oversee an Adam Sandler movie titled The Wedding Singer, which proved to be a massive (and enduring) hit in 1998. The feature helped propel him into the upper ranks of New Line, where he has been one of the executives responsible for some of the biggest comedies and horror movies of the century, ranging from Wedding Crashers and Horrible Bosses to The Conjuring franchise and It movies. In fact, five of the top 10 horror movies of all time have been made during his tenure there.\nThis year, Brener, ably assisted by longtime executive Dave Neustadter and New Line\u2019s spry lean team, is overseeing a slate that comprises nearly half of WBD\u2019s film output, and that has taken an outsized importance. While Warner Bros. Motion Pictures heads Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy have been under scrutiny for taking expensive swings with risky auteur-driven movies, WBD head David Zaslav and company insiders have pointed to New Line\u2019s mostly horror-driven lineup of sequels (Mortal Kombat II, The Conjuring: Last Rites) and reboots (Final Destination: Bloodlines) as the surefire counterweight.\nOn the heels of WBD\u2019s Cinemacon presentation, Brener peels back the curtain on his time as a reader, the stomach-churning anxiety of corporate mergers, and the future of Conjuring and Friday (and more!) franchises.\nYou started as a reader and story editor with Mike De Luca running the show. What was a script that got away from you guys?\nWe bid on American Pie and got outbid. That one hurt. This one is later, but Straight Outta Compton we developed for years and put the movie together only for the higher-ups to let it go. That wouldn\u2019t have happened if Mike and Pam were in charge of the studio then.\nWhat was it like when you first read Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Boogie Nights?\nI was a story editor at the time, and I had to make copies of that script. It was 180 pages or something like that. I will say that as a giant fan of the movie, I absolutely did not get it from the page. I remember thinking Mike was the best executive in the world. To see something that would eventually become one of my favorite movies and not see it on the page was very intimidating and humbling. It read like a hardcore porn script. It was pretty racy. I remember thinking, \u201cthis is going to be a movie of all unknowns and it\u2019s going to be NC 17 and it is 180 pages. This is crazy.\u201d And then I heard that they were interested in Drew Barrymore to play Roller Girl. It ended up obviously being Heather Graham, but the second I heard that, it kind of clicked in my head, and I got it. It didn\u2019t even occur to me that it could be cast up. And to Mike\u2019s credit, he obviously did see that.\nNew Line at that time was considered one the wildest and untamed studios of the \u201990s.\nAnd yet we\u2019re the most stable in terms of how many leaders there have been. Isn\u2019t that ironic?\nVery. What is the wildest thing you saw that you shouldn\u2019t recount but I\u2019m going to ask you to anyway?\nI wasn\u2019t necessarily privy maybe to do the reputational \u201cwild moments,\u201d but I do remember our Christmas parties, which were public. They were a lot of fun. I remember walking by Quentin Tarantino, who was at one of our parties saying, \u201cI want to make movies at this company!\u201d just because our Christmas party was fun. And I think at all of the New Line premieres, the New Line executives were the last to leave usually. It was a very fun place.\nNew Line has gone through merger hell and restructuring several times. What\u2019s been the closest you felt that the company would be shut down?\nPretty much whenever there was a change of ownership, the headline would say the new owner, and then the sub-headline would say \u201cNew Line likely to be shuttered.\u201d But the scariest time was 2008 when the company got downsized from 600 to 40. We lost all of the international department, all the distribution, all of home video. Everybody but maybe one or two marketing people, one or two in some of the other divisions. We were in the Pacific Design Center and we were hearing from Jeff Bewkes coming live from the CNN Center to tell us that there were going to be a lot of big changes and a lot of people in that room weren\u2019t going to be a part of \u2019em. And then we went on a crazy hot streak [Including He\u2019s Just Not That Into You, 17 Again, Sex and the City, Four Christmases.] I think our first 14 movies were profitable. And then after the first one that didn\u2019t work, they cut 30 percent of our overhead.\nWhat is the movie that broke the hot streak?\nGoing the Distance. But, the best part of that movie, it was the first movie we worked with Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day. Whatever we lost on that movie, we made tenfold from making Horrible Bosses. So even that frown can be turned upside down.\nSpeaking of turning things around, the testing process is big at New Line. What\u2019s been the movie that\u2019s tested the worst that you\u2019ve managed to save?\nI\u2019m definitely not answering that. I\u2019ll just say that in the beginning of my career, if something didn\u2019t test well early, I would panic. And now, I cannot be phased by low scores. Post is a magical place. Some of our biggest successful movies at one point weren\u2019t testing well. I feel for the filmmakers we work with \u2014 a lot of first-timers who probably feel like it\u2019s life or death, but it\u2019s a really fun process.\nHow has New Line evolved over the years?\nIt\u2019s not been a huge change in the sense that we\u2019ve kind of been making the same kinds of movies, whether it\u2019s horror, comedy, or female-driven films. The budgets haven\u2019t changed, the expectations don\u2019t change and the pressure doesn\u2019t change. There\u2019s an ebb and flow in the sense that we probably are making less comedies today and more horror movies, because horror movies have been working more and there are people who are nervous about comedies, I think unjustifiably.\nYou guys have a slate with a majority of sequels. And companies get knocked for that.\nWe take our sequels very seriously and try to make them feel as fresh as possible. I think we have a really great track record on sequels. We are on the sixth Final Destination, the ninth Conjuring film and the fourth Mortal Kombat this year. I think a lot of companies probably run out of steam by two and three. So the hope is that none of the sequels feel like stale and familiar. But we also have Companion and Weapons this year as kind of original movies. I\u2019d love to get credit for having a super big plan, but a lot of movies, you kind of have to react to how they come in and when they\u2019re ready.\nLet\u2019s talk about the slate for a bit. Companion came out earlier in the year. Why didn\u2019t that work at the box office?\nI am confounded about that, to be honest. I think it\u2019s very rare to find a movie that scores as well with the audience and critics. There may be some things in the concept that were hard to get through in short form in marketing, but we\u2019re super proud of the movie and would love to work with [writer-director] Drew [Hancock] again. He\u2019s an amazing talent. The movie will be profitable for us.\nFor Final Destination, I heard directors Zack Lipovsky and Adam Stein made a crazy video when pitching for the gig. Can you tell me about that?\nThey basically Final Destination-ed themselves in the middle of their pitch. So they died while pitching it, and it was very shocking, very surprising, and really clever. Also, the way they storyboarded everything and explained all the scenes was very unique. They were incredible, and very clever with the way they used technology on top of just great filmmaking.\nHow much more gas is there in the Conjuring tank?\nIt\u2019s testing through the roof and we\u2019re only at the director\u2019s cut, the 10-week part of the movie where you\u2019re normally very, very scared about the status of your film. We\u2019re very early in the process, have very preliminary visual effects, but it\u2019s already through the roof. So while this is the last of what we call phase one, we are hopeful that we can make more.\nOh, so you guys are MCU-ing this? What\u2019s phase two?\nPhase two is TBD.\nWhere is the next Conjuring coming from?\nWe have a lot of great stuff in the works, and we\u2019re also making our second Evil Dead movie with plans for a third as well. But there are also new fresh ones that you haven\u2019t heard of that we believe, in success, we\u2019ll have multiple installments.\nLike Weapons?\nWe\u2019ll see. It\u2019s a very unique movie and I don\u2019t want to say too much about, it because it\u2019s going to blow people\u2019s minds.\nLightning round on New Line titles! Is there a new Nightmare on Elm Street on the Horizon?\nWe hope so. It\u2019s complicated because of the rights.\nWould you remake The Mask?\nUnder the right circumstances, the right filmmakers, the right talent? Yes. It\u2019s a great idea for a movie.\nAny new Friday movies?\nWe are making another Friday. We just closed a deal with Ice Cube to write and star. It\u2019s going to be called Last Friday.\nSequel to Seven?\nNo.\nYou could call it Eight.\nNo. I mean, if David Fincher wanted to do it, sure.\nWhat about Snakes on a Plane? Snakes on Train, Planes and Automobiles?\nThere have been conversations about those kinds of things or other things on a plane. But no current plans.\nYou guys made three Blade movies. Marvel hasn\u2019t made any. Do you have any advice for them?\nI am not giving Marvel any advice. But I\u2019m happy to take some if they are so willing.\nWhat are the three most important lessons you\u2019ve learned about the movie business?\nFirst, the problems in the script will become problems in the movie. If you think that someone can fix it, or the audience won\u2019t see it, whatever \u2014 not true. Second, I would say the audience is always right. Which means never under or overestimate them. If you build it, they will come, if you make it for them. We love the testing process, so fix your movies because that investment in your time and money will pay off during the giant life cycle of a film. Movies are forever, so make sure you make the best ones. And third, don\u2019t give interviews.\nThis story appeared in the April 2 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "text": "Well, it's official, The Conjuring 4 is set to mark the supernatural swan song of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. Although, perhaps, maybe only on the big screen...\nNew Line Cinema confirmed the news while revealing that the horror sequel will release in US theaters on September 5, 2025, as franchise creator James Wan took to his Instagram to share Rotten Tomatoes' write-up of the story and mark the \"end of an era\". While he's not directed an installment since The Conjuring 2 in 2016, the filmmaker expressed his sadness over its conclusion with a teary-eyed emoji.\nReleased in 2013, The Conjuring was inspired by the real-life case files of the aforementioned demonologists. Set in the early 1970s, it sees Ed and Lorraine travel out to Rhode Island to help the Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) and her family rid their home of an evil entity.\nDue to its box-office success and critical acclaim, the original has so far spawned two sequels -- The Conjuring 2 and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It -- and multiple spin-offs, such as Annabelle, The Nun, and The Curse of La Llorona. As it stands, the series has made a whopping $2.3 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing horror franchise ever.

We see a disembodied hand grasp a shoulder, blood and hair pour out of someone's mouth, and a gruesome hanging that all culminate in Ed performing an exorcism as flames begin to erupt. Oh, and, there's a flash of everyone's favorite scary doll, Annabelle. Loraine tells Ed that there's a familiar evil around them, one that seems to know them already.\nThe Conjuring: Last Rites marks the last outing for stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Loraine Warren, as the couple take on their final case and try to vanquish a demon from a family's home. The movie also stars Mia Tomlinson as Ed and Lorraine\u2019s daughter, Judy Warren, and Ben Hardy as her boyfriend, Tony Spera. Steve Coulter is also returning as Father Gordon.\nLast Rites is actually based on a real-life case known as The Smurl Haunting. Between 1974 and 1989, Jack and Janet Smurl of West Pittston, Pennsylvania, claimed that a demon was haunting their home, causing loud noises, bad odors, and even pushing one of their daughters down a flight of stairs on one instance, and seriously assaulting another family member. In 1986, the Warrens finally paid a visit to the family.\nThe movie is directed by Michael Chaves, the same filmmaker behind The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, The Nun 2, and The Curse of La Llorona. The Conjuring director and franchise creator James Wan serves as producer, alongside Peter Safran, who has also worked on The Conjuring movies since the very start.\nThe Conjuring: Last Rites hits theaters on September 5, 2025.

      "text": "The Conjuring: Last Rites director says now is the right time to say goodbye to Ed and Lorraine Warren: \"We don't want this to be a series that gets run into the ground\"\nExclusive: Director Michael Chaves said he felt the pressure in taking on the Warrens' final case in The Conjuring: Last Rites,\nSoon horror fans will witness stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga make their last outing as Ed and Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring: Last Rites, but with directing the final Conjuring movie as we know it comes great responsibility, as director Michael Chaves knows all too well.\n\"I thought it was an incredible opportunity,\" said Chaves in an interview with GamesRadar+. This not Chaves' first rodeo when it comes to the horror franchise, as he previously directed The Nun II, The Curse of La Llorona, and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. But, since the franchise was created by James Wan, who directed the first two Conjuring movies, Chaves says he \"felt all the pressure\" in taking on the Warrens' final installment.\nDespite the pressure, Chaves says he ultimately wanted to \"make something that felt really special for fans who have grown up with the franchise. \"I grew up on, like, Nightmare on Elm Street \u2013 that was my first horror movie. And I know so many people that, this is the movie they grew up on,\" says Chaves. \"This is the movie that they saw when they were 11, 12 years old at a slumber party. It was their first horror movie\u2026 so I know what it means to so many people, and I totally knew the responsibility going in.\u201d\nThe Conjuring universe launched with The Conjuring in 2013, and has since spanned 9 movies, including multiple The Nun and Anabelle spin-offs, right up to The Conjuring: Last Rites. But everything good must come to an end, as the fourth The Conjuring film explores the Warrens' final case, where they take on a demonic presence lurking in the Smurl family home.\nWhen asked why now is the right time to say goodbye to the Warrens, Chaves says: \"I think you want to end on a high point. I think it was something that everybody had the confidence to say, you know, we're in a great space with this, with a series, and we don't want this to be a series that just kind of gets [run] into the ground. We wanted to end with confidence and on our own terms.\u201d\nHowever, just because The Warrens' Conjuring is over, doesn't mean we won't get any more movies, as New Line Cinema's president Richard Brener told The Hollywood Reporter that Last Rites is just the end of The Conjuring phase one.\nThe Conjuring: Last Rites hits screens on September 5.
