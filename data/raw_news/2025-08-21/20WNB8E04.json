  "title": "AAXA M8 Ultra Short Throw Projector Review: Up Close, a Reasonable Value",
  "description": "The AAXA M8 combines the convenience of an ultra short throw with portability, a low price, and a relatively bright image, making this projector worth considering for home entertainment or business presentations.",
  "content": "The M8 shares more design basics with the UL5 than just an ultra short throw. Also, aside from the lens, both have more in common with other mini projectors than with larger UST models. The display chip in both cases offers a 960-by-540-pixel matrix in combination with TI's XPR pixel shifting to generate the full 1,920-by-1,080-pixel image on screen. As with most current 1080p models, the M8 can accept 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) input and downconvert the image to 1080p. However, it's limited to a refresh rate of 30Hz, making it suitable for watching movies at 4K/24Hz, but not for gaming at 4K/60Hz.\n\nBoth models also use tri-color red/green/blue laser light sources, an increasingly common choice even for mini projectors. One difference between the two is that AAXA claims a 50% longer lifetime for the M8's light source, at 30,000 hours. AAXA also claims a higher brightness, but the ratings for the two aren't comparable. The UL5's rating is in ANSI lumens, while AAXA uses \"laser lumens,\" which isn't a standard. (More on the M8's brightness later.)\n\nSetting up the M8 is easy. At 3.0 by 4.8 by 8.1 inches (HWD) and a mere 2.7 pounds, it's easy to position, and its powered focus lets you stand back far enough to see the whole image at once while you focus. It also has rubber feet on two sides. One set is on the bottom when you've set up the projector to use a screen or wall. The other is on the side that would normally face the screen; it becomes the bottom when you set the unit to point down to project an image on a tabletop or floor.\n\nThe built-in streaming feature doesn't require any setup. However, it's built on Android version 9, which has apps designed for touch screens rather than remotes. AAXA says the feature is included for commercial customers who want to load their own apps, and it explicitly recommends that others use a third-party streaming stick instead. If you'd rather not bring or buy your own, you can use the preinstalled apps, including Max, Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, and Chrome, or install others. To use the built-in streaming feature, you'll need to connect a mouse to the USB port or control an on-screen mouse (somewhat clumsily) through the remote.\n\nTwo better alternatives for streaming are to follow AAXA's recommendation to plug a third-party dongle into one of the two HDMI 1.4 ports or mirror a phone or other device. The M8 supports DLNA mirroring as well as MiraCast for Android and AirPlay for iOS. (The iOS devices have to be connected to the same network, while Android devices can connect directly to the projector.) AAXA also provides a USB-C-to-USB-C cable for mirroring without going through a network, and the projector also has a USB Type-A port and a microSD/TF card slot for reading files from USB sticks and memory cards.\n\nIn testing, the 4-watt stereo audio system delivered good enough sound quality for casual viewing at enough volume to fill a family room. For better quality and higher volume, you can connect an external sound system via the TOSLink optical audio output, the 3.5mm stereo output, or Bluetooth.",
