  "description": "America\u2019s farmers are expecting bumper crops this fall, but they\u2019ve got little idea of where all the supplies will go. China, historically the biggest buyer of US soybeans, hasn\u2019t inked a deal for a single cargo from this year\u2019s harvest, which starts next month.",
  "content": "Sunny skies and mild temperatures this week greeted the biggest U.S. farm show of the year. The contrast couldn\u2019t be greater with the sentiment among attendees as low crop prices and trade tariffs squeeze the agricultural sector.\n\nThe market for American crops is getting \u201cpretty nasty,\u201d said Scott Metzger, who drove more than 300 miles to attend. That helped to keep the mood subdued at the Farm Progress Show this week in Illinois.\n\nMetzger grows soybeans, corn and wheat in central Ohio, and he said farmers are dealing with too much chaos to think about spending this year on big-ticket items like the gleaming tractors and combines on display. It\u2019s the latest sign of trouble for the farm economy.\n\nAmerica\u2019s farmers are expecting bumper crops this fall, but they\u2019ve got little idea of where all the supplies will go. China, historically the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, hasn\u2019t inked a deal for a single cargo from this year\u2019s harvest, which starts next month. Blowback from President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has served to further chill the administration\u2019s already icy relationship with the Asian country.\n\nTariff tensions are making the North American farm market the most uncertain in the world even as conditions in Europe and Asia start to improve, according to Gerrit Marx, chief executive officer of CNH Industrial NV, which unveiled some its latest machinery at the show. There are so many unknowns in the agricultural economy, several companies that had a significant presence at the annual gathering in 2024 ended up skipping altogether this year, which included seed maker Corteva Inc. and the world\u2019s top fertilizer producer Nutrien Ltd.\n\n\u201cFarming in the U.S. will change,\u201d Marx said in an interview, noting that growers are trying to figure out how to adapt to shifting conditions.\n\n\u201cThe fields will all be green. The question is: What grows? And for what purpose? And at what price?\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes time for those chess pieces to move around the board, and we\u2019re kind of in that period today.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s farmers, a key voting bloc for President Donald Trump, are growing increasingly worried as harvest approaches.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture is forecasting a record corn crop for the season starting in September. While the soy harvest is expected to be smaller than last year after farmers planted less, yields are on track to hit a new high. That means farmers will face a mountain of supplies just as trade tensions with China dim prospects for American exports. Crop prices have been depressed as a result. Tariffs are also raising costs for key farm inputs like fertilizer, adding to the financial strain.\n\nThe American Soybean Association has warned that growers are near a \u201ctrade and financial precipice\u201d and cannot survive a prolonged trade war with China. The National Corn Growers Association is sounding the alarm over an economic crisis in rural America. Credit conditions for farmers \u201cdeteriorated steadily\u201d in the second quarter, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City report. Bankruptcies are also on the rise.\n\nCompanies including CNH, Deere & Co. and AGCO Corp. showed off their new machines this week at the Illinois farm show. The equipment featured the latest technology \u2014 farmers can now do things like connect tractors to the Internet to help them plant and harvest more accurately while they stay comfortable in air-conditioned cabins. The problem is, few farmers there were looking to buy.\n\nMetzger of Ohio is a sixth-generation farmer who manages more than 3,000 acres with family members. He\u2019s installing some drainage tile in his fields, but not planning for upgrades to his equipment fleet. \u201cWe\u2019re running stuff a little bit longer than what we used to,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThings are tight,\u201d said Metzger, who serves as vice president of the American Soybean Association. \u201cCommodity prices aren\u2019t the highest. Input prices, though, are just astronomical.\u201d\n\nMachinery makers are contending with levies on steel and aluminum, raising U.S. manufacturing costs while demand stays tepid. Deere is laying off dozens of workers at facilities in Iowa and Illinois. The company is also planning to invest almost $20 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade.\n\nMarx of CNH said things could start to rebound from here as farmers adjust to the shifts for trade, turning this year into a \u201ctrough\u201d for the farm-machinery sector, he said.\n\nMatt Jungmann, senior director of events at Farm Progress, said that while purchases of new machinery look light, some growers are making smaller investments. They\u2019re looking at getting new parts or fresh tires, he said.\n\n\u201cThe farmers know these cycles,\u201d Jungmann said. \u201cThere\u2019s still stuff that has to be done.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration did give farmers a boost with increased biofuel blending guidelines for use of fuels made from soy and corn. Crop insurance protection increased with \u201ctransformative changes\u201d under Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n\nEven then, the concerns over trade with China loom large.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of crops this year,\u201d said Eric Hansotia, CEO of AGCO. \u201cSo we need a deal with China. If and when we can get that, that would be a big unlock for the market.\u201d",

      "text": "How stock, bond and other markets have fared so far in 2025\n- Share via\nNEW YORK \u2014 Global financial markets have been turned upside down this year by President Trump\u2019s burgeoning trade war. Markets are not in full panic, but the double-digit declines in major U.S. stock indexes are testing nerves.\nU.S. markets had been on a two-year tear coming into 2025, though many believed that stock prices had become inflated. Trump\u2019s trade war pushed that sentiment into hyperdrive. The Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 has tumbled 13%, and U.S. markets are being outpaced in Europe, Asia and just about everywhere else.\nTrading in traditional \u201csafe havens\u201d such as U.S. Treasurys and the dollar has become erratic and unpredictable.\nOn Monday, the dollar struck a three-year low and U.S. Treasury yields have been soaring. Typically, yields would fall as investors seek a safe place to park their money. U.S. Treasurys no longer appear to provide the shelter they once did.\nOnly gold, a commodity traded internationally, has maintained its reputation as a safe zone. The price of gold is hitting one record high after another.\nHere\u2019s a roundup of what is happening in various segments of the financial markets:\nStocks\nU.S. stocks have been losing ground in a sharp reversal after two years of stellar gains.\nThe S&P 500 index, which is considered a benchmark for the broader market\u2019s health, is down more than 13% in 2025. It gained more than 20% in both 2023 and 2024.\nThe benchmark index is already in a \u201ccorrection,\u201d having fallen more than 10% from the record it set in February. There have been only five weeks in which it\u2019s ended in positive territory this year, and with Monday\u2019s decline it\u2019s moving closer to bear market territory, or a 20% drop from recent highs.\nIt\u2019s worse for the growth-focused Nasdaq composite, which has plunged 19%.\nOverseas markets have largely performed much better than their U.S. counterparts.\nBonds\nTreasurys, typically considered a less risky area of the market, have been volatile throughout the year.\nThe 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates and other loans, was as high as 4.80% in January but then fell until Trump announced the broad details of his tariff policy in early April. Yields then began to surge this month. The recent jump in bond yields, which happens when bond prices fall, reflects rising anxiety about inflation and a potential recession.\nTreasury bonds are essentially IOUs from the U.S. government and they\u2019re how Washington pays its bills. Bond prices typically move in the opposite direction of stock prices, but prices for both have fallen in tandem. That raises more significant concerns, namely a loss of faith in the U.S. as a safe place to invest.\nGold\nIn all of the economic uncertainty, gold is soaring \u2014 setting record after record in 2025.\nThe New York spot gold price hit another all-time high Thursday, closing at about $3,343 per troy ounce \u2014 the standard for measuring precious metals \u2014 according to FactSet. The price is up nearly 27% this year.\nGold futures rose to more than $3,432 on Monday.\nInterest in gold soars in times of uncertainty as investors seek a safe place for their money, although there can still be some volatility. The spot price of gold fell for three straight trading days after Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement on tariffs on April 2, for example, but soon rebounded overall.\nForeign Exchange\nThe U.S. dollar, the world\u2019s reserve currency, is falling under the weight of uncertainty over tariffs, inflation and the direction of the U.S. economy.\nThe U.S. dollar is down a steep 9% for the year when measured against a basket of other currencies, including the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc.\nThe dollar began to erode almost immediately in 2025, but those losses have accelerated over the last two months. A weakened dollar means it is more difficult for the U.S. government, businesses and consumers to borrow money at lower rates. It also means less purchasing power for U.S. consumers and the potential for stunted economic growth.\nOil\nThere is good news and bad news about energy prices. The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. on Monday was $3.15, down sharply from $3.67 at this time last year. That\u2019s the good news.\nThe bad news is that energy prices fall when people start anticipating an economic slowdown. Factories produce less, families call off vacations and businesses cut travel expenses.\nOil prices hit a four-year low this month with anxiety over the effects of tariffs on global economic growth sinking in.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, stood at about $63 per barrel as of midday Monday. That\u2019s down nearly 14% year to date. And Brent crude, the European standard, was just above $66 \u2014 down nearly 13% since the start of 2025.\nEconomists are warning that the steep tariffs Trump is pursuing could cause a recession, which could carry significant implications for the supply chain and jobs in the energy sector.\nBitcoin\nBitcoin has continued to undulate.\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has been on a roller coaster since the start of the year \u2014 with the volatile asset climbing to more than $109,000 ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, only to dip under $75,000 amid wider market sell-offs this month. As of midday Monday, bitcoin\u2019s going price was above $88,000, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThat\u2019s more than $6,000 lower than where bitcoin was trading at the start of 2025 \u2014 but still significantly higher than in recent years. At this time last year, bitcoin traded around $65,000. And in April 2023, months after the November 2022 collapse of FTX crushed crypto, the digital asset went for less than $30,000.\nTrump, once a crypto skeptic, became a major promoter of the industry throughout his campaign \u2014 and last month, he signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.\nGrantham-Philips and Troise write for the Associated Press."

      "text": "- Share via\nYou know, it\u2019s not just the large language models of AI that are hallucinating.\nThe Trump administration is promoting the idea that if it deports all the undocumented farmworkers who plant and pick our crops, the labor gaps will be filled by able-bodied adults currently sitting around the house playing video games and mooching off taxpayers for their publicly funded healthcare.\nThis is absurdity masquerading as arithmetic.\nThe other day, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that, contrary to Trump\u2019s own recent statements, the administration is not planning to back off mass deportations of agricultural workers.\nThe mayor of Perris, Calif., is urging residents to stay indoors and be wary of people they do not know amid ongoing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the area.\n\u201cThe mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way, and we move the workforce towards automation and 100 percent American participation,\u201d she said during an event at U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters. \u201cWith 34 million people, able-bodied adults on Medicaid, we should be able to do that fairly quickly.\u201d\nThat figure is grossly misleading, and a thinly veiled effort to vilify Medicaid \u2014 Medi-Cal in California \u2014 recipients as idle, which, overwhelmingly, they are not. The number of able-bodied Americans on Medicaid who might be able to pick our lettuce and apricots or who might be able to harvest our watermelons and strawberries is closer to 5 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nBut whether the number is 34 million or 5 million, it\u2019s a fantasy to believe that Americans will do the jobs currently filled by migrant farmworkers.\n\u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d said Manuel Cunha, head of the Nisei Farmers League, a grower support organization founded 54 years ago in response to the United Farm Workers labor movement.\nMayor Karen Bass announced a plan Friday to provide direct cash assistance to people who have been affected by the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping immigration raids.\nIn the 1990s, Cunha was involved in a disastrous attempt to get adults off welfare and into the California farming workforce. Growers coordinated with the state\u2019s Employment Development Department, arrangements were made for child care and transportation. And yet, as Cunha told the U.S. Senate\u2019s immigration subcommittee in 1999, only three people showed up to work in the fields. \u201cThere was no interest on the part of welfare individuals to work in agriculture.\u201d\nAnd there is no reason to think that would be any different today.\nFarm work requires skill and physical tenacity that comes from years of experience. You don\u2019t just plop someone into a peach orchard and tell them to go prune a tree. Or let them loose on a strawberry field and expect them to come back the next day. In 2013, my colleague Hector Becerra decided to experience farm labor for himself, and arranged to spend a day picking strawberries in Santa Maria.\nHector Becerra, left, is instructed by foreman Antonio Lopez, right, how to pack a box of strawberries he picked alongside workers in a Santa Maria in 2013. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\nThe experience sounded, frankly, hellish. He worked alongside three dozen Mexican migrants \u201cbent at an almost 90-degree angle, using two hands to pack strawberries into plastic containers that they pushed along on ungainly one-wheeled carts.\u201d\nHe could not keep up with the other pickers, and by lunchtime, Hector wrote, he was sore and exhausted. He lasted little more than seven hours, and then \u201csurrendered.\u201d\nMany of California\u2019s thousands of migrant farmworkers have been here for decades. They cannot easily be replaced. \u201cThey are skilled laborers and their families are part of our small rural communities,\u201d Cunha told me. \u201cMy farmers deserve a workforce that can do the job. Provide them with a work authorization card.\u201d\nIt was only a few years ago, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cunha recalled, that the country heaped praise on farmworkers. \u201cEverybody said they were the most essential front-line workers. Every worker put their life on the line to feed the world, and today we can\u2019t give them a little piece of paper to be here legally?\u201d\nProtesters blocked the roads in and out of one of the farms, and at one point federal agents drove their vehicles through the fields.\nRollins\u2019 claim that growers are moving \u201ctoward automation\u201d is as preposterous as assuming native-born Americans will take to the fields.\n\u201cAs far as automation,\u201d a San Joaquin Valley grower told me, \u201cthere is no automation.\u201d He did not want me to use his name because he\u2019s afraid of calling attention to his fields, where workers are currently harvesting.\n\u201cIf I could replace those 20 people with machines,\u201d he said, \u201cI would.\u201d\nBut melons, strawberries and tree fruit are delicate. (\u201cIf you look at an apricot the wrong way, it will turn brown,\u201d Cunha joked.)\nFarmers can use machines to harvest produce like tomatoes that are destined for a cannery, for example. But when it comes to fresh fruit and vegetables, the grower told me, \u201cThe American consumer wants perfect fruit and there is no machine that can harvest like human hands can.\u201d\nCalifornia and a coalition of 17 other states have backed a lawsuit calling for an end to unconstitutional immigration stops in Los Angeles.\nWe are at this pathetic moment because President Trump\u2019s brand of authoritarianism is incompatible with good faith efforts to find a workable solution to our dysfunctional immigration system.\nWhen it comes to agriculture, hospitality and construction, we need immigrant workers, most of whom are from Mexico. Our economy cannot function without them. In my view, the raids happening at California farms and Home Depot parking lots are a form of state-sponsored terrorism, aimed at instilling fear and panic in hard-working communities. They have no bearing on Trump\u2019s campaign promise to deport violent criminals.\nA U.S. District judge shared tentative ruling that suggests she plans to order federal agents to stop questioning and arresting people without reasonable cause that they have violated immigration laws. Her final ruling is expected Friday.\nIn May, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers, including Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jos\u00e9), offered a new version of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, a comprehensive immigration and labor bill that would offer a path to legalization for some farmworkers, reform and expand the current H-2A guest worker program, allocate funds to improve farmworker housing and require employers to use E-verify for all workers. Similar bills were passed by the House in 2019 and 2021 but died in the Senate at the hands of hard-line immigration critics. This time, Lofgren has said that the Senate will have to take it up first, as her fellow Californian, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove), who chairs the House\u2019s Immigration Subcommittee, does not support it. Don\u2019t hold your breath.\nIn Trump\u2018s world, there is no appetite for real immigration solutions. As many have noted, the president and his supporters are reveling in the violent theater of it all \u2014 the images of masked, armed men terrorizing people in the streets and fields. They see no downside to the cruelty.\nMaybe they will reconsider when crops rot in the fields, hotel rooms stay dirty and construction sites are stilled. One day, the bill for this folly will come due.\nBluesky: @rabcarian\nThreads: @rabcarian\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

      "text": "Trump official suggests Medicaid recipients, automation can replace immigrant workers. California farmers disagree\n- Share via\nA top Trump administration official\u2019s claim that Medicaid recipients could replace farmworkers has met with pushback from California\u2019s agriculture industry, which faces the loss of its workforce amid the federal immigration crackdown.\n\u201cThere will be no amnesty. The mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way,\u201d said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins at a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. \u201cAnd we move the workforce towards automation and 100% American participation, which, again, with 34 million people, able-bodied adults on Medicaid, we should be able to do that fairly quickly.\u201d\nCommunity organizers say at least 35 people were arrested as federal immigration agents swept through Ventura County farms and packinghouses this week.\nHelen McGrath, whose family farms citrus and avocados in Ventura County, said Rollins\u2019 comments were insulting.\n\u201cI can confidently say that most farmers in the country either laughed out loud or were just deflated by those comments,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just shows how uninformed and out of touch some of these officials are with what food production looks like in this country.\u201d\nAccording to 2022 figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 42% of crop farmworkers had no work authorization, with California having the highest share of unauthorized workers.\nImmigration raids at farms, ranches and dairies have recently targeted operations in Ventura County, as well as those in other states, such as Nebraska. Many farmers reported their workers had stayed home for days after such enforcement actions out of fear of arrest.\nLast month, President Trump acknowledged concerns among agriculture industry leaders that recent immigration enforcement was taking away critical workers. That led to a pause of worksite raids in the agriculture, hotel and restaurant sectors.\nDays later, though, his administration reversed course.\nRollins acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of noise in the last few days and a lot of questions about where the president stands in his vision for farm labor.\u201d\nShe said that when she and Trump have spoken about mass deportations, he has agreed that they must be carried out strategically \u201cso as to not compromise our food supply.\u201d\nJuan Proa\u00f1o, chief executive of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a national civil rights organization, dismissed Rollins\u2019 message, saying the Trump administration has flip-flopped so much that her words shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put too much credence on this,\u201d Proa\u00f1o said. \u201cThe president understands he\u2019s getting significant pressure from the agriculture industry. These workers really are irreplaceable in our food distribution system.\u201d\nProa\u00f1o said the idea that \u201cbackbreaking work in some of the worst conditions\u201d could be replaced by automation or by people receiving Medicaid is simply not a realistic plan.\n\u201cThese are large conglomerates worth millions and millions of dollars,\u201d Proa\u00f1o said. \u201cIf they could have automated picking strawberries and oranges, they would have already.\u201d\nAutomation is not just around the corner, said Mark Bolda, a farm advisor specializing in berry agriculture on the Central Coast of California. Machines have a particularly hard time with strawberries because the soft fruit tends to be hidden under leaves.\n\u201cI think the secretary is being overly ambitious,\u201d he said.\nA transition to automation would require an expensive and unfeasible overhaul of the way strawberries are grown, Bolda said. It would require, for example, replacing sprawling strawberry fields with tabletop beds in controlled greenhouses with flat floors conducive to wheeled machines.\nFor now, the work of picking strawberries relies on humans.\n\u201cGrowers are very vigorously testing machines, but nothing\u2019s worked,\u201d he said.\nIn 2023, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19 to 64 who were covered by Medicaid were working, and more than a quarter were not working because of caregiving responsibilities, illness or disability, or because they were in school. That\u2019s according to the health policy organization KFF.\nManuel Cunha, head of the Nisei Farmers League, was skeptical of the idea that Medicaid recipients seeking employment would be a good fit for farm labor.\nIn the 1990s, he was part of an effort that included several California agricultural counties and state workforce leaders to make farm labor jobs available for people required to seek employment under the \u201cWelfare-to-Work\u201d program. He said farmers at the time were desperate for workers because many longtime farmworkers had recently become lawful permanent residents under President Reagan\u2019s amnesty program and sought jobs in different sectors.\nBut he said the effort was a disaster.\nAfter diligent outreach, only three people showed up to work, he said. One was late. A second person showed up and worked for part of the day before sustaining an injury and returning to the employment office to say he had gotten hurt on the job.\n\u201cWe lost crops,\u201d Cunha recalled. \u201cFruit literally rotted on the ground.\u201d\nAs confusion swirls around whether Trump will exempt farms and other businesses from immigration raids, businesses are emphasizing the importance of their immigrant workforce.\nDuring the news conference Tuesday, Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, mentioned her past as a farmer and rancher in South Dakota.\n\u201cI recognize that food policy is national security policy,\u201d she said. \u201cA country who cannot feed itself, cannot take care of itself and cannot provide for itself is not secure.\u201d\nCritics called her comments ironic, saying the Trump administration is taking farmworkers for granted and leaving the country vulnerable to food insecurity.\n\u201cThese deportations and this cruelty, it is affecting workers and their families and their community, but it\u2019s going to get to the point that we\u2019re all going to feel the pain,\u201d said United Farm Workers President Theresa Romero. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to find what we want and what we need, and whatever we find is going to be a lot more expensive.\u201d\nThe Trump Organization has filed to bring in at least 1,880 foreign workers under temporary visa programs since 2008 to staff Mar-a-Lago, four of its golf clubs and its Virginia winery, Forbes reported.\nIn an interview with Fox News last month, Trump said his administration is working to develop a \u201ctemporary pass\u201d for immigrants who work in agriculture.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do something for farmers, where we can let the farmer sort of be in charge,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe farmer knows. He\u2019s not going to hire a murderer. When you go into a farm and he\u2019s had somebody working with him for nine years doing this kind of work \u2014 which is hard work to do, and a lot of people aren\u2019t going to do it \u2014 and you end up destroying a farmer because you took all the people away, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d\nAsked about Rollins\u2019 comments later Tuesday, Trump reiterated that \u201cthere\u2019s no amnesty.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re getting rid of criminals, but we are doing a work program,\u201d he said.\nRollins pointed to the H-2A visa program and other seasonal worker programs, saying the conversations around temporary farm labor continue.\nLULAC, the civil rights group, launched a petition on Friday urging the Trump administration to legalize essential workers, including those in the agricultural and service industries. The petition collected 100,000 signatures in the first 24 hours after it went live, according to the organization.\nProa\u00f1o said he plans to visit Washington in the coming days to have \u201csome open dialogue\u201d with the administration. He said the president himself has voiced support for the legal pathway the petition calls for.\n\u201cWe are taking essentially the president\u2019s own words and his call to action and showing that there are a lot of people that support it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope he will find the wherewithal to do something about it.\u201d\nIndustry groups, including those advocating on behalf of agricultural businesses, have been lobbying Trump for a reprieve.\nRyan Jacobsen, chief executive of the Fresno County Farm Bureau and an almond and grape farmer, said he was caught off guard by Rollins\u2019 comments, saying they struck a different tone than Trump\u2019s previous remarks.\nJacobsen said that farmers in the Central Valley have, as the secretary suggested, embraced automation, but also know its limits.\n\u201cA fresh peach still requires a pair of hands to cut that off of a tree,\u201d he said. \u201cTable grapes still require the sensitive hands of an employee removing it from the vine.\u201d"
