  "description": "AriZona Chairperson and Co-founder Don Vultaggio said with rising tariffs, the brand may need to raise the price of its 99-cent, 22-ounce iced tea.",
  "content": "After more than 30 years, AriZona iced tea may see a price increase for the first time.\n\nAriZona Beverage Company is known for its 22-ounce cans of iced tea, including its wildly popular Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey served in the iconic teal can adorned with cherry blossoms. Since its founding in 1992, AriZona has sold these cans for 99 cents, but Chairperson and Co-founder Don Vultaggio told USA TODAY that if tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump continue to rise, the company may have to adjust its pricing.\n\nVultaggio said the situation is \"particularly unfair\" because 80% of the sheet metal used for AriZona products is recycled from the United States. The other 20% is imported. On June 3, Trump signed an executive order that issued a 50% tariff on all aluminum and steel imports.\n\n\"If pressures keep rising, we may have no choice but to adjust pricing, though we\u2019ll work hard to avoid it,\" Vultaggio said.\n\n\"Wherever we see savings \u2013 like lower crude oil costs for PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate, a plastic used for bottles) \u2013 we\u2019re passing them to customers with deeper promotions or outright price cuts, including plastic tall boys at $1,\" Vultaggio continued.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Increases Section 232 Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum\nCOUNTERING TRADE PRACTICES THAT UNDERMINE NATIONAL SECURITY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed a Proclamation to increase the tariff to 50% on steel and aluminum.\n- President Trump is taking action to protect America\u2019s critical steel and aluminum industries, which have been harmed by unfair trade practices and global excess capacity.\n- President Trump is raising the tariff on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, with the higher tariff set to go into effect on June 4, 2025.\n- Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the United Kingdom will remain at 25%, with possible changes or quotas starting July 9, 2025, depending on the status of the U.S.-UK Economic Prosperity Deal.\n- The steel and aluminum tariffs will apply only to the steel and aluminum contents of imported products, whereas the non-steel and non-aluminum contents of imported products will be subject to other applicable tariffs.\n- President Trump is cracking down on false import declarations by requiring strict reporting of steel and aluminum content, with tough penalties like fines or loss of import rights for violators.\n- President Trump is exercising his authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to adjust imports of steel and aluminum to protect our national security.\n- This statute provides the President with authority to adjust imports being brought into the United States in quantities or under circumstances that threaten to impair national security.\nRESTORING FAIRNESS TO STEEL AND ALUMINUM MARKETS: President Trump is taking action to end unfair trade practices and the global dumping of steel and aluminum.\n- Foreign nations have been flooding the United States market with cheap steel and aluminum, often subsidized by their governments.\n- A report from the first Trump Administration found that steel import levels and global excess were weakening our domestic economy and threatening to impair national security.\n- The report found that excess production and capacity has been a major factor in the decline of domestic aluminum production.\n- While the domestic steel industry briefly achieved 80% capacity utilization in 2021, subsequent trade pressure has depressed domestic production. In 2022 and 2023, capacity utilization fell to 77.3% and 75.3%, respectively. High import volumes from sources exempt from Section 232 tariffs were a major factor in depressing domestic production volumes.\n- For aluminum, there was an increase in the capacity utilization rate between 2017 and 2019, from 40% to 61% during that period. But since 2019, the aluminum capacity utilization has once again seen a steady decline, falling from 61% to 55% between 2019 and 2023.\n- The United States does not want to be in a position where it would be unable to meet demand for national defense and critical infrastructure in a national emergency.\nSTRENGTHENING AMERICA\u2019S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY: President Trump\u2019s decision to close existing loopholes and exemptions will strengthen United States\u2019 steel and aluminum industries.\n- In his first term, President Trump imposed Section 232 tariffs to protect the American steel and aluminum industries from unfair foreign competition.\n- The steel tariffs that President Trump implemented led to thousands of jobs gained and higher wages in the metals industry.\n- These tariffs were hailed as a \u201cboon\u201d for Minnesota\u2019s iron ore industry, with state officials crediting tariffs for bolstering the local economy.\n- Steel and aluminum imports drastically decreased under President Trump, falling by nearly a third from 2016 to 2020.\n- The tariffs led to a wave in investment across the United States, with more than $10 billion committed to build new mills.\n- Earlier this year, President Trump restored and strengthened Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, widely celebrated by the American steel and aluminum industries.\n- Now, President Trump is once again being praised by our steel and Aluminum industries for his decision to raise tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum even higher and protect American workers.\nTARIFFS WORK: Studies have repeatedly shown that contrary to public rhetoric, tariffs can be an effective tool for achieving economic and strategic objectives.\n- A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump\u2019s tariffs in his first Administration found that they \u201cstrengthened the U.S. economy,\u201d and \u201cled to significant reshoring\u201d in industries like manufacturing and steel production.\n- A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission that analyzed the effects of Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than $300 billion of U.S. imports found that the tariffs reduced imports from China, effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the tariffed goods, with very minor effects on prices.\n- According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first Administration \u201cclearly show[ed] no correlation with inflation\u201d and only had a temporary effect on overall price levels.\n- An analysis from the Atlantic Council found that \u201ctariffs would create new incentives for US consumers to buy US-made products.\u201d\n- Former Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed last year that tariffs do not raise prices: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they face.\u201d\n- A 2024 economic analysis found that a global tariff of 10% would grow the economy by $728 billion, create 2.8 million jobs, and increase real household incomes by 5.7%."

      "text": "Home Depot's famous giant Skelly is back with pet dog and cat: See 2025 Halloween line\nAugust is here and with it, the Halloween shopping season.\nAt least, that's according to Home Depot, which revealed its plans for this year's decor line of creatures, ghouls and monsters on July 28. While heat waves and trick-or-treating may not go hand-in-hand in the minds of many, retailers and enthusiasts alike have made \"Summerween\" something of an unofficial season, pushing product line releases and celebrations earlier and earlier each year.\nHome Depot's 2025 Halloween line, featuring familiar faces like the notorious giant Skelly and friends, dropped online and in-app on Monday, August 4, and will be in-store later this fall.\nReady to get your (horror) holiday shopping started? Check some of the highlights here.\nSkelly is back...\nHome Depot's unofficial superstar has entered the 21st century.\nSkelly, Home Depot's official name for the 12-foot skeleton figurine that first went viral in 2020, has gotten higher tech than ever in 2025. Those who love the classics can stick with the original, but forward-looking enthusiasts can now opt for Ultra Skelly.\nThough he's about half of the original Skelly's size at 6.5 feet tall, Ultra Skelly comes souped-up with Bluetooth capabilities that allow users to connect him to their smartphones and direct his movements, choose his light and LED eye displays and select from five pre-loaded phrases.\nPerhaps most impressively, users can interact with trick-or-treaters through Skelly by speaking directly into an app on their phone and hearing the words come out of his mouth in real-time. The app also features the option to pre-record 30 original phrases, which can be creepified with built-in voice filter features.\nThe original 12-foot Skelly retails for $299, while Ultra Skelly is priced at $279.\n...with another new pet: Skelly cat\nLast year, Skelly welcomed a new not-so-furry friend: a 7-foot-long bony canine aptly named \"Skelly's dog.\" The old dog has returned with a new trick, this time coming in its original form and shorter 5-foot sitting iteration.\nThis year, feline fans need not fret, as Skelly has welcomed a cat to join his posse, as well. The 5-foot pussycat comes poised to pounce in a crouching position with adjustable glowing eyes.\nYou can bring Skelly's Dog and Skelly's Cat home for $199, while Sitting Skelly's Dog with LCD eyes sells for $249.\nMore gruesome giants\nSkelly isn't the only larger-than-life figure skulking around this season.\nHome Depot's new \"Gruesome Grounds\" collection, inspired by an eerie forest feel, features two high-looming, 15-foot-tall characters.\nWorricrow, a twisted take on a pumpkin patch-guarding scarecrow, towers over even Skelly and boasts a wingspan of over 13 feet. The motion-activated straw man, adorned in a tattered jacket and hat, features a moving head and glowing eyes, mouth and chest.\nThe comparably tall Gally-Crow is Worricrow's counterpart, taking the \"crow\" part of its name literally with a bird-like appearance, ripped cloak and red-lit eye and chest.\nDespite their imposing size, both might cower in the face of the snarling 8-foot color-changing wyvern. The dragon-like creature comes equipped with three color choices, two booming roars and a head and neck that arche forward as it prepares to blow its fiery breath at unsuspecting visitors.\nWorricrow, Gally-Crow and the Color Changing Animated LED Wyvern are listed for $399.\nFamiliar faces\nLove - and terror - are in the air this spooky season.\nChucky, the original evil doll from 1988's \"Child's Play,\" appears for a second time in this year's collection as a 3.5-foot animated doll. Adorned with his classic overalls and wielding a knife, Chucky cycles through voice lines that were specifically written for the Home Depot decoration - as it turns out, the language in the original movie was a little too vulgar to play in stores.\nCreepier yet, Chucky's face not only features eyes that roll and move, but an uncanny smile that twists his realistic-looking face into a menacing grin.\nHe's accompanied by his bride, Tiffany Valentine, also measuring 3.5 feet tall and dressed in her unmistakable white wedding dress, black leather jacket and combat boots. Sporting a smile perhaps even more sinister than her beau's, she also swings a knife while repeating her own five phrases to passersby.\nFrankenstein's Monster returns as well, still standing at an impressive 7 feet, but this time with his own bride in tow.\nThe new 6-foot Bride of Frankenstein is, like her beloved, crafted with lifelike skin and bulbous, wandering eyes. Dressed in her wedding best, she moves at the waist, arms and face and speaks four classic phrases.\nClassic Chucky and Scarred Chucky, equipped with a light-up bloodied knife and torn facial skin, both sell for $229, as does Tiffany Valentine. Frankenstein's Monster and Bride of Frankenstein are priced at $279.\nView the entire collection at Home Depot"

      "text": "At Home canceling some store closures, despite bankruptcy: See where\nAt Home filed for bankruptcy last month and said that it would close 26 \"underperforming\" stores by the fall. Now, the retail chain announced that two of those stores will stay open.\nThe furniture and home decor retailer based in Coppell, Texas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday, June 16, as a result of \"broader economic and retail-specific market pressures,\" court documents showed. The bankruptcy filing and store closures follow several other \"big box\" retailers that have followed suit this year, including Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl's, JCPenney, Macy's, and Party City.\nThe company employed about 7,170 employees when it filed for bankruptcy protection.\nHere's what to know about the cancellation of two store closures:\nWhich At Home locations are staying open?\nThe following stores in New Jersey and Wisconsin will remain open:\n- 3201 N. Mayfair Road in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin\n- 301 Nassau Park Boulevard in Princeton, New Jersey\nWhich At Home stores are closing?\nThe following stores will close by Sept. 30 of this year:\n- 6135 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park, New York\n- 300 Baychester Ave. in Bronx, New York\n- 750 Newhall Drive in San Jose, California\n- 2505 El Camino Real in Tustin, California\n- 14585 Biscayne Boulevard in North Miami, Florida\n- 2200 Harbor Boulevard in Costa Mesa, California\n- 3795 E.

Cicero Ave. in Crestwood, Illinois\nWhy did At Home file for bankruptcy?\nCourt documents said that rising interest rates, \"persistent inflation,\" and a growing concern over unsustainable customs costs resulting from increased tariffs led At Home to file for bankruptcy. As a result, At Home has already closed six stores over the past year.\n\"Given the expenses associated with brick-and-mortar operation and the issues affecting the retail industry, a number of the (At Home) remaining stores are operating at sub-optimal performance levels,\" court documents revealed.\nAs part of the bankruptcy filing, ownership of At Home will be transferred to a group of hedge funds and investment firms based in New York City and San Francisco, as outlined in a news release."

      "text": "Donald Trump pushes forward on tariffs despite court challenges: What to know\nPresident Donald Trump is hiking tariffs on aluminum and steel as his administration presses countries to speed up trade talks, amid legal battles.\nWASHINGTON \u2014President Donald Trump's trade agenda is about to enter a new phase, as the Republican moves forward \u2212 for now \u2212 with tariff hikes.\nIn the face of mockery for repeatedly backing down from previous big tariff announcements, Trump is increasing tariffs on aluminum and steel imports to 50%. And his administration told nations in a letter this week that they have until June 4 to provide an update on the status of individual negotiations.\nThe tariffs are expected to be a major topic of discussion during Trump's meeting on June 5 with Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and in an as-of-yet unscheduled phone call that the White House says the United States president will be holding this week with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.\nAt the same time, court challenges threaten to keep his administration from enforcing county-specific tariffs.\nThe legal challenges to Trump's tariffs in court have only been a minor setback, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a June 1 appearance on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\"Rest assured, tariffs are not going away,\" Lutnick said, adding that even if higher courts upheld rulings that the law Trump cited to impose tariffs didn't grant him that power, the administration would find another legal power to use.\nCountries quickly came back to the table to negotiate deals after an appeals court allowed Trump's tariffs to remain in place while the administration makes its case.\nTrump increases tariffs on aluminum and steel\nTrump has already started to pull some of those levers, announcing plans last Friday to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump said a previously imposed tariff of 25% would increase to 50% on June 4. He signed an order formalizing the hike on June 3.\nThe tariffs were expected to affect Canada, which is the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, and Mexico among other nations. The European Union promptly warned that it could expand a list of countermeasures it is preparing to go into effect in mid-July if a trade agreement with the United States is not reached.\nCanadian ambassador to the United States Kirsten Hillman told USA TODAY in an interview that the increase was \"unideal\" but Canada's steel and aluminum exports have other markets that producers have already started to pivot to where they remain in demand.\nThe higher tariffs will be \"very negative for the U.S. economy\" and for trade between the two countries, Hillman said. She predicted that the hike would lead to \"a wall\" being erected between the countries for the two metals, prompting shortages and increased costs for Americans.\n\"Those are really costs that are going to be borne by Americans through price increases in everything from cars to home goods, anything that's manufactured with those two metals, which is an awful lot of what we use in our everyday lives,\" Hillman said.\nWhite House downplays trade letter to countries\nIn a separate escalation against America's trading partners, the office of the United States Trade Representative pressed countries to respond by June 4 with their best offers to avoid higher country-specific tariffs.\nTrump had previously told countries they had until July 8 to cut deals with the United States as part of a 90-day pause on so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs he imposed and then halted earlier this year.\nA universal tariff of 10% that Trump put on most nations at the same time remains in place, as do the tariffs he put on Mexico, Canada and China that were tied to his efforts to combat illegal immigration to the United States and the flow of fentanyl.\nAfter a draft of the letter leaked to Reuters, two senior administration officials told USA TODAY that it was not a final notice.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also sought to downplay the significance of the correspondence at a June 3 press briefing, where she told reporters, \"This letter was simply to remind these countries that the deadline is approaching, and the president expects good deals, and we are on track for that.\"\nCanada, China, EU in the crosshairs\nIt was not immediately clear which nations received the letter. Hillman told USA TODAY that Canada, whose minister for trade with the United States Dominic LeBlanc is currently in Washington for talks, was not among them.\nThe meeting is a continuation of the conversation that took place between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the ambassador said, and was not expected to immediately produce a major announcement.\nTrump currently has a higher tariff of 25% on products not covered by a trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on potash (a kind of fertilizer) and Canadian energy products that are not exempted under the agreement.\nThe administration has said it is talking about deals with more than a dozen countries but none have emerged so far outside of a framework agreement with the UK.\nThe president last month threatened, and then backed off, a threat to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, as trade talks with the bloc continue. The EU declined on June 2 to comment on the reported USTR letter.\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is currently in Paris negotiating with trading partners, the White House said on June 3. Trump will also speak to Merz of Germany on June 5 when the leader visits White House for the first time since his May election.\nLeavitt told reporters that Trump has been \"very direct\" in his talks with foreign leaders and had told them \"they need to cut deals\" with his administration. \"He's unafraid to use tariffs to protect our industries and protect our workers, but he wants to see these tailor-made deals be signed,\" Leavitt added.\nTrump is also expecting to speak with Xi of China this week, the White House has said. The president last week accused China of violating an agreement between the two nations to deescalate their trade war. China fired back that it was the United States undermining the deal that saw the U.S. reduce a 145% tariff to 30% while negotiations take place.\nLeavitt affirmed to reporters on June 3 that call between the leaders was likely to take place this week but declined to provide additional details during her briefing.\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment on the possibility of a call, the status of negotiations and whether Beijing had received the letter from the United States' trade representative.\nTrump tariffs hit legal snags\nThe tariffs have faced numerous legal challenges since Trump began rolling them out shortly after taking office.\nMost recently, the U.S. Court of International Trade paused tariffs that Trump imposed without congressional approval only to have the ruling temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court.\nA U.S. district court also blocked Trump tariffs from hitting two toy manufacturers at the end of May. The Trump administration appealed that decision on June 2.\nIn another case, a judge on June 2 dismissed a challenge from the state California, saying the filing belongs in the international trade court that is based in New York. The decision will allow California to bring its case to another appeals court.\nIn a series of TV appearances on June 1, administration officials said they were confident courts would ultimately side with Trump.\nBut if a judge rules against the administration, there are \"other alternatives that we can pursue as well,\" the president's National Economic Council director, Kevin Hassett, said in an interview on ABC News' \"This Week.\"\nHe offered provisions of U.S. trade law that give the executive branch the power impose tariffs on imports Trump deems a national security threat or in response to unreasonable or discriminatory trade imbalances as potential options.\n\"This is something we've been studying from 2017 on,\" he said. \"We picked the best way. It's going to be upheld in court.\""
