  "content": "Shohei Ohtani had a little fun with a heckler during Sunday\u2019s 8-2 win over the Padres.\n\nA fan sitting near the Dodgers\u2019 dugout had been giving the star a hard time during the course of the game at Petco Park.\n\nSo when Ohtani hit a ninth-inning solo home run to extend Los Angeles\u2019 lead to six, he made sure to let the fan have it right back.\n\nBefore Ohtani went to high-five his teammates, he walked over to where the fan was sitting and high-fived him \u2014 sending the Padres fan shrinking into his seat \u2014 and patted the fan on the back.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fan sitting right by the Dodger dugout that\u2019s been giving Ohtani heck all day,\u201d Dodgers play-by-play broadcaster Joe Davis said. \u201cAfter he homers, he says, \u2018How you like that?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it made his day,\u201d Davis continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a story he\u2019ll always be able to tell.\u201d\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts and several of his teammates loved the move by Ohtani to give the fan a bit of a hard time back, with Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez tossing sunflower seeds at Ohtani and Roberts high-fiving him as he walked down the steps.\n\n\u201cIt was very out of character from Shohei, [but the heckler] was wearing him out the whole game,\u201d Roberts said, per the Associated Press. \u201cSo it was good to see Shohei initiate a high-five from him. That was great. That was fun. It was good to see Shohei show his personality.\u201d\n\nThe home run was part of a big win for the Dodgers, who avoided the sweep after dropping games on Friday and Saturday at Petco Park.\n\nOhtani\u2019s home run was his 45th of the season and moved him into a tie with Philadelphia\u2019s Kyle Schwarber for second-most home runs in the National League this season.\n\nPrior to the home run on Sunday, Ohtani had been 0-for-10 with two walks in the series.",

The fan was sitting near the Dodgers' dugout and had been heckling throughout the game. Ohtoni high-fived the fan and patted him on the back. This move was praised by Dodgers play-by-play broadcaster Joe Davis and manager Dave Roberts. The home run, which was his 45th of the season, moved him into second-place with Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber.",

      "text": "Shohei Ohtani high-fives a heckler after his homer to cap Dodgers\u2019 comeback rivalry win over Padres\nShohei Ohtani high-fives a heckler after his homer to cap Dodgers\u2019 comeback rivalry win over Padres\nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 A heckler next to the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 dugout spent his entire Sunday giving an earful to the visitors, including a nonstop barrage of digs and chirps at Shohei Ohtani for his hitless performance in a portentous weekend series against the San Diego Padres.\nWhen Ohtani crushed his 45th homer and delivered the knockout blow in the ninth inning of the Dodgers\u2019 8-2 victory, the normally decorous three-time MVP detoured on his way back to the dugout to slap hands \u2014 and get the last word \u2014 with the chagrined Padres fan.\nThe Dodgers loved to see it, along with just about everything else that transpired in the final four innings of a win that evened the NL West race yet again with 31 games left.\n\u201cIt was very out of character from Shohei, (but the heckler) was wearing him out the whole game,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cSo it was good to see Shohei initiate a high-five from him. That was great. That was fun. It was good to see Shohei show his personality.\u201d\nOhtani didn\u2019t speak to reporters afterward, but he didn\u2019t need a loudmouth fan to tell him that he was 0 for 10 with two walks in the series before his 409-foot homer off Yuki Matsui.\nHis fellow Dodgers had already delivered by then, with rookie Dalton Rushing\u2019s tiebreaking three-run shot in the seventh inning sandwiched between clutch homers in back-to-back innings by Freddie Freeman.\n\u201cI think he was just kind of talking to Shohei the whole game, so I\u2019m glad Shohei was able to give him a little something else to cheer about,\u201d Freeman said with a grin.\nFreeman and the rest of the Dodgers heard plenty of yapping from the stands during the weekend in the latest chapter of what might currently be the liveliest rivalry in the sport. The noise intensified as Los Angeles lost the first two games while managing just five combined hits \u2014 but the defending champs still managed to head home smiling and even with the Padres at 74-57.\nWhen asked if the rivalry is the best in baseball, Rushing replied: \u201cI think so. I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say. You see the atmosphere we play in, whether it\u2019s here or in LA. I think it\u2019s pretty special. There\u2019s something to it. There\u2019s a lot of superstars on the field, and it\u2019s fun to play in these games.\u201d\nBoth teams could find reasons to be optimistic after wrapping up the regular season matchups between two World Series contenders that have also met in three of the past five postseasons, with the Dodgers winning two of those matchups.\nThe Dodgers have already won the season series with San Diego 9-4, giving them the tiebreaker if the clubs are still even 31 games from now.\nSan Diego still took two of three on the weekend with phenomenal starting pitching from a club that already has a bullpen that could be the best in the majors \u2014 its poor performance Sunday notwithstanding, of course.\nJeremiah Estrada gave up a homer in his second consecutive game when Rushing connected, while Wandy Peralta and Matsui also surrendered late homers.\nBut Yu Darvish, Nestor Cortes and Nick Pivetta combined to allow just four hits and three runs by the Dodgers over 18 innings. In a short October series, the Padres are confident they\u2019ve got the arms to match Ohtani, Freeman and the Dodgers\u2019 powerful lineup.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more thrilled,\u201d San Diego manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing outstanding baseball, so I don\u2019t tend to get too caught up in today. Today we were disappointed. Didn\u2019t happen for us. We couldn\u2019t be more thrilled. We\u2019re tied for our division lead and expect to go win it.\u201d\nThe division race means something to both teams \u2014 and not just because they\u2019d both prefer not to play a perilous wild card playoff series in early October.\nThe Dodgers have won 11 of the last 12 NL West titles, while the Padres haven\u2019t won the division since 2006. San Diego is closing in on its fourth playoff berth in six seasons during the longest run of sustained success in team history.\nWhile the rivals won\u2019t meet again in the regular season, both teams acknowledge they\u2019ll be watching what the other does down the stretch.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to treat the next however many games until the regular season is over like we\u2019re neck-and-neck with them,\u201d Rushing said. \u201cWhether we\u2019re tied in the division or we\u2019re eight games out, we\u2019re going to treat it like it\u2019s the same, and I think it\u2019s a good thing. You hold a competitive edge finishing out the regular season, and that\u2019s what you kind of carry into the postseason.\u201d\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB"

I thought it was a part of the show. It was bad judgment, and a work that went wrong. Raja is a MMA fighter not a pro wrestler and had no business involved in an event like this,\u201d Rampage Jackson wrote on X.\n\u201cI don\u2019t condone my son\u2019s actions AT ALL! He suffered a concussion from sparring only days ago and had no business doing anything remotely close to physical contact. As a father, im deeply concerned with his health AND the well being of Mr. Smith. That being said I\u2019m very upset that any of this happened, but my main concern now is that Mr. Smith will make a speedy recovery.I apologize on his behalf and to KICK for the situation.\u201d\nKnokX Pro called Jackson\u2019s actions \u201creprehensible\u201d and said it was a \u201cselfish, irresponsible act of violence.\u201d\n\u201cIn the 17 years of operation of KnokX Pro Wrestling Academy, there has never been anything as heinous take place such as this and we apologize to our patrons and fans,\u201d the statement read."
