  "description": "The company's Alani Nu acquisition is paying off.",
  "content": "The company's Alani Nu acquisition is paying off.\n\nIn May, I predicted that a turnaround could be near for Celsius (CELH 3.93%), and the company delivered when it recently reported its second-quarter results. The stock shot higher and has now nearly doubled on the year, as of this writing.\n\nThe question now, though, is: Can the stock keep its momentum going, or is it too late to buy the stock? Let's take a closer look at the company's recent results and prospects to find out.\n\nThe biggest reason why I thought a Celsius turnaround was around the corner was due to its acquisition of rival energy drink maker Alani Nu.\n\nAlani Nu had been growing quickly, and that continued in Q2, with the brand's retail sales soaring 129%. Its market share, meanwhile, nearly doubled year over year to 6.3% for the 13 weeks ended June 29, a 3.1-point year-over-year gain. The company credited the strong growth to popular limited-time offerings (LTOs), including Sherbet Swirl and Cotton Candy flavors.\n\nThe Celsius brand was also solid, with revenue growing 9% to $438.1 million and unit sales up 6%. Retail sales increased 3% year over year, but were up 17.6% sequentially. It held an 11% dollar share in the energy drink category, down 130 basis points year over year. For its part, the Celsius brand will launch its first LTO flavors this fall.\n\nOverall company sales climbed 84% to $739.3 million, soaring past analyst expectations for revenue of $655.7 million. Meanwhile, retail sales grew 29% and volume increased 31%.\n\nNorth America sales jumped 87% to $714.5 million, due largely to the addition of Alani Nu. International sales, meanwhile, climbed 27% to $24.8 million, with Celsius seeing strong growth in Australia, the U.K., and France. The company said it is seeing the same fitness trends in international markets as it is in North America, with more females beginning to consume energy drinks.\n\nProfitability was also strong, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soaring 68% to $0.47, well ahead of the $0.21 analyst consensus. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), meanwhile, surged 109% to $220.3 million.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects some margin pressure in the latter half of 2025 due to higher input costs, largely stemming from aluminum tariffs. It will also increase its marketing efforts to help increase brand awareness. This will include its \"Lift.Fit.Go\" campaign, and having its first national TV commercial during NFL games this fall.\n\nIs the stock still a buy?\n\nAlani Nu was the big driver of the quarter, and I would expect that to be the case at least in the near to medium term. The brand's strong results came without it being integrated into Celsius' distribution network. While it currently plans to run two distribution networks, I would eventually expect the company to shift Alani Nu over to PepsiCo's network. That should expand its retail presence, particularly in the important convenience store channel.\n\nThe Celsius brand saw a nice improvement in the quarter, as the brand tries to regain its traction. Meanwhile, the introduction of LTOs for the first time this fall, along with increased advertising, should help drive growth. International expansion also remains a nice opportunity.\n\nLooking at valuation, the stock now trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of around 42.5 times 2026 analyst estimates. Following its surge in price, the stock is no longer trading at the attractive valuation it was earlier this year.\n\nWhile I still believe the company has a good opportunity in front of it with Alani Nu, I think the valuation is a bit ahead of itself. As such, I would not chase the stock at current levels, and would prefer it on a pullback.",

      "text": "The acronym EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA is a useful metric for understanding a business's ability to generate cash flow for its owners and for judging a company's operating performance.\nWhy it matters\nWhy EBITDA matters\nEBITDA is an earnings metric that is capital-structure neutral, meaning it doesn't account for the different ways a company may use debt, equity, cash, or other capital sources to finance its operations. It also excludes non-cash expenses like depreciation, which may or may not reflect a company's ability to generate cash that it can pay back as dividends.\nAdditionally, it excludes taxes, which can vary from one period to the next and are affected by numerous conditions that may not be directly related to a company's operating results.\nAmortization\nOverall, EBITDA is a handy tool for normalizing a company's results so you can more easily evaluate the business. To be clear, EBITDA is not a substitute for other metrics such as net income. After all, the items excluded from EBITDA -- interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses -- are still real items with financial implications that should not be dismissed or ignored.\nEBITDA is often most useful for comparing two similar businesses or trying to determine a company's cash flow potential.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate EBITDA\nEBITDA is very simple to calculate. Start with a company's annual SEC Form 10-K or quarterly 10-Q report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Go to the operating statement, and you will find line items for all of the items in EBITDA:\n- Earnings (net income or net loss)\n- Interest expense (sometimes also interest income)\n- Income tax expense (sometimes also tax credit)\n- Depreciation and amortization (typically combined but sometimes as separate line items)\nNext, add up all the line items that are expenses, subtract any line items that are income (such as interest income), then add the total to the net income (or net loss) figure. The result is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. In other words, you're adding any expenses from these categories to (and subtracting any gains from) the company's net income.\nNote: Many companies also report adjusted EBITDA. This is not the same thing as EBITDA since it includes additional expenses such as stock issuance, nonrecurring expenses, and other material items that affect the results. While adjusted EBITDA can be useful, it can also be used by company management to support a narrative that frames the company in the best light while disregarding items investors should factor into their analysis and not ignore.\nLimitations of EBITDA\nThe limitations of EBITDA\nEBITDA can be a useful tool for better understanding a company's underlying operating results, comparing it to similar businesses, and understanding the impact of the company's capital structure on its bottom line and cash flows.\nHowever, using EBITDA incorrectly can have a negative impact on your returns. EBITDA should not be used exclusively as a measure of a company's financial performance, nor should it be a reason to disregard the impact of a company's capital structure on its financial performance.\nEBITDA should be considered one tool among many in your financial analysis tool belt. The example below helps explain why relying solely on EBITDA can be a mistake.\nWhy EBITDA: An example\nWhy EBITDA: An example\nSuppose you wanted to evaluate two businesses. To keep this example easy to follow, we will compare two lemonade stands with similar revenues, equipment and property investments, taxes, and costs of production. But they'll have big differences in how much net income they generate due to differences in their capital structures.\nLemonade Stand A was funded entirely by equity. Lemonade Stand B primarily uses debt to fund its operations. The only difference between them is how they choose to finance these assets -- one with debt, one with equity.\nIncome statements for these two lemonade stands appear below.\n| Lemonade Stand A | |\n|---|---|\n| Revenue | $1,000 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $200 |\n| Interest Expense | $0 |\n| Depreciation of Lemonade Stand | $50 |\n| Income Before Taxes | $750 |\n| Net Income (35% tax rate) | $487.50 |\n| EBITDA | $800 |\nNote that Lemonade Stand A earned $487.50 in net income, while EBITDA was $800 in the example year.\n| Lemonade Stand B | |\n|---|---|\n| Revenue | $1,000 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $200 |\n| Interest Expense ($1,500 at 10% interest) | $150 |\n| Depreciation of Lemonade Stand | $50 |\n| Income Before Taxes | $600 |\n| Net Income (35% tax rate) | $390 |\n| EBITDA | $800 |\nBecause Lemonade Stand B uses substantially more debt ($1,500 at 10% interest) to finance its operations, it is less profitable in terms of net income ($390 in profits versus $487.50). However, when compared on the basis of EBITDA, the lemonade stands are equal, each producing $800 in EBITDA from $1,000 in sales last year.\nWhat's the lesson here? By looking at EBITDA, we can determine the underlying profitability of a company's operations, allowing for easier comparison to another business. Then we can take those results and gain a deeper understanding of the impact of a company's capital structure, e.g., debt and capital expenditures, as well as differences in taxes (particularly if the companies operate in different places) on the company's actual profits and cash flows.\nRelated investing topics\nDoing all that can go a long way toward helping you decide if a company is worth investing in and what price it's worth. In the example above, Lemonade Stand A would be worth more to investors since it is able to turn more of its EBITDA into net income. Lemonade Stand B isn't as profitable because of its debt expense, so investors should be compensated by paying a lower stock price."

      "text": "Revenue is many things. Commonly known as sales, it\u2019s the top line of the income statement as well as a key financial metric that investors use to measure the financial health of a business. Like any financial metric, there are also rules underpinning the way it\u2019s measured and recorded, and investors should be familiar with these revenue recognition principles.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is revenue?\nPut simply, revenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered. In some businesses, revenue is referred to as sales, though it can also come in the form of commissions, premiums, subscriptions, and credit card fees, as well as other channels, depending on the type of business in question.\nRevenue is often used as one way of measuring the size of a business, and investors tend to look at revenue growth as a reflection of a business\u2019s growth rate. Along with profits, or net income, revenue is generally one of the two most important metrics that investors look at in the income statement.\nUnderstanding revenue\nUnderstanding revenue\nRevenue might seem like a simple concept, but the way it\u2019s recorded isn\u2019t always straightforward, and how it\u2019s recorded often depends on the type of business.\nFor some businesses, like retail, revenue is typically recorded when a sale is made, but for other businesses, like software, it\u2019s more complicated. In accrual accounting, the basis for an income statement, revenue is recorded when a service is provided, not when it\u2019s paid for. So the timing of revenue recognition can differ significantly from the timing of cash collection, depending on the type of business and how customers pay their bills. In contract-based businesses like software, customers may pay up front for some products or pay after the services have been provided.\nAccrual accounting is designed to smooth out the lumps that are common in cash-based accounting, making revenue a useful indicator of how a business is performing. However, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on cash flow to make sure that revenue is being converted into cash.\nCash Flow\nHow to use it\nHow to use revenue\nRevenue is a valuable tool for investors, and there are a number of ways it plays into financial analysis. One common usage is in the price-to-sales ratio, which values a stock based on how the share price compares to revenue per share.\nFor profitable companies, investors typically prefer to use the price-to-earnings ratio, but the price-to-sales ratio can help complete the valuation picture since profit margins can vary from quarter to quarter, and profit growth relies on revenue growth. For companies in sectors like software that may not have profits, the price-to-sales ratio is especially valuable since it shows how expensive the stocks are and how they compare to others.\nRevenue growth is also a key metric for investors. In general, revenue growth is the best metric to use to assess a company\u2019s growth rate and potential. Although revenue has to ultimately translate into profits, a stock\u2019s value is closely tied to its top-line growth rate since that offers an indication of the demand for a company\u2019s products and its potential for expansion.\nHow it's calculated\nHow revenue is calculated\nAt its most basic level, revenue is calculated as price multiplied by the quantity sold. If a restaurant sold 20 hamburgers for $10, its revenue would be $200.\nFor most companies, which have multiple product lines and different businesses, calculating revenue is more complex, and the underlying concept is straightforward. Revenue is money that comes in from normal business operations. That\u2019s separate from one-time gains like stock sales, legal proceeds, or interest income for non-financial companies.\nUnderstanding revenue is a valuable tool for any investor, especially as we look forward to the next bull market. Knowing the different ways that businesses recognize revenue is helpful for analyzing individual sectors. Comparing the cash flow statement with revenue is also important to make sure businesses are converting their revenue into cash.\nFinally, looking at metrics like the price-to-sales ratio and revenue growth can help guide your investments; both of those key metrics start with revenue."

      "text": "What is it?\nWhat is Earnings Per Share (EPS)?\nEarnings per share (EPS) is a metric investors commonly use to value a stock or company because it indicates the profitability of a company on a per-share basis. EPS is calculated by subtracting any preferred dividends from a company's net income and dividing that amount by the number of shares outstanding. Net income is the amount of money that remains in a reporting period after all cash and non-cash expenses are deducted, and net income minus preferred dividends is synonymous with a company's profit for the period. Preferred dividends must be subtracted because holders of preferred stock have contractual rights to dividend payouts. Read on to find out more about earnings per share -- calculating them, understanding how to use them, and the difference between different ways to look at this important metric.\nA company reports its EPS in consolidated statements of operations (income statements) in both annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) SEC filings. Considering a company's earnings as its profit, the company can either distribute that money to shareholders or reinvest it in the company.\nIt's useful to know how to calculate EPS yourself for a few different reasons.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate earnings per share (EPS)\nLet's walk through an example EPS calculation using Netflix (NFLX 0.57%). For its most recent fiscal year, the company reported a net income of $4,491,924,000 and total shares outstanding of 444,698,000. The company's balance sheet indicates Netflix has not issued any preferred stock, so we don't need to subtract preferred dividends. Dividing $4,491,924,000 into 444,698,000 produces an EPS value of $10.10.\nNet Income\nLimitations\nLimitations of EPS\nThe main limitation of using EPS to value a stock or company is that EPS is calculated using net income. Non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization are subtracted from net income, and the lumpy nature of capital expenditures can cause a company's net income to vary greatly across reporting periods. Businesses can have many different non-operating expenses, such as tax and interest payments, which affect net income. A company's net income doesn't accurately reflect its cash flow or the health of its business.\nAdditionally, companies can and do manipulate their EPS numbers by changing the number of shares outstanding. Share issuances, splits, and stock buybacks all change the denominator by which net income less preferred dividends is divided.\nEPS numbers are most useful when evaluated along with other metrics. The two most common are the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company's stock price to its EPS, and the return on equity (ROE), which indicates the amount of profit a company generates from its net assets.\nDividends Per Share\nBasic vs. diluted EPS\nBasic EPS vs. diluted EPS\nDiluted EPS numbers, unlike the \"basic\" EPS metric described above, account for all potential shares outstanding. Financial instruments like convertible debt and employee stock options, which are often used to raise capital and motivate employees, must be added to the outstanding share count to calculate a company's diluted EPS.\nLet's calculate the diluted EPS for Netflix. The company has granted 6,592,000 stock options to employees, which raises the total outstanding share count to 451,290,000. Dividing the same $4,491,924,000 of net income into 451,290,000 equals an EPS value of $9.95.\nValuation models use fully diluted EPS because it is more conservative. Share counts tend to increase, especially for fast-growing companies that leverage their abilities to issue more shares in order to expand.\nDifferences\nWhat is the difference between EPS and adjusted EPS?\nCompanies often report EPS values using net income numbers that are adjusted for one-time profits and expenses, like sales of business units or losses from natural disasters. Although a company's adjusted EPS can be a more accurate indicator of the company's performance, some companies aggressively \"adjust\" their net incomes in misleading or even fraudulent ways to boost their adjusted EPS numbers.\nRelated investing topics\nWhat is a good EPS?\nWhat is a good EPS?\nA good EPS is determined less by the absolute value of the EPS and more by its year-over-year change. The absolute value of a company's EPS should increase annually, but the rate of increase of EPS should also accelerate.\nA company's EPS can vary based on fluctuations in earnings, total number of shares outstanding, or both. A company can boost its EPS by increasing its earnings or reducing its share count through share buybacks, but a company that increases its outstanding share count faster than its earnings will cause its EPS to drop.\nStock investors can further evaluate a company's EPS by considering it in conjunction with its P/E ratio and determining how the company's share price is fluctuating relative to its earnings."

      "url": "https://www.fool.com/terms/v/valuation/",
      "text": "Valuation is the process of figuring out what something is worth. Spoiler alert: Stocks and other assets usually don't cost (the price) what they're truly worth (the value) -- they can be either overpriced or underpriced. Investors can achieve better long-term returns by consistently identifying investments that are mispriced and using this knowledge to their advantage.\nOverview\nWhat valuation is\nA company that goes public sells shares to investors, with each representing a small percentage ownership stake in the business. Valuation seeks to determine what those businesses are worth now or what those businesses could be worth at some future date. The process is both a science and an art. It's a science because it's a fundamental analysis that uses numbers and formulas. But it's also an art because investors need to use estimates and make some assumptions as well, injecting a measure of uncertainty. The more uncertainty there is to the valuation process, the harder it is to confidently assign a higher value.\nThere are two major camps when it comes to valuation: intrinsic value and relative value. On one hand, the intrinsic valuation process attempts to predict all of the future cash flows for the life of the asset to determine the present value of the asset. This can be especially helpful when investing in something with a known return (such as a bond) or when buying a business outright. On the other hand, the relative valuation process is especially helpful for stocks since they frequently change hands and usually represent businesses with unknown lifespans. This relative valuation approach applies a premium to the fundamental numbers (20 times a company's profit, for example) based on what the market will support.\nHow it works\nHow valuation works\nInvesting great Warren Buffett prefers the intrinsic valuation method because he acquires businesses outright when the price is attractive. And he once gave a great example at a meeting for shareholders of his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.15%)(BRK.B -0.11%). In the 1970's, he bought See's Candies for $25 million. But it's earned around $2 billion cumulatively in his 50 years of owning it. From this, we see that Buffett clearly bought See's Candies for far below its intrinsic value -- he got far more out of it than what he put into it. And this ultimately means that he made a small fortune from this one investment.\nMost investors aren't buying entire businesses, but many still use the principles of intrinsic value when investing in stocks. However, investors more commonly use relative valuation methods. For example, let's say that you can predict with a high degree of certainty that a shoe company will have earnings per share of $10 within the next five years. Shoe stocks commonly trade at 10 times earnings, if not more. Using a relative valuation method, investors could comfortably predict that this particular shoe stock will be worth $100 per share within the next five years. If that stock trades at, say, $25 per share today, you may have just stumbled upon an undervalued investment opportunity that could help you make your own small fortune.\nMethods\nValuation methods\nIn the above example, investors would use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value my imaginary shoe business. But there are situations when things aren't so simple, and different valuation tools are helpful. For example, companies without earnings can't be valued with a P/E ratio because earnings are literally part of the equation. But this doesn't necessarily mean that those businesses are worthless, so they instead might be valued with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. Additionally, accounting practices can distort profits, which is why many investors like to value a company with the price-to-free cash flow ratio. In short, there are many popular valuation metrics, and each has merits.\nHowever, investors should remember that many metrics share a key shortcoming. Renowned value investor Bill Miller puts it this way, \"One hundred percent of the information you have about a company represents the past, and 100% of the value depends on the future.\" In other words, investors can't solely rely on the known numbers, but rather, they also need to have an opinion about what will happen with the business, the industry, and the economy.\nThis is why having an investment thesis is crucial when investing in a stock. A thesis will address things such as whether a market opportunity will get bigger or smaller, whether business growth will accelerate or decelerate, and whether profit margins will strengthen or deteriorate. By getting a handle on such things, investors can have an idea of the future financial state of the business. From there, they can use a valuation metric, or a combination of metrics, to determine the valuation of the company. This valuation assumption will help them decide whether it's mispriced in their favor today.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nA valuation example\nIn early 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) is a big investing topic and Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%) is a top player in the space. Market analysts have predicted a large market opportunity in AI long before it dominated the headlines. For his part, Nvidia's founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, delivered the first AI supercomputer in 2016. At the time, Nvidia stock was trading at a P/S ratio of about 6.\nLet's say that you were aware of the predictions for the AI space and were familiar with Nvidia's AI-focused products. Perhaps you didn't know exactly how high the company's revenue would soar, but you believed it would go up significantly over the coming decade. Well, even though a P/S ratio of 6 isn't exactly cheap, you still may have concluded that Nvidia stock was undervalued in 2016 because you had a high degree of certainty that it would be an AI leader, and revenue would consequently skyrocket. This is exactly what happened -- Nvidia stock is one of the greatest performers over the last decade, in large part because its revenue is almost 20 times larger today than it was in 2016 when the first AI supercomputer was delivered."

      "text": "Forward P/E is a valuation metric that uses earnings forecasts to calculate the ratio of the share price to projected earnings per share. The \"P\" in forward P/E stands for price, or share price. The \"E\" stands for future earnings per share.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is forward P/E?\nForward P/E is a variation of the price-to-earnings ratio that uses an estimate of earnings over the next 12 months to calculate the metric. Unlike the trailing P/E, which uses actual earnings results from the previous 12 months, the forward P/E is based on estimates, and is therefore subject to errors in forecasting.\nTo combat the potential to get the estimated earnings wrong, the forward P/E is typically calculated using a consensus estimate from all analysts who have published their expectations. This wisdom of the crowd approach typically leads to more accurate estimates.\nHow to calculate it\nHow to calculate forward P/E\nThe formula for calculating a forward P/E ratio is very straightforward.\nForward P/E = Current share price / Estimated future earnings per share\nThe hard part is determining the estimated earnings per share. Several resources provide consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts for big companies. Some companies, however, only have a few analysts (and sometimes none) publishing estimates. In those cases it may be worthwhile to dig into the company financials, management\u2019s commentary, and build your own estimate to aggregate with the professionals.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say a stock currently trades for around $150 per share. Analysts expect it\u2019ll produce earnings per share of $6 over the next year. That stock has a forward P/E ratio of 25.\nHow to use it\nHow to use forward P/E\nCalculating the forward P/E of a stock isn\u2019t very useful in and of itself. To get something out of it, you need to calculate the forward P/E of other comparable stocks.\nComparing the forward P/E of two or more companies within the same industry can give you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If one stock has a P/E far greater than its peers, the stock might not be a very good deal.\nBut there are good reasons why a stock may have a high forward P/E. If analysts expect that company\u2019s earnings per share to grow significantly faster than its peers, it\u2019ll value the next 12 months of earnings far higher than a slow-growing company. That\u2019s because a stock price reflects all the future cash flows of a business, not just the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s important to consider that a forward P/E uses earnings per share, or EPS, in the denominator. EPS is itself a ratio, which is affected by the number of shares outstanding. So, if a company has plans to buy back a large percentage of its shares outstanding through a share repurchase program, investors may be willing to pay more for its earnings today.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations of forward P/E\nTo calculate a price-to-earnings ratio, a company needs to have earnings. But not every company produces positive earnings for its shareholders.\nEarly-stage growth companies often produce losses, but their operations show strong potential for earnings at some point in the future. While they invest to grow the business, leverage their fixed operating expenses, and move toward profitability, their stocks technically trade for a negative P/E ratio.\nProfit\nEven when those companies start to make a profit, their relatively minuscule profits relative to the number of shares outstanding can lead to P/E ratios with triple or even quadruple digits. Those valuations aren\u2019t useful for an investing thesis, and forward P/E falls flat in those cases.\nInvestors will be better off finding a different valuation metric to compare growth stocks that are still generating losses for investors. Just because they have extremely high or non-existent forward P/E ratios doesn\u2019t make them bad investments."

  "argos_summary": "Celsius Holdings has reported strong second-quarter results, driven significantly by its acquisition of Alani Nu, which saw retail sales increase by 129%. Overall sales surged 84% to $739.3 million, exceeding analyst expectations, with North American sales jumping 87%. Despite the positive momentum, concerns about valuation arise as the stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of approximately 42.5, leading to caution about potential overvaluation and a preference for buying on a pullback.",
