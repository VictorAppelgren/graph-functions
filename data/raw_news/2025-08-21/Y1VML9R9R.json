  "title": "Ram Gopal Varma slams \u2018dumb\u2019 dog lovers, netizens fire back; catch all his controversial posts on Supreme Court\u2019s verdict row",
  "description": "Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma stirred up a storm with his bold take on the stray dogs issue, sparking a wave of reactions from netizens. Here\u2019s the full lowdown and all the tweets by him that is causing the buzz.",
  "content": "Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has responded strongly to a section of social media calling him a \u2018dog hater\u2019 after he supported the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to move all stray dogs in Delhi-NCR to shelters within eight weeks.\n\nFilmmaker Ram Gopal Varma has responded strongly to a section of social media calling him a \u2018dog hater\u2019 | Credit: IMDb\n\nOn August 21, Varma took to X (formerly Twitter) to explain his stance, saying the stray dog problem has gone too far to ignore and solutions must balance compassion with practicality.\n\nIn his post, Varma wrote, \u201cGiving a thought to the possible solutions, vaccinating some 8 crore dogs sounds great in your drawing room setting. In reality, try chasing down one street dog with a needle and multiply that by crores. And even if vaccinated, the dogs' minds won\u2019t suddenly turn into gentle deer-like minds, they\u2019ll still tear children apart. Only difference: now the kids will die with their throats ripped out, but without rabies.\u201d\n\nHe also addressed cleanliness drives, adding, \u201cExpecting the system to sterilize crores of dogs and maintain perfect garbage hygiene is like expecting pigs to wear pants.\u201d\n\nIn his post, Varma wrote, \u201cGiving a thought to the possible solutions | Credit: X/@anishgawande\n\nOn adoption, Varma said, \u201cThe dog lovers who cry hoarse about compassion are the same people buying foreign breeds to keep them in luxury houses, which are well looked after by expensive vets. Just try to tell the dog lovers to take stray dogs in exchange for their pedigreed breeds.\u201d\n\nVarma criticized community feeding as well, writing, \u201cWhen the dog lovers feed strays in one spot, they will gather in packs and become highly territorial and start attacking passersby, children, cyclists, delivery boys, even old people, because they then will see humans as \u2018intruders\u2019 near their feeding zone. Just remember how even your pet dog seems to get aggressive when feeding.\u201d\n\nHe further noted, \u201cFeeding usually happens on street corners, garbage heaps, or outside temples. Food scraps mix with sewage and rotting matter, turning into putrid, disease-breeding sludge, and the stray packs will wallow in this filth and then wander into the streets, spreading diseases.\u201d\n\nThe comment section quickly filled with opinions, reigniting the debate. One user wrote, \"I hope you research your films better than this story you are spinning. Why don\u2019t you use some data? It would be more believable.\" Another user said, \"You can write long posts with your thoughts, and we can still smell leftist ideology in this one.\"\n\nBefore this, Varma shared another post addressing the same issue. A part of his post read, \"To all those dumb dog lovers who think I am a dog hater, I say this\u2014are you so blind, deaf, and brain-dead that you can\u2019t see children being bitten, mauled, and killed on CCTV videos everywhere? Can\u2019t you read the official reports on rising rabies cases? In any emergency\u2014fire, flood, riots\u2014you first deal with immediate dangers before debating long-term solutions.\"\n\nTake a look at how netizens reacted to this.\n\nEarlier, on August 16, Varma had shared a series of posts criticizing animal lovers who opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s order. He offered satirical \u201csolutions\u201d for critics, writing, \u201cSince you worship dogs more than humans, replace gods in temples with strays and pray to them for salvation.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cIf the dog lovers are blaming the government administrators, they should go and bite the officers and politicians on their legs.\u201d\n\nCheck out a few more posts from him.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s directive, issued by a bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, instructs that all stray dogs in Delhi and the NCR be captured within eight weeks and housed in special shelters created by civic authorities. The court clarified that once a stray is caught, it will not be released back onto the streets. Anyone obstructing the process could face contempt of court proceedings. Authorities are also required to launch a dedicated helpline for reporting dog bite incidents, with the dog to be caught within four hours of a complaint.\n\nFollowing criticism and backlash, a separate three-judge bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta, and NV Anjaria has reserved its order on an interim plea seeking a stay on the directive.\n\n\n\nTo stay updated on the stories that are going viral follow Indiatimes Trending.",
