      "feedback": "Overall, the draft lays a solid probabilistic regime framework and ties macro/policy/inflation/oil/FX into cross‑market flows and a long‑horizon valuation view, with credible anchor sources (NL5YYTLF2, SGB2PAZGK, 22PL3Q360, J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX, R3WNA7L7A) and concrete numbers (Ford, ACMR) to ground the narrative; however, the causal chain from regime shifts to S&P 500 earnings/valuations is underdeveloped, the scenario structure is underspecified (no explicit invalidation criteria or sensitivity depths), and several claims would benefit from cleaner sourcing discipline and tighter formatting. Actionable edits: (1) anchor the analysis in a first‑principles chain—inflation persistence and wage growth drive discount rates and risk premia, which in turn shape equity valuations and capex/ROIC dynamics; explicitly map how each cross‑topic driver (macro, policy, flows, valuation/technicals) feeds a measurable channel (e.g., earnings power, duration, CAPE/multiple). (2) Replace the single “base map” with three explicit scenarios (A/B/C) that are fully spelled out with event triggers, probabilistic weights, and clear invalidation conditions; link each scenario to concrete catalysts (Jackson Hole communications, semis capex cadence, tariff developments, oil supply/demand shifts) and quantify their impact on earnings and valuations where possible. (3) Strengthen the watch‑list into 6–8 decisive signals with thresholds and deadlines, e.g., wage‑growth momentum changes; Jackson Hole guidance vs. capex pacing; OPEC energy balance shifts; oil price regime breakpoints; euro core inflation surprises; and 10Y yield/term premium moves, tying each to a concrete market reaction. (4) Tighten quantitative discipline: ensure all numbers come from the cited IDs, fix any unit inconsistencies (e.g., mbpd, revenue/margin shares, ROIC), and present a single base case with a symmetric set of upside/downside sensitivities (e.g., if Regime A expands by +10pp, what is S&P 500 multiple and earnings yield impact?). (5) Reconcile potential conflicts between sources (oil Regime A vs Regime B implications for risk premia; euro inflation paths vs US inflation expectations) by stating explicit assumptions and where the conflicts would invalidate one thread of the thesis. (6) Clean up formatting and ensure each factual claim is traceable to a source ID; avoid duplicative phrasing and ensure consistent parentheses and citation cadence (e.g., NL5YYTLF2, SGB2PAZGK, 22PL3Q360, J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX, R3WNA7L7A) without introducing external data. (7) Consider a concise appendix or one‑screen schematic that maps each driver to the corresponding regime, probability band, trigger, and expected market implication to aid readability under the SECTION FOCUS.",
