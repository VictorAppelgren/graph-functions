  "title": "Olivia Smith Admits Meeting Marta At 2015 World Cup Changed Her Life",
  "description": "The day she lost her position as the world\u2019s most expensive female player, Olivia Smith, the first to move for a million pounds, admits she never worried about her price.",
  "content": "The day she lost her position as the world\u2019s most expensive female player, Olivia Smith - the first to move for a million pounds - admits she never worried about her price.\n\nThis week, Smith collected the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA) award for the best Young Player of the Year last season. Her eye-catching performances for Liverpool earned her the illustrious accolade and in doing so, she became the first foreign woman to ever be voted in by her fellow professionals.\n\nSmith had already made the move last month from Liverpool to Arsenal with the new European club champions paying a transfer fee of $1.36 million (\u00a31 million). She therefore became the first woman in the English game to move for over a million British pounds.\n\nEarlier today, Orlando Pride broke that record by signing Jacqueline Ovalle from Tigres in Mexico for a reported $1.5 million. Smith had held the position for a mere 35 days but there will be never be another first within the English game. The transfer in January of the United States defender Naomi Girma made her the first million dollar player but amounted to less in sterling.\n\nThe one million pound threshold was first crossed in the men\u2019s game 46 years ago when Trevor Francis moved from Birmingham City to Nottingham Forest. That move came 25 years before Smith was even born but she is all too aware of the significance of his name.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, a price tag is a price tag, she said when questioned about her seven-figure valuation. \"It\u2019s not something I\u2019m really focused on. I\u2019m just focused on being on the pitch, learning from a great set of players. I think it\u2019s also great to see the development of women\u2019s football and that price going up as well. Obviously, it\u2019s an honor to have achieved that.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo come with such a hefty price tag, for such a young player like me, I think they see the potential that I have. They see, like my mum said, I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m driven, I want to learn, I want to grow and I want to win things ultimately. The money is not really a big deal for me.\u201d\n\nSmith will be moving club for the third year in succession having joined Liverpool from Sporting CP in Lisbon the previous summer. A young woman living on another contintent, she concedes that relocating constantly is \u201cnot comfortable, but you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite tough for me personally, not knowing what\u2019s going to come next. My first year in Europe, I never expected to leave Sporting after one season. It\u2019s not easy, especially when my family is so far away, but it does make transitions easier, building relationships with people here.\u201d\n\nAt Arsenal she will at least link up with one old acquaintance, the United States international Jenna Nighswonger. Their paths briefly crossed at Florida State University before Smith opted to go to Penn State. \u201cI didn\u2019t stay there long,\u201d she admits, \u201cbut she was my mentor for about two or three months when I first arrived there.\u201d\n\nSome will question where Smith will fit into the Arsenal line-up where she is competing for a starting position against three Ballon D\u2019Or nominees - Alessia Russo, Mariona Caldentey and Chloe Kelly - as well as the scorer of the winning goal in the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League final, Stina Blackstenius, the Player of the Tournament at the last UEFA Women\u2019s Euro. Beth Mead, and Australian Caitlin Foord.\n\nSmith is however is relishing the challenge. \u201cThe biggest thing is that I\u2019m very versatile. I spoke to (coach) Ren\u00e9e Slegers about this. I just want to be out on the pitch but at the same time, I\u2019m competing with the best players in the world so we\u2019re just pushing each other to be better every day and I\u2019m learning from them as well to add to my game. At the end of the day, it\u2019s up to Ren\u00e9e based on performance but I\u2019m working hard, giving it 100% - yeah still learning and growing.\u201d\n\nSmith was ten years of age when Canada hosted the 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup. Inspiring girls like Smith was behind the \u201cTo A Greater Goal\u201d slogan of the tournament. Growing up in Whitby, Ontario, close to Toronto, the nearest host city to her was almost 350km away in Ottawa. She told me that did not stop her watching some of the games in person.\n\nShe joked \u201cit kind of sucked that it wasn\u2019t in Toronto but my family and I actually made the trips to go and watch games and I think that was really special for me. I actually remember attending the Brazil game that was in Montr\u00e9al. As a lot of people probably know, Marta is also one of my biggest idols that I modelled my game after.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty special watching that World Cup, and I think that was also a turning point in my career realistically. I had actually gotten the chance to speak to Marta and she gave me a lot of insight on what it\u2019s like growing up not having women\u2019s football idols, because she didn\u2019t have one. I think it\u2019s so special now for the girls to look up to people like us doing what we do.\u201d",

      "text": "A European champion with her club and country this year, Arsenal\u2019s Alessia Russo is emerging as one of the leading contenders to win the prestigious Ballon D\u2019Or in 2025.\nThe 30-player shortlist for the award will be announced today by France Football magazine and Russo is sure to be among several of England\u2019s UEFA Women\u2019s Euro winning squad to be nominated. The 26-year-old scored in the final against Spain and was also her club\u2019s top scorer in the Women\u2019s Super League and UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League.\nFirst awarded in 2018, there have only been four different winners of the Ballon D\u2019Or F\u00e9minin in the award\u2019s history - Ada Hegerberg, Megan Rapinoe, Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmat\u00ed. The highest-placed English players have been Lucy Bronze in 2019 and Beth Mead in 2022, who both finished second in the rankings.\nAlexia and Aitana are once again strong candidates to win the Ballon D\u2019Or, but neither had as consistent a tournament as Russo. Alexia was the star of the group stage, scoring three goals and providing four assists in the first three games but her performances tailed off in the knockout stages from that incredibly high standard.\nAitana, the winner of the Ballon D\u2019Or in the previous two years was for the third year in succession voted the MVP in the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League. However, she did not start the UEFA Women\u2019s Euro after contracting viral meningitis ahead of the tournament. She returned to great effect in the knockout stages with a a backheel assist in the quarter-final and the extra-time winner in the semi-final.\nUltimately however, as in the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League final, Russo triumphed over her Spanish rivals for the main trophy. Aitana missed one of the penalties in the UEFA Women\u2019s Euro final shoot-out. She was nevertheless voted the Player of the Tournament and an unprecedented hat-trick of Ballon D\u2019Or awards cannot be ruled out.\nRusso has never before even been shortlisted, even after her impressive performances leading the line for England at the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in 2023. Now an Arsenal player, competing in the Women\u2019s Champions League, her media profile has risen and her all-round game has improved.\nMore than just a number nine, she has often played deeper for club and country contributing assists as well as goals. Criticised for her lack of goals at the UEFA Women\u2019s Euro this summer, she provided the final pass for three of England\u2019s goals at the championship. It was no surprise when she was one of four Lionesses voted into the Team of the Tournament by UEFA\u2019s Technical Observer Group.\nUnlike other awards, the winner of the Ballon D\u2019Or is entirely selected by a jury of specialised journalists from the top 50-ranked countries in the women\u2019s game based on the latest FIFA Women\u2019s World Rankings. There is one representative per country.\nEach juror selects their ten best players in descending order from the shortlist of thirty. The ten selected players are awarded 15, 12, 10, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point respectively. The Ballon d\u2019Or is awarded to the player with the highest number of points.\nUniquely, the Ballon D\u2019Or sets out specific criteria for the winner. Not merely a prize for the world\u2019s best player, the following factors are taken into account -individual performances, decisive and impressive character; team performances and achievements; class and fair play.\nIn all those categories, Russo will score highly this year. One of two players to start the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions and UEFA Women\u2019s Euro finals for the winning side, she scored 20 goals for Arsenal in all competitions for the first time in her career. Her eight goals in the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League is the highest-ever total by an English woman in the competition. In May, she was voted the women\u2019s Player of tbe Year by her country\u2019s Football Writers\u2019 Association.\nHistorically, the Ballon D\u2019Or has gone to the leading player in a team which has won either the Champions League or a major international tournament within the season in question. There would also therefore be a strong case for the England captain Leah Williamson, who was imperious withstanding countless waves of attack from FC Barcelona and Spain in those two finals.\nThe cut off period of assessment for this award came almost immediately after the UEFA Women\u2019s Euro final on July 31. Therefore, the Player of the Tournament performance from Marta in the final of the Copa Am\u00e9rica Femenina last weekend came too late to be used in her favor. That is not to say, that some judges may be swayed to award the six-time FIFA Women\u2019s World Player of the Year her first Ballon D\u2019Or at the venerable age of 39.\nOnly four English players have ever won the Ballon D\u2019Or, which was first awarded in the men\u2019s game back in 1956. Stanley Matthews was the inaugural recipient in that year. Ten years later, Bobby Charlton was the next English winner on the back of England\u2019s triumph in the 1966 FIFA World Cup.\nKevin Keegan won the Ballon D\u2019Or twice while representing German club Hamburger SV in 1978 and 1979. The only English player to win the award this century was forward Michael Owen in 2001, If she wins Russo will not only end that 24 year wait but also become the first woman from outside Spain, and FC Barcelona, to lift the award since Rapinoe in 2019.\nThe winners of the the 2025 Ballon D\u2019Or will be announced on September 22 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris."

      "text": "Canada\u2019s 20-year-old forward Olivia Smith is now the most expensive female soccer player in the world joining European champions Arsenal for $1.3 million. She joins Arsenal after competing for Liverpool for a year.\nSmith succeeds Naomi Girma ($1.1 million) as the most expensive female player in the world. She is the first Canadian in the men\u2019s or women\u2019s game to transfer for a record fee. It is also the first world record transfer in the women\u2019s game between two clubs from the same country in 24 years.\nSmith said the move was \"a privilege and an honor to sign for Arsenal. It\u2019s my dream to compete for the biggest titles here in England and in Europe and I\u2019m excited to get started and contribute to doing that here with Arsenal. The atmosphere the supporters create at Emirates Stadium is incredible and I can\u2019t wait to have that behind me now.\u201d\nArsenal stated that they signed Smith for \"an undisclosed fee\". However, earlier this year it was reported that Chelsea paid an excess of $1.1 million to the San Diego Wave for United States defender Girma. It is understood that Smith has signed a four-year contract at Arsenal.\nSmith is by far the youngest female player to move for a world record transfer fee. The last player in the game\u2019s history to move in a world record transfer at a younger age was the legendary Brazilian Ronaldo Lu\u00eds Naz\u00e1rio de Lima when he left PSV Eindhoven for FC Barcelona at 19 years, 10 months.\nIn 2019, Smith became the youngest ever player to represent the Canadian national team at 15 years and 94 days. She appeared at the 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup at 18. She has uniquely won the award for Canadian Youth Player of the Year twice in five years, in 2019 and 2024.\nAfter signing for Liverpool, the rapier striker impressed on her debut season in the Women\u2019s Super League. She started 24 games and scored seven league goals and nine in all competitions. Smith ended as the club\u2019s leading goalscorer. She also became the first Liverpool Women\u2019s player to score a goal at the club\u2019s legendary Anfield stadium.\nHaving joined Liverpool from Sporting Clube de Portugal for a transfer fee of $269,000 just over a year ago, Smith has set another record. She is now the leading player in terms of accumulated transfer fees in the history of the women\u2019s game with those two moves amounting to $1.4 million surpassing the $1.1 million paid for Keira Walsh during the course of her career.\nAll of the rest of the top ten fees in the women\u2019s game have involved international transfers. The big-money move by Smith between two Women\u2019s Super League clubs is unusual. It is four times the previous record between two English clubs set when Bethany England left Chelsea moving to Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of $300,000 in January 2023.\nArsenal\u2019s Director of Women\u2019s Football, Clare Wheatley admitted \"we\u2019re thrilled to bring Olivia to Arsenal. She\u2019s one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here at the club. On behalf of everyone at Arsenal, I\u2019d like to welcome Olivia to Arsenal and congratulate her on this special moment.\u201d\nHaving already tied Chloe Kelly and Jessie Gale to permanent contacts this summer, Arsenal now have eleven forwards on their senior squad including the stars of the England (Alessia Russo), Spain (Mariona Caldentey) and Sweden (Stina Blackstenius) national teams still competing at the UEFA Women\u2019s Euro.\nIn comparison, eight international forwards are on the Chelsea squad. Arsenal aims to topple Chelsea in the Women\u2019s Super League after their six years of domestic dominance. Finding a regular starting position for Smith will be a challenge. Nonetheless Arsenal head coach Ren\u00e9e Slegers said \u201cOlivia is an exciting young player and we believe she can make a big contribution here at Arsenal.\"\n\"We\u2019ve been impressed by her mentality and character, excelling in two European leagues at such a young age. I know she has a level of ambition that matches our own and we\u2019re looking forward to working with her as she continues to grow at the club.\u201d\nSmith will wear the number 15 jersey which was, until last season, worn by fan favorite Katie McCabe, who now wears the number 11 shirt. The transfer is subject to the completion of regulatory processes."

      "text": "United States women's national team defender Naomi Girma has joined Women's Super League champions Chelsea for a world record transfer fee of over $1 million.\nThe defender was unveiled at Stamford Bridge today ahead of Chelsea's Women's Super League match against Arsenal. Speaking to the Chelsea website, Girma said \"I\u2019m so happy and really excited to be here. It doesn\u2019t feel real.\"\n\"There are a lot of things about Chelsea that made me want to come here - the culture, the winning mentality, staff and players. It\u2019s a top environment to learn and grow in. Right now, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking to do. It was an easy choice for me.\"\nThe transfer will put Girma down in history as the first-ever woman to move for a fee of over $1 million. The record transfer fee was previously the $862,000 paid by Bay FC to Madrid CFF for Zambian striker Rachael Kundananji in February 2024.\nThe move comes 57 years after the first $1 million transfer in the men's game when Pietro Anastasi joined Juventus from Varese in 1968. Girma is also the first-ever player from the United States, either in the men's or women's game, to move for a world record transfer fee.\nThe 24-year-old Girma, who was contracted with San Diego Wave in the NWSL until the end of 2026, has agreed terms to sign a four and a half deal with Chelsea. She will wear the number 16 shirt previously worn by former club captain Magdalena Eriksson.\nUpon leaving the NWSL, Girma admitted that \"San Diego Wave has been such an important part of my journey. I\u2019ll forever be thankful for the opportunities I\u2019ve had to grow here and for the incredible relationships I\u2019ve built with my teammates, the sporting staff, and our amazing fans.\"\n\"I\u2019m especially grateful to ownership and Cami for supporting my dream of playing in Europe. San Diego will always hold a special place in my heart, and I wish nothing but the best for the team moving forward.\"\nIt is the second successive year in which the English champions have broken the world record for a transfer fee in the women's game. On January 26, 2024, Chelsea paid Levante $544,000 for the services of Mayra Ramirez on a four and a half year deal. Twelve months they have paid almost double for Girma.\nThe world record transfer fee in women's soccer has been paid almost exclusively for strikers, the one exception being the $470,000 paid by FC Barcelona for midfielder Keira Walsh in 2022. The same is true in the men's game where the world record transfer fee has almost exclusively been paid for forward players.\nIt is over a century since the record was broken for a defensive player. In 1922, Sunderland paid \u00a35,500 to South Shields for full back Warney Cresswell. It was a record which stood until December 1925. 100 years on Girma is the first-ever central defender in the men's or women's game to move for a world record sum.\nIn 2023, Girma also become the first defender to win the U.S. Soccer Women's Player of the Year in four decades of the award. She was part of the United States defence which conceded just one goal at the Women's World Cup. Last summer, she played every minute of the 2024 Olympic Games, helping the United States achieve three successive shutouts in the knockout stages as they won the Gold Medal.\nIn October, Girma scored the first-ever goals of her professional career, finding the net twice for the United States against Argentina in Louisiana. She is yet to score a single goal at club level in three years as a professional at San Diego Wave.\nChelsea's Head of Women's Football Paul Green said \"Naomi is a world-class defender who is now coming into the prime years of her career. Her composure on the ball, ability to read the game coupled with her pace and athleticism will add top quality to an already very talented squad. Naomi has showcased her talent in the NWSL winning various individual awards and delivered on the international stage for the USA, including this summer winning a gold medal at the Olympics.\""

      "text": "Ren\u00e9e Slegers, the interim head coach of Arsenal since October 15, has finally been offered a contract and will become the ninth different permanent manager of the club.\nThe future of Slegers has dragged on throughout the winter with the Dutchwoman initially appointed for two games as the club began their process of finding a permanent head coach. With no further development, Slegers' tenure was extended until the Christmas break and then again in January as the recruitment process entered its fourth month.\nAs other potential candidates for the job like Nick Cushing and Casey Stoney have ruled themselves out of the running, so Slegers, who as a player was part of the Arsenal youth academy, has impressed the squad and media alike with her understated style and results on the pitch.\nSlegers is the first woman to lead the club in over a decade. The 35-year-old was first hired as assistant coach to Jonas Eidevall in September 2023, succeeding the Swede after a poor start to the season culminating in successive defeats to FC Bayern and Chelsea. Slegers said at the time \"I\u2019m happy to do it because I care about the team, I care about the players. I\u2019ve been here for a year now. It\u2019s a massive club so I\u2019m happy to help.\"\nIn contrast to Eidevall, Slegers is unbeaten in eleven matches as interim head coach, winning ten and drawing one including five victories in the UEFA Women's Champions League which saw Arsenal overhaul the Bayern side which defeated them 5--2 in October to ultimately win their group ahead of them.\nFive victories out of six in the Women's Super League have also seen Arsenal haul themselves back into the top three. Their title aspirations will be put to the test next weekend when they travel to Stamford Bridge for the return fixture against the unbeaten champions Chelsea, whom they currently trail by seven points.\nSuch has been Slegers impact that she was last week named as the WSL Manager of the Month for December. Her appointment has also revitalised the form of striker Alessia Russo who has scored in five successive league games and ten in total since Slegers took charge.\n\"I\u2019m so excited to be continuing our journey together.\" said Slegers. \"It\u2019s a wonderful honor to represent this club as head coach and I have so much belief in what we can all achieve together.\"\n\"Over the past few months, I\u2019ve felt such a powerful sense of collective ownership and responsibility across our players and staff \u2013 that has been our strength and I know we will make sure we drive and nurture this feeling as we all move forward.\"\n\"It has meant the world to me to feel the closeness and passion of our supporters during this process, and I want to thank you all for that. We want to deliver something beautiful that\u2019s inspiring and leads to winning trophies.
