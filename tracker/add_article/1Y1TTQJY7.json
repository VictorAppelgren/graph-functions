      "summary": "Russia is pursuing a strategy to dismantle NATO through hybrid threats, conducting sabotage of critical infrastructure such as DHL hubs and railways across Europe. The attacks highlight vulnerabilities in NATO’s logistics backbone, prompting calls for re‑armament and investment in infrastructure, notably the Corridor 8 upgrade linking the Adriatic to the Black Sea. NATO must strengthen its physical deterrence to prevent a conventional attack on a member before 2029 and to safeguard its eastern flank. The UK‑North Macedonia partnership and £5 billion UK Export Finance support aim to accelerate these upgrades, but Washington must also back similar projects to maintain transatlantic security.",
