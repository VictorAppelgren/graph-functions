  "title": "Two Bills Could Rewrite Colorado\u2019s AI Law: Here\u2019s What\u2019s At Stake",
  "description": "Lawmakers weigh two competing AI bills that could reshape employer obligations under the Colorado's AI law. Here\u2019s what\u2019s changing, and what businesses need to do next.",
  "content": "Colorado\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act, the first state law of its kind, is scheduled to take effect in February 2026. As that date approaches, lawmakers are reconsidering the path they set just months ago. In a special session, two competing proposals have emerged, each offering a different vision for how Colorado should regulate AI. While one would narrow employer obligations and delay enforcement, the other would expand transparency requirements, impose joint liability, and hold firm to the original timeline.\n\nTogether, the Rodriguez and Lindstedt bills offer a revealing look at how far the debate over AI accountability has progressed, and how uncertain the legal landscape remains for employers who rely on automated systems to make or inform employment decisions.\n\nA Quick Look at the Law as It Stands\n\nUnder the Colorado AI Act, employers that use artificial intelligence or automated decision systems to make, or substantially influence, employment decisions must be prepared to comply with one of the most comprehensive AI regulatory frameworks in the country. The law applies to any AI system deemed \u201chigh-risk,\u201d which includes tools that affect an individual\u2019s access to employment, housing, education, credit, or insurance.\n\nFor employers, the obligations are significant. Deployers of high-risk systems must conduct annual impact assessments, monitor for discriminatory outcomes, and implement a risk management policy designed to mitigate algorithmic bias. They must also notify individuals when high-risk AI is used in a consequential decision, provide reasons for adverse outcomes, offer a path for correction, and, where feasible, ensure that meaningful human review is available through an appeal process. In most cases, organizations are also required to publish a statement describing how they use high-risk AI and the safeguards they have in place.\n\nThe law includes a narrow carve-out for small businesses that meet specific criteria, and enforcement authority rests exclusively with the Attorney General, who may bring actions under Colorado\u2019s consumer protection law. Organizations that discover and cure violations and can demonstrate alignment with a recognized AI risk management framework, may assert an affirmative defense.\n\nBut all of this could change, depending on which bill, if any, advances during the current legislative session.\n\nSenator Robert Rodriguez, who sponsored the original law, has introduced a bill that would repeal most of the existing framework and replace it with a new model focused on transparency and individual rights. While the bill retains the core principle that developers and deployers of AI systems must protect against discrimination, it pivots from a risk-management and governance approach to a disclosure-driven model that relies on consumer-facing notices and explanations.\n\nUnder the Rodriguez proposal, employers using an AI system that materially affects employment decisions would be required to provide candidates with specific disclosures before deploying the system and again within 30 days after it affects the individual. The initial notice must include the name of the developer, the trade name and version of the system, and a description of when and how the system is used during the hiring process. The follow-up disclosure would need to explain the types and sources of personal characteristics used and identify the most influential factors driving the system\u2019s output, up to a maximum of 20.\n\nIndividuals would also gain the right to access and correct the information used in such decisions, and both developers and deployers would be required to implement procedures to support those rights. Vendors would need to provide detailed documentation covering intended and foreseeable uses, foreseeable misuses, and steps taken to mitigate legal risks.\n\nMost notably, the Rodriguez bill imposes joint and several liability on developers and deployers for violations resulting from a deployer\u2019s use of an AI system. While developers could defend against liability by demonstrating that the harm was not reasonably foreseeable and that appropriate mitigation efforts were in place, the exposure risk to employers would grow substantially, especially for those relying on third-party systems they do not control.\n\nTiming is also critical. Unlike some proposals to delay enforcement, the Rodriguez bill preserves the February 1, 2026, effective date for key employer obligations. That means compliance work already underway would remain necessary, albeit with different outputs and enforcement considerations.\n\nIn contrast, Representative Lindstedt\u2019s bill, \u201cConcerning Consumer Protections In Interactions With Artificial Intelligence Systems,\u201d takes a narrower approach. Rather than regulating the full lifecycle of high-risk AI, it focuses on real-time interactions between consumers and AI systems. For employers, this would mean fewer programmatic requirements and no need for ongoing assessments or risk management frameworks.\n\nThe Lindstedt proposal would require employers to disclose, at the outset of an interaction, that a candidate is engaging with an AI system when that interaction relates to an employment opportunity. The disclosure would need to include the developer\u2019s name, the system\u2019s trade name, and contact information for the employer. This obligation would apply to any interactive AI system, such as a chatbot or automated screening tool, unless the AI nature is obvious or an exception applies.\n\nUnlike the Rodriguez bill, the Lindstedt proposal sets an effective date of January 1, 2027, giving employers an additional year to adapt. It also avoids imposing joint liability, focusing instead on clear disclosures and enforcement through the Attorney General\u2019s office. Violations would constitute a deceptive trade practice, and affected individuals could also pursue claims under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act if the AI interaction results in unlawful bias.\n\nWhile less burdensome in scope, the Lindstedt bill still signals that employers cannot ignore AI compliance. Even under this more limited framework, employers would need to carefully track where and how interactive systems are used and ensure that required disclosures are delivered clearly and consistently.\n\nWhy This Matters for Employers\n\nFor companies using AI to support hiring, promotion, or workforce decisions, both bills demand attention, albeit for different reasons. The Rodriguez bill would accelerate transparency and deepen exposure by requiring individualized disclosures and tying liability to both ends of the vendor relationship. The Lindstedt bill, while lighter, underscores the importance of disclosure at the point of interaction and introduces new compliance obligations for chatbot-based or automated screening tools.\n\nWhat unites both proposals is the expectation that employers understand how their AI systems work, and that they take responsibility for communicating that understanding to individuals affected by the technology. Whether the law requires a full impact assessment and public statement or a simple disclosure at the beginning of a conversation, the message is the same: employers must ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in how they deploy automated systems.\n\nAs lawmakers weigh these competing approaches, employers should not wait. Even if the law ultimately shifts course, it is clear that AI in hiring will remain a point of regulatory focus. Employers that begin mapping their systems, documenting how decisions are made, and clarifying who bears responsibility for compliance will be better positioned to meet whatever obligations emerge from the Capitol.\n\nColorado\u2019s AI law, in any form, is pushing the state toward a future where transparency and fairness are central to automated decision-making. The question now is whether that future arrives through structured risk governance, or a sharper focus on disclosure and shared responsibility.",

      "text": "Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence\nOn and after February 1, 2026, the act requires a developer of a high-risk artificial intelligence system (high-risk system) to use reasonable care to protect consumers from any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination in the high-risk system. There is a rebuttable presumption that a developer used reasonable care if the developer complied with specified provisions in the act, including:\n- Making available to a deployer of the high-risk system a statement disclosing specified information about the high-risk system;\n- Making available to a deployer of the high-risk system information and documentation necessary to complete an impact assessment of the high-risk system;\n- Making a publicly available statement summarizing the types of high-risk systems that the developer has developed or intentionally and substantially modified and currently makes available to a deployer or other developer and how the developer manages any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination that may arise from the development or intentional and substantial modification of each of these high-risk systems; and\n- Disclosing to the attorney general and known deployers or other developers of the high-risk system any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination, within 90 days after the discovery or receipt of a credible report from the deployer, that the high-risk system has caused or is reasonably likely to have caused.\nThe act also, on and after February 1, 2026, requires a deployer of a high-risk system to use reasonable care to protect consumers from any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination in the high-risk system. There is a rebuttable presumption that a deployer used reasonable care if the deployer complied with specified provisions in the act, including:\n- Implementing a risk management policy and program for the high-risk system;\n- Completing an impact assessment of the high-risk system;\n- Annually reviewing the deployment of each high-risk system deployed by the deployer to ensure that the high-risk system is not causing algorithmic discrimination;\n- Notifying a consumer of specified items if the high-risk system makes, or will be a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision concerning the consumer;\n- Providing a consumer with an opportunity to correct any incorrect personal data that a high-risk system processed in making a consequential decision;\n- Providing a consumer with an opportunity to appeal, via human review if technically feasible, an adverse consequential decision concerning the consumer arising from the deployment of a high-risk system;\n- Making a publicly available statement summarizing the types of high-risk systems that the deployer currently deploys, how the deployer manages any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination that may arise from deployment of each of these high-risk systems, and the nature, source, and extent of the information collected and used by the deployer; and\n- Disclosing to the attorney general the discovery of algorithmic discrimination, within 90 days after the discovery, that the high-risk system has caused.\nA person doing business in this state, including a deployer or other developer, that deploys or makes available an artificial intelligence system that is intended to interact with consumers must ensure disclosure to each consumer who interacts with the artificial intelligence system that the consumer is interacting with an artificial intelligence system.\nThe act does not restrict a developer's, deployer's, or other person's ability to engage in specified activities, including:\n- Complying with federal, state, or municipal laws, ordinances, or regulations;\n- Cooperating with and conducting specified investigations;\n- Taking immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of a consumer;\n- Conducting and engaging in specified research activities; and\n- Effectuating a product recall or repairing technical errors that impair product functionality.\nThe act provides an affirmative defense for a developer, deployer, or other person if:\n- The developer, deployer, or other person involved in a potential violation is in compliance with a nationally or internationally recognized risk management framework for artificial intelligence systems that the act or the attorney general designates; and\n- The developer, deployer, or other person takes specified measures to discover and correct violations of the act.\nAn insurer, a fraternal benefit society, or a developer of an artificial intelligence system used by an insurer is in full compliance with the act if the entity is subject to specified laws governing insurers' use of external consumer data and information sources, algorithms, and predictive models and rules adopted by the commissioner of insurance.\nA bank, out-of-state bank, credit union chartered by the state of Colorado, federal credit union, out-of-state credit union, or any affiliate or subsidiary thereof, is in full compliance with the act if the entity is subject to examination by a state or federal prudential regulator under any published guidance or regulations that apply to the use of high-risk systems and the guidance or regulations meet criteria specified in the act.\nThe act grants the attorney general rule-making authority to implement, and exclusive authority to enforce, the requirements of the act. A person who violates the act engages in a deceptive trade practice pursuant to the \"Colorado Consumer Protection Act\".\nAPPROVED by Governor May 17, 2024\nEFFECTIVE May 17, 2024\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)"

      "text": "Colorado\u2019s first-of-its-kind Artificial Intelligence Act (CAIA) may be about to change; or it may not. In less than six months, sweeping new compliance requirements could hit employers using AI in hiring and background checks. A special legislative session convening on August 21 will determine whether the law\u2019s February 1, 2026 effective date stands, whether its provisions are refined, or whether lawmakers adopt a hybrid approach that alters timelines and obligations.\nGovernor Jared Polis has signaled openness to changes, but Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, the bill\u2019s original sponsor, has drawn a red line: the law\u2019s core consumer protection provisions, including notices, appeal rights, and bias mitigation, are non-negotiable. That means any amendments will likely leave most of the compliance framework intact.\nWhy This Matters to Employers\nThe CAIA applies to both developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems. For employers, a \u201cdeployer\u201d is any business using AI to make or substantially influence consequential decisions about individuals, including hiring, promotion, and other employment actions.\nIn the employment context, high-risk AI can include tools such as automated resume screeners, candidate assessment platforms, and background scoring or adjudication systems that influence hiring decisions. This means many employers could need to stand up CAIA-compliant programs before their AI use is fully mature, or even while piloting tools in live hiring workflows.\nThat\u2019s not an insignificant group: according to HireRight\u2019s 2025 Global Benchmark Report, nearly one-third of North American employers plan to use AI or automated decision-making in their talent acquisition and workforce management programs. Notably, 45% said they were concerned about the impact of emerging AI regulations. In other words, the uncertainty employers feel now could quickly turn into compliance obligations next February.\nIf the law takes effect as written, Colorado employers using these tools will need to:\n- Maintain a risk management policy for AI systems, updated regularly.\n- Conduct annual impact assessments and additional assessments within 90 days of significant system changes.\n- Notify individuals when high-risk AI meaningfully influences a consequential decision and explain the AI system\u2019s role.\n- Offer an appeal process allowing individuals to contest the decision.\n- Post public disclosures on their websites about their high-risk AI use.\n- Retain records of assessments and risk management documentation for at least three years after deployment.\nEnforcement authority rests solely with the Colorado Attorney General. There is no private right of action, but violations are treated as unfair and deceptive trade practices. The law provides an affirmative defense for organizations that identify and correct violations through internal review or feedback processes, a structure that rewards proactive compliance.\nWhy the Law Is Back in Play\nGovernor Polis signed the CAIA with hesitation, warning it could impose \u201ca complex compliance regime\u201d that risks chilling innovation and deterring competition. In early 2025, lawmakers introduced a follow-up bill to narrow definitions, add exemptions for small businesses and FCRA-regulated background checks, and ease operational requirements. That effort failed in committee when consensus collapsed over changes viewed as weakening consumer protections, the same protections Rodriguez has since called untouchable.\nOn August 6, 2025, Governor Polis announced a special legislative session starting August 21. The official reason: closing a $1.2 billion budget shortfall caused by the federal \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d (H.R. 1). But among the topics on the table is the fiscal and operational impact of the CAIA on consumers, businesses, and government. Polis has suggested either delaying the effective date, potentially to 2027, or refining provisions to make the law more \u201cworkable and equitable.\u201d Rodriguez has said he never expected the CAIA to be \u201cover and done\u201d in 2024 and is willing to discuss adjustments, but has made clear that consumer protection mandates will remain.\nWhat Could Happen in the Special Session\nWhen lawmakers return to Denver, they\u2019ll have several choices, but the final outcome is likely to be a blend of political compromise and practical realities. A full delay of the CAIA\u2019s effective date to 2027 is possible, especially if it\u2019s framed as giving employers and state agencies more time to prepare. However, such a delay would need to avoid any perception of weakening consumer protections to have a chance of passing.\nAnother scenario is a refined law that still takes effect in 2026, but with narrower definitions of what counts as a \u201cconsequential decision\u201d or expanded exemptions for smaller businesses. These changes could remove some lower-risk tools from the law\u2019s scope, but most AI-assisted hiring systems would still be covered.\nLawmakers could also phase in compliance, delaying certain provisions while requiring partial adherence next February. That approach would give employers breathing room on the most complex requirements, but still demand that they stand up key elements, like consumer notices and appeals, on schedule.\nAnd it\u2019s entirely possible that the legislature will leave the statute unchanged and rely on the Attorney General\u2019s rulemaking process to clarify how it will be applied. That would place the onus squarely on employers to interpret the law conservatively until formal guidance is issued.\nWhat\u2019s clear is that Rodriguez\u2019s position on preserving the CAIA\u2019s consumer protection mandates will potentially influence every outcome. Even in the most business-friendly version of this law, employers will still likely need to prepare for transparency, disclosure, and bias mitigation requirements to remain at its core.\nWhat Employers Should Do Now\nWith less than six months until the CAIA\u2019s scheduled effective date, employers should shift from awareness to execution. The goal isn\u2019t necessarily to build every element of a compliance program today, it\u2019s to be positioned to move quickly once the legislature\u2019s decision is known.\nStart by identifying your highest-risk areas where AI meaningfully influences hiring or promotion decisions. These systems should be first in line for review and potential modification.\nSecure vendor cooperation early. Much of the CAIA\u2019s compliance burden depends on technical details only your vendors can provide. Opening those conversations now will avoid delays if full compliance is required in 2026.\nMap out a phased compliance plan. Structure your work so the most complex elements, like system audits and detailed disclosures, can be finalized quickly if the February deadline holds, but without overcommitting resources if definitions or timelines shift.\nFinally, designate an internal lead for AI compliance to coordinate risk assessments, documentation, and vendor engagement. Centralizing responsibility will make your program more agile if lawmakers create a phased rollout or narrow the scope of the law.\nBottom Line for Employers\nWhile the debate in Denver will focus on when the law takes effect and how it\u2019s enforced, the consumer protection mandates are very likely to remain. Employers should act now to build compliance programs that can withstand a February 2026 launch but keep them agile enough to adjust to new timelines or scope changes.\nIn other words, act as if the clock is still ticking toward February 2026, because it probably is."

      "text": "Colorado made history in 2024 by becoming the first state in the nation to enact comprehensive regulation of artificial intelligence. Senate Bill 24-205 (SB205), also known as the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (CAIA), established detailed compliance obligations for developers and users of \"high-risk\" AI systems operating in employment, housing, finance, health care, education, and essential government services.\nThe CAIA was intended to address concerns about algorithmic discrimination, requiring transparency, risk assessments, consumer disclosures, and risk mitigation by February 1, 2026. For employers using AI in hiring, the law introduced a sweeping new compliance landscape. While it was widely seen as a pioneering move, it also raised concerns about complexity, innovation, and unintended consequences.\nGovernor Polis' Reluctant Endorsement and Call for Change\nWhen Governor Jared Polis signed SB205 into law, he did so with notable hesitation. In his signing statement, Polis warned that the law creates a \"complex compliance regime\" that could \"tamper with innovation and deter competition\" by imposing heavy burdens on developers and deployers operating in Colorado or interacting with Colorado residents. He urged Congress to step in with federal regulation to prevent a patchwork of state AI laws that could stifle technological advancement across industries.\nPolis also highlighted a unique concern: the CAIA deviates from traditional discrimination frameworks by prohibiting all discriminatory outcomes from AI systems, regardless of intent. He encouraged Colorado lawmakers to reexamine this standard before the law\u2019s 2026 effective date.\nIn a rare public letter co-signed by Governor Polis, Attorney General Phil Weiser, and Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, state leaders acknowledged the risks tied to the CAIA\u2019s broad definitions and disclosure requirements. They pledged to minimize unintended consequences and encouraged future refinements to protect innovation while ensuring fairness.\nSB25-318: A Measured Response That Fell Short\nIn 2025, legislators introduced Senate Bill 25-318 (SB318) as an attempt to refine and soften SB205 before its effective compliance date. SB318 proposed thoughtful amendments, including narrowing the definition of \"algorithmic discrimination\" to violations of existing anti-discrimination laws, carving out exemptions for small businesses and open-source AI developers, clarifying appeal rights and disclosure obligations, easing requirements for companies using AI solely for recruitment and hiring of external candidates, and providing a critical exemption for AI systems producing consumer reports governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\nFor background screening companies and employers who rely on AI-assisted background checks, these changes were meaningful. SB318 recognized that services already regulated under the FCRA should not face duplicative AI compliance obligations and that employment decisions made with meaningful human review differ fundamentally from fully automated systems.\nAttorney General Phil Weiser, testifying before the Senate Business, Labor, and Technology Committee, warned that Colorado risked \"moving ahead too quickly in a complex area\" and recommended delaying the law\u2019s implementation by a year to avoid \"unintended consequences\" and protect the state's competitiveness in emerging technology sectors.\nDespite broad support from stakeholders across sectors, the proposed fix failed to gain consensus. On the final day of its committee hearing, Senator Rodriguez asked for SB318 to be postponed indefinitely, citing a lack of agreement and insufficient time to resolve complex concerns. Without legislative fixes, Colorado employers and AI developers must now prepare to comply with the original, more expansive law by February 1, 2026.\nWhere the Colorado AI Act May Offer Relief for Employers Using Background Checks\nDespite its challenges, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act provides several important safeguards for employers and background screening companies. Most notably, enforcement authority rests exclusively with the Colorado Attorney General. By excluding private rights of action, the law spares businesses from the added litigation risks often associated with emerging regulatory regimes. In addition, the law allows companies to assert an affirmative defense by showing that they identified and cured violations through internal processes, encouraging proactive compliance efforts rather than penalizing good-faith mistakes.\nThe Act also focuses its strictest obligations on AI systems that serve as the principal basis for consequential decisions without meaningful human involvement. This structure suggests that traditional background screening tools, which typically involve a human review of findings before an employment decision is made, may fall outside the most burdensome requirements. Under the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, the distinction between providing information to inform a decision and making the decision itself is critical. A consumer reporting agency that supplies background check reports, particularly under the Fair Credit Reporting Act\u2019s procedural safeguards, generally does not act as the final decision-maker. Instead, employers retain discretion and must undertake individualized assessments before taking adverse action, preserving meaningful human involvement.\nWhile Senate Bill 25-318 would have codified a clear exemption for systems governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, even without its passage, the law\u2019s emphasis on final decision-making authority may point toward more favorable treatment for employment background checks that comply with federal consumer reporting standards. However, employers should not assume that FCRA compliance alone will shield them from all AI-related obligations. How AI systems are deployed, the level of human review involved, and the extent to which automated outputs influence final decisions will remain critical factors in determining compliance risks under the Colorado AI Act.\nAreas of Compliance Concern for Employers and Consumer Reporting Agencies\nWhile these statutory protections may ease some compliance burdens, employers and consumer reporting agencies must remain mindful of several significant risks under the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act. The Act defines an \"artificial intelligence system\" broadly as any machine-based system that infers outputs from inputs, which risks capturing traditional automation tools and rules-based adjudication technologies not typically associated with adaptive learning or bias. Without a clear narrowing to machine-learning systems, background screening and compliance support tools could fall within the scope of regulation.\nThe definition of \"high-risk\" artificial intelligence systems also raises questions. Under the law, any AI system that substantially influences employment decisions could be deemed high-risk, even if the final decision involves meaningful human judgment. Employers using AI tools to assist in background checks or hiring assessments will need to carefully evaluate the level of human oversight embedded in their processes.\nThe law\u2019s consumer disclosure requirements may create operational burdens as well. Employers must notify individuals when AI meaningfully influences a consequential decision and must explain the system's role in the decision-making process. Meeting these requirements will likely depend on AI vendors providing detailed technical disclosures, which could present challenges if vendors are unwilling or unable to share the necessary information.\nFinally, recordkeeping requirements under the Act demand that companies retain documentation of impact assessments and risk management policies for at least three years after deploying a high-risk system. These obligations may impose additional recordkeeping burdens compared to existing federal standards under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations, creating potential tension between state and federal compliance frameworks. Employers will need to align their documentation procedures carefully to avoid conflicting retention obligations.\nParting Thoughts\nWhile Colorado\u2019s pioneering law reflects important goals of fairness and transparency in AI use, the failure to adopt SB318 leaves employers with significant compliance uncertainty. The original law\u2019s breadth risks capturing low-risk technologies and could dampen innovation in hiring, screening, and HR technology.\nEmployers using AI, whether directly or through third-party vendors, must take proactive steps now. Reviewing AI risk management practices, ensuring human oversight of decision-making processes, and preparing robust disclosures will be essential ahead of the February 1, 2026 deadline.\nIn the absence of federal intervention, Colorado's experience offers a preview of how states might shape the next chapter of AI regulation and why careful drafting will be key to balancing innovation with consumer protection."

      "text": "Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act\nThe act consolidates damages provisions for individuals with disabilities who experience discrimination in places of public accommodation or a violation of their civil rights with the general protections under the \"Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act\" (CADA) for all protected classes. With the consolidation of these provisions, the allowable remedies under CADA are a court order requiring compliance with the applicable section of CADA, attorney fees and costs, and either actual monetary damages and damages for noneconomic loss or injury or a statutory fine of $5,000 that is payable to each plaintiff for each violation. An award of damages for noneconomic loss or injury is capped at $50,000, and a defendant is entitled to a 50% reduction of the cap on a noneconomic loss or injury award if the defendant corrects the violation within 30 days of the complaint being filed and did not knowingly or intentionally make or cause to be made the violation. A defendant that cannot correct the violation in 30 days but shows good faith effort to correct the violation may be allowed up to 3 additional 30-day periods to correct the violation and be entitled to the 50% reduction of the cap on a noneconomic loss or injury award.\nAdditionally, for discriminatory advertising in violation of CADA and as an alternative to seeking redress from the Colorado civil rights commission, a person aggrieved by such violation may bring a civil action and, upon a finding of a violation, is entitled to a court order requiring compliance with the section of CADA prohibiting discriminatory advertising, attorney fees and costs, and either actual monetary damages and damages for noneconomic loss or injury or a statutory fine of $5,000 that is payable to each plaintiff for each violation. An award of damages for noneconomic loss or injury is capped at $50,000, and if a defendant is a small business, it is entitled to a 50% reduction of the cap on a noneconomic loss or injury award if it corrects the violation within 30 days of the complaint being filed and did not knowingly or intentionally make or cause to be made the violation.\nThe act adds the provision of a recommendation letter signed by an individual's treating medical professional recommending testing accommodations as a method for an individual with a disability to demonstrate the need for a testing accommodation on a licensing exam. The act appropriates $100,305 from the legal services cash fund to the department of law to implement the act.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)"

      "text": "Colorado is poised to become the first state in the U.S. to enact a comprehensive law addressing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in employment and other critical areas. The state legislature passed Senate Bill 24-205 (SB205) on May 8, and it now awaits the signature of Governor Jared Polis. This legislation, if signed into law, will take full effect in 2026 and aims to prevent algorithmic discrimination, requiring both developers and users of high-risk AI systems to adopt rigorous compliance measures.\nDefinition and Scope of AI Under the Act\nSB205 defines \"high-risk artificial intelligence systems\" as machine-based algorithms that significantly influence decisions in areas such as:\n- Employment and employment opportunities\n- Education enrollment and opportunities\n- Financial or lending services\n- Essential government services\n- Healthcare services\n- Housing\n- Insurance\n- Legal services\nThese AI systems are considered high-risk if they make or substantially contribute to consequential decisions impacting individuals or groups, potentially leading to differential treatment based on protected classifications such as age, disability, race, religion, or sex.\nWho Is Affected?\nThe Act applies to both developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems:\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n- Developers: Any entity in Colorado that develops or significantly modifies an AI system.\n- Deployers: Any entity in Colorado that uses a high-risk AI system.\nSmall businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees may be exempt from some of these requirements.\nCompliance Obligations\nIf signed into law, starting February 1, 2026, affected businesses must adhere to several stringent requirements:\nFor Developers:\n- Provide extensive information to deployers, including known harmful uses and data summaries.\n- Publish a public statement on their website detailing the types of AI systems developed and their risk management strategies.\n- Disclose all known risks of algorithmic discrimination to the attorney general.\nFor Deployers:\n- Implement and regularly review a comprehensive risk management policy.\n- Conduct impact assessments of AI systems annually and within 90 days of significant modifications.\n- Notify consumers when a high-risk AI system will be used to make consequential decisions, including detailed disclosures on their website.\n- Ensure consumers are aware they are interacting with an AI system unless it is obvious to a reasonable person.\nGeneral Requirements:\n- Both developers and deployers must use reasonable care to avoid algorithmic discrimination, with a rebuttable presumption of compliance if they follow the rules.\n- Deployers must notify the attorney general of any discriminatory outcomes detected by their AI systems.\n- Developers must inform the attorney general and all known deployers of any new risks of discrimination discovered.\nConsumer Rights and Notifications\nThe Act mandates that businesses using high-risk AI systems provide detailed notices to individuals affected by these systems, including:\n- The purpose and nature of the AI system.\n- The type of decision being influenced by the AI.\n- The right to opt out of profiling in decisions with significant legal effects.\n- Contact information and details on how to access the public statement on AI use.\nEnforcement\nThe Colorado attorney general will have exclusive authority to enforce SB205, treating violations as unfair and deceptive trade practices. There is no private right of action under this law, but businesses can assert an affirmative defense if they discover and cure violations through feedback or internal review processes.\nParting Thoughts\nEmployers in Colorado must prepare for the significant compliance burdens imposed by SB205, which will likely lead to broader scrutiny and regulation of AI systems nationwide. Companies must develop robust AI risk management programs, conduct regular impact assessments, and provide transparent disclosures to comply with this landmark legislation. Employers outside Colorado should also be alert, as similar laws are being considered in other states, signaling a nationwide trend toward stricter AI regulations."

  "argos_summary": "Colorado's Artificial Intelligence Act, set to take effect in February 2026, is undergoing legislative reconsideration with two competing proposals. One bill aims to narrow employer obligations and delay enforcement, while the other seeks to enhance transparency and impose joint liability for AI-related decisions in employment. Both proposals highlight the ongoing debate over AI accountability and the need for employers to prepare for compliance, regardless of the final outcome.",
