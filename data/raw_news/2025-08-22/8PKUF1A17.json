  "title": "No Longer A Man's World? Why Gen Z Men Have Higher Unemployment Rates Than Their Female Counterparts",
  "description": "",
  "content": "Gen Z's entrance into the job market hasn't been easy. Between an economic slowdown, the disappearance of entry-level jobs thanks to AI, and government policy changes that have affected the number of available positions in sectors like public health and nonprofits, there are fewer and fewer opportunities to get a foot in the door.\n\nHowever, recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows that not all new grads are struggling at the same rate. Gen Z men are facing higher levels of unemployment than their female counterparts.\n\nThere may be a number of reasons for this, including the fact that in a few growing corners of the job market, women have long been the more dominant force, Business Insider says.\n\u2022 The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\u2022 Bezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n\nEarlier this month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that just 73,000 new jobs had been added in July. The monthly totals for May and June were also revised down by a combined 258,000 new positions.\n\nAccording to data gathered by the agency, a few of the sectors that have been seeing growth over the last six months include healthcare, hospitality, and education. Traditionally, these fields attract more women than men.\n\nElise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, told Business Insider that while the trend isn't new\u2013 young men have historically had a higher unemployment rate than young women\u2013 the gap is widening.\n\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\n\u201cEmployers are holding steady with the workers they have, and workers are also holding steady in their roles. That can make it harder for new labor market entrants to come in,\u201d she said. \"It could be tougher for men who are looking for jobs where there\u2019s just not a whole lot of hiring right now.\u201d\n\nThe flip side of the trend is that industries that primarily employ women tend to have lower pay. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that median entry-level pay for nursing, a female-dominated industry, is just $65,000, while in computer science, a male-dominated industry, median entry-level pay sits at about $80,000.\n\n\u201cIf you can do something about or improve working conditions and pay and benefits in sectors that may have been traditionally female-dominated, then you may attract more men into those occupations,\u201d Gould told Business Insider. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s rocket science that we have undervalued some of the work that we have historically done.\u201d\n\u2022 Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years \u2014 This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\u2022 In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage \u2014 Learn More",

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nYou see a shocking number of ads daily \u2013 researchers estimate between 6,000 and 10,000 and 375 to 625 per waking hour. In the modern age, most of them come from social media apps whose entire business model revolves around constantly showing you ads and keeping 100% of the revenue. But what if users got a share? That company might just grow its revenue by 32,481% in three years, help users earn and save $325 million and be named Deloitte's fastest-growing software company in North America. That\u2019s what Mode Mobile did. You can still get in for just $0.30 per share.\nReaching Financial Stability One Tap at a Time\nMost Americans can\u2019t afford a $1,000 emergency bill. That means many are one car breakdown or ER visit away from serious financial trouble. There's no quick fix to such a big financial challenge that over 50% of Americans face. However, it's safe to bet that the masses will flock to any good solutions. Mode Mobile created one such solution years ago by allowing people to earn money doing what they already spend a third of their waking hours on \u2013 tapping, scrolling and looking at their smartphone screens.\nMode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. However, users can earn income on their existing devices as well. This extreme competitiveness has allowed Mode Mobile to attract over 50 million registered beta users. Launching the finalized version could bring in millions more, helping the company reach its goal of $150 million in annual revenue within three years.\n6,955,000,000 Users to Go\nCurrently, seven billion smartphones worldwide provide functionality or entertainment but take all the profits. Mode Mobile\u2019s disruption offers the same benefits but allows users to earn money at a time when the prices of goods are skyrocketing. Just like Airbnb lets users earn extra cash by renting out their bedrooms and Uber allows users to make money on their rides back home from work, Mode Mobile wants to enable its users to make money from their phones. However, its total addressable market is much larger than Airbnb\u2019s and Uber\u2019s \u2013 currently at over $1 trillion.\nYou can invest in Mode Mobile at $0.30 per share with a minimum investment of $4,950. Plus, the company is offering the chance to earn up to 120% in bonus shares, if you invest more. All funding rounds open to non-accredited investors, including Mode Mobile\u2019s, are limited in time. So, if you\u2019d like to be part of the future it's building, consider acting soon.\nDisclaimer:\nAN OFFERING STATEMENT REGARDING THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SEC. THE SEC HAS QUALIFIED THAT OFFERING STATEMENT, WHICH ONLY MEANS THAT THE COMPANY MAY MAKE SALES OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED BY THE OFFERING STATEMENT. THE OFFERING CIRCULAR THAT IS PART OF THAT OFFERING STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE HERE.\nMode Mobile recently received their ticker reservation with Nasdaq ($MODE), indicating an intent to IPO in the next 24 months. An intent to IPO is no guarantee that an actual IPO will occur.\nThe Deloitte rankings are based on submitted applications and public company database research, with winners selected based on their fiscal-year revenue growth percentage over a three-year period.\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

The unemployment rate averaged 5.3 percent, in line with the first quarter, and the underemployment rate held steady at just over 41 percent.\nThis web feature tracks employment data for recent college graduates across the United States since 1990, allowing for a historical perspective on the experience of those moving into the labor market.\nThe interactive charts allow users to:\nA table tracks outcomes by college major with the latest available annual data.\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, The Labor Market for Recent College Graduates, https://nyfed.org/collegelabor.\nThe data do not represent official estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, its President, the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nThe framework for this analysis is described in \u201cUnderemployment in the Early Careers of College Graduates following the Great Recession\u201d (NBER Studies in Income and Wealth) and \u201cAre Recent College Graduates Finding Good Jobs?,\u201d a 2014 article in the New York Fed\u2019s Current Issues in Economics and Finance series. These papers examine more than two decades of data on the employment outcomes of recent college graduates across the United States, and contain more details and historical perspective.\nThis web feature makes some of the data featured in these papers available on a timely and updated basis. New unemployment and underemployment data for recent college graduates post on a quarterly basis (typically in February, May, August, and November), and wages and outcome data for college graduates are released on an annual basis (typically in February). Data extend from 1990 to the present. Periodic analyses of these data are published on the Liberty Street Economics blog.\nThe definition of underemployment is based on the kinds of jobs held by college graduates. A college graduate working in a job that typically does not require a college degree is considered underemployed. This analysis uses survey data from the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Information Network (O*NET) Education and Training Questionnaire to help determine whether a bachelor\u2019s degree is required to perform a job. The articles cited above describe the approach in detail.\nSome additional research that utilizes these data include \u201cWorking as a Barista After College Is Not as Common as You Might Think\u201d (Liberty Street Economics).\nThe underemployment figures are calculated as a percentage holding a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, so they do include those with graduate and professional degrees. See the notes below the x-axis on the Underemployment chart for more detail.\nThe \u201cShare with Graduate Degree\u201d column in the table represents, for each college major, the percentage of workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree that also possesses a graduate degree of any kind. For example, 50.2 percent of those with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history also possess some kind of graduate degree, based on February 2022 data.\nAll data presented here are national measures.\nNo. Data span from 1990 to the present.\nNo, the \u201coutcomes by major\u201d data encompass only the most recent year period available to utilize from the American Community Survey, which serves as the source for this analysis.\nThere is no data by gender available in this web feature, but \u201cUnderemployment in the Early Careers of College Graduates following the Great Recession\u201d includes some gender analysis.\nUnfortunately, at this time, this analysis only pertains to those with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nNo. Through 2023:Q2, this analysis examined the types of jobs held by those who are underemployed, categorizing jobs broadly by skill level and pay to generate time series data for the percentages of graduates holding \u201cgood non-college jobs\u201d and \u201clow-wage jobs.\u201d Starting with the 2023:Q3 update, the web feature will no longer include the data series for \"underemployed job types,\" although historical data remain available for download.\nEarly career graduates are those aged 22 to 27, and mid-career graduates are those aged 35 to 45."

When they looked at other real estate investment platforms at the time, they found those companies would often brag to those investors about 4% annual returns on billions of dollars.\nAs Alex says on mogul\u2019s website, \u201cIf we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit immediately.\u201d\nTo date, properties in mogul\u2019s portfolio have generated an average 10-12% annual cash-on-cash yield that hit users\u2019 accounts as rent dividends each month. When long-term appreciation is included, historical performance rises to an 18.8% annualized returns, giving investors both regular income and capital growth\nPart of their success is due to the fact that mogul mogul approves fewer than one percent of properties reviewed. Each candidate asset must clear a 12% bear case hurdle rate before moving to the next level of diligence.\nYou can browse eligible properties on mogul\u2019s website and buy part or all of a house in under 30 seconds, or use the same data and tools available to top real estate firms to underwrite any property across the U.S.\nRent collections are aggregated and distributed to investors every month.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nAmerica has a debt problem, and recent policy is making it worse. President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d is expected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and economists project that the debt-to-GDP ratio will go from 100% to 120% in the same timespan.\nAs a result, corporations and consumers will be stuck with high interest rates until something changes.\nThat change might just come from artificial intelligence, one company argues.\nRange is an AI-powered wealth management platform for high earners that centralizes investments, taxes, estate plans, and more in one account. The platform uses advanced AI technology to deliver personalized financial guidance at fees 75-90% lower than traditional advisors, making expert wealth management more accessible. Today, Range serves nearly 2,000 clients managing over $6 billion in assets.\nTaresh Batra, Range\u2019s vice president of Investments, says these AI-driven productivity gains could be the key to accelerating GDP growth while bringing inflation and interest rates down. \u201cHigher growth and lower interest rates as a result of AI could be a panacea for the markets,\u201d Batra says.\nProductivity is Key\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office uses the following formula to measure and forecast the country\u2019s GDP, or Gross Domestic Product:\nReal GDP Growth = Labor Growth(x labor contribution) + Capital Growth(x capital contribution) + Productivity\n\u201cOf these variables, changes in productivity have the largest impact on GDP growth,\u201d Batra says. \u201cTechnological innovation has been the driver of productivity over the course of history.\u201d\nAI, Batra argues, has the potential to improve productivity and benefit the economy in the coming years, similarly to how the dot-com boom did in the mid-1990s.\nHere\u2019s how:\n- Direct Economic Growth: With AI, companies and workers can be more productive without requiring additional resources.\n- More Jobs, Not Less: While AI may automate certain tasks, history shows that technology creates more jobs than it replaces. In fact, 60% of today\u2019s jobs didn\u2019t exist in 1940. The World Economic Forum projects AI will generate a net gain of 78 million new jobs this decade alone. Range itself exemplifies this trend by employing CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs who collaborate closely with AI engineers to build smarter financial tools.\n- Increased Tax Revenues: \u201cHigher productivity usually leads to higher corporate profits, wages, and economic activity\u2014all of which generate increased tax receipts,\u201d Batra says. \u201cMore government revenue means less need to borrow.\u201d\n- Disinflationary Pressure: \u201cLess government borrowing leads to lower inflationary pressure,\u201d Batra says. \u201cIn addition, productivity improvements reduce the cost of producing goods and services, which slows down inflation.\u201d\n- Improved Debt Dynamics & Lower Rates: Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates, which helps stimulate the economy and allows the government to spend less on interest expense and spend more money on the private sector.\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re already seeing measurable productivity gains in industries that have integrated AI tools into their workflow. Even if policymakers fail to rein in spending in the coming years, AI-driven productivity gains in the private sector may allow us to \u201cgrow our way\u201d out of fiscal distress.\n\u201cIf AI delivers even modest incremental productivity gains of 1-1.5% annually, the US could potentially maintain or reduce current debt-to-GDP levels despite continued spending growth,\u201d Batra says.\nAI Is Transforming, Not Destroying the Job Market\nYes, the rise of AI has resulted in people losing their jobs. This, however, is not a new phenomenon.\nTake farming, for example. Around 70% of people were employed in agriculture in the early 1800s, but that number is now less than 2% thanks to the creation of farming machines and other advancements.\nAt the same time, technological innovations not only created new jobs to replace the ones lost. They added new roles that previously never existed.\n\u201cRemarkably, 60% of the jobs people are employed in today didn't exist in 1940,\u201d Batra says. \u201cThat means nearly 90% of employment growth over the last 80 years resulted from technology creating entirely new categories of work.\u201d\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report estimates that AI and related technologies will create a net gain of 78 million new roles this decade.\nRange is living proof of this. They\u2019ve hired CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs as critical subject matter experts to help their AI engineers build and validate their platform.\n\u201cThese aren't traditional roles\u2014they represent the emergence of new types of knowledge workers who combine domain expertise with technological fluency,\u201d Batra says.\nHow You Could Bring the Power of AI Into Your Wealth Management With Range\nIn just four short years, Range has signed up almost 2,000 high income members and advises them on more than $6 billion in assets.\nCurrently in beta, Range\u2019s proprietary AI engine is capable of delivering financial insights and guidance in seconds, potentially allowing you to capitalize on opportunities and avoid any potential pitfalls \u2014 for example, if you should buy an investment property or if you can retire early based on your complete financial picture\nRange also operates on a flat-fee pricing model and offers portfolio management with 0% Assets Under Management fees, so you won\u2019t pay more as your net worth continues to grow.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com. Reserving the ticker symbol is not a guarantee that the company will go public.

      "text": "Jacqueline Kline was a proud overachiever in college. She enrolled in a packed class schedule, attended campus networking events, landed an impressive slate of internships, and graduated cum laude from Florida State University.\nThen, after her 2023 graduation celebrations wound down, Kline found herself back in her childhood bedroom. Over the next year, she applied to hundreds of communications and media jobs between babysitting shifts. The responses were deflating: Some companies sent quick rejections, others turned her away after a couple of interviews, but most simply ghosted her.\n\"I graduated, but I didn't feel successful,\" the now 24-year-old told me. \"I had this degree \u2014 and that's a privilege, not everyone has that opportunity \u2014 but it didn't matter. My GPA didn't matter. None of it mattered if I didn't have a job.\"\nIt's a tough time to look for work. For 20-somethings, breaking into the market is particularly daunting. Companies and consumers are bracing for an economic slowdown, and employees are hesitant to leave their current gigs. Federal policy uncertainty is spooking businesses, and white-collar industries are not the safe career bets they used to be.\nThe tried-and-true ways that young people used to climb the economic ladder are disappearing, and AI is threatening to replace entry-level work in enviable fields like tech. President Donald Trump's cost-cutting efforts have wiped out jobs in government agencies, nonprofits, and public health. Law school applications are ballooning beyond what the industry can sustain, and humanitarian routes like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps are among the White House DOGE office's latest targets. It all leaves young people \u2014 even those who spent their teen and university years positioning themselves for the future \u2014 barreling toward a career cliff.\nSo, what's an ambitious Gen Zer to do?\nKline is finishing her second year of graduate school at FSU. She said she gave up looking for full-time work because \"the burnout was definitely real\" and decided to take out student loans to pursue her master's. Many of her friends are also facing tough decisions: Commit to a tall stack of job applications, go back to get another degree, or settle for a role outside their chosen field. Each option feels risky.\nYoung adulthood has long been a weird phase of life: Grads often navigate new cities, new relationships, new jobs, and tenuous financial independence. (I write this as a recent college graduate in my 20s.) Still, the combination of a tough job market and emerging technologies means today's graduates face an increasingly bleak set of circumstances.\nAs Richard Mansfield, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, put it, Gen Z has \"a whole lot of clouds on the horizon.\" Based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's analysis of census data, 41.2% of graduates in their early and mid-20s were underemployed in March, meaning they were working jobs that don't typically require a bachelor's degree. That's up from 38.9% in December. And Ivy alums aren't immune: In January, The Wall Street Journal reported that job placement at more than a dozen top MBA programs was the worst \"in recent memory\" last year. Notably, Harvard told the Journal that 23% of its job-seeking MBAs who graduated in spring 2024 were still looking for work three months after leaving campus, a figure that was up from 20% in the prior year and more than double what it was in 2022. Higher education may be known for its historical role as a path to prestige and higher pay, but Gen Zers are wondering whether it's worth it anymore.\nBella Babbitt, 21, graduated a year early from a private New York liberal arts school with a dual degree in business and sociology in 2024. She hoped her internships and the fact that she completed her bachelor's in just three years would help her to land a role in media strategy and to eventually start her own business. She spent a year applying to hundreds of roles without luck while taking on odd jobs to make money, such as waiting tables and delivering food. More recently, she's worked at a marketing firm owned by a family friend. She \"truly believes\" the reason she's employed is because of that personal connection.\n\"I was applying and I felt like, 'This is so stupid because I know I'm going to get rejected,'\" she said, adding, \"My parents have such a different mindset, where they can't comprehend how we've applied to all these jobs and we're not getting anything.\"\nHistorically reliable prestige jobs are facing challenges, too. In tech, hopeful grads are being boxed out of entry-level positions not only by AI, but also by hiring freezes. In law, US firms' hiring of entry-level summer associates is hitting a historic low. Even \"stopgap\" roles that were stepping stones to bigger things are evaporating: From the start of 2023 to the start of 2025, internship postings on the college job-search platform Handshake declined by over 15%. When Gen Zers are ready to take the leap into a larger role, they're finding themselves stuck \u2014 young people can't fill desks because older generations are delaying plans to quit and retire, leaving new grads on the lower rung of the career ladder for longer.\nIt's leaving Abbey Owens discouraged. She graduated summa cum laude last month from a liberal arts college with a record of marketing internships, good grades, and a slew of unanswered applications. After months on the job hunt, the 21-year-old said she's thinking about bartending and losing hope of finding a role in her field: \"I'll accept almost anything,\" she told me.\nBabbitt and Owens describe the pain of continuous rejection \u2014 a stream of \"no's\" that drags on for months or years, application after application. Their experience is a symptom of a landscape with a dwindling number of job postings and lower hiring rates. One in five job seekers is considered long-term unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, meaning they've been out of work for 27 weeks or longer.\nEven Gen Zers who are trying to follow their passions into less pressure-packed jobs than finance and tech are facing tough times. Young people dedicated to public service or academia, where there is an implicit exchange of stability in place of bigger salaries, are staring at an uncertain road.\nA 21-year-old University of Maryland student (who asked not to be named for fear of career retaliation) told me they'd lost two roles because of federal government cuts. This spring, they were interning at the Transportation Security Administration before being let go after DOGE prompted cuts of the agency's remote work contracts. Their summer internship \u2014 a coveted role at an intelligence agency \u2014 was canceled the following week.\n\"I think it's just important for people to know how shocking all of this is,\" they said, adding, \"There's a whole new wave of talented young individuals who are excited about public service who are being denied opportunities and thrown to the dirt.\"\nNow, without a summer job, they're likely to stay in their hometown and scoop ice cream or take shifts at a coffee shop, they said. They have two years left at Maryland, and they're rethinking their dream of working in government.\nOther public sector options aren't promising, either. As part of DOGE's work, federal agencies are under a hiring freeze, AmeriCorps is pausing programs, the Peace Corps is cutting staff, and federally funded roles at nonprofits, science labs, and public health centers are vanishing.\nAmid the rising sense of doom, Mansfield cautions that the Zoomer labor market outlook is complicated \u2014 and economists don't yet have a full picture. Hard indicators show the economy is relatively healthy on paper: The US added a higher-than-expected number of jobs in May, inflation is getting under control, and the unemployment rate is low. Mansfield said that \"the data hasn't caught up yet\" to reflect the loss of entry-level opportunities that many new grads are experiencing.\n\"It's not as if we're running out of useful things for young, educated people to do,\" he said. \"It's just that we're undermining our mechanisms for getting them there.\"\nWhile Gen Z might seem headed toward a careerpocalypse, economists and labor market analysts told me the cruelest part was that this instability wasn't inevitable. Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said Gen Zers were almost set up for success. Gould's analysis of labor market data from May indicates that even after adjusting for inflation, 16- to 24-year-old workers experienced historically strong wage growth of 9.1% from February 2020 to March of this year, a figure that exceeded wage growth for workers 25 and older (5.4%). The cohort was set to have lower average unemployment rates and better job opportunities than every other set of young workers since the 1990s. But the rosy picture has rapidly worsened. Job prospects for 22- to 27-year-olds with a bachelor's degree or higher \"deteriorated noticeably\" in the first quarter of this year, per the New York Fed, and the recent-grad gap \u2014 the difference between the overall unemployment rate and the unemployment rate for people who recently graduated from college \u2014 just hit its widest point in at least 40 years.\nIt's worth noting that previous generations have faced tough labor markets: Some baby boomers launched their careers in the middle of the 1970s stagflation, and millennials were looking for jobs in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But Gen Zers are seeing the start of a troubling trend. Educated Zoomers, specifically, are now more unemployed than the rest of America, something that didn't happen early in the pandemic, during the Great Recession, or in the midst of the dot-com crash.\n\"When the overall unemployment rate goes up a little bit more, I don't think people always understand that that is what happens: the 'last hired, first fired' phenomenon,\" Gould said, adding: \"What are you going to do at that point? You've gone into debt going to school, you've already decided your major, you've already made all those investments. It's very hard to shift.\"\nThe economists I spoke with emphasized that there were solutions to the Gen Z career cliff, but things may get worse before they get better. Mansfield said some sectors, like caregiving and healthcare, could see increased labor demand as baby boomers and Gen Xers grow older \u2014 even if those opportunities aren't as attractive to people trained to do something else, like law or finance. He added that as AI becomes more integrated into the economy, Gen Zers and later generations will most likely start to find roles in careers that don't exist yet.\nKline, the recent Florida State grad, is banking on some sort of turnaround. Even as opportunities for people with advanced degrees dry up, she thinks the master's and some more internships will make her resum\u00e9 that much more attractive to prospective employers.\n\"I'm reminding myself that it will be worth it, taking all these loans will be worth it, because having this master's degree will get me further and give me a better chance at a job opportunity,\" Kline said, adding. \"Before I came back to school, that was one of the loneliest times of my life.\"\nMarket conditions are changing how ambitious Gen Zers see themselves and their work. It isn't just about whether they can land a job after graduation. A lot of people my age feel that open doors older generations took for granted \u2014 having access to homeownership and retirement, affording kids or healthcare or further education \u2014 are being locked alongside our career paths. It's part of why young people are becoming less loyal to the grind, or giving up on traditionally white collar careers altogether.\nIt's also why Isabella Clemmens, 22, is betting on herself. After graduating from Oregon State in May, she's moving to Austin to try out a new city, meet friends, attend concerts, and try living on her own. When Clemmens and I spoke a few weeks ago, she was planning to work in retail until her growing stack of applications landed her a branding or graphic design role. After four years of hard work, she hadn't expected her job hunt to be so challenging. To kick off postgrad life in Texas, though, she would have to make concessions.\n\"My dream job might exist,\" she told me. \"But I'm one of 400 people applying for it.\"\nAllie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nCollect passive income from real estate without taking on the headaches of being a landlord. You can now take advantage of the higher-for-longer interest rate environment by investing in a portfolio of private real estate debt with as little as $100.\nThe explosion of private credit returns is unlikely to last forever, but currently, it\u2019s one of the hottest asset classes out there. In 2020, its total value stood at $1.04 trillion. Just three years later, it grew by a staggering 55% to reach $1.61 trillion. BlackRock expects it to climb up to $3.5 trillion by 2028. The IMF has recognized its spectacular returns in recent years. Bezos\u2019 darling real estate platform, which has completely disrupted the industry, now targets 7%-9% in annual cash dividends through private debt investing.\nPrivate Debt for All\nArrived has become a household investment platform that knows how to deliver passive investments. It has generated $5.6 million for its investors in dividends alone, and its user base continues to grow throughout market fluctuations. The company now boasts 614,000 registered investors who routinely snap up the shares of its carefully vetted offerings. Over the years, it has developed deep knowledge about what makes real estate markets tick. Now, using that knowledge to deliver 7%-9% for investors looking to diversify into real estate private debt through the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\nThis type of corporate credit offers relatively higher profits at lower risk as it's backed by real estate. If things go south, investors may be able to recoup their losses, depending on their position. Arrived uses a tried and tested fund mechanism to deliver passive income to the investors. It pools the funds and uses them to finance specific real estate projects that pay out monthly interest. It\u2019s targeting 7% to 9% returns after all fees and expenses. To achieve this goal across its loans, it approaches individual loans with the same scrutiny level as the homes.\nArrived's Q3 2024 report underscores the broader success of its investment strategy. During the quarter, investors earned over $1.54 million in dividend income, marking a 25% increase from Q2 2024. Across 354 individual properties, single-family residential investments averaged 3.7% annualized dividends, while vacation rentals provided an average return of 2.8%. These consistent results demonstrate the platform's ability to balance income and appreciation across its portfolio.\nLIMITED TIME FOR JUST $100\nThe Byers House\nOwn a piece of the Byers House, a vacation rental located at the iconic home of Joyce, Jonathan, and Will Byers, featured in Stranger Things and located in Fayetteville, GA, just 20 minutes from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. This property was used to film the exterior scenes in the actual show and influenced the design for the interior sets, which were filmed in a nearby studio.\nDebt Acquisition Tactics\nArrived partners only with experienced professionals with a history of successful real estate projects and a spotless financial record. Sticking to this criterion mitigates the risk of delays, cost overruns, and other unpredictable problems that may arise.\nAdditionally, the platform only considers residential properties in the first loan position, which creates a thick protection barrier in the event of a downside. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, Arrived and its investors would be the first to get their investment back.\nLocation also plays an important factor. Just like with its fractional share offerings, Arrived uses a combination of data science and human expertise to pinpoint the most promising deals that come its way.\nA Way In\nPrivate credit was reserved only for high-net-worth individuals who could afford the astronomical investment minimums and fees. But with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, any investor, accredited or non-accredited, can acquire a stake in the fund with as little as $100 and receive monthly dividends.\nClick here to invest in the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\nCheck out the latest offerings on Arrived\nDiversify your portfolio with a mix of debt and equity real estate investments through Arrived's multiple offerings.\nHold on!\nInvestors are seeing outstanding returns through curated real estate investment alerts.

      "text": "- Gen Z men face higher unemployment rates than women in the current job market.\n- Traditional career paths are vanishing, and AI disrupts entry-level job opportunities.\n- Gen Z women excel in healthcare, a growing sector, while men lag in tech and business.\nIt's harder to be a man in finance lately, let alone a tech bro.\nZoomers have had a rocky debut on the job market. Traditional paths to success in fields like tech, law, and government are disappearing, and AI is disrupting the entry-level rung of the career ladder. Zoomers are questioning the ROI of a college education and increasingly pivoting toward blue-collar work. The overall labor market also took a dive in July, indicating that companies have less demand for workers and fewer Americans are participating in the labor market.\nBut not all 20-something job seekers are struggling at the same rate: Gen Z men appear to be speeding toward a career cliff faster. The cohort has tended to have higher unemployment rates than their female peers since the pandemic, and young women's dominance in the few healthy corners of the market could be a key reason.\n\"Employers are holding steady with the workers they have, and workers are also holding steady in their roles. That can make it harder for new labor market entrants to come in,\" Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said, adding that \"it could be tougher for men who are looking for jobs where there's just not a whole lot of hiring right now.\"\nGen Z women dominate in the growing healthcare sector\nGen Z women tend to have higher job stability, partially because of their dominance in in-demand sectors like healthcare and the nursing field.\nHealthcare is one of few industries showing job growth for the six months ending in July. Hospitality and education \u2014 two of the other fields with growing job numbers \u2014 are also predominantly women. The data comes as the labor market is cooling: the US fell short of the expected 106,000 jobs in July, adding just 73,000 roles with an uptick in employment to 4.2%, and revisions to the previous two months showed that there were more than 250,000 fewer jobs created over that period than previously estimated. Tech and business especially are seeing a hiring slowdown and increased layoffs.\nBLS data shows that the primarily-male information and business sectors \u2014 which often employ jobs like computer scientists, consultants, and analysts \u2014 have had among the lowest employment growth in 2025. They're also some of the entry-level roles that are most impacted by emerging AI and the Great Flattening.\nAbout 9 in 10 licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, and nurse practitioner roles were held by women in 2022, per the most recently available Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis. The number of men entering the profession stalled between 2019 to 2021 after decades of consistent growth. Nursing was among the college majors with the lowest unemployment rate, per a 2023 New York Federal Reserve analysis.\nSemee Lim, 26, spends her days caring for babies and supporting new parents in a Tampa-area newborn intensive care unit. It's a busy job, but Lim said her role is always in demand.\n\"I've been blessed enough to have a pretty smooth experience job hopping,\" said Lim, who moved to Florida after starting her career near her Maryland hometown. \"There's always a nursing shortage.\"\nSince graduating in 2021, Lim said she can remember working with just three male nurses.\nAs Gould explained, this isn't a new trend: young men have long had a higher unemployment rate than young women. But the employment gap between 22-to-27-year-old women and men with bachelor's degrees is widening. The unemployment rate for recent male graduates has risen steeply from less than 5% to 7% over the past 12 months, per a Financial Times analysis of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. For young female graduates, joblessness is largely unchanged over the same period.\nIt's also becoming more common for young women to economically and educationally outpace men. In 1995, one-quarter of both young men and young women held bachelor's degrees, an analysis of population data by the Pew Research Center found. By 2024, 47% of women ages 25 to 34 had one, compared with 37% of men. A Lending Tree analysis of 2021 US Census Bureau data found that single women also owned 2.7 million more homes in America than single men.\nAt the same time, industries with predominantly female workers tend to have lower pay \u2014 even if they have more job stability. It's a challenge that Lim said she thinks about often: \"Nursing doesn't pay as much as I would like it to, but it's definitely such a rewarding job,\" she said. The median entry-level nurse salary was $65,000 annually in 2023, for example, while the median entry-level computer scientist salary was $80,000. It's likely that healthcare jobs will become even more necessary as baby boomers age.\n\"If you can do something about or improve working conditions and pay and benefits in sectors that may have been traditionally female-dominated, then you may attract more men into those occupations,\" Gould said. \"I don't think it's rocket science that we have undervalued some of the work that we have historically done.\"\nAre you a Gen Zer open to sharing your job search experience?
