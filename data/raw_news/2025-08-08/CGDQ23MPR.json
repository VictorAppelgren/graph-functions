  "description": "Everything new to stream this weekend on all your favorite streaming services from Netflix to Apple TV to Hulu and more.",
  "content": "We\u2019re one week into August and there are a bunch of great new shows and movies to discuss. Overall, this has been a pretty great year for TV, with shows like Severance, The Pitt, Andor and many more gracing the small screen. While it\u2019s been pretty lackluster as far as superhero movies go, horror has seen a real comeback in 2025.\n\nThis weekend, we have horror, comedy, action and romance. Prequels, sequels, brand new originals. There\u2019s something for everyone. Let\u2019s dive right in!\n\nIf you have any tips or I missed something, shoot me a message on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. You can check out last weekend\u2019s streaming guide right here. Let\u2019s dive right in!\n\nWednesday is back, though Netflix has (annoyingly, bizarrely) split it into two parts. The first half is excellent, thanks to a stellar cast led by Jenna Ortega in the titular role. Wednesday Addams is joined by her parents, her younger brother, classmates and some new faces including Steve Buscemi\u2019s Principal Dort. You can read all about the new cast in my Season 2 guide.\n\nRead my review of Season 2, Part 1 right here.\n\nThis is on my watchlist for this evening and I hope to have a review out over the weekend. I\u2019m a big fan of the original series, though Outlander has a tendency to annoy me in later seasons and has frankly never been as good since they left Scotland. Thankfully, the prequel will give us lots of Scotland as it explores the story of Jamie Fraser\u2019s parents, played by Harriet Slater and Jamie Roy. The prequel series also tells the story of Claire\u2019s parents, played by Hermione Corfield and Jeremy Irvine. Predictably, neither couple led boring lives. I\u2019m a sucker for historical romances, and I\u2019m also ready for new characters in this universe. Having just been on a two-week trip through Scotland, I\u2019m definitely ready for this.\n\nHoly crap this is a great movie. I\u2019m rarely blown away these days, but Zach Cregger\u2019s Weapons is a bonafide masterpiece. It\u2019s not really a horror movie, though it has horror elements. It\u2019s more of a Brothers Grimm fairy tale set in modern America. It\u2019s creepy, hilarious, clever and tightly paced. It\u2019s just so unique and different, I don\u2019t really know how to categorize it at all. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything. Just trust me on this one and head to the theater ASAP. It\u2019s brilliant.\n\nRead my review of Weapons right here.\n\nAmazon keeps releasing screwball comedies like Deep Cover and Heads Of State. It makes a lot of sense. They\u2019re relatively cheap and they\u2019re crowd-pleasers. The Pickup stars Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson as armored truck drivers who find themselves in a world of trouble. It looks . . . incredibly stupid, and reviews have not been kind. But hey, sometimes a stupid movie is exactly what you need on a warm summer evening.\n\nOh hey, look, another movie with Pedro Pascal! Freaky Tales is an anthology film set in 1987. The logline reads, \u201cAn NBA star, a corrupt cop, a female rap duo, teenage punks, neo-Nazis and a debt collector embark on a collision course in 1987 Oakland, Calif.\u201d Along with Pascal, it stars Angus Cloud (in his last film, RIP) Ben Mendelsohn and many more, including some big cameos. It\u2019s getting pretty solid reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and looks like a lot of fun.\n\nYou know me. Despite all the new stuff, I just can\u2019t resist older shows, especially if they\u2019re cop dramas or British mysteries. Well, C.B. Strike checks all the boxes. I\u2019m so delighted that I started this one, though I find it so compelling that I\u2019ve lost sleep staying up way too late watching. The series is based on the books by J. K. Rowling, under the pen name Robert Galbraith. I know Rowling is a controversial figure, but Galbraith is friend to all and sundry. You never read any negative headlines about Robert Galbraith, pleasant and uncontroversial fellow that he is. In any case, I don\u2019t like to dwell on controversial artists. I prefer to think about their work, and this is a fantastic series. So good, that I fully intend to start reading the novels. The show stars Tom Burke as British private investigator, Cormoran Strike. He\u2019s joined by his assistant Robin Ellacott, played by Holliday Grainger. (And just like that we have an actor with the first name Hermione and an actor with the last name Grainger in the same post!)\n\nOn top of the fantastic mysteries these two excellent and likeable characters solve, there\u2019s a whole \u201cwill they/won\u2019t they\u201d romantic angle that\u2019s really gripping. I guess I\u2019m just a sucker for romance in general. I\u2019m only on Season 2, but so far it\u2019s been absolutely brilliant.\n\nThere are some fantastic shows still airing weekly despite so many having come to an end. We\u2019ll start with my favorite new series.\n\nJason Momoa stars as Ka\u2019iana in his second epic Apple TV+ series, Chief Of War. It\u2019s excellent, epic and incredibly violent. This is not your Moana Hawaii. Temuera Morrison plays a terrific villain as the murderous King Kahekili (if only Boba Fett could have been so diabolical in his own show). Night Agent star Luciane Buchanan also stars. If you enjoyed Game Of Thrones or Shogun, please give this one a watch.\n\nI\u2019m enjoying the hell out of Dexter: Resurrection, though it\u2019s certainly not as good as the earlier seasons of the main show. It\u2019s a nice return to form, nevertheless, and the NYC-set season brings in a lot of fun new characters. Joining Michael C. Hall and some returning characters like Harrison (Jack Alcott) and Angel Batista (David Zayas) we have Uma Thurman, Peter Dinklage, Neil Patrick Harris and Krysten Ritter. It\u2019s quite the buffet!\n\nAfter I believe five episodes of The Institute, I\u2019m afraid to say that I\u2019m giving this one a Thumbs Down. I\u2019ll keep watching and hopefully by the end of the season it can justify its existence, but as it stands this feels rushed, cheap and flat. There\u2019s an interesting premise\u2014psychic powered kids abducted and taken to a mysterious Institute where they\u2019re tested against their will and then used for nefarious means\u2014but the execution is just very mid. The acting is super uneven also. There are some talented character actors in smaller roles, and Ben Barnes is great, but there are a lot of kids in this show and they\u2019re all over the place. Curious what you all think of this one so far.\n\nSadly, Resident Alien was cancelled so Season 4 is the last, but in all honesty\u2014as much as I enjoy it and as great as Alan Tudyk is\u2014this probably should have been a three or four season show tops. I\u2019m enjoying the fourth season, but it\u2019s starting to feel a little thin on story.\n\nSouth Park continues to drop bombs on the Trump administration in its 27th season. The second episode was a lot messier than the first, but we got some hilarious Kristi Noem parody involving her botoxed face and her penchant for shooting puppies\u2014including Krypto from Superman!\u2014and a pretty stellar lambasting of Charlie Kirk and his dishonest debate tactics. Oh, and vice president J.D. Vance was a derpy little person who offered to put baby oil on Satan, Trump\u2019s current boyfriend. I really do love South Park.\n\u2022 Twisted Metal Season 2 (Peacock) \u2014 I haven\u2019t started Season 2 yet, but this is a really solid, fun adaptation of the video game. Give it a shot if you remember you have a Peacock subscription, which I often forget!\n\u2022 Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 3 (Paramount+) \u2014 Everything I\u2019ve heard about Season 3 of Strange New Worlds is pretty negative. It appears the once solid Star Trek series has gone a bit off the rails. I\u2019m too far behind to know.\n\u2022 Foundation Season 3 (Apple TV+) \u2014 I\u2019ve had a number of people tell me it\u2019s high time I started watching Foundation on Apple TV+. If only I had more time and was less inclined to watch old cop shows and British mysteries! I do love a good epic space opera, though. I also need to watch For All Mankind on Apple. I hear that\u2019s excellent.\n\u2022 Nautilus (AMC) \u2014 Based on Jules Verne\u2019s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, Nautilus follows Nemo\u2019s mission to exact revenge on the East India Mercantile Company. I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about this one as well.\n\u2022 Countdown (Prime Video) \u2014 Jensen Ackles from The Boys stars in this race-against-the-clock thriller. I believe we have just one episode to go after this weekend. It didn\u2019t get great reviews but a lot of my readers have said they enjoy it, so it remains on my backlog.\n\u2022 Smoke (Apple TV+) \u2014 Taron Egerton and Dennis Lehane\u2019s arson-mystery-drama wrapped up this week. For whatever reason, this just hasn\u2019t sparked my interest, though a lot of readers say it\u2019s good.\n\u2022 The Gilded Age Season 3 (HBO) \u2014 HBO\u2019s period drama The Gilded Age is still airing weekly. If you enjoy following the stories of well-heeled Americans during the height of the 19th century, this is something you should definitely watch.\n\u2022 The Buccaneers Season 2 (Apple TV+) \u2014 The Buccaneers is another period drama, with all the lovely costumes, set around the same time as The Gilded Age, but across the pond in England. The finale aired this week.\n\u2022 BMF Season 4 (Starz) \u2014 The story of the Black Mafia Family in Detroit is based on a true story, and one of the leads is actually the son of one of the main characters. Two more episodes remain in this 1980s-set drama often referred to as the \u201cBlack Sopranos\u201d.\n\nWhat else did I miss? What should I put on this list or add to my backlog?

      "text": "It\u2019s been nearly three years since Wednesday first debuted on Netflix, becoming one of the streaming service\u2019s biggest hits almost overnight. The first season of the Tim Burton-directed Addams Family spinoff remains Netflix\u2019s third most-watched show of all time, just behind Stranger Things Season 4 and Squid Game Season 1. Wednesday\u2019s first season attracted over 252 million viewers who watched over 1.2 billion minutes of the series.\nThree years is a long time, and fans are excited to dive headfirst into the story of Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) and her fellow Outcasts at the aptly named boarding school, Nevermore. Season 1 wrapped up its mystery in November, 2022. Now Season 2 is poised to return with an all new mystery, and plenty of surprises.\nWhat Time Does Wednesday Season 2 Come To Netflix?\nThe answer to this question is a little complicated. Netflix has been in the habit of releasing seasons of its ongoing shows in chunks, starting with Stranger Things 4, which was released in two parts, and reaching fever pitch with the final season of Cobra Kai, which was released in three installments over the course of nearly an entire year.\nWednesday Season 2 drops its first half at midnight Pacific Time, which translates to 3 am Eastern Time. Only the first four episodes will be available to stream, however, at least for now. That\u2019s still a solid four hours of new content, but viewers will have to wait for Part 2.\nThe next four episodes land on Netflix nearly a month later on September 3rd at midnight PT / 3 am ET. Thankfully, the second season will only release in two parts rather than three. Still, it\u2019s going to be a grueling wait given we can almost guarantee that Part 1 will end on a cliffhanger.\nFor more new shows on Netflix and other streaming services check out my weekend streaming guide.\nWhat Happened In Wednesday\u2019s First Season?\nYou obviously ought to watch Season 1 prior to watching Season 2, but here\u2019s a brief recap:\nIn the first season, Wednesday finds herself enrolled in yet another new school: Nevermore Academy, which is basically Hogwarts for this universe\u2019s magical beings (though not all Outcasts have magical powers, most do). Edgar Allen Poe is the school\u2019s most famous alumni.\nShe quickly finds herself embroiled in a disturbing mystery. Bodies are piling up and her psychic powers start to come in very handy. Our deadpan sleuth leaps down a rabbit hole involving Wednesday\u2019s ancestor Goody Addams and her magical Book Of Shadows, an Outcast-hating pilgrim named Joseph Crackstone, and a murderous, rampaging beast.\nAnd, of course, we got a dance scene for the ages:\nAll of this thrust Ortega, and Wednesday, directly into the spotlight \u2013 a fine place for actors, but less so for loner Outcasts like Wednesday Addams.\nWhat Is Wednesday Season 2 About?\nThe official synopsis for Season 2 reads: \u201cWednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega), returns to prowl the Gothic halls of Nevermore Academy, where fresh foes and woes await. This season, Wednesday must navigate family, friends and old adversaries, propelling her into another year of delightfully dark and kooky mayhem. Armed with her signature razor-sharp wit and deadpan charm, Wednesday is also plunged into a new bone-chilling supernatural mystery.\"\nI\u2019ve actually watched the first four episodes of Wednesday Season 2 so be sure to follow me here on this blog to read my review which goes live when the new season drops. You can also follow me on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky or Facebook. I\u2019ll post a video review to my YouTube channel as well.\nWednesday also has to contend with a new threat. This year, we bring the family to Nevermore,\u201d Tim Burton said of Season 2. \u201cYour family at school is the worst thing possible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d This means we get to spend more time with her parents and she gets to navigate school with her little brother in tow. It also means we get to spend more time with Uncle Fester (Fred Armisen).\n\u201cIn Season 2, you get to spend more time with Fester. You see that he is helpful,\u201d Armisen said. \u201cHe really does put himself in what you would think is harm\u2019s way to help Wednesday. He really makes it his business to help Wednesday out.\u201d\nNo spoilers beyond that except to say that Wednesday finds herself in all kinds of new trouble \u2013 with a little old trouble thrown into the mix. \u201cThreats remain out there \u2026 to both Wednesday and the school,\u201d series creator Mike Millar informs us. \u201cNot all loose ends have been tied up as neatly as she thinks they have.\u201d\nWho Stars In Wednesday Season 2?\nJenna Ortega leads a terrific cast. Newcomers include:\nSteve Buscemi as Principal Dort\nGwendoline Christie\u2019s Principal Weems is no longer with us (RIP) but her replacement is no slouch. Neither is his toupee. Buscemi is best known for his roles in films like Reservoir Dogs and shows like HBO\u2019s Boardwalk Empire. Very little is known about Principal Dort, however. But everyone in Nevermore has secrets. One thing we do know? He\u2019s very, very into the school. \u201cHe wears purple, branded baseball caps, he\u2019s basically Mr. Nevermore,\" Millar says of Principal Dort, \"and the opposite of the late Principal Weems, who was so put-together and chic.\u201d Buscemi is a new series regular.\nJoanna Lumley as Grandmama Hester Frump\nMorticia Addams (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has an icy relationship with her mother, Grandmama Hester. We\u2019ll learn more about why in Season 2. It\u2019s the opposite for Wednesday. \u201cWednesday and Hester get along great,\u201d co-showrunner Alfred Gough says of the incoming character. \u201cOther than Fester, her Grandmama is probably Wednesday\u2019s favorite person and the one she feels the most kinship with.\u201d Lumley is best-known for her BAFTA award-winning role as Patsy in the BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous. She\u2019s a guest star in Wednesday Season 2.\nOther new series regulars include:\n- Billie Piper (Scoop, I Hate Suzie)\n- Evie Templeton (Return to Silent Hill, Lord of Misrule)\n- Owen Painter (Tiny Beautiful Things, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale)\n- Noah B. Taylor (Law & Order: Organized Crime, Park Avenue)\nNew guest stars include:\n- Christopher Lloyd (The Addams Family)\n- Joanna Lumley (Fool Me Once, Absolutely Fabulous)\n- Thandiwe Newton (Westworld, Crash)\n- Frances O\u2019Connor (The Missing, The Twelve)\n- Haley Joel Osment (The Kominsky Method, Somebody I Used to Know)\n- Heather Matarazzo (The Princess Diaries, Scream)\n- Joonas Suatamo (Star Wars: The Force Awakens)\n- Lady Gaga (Gaga: Five Foot Two)\nSome of the cast, like Lady Gaga\u2019s mysterious Rosaline Rotwood, won\u2019t show up until Season 2, Part 2. Christopher Lloyd is the second major cast member from the original Addams Family. He played Uncle Fester. Christina Ricci played Wednesday.\nReturning cast members include Emma Myers as Wednesday\u2019s werewolf roommate, Enid Sinclair; Luis Guzman as Gomez Addams; Isaac Ordonez as Puglsey Addams; Moosa Mostafa as Eugene Ottinger; Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester; Joy Sunday as Bianca Barclay; Victor Dorobantu as Thing; Hunter Doohan as the Hyde, Tyler Galpin and many more.\nSome of the cast remain shrouded in mystery. Will Christina Ricci\u2019s Marilyn Thornhill return for Season 2? We shall see . . . . Others, like Percy Hynes White\u2019s Xavier Thorpe have been written off the show. Still others are . . . well . . . dead. Who will survive a grisly second season?\nWhat Are The Episode Titles For Season 2, Part 1?\nWednesday\u2019s Season 2, Part 1 episodes are filled with woe \u2013 literally. Each episode includes the woeful word in place of another.\nEpisode 1: \u201cHere We Woe Again\u201d\n- Written by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar\n- Directed by Tim Burton\nEpisode 2: \u201cThe Devil You Woe\u201d\n- Written by Matt Lambert\n- Directed by Paco Cabezas\nEpisode 3: \u201cCall of the Woe\u201d\n- Written by Valentina Garza\n- Directed by Paco Cabezas\nEpisode 4: \u201cIf These Woes Could Talk\u201d\n- Written by Lauren Otero\n- Directed by Tim Burton\nWho\u2019s Behind Wednesday Season 2?\nWednesday was created by Miles Millar who co-showruns with Alfred Gough. Tim Burton directs and executive produces the show. Paco Cabezas and Angela Robinson also direct some of the second season\u2019s episodes. Other executive producers include Steve Stark, Andrew Mittman, Meredith Averill, Karen Richards, Gail Berman, Jonathan Glickman, Tommy Harper, Kayla Alpert, and Kevin Miserocchi. MGM Television is the studio behind the show.\nNetflix has already renewed Wednesday for a third season.\nYou can watch the first six rather macabre minutes of Wednesday Season 2 below:\nThe first four episodes of Wednesday go live on Netflix on August 6th at midnight PT / 3am ET. Look for my review."

      "text": "I had no idea what to expect going into Weapons, the latest movie from Barbarian writer/director, Zach Cregger. I\u2019d seen one trailer. I didn\u2019t read anything else about the film. I went in blind, and you should, too. The following review will be spoiler-free outside of the basic premise. Trust me, you should go into this movie without knowing anything past the basics. I don\u2019t even want to spoil too much of my own reaction to this film. I\u2019ll do a follow-up post digging into the specifics in a couple days, here on this blog, so stay tuned.\nThe setup is pretty straightforward. One night, at exactly 2:17 am in the fictional town of Maybrook, seventeen children from the same 3rd grade class all simultaneously leave their homes and vanish. Only one child shows up to school the next day. Their teacher, Justine Gandy (Julia Garner) is immediately suspected of some wrongdoing. Why else would all these kids from the same class simply up and disappear?\nWhat follows is part horror movie, part Brothers Grimm fairytale, part black comedy, with little nods to Stephen King and Roald Dahl, among others. It\u2019s really hard to describe. Even if I littered this review with spoilers, it would be hard to explain why it works so well, and why it feels absolutely singular and unique. I\u2019m so used to formulaic slop, and not just in the horror genre. This felt new. Cregger\u2019s nonlinear, Rashomon-style storytelling helps the various characters and their stories unfold into something truly remarkable.\nIt starts out a bit slow, and at first I worried it was going to be just another horror movie with some jump scares and suspense. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The two-hours and eight-minute runtime flew by, as we were sucked deeper and deeper into the weird, surprisingly hilarious and twisted tale of these missing children and the people searching for them, including Archer (Josh Brolin) the father of one of the missing kids, and school principal, Andrew Marcus (Benedict Wong). The scene stealer, however, the dark horse of this film, was Austin Abrams as homeless drug addict, James \u2013 though he shares some of the best scenes with Alden Ehrenreich\u2019s Paul Morgan, a police officer who has seen better days.\nI really enjoyed Sinners earlier this year (you can read my review here) but no matter how great it was, I couldn\u2019t help shake the sense that it borrowed just a tad too much from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s From Dusk Till Dawn. I don\u2019t think that takes away from how genuinely great the movie was (and honestly, what a year for quality horror!) but it was a nagging thought throughout. Weapons, on the other hand, is something unto itself. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it, despite whatever cultural references are sprinkled throughout.\nThere are many ways you could interpret this film. Is it an allegory for school shootings? On some level, I think so. Is it about the many ways we, as humans, can be weaponized \u2013 our words, are interactions, our bodies, our thoughts? Definitely. But it\u2019s also a modern fairy tale that never gets bogged down in allegory. There is nothing preachy here, no in-your-face political message that takes away from your enjoyment of the film. In the end, it\u2019s just wildly entertaining.\nThere\u2019s so much to unpack here. Look for my follow-up piece here on this blog and on my YouTube channel."

      "text": "I suppose it\u2019s no huge surprise that this weekend is far from the busiest when it comes to new streaming shows and movies. We are smackdab in the middle of summer, after all. Many of the year\u2019s biggest, most hotly-anticipated shows have come and gone. The big summer blockbusters have already released in theaters. A lot of 2025\u2019s remaining shows and movies will release later in the year, when temperatures cool and people are indoors more.\nStill, I\u2019ve found some good stuff for your viewing pleasure on Netflix and elsewhere. Every week I scour the internet for all the best new releases and compile them in your friendly neighborhood streaming guide.\nBig news also: I finished The Shield at last! This amazing police drama has consumed just about every evening for the past couple months. I burned through all seven seasons in one very long binge. It was so good! The finale ranks among my favorite TV show finales of all time. It\u2019s rare to have a show stay this good from start to finish, but The Shield pulled off seven seasons of at least ten episodes per season and I don\u2019t think there was a single bad episode. I lost sleep watching this show and I regret nothing. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t watch it when it first aired.\nBe sure to check out my Netflix July streaming guide to see everything headed to the most popular streaming service this month.\nIf you have any tips or I missed something, shoot me a message on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. You can check out last weekend\u2019s streaming guide right here.\nWhat\u2019s New & Notable This Weekend\nUntamed (Netflix)\nThe traditional period Western isn\u2019t making the comeback a lot of us hoped for, but the new modern Western genre has seen a real comeback thanks to Yellowstone. Netflix has made its fair share of these, and Untamed is the latest. Eric Bana plays a federal agent investigating a woman\u2019s death in the wilderness of Yosemite National Park. The six-episode limited series is out now on Netflix with a decent 81% Rotten Tomatoes score (88% from audiences). Sam Neill also stars.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds \u2014 Season 3 (Paramount+)\nI\u2019m way behind on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and audience and critic reviews for the third season have dipped considerably, which makes me think maybe I\u2019m not missing much. I haven\u2019t ever been a huge Trek fan, but modern iterations of this show have been almost universally disappointing. This show had real potential, so it\u2019s a shame to hear that it\u2019s gone downhill. Still, I really enjoy Captain Pike and his crew so I\u2019ll probably catch up and see for myself.\nBilly Joel: And So It Goes (HBO Max)\nIf you\u2019re a Billy Joel fan, you\u2019ll definitely want to watch this new documentary on HBO Max. (It\u2019s so nice to just type HBO Max now, instead of HBO / Max). I admit, I know next to nothing about the piano-playing singer/songwriter, but I like his music.\nHow To Train Your Dragon (VOD)\nI really hate most live-action remakes of classic animated movies, but I mostly blame Disney for this. Somehow, DreamWorks knocked it out of the park with its very first try. How To Train Your Dragon was a magnificent remake of the animated movie and now you can watch it at home, though you\u2019ll still have to pay for it since it\u2019s not on any streaming services yet. I ordered the 4K Blu-Ray because it deserves the best picture and sound possible.\nEddington (In Theaters)\nSpeaking of modern Westerns, Eddington has one helluva cast: Pedro Pascal, Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Luke Grimes, Austin Butler etc. The film takes place long, long ago in the year of our lord 2020, back during the dark times of COVID-19 and overcharged political tensions. Hereditary / Midsommar director Ari Aster directs. It looks fantastic from the trailer, but the movie isn\u2019t getting the review scores I\u2019d hoped for: 67% pm Rotten Tomatoes, which is still Fresh but only just barely. It\u2019s possible that Aster\u2019s bleak view of humanity is just . . . too bleak, even for movie critics.\nWhat\u2019s Streaming Weekly\nA number of shows have drawn to a close this month. Apple\u2019s Murderbot is over. So is Season 2 of Poker Face on Peacock. HBO\u2019s Duster ended a week ago and was promptly cancelled. But we still have plenty of ongoing series airing weekly to cover. I\u2019m watching a few of these, including the first entry . . .\nDexter: Resurrection (Paramount+)\nWe\u2019re three episodes deep into the return of Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) and so far I\u2019m enjoying Dexter: Resurrection quite a bit, though we\u2019re still a long ways from the glory days of the original show\u2019s first four seasons. We pick up after the events of the New Blood and head to the Big Apple, where both Dexter and his son Harrison are slumming about, doing their thing. Lots of returning characters and some big new names, including Uma Thurman, Peter Dinklage and Krysten Ritter. We have yet to get to the meat of the story, of course, though it looks like things will kick into higher gear next week.\nResident Alien \u2014 Season 4 (SyFy / Peacock)\nAlan Tudyk vs Alan Tudyk. It\u2019s a match made in heaven \u2014 or on an alien planet. Our hilarious lead faces off against himself in Season 4 of Resident Alien as Harry tries to stop an evil shapeshifting Mantis alien (among other threats to Earth and his friends). It\u2019s a delightful show and I highly recommend it to anyone still on the fence. The earlier seasons are on Netflix! New Season 4 episodes air a week earlier on SyFy before landing on Peacock.\nFoundation (Apple TV)\nThe adaptation of Isaac Asimov\u2019s famous science-fiction work is one I\u2019ve still not watched. Mostly, from what I gather from reviews and readers, it\u2019s a bad adaptation but a good series. That\u2019s better than a bad adaptation that\u2019s also a bad series (looking at you, Rings Of Power!) It\u2019s on my list. It\u2019s just a very, very long list.\nThe Institute (MGM+)\nI need to start The Institute now that my evenings of The Shield have come to an end. It actually sounds like a good show to tide us over while we wait for the return of Stranger Things. The series is based on Stephen King\u2019s novel, and follows the kidnapping of a young boy who wakes up in an institute for children with super powers. I\u2019ve heard positive things from readers. The third episode lands on MGM+ this Sunday.\nOther Currently Airing Shows\nNautilus (AMC) \u2014 Based on Jules Verne\u2019s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, Nautilus follows Nemo\u2019s mission to exact revenge on the East India Mercantile Company\nCountdown (Prime Video) \u2014 Another show I need to start now that I\u2019m no longer watching The Shield every night like some absolute junky. I do enjoy a good race-against-the-clock thriller, and while the reviews haven\u2019t been spectacular, I\u2019ve heard from a lot of people that they\u2019re enjoying thi sone.\nSmoke (Apple TV+) \u2014 Taron Egerton stars as an arson investigator who gets drawn into a murder investigation / conspiracy. Mystery author Dennis Lehane is the show\u2019s creator.\nStick (Apple TV+) \u2014 Owen Wilson stars in this golf-themed feel-good dramedy. Light summer character fare to offset all the grim and gritty.\nThe Gilded Age (HBO) \u2014 The lavish HBO period drama will transport you to the \u201cgilded age\u201d of East Coast America in the late 19th century. Still on my backlog, but my do those costumes look lovely.\nThe Buccaneers (Apple TV+) \u2014 The Buccaneers is more Bridgerton than Downton Abbey, but should appeal to fans of period romance of all stripes.\nBMF (Starz) \u2014 A dramatization of the rise of the Black Mafia Family in Detroit and elsewhere in the 1980s and 90s. I\u2019ve heard it called the \u201cBlack Sopranos\u201d so if that sounds like your thing, give it a shot.\nI went to Superman and didn\u2019t like it very much. Read my review here or watch my video review below:\nWhat else did I miss? What should I put on this list or add to my backlog? Let me know on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky or Facebook.\nPrevious Streaming Guides From Yours Truly:\nFollow me on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky or Facebook.

We also have some theatrical releases that I always include, because I\u2019m still a big believer in movie theaters even if streaming is far more convenient.\nAlso be sure to check out my Netflix July streaming guide to see everything headed to the most popular streaming service this month.\nIf you have any tips or I missed something, shoot me a message on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. You can check out last weekend\u2019s streaming guide right here.\nWhat\u2019s New & Notable This Weekend\nHeads Of State (Prime Video)\nThe last time we saw John Cena and Idris Elba together was in James Gunn\u2019s The Suicide Squad and they were definitely a highlight of that movie, always trying to outdo the other. Now they team up as a U.S. President and UK Prime Minister in a buddy comedy about bickering heads of state trying to survive a foreign adversary. It looks very silly but should be fun, lighthearted summer fare.\nThe Old Guard 2 (Netflix)\nCharlize Theron leads her group of immortal fantasy heroes against a new evil menace in this sequel to Netflix\u2019s 2020 action movie. Uma Thurman plays the bad guy. I didn\u2019t get around to watching the first film, but I guess it was popular enough to warrant a sequel. I\u2019ll add it to my never-ending backlog . . . .\nSandman \u2014 Season 2, Volume 1 (Netflix)\nI admit, I tried and failed to get into Netflix\u2019s adaptation of The Sandman when Season 1 dropped so I\u2019ll probably skip Season 2. This is just \u201cVolume 1\u201d of the second and final season of the show. A second part comes out later this year followed by a final episode even later this year. The Neil Gaiman fantasy series is quite popular, even as the author himself faces serious scandal and sexual abuse allegations.\nMr. Robot \u2014 Season 1-4 (Netflix)\nBe sure to watch this phenomenal hacker-thriller now that it\u2019s out on Netflix. I already wrote up a post about this one, so if you want more info check that out. All four seasons are streaming now.\nSinners (HBO Max)\nOne of my favorite movies of 2025, Sinners is now out on HBO Max with a 4K Blu-Ray release later this week. Yes, it\u2019s very derivative of From Dusk Till Dawn, but it\u2019s still excellent and has some genuinely amazing music. Read my review here.\nBatman Ninja vs. Yakuza League (HBO Max)\nIf you like Batman and you like anime, this sequel to 2018\u2019s Batman Ninja pits the Caped Crusader against the Yakuza League, a group of nefarious supervillains that mirror the Justice League. It has pretty solid reviews.\nJurassic World Rebirth (In Theaters)\nI\u2019m going to try to head to this one soon, having skipped the last two Jurassic World movies. Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) seems to have rebooted the series in a good direction, and it looks like a fun suspense action dino-movie even if I still maintain that the only genuinely good film in this franchise is the original Jurassic Park. This time around we follow Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Zora Bennett as she leads a team of skilled operatives into the island research facility for the original Jurassic Park. It\u2019s getting mixed reviews (51% critics and 72% audience on Rotten Tomatoes) but if you\u2019re going to watch a movie like this you might as well do it on a big screen.\nWhat\u2019s Streaming Weekly\nCountdown (Prime Video)\nI\u2019ve heard mixed things about the new Jensen Ackles-led race-against-the-clock thriller on Prime Video. Murder and conspiracy and the threat of mass casualties is usually my cup of tea, but some critics are calling this one a bit boring, which is quite damning if true. I\u2019ve been so utterly addicted to The Shield lately that I\u2019m pretty behind on new shows. I\u2019ll try to give this one a shot soon. Have you watched it? What do you think?\nSmoke (Apple TV+)\nAuthor and showrunner Dennis Lehane once again teams up with Taron Egerton in Apple\u2019s latest mystery/cop drama. This time around Egerton plays an arson investigator who gets caught up in a nefarious plot. Mixed reviews for this one also, though 68% critics / 75% audiences is still fresh.\nResident Alien \u2014 Season 4 (SyFy)\nI\u2019ve started watching the fourth season of Resident Alien and it\u2019s quite delightful to get Alan Tudyk playing two different aliens: Harry and the Mantis. One good(ish) and one an evil human-eating villain. I think the show is overall starting to show its weaknesses as well, with a plot that\u2019s running a little thin and kids that are quickly aging out of their rolls, but overall it\u2019s still good lighthearted fun and Tudyk is great as always.\nStick (Apple TV+)\nI\u2019m still behind on this one, but what I\u2019ve seen of Stick on Apple TV (notice that it, like Smoke, begins with the letter \u201cS\u201d!) is a great vehicle for Owen Wilson\u2019s casual charm. I suppose enjoying golf would probably make me enjoy this more, but I\u2019m saving it for when I\u2019m in the mood for light character dramedy and not, uh, corrupt cops on the mean streets of LA.\nDuster (HBO)\nWe\u2019ve reached the end of HBO\u2019s 1970s muscle car crime drama, Duster. This is the one show that keeps me watching each week at the moment that isn\u2019t called The Shield. Josh Holloway and the rest of the cast are a lot of fun. It takes place in Arizona, so it\u2019s near and dear to my heart. I love the costumes. And the story, while a little thin and goofy at times, has kept my interest start to finish. I haven\u2019t watched the finale yet, but I\u2019m going to once my 4th Of July festivities are over.\nMurderbot (Apple TV+)\nAlexander Skarsgard is a lot of as Murderbot, a rogue service droid on a mission to save a crew of hapless space scientists. The show is decidedly okay, nothing terrific, but also nothing too heavy. Just good fun sci-fi with a sense of humor (that doesn\u2019t always land). The episodes are too short for Apple\u2019s weekly release schedule, but I think it\u2019s worth a watch. Read my review here.\nThe Gilded Age \u2014 Season 3 (HBO Max)\nI\u2019ve never watched The Gilded Age but I do love period dramas and this one is quite popular. If you\u2019re interested in NYC during the late 1800s and want some good character drama, give it a shot.\nThe Buccaneers \u2014 Season 2 (Apple TV+)\nThe Buccaneers takes place in a similar time period, though across the pond in England, and is more geared at romance. Think Bridgerton and you get in the ballpark. This is definitely another entry geared more toward women than men, following the exploits of a group of young American women as they waltz their way through London\u2019s high society.\nOther current shows include the 1980s crime drama BMF on Starz which is in its fourth season; Season 2 of Peacock\u2019s \u201chow-done-it\u201d mystery series Poker Face and more. Let me know what you\u2019re watching!\nWhat else did I miss? What should I put on this list or add to my backlog? Let me know on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky or Facebook.\nPast June Streaming Guides From Yours Truly:\nFurther Reading:\nI have a piece up about the leaked trailer for Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Odyssey, which I have grave concerns about. Also, good news for FROM fans \u2014 Season 4 has begun shooting in Nova Scotia!\nI also made a video about Neil Druckmann\u2019s exit from HBO\u2019s The Last Of Us, which I find quite troubling:\nFollow me on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky or Facebook.

      "text": "July is over and August is just beginning, and with it a whole bevy of new shows and movies to stream on all the myriad streaming services that take our subscription dollars each month. Romance is in the air, along with epic historical dramas, screwball comedies and much more.\nEvery week I scour the internet for all the best new streaming options, and toss in a couple theatrical releases because as convenient as streaming is, I\u2019d really rather not see the end of movie theaters if I can help it.\nIf you have any tips or I missed something, shoot me a message on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. You can check out last weekend\u2019s streaming guide right here. Let\u2019s dive right in!\nWhat\u2019s New & Notable This Weekend\nChief Of War (Apple TV+)\nJason Momoa stars in his second epic Apple TV+ series. Typically when we think about Hawaii we think about beachy vacations or movies like Moana or Lilo & Stitch. Chief Of War is more like a Mel Gibson movie. Think Braveheart or Apocalypto. This is Hawaii meets Game Of Thrones and Momoa is definitely getting his Khal Drogo on. The series, which debuted to strong Rotten Tomatoes scores, was created by Momoa and Thomas Pa'a Sibbett. Momoa plays war chief Ka\u2019iana, a man attempting to unite the islands\u2019 warring clans during the 18th century, as colonial powers set their sights on the South Pacific. This is my \u201cmust watch\u201d show of the weekend. It\u2019s great to see Momoa back in action.\nTwisted Metal \u2014 Season 2 (Peacock)\nI haven\u2019t started Season 2 of Twisted Metal just yet, but it\u2019s one of the better video game adaptations out there. Part of this is because the video game the show is based off of is just about cars fighting each other. It\u2019s wacky, zany good fun. With so little to work with in terms of story, the show is able to do its own thing while still capturing the fun of the game. Speaking of which . . . we need a new Twisted Metal game right about now. What gives?\nMy Oxford Year (Netflix)\nWe pivot hard from violent historical drama to romance with Netflix\u2019s My Oxford Year. The film\u2019s description reads: \u201cWhen Anna (Sofia Carson), an ambitious young American woman, sets out for Oxford University to fulfill a childhood dream, she has her life completely on track until she meets a charming and clever local (Corey Mylchreest) who profoundly alters both of their lives.\u201d This one hasn\u2019t been reviewed much, but from what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s a dud. Still, if you want some cheesy romance drama this weekend, give it a shot.\nCode Of Silence (BritBox)\nI haven\u2019t started Code Of Silence yet, but it looks terrific. Rose Ayling-Ellis plays Alison Brooks, a deaf civilian working in a police canteen who is drawn into the investigation of a dangerous gang thanks to her lip-reading skills. Things go badly when she finds herself romantically involved with one of the criminals, and at odds with the police. The first three episodes are out now on BritBox.\nThe Departed (Netflix)\nIt\u2019s an oldie but a goodie, as they say. Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Departed is one of the best crime thrillers out there (I devoted an entire post urging people to watch it now that it\u2019s on Netflix). It has one hell of a cast also, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga and Alec Baldwin. Definitely put this one on the list.\nWar Of The Worlds (Prime Video)\nI was pleasantly surprised by the 2005 War Of The Worlds starring Tom Cruise and a young Dakota Fanning. Twenty years later, we have a version starring Ice Cube that looks . . . well it doesn\u2019t look good. It only has 5 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and each one is more negative than the last. Peter Martin of ScreenAnarchy sums it up: \u201cHilariously bad, until it becomes risibly ridiculous. ... A 90-minute infomercial for Amazon.\u201d So maybe this is so bad it would be fun to watch and laugh at . . . ?\nFinal Destination: Bloodlines (HBO Max)\nI only saw the very first Final Destination film, which I thought was pretty good. The sequels just looked like cash grabs to me, a way to use the clever \u201ccheating death has consequences\u201d gimmick to just make money rather than tell a good story. But the trailer for Bloodlines was fantastic and the reviews have been solid. Now that it\u2019s out on HBO Max, I plan to watch it soon. If the trailer can make me wince this hard, I\u2019m sure the full movie will be deeply unsettling.\nThe Naked Gun (In Theaters)\nCritics and audiences alike are heaping praise on Liam Neeson\u2019s The Naked Gun, a sequel to Leslie Nielsen\u2019s Police Squad! spinoff, Naked Gun. I admit, I watched all the Naked Gun movies as a kid and found them hilarious and incredibly stupid, and this new entry in the series looks, well, hilarious and incredibly stupid. I rarely go see anything in the theater that isn\u2019t epic or filled with dragons or superheroes, but I\u2019m going to this one this weekend for sure.\nHappy Gilmore 2 (Netflix)\nI was enormously skeptical of Happy Gilmore 2, a sequel I really didn\u2019t think we needed, and last week when I included it in this guide I said as much. Then I watched the movie . . . and thought it was great! You can read my review right here or watch my video review above.\nWhat\u2019s Streaming Weekly\nA bunch of stuff is airing each week including a few shows I\u2019m watching, though only a couple of these are \u201cmust watch\u201d series that I get excited for when each new episode drops. We\u2019ll begin with my current favorite.\nDexter: Resurrection (Paramount+)\nThe newest Dexter series takes place in NYC instead of Miami or a small upstate town in winter. Michael C. Hall\u2019s Dexter Morgan has followed his son to the Big Apple, where he finds himself entangled with a mysterious billionaire played by Peter Dinklage. Dinklage\u2019s character has a penchant for collecting things, including not only serial killer memorabilia, but serial killers themselves, who he invites to dinner parties. He\u2019s up to something and Dexter wants to find out what that is\u2014and maybe take out a few killers what he\u2019s at it. So far, it\u2019s not as good as early Dexter seasons if only because there hasn\u2019t been the same level of suspense and tension, but it\u2019s still a lot of fun.\nThe Institute (MGM+)\nI\u2019m still very much making up my mind about The Institute, a sci-fi thriller based on a Stephen King novel and directed by FROM director Jack Bender. (I\u2019ve also been watching Mr. Mercedes which is based on a Stephen King series and directed by Jack Bender\u2014go figure). I like the premise more than the execution when it comes to The Institute, which feels like it ought to be better than it is, but still has my curiosity piqued.\nResident Alien \u2014 Season 4 (SyFy / Peacock)\nI\u2019m behind on Resident Alien, largely because I forget about Peacock. It\u2019s just not one of my go-to streaming apps. A lot of my non-Netflix, non-Hulu, non-Apple streaming apps are in my Prime Video account, so I see everything I\u2019m watching in one place when it comes to MGM, Paramount+, Starz, BritBox, AMC and so forth. Peacock just sort of falls into a corner and I forget about it. But I do love Alan Tudyk and this is one of those shows I can put on any time and get a good laugh.\nSouth Park \u2014 Season 27 (Paramount+)\nSouth Park dropped a bomb when Season 27 landed on Paramount just days after the show\u2019s creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a 50-episode deal with Paramount and CBS canceled The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. The long-running animated series went right for Trump\u2019s jugular, and boy did it succeed where almost every other attempt has failed. Absolutely brilliant. The show skipped this past week but is coming back swinging this coming Wednesday with another Trump-focused episode, this time tackling ICE. Whatever you think of Trump or whatever your political stance, one thing is always true: We need good political satire. Society cannot function without it.\nOther Currently Airing Shows\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 3 (Paramount+) \u2014 I\u2019m way too far behind on this show to tell you what\u2019s happening, but if you\u2019re looking for probably the best modern Star Trek out there, this is up there. At least it captures the spirit of classic trek.\nFoundation Season 3 (Apple TV) \u2014 Epic space opera is not Apple\u2019s main thing, but that\u2019s Foundation in a nutshell, though I have yet to even watch a single episode. I keep meaning to and then there\u2019s just so many other things to watch!\nNautilus (AMC) \u2014 This one is going up to the top of my list because it just looks like a ton of fun. Based on Jules Verne\u2019s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, Nautilus follows Nemo\u2019s mission to exact revenge on the East India Mercantile Company.\nCountdown (Prime Video) \u2014 A race-against-the-clock thriller filled with conspiracy and action. Fans of Jensen Ackles from The Boys will want to give this one a shot. I keep meaning to start this and then getting sidetracked. This week, it was because I realized I hadn\u2019t finished the last arc of Hannibal so I watched that instead. I know, I\u2019m a decade late.\nSmoke (Apple TV+) \u2014 Taron Egerton stars as an arson investigator who gets drawn into a murder investigation / conspiracy. Mystery author Dennis Lehane is the show\u2019s creator. We have just one episode to go on this one.\nThe Gilded Age Season 3 (HBO) \u2014 The lavish HBO period drama will transport you to the \u201cgilded age\u201d of East Coast America in the late 19th century. Still on my backlog, but my do those costumes look lovely.\nThe Buccaneers Season 2 (Apple TV+) \u2014 The Buccaneers is more Bridgerton than Downton Abbey, but should appeal to fans of period romance of all stripes.\nBMF Season 4 (Starz) \u2014 A dramatization of the rise of the Black Mafia Family in Detroit and elsewhere in the 1980s and 90s. I\u2019ve heard it called the \u201cBlack Sopranos\u201d so if that sounds like your thing, give it a shot. The season finale is up next.\nWhat else did I miss? What should I put on this list or add to my backlog? Let me know on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky or Facebook.\nPrevious Streaming Guides From Yours Truly:\nSubscribe to my YouTube channel and follow me here on this blog.

      "text": "After a nearly three-year wait, Wednesday is back. The Addams Family spinoff returns with the first four episodes of its second season today, and I\u2019m pleased to report that it\u2019s every bit as good as Season 1.\nJenna Ortega returns as Wednesday Addams, though instead of a newcomer to Nevermore Academy, she\u2019s now the center of attention, something of the returning hero with fans \u2013 and stalkers \u2013 harrying her every movement. Predictably, she hates this far more than being just another oddity in a school of Outcasts.\nAddams Family Values\nThe story picks up after the events of Season 1. Summer break has just ended and Wednesday returns, this time with her younger brother, Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez) in tow. As if this wasn\u2019t burden enough, her parents decide to stick around as well. The new Nevermore Academy administrator, Principal Dort (Steve Buscemi) asks Morticia Addams (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to help spearhead the school fundraising gala, so she and Gomez (Luis Guizman) remain on campus, much to Wednesday\u2019s dismay.\nThis gives all these characters a lot more time in the spotlight. We also get more time with Wednesday\u2019s beloved Uncle Fester (Fred Armisen) and meet her second-favorite relative, Grandmama Hester (Joanna Lumley) who Wednesday adores almost as much as Morticia despises.\nRead all about the new and returning cast for Wednesday Season 2 here.\nNew Mysteries To Solve\nIn the first season, Wednesday used her special psychic powers and keen intellect to solve a string of murders. We learned that Tyler (Hunter Doohan) was actually a monstrous Hyde being groomed and controlled by Christina Ricci\u2019s Marilyn Thornhill. Now, Tyler has been locked up in the Willow Hill Psychiatric Hospital, run by newcomer Rachael Fairburn (Thandiwe Newton). This new location looms large in Season 2, taking on almost as important a role as Nevermore Academy itself.\nWednesday\u2019s return to school, after a busy summer spent hunting a serial killer, corresponds eerily with a new spate of murders. Wednesday also learns she has a stalker, though whether the two mysteries are connected is unclear.\nThe first four episodes of Season 2 deal largely with Wednesday trying to solve these puzzles, though when she\u2019s cut off from her psychic powers her sleuthing abilities take a major hit. It\u2019s the classic \u201cde-power\u201d trope we\u2019ve seen in other shows like Stranger Things, but used to greater effect. Each episode is roughly an hour long, and is stuffed with entertaining shenanigans. A trip to an overnight camp turns into a rowdy competition with a scout group of \u201cnormies\u201d who double-booked the campground. Pugsley and his new friend Eugene (Moosa Mostafa) get into plenty of trouble when Pugsley inadvertently raises a zombie from the dead. And Principal Dort\u2019s enthusiasm for Nevermore is more than a little suspect, though whether it\u2019s pure zeal or something more sinister is a mystery unto itself.\nAll of this is delightfully macabre. Indeed, there are some genuinely surprising deaths here that I won\u2019t spoil for obvious reasons. There are some surprise returning guest stars as well, though I won\u2019t name names here. Wednesday treats its dark subject matter with just enough wit and humor to create a wonderful tonal dissonance. Ortega remains the perfect Wednesday Addams, her ferociously deadpan exterior masking her obvious compassion for those she cares about, including her bubbly werewolf roommate, Enid Sinclair (Emma Myers).\nFar too often, in my experience, the second season of a popular show loses what made the first season special. Writers run out of ideas. Production budgets are slashed, resulting in less attention to detail. The spark fizzles out, the thrill dies, the magic leaks out into the ether. Tim Burton and the cast and crew of Wednesday buck this trend, offering up a sophomore season that is every bit as fun and engaging and mysterious as Season 1.\nThat being said, given Netflix\u2019s two-part release schedule, it\u2019s impossible to offer up a full critique of Season 2. The second half of the season comes out on September 3rd. Given that the first half ends on quite a cliffhanger, this is a bit of an annoying delay. It\u2019s possible that the next four episodes will pale in comparison to the first, especially since so much is resolved in the first half, but I have high hopes that the entire season will be a worthy successor to the massively successful first.\nVerdict\nWednesday Season 2, Part 1 knocks it out of the park thanks to its compelling mystery, dark sense of humor and a stellar cast led by Jenna Ortega. If only we could binge more than four episodes!"
