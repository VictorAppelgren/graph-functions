  "content": "Registrations of new cars fell by 2.0% last month, new figures show.\n\nSome 82,908 new cars were registered in August, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.\n\nThe figure compares with 84,575 during the same month in 2024.\n\nBattery electric vehicles held a 26.5% share of the new car market in August, which was the highest monthly level this year.\n\nAugust is one of the quietest months of the year for new car sales as many people delay purchases until new number plates are introduced in September.\n\nSMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: \u201cAugust was the best month yet this year for EV market share and while it is often volatile due to low overall volumes, the overall trend is positive.\n\n\u201cSeptember will be critical, with the new number plate factor typically driving around one in seven new car registrations for the year.\n\n\u201cThere is now a vast choice of electric models across all segments and many consumers will also, for the first time in three years, benefit from a grant to help them switch to electric.\n\n\u201cWith more models being added to the Government\u2019s electric car grant each week, there is now every reason for drivers to make the switch, helping deliver both economic growth and decarbonisation.\u201d\n\nIan Plummer, chief commercial officer at online vehicle marketplace Auto Trader, said: \u201cThe Government\u2019s \u00a3650 million electric car grant helped reignite consumer interest for EVs, with advert views for new EVs under \u00a337,000 virtually doubling overnight.\n\n\u201cConsumers are keeping a close watch and as more eligible models receive the grant, we\u2019re seeing them attract more attention on our platform.\u201d\n\nThe grant gives a discount of \u00a31,500 or \u00a33,750 off the purchase price of specific EVs, based on their sustainability criteria.\n\nCars must be priced at no more than \u00a337,000 to be eligible.",

  "summary": "The registration of new cars in the UK fell by 2.0% in August, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). This is usually a quiet period for new car sales as many people delay purchases until September due to new number plates being introduced. The Society's CEO, Mike Hawes, stated that August was the best month yet for EV market share and that the overall trend is positive. The Government's \u00a3650 million electric car grant has boosted consumer interest for EV vehicles, with advert views for new EVs under \u00a337,000 rapidly rising.",
  "shortSummary": "In August, new car registrations fell by 2.0% to 82,908, with battery electric vehicles having a 26.5% share, driven by government grants and increased consumer interest.",

  "argos_summary": "New car registrations fell 2% in August, with 82,908 vehicles registered versus 84,575 a year earlier. Battery electric vehicles captured a record 26.5% share of the market, boosted by the \u00a3650\u202fmillion government grant that offers up to \u00a33,750 off eligible EVs priced under \u00a337,000. Despite the dip in overall sales, the trend toward electrification remains positive, and September is expected to be a critical month as consumers wait for new number plates. The grant\u2019s expanding eligibility is driving increased consumer interest and advertising for EVs, supporting both economic growth and decarbonisation efforts.",
