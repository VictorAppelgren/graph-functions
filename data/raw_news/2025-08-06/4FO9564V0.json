  "title": "Fiery Nancy Mace gets an ICY reception for top South Carolina job",
  "description": "It's early on, but South Carolinians who spoke to the Daily Mail the day Nancy Mace announced a run for governor were mostly unenthused with the hometown Republican maverick.",
  "content": "The primary election is ten months away, but many South Carolinians who spoke to the Daily Mail said they are unenthused about Nancy Mace's maverick campaign for governor.\n\n'No way, not for South Carolina,' Rodney, a Charleston resident, told the Daily Mail in the city's bustling downtown on Monday. He made it clear in other terms that he was not a MAGA fan.\n\nAnother resident, Sherry, told the Daily Mail she is 'not interested in Miss Mace.'\n\n'She's for our current president,' Sherry added, 'That's a no.'\n\nHalf of the voters the Daily Mail spoke to, most using first names only to protect their identities, were flat out against Mace, if not skeptical of her leadership in Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, Annie, a South Carolinian seemingly in her mid-twenties, was more enthusiastic about Mace's announcement.\n\n'It's awesome to have a woman run for governor,' she said. 'Historically, it has only been males in South Carolina, so I'm excited to see what she can do.'\n\nRep. Mace, 47, a third-term congresswoman who represents the coastal areas surrounding Charleston, announced on Monday she's running for governor in 2026. She's forged a fiery reputation for her dramatic confrontations with pro-transgender activists and divulged deeply personal stories about sexual assault and abuse.\n\nThe conservative is not shying away from her controversial reputation forged on Capitol Hill as she joins an already-crowded pack to replace outgoing Gov. Henry McMaster.\n\n'I'm not a huge fan of Nancy Mace for our governor,' said Trent, a Republican from Charleston. 'There's a couple of big things that I don't agree with her on.'\n\nHe didn't elaborate on what, but did relent that he'd vote for Mace 'if there's not a better candidate.'\n\nThough the race is still early, whoever secures an endorsement from President Donald Trump will likely hold a major advantage among the crowded GOP field.\n\nAnother South Carolinian, Bill, noted that Mace's announcement 'looks like an obvious step up for her ... after a bunch of years in Congress.'\n\nAnother Republican, David, admitted he didn't know anything about Mace.\n\n'Well, I really don't know much about her, but I'm gonna look at her for sure,' he responded. As a conservative, he'd likely go for whoever the GOP nominee is, he later clarified.\n\nMaebelle, an elderly lady who appeared to be in her eighties, was happy to hear of Mace's announcement and shared some excitement about the news because she claimed the two had met.\n\n'I think she's a cool person,' she told the Daily Mail. 'I met her once, and I think she'll be good.'\n\n'She seemed to be a fair person, and someone you can go to and talk to and for the right things.'\n\nEarly polling shows that the 47-year-old may be one of the top contenders to win the Republican nomination, though it's too close to early seen.\n\nA survey from the South Carolina Policy Council published last week found Mace with 16 percent support while state AG Wilson had 15 percent.\n\nWilson, the son of longtime congressman Joe Wilson, announced his bid for office last month. Mace sparked attacks against Wilson for mishandling legal cases and has painted him as someone 'who likes to put pedophiles on trial and give them one day in jail.'\n\nWilson has denied the accusation and has labeled the lawmaker a 'liar.'\n\nThe poll also showed Rep. Norman received 6 percent support, while Lt. Gov. Evette snagged 8 percent and State Sen. Josh Kimbrell had 3 percent. Still, over half of the respondents, 52 percent, said they were undecided.\n\nDuring Mace's campaign announcement at her alma mater, The Citadel, a military college in Charleston, South Carolina, she ripped into 'weak leadership' of the past.\n\nShe pledged to no longer 'turn a blind eye' to 'trannies invading women's spaces, an unaccountable judicial process and failed schools.'\n\nHer top priorities are to restore law and order, protect women and children and fix the judicial system.\n\nShe also had some new proposals: The Republican unveiled a five-year plan to eliminate state income taxes. 'Other states, like Florida, Tennessee, Texas, have zero state income tax,' she said.\n\nMace also announced initiatives to expand school choice, vocational education and floated policies that could help the state's authorities better cooperate with ICE to accelerate deportations.",

      "text": "With the first half of the 2025-26 legislative session in the rearview mirror, the South Carolina Policy Council is polling South Carolinians to see where they stand on the issues the legislature addressed last year and aim to address in 2026.\nWith a gubernatorial race on the horizon and both parties' primaries coming up we also wanted to see where our state stood on speculative candidates for both Democrats and Republicans. This poll also covers the issues of taxes and spending, transparency, education, parental rights, judicial reform, and lastly public sentiment towards tech and infrastructure.\nBelow you will find some of our key findings from our poll of 1,200 registered voters statewide, which was conducted by Targoz Market Research during the week of July 21 to 25. The poll\u2019s margin of error was plus or minus 2.77%.\nGubernatorial candidates and approval ratings\nTo start let's look at where voters are on Republican and Democratic gubernatorial candidates.\nRepublican-identifying voters were asked If the 2026 GOP primary for governor were held today, which of the following candidates would you choose? Their responses were as follows:\n- 16% selected Nancy Mace, U.S. Congresswoman\n- 15% selected Alan Wilson, Attorney General\n- 8% selected Pam Evette, Lieutenant Governor\n- 6% selected Ralph Norman, U.S. Congressman\n- 3% selected Josh Kimbrell, State Senator\n- 52% remain undecided\nAmong individuals who identified as Democrats, when asked, if the 2026 Democratic primary for governor were held today, which of the following candidates would you vote for? Respondents answered as follows:\n- 5% selected Jermaine Johnson, State Representative\n- 5% selected Jeffrey Graham, State Senator\n- 2% selected Russell Ott, State Senator\n- 2% selected Ed Sutton, State Senator\n- 2% selected Mandy Powers Norrell, Former State Representative\n- 83% remain undecided\nFollowing the conclusion of the first half of the 2025-26 legislative session, 49% of South Carolina voters approve of the way the South Carolina State Legislature is handling its job, while 43% disapprove. This is a decline from 55% approval in January from our poll earlier this year.\nTaxes and spending\nStates across the country are slashing taxes, and voters want to see South Carolina follow suit. across the board support eliminating income taxes. 73% of South Carolina voters support eliminating income taxes, while just 17% oppose the elimination of income taxes.\n74% of voters also believe that eliminating S.C.\u2019s state income tax would make the state more attractive for businesses and job creation.\nSCPC has advocated for a spending limit to prevent spending increases year over year by population and inflation growth. Voters agree with this proposition. 68% of Voters would support a state law codifying a spending limit based on population plus inflation while only 16% would oppose the measure.\nEducation\nWhen asked about their satisfaction with the way things are going in K-12 public education in South Carolina:\n- 47% were dissatisfied\n- 42% were satisfied\nA proposed Senate bill (S.537) would prohibit South Carolina public schools from adopting mandatory grading floors, which require teachers to assign minimum grades (e.g., 50 or 60 out of 100) for incomplete or low-quality work, and mandate zeros for assignments not submitted. 51% of South Carolinians support this proposal, while just 33% oppose.\nAdditionally South Carolinians strongly favor parental rights in the classroom. When asked how important it was that parents have the right to review all school curricula, access their child\u2019s educational records, and choose between public, private, or homeschool options without state interference, 72% said that\u2019s important with 56% saying it's very important.\nTransparency\nSouth Carolina voters strongly support efforts to increase transparency in both legislative proceedings and state budget decisions.\nWhen asked whether all legislative committee and subcommittee meetings should be livestreamed and archived for public viewing, 80% of respondents expressed support, with 53% saying they \"strongly support\" the measure.\nSupport was similarly strong for greater transparency around earmark spending. 81% of voters said they support a state law requiring full public disclosure of earmarks in the budget, including the name of the sponsoring lawmaker, the recipient, the amount, and the project\u2019s purpose, before the budget is approved.\nData centers and energy\nTemperatures on data centers remain mixed. When asked if they support the construction of new data centers in their community, 43% expressed opposition, with 42% expressing support to the idea.\nHowever, enthusiasm declines when energy costs come into the equation. Of those 42% who supported, when asked if they would still support building data centers even if it led to higher utility bills to fund infrastructure upgrades, less than half of them would continue to support.\nEnergy baseload is a critical component of that question, as the primary driver behind rising rates. Increased consumption will come at a cost to consumers. When asked if they supported expanding nuclear energy in South Carolina, 58% supported expanding nuclear energy, while only 27% opposed.\nTakeaways\nThe first take away revolves around the gubernatorial primaries. Both races are wide open with plenty of room. The majority of South Carolina voters on both sides of the isle are still undecided.\nAdditionally, these poll results highlight several key policy issues in South Carolina. South Carolinians across political party lines support eliminating income tax, adopting spending limits, and share concerns about data centers.\nEvaluating these crosstabs should be a reminder that the partisan political divide is not all as it seems, and that voters are united on far more issues than they think.\nFor the full crosstabs, see the links below:\nCrosstabs Generation, Income, Homeownership\nTransparency Initiative Disclosure\nIf you have questions about the poll or would like to arrange an interview, please email [email protected] or call 803-779-5022.\nMethodology statement:\n- Online poll of 1,200 registered voters in South Carolina conducted by Targoz Market Research.\n- Only respondents who passed our data quality checks were included in the final results and compensated for participating.\n- Sampling was stratified by demographics and geography.\n- Respondents were compensated for their participation.\n- Results were weighted by demographics, party, geography, and behavioral measures to properly reflect the profile of the state.\n- Estimated margin of error: +/- 2.77%\n- Fieldwork: July 21-25, 2025\n- Due to weighting and rounding, percentages may not always total exactly 100%.\nThis report may be republished in whole or in part, provided that proper credit is given to the author(s) and the South Carolina Policy Council."

Nancy Mace \u2013 as well as a top political consultant who accused her of using explosive photos for 'blackmail.'\nThe filing by the alleged assault victim describes a 2018 incident where they claim a witness saw video footage of her being assaulted and filmed without her consent.\nShe was allegedly passed out on the couch at a Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, home at the time.\nThe alleged assault featured in Mace's stunning House floor speech from March after she threatened to go 'scorched earth' against people she called predators. It has since kicked off a series of legal action.\nMace in a statement called herself a 'key witness for victims,' alleges she faces a 'smear campaign,' and accuses a former advisor of 'flagrant dishonesty.' She calls herself a 'key cooperating witness.'\nShe said Wednesday her ex-fianc\u00e9 filed a 'fictitious lawsuit to target, defame and intimidate her as a key witness in a sexual assault investigation.'\nThe amended complaint hits back with new allegations against longtime South Carolina consultant Wesley Donehue, whose newly revealed deposition appeared to undermine some of Mace's claims about the case.\nDonehue says he 'fired' Mace as a client because she was becoming 'erratic and unstable.'\nAfter a former consultant who 'fired' Nancy Mace as a client gave a deposition that accused her of 'blackmail,' a new legal filing hit back at Mace's ex fiance as well as the man who accused her of trying to use photos for financial leverage\nHis allegations came under oath in a deposition that DailyMail revealed in May.\nIn his sworn deposition, the consultant accused Mace of engaging in blackmail when she asked him to contact her former fiance, Patrick Bryant, to tell him she had obtained video evidence from his phone and use it as 'leverage' to gain ownership of two homes they were squabbling over in DC and Isle of Palms, South Carolina.\nThe homes have a combined value of $5 million. A source familiar with the matter denied the blackmail charge.\nThe 'Jane Doe' suit alleges that Mace's ex-fiance gave Mace access to his phone after a pastor told the then-couple Bryant needed to 'build trust' and she subsequently viewed his phone while he was sleeping. Mace then found photos and images of the alleged sexual assault, the complaint alleges.\nIt says Mace was 'haunted' by the images, finally establishing contact with the alleged victim in 2024, about a year before her stunning House floor speech where she referenced the alleged assault and identified four men as alleged sexual 'predators.'\nAccording to the amended complaint, it is Donehue who engaged in 'blackmail.'\nIt says the longtime consultant who dumped Mace as a client made 'false and defamatory statements about Mace' that also 'prejudiced Plaintiff.'\nThe filing says Mace had reported pictures and images she found on Bryant's phone to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) in December 2023 \u2013 'well before she talked to Donehue.'\n'Therefore, she could not have asked Donehue to blackmail Bryant, because Bryant was already under investigation at the time,' the filing says.\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Donehue for comment.\nThe complaint also took on Donehue's dramatic public firing of Mace. He had posted:\n'I fired Nancy Mace as client a few months back because I'm a political consultant and not a babysitter, a sex therapist or a doctor who can prescribe fixes for chemical imbalances.\n'I don't have time for her constant egotistical bulls*** and drama in my life.'\nThe suit said Mace and Bryant had settled their property dispute by May of 2024, before Donehue fired Mace, 'so she would not have asked Donehue to blackmail Bryant.'\nThe developments in court follow Mace's explosive House floor speech\nMace and Bryant had joint ownership of properties in South Carolina and D.C. that proved contentious after they split\nMace accused her ex-fianc\u00e9 Patrick Bryant (right) and two of his associates, including John Osborne (left) of planning and filming the assault\nBusinessman Eric Bowman, 45, left, and software entrepreneur Brian Musgrave, 51, right, were two of four men Mace accused in her floor speech of being involved in the alleged sexual assault of an intoxicated woman at Bowman's home in 2018. All four men have categorically denied the claims\nTrump loyalist Nancy Mace has set up a sexual assault hotline and is considered a potential candidate for governor in her state\n'Moreover, emails reveal the real reason that Donehue fired Mace as a client is that she wanted access to her Google Analytics, and Donehue didn't want to give her access to her own data,' the lawsuit says. It provides no further details on the the cause of the break.\n'Donehue, not Mace, is the one engaged in blackmail,' the filing alleges. 'In December of 2024, Donehue sent Mace hostile and threatening text messages when she had a public dispute with Trey Gowdy, one of Donahue's [sic]. Donehue texted Mace \"And let me be very clear with you. You do not want to pick a fight with me ...'\nAnd in yet another sweeping allegation, the lawsuit accuses Mace's ex-fiance Bryant of establishing an LLC for the 'improper' purpose of conducting depositions to 'disseminate false information and discredit the Plaintiff's witensses, thereby interfering with her right to have a fair and impartial jury in future criminal and civil proceedings.'\nMace has filed a motion to intervene in the case against a Bryant shell company.\nThe lawsuit names three men as defendants: Bryant, John Osborne, and Eric Bowman, as well as two companies as well as three LLCs. State police opened an investigation into her bombshell claims in February.\nBryant told Daily Mail in a statement, 'I'm doing everything I can to clear my name. I've answered every allegation in court, secured key witness testimony, and I remain committed to making sure the whole truth, not rumor, comes to light about me and my businesses.'\nBowman has previously said he has spoken to SLED and denies wrongdoing. SLED has confirmed it opened an investigation into Bryant. Bryant issued a statement immediately after Mace's February 10 speech - which aired live to the nation on CSPAN - saying: 'I categorically deny these allegations.'\nAnd Osborne previously told The Post & Courier: 'The claims are categorically untrue and it is completely unfair to be looped into such accusations.' None of the people Mace identified have been charged with a crime.\nThe legal filing says Bowman and Bryant 'defamed' the plaintiff online and accuses them of 'humiliating' her on social media.\nBowman, the first of the four branded as predators on the House floor by Mace, previously told the Daily Mail that the accuser fell into his pool while drunk and passed out on his couch.\n'She walked inside by herself and went to dry off in the bathroom and put herself on the couch. She was fully coherent until she put herself to sleep,' he said.\n'At some point her boyfriend comes and picks her up. That's it,' he said."

      "text": "From Cabinet secretaries to Oval Office advisors and Mar-a-Lago confidants, capturing the attention and approval of the world's most powerful man is a daily battle.\nDonald Trump has surrounded himself with steadfastly loyal family members and obedient allies during his meteoric rise to the White House.\nThe question is: Who is the most significant powerbroker behind the world's most famous man?\nIs it Vice President J.D. Vance or the 'ice maiden' chief of staff Susie Wiles? Or could it be the not-so-secret weapon of Trump's historic 2024 campaign, his youngest son Barron?\nToday, Daily Mail+ can reveal the answer based on America's perception of what goes on in the MAGA corridors of power.\nThe Trump World Power List provides definitive rankings of the most influential figures in the 47th President's orbit.\nOur survey tested 20 members of Trump's inner circle - from senior aides to his children - on how voters perceive their trustworthiness, likeability and knowledge - all traits prized by the leader of the free world.\nThese are the figures who help shape policy, craft messaging and guide the president through his most punishing political challenges.\nThey are also the characters closest to him, whether in the White House or his private clubs in Palm Beach and Bedminster, New Jersey.\nThis Trump World Power List serves as an essential guide to who Americans believe holds the most sway as the president navigates the rollercoaster that is his second term.\nDonald Trump has surrounded himself with steadfastly loyal family members and obedient allies. The question is: Who is the most influential? The DailyMail+ Power List has the answer\nWhile Donald Trump may be the king of MAGA, our results show there's no doubt Melania Trump is the queen.\nMelania was crowned the undisputed favorite of Donald Trump's inner circle when Americans were asked who is the most popular member.\nIn our Trump World Power List, the First Lady comfortably claimed the top spot, with her 19\u2011year\u2011old son Barron in second.\nWhite House 'border czar' Tom Homan - the man behind one of the most comprehensive immigration crackdowns in history - came in third.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has accused President Barack Obama and his allies of manufacturing the Russian collusion hoax against Trump, came in fourth.\nTrump's star press secretary Karoline Leavitt came in fifth and Ivanka Trump - who's kept her distance from politics so far in the second administration - ranked sixth.\nThe results, based on a survey of 1,000 voters conducted with J.L. Partners, suggest Melania's tactful demeanor and avoidance of daily political drama has only boosted her power.\nAt 55, the former model earned the highest approval ratings in key categories, including trustworthiness and knowledge, and was the Trump World figure voters said they'd most like to spend time with, along with Ivanka.\nShe has chosen her public appearances sparingly, but behind the scenes has reportedly long been one of her husband's closest counselors.\nWhen responding to international scandals - including the renewal of military aid to Ukraine and the push to increase food-aid for Gazans - Trump acknowledged Melania was part of his decision-making process.\nA spokesman for the First Lady celebrated the result in an exclusive statement to the Daily Mail, highlighting her pivotal role in her husband's second term.\n'The First Lady's impact on her husband's decision-making process is unparalleled,' the spokesman said.\n'She possesses an unmatched level of influence compared to any adviser or cabinet member.\n'Mrs. Trump can discreetly influence policy in a manner that is rarely observed by the public due to her singular position.'\nA source close to Trump added that it makes perfect sense Melania dominated the rankings.\n'She's the president's closest confidante,' the source said.\nAnother popular Trump family member is Barron Trump, who - our poll shows - has become a breakout star in his own right, despite avoiding the limelight.\nThe 6-foot-7-inch tall New York University freshman finished second overall and was voted one of the most fun and truthful figures in Trump World.\nThe 19-year-old outshined his older siblings and even top aides, ranking as the third most knowledgeable behind Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his mother, Melania.\nBarron's rare public appearances - towering beside his parents at Mar\u2011a\u2011Lago and on the 2024 campaign trail - have fueled curiosity and helped him resonate with younger conservatives.\nWhile Barron focuses on business studies in Manhattan and keeps a tight circle of friends - with rumors of love interests purely gossip and speculation - his quiet influence is undeniable.\nSources say his close bond with his mother and private life in Trump Tower have shielded him from the turbulence that often follows the rest of his family.\n'Barron's polished, youthful presence, combined with his role in helping his father connect with Gen Z and young male voters, makes him an instant favorite,' said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean.\nAs for the president's other children, First Daughter Ivanka Trump was one of her father's key advisors during his first term.\nNow she has stepped back from politics, choosing to focus on philanthropy and life Florida with husband Jared Kushner and their three children.\nHer softer public image and focus on philanthropy appears to have kept her in Americans' good graces.\n'Ivanka hasn't talked politics in five years,' one GOP insider told the Daily Mail. 'That makes her far less polarizing - even Democrats have a hard time disliking her now.'\nThis may explain why Donald Trump Jr., one of the president's most plain-spoken children, ranked towards the bottom of our list.\nMelania Trump was crowned the undisputed favorite of Donald Trump's inner circle when Americans were asked who is the most popular member\nIn our Trump World Power List, the First Lady comfortably claimed the top spot, with her 19\u2011year\u2011old son Barron in second\nThe 47-year-old was voted the least likeable, least truthful and most biased member of the Trump World.\nOn the question of whether he is fun, only Marco Rubio ranked lower.\nSince November 2024, Don Jr. has been chasing lucrative deals for the Trump Organization, securing contracts for golf resorts and hotels in the Middle East.\nHe has joined the boards of multiple companies including a drone manufacturer and the prediction market Kalshi. Yet he has remained a staunch supporter of his father's policies and is quick to go on the offensive against critics.\nSources familiar with Trump's inner circle told the Daily Mail they were not surprised by the first son's low ranking among voters:\n'The more outspoken you are, the more you create fans, but also more enemies,' one source said.\nDon Jr.'s former fianc\u00e9 and nominee for United States Ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle, also fared poorly.\nBarron Trump has become the movement's breakout star - despite staying away from the limelight his family attracts. The 19-year-old came second in the DailyMail+ Power List\nFirst Daughter Ivanka Trump, pictured at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, still ranked highly in our list despite stepping away from politics\nAmericans voted the 56-year-old as the MAGA figure they would least like to spend time with, alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nShe also finished last in knowledge, behind billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\nVice President J.D. Vance also had little to celebrate. He ranked as the second least likeable and the fourth least truthful, just above Pam Bondi, Kristi Noem and Don Jr.\nRecent poll results, however, have been in his favor, giving him confidence if he decides to chas the Oval Office himself.\nMultiple surveys - including one conducted by the Daily Mail - have him as the favorite for the Republican nomination in 2028.\nA White House insider told the Daily Mail that Vance needs to learn from DailyMail+ Power List results, especially if he sets his sights on the White House.\n'The Vice President has been a strong advocate and champion for the Trump-Vance agenda across the administration, Capitol Hill and the broader MAGA movement,' the insider said.\n'But following the midterms, he'll need to define what sets him apart from the rest of the field.'\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth struggled in the face of scrutiny over controversies in the Pentagon.\nMonths after questions about his leadership erupted when details of a Yemen airstrike were shared on the messaging app Signal, Hegseth was voted the fourth least likable and sixth least knowledgeable.\nDonald Trump Jr., one of the president's most plain-spoken children, ranked towards the bottom of our list. He's pictured with his girlfriend Bettina Anderson\nKaroline Leavitt's no-nonsense attitude toward dealing with reporters appears to have won over the public.\nAmericans picked Leavitt as fourth most likeable and fun. When it came to who those polled wanted to hang out with, she came in third.\nHer success seemed to be an outlier for the rest of the results that offer a blunt reality check for Trump's inner circle: the quieter, more enigmatic family members now outshine the loudest loyalists.\nLast week we launched the DailyMail+ Power List by revealing the best-loved (and most loathed) morning-show hosts and news media stars.\nThis week, we ranked the sports analysts who divide the opinion of millions of fans across the country.\nIn the weeks ahead, we'll bring you our power list rankings for more figures in the world of media, US politics, fashion and sport."

      "text": "Controversial GOP firebrand Nancy Mace vows more 'under their skin' antics as she launches South Carolina governor bid\nRepublican firebrand Nancy Mace has launched a bid to become South Carolina's next governor on a platform reminiscent of President Donald Trump's.\nAnd she's not shying away from her reputation in Congress as a pain-in-the-side rabble rouser while pushing pro-Trump policies.\nDuring her four and a half years in office, Mace, 47, established herself from the pack of Republican women due to her many antics in Congress.\nAt first, she appeared to be a moderate, eager to work on bipartisan work. Now she's campaigning on how she ruffles feathers on both sides of the aisle.\n'I'm running to put South Carolina first,' Rep. Nancy Mace said.\nDuring her campaign announcement at her alma mater The Citadel, a military college in Charleston, South Carolina, she ripped into 'weak leadership' of the past.\nShe pledged to no longer 'turn a blind eye' to 'trannies invading women's spaces, an unaccountable judicial process and failed schools.'\nHer top priorities are to restore law and order, protect women and children and fix the judicial system.\nAnd she's not backing away from her controversial reputation that she earned in the House of Representatives as she joins an already-crowded pack to replace outgoing Gov. Henry McMaster.\nRepublican Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina announced she is running for governor\nOther hopefuls include State Attorney General Alan Wilson, anti-Trump Rep. Ralph Norman, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and State Sen. Josh Kimbrell.\nMace 'has drawn the ire of both Democrats and members of her own party,' a narrator in one of her new gubernatorial TV commercials obtained by the Daily Mail says.\n'She has a way of getting under their skin.'\nShe also had some new proposals: The Republican unveiled a five-year plan to eliminate state income taxes. 'Other states, like Florida, Tennessee, Texas, have zero state income tax,' she said.\nMace also announced initiatives to expand school choice, vocational education and floated policies that could help the state's authorities better cooperate with ICE to accelerate deportations.\nBefore she took the stage at The Citadel, a Trump-inspired playlist of MAGA rally favorites like the Village People's YMCA and Lee Greenwood's 'God Bless the USA' blared out.\nMace allies donning a mix of suits, golf polos, sandals and Lilly Pulitzer highlighter-colored dresses bobbed along in the crowd.\nShe's proved to be a conservative rabble-rouser since her election to Congress in 2021.\nMace was one of eight GOP lawmakers to vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and has crusaded through Capitol Hill vowing to protect women in the name of restricting transgender rights.\nMace has been increasingly at odds with the trans community in recent years.\nOnce, she even barged into a Capitol restroom along with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., to investigate whether the patron was actually a woman. (Turns out she was).\nShe has even been confronted by members of the trans community at her town halls and political events.\n'Tranny, tranny, tranny. I don't really care. You want penises in women's bathrooms and I'm not going to have it. No, thank you,' Mace fumed during a House Oversight Committee hearing in February about USAID funding to LGBT initiatives globally.\nIn February, Mace spoke on the House floor for an hour about her ex-fianc\u00e9 whom she stunningly accused of being involved in sex crimes.\nMace holds up handcuffs and asks if anyone wants to arrest her for speaking out on behalf of women. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division confirmed it opened an investigation into alleged assault, harassment, and voyeurism on Dec. 14, 2023\nMace speaking at the Republican National Convention in July 2024\nState police in South Carolina later opened an investigation into Mace's stunning claims that she uncovered a rape and sex trafficking ring after sifting through digital information on her ex-fiance's phone.\nMace's ex-fianc\u00e9 has denied the allegations.\nDuring her remarks, which had some extra legal protections because she gave them from the House floor, Mace slammed South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, her opponent in the state's governor race, for failing to investigate the matter.\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division confirmed a probe into the matter one day after the extraordinary speech, where she identified four men she said were 'predators' and said she had uncovered video of herself being raped.\nMace's stunning House floor speech and threat to go 'scorched earth' against people she called predators has since kicked off a series of legal action.\nMace in a statement called herself a 'key witness for victims,' alleges she faces a 'smear campaign,' and accuses a former advisor of 'flagrant dishonesty.' She calls herself a 'key cooperating witness.'\nThe congresswoman told the Daily Mail on Monday that case regarding her ex is part of the reason she jumped into the gubernatorial race.\n'Well, one of the reasons I'm running is because of what happened ... I understand how broken the system is,' she said. 'I have spoken to now so many victims unrelated to that case, and there's still an open and ongoing investigation.'\n'This is not about me,' she insisted. 'This is about protecting them, and I'll tell you, the establishment is coming after me because I'm standing up and fighting.'"

While some residents appreciate her as a trailblazer for women in politics, others criticize her controversial stances and lack of enthusiasm for her leadership. Mace's campaign focuses on restoring law and order, protecting women and children, and eliminating state income taxes, amidst a crowded field of GOP candidates.",
