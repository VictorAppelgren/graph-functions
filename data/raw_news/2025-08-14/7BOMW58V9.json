  "description": "A federal judge has struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation\u2019s schools and universities",
  "content": "A mural by artist Tene Smith is seen near the entrance of Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit dedicated to training and retaining women in the skilled construction trades.\n\nA federal judge on Thursday struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation\u2019s schools and universities.\n\nIn her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland found that the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continued with DEI initiatives.\n\nThe guidance has been on hold since April when three federal judges blocked various portions of the Education Department\u2019s anti-DEI measures.\n\nThe ruling Thursday followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government\u2019s actions in a February lawsuit.\n\nThe case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all \u201crace-based decision-making\u201d or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It\u2019s part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.\n\nThe new ruling orders the department to scrap the guidance because it runs afoul of procedural requirements, though Gallagher wrote that she took no view on whether the policies were \u201cgood or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.\u201d\n\nGallagher, who was appointed by President Trump, rejected the government\u2019s argument that the memos simply served to remind schools that discrimination is illegal.\n\n\u201cIt initiated a sea change in how the Department of Education regulates educational practices and classroom conduct, causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished,\u201d Gallagher wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, called it an important victory over the administration\u2019s attack on DEI.\n\n\u201cThreatening teachers and sowing chaos in schools throughout America is part of the administration\u2019s war on education, and today the people won,\u201d said Skye Perryman, the group\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nThe Education Department did not immediately comment on Thursday.\n\nThe conflict started with a Feb. 14 memo declaring that any consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, hiring or other aspects of academic and student life would be considered a violation of federal civil rights law.\n\nThe memo dramatically expanded the government\u2019s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring colleges from considering race in admissions decisions. The government argued the ruling applied not only to admissions but across all of education, forbidding \u201crace-based preferences\u201d of any kind.\n\n\u201cEducational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon \u2018systemic and structural racism\u2019 and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,\u201d wrote Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.\n\nA further memo in April asked state education agencies to certify they were not using \u201cillegal DEI practices.\u201d Violators risked losing federal money and being prosecuted under the False Claims Act, it said.\n\nIn total, the guidance amounted to a full-scale reframing of the government\u2019s approach to civil rights in education. It took aim at policies that were created to address longstanding racial disparities, saying those practices were their own form of discrimination.\n\nThe memos drew a wave of backlash from states and education groups that called it illegal government censorship.\n\nIn its lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers said the government was imposing \u201cunclear and highly subjective\u201d limits on schools across the country. It said teachers and professors had to \u201cchoose between chilling their constitutionally protected speech and association or risk losing federal funds and being subject to prosecution.\u201d\n\nBinkley writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "- Share via\n- Celaya\u2019s mayor replaced most of the local police force with national guard troops after a wave of cartel violence and the assassination of a mayoral candidate.\n- More municipalities are leaning on the military for local policing.\n- Police corruption is endemic in much of Mexico. One officer in Celaya warned her sister to be wary.\nCELAYA, Mexico \u2014 On a sunny spring day last year, a young attorney named Gisela Gayt\u00e1n kicked off her campaign for mayor in this gritty Mexican city.\nUnder her blouse she wore a ballistic vest.\nCelaya had become the epicenter of a bloody cartel war, with one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and a local police force that appeared powerless to stop it.\n\u201cWe must recover the security that we so long for,\u201d Gayt\u00e1n, 38, wrote on social media before setting out that day.\nAs she shook hands at an event on the outskirts of town, a man approached, raised a gun and shot her in the head.\nAfter her funeral, where a priest lamented \u201ca death caused by murderers who believe they control society,\u201d local Morena party leaders picked a new candidate: Juan Miguel Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez, a bespectacled former university rector who had worked on Gayt\u00e1n\u2019s campaign.\nRam\u00edrez believed that one of Celaya\u2019s most urgent problems was its police, who instead of fighting organized crime appeared to be involved in it.\nHis son-in-law had been killed in a case that was still unsolved, and officers had demanded bribes and obstructed the investigation. Police misconduct was well documented: Local cops were prosecuted for abusing detainees and participating in kidnappings and even homicides.\nRam\u00edrez won the election. And in his first act as mayor, he fired 340 of the roughly 600 officers on the force. Then \u2014 as officials across Mexico have been doing for nearly two decades now \u2014 he called in federal troops.\nMexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n first deployed soldiers into the streets to fight drug traffickers in 2006, promising then that the military would stay only until police could be reformed.\nIn the years since, leaders across the political spectrum have repeatedly vowed to better train and root out corruption among the country\u2019s cops \u2014 a step that security experts agree is essential to reducing crime and violence.\nBut with the exception of Mexico\u2019s capital and a few other major cities, those efforts have lost steam. Officials have slashed funding for state and local police forces, and disbanded the federal police altogether. Cops continue to be near-universally reviled, with federal surveys showing that 9 out of 10 Mexicans don\u2019t trust the police.\nAt the same time, Mexico has vastly expanded the military\u2019s role in public security. There are now more soldiers, marines and members of the national guard deployed nationally than state and local police officers, according to an analysis by the Citizen Security Program at the Universidad Iberoamericana. In most parts of the country, there are fewer state and local police today than there were when the drug war began in 2006.\n\u201cThe police have been abandoned in favor of militarization,\u201d said Ernesto L\u00f3pez Portillo, a researcher who leads the Iberoamericana program.\nThere is little evidence that the strategy has worked. Homicides remain persistently high, although they have dipped slightly in recent years. And cartels have only expanded their reach, with a U.S. military analysis finding that criminal groups control more than one-third of Mexico.\nYet officials continue to embrace militarization as the country\u2019s primary security strategy. That even includes leftists who once fiercely warned of the dangers of ceding public security to soldiers, including President Claudia Sheinbaum and her predecessor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\nThe mayor\u2019s abrupt decision to summarily replace most of the police force in Celaya, a patchwork of farmland and factories in central Guanajuato state, is a case study in why Mexicans have lost faith in local law enforcement \u2014 and what happens when soldiers take over.\nCelaya used to be a tranquil city. Its location along a highway and railroad that stretch 600 miles to the United States drew Honda and other automakers to build plants here.\nFor years, a local criminal group called the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel quietly stole fuel from the major oil pipelines that cross the region.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the notorious Jalisco New Generation Cartel edged in several years ago that violence exploded. The groups battled for control of pipelines but also drug trafficking, extortion rackets and theft of cargo trucks.\nCelaya became synonymous with violence as criminals gunned down shopkeepers who refused to pay extortion fees, drug users who couldn\u2019t pay their dealers and everyday citizens who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They carried out massacres at hotels, bars and even funerals.\nBy 2024, Celaya had a homicide rate of 87 killings per 100,000 people \u2014 17 times the rate in the United States.\nIt had long been clear that the city\u2019s police force was, at best, not up to the challenge \u2014 and, at worst, deeply corrupt.\nThe 600 cops on the force in Celaya, which has a population of around half a million, were half of the 1,200 that the United Nations recommends for a city of its size. Officers were poorly trained and badly paid.\nThat made them easy targets for criminals who offered cash in exchange for intelligence, muscle or simply looking the other way when a crime was committed. When police didn\u2019t cooperate \u2014 or didn\u2019t cooperate correctly \u2014 they were often killed.\nIn 2024, a cop here was 400 times more likely to be killed than one in the United States.\nFanny Ram\u00edrez, the daughter of a street vendor and a maid, was 21 when she enrolled in Celaya\u2019s police academy. After eight years with the force, she earned just $900 a month, little more than a worker on an assembly line. Her boyfriend was also a police officer in Celaya.\nFanny warned her family to steer clear of the cops, said her sister, Elisabeth. After Elisabeth\u2019s husband witnessed a triple homicide several years ago, Fanny instructed him: \u201cGo inside and say you don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\u201cThe police are supposed to take care of you,\u201d Elisabeth said. \u201cBut here, we have to protect ourselves from the police.\u201d\nMayor Ram\u00edrez wasn\u2019t the first local politician to try to clean house. Previous leaders had made a show of purging dozens or even hundreds of police officers that they claimed were rotten.\nBut with most mayors serving just a single three-year term and scant public funds, reform efforts gained no traction. Experts say change takes time and requires concrete action to raise salaries, improve recruitment criteria and strengthen oversight.\nOn the national level, the approach to policing was inconsistent. Before he was elected president in 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador criticized his predecessors for replacing police with soldiers.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use the military to make up for the civilian government\u2019s shortcomings,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador insisted, vowing to send soldiers \u201cback to their barracks.\u201d\n1. Angel Romero, center, an instructor in defense training, teaches cadets hand to hand combat. 2. Cadets perform tactical rifle training to be officers. 3. Marcos Alfredo Morales, an active municipal police officer of 20 years, instructs cadets in practical firearm usage.\nOn taking office, he changed his tune. Facing record high homicide rates, he released a security plan that argued that taking soldiers off the streets would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d because cops were \u201ccontrolled by organized crime and moved by self-interest and corruption.\u201d\nHe dismantled the federal police, a famously corrupt force whose longtime leader was convicted in the U.S. of taking bribes from the Sinaloa cartel.\nAnd L\u00f3pez Obrador steered money once destined for local and state law enforcement to create a 120,000-officer-strong national guard, a force he vowed would be \u201cincorruptible\u201d and civilian-led, and which was supposed to take over the investigative functions of the federal police.\nIn fact, nearly 90% of the members of the national guard are former soldiers, and few have been trained to carry out investigations.\nIn Celaya, violence continued to spiral. And policing never improved.\nLast year, about a month before the mayoral candidate was cut down with bullets, Fanny set out to drop her 6-year-old daughter off at child care before starting work. She was driving a sedan that belonged to her boyfriend.\nAssailants opened fire. She and her daughter died on the spot. A few months later, Fanny\u2019s boyfriend was gunned down, too.\nNeither case has been solved, but Fanny\u2019s sister believes the deaths were connected to the boyfriend\u2019s ties to organized crime.\n1. A Celaya police officer questions a woman after a person was detained for suspicious behavior. The subject was later released when it was revealed he lived at the home with the woman. 2. National guard troops and police apprehend a subject for suspicious behavior in Celaya. 3. A fake firearm was found in the suspect\u2019s possession. He was released.\nShortly after he was elected mayor in June 2024, Ram\u00edrez said he was approached by cartel members who asked for positions in his government. He said he rebuffed them, but was shaken.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid like all citizens,\u201d he said.\nHe met with Mexico\u2019s top public security official and told her he had no confidence in Celaya\u2019s police. \u201cNot all of them were bad,\u201d he said recently, \u201cbut most were.\u201d She pledged to send him 500 members of the national guard.\nThe mayor\u2019s mass firing of police faced criticism from his political opponents.\nMauro Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00ednez, the top security official in Guanajuato state, a former federal police officer and member of an opposition party, said national guard troops and other members of the armed forces were not equipped to fight crime.\n\u201cThe army is trained for war,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cA police officer investigates. A soldier kills.\u201d\nNancy Ang\u00e9lica Canjura Luna, an analyst at a think tank called Causa en Comun, said that while soldiers are seen as less corruptible than police because they typically come from other parts of the country, that means they know little about the region they are supposed to be protecting.\n\u201cThey are always new,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know the criminal dynamics and they don\u2019t know the territory itself.\u201d\nBut others in Celaya, exhausted by years of violence, welcomed the troops and two high-ranking military officers loaned to the city to lead its new security force as a show of strength.\nArmy Col. Pablo Mu\u00f1oz Huitr\u00f3n and Lt. Col. Bernardo Cajero rode into town in an armed convoy, dressed in camouflage fatigues. As they strode into City Hall, they were flanked by soldiers.\nMu\u00f1oz was quickly sworn in as Celaya\u2019s secretary of public security, a role traditionally occupied by civilians, but which in many cities is now filled by current or former soldiers or marines. Cajero was tasked with leading the officers who had survived the purge and the guardsman who now worked alongside them.\nWhen Cajero switched from his olive green army fatigues to a blue police uniform, he was startled by how differently people treated him.\n\u201cMy first realization was how much people hate the police,\u201d he said.\nThe pair, who had served in cartel hot spots like Tamaulipas and Michoac\u00e1n, devised a plan. The city\u2019s remaining police would patrol alongside members of the military to reduce opportunities for corruption.\nSecurity forces would focus on improving response times for 911 calls and increasing the number of checkpoints around the city to make sure drivers weren\u2019t carrying guns or drugs.\nCelaya\u2019s leaders say crime rates have fallen.\nBetween January and June, there were 158 homicides in the city, according to the local government, down from 257 during the same time last year.\nBut high-profile acts of violence continue.\n1. A woman holds the daughter of a taxi driver who was shot and killed in May in Celaya, Guanajuato. The young girl was in the passenger seat. 2. Police and paramedics at the scene where a taxi driver was shot and killed.\nCajero was patrolling on a recent night when the radio crackled with a report of a homicide. His convoy raced to an intersection where a taxi lay overturned. The driver had been shot. His 12-year-old daughter, who had been in the passenger seat, survived but was in shock.\n\u201cTake me to my father,\u201d she wailed as a paramedic tended to her wounds.\nEarlier this year, the mayor\u2019s bodyguard was shot to death outside his own home. Ram\u00edrez, who cries while remembering him, said the perpetrators were likely criminals angry about his new security plan. \u201cObviously it was to send me a message,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said.\nSome locals have bristled at the presence of federal forces in their streets. Alejandro, a 24-year-old Uber driver who did not give his last name because of fear of reprisals, said he had been stopped frequently by national guard members, and treated as roughly as by police while they reviewed his car and identity. \u201cThey\u2019re all the same,\u201d he said.\nThis summer, 11 members of the national guard were charged with theft after they were caught extracting fuel from an illegal tap not far from Celaya.\n\u201cHow can we trust people who are robbing from us?\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThat\u2019s not logical.\u201d\nThe front-runner in Mexico\u2019s presidential election brought down crime as Mexico City mayor. Can Claudia Sheinbaum save Mexico from rampant violence?\nSheinbaum won the presidency last year in part on a promise to replicate the security strategy she had embraced as mayor of Mexico City, which focused on improving investigations, professionalizing cops and implementing community policing models developed in U.S. cities such as Oakland. But as president she has taken few steps toward police reform, and she recently pushed a constitutional amendment that puts the national guard permanently under military control.\nThe lack of federal help has made it challenging for Celaya\u2019s efforts to rebuild its police force.\nOn a recent afternoon at the city\u2019s aging police academy, young officers rappelled down walls and simulated hand-to-hand combat. They practiced wielding guns but not actually shooting them because the cost of bullets was too high.\nOne recent graduate, 29-year-old Jose Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Herrera, decided to join the police after his brother, a merchant, was killed by criminals.\nHern\u00e1ndez said instructors rarely discussed how police should handle bribery offers from organized crime, even if it may be only a matter of time before he is approached.\n\u201cYou\u2019re never 100% prepared,\u201d he said, adding that he would refuse to cooperate for his brother\u2019s memory, and because he wants his son to live in a city where he can trust police. \u201cIf you really want to change your society, you have to make the right decision, even if it\u2019s the more complicated one.\u201d\nRam\u00edrez has touted young officers like Hern\u00e1ndez as the future of Celaya. But the academy is graduating fewer than 20 officers a month, and is struggling to recruit new officers. Pay starts at just $800 a month.\nRecently, the city put out a call to current and former soldiers, asking them to take jobs on the force.\nEstefania Vela, a human rights lawyer at a think tank called Intersecta, worries militarization is near-sighted.\n\u201cNobody disputes that the police have problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what are you doing to fix those problems?\u201d\nOfficials say the new force is not intended to be permanent. But how long will they stay? And what happens when they leave?\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary today,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz, the colonel in charge of the deployment. \u201cTomorrow, who knows?\u201d"

      "text": "Man accused of faking his death to avoid rape charges is found guilty of sexual assault in Utah\n- Share via\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 A Rhode Island man accused of faking his death and fleeing the United States to evade rape charges was found guilty late Wednesday of sexually assaulting a former girlfriend in his first of two Utah trials.\nAn eight-person jury in Salt Lake County found Nicholas Rossi guilty of a 2008 rape after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents took the stand. Rossi, 38, declined to testify on his own behalf. He will be sentenced on Oct. 20 and is set to stand trial in September on another rape charge in Utah County.\nFirst-degree felony rape carries a punishment in Utah of five years to life in prison, said Salt Lake County Dist. Atty. Sim Gill.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the survivor in this case for her willingness to come forward, years after this attack took place,\u201d Gill said in a statement. \u201cIt took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable.\u201d\nUtah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified through a decade-old DNA rape kit in 2018. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.\nMonths after he was charged in Utah County, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on Feb. 29, 2020, of late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.\nHe was arrested in Scotland the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19 after hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos from an Interpol notice.\nExtradited to Utah in January 2024, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.\nHe appeared in court this week in a wheelchair, wearing a suit and tie and using an oxygen tank.\nRossi\u2019s public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas years later.\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to move, you\u2019re allowed to go somewhere else, you\u2019re allowed to have a different name,\u201d attorney Samantha Dugan said.\nThroughout the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of an intelligent man who used his charm to take advantage of a vulnerable young woman. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly.\nThe woman was living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within about two weeks.\nShe testified Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn\u2019t be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.\nDeputy Salt Lake County Dist. Atty. Brandon Simmons told jurors Wednesday that the woman did not consent. \u201cThis is not romantic, this is not her mistaking things.\u201d\nThe woman said her parents\u2019 dismissive comments convinced her not to go to the police. She came forward a decade later after seeing him in the news and learning he was accused of another rape from the same year.\nRossi\u2019s lawyers said the woman built up years of resentment after he made her foot the bill for everything in their monthlong relationship. They argued she accused him of rape to get back at him years later when he was getting media attention, and sought to undermine her credibility with jurors.\nRossi\u2019s public defender did not immediately respond to telephone and email messages seeking comment after the verdict.\nRossi\u2019s accuser in the Utah County case, who testified at this week\u2019s trial, is also a former girlfriend. She went to police at the time of that alleged rape. He is accused of attacking her at his apartment in Orem in September 2008 after she came over to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.\nWhen police initially interviewed Rossi, he claimed she raped him and threatened to have him killed.\nRossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before allegedly faking his death. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008.\nSchoenbaum writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "Colleges, K-12 schools ordered by Trump administration to abolish DEI or face funding cuts\n- Share via\n- The U.S. Department of Education has told schools and colleges to eliminate DEI programs or risk losing federal funding.\n- The decision covers race-related programs including financial aid, culturally themed dorm floors and graduation ceremonies.\n- Educators are scrambling to interpret the scope of the policy.\nThe U.S. Department of Education has given colleges and schools with race-specific programs \u2014 including financial aid and racially themed dormitory floors and graduation ceremonies \u2014 until the end of the month to abolish them or risk losing federal funding as educators scrambled over the holiday weekend to interpret the sweeping scope of new guidelines.\nThe \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter from the department\u2019s civil rights division and addressed to K-12 and higher education leaders lays out a new federal anti-discrimination enforcement policy that extends beyond the use of race in admissions, a practice barred since 2023 by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe guidelines, signed by acting assistant secretary for civil rights Craig Trainor, said schools using \u201crace in decisions pertaining to admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life\u201d were in violation of anti-discrimination laws and legal precedent set in the high court\u2019s affirmative action case.\nLawsuit accuses UC of giving racial preference in admissions to Black and Latino students\n\u201cThe department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this nation\u2019s educational institutions,\u201d the letter said. It later adds that federal education authorities will \u201cvigorously enforce the law on equal terms as to all preschool, elementary, secondary, and postsecondary educational institutions, as well as state educational agencies, that receive financial assistance.\u201d\nThe letter singles out \u201cwhite and Asian students, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds and low-income families,\u201d as victims of discrimination. It did not mention other types of school programming that appeal to nonracial groups, such as women-only residence halls, dorm room floors or programs for LGBTQ+ students or religious communities.\nA spokesman for the department did not reply Sunday to a request for comment.\nCalifornia received about $16.3 billion in total federal funding last year for its 5.8 million K-12 public school students, according to Education Data Initiative, which compiles information from government sources. The figures include education-related spending outside of the education department, such as school meal programs and Head Start for preschoolers. The letter did not say if the decision applies to funding that comes from beyond the department.\nAt the college level, more than $1.5 billion is allocated each year from the department to California students through Pell Grants, which do not have to be repaid and are given to students with low family incomes. In addition, more than $1 billion more is distributed throughout the country through other programs supporting low-income students.\nThe letter did not specify what type of federal funds for schools and colleges are at risk.\nEducation and legal experts said Sunday the department\u2019s guidance targets not only practices in which scholars agree that the use of race is illegal \u2014 admissions and hiring \u2014 but also those that are commonplace and often not controversial. They include scholarships aiding under-represented racial minorities, culturally themed dorm room floors and optional graduation ceremonies for Black, Latino, Native American and other college and high school groups.\nLinda McMahon, President Trump\u2019s education secretary nominee, wants to dismantle the department. What that means for California\u2019s K-12 funding, financial aid and student loans.\nShaun Harper, a USC professor of education, public policy and business, said the message \u2014 a sharp turn from educational civil rights enforcement under President Biden \u2014 is \u201cguaranteed to have a chilling effect.\u201d\nHe also questioned whether the Department of Education\u2019s letter, which cites the affirmative action case for a \u201cframework\u201d that \u201capplies more broadly\u201d beyond admissions, is legally sound.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court did not outlaw race-conscious campus programs and resources. Instead it ruled that race can\u2019t be used as a factor in determining admission,\u201d Harper said. \u201cHence, the dear colleague letter is interpretive overreach.\u201d\nCalifornia\u2019s Proposition 209, approved in 1996, barred all public educational institutions in the state from considering race in admissions. Private institutions, such as USC and Stanford, were also banned from the practice after the recent Supreme Court affirmative action ruling.\nBut other race-related campus programs have been widely in place for years at K-12 schools, colleges and universities.\nAt UCLA, the Black Bruin Resource Center launched in 2020 to \u201cuplift, support, and inspire the UCLA Black and African Diaspora Community.\u201d The campus also has a LatinX graduation \u2014 formerly Raza graduation \u2014 that started in 1973. At Cal State L.A., there\u2019s the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Student Achievement Program. Since 1972, USC has held its Latine Graduate Celebration. Websites for each say they are open to all students.\nThe department\u2019s notice called such graduation ceremonies \u201cshameful.\u201d\nIn a statement, the University of California indicated Sunday that it was not concerned about running afoul of the department.\nThe letter \u201cprovides guidance on the department\u2019s interpretation of existing anti-discrimination laws and does not name any specific institution,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt indicates how OCR [Office of Civil Rights] intends to enforce these legal requirements. Given the UC\u2019s compliance with Proposition 209, we do not use race-based preferences in our practices.\u201d\nIn a statement released Monday in response to the letter, the California State University Office of the Chancellor, which oversees the 23-campus system, called the department\u2019s action \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cWe are consulting with the California Attorney General and higher education partners across the country to better understand the statewide impact of this letter,\u201d the statement said.\nSpokespeople at USC and Stanford could not be reached for comment.\nMorgan Polikoff, a USC education professor, said he viewed the Trump administration\u2019s move as a \u201cpretext to go after universities.\u201d The letter, he said, went \u201cfar beyond\u201d the Harvard affirmative action case ruling. \u201cBut if it gets universities to change policies out of fear, they can accomplish a lot even if the argument of the dear colleague letter doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d\nEdward Blum, founder of Students for Fair Admissions \u2014 the organization that won its affirmative action lawsuit against Harvard two years ago in the Supreme Court ruling \u2014 said the department\u2019s message was an opening salvo in potential legal fights.\n\u201cThis letter is likely a prelude to a forthcoming series of detailed directives that will identify discriminatory policies and programs that will be challenged in federal court by the Education Department,\u201d Blum said. \u201cPublic and private educational institutions that have adopted policies that they consider race-neutral may soon have those policies declared as illegal race proxies.\u201d\nA day after a probe was opened into the CIF for allowing transgender athletes to play girls\u2019 sports, a federal judge blocked President Trump\u2019s executive orders restricting gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youths.\nK-12 schools and higher education institutions have been on alert since President Trump\u2019s inauguration over a host of issues affecting education, including executive orders on immigration enforcement and the role of transgender students in sports.\nThe president nominated former Small Business Administration administrator and wrestling executive Linda McMahon to be his education secretary and directed McMahon \u2014 whom the Senate has not confirmed \u2014 to \u201cput herself out of a job.\u201d\nTrump said he wants to eliminate the department. McMahon, during her confirmation hearing last week, said she and Trump \u201cwill be working with Congress\u201d to carry out that mission by \u201cpresenting a plan that I think our senators could get on board with and our Congress to get on board with.\u201d\nIf the department is dismantled, some of its functions may be transferred to other federal departments, including civil rights enforcement moving under the Justice Department.\nDuring her hearing, McMahon largely avoided giving specific answers about diversity, equity and inclusion while being questioned by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).\n\u201cWe are getting back to more segregating of our schools, instead of having more inclusion in our schools,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cWhen there are DEI programs that say that Black students need separate graduation ceremonies, or Hispanics need separate ceremonies, we are not achieving what we wanted to achieve with inclusion.\u201d\nMurphy mentioned that a West Point U.S. Military Academy Black engineers organization disbanded after a Trump executive order eliminated DEI in the federal government. He asked McMahon if public schools would risk funding over similar DEI programs structured around ethnic or racial affiliations.\n\u201cI certainly today don\u2019t want to address, you know, hypothetical situations. I would like, once I\u2019m confirmed, to get in and assess these programs, look at what has been covered,\u201d McMahon said.\nThe Department of Education released its DEI letter the next day."

      "text": "How California schools, colleges are responding to Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown\n- Share via\n- The U.S Department of Education has set a Friday deadline for K-12 schools, colleges and universities to eliminate race-specific programming or face potential federal funding cuts.\n- California public universities and many K-12 school systems are defending diversity efforts while carefully avoiding clashes with the administration.\n- Debate has ensued over the future of such programs.\nWith educators facing a federal deadline to abolish race-specific programs or risk funding cuts, California public universities and schools are defending diversity efforts while carefully avoiding clashes with the Trump administration, prompting confusion over the future of traditions including culturally themed dorm floors, Black student graduation ceremonies and scholarships for Latinos.\nIn a Feb. 14 letter, the U.S. Department of Education told all K-12 school districts and higher education institutions to end the use of race in \u201cadmissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life.\u201d It laid out a new federal anti-discrimination enforcement policy, threatening to pull federal dollars from schools that do not fall in line.\nThe response from many leaders of California universities and schools? Cautious and judiciously worded statements.\nSo far, the state\u2019s public university systems have not ordered affinity clubs or programming to shut down. Culturally themed dorms still exist. Scholarships have not been rescinded. And, leaders said, they already adhere to California law that banned using race as a factor in admissions under voter-approved Proposition 209.\nSchools are on alert after the Department of Education said it would cut federal funding unless they abolished diversity, equity and inclusion programs, potentially including culturally themed campus housing and graduation ceremonies.\nUniversity of California President Michael V. Drake, in a letter to all campuses last week, said the system follows state anti-discrimination law and would \u201cevaluate the potential impact\u201d of the Department of Education\u2019s letter. \u201cWe encourage UC staff to continue with their work in alignment with all applicable state and federal laws,\u201d Drake said.\nThe letter was followed by a video message Friday from UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk. \u201cOur mission has not changed and neither have our values,\u201d he said, adding that senior leaders would host a town hall this week to address a time of \u201cuncertainty\u201d under a \u201cbarrage\u201d of White House moves, including those on diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a feeling of uncertainty for many in our community right now, and uncertainty can bring fear.... Many across our state are feeling worried and unsettled,\u201d Frenk said.\nThe office of Chancellor Mildred Garc\u00eda of the 23-campus California State University system also issued a brief statement saying that it was \u201caware of the recent letter\u201d from the Department of Education on DEI issues. \u201cAs this type of action is unprecedented, we are consulting with the California Attorney General and higher education partners across the country to better understand the statewide impact of this letter.\u201d\nIn an interview, Cal State L.A. President Berenecea Johnson Eanes said: \u201cThe complexity of our conversation in this country around diversity, equity and inclusion will continue to be something that we will have to manage as a community.\u201d\nThe California Department of Education and the State Board of Education, which guides the state\u2019s 1,000 K-12 school districts, also issued a brief and limited statement:\n\u201cFederal laws regarding public education remain unchanged,\u201d it said, while advising school administrators and boards to \u201cconsult legal counsel regarding the impact of any potential federal actions.\u201d\nLinda McMahon, President Trump\u2019s education secretary nominee, wants to dismantle the department. What that means for California\u2019s K-12 funding, financial aid and student loans.\nL.A. Unified, the nation\u2019s second largest school district, has not changed its policies or practices related to a wide range of extracurricular school-based clubs. Among about 60 listed student groups at Garfield High in East L.A., for example, are the Asian-Pacific Islander Student Union, the Black Student Union, the Vietnamese Student Assn., Razas Unidas and the Gender Sexuality Alliance.\nL.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho said the district will review any changes in existing law and will continue to rely on legal support and advice from state officials including Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta and the state Department of Education. The district\u2019s legal staff also is monitoring developments, he said.\nCalifornia receives billions in federal funding each year. The money supports lower-income college students through Pell Grants and other scholarship programs, public school students with disabilities, Head Start for preschool, and meal programs, among other expenditures.\nAsked about what will happen after Friday\u2019s deadline, the Department of Education\u2019s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cadditional guidance on implementation is forthcoming.\u201d\nThe letter, which Trainor signed, did not specify what kind or how much funding is at risk. Experts said taking federal dollars away for violating Trump administration directives on race would be a drawn-out process bound to face legal challenges.\nSchool leaders nationwide are grappling with how to respond.\nTensions on campus\nMany in leadership positions \u201care hunkering down, saying, \u2018Let\u2019s not be the first target,\u2019\u201d said Ariela Gross, a professor at UCLA who focuses on race and law.\nGross is among two dozen law professors who signed a legal analysis sent to more than 100 universities unpacking how \u201cDEI initiatives remain legally defensible\u201d amid broader federal attacks on diversity programs. In an interview, Gross said the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s letter was an \u201cextremely broad and deeply incorrect interpretation of what discrimination and anti-discrimination mean.\u201d\n\u201cStill, it is causing confusion and concern,\u201d she said.\nOn her campus, programming around race abounds. The university advertises more than a dozen scholarships focused on minority groups, many sponsored by outside benefactors. Undergraduate dorms have \u201cliving learning communities\u201d where Black, Latino, Native American and Asian American students can apply for housing or visit to study or attend events \u2014 that are open to all races. Each spring, optional \u201cAfro Grad\u201d and \u201cLatinx Graduation\u201d ceremonies take place on the Westwood campus. They are also open to all.\nA day after a probe was opened into the CIF for allowing transgender athletes to play girls\u2019 sports, a federal judge blocked President Trump\u2019s executive orders restricting gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youths.\nAfter reading the federal memo, Alex Davis, a UCLA PhD candidate in political science who also attended the university as an undergraduate, called it \u201cworrisome.\u201d\n\u201cIf they go by this definition of DEI, it basically applies to the majority of what made my undergraduate experience great,\u201d said Davis, who is Black.\nThat includes the Afrikan Diaspora Community, part of the Rieber Hall dorm, where Black students live and host cultural events. Davis didn\u2019t live there but would frequently visit as an undergraduate for Black film nights, among other programs.\nShe wondered whether the Black Bruin Resource Center, a community support space she helped found as an undergraduate, would be considered a violation by the Department of Education. A former chairperson of the Afrikan Student Union, Davis also participated in the McNair Research Scholars Program, a fellowship that supports students of diverse backgrounds to help prepare them to apply for graduate and PhD programs.\n\u201cThis all feels like a backlash to the movement for Black lives and all the progress we had made just a few years ago,\u201d Davis said.\nAt USC, where race-related clubs, dorm communities, graduation events and scholarships have been a part of campus life for years, students and staff have debated whether there will be changes.\nThe university has not issued any public statements. A spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter.\nAt UC Riverside, Abby Choy, a senior who participates in Asian American programs, including a Chinese martial arts club, said she found the anti-DEI letter \u201csilly.\u201d\n\u201cHow would I enjoy college if I couldn\u2019t celebrate my culture and had to suppress it?\u201d said Choy, who plans to attend the campus\u2019 second annual Asian American Pacific Islander graduation ceremony in the spring.\nLawsuit accuses UC of giving racial preference in admissions to Black and Latino students\n\u201cMy parents are immigrants and I\u2019m the first generation to go to college,\u201d Choy said. \u201cThere is such a different feeling in seeing your own people graduate together onstage.\u201d\nSof\u00eda Jimenez, a UC Riverside sophomore who is Latina and Indigenous, said her friends frequently talk about federal efforts to dismantle DEI.\n\u201cA lot of people think these issues are solved. But they are not. We still need resources and opportunities for us,\u201d said Jimenez, who is part of the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztl\u00e1n, or MEChA, and has attended Native American campus events.\n\u201cThe administration says this is racial segregation? It is not. We never keep people separate or kick them out. It\u2019s about sharing our cultures,\u201d she said.\nConservative views\nThe Trump administration\u2019s move has been hailed by education leaders in Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana and other conservative-led states \u2014 as well as conservative-led California school systems.\nIn a statement, Megan Degenfelder, superintendent of public instruction for the Wyoming Department of Education, praised the move \u201cto eliminate discrimination.\u201d\n\u201cUniversities, colleges, and K-12 schools have used discriminatory practices throughout their operations \u2014from hiring and training employees, to admissions and scholarships, and even in human resources and classroom instruction,\u201d she said.\nSome say the Department of Education\u2019s letter is an extension of Biden administration guidance. In 2023, the department issued a letter to schools about nondiscrimination law that said it would be illegal to host an assembly, for example, for \u201cBlack students in order to provide a forum for them to express their frustrations, fears, and concerns\u201d if it excluded other racial groups.\nAt L.A. Unified, the district recently revised its Black Student Achievement Plan to be open to all students rather than just Black students. With that adjustment, the Biden administration concluded the program was in compliance with recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings.\nLAUSD quietly overhauled BSAP, a program meant to bolster struggling Black students, after a legal challenge from a conservative group against basing such help on race.\nBen Sheyman, a USC senior and member of the campus Republicans club, said he didn\u2019t believe \u201crace should be at the forefront of anything.\u201d\n\u201cRace is obviously important. But I think the focus comes at the expense of connecting with people who are different from you,\u201d Sheyman said. \u201cI thought college was about coming together in one space to be together and learn from each other. Not about separate graduations, separate dorm floors.\u201d\nEli Tsives, a UCLA sophomore, also celebrated anti-DEI initiatives \u2014 to a degree.\n\u201cDEI is dying. The Trump administration is going to kill it completely and I think that\u2019s a great thing. We need to go to, like Trump says, merit-based,\u201d said Tsives, who studies political science.\nBut Tsives drew a line between diversity programs in admissions, hiring or promotion and areas such as dorm room programming and graduation events.\n\u201cLet the Black students have their own graduation. Let Hispanics have their own graduation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hurting anyone.\u201d\nSonja Shaw, the conservative president of the Chino Valley Unified school board who has become a national figure for her pro-Trump positions, said she approved of the department\u2019s guidance.\n\u201cMuch of what has been outlined in recent executive orders aligns with policies we\u2019ve already been implementing in our district \u2014 because we actually listen to parents, not political elites,\u201d Shaw said.\nLegal questions\nThe Department of Education letter explained its view on what counts as discrimination by citing a 2023 Supreme Court case that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions. But some scholars say the reading goes too far.\n\u201cIt\u2019s far more sweeping than anything in the Supreme Court case, which was only about admissions. But this letter applies it broadly to all levels of education and all aspects of campus life,\u201d said Gross, the UCLA law professor. The department, she said, \u201cappears to directly contradict\u201d the court case, in which Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said \u201cstudents could talk about their experiences of being human beings with racial identities as part of their essays. One can\u2019t possibly outlaw people reflecting on their own experiences.\u201d\nPedro Noguera, dean of the USC Rossier School of Education, described the federal directive as \u201coverreach\u201d that is likely to be challenged in court.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so simple that you can have a memo go out and think that everyone is going to fall into line,\u201d Noguera said.\nTrump\u2019s executive order calling on campuses to address antisemitism has university leaders, faculty and students concerned as the president vows to revoke visas of pro-Palestinian international students who have taken part in protests.\nThomas Saenz, who is president and general counsel of MALDEF, a Latino civil rights organization, said the anti-DEI initiative was \u201call about fear and intimidation.\u201d\nHe pointed out an assertion in the Department of Education\u2019s letter about standardized testing. The letter states that \u201cit would, for instance, be unlawful for an educational institution to eliminate standardized testing to achieve a desired racial balance or to increase racial diversity.\u201d\nThe claim, Saenz said, is false. \u201cThere is absolutely nothing in the law that would prevent abandoning standardized tests for any reason, including that they have continuing discriminatory effects.\u201d\nUC and CSU have eliminated standardized testing for admissions after years of research, concluding that high school grades are a better tool without the biases related to race, income and parental education levels found in tests.\nSeveral LAUSD leaders said they were ready to resist the federal department\u2019s instructions.\n\u201cI\u2019m offended but not surprised that the administration seems to have no concept of what students of color have experienced historically and today in this country,\u201d said board member Tanya Ortiz Franklin.\n\u201cMy colleagues and I don\u2019t believe social justice and equity are \u2018nebulous goals\u2019 but rather they represent the true ideals of democracy and freedom,\u201d she said.\nSupt. Carvalho said district needs to be \u201cwatchful\u201d as federal education decisions collide with state and local schooling authorities.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with superintendents across the country who represent disproportionately urban poor districts, very, very diverse, with large concentrations of immigrant students, and we are concerned about the growing distance between state protective policies and what we hear is the intent of upcoming federal policies,\u201d he said last week during an event at White Middle School in Carson with Rep. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n (D-San Pedro) to oppose the proposed dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education.\n\u201cSchool districts need support and protection from their state. I think we\u2019re getting that here in California, but we need to continue to be very watchful,\u201d Carvalho added in an interview.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a comfortable position to be in as a school leader in a district, if your state does not have your back.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Daniel Miller contributed to this report."

Gen. Pam Bondi said in a social media post Thursday.\nA video of Sean Charles Dunn berating a group of federal agents late Sunday went viral online. Dunn was arrested on an assault charge after he threw a \u201csub-style\u201d sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent, a court filing said.\nDunn, 37, of Washington, was an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, according to a department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter.\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d Bondi wrote. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nA multiagency flood of uniformed federal law enforcement officers had fanned out across the city over the weekend after the White House had announced stepped-up measures to combat crime. That was before President Trump\u2019s announcement Monday that he was taking over Washington\u2019s police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard.\nThe Justice Department still employs a former FBI agent who was charged with joining a mob\u2019s attack on the U.S. Capitol and cheering on rioters during the Jan. 6, 2021, siege, repeatedly yelling, \u201cKill \u2018em!\u201d as they attacked police. The former FBI supervisory agent, Jared Lane Wise, is serving as a counselor to Justice Department pardon attorney Ed Martin Jr., who was a leading figure in Trump\u2019s campaign to overturn the 2020 election.\nAround 11 p.m. on Sunday, Dunn approached a group of CBP agents, pointed a finger in an agent\u2019s face and swore at him, calling him a \u201cfascist,\u201d a police affidavit says. An observer\u2019s video captured Dunn throwing a sandwich at the agent\u2019s chest, the affidavit says.\n\u201cWhy are you here?
