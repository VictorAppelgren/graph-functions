  "description": "Key PointsInternational money transfers desperately need modernization, giving RippleNet a massive long-term opportunity.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None At the same time, XRP's $168 billion market cap looks expensive when RippleNet only generates a tiny trickle of annual fees.\n\u2022 None XRP needs a price correction before it becomes an attractive investment opportunity again.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than XRP \u203a\n\nThe XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) cryptocurrency, formerly known as Ripple, has been volatile in 2025. Its price per coin has swung as high as $3.56 and as low as $1.79 this year. The XRP chart currently sits at $2.97, just above the midpoint of that wild range.\n\nThis volatility follows on the heels of skyrocketing gains in 2024. On the afternoon of Aug. 29, XRP was up 421% in 52 weeks.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nDoes XRP have room to go higher before the end of 2025, or is it more likely to see a price cut by the end of the year? Let's think about that.\n\nSome crypto market watchers expect XRP to soar in the near future. Bullish catalysts include the XRP-based RLUSD (CRYPTO: RLUSD) stablecoin, the pending approval of the first XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the general trend of higher prices in recent months.\n\nThe crypto-friendly Trump administration plays a part in this rosy view, and for good reason: XRP would probably still be wrestling with its old Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit if November's presidential election had gone the other way.\n\nOthers see a precarious pricing situation, since XRP's $168 billion market cap isn't supported by a booming business. On Thursday, for instance, the RippleNet international payment system settled 674,000 transactions worth a total of $713 million. Not too shabby, at least when you extrapolate these figures to a dollar volume of roughly $260 billion and 260 million payments per year.\n\nBut RippleNet only collected 691 XRP tokens in fees, worth a total of approximately $1,900. That's just above $706,000 per year. That's...not a lot.\n\nI'm sure the business collects revenue in other ways, but Ripple is still a private organization and tight-lipped about its finances. Based on the ultra-modest XRP fees, however, the crypto's $168 billion market cap doesn't look so cheap anymore.\n\nThe real-world problem XRP is trying to solve\n\nI see a bright long-term future for RippleNet and XRP. Border-crossing payments are a very big business, and the solutions you see in traditional banking systems are often pricey and slow. If there ever were a financial service in need of a modern digital overhaul, international payments would be at the top of my list.\n\nI say this as a natural-born Swede who relocated to America nearly 30 years ago. Sending money to friends and family in the land of the Vikings, Volvos, and IKEA was never quick or easy.\n\nGetting paid for writing and translation services abroad is also costly and surprisingly slow. This is particularly shocking since Sweden has pretty much done away with old-school coins and bills already. Most retailers strongly prefer electronic payment options like credit cards, PayPal, the local Swish e-banking service, or pay-later options such as Stockholm-based Klarna.\n\nBureaucracy, paperwork, and high fees for international payments just don't make sense against that smooth, swift, and digital framework. Yet, that's the situation. Modern alternatives like XRP could clean this mess up over time.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch (or four)\n\nBut that's the issue: Big changes take a lot of time. XRP might handle trillion-dollar payment volumes someday, possibly generating significant revenue along the way. But that's a long-term vision with many potential pitfalls. For example:\n\u2022 Other cryptocurrencies could steal XRP's thunder. Stablecoins and central bank digital currencies are particularly likely challengers.\n\u2022 Old-school banks could get their digital ducks in a row, collaborating to develop their own digital ledger system for international trade.\n\u2022 Regulations on border-crossing money movements could harmonize on a global level. The intricacies of working with unique regulations in nearly 200 countries are a large part of RippleNet's first-mover advantage, so a unified worldwide rulebook would be a game-changer.\n\u2022 The RippleNet service and XRP cryptocurrency are fast, but can they handle a true case of global success with billions of potential users?\n\nSo, it's far from a risk-free process. Sure, XRP could become a huge winner in the long haul, but it could also stumble and fall long before becoming a household name everywhere.\n\nThe incredibly generous price premium you see today is a bit much. If anything, XRP could use a quick price correction to account for a plethora of business risks.\n\nI don't expect that correction to happen in 2025, for the same change-averse reasons that are slowing down XRP's financial victory march. Volatility will continue, and the crypto's story will be told for years to come. A small XRP investment could be appropriate at this point, keeping you connected to its developing business case, but I would not recommend big bets on it now.\n\nAsk again if that hair-raising price correction shows up. I might be an XRP buyer again at that point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in XRP right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and XRP wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $651,599!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,067,639!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,049% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nAnders Bylund has positions in XRP. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends PayPal and XRP.

      "text": "A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a digital version of government-backed, fiat money. This type of digital currency is issued by a central bank and tied to the country's national currency.\nCBDCs are most similar to stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to fiat money and attempt to maintain the same value. The main difference is that the world's governments issue CBDCs.\nMore than 80 countries around the world are researching or developing CBDCs, and they're at various stages of the process. Some have inactive or canceled projects, while others have already launched their digital currencies. Since CBDCs could affect the crypto market, understanding them is important if you're investing in cryptocurrency.\nHow does it work?\nHow does central bank digital currency (CBDC) work?\nEach CBDC is a digital representation of a country's existing fiat money, and it works the same way. Since many countries are working on their own CBDCs, there will likely be differences in how they work, but they follow the same basic model.\nThe country's central bank issues its CBDC, which has the backing of the federal government. That CBDC can then be used as legal tender for transactions such as paying employees or buying goods and services.\nThis may sound familiar to what we already have. After all, you can transfer money from your bank account to a friend's account at another bank, and it will all happen digitally. However, with a CBDC, this type of transaction wouldn't need to pass through multiple banks and take several business days. It could all happen nearly instantaneously on one digital ledger.\nConsumers also wouldn't need a commercial bank account to use a CBDC. For those who are unbanked, CBDCs would provide a way to transfer money digitally.\nTypes of CBDCs\nTypes of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)\nThere are two types of CBDCs: retail and wholesale, as well as hybrids that combine elements of the two. Here's what makes these different and how they work.\nRetail central bank digital currencies\nRetail CBDCs are issued to the general public. Under this model, consumers are able to own a CBDC in a wallet or account and use it for payments.\nThis type of CBDC would serve as a public digital banking option that anyone can use. It could be especially helpful for consumers who can't access traditional banking services. There's also no risk of a bank failure since the funds are backed by the government.\nQuite a few countries have chosen to pursue the retail CBDC model, including the U.S. The Bahamas, which was the first country to launch a widely available CBDC, also chose the retail model.\nWholesale central bank digital currencies\nWholesale CBDCs would be used by financial institutions. Banks and other financial institutions could use a central bank's CBDC to transfer funds and settle transactions more quickly. While this type of CBDC would improve efficiency for domestic payments, it could also be very useful for cross-border payments.\nAnother benefit of a wholesale CBDC is improved security. The digital ledger these currencies use to process and record transactions could help prevent banking fraud.\nA few countries are focused on a wholesale CBDC, including Singapore, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. But most are developing either a retail or hybrid CBDC.\nPros and Cons\nPros and cons to CBDCs\nHere are the biggest pros and cons of CBDCs:\n| Pros | Cons |\n|---|---|\n| More efficient and secure payments. | Central banks have complete control. |\n| Allow consumers to use central bank directly. | Less privacy for users. |\n| Eliminate risk of a commercial bank collapse. | Difficult to attain widespread adoption. |\n| Easy to track. | Possible competition between central and commercial banks. |\nSource: Author.\nThere are several advantages to countries implementing their own CBDCs, including:\n- A CBDC could lead to transactions that are much faster, cheaper, and more secure, which benefits everyone involved.\n- In countries that create retail CBDCs, consumers can get direct access to central bank funds. Many countries have large unbanked populations, and CBDCs could help solve this problem.\n- Consumers wouldn't need to risk storing their money with a commercial bank that could potentially collapse. As long as their country's central bank is stable, their funds are safe.\n- Since all CBDC transactions are recorded on a digital ledger, money is much easier to track this way. That could help authorities detect fraud and other illicit activities.\nOn the other hand, there are also several potential drawbacks to CBDCs:\n- A country's central bank would have full control over its CBDC. The central bank could, theoretically, decide to put restrictions on the types of transactions it allows.\n- The central bank would have data on every transaction and at least some data on the CBDC's users. Anytime a large organization has so much user data, there's the potential for privacy issues.\n- It will take time for CBDCs to catch on. Some members of the population won't have the means to access digital currencies. Others may be reluctant because they don't trust digital currencies.\n- If consumers have access to retail CBDCs, commercial banks could lose a significant portion of their business. This would be bad for banks and could also impact the stock market since bank stocks could drop in value.\nCBDC vs. cryptocurrency\nCBDCs are not cryptocurrencies. Although the idea for CBDCs came from cryptocurrencies, they are two very different types of digital currencies.\nThe key difference between CBDCs and cryptocurrency is centralization. A cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency, meaning there's no central party that controls it. Transactions are processed and recorded on a blockchain, which is a public, distributed ledger. As the name implies, a central bank digital currency is controlled by a central bank.\nCryptocurrency also provides much greater privacy than CBDCs. Transactions are sent and received through wallet addresses, and it's possible to retain some degree of anonymity. Certain types of cryptocurrency are even thought to be untraceable. With a CBDC, the central bank will have a record of users and their transactions.\nExamples\nExamples of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)\nMost CBDCs are in the research or development stage, but there are a few that have launched. Here are some examples of CBDCs that are either available or being tested in different countries:\n- The Bahamas has launched the Sand Dollar, a digital version of the Bahamian dollar. It's issued by the Central Bank of the Bahamas through authorized financial institutions.\n- China is testing a digital yuan, also known as the digital renminbi or digital RMB. Among countries with the largest economies, China has gotten the furthest in developing its CBDC.\n- Nigeria is rolling out the eNaira, which records transactions on a centralized blockchain ledger. It's the first African nation to launch a CBDC.\nThe U.S. is researching the costs and benefits of launching a CBDC, but, of the nations with the largest banks, it's the furthest behind, according to the Atlantic Council.\nWe're still in the early phases of CBDCs, but it's clearly an idea that's catching on. The countries that are exploring them represent more than 90% of the world's total gross domestic product (GDP). While CBDCs may not entirely replace cash, we'll likely see most countries at least implement their own digital currencies in some way."

      "text": "You may wonder what makes cryptocurrency valuable, given that it's notoriously volatile. It's not uncommon for Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) to increase or decrease in price by 5% or even 10% on any given day. Smaller cryptocurrencies can have even wider price swings.\nAfter reading this article, you'll have a better understanding of what makes cryptocurrency valuable and why the price might swing violently within a single day.\nUnderstanding the value of a cryptocurrency\nUnderstanding the value of a cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrencies usually aren't backed by any central authority in the same fashion as fiat currencies or another government-sanctioned medium of exchange. Government backing can improve faith in the value of a currency among consumers, and it provides a big spender and collector of the currency. (Try paying your taxes in Bitcoin.) But since cryptocurrencies are generally decentralized, they derive their value from other sources, including:\n- Supply and demand\n- Cost of production\n- Availability on exchanges\n- Competition\n- Governance\n- Regulations\nLaw of Supply and Demand\nCryptocurrency supply and demand\nCryptocurrency supply and demand\nThe value of cryptocurrency is determined by supply and demand, just like anything else that people want. If demand increases faster than supply, the price goes up. For example, if there's a drought, the price of grain and produce increases if demand doesn't change. The same supply and demand principle applies to cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency gains value when demand rises higher than supply.\nThe supply mechanism of a cryptocurrency is always known; each crypto publishes its token minting and burning plans. Some, such as Bitcoin, have a fixed maximum supply; we know that there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. Others, like Ether (CRYPTO:ETH), have no cap on supply. Some cryptocurrencies have mechanisms that \"burn\" existing tokens to prevent the circulating supply from growing too large and slowing inflation. Burning a token means sending them to an unrecoverable address on the blockchain.\nThe monetary policy of each cryptocurrency is different. Bitcoin supply increases by a fixed amount with each new block mined on the blockchain. Ethereum offers a fixed reward per block mined, but it also pays out for including \"uncle blocks\" in the new block, which helps facilitate the efficiency of the blockchain. As a result, the supply increase isn't as fixed. Some cryptocurrency supplies are dictated entirely by the team in charge of a project, which can opt to release more of a token to the public or burn tokens to manage the money supply.\nDemand can increase as a project gains awareness or as utility increases. Broader adoption of a cryptocurrency as an investment also increases demand while effectively limiting the circulating supply. For example, when institutional investors started buying and holding Bitcoin in early 2021, the price of Bitcoin increased significantly as demand outstripped the pace at which new coins were created, effectively decreasing the total available supply of Bitcoin.\nLikewise, as more decentralized finance (DeFi) projects launch on the Ethereum blockchain, the demand for Ether increases. Ether is required to perform transactions on the blockchain regardless of what cryptocurrency you're transacting with. Or, if a DeFi project takes off itself, its own token will become more useful, thereby increasing demand.\nCost of production\nCost of production\nNew cryptocurrency tokens are produced through a process called mining. Mining for cryptocurrency involves using a computer to verify the next block on the blockchain. The decentralized network of miners is what allows cryptocurrency to work as it does. In exchange, the protocol produces a reward in the form of cryptocurrency tokens, in addition to any fees paid by the exchanging parties to the miners.\nVerifying the blockchain requires computing power. Participants invest in expensive equipment and electricity in order to mine cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-work system, like those used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, the more competition there is for mining a certain cryptocurrency, the more difficult it is to mine. That's because miners essentially race each other to solve a complex math problem in order to verify a block. As such, the cost to mine increases as more powerful equipment is needed to successfully mine.\nAs mining costs increase, it necessitates an increased value of the cryptocurrency. Miners won't mine if the value of the currency they're mining isn't high enough to offset their costs. And, since miners are essential to making the blockchain function, as long as there's demand for using the blockchain, the price will have to go up.\nLiquidity Mining\nCryptocurrency exchanges\nCryptocurrency exchanges\nMainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether trade on multiple exchanges. Just about any cryptocurrency exchange will list the most popular tokens.\nBut some smaller tokens may only be available on select exchanges, thus limiting access for some investors. Some wallet providers will aggregate quotes for swapping any set of cryptocurrencies across several exchanges, but they'll take a fee for doing so, increasing the cost of investing. Furthermore, if a cryptocurrency is thinly traded on a small exchange, the spread the exchange takes may be too big for some investors.\nIf a cryptocurrency becomes listed on more exchanges, it can increase the number of investors willing and able to buy it, thus increasing demand. And, all else being equal, as demand increases, the price goes up.\nCompetition\nCompetition\nThere are thousands of different cryptocurrencies in existence, with new projects and tokens launching every day. The barrier to entry is relatively low for new competitors, but creating a viable cryptocurrency also relies on building a network of users of that cryptocurrency.\nA useful application on the blockchain can quickly build a network, especially if it improves upon a limitation of a competing application. If a new competitor gains momentum, it takes value from the existing competition, thus sending the price of the incumbent down as the new competitor's token sees its price move higher.\nInternal governance\nInternal governance\nCryptocurrency networks rarely abide by a static set of rules. Developers adapt projects based on the community that uses them. Some tokens -- called governance tokens -- give their holders a say in the future of a project, including how a token is mined or used. In order to make any changes to the governance of a token, there needs to be consensus among stakeholders.\nFor example, Ethereum is working to update its network from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system, effectively rendering much of the expensive mining equipment in data centers or people's basements useless. That will undoubtedly have an impact on the value of Ether.\nGenerally speaking, investors like stable governance. Even if there are flaws in the way a cryptocurrency operates, investors prefer the devil they know to the devil they don't. As such, stable governance where things are relatively hard to change can be of value by providing more stable pricing.\nOn the other hand, the slow process of updating software to improve protocols can limit the upside of cryptocurrency values. If an update would unlock value for cryptocurrency holders but takes months to execute, it hurts the current stakeholders.\nRegulations and legal requirements\nRegulations and legal requirements\nThere's some confusion about who should regulate the exchange of cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says cryptocurrencies are securities like stocks and bonds, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) says they're commodities like coffee or gold.\nBoth can't claim regulatory authority over cryptocurrency exchanges. A determining ruling could provide greater clarity and improve cryptocurrency values while opening the door for more widely traded crypto-related financial products.\nRegulation is required to allow for easier ways to trade cryptocurrency. Products such as ETFs or futures contracts provide more access to cryptocurrency for investors, increasing its value. Additionally, regulation could enable investors to take short positions or bet against the price of cryptocurrencies with futures contracts or options. That should produce better price discovery and reduce the volatility of cryptocurrency pricing.\nRegulations could also negatively impact demand for cryptocurrency. If a governing body changes the rules to disfavor cryptocurrency investment or use, it could send the price of cryptocurrencies lower.\nRelated Crypto Topics\nFinding value in cryptocurrency\nFinding value in cryptocurrency\nIf you understand the core principle of supply and demand behind what gives cryptocurrency value and the factors influencing them, you can make better cryptocurrency investment decisions. If you believe demand is going to increase for reasons X, Y, and Z and don't think supply will keep up, that cryptocurrency could be a good investment. But be aware that governments still don't have best practices for regulating cryptocurrency, which makes it a particularly risky and volatile investment no matter what."

      "text": "Klarna is leading the generational shift away from credit cards. The Swedish company specializes in making buy now, pay later (BNPL) consumer loans. It has also been an early leader in using artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate its mission of revolutionizing the consumer-facing banking sector.\nThe company has quickly built out a global payment network and shopping assistant. It launched in 2005 and has grown to support 93 million active customers and more than 675,000 merchants across 26 countries. Its platform handles 2.9 million transactions per day. Klarna's strategy has drawn some of the biggest venture capital and financial firms to become early investors in its financial technology platform.\nThese factors have made Klarna a widely anticipated initial public offering (IPO). Here's a guide to everything you need to know about how to invest in Klarna ahead of its eventual initial public offering (IPO).\nIs it publicly traded?\nIs Klarna publicly traded?\nKlarna wasn't a publicly traded company as of early 2025. The financial technology company is privately held and has the backing of some of the biggest names in venture capital and finance, including Sequoia, Silver Lake, and Visa (V 0.59%).\nIPO\nWhen it will IPO\nWhen will Klarna IPO?\nKlarna had been working to put its IPO on the calendar in early 2025. However, the company paused its IPO plans following President Donald Trump's decision to levy sweeping tariffs, which caused significant market volatility. The company said it would reassess its plans if market conditions stabilize.\nHow to invest\nHow to buy Klarna stock\nBecause Klarna still hasn't completed an IPO, investors can't buy shares of the financial technology company in their brokerage account.\nHowever, accredited investors (i.e., high-net-worth individuals or those with high incomes) can sometimes buy pre-IPO shares of companies like Klarna on secondary platforms such as Equity Bee or Forge Global. Accredited investors who really want to get in ahead of its IPO should check out those platforms to see if they have shares of Klarna available to buy.\nNon-accredited investors will need to continue waiting until the company launches its IPO. In the meantime, those interested in the financial technology trend could invest in one of Klarna's publicly traded competitors. Here are three options to consider:\n1. Affirm Holdings\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM 10.59%) is a buy now, pay later (BNPL) leader. The company sets itself apart from competitors like Klarna by not charging customers any fees, including late fees. It has two flexible repayment options: Pay in four (consumers make four interest-free payments every two weeks) and monthly payment plans (that do charge interest). Affirm had 21 million active customers in early 2025 and processed more than $31 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) on its platform over the past year.\n2. Block\nBlock (XYZ -1.39%), formerly Square, is a global financial technology company. It offers businesses several building blocks to help them grow, including Square and Cash App. Block accelerated its BNPL business in 2022 when it acquired Afterpay for $29 billion, which it integrated into Square and Cash App. The company's BNPL platform grew 19% in 2024 to $10.3 billion in GMV.\n3. PayPal Holdings\nPayPal (PYPL 0.13%) is a leading digital payments company. It has a diversified portfolio of financial technology tools and brands, including Honey, Venmo, and its namesake platform. The company launched its BNPL service in 2020. It also offers a pay-in-four option and monthly installment plans, giving consumers purchase flexibility.\nPeople who want to buy one of these Klarna competitors can purchase shares in any brokerage account. Here's a step-by-step guide to investing in these financial technology stocks.\n- Open your brokerage app: Log in to your brokerage account where you handle your investments.\n- Search for the stock: Enter the ticker or company name into the search bar to bring up the stock's trading page.\n- Decide how many shares to buy: Consider your investment goals and how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to this stock.\n- Select order type: Choose between a market order to buy at the current price or a limit order to specify the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n- Submit your order: Confirm the details and submit your buy order.\n- Review your purchase: Check your portfolio to ensure your order was filled as expected and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nInvestors would follow a similar process to buy an IPO stock like Klarna when it goes public. Once shares become available, select Klarna's chosen stock ticker to buy shares through your brokerage account.\nProfitability\nIs Klarna profitable?\nEven though Klarna is a private company, it publicly reports some of its financial results. The company gave investors a glimpse at its results as it prepared to go public in early 2025.\nKlarna reported $2.8 billion of revenue in 2024, a 24% increase from the prior year. Meanwhile, the company turned the corner on profitability, posting $21 million in net income. That was a significant improvement from the $244 million loss it reported in 2023 on $2.3 billion of revenue.\nIn addition to revenue growth, a driver of the company's improved profitability was a reduction in its headcount. Klarna is leveraging the power of AI to focus its remaining employees on what really matters in driving its mission.\nReaching profitability is important for Klarna. Companies that grow their earnings tend to create the most value for investors over the long term.\nShould you invest?\nShould I invest in Klarna?\nKlarna isn't public yet. However, it's gearing up for an IPO, which could happen in the coming year. That gives investors some time to research the company before buying shares.\nResearch is an important step that investors won't want to skip. It could increase your conviction that the stock is worth buying. However, you also might uncover something in your research that changes your mind about buying the stock.\nWith that in mind, here are some reasons why you might want to buy shares of Klarna when it goes public:\n- You're a fan of the company and use its services.\n- You think it can disrupt the credit card and financial services industries.\n- You think Klarna can continue growing its revenue briskly and eventually start producing sustainable profits.\n- You believe Klarna can keep its competitors at bay.\n- You prefer to invest in founder-led companies.\n- You're excited that Klarna is embracing artificial intelligence to enhance its products.\n- You think the company trades at a much more enticing valuation following a big decline in its private market value between its last two funding rounds.\nOn the other hand, here are some reasons why Klarna might not be the right choice for your portfolio:\n- You don't use BNPL products.\n- You prefer one of Klarna's competitors.\n- You're concerned about there being too much competition in the BNPL space.\n- You're worried that a recession could significantly affect Klarna's growth and profitability.\n- You're not sure Klarna can become consistently profitable.\nETFs\nETFs with exposure to Klarna\nSince Klarna is still a privately held company, investors can't gain passive exposure to its stock by investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\nHowever, those interested in investing in the financial technology sector can consider an ETF focused on that theme. Here are a couple of financial technology-focused ETFs to consider:\n- ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF -1.07%): This ETF is actively managed (by the well-known Cathie Wood) and focused on the financial technology innovation theme. It generally holds 35 to 55 companies. Block was one of its largest holdings in early 2025, at 4.5% of the fund's total. The fund had a 0.75% ETF expense ratio.\n- GlobalX FinTech ETF (NYSEMKT:FINX): The passively managed fund focuses on companies in the emerging financial technology sector. The fund had 63 holdings as of early 2025, including PayPal at 6.1% of the fund's total assets and Block (4.5%). It had a total expense ratio of 0.68%.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line\nThe bottom line on Klarna\nKlarna aims to revolutionize the retail banking sector. It offers customers BNPL options as an alternative to credit cards and is an early adopter of AI to improve its offerings. It's growing fast and is on the cusp of sustainable profitability. These features make it one of the most anticipated upcoming IPOs. Its continued growth could send its shares soaring after it goes public.\nFAQs\nInvesting in Klarna FAQs\nWhat is the stock symbol for Klarna?\nKlarna was still a privately held company as of early 2025, so it didn't trade on major stock exchanges or have a stock ticker symbol yet. However, the company had filed to go public in early 2025 under the stock ticker KLAR, though its IPO was on pause due to tariff-related market volatility.\nShould you invest in Klarna?\nKlarna has a lot of attractive investment characteristics. The founder-led company is growing fast and disrupting the traditional banking industry. It's also getting close to reaching sustained profitability. Meanwhile, its valuation has decreased significantly from its lofty peak in 2021. If these factors still hold true when Klarna goes public, it might be a stock that investors should consider buying.\nIs Klarna private or public?\nKlarna was still a privately held company as of early 2025. Although it's ready to go public (it filed for an IPO in 2025), the company had paused its IPO due to market volatility related to tariffs. It's currently waiting for market conditions to improve before moving forward with an IPO.\nWhat is the value of Klarna?\nKlarna last raised money from investors in July 2022. It brought in $800 million of new financing at a $6.7 billion post-money value. That was significantly less than its June 2021 valuation of $45.6 billion.\nThe company was seeking to go public in early 2025, aiming to raise $1 billion via an IPO. That would have put Klarna's value at roughly $15 billion. However, it paused plans to go public due to market volatility, suggesting it didn't think it could achieve that valuation."

      "text": "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that aim to peg their value to another asset, most often a fiat currency. For example, a U.S. dollar stablecoin is designed to maintain a value of $1. Since most cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, stablecoins are an alternative for those who want a digital currency with a fixed value.\nIt's a common misconception that stablecoins are safe and can be counted on to maintain the intended value. Although that's the goal, they can lose their pegs, so they're not risk-free. Stablecoins serve a key role in the crypto market, but before you buy any, it's important to understand how they work.\nTypes of stablecoins\nTypes of stablecoins\nThere are four types of stablecoins:\n- Fiat-backed stablecoins\n- Crypto-backed stablecoins\n- Commodity-backed stablecoins\n- Algorithmic stablecoins\nAs you can see, it's the backing or collateral that determines the type of stablecoin. You'll find more details on each type below.\nFiat-backed stablecoins\nFiat-backed stablecoins have a fiat currency reserve. The reserves are collateral that guarantee the value of the stablecoin and should be equal in value to the circulating supply. For example, a fiat-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin with 1 million coins in circulation should have $1 million in reserves.\nThis type of stablecoin is normally safe if the organization managing it has sufficient reserves. To verify its reserves, the organization should provide regular audits by an independent third party.\nFiat Currency\nCrypto-backed stablecoins\nCrypto-backed stablecoins have cryptocurrency reserves. They generally use one of the larger cryptocurrencies as collateral, such as Bitcoin (BTC 0.12%) or Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH).\nSince cryptocurrencies are volatile, this type of stablecoin needs to be over-collateralized. Its reserves should be significantly greater in value than its circulating supply to account for price fluctuations.\nCommodity-backed stablecoins\nCommodity-backed stablecoins have reserves made up of physical assets, such as precious metals, real estate, and oil. The most common type of commodities used to back stablecoins are precious metals, specifically gold.\nThis type of stablecoin is pegged to its reserve asset. For example, a gold-backed stablecoin would be pegged to the value of gold. The advantage for investors is that they can purchase digital versions of commodities without needing to obtain or store the actual physical asset.\nAlgorithmic stablecoins\nAlgorithmic stablecoins control the circulating supply using algorithms and smart contracts. They may not have reserves, and, if they do, they're typically under-collateralized. Algorithms reduce the supply if the stablecoin's price is lower than the asset it tracks and mint more coins if it's higher. It's similar to how central banks operate by printing and destroying fiat money.\nThese stablecoins are riskier because they don't have sufficient reserves to dip into if they face issues. TerraUSD (USTC 1.4%) is a famous example of how this can go wrong. This algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg in May 2022, and the value plummeted.\nWhat makes stablecoins unique?\nWhat makes stablecoins unique?\nThe thing that makes stablecoins different is that they mimic another asset's value. Other cryptocurrencies have prices based on what they offer and market demand; stablecoin prices depend on the asset they're following.\nThis gives stablecoins some advantages over traditional cryptocurrencies. Most notably, a stablecoin is much better suited for being an actual digital currency that you can store, transfer, or use to pay for goods and services. Because it has a stable value, you don't need to worry about price fluctuations.\nWhere stablecoins came from\nWhere stablecoins came from\nJ.R. Willett, a member of the early Bitcoin community, is considered the inventor of stablecoins. He came up with the idea of asset-pegged cryptocurrencies in 2012 and mentioned it in the white paper for his MasterCoin protocol.\nThe first stablecoin was BitUSD, a crypto-backed stablecoin that launched in 2014. It lost its peg to the U.S. dollar in 2018 and never recovered. The first fiat-backed stablecoin, Tether (USDT 0.01%), launched later in 2014. Although it has gone through some controversies and price fluctuations, for the most part Tether has maintained its peg.\nHow stablecoins work\nHow stablecoins work\nMost stablecoins maintain reserves. The organization behind a stablecoin adds to the reserves when it mints new coins.\nIt's easiest to explain by using an example. A fiat-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin, such as USD Coin (USDC -0.0%), needs reserves equal to the number of coins it has in circulation. It can maintain reserves by increasing and reducing the supply as people buy and sell their coins.\nLet's say you decide to buy $100 in USD Coin. The $100 you pay is added to that stablecoin's reserves, and 100 USDC is minted and sent to you. If you decide to sell your 100 USDC, they'll be bought back using $100 from the reserves and then removed from circulation.\nThere are many stablecoins out there, and they don't all work the same way, but the general idea is usually the same. Whether a stablecoin is backed by fiat money, crypto, or a commodity, funds are added to the reserves as coins are minted. The exception is an algorithmic stablecoin since it relies on algorithms instead of a reserve system.\nStablecoin and crypto research\nStablecoin and crypto research\nStablecoin examples\nStablecoin examples\nHere are a few prominent examples of stablecoins:\n- Tether is a U.S. dollar stablecoin. It's the largest stablecoin by market cap and normally has the highest daily trading volume of any cryptocurrency.\n- USD Coin is a U.S. dollar stablecoin and the first cryptocurrency chosen by Visa (V 0.59%) for settling transactions.\n- PAX Gold (PAXG 0.05%) is a gold-backed stablecoin designed to make gold more easily tradeable.\n- Dai (DAI -0.01%) is a crypto-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin. It's managed by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.\nCan I make passive income with stablecoins?\nCan I make passive income with stablecoins?\nYou can make passive income with stablecoins through crypto lending programs. Stablecoins, especially those that follow fiat currencies, are popular choices for lending because of their stable prices. Since a stablecoin's value won't drop -- assuming it doesn't lose its peg -- it's safer to lend out than other types of cryptocurrencies.\nKeep in mind that crypto lending has its risks. Most crypto lending programs stipulate in their terms that they're not responsible for lost funds. If borrowers default, you could lose money.\nUnique risks\nUnique risks\nThe biggest danger with stablecoins is that they're not guaranteed to maintain their pegs. It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming a stablecoin will always have the same value as the asset it follows, but plenty of stablecoins have failed over the years.\nTerraUSD is a cautionary tale that illustrates what can go wrong with stablecoins. It was part of the Terra (LUNA 2.78%) ecosystem, and it attracted a huge number of investors because of Terra's Anchor Protocol. Anchor was like a savings account that offered users an APY of almost 20% on their TerraUSD deposits.\nIt worked out well until TerraUSD lost its peg during a period of heavy market volatility. The price dropped from $1 to less than $0.20 in a matter of days and eventually fell below $0.02. Investors who had put their life savings in TerraUSD lost almost everything.\nThat's (almost) a worst-case scenario, and there are more secure stablecoins. However, the bottom line is that no stablecoin is 100% secure. There's no guarantee that a stablecoin will always be exchangeable for the asset it's pegged to, and you don't get the same protections from stablecoins that you do from money in a bank account.\nAre stablecoins a good investment?\nAre stablecoins a good investment?\nStablecoins generally aren't investments, but they can be a good choice for investors who want to build passive income streams.\nSince stablecoins aim to maintain a set value, they aren't made for investing. The price of a stablecoin will ideally be the same in the future as it is today, in which case whatever you buy will be worth the same as when you bought it. If you're interested in cryptocurrency investing, you're better off buying coins that could increase in value.\nWhere stablecoins work very well is generating passive income through crypto lending. Crypto lending programs often pay high interest rates on stablecoins. Make sure to spend plenty of time researching both the stablecoin and the lending program to evaluate the security they offer.\nStablecoins are also a convenient way to invest in digital representations of commodities. Let's say you've decided to invest in precious metals and want to add gold to your portfolio. Instead of buying and storing gold bars, you could invest in a gold-backed stablecoin. Once again, it's important to research any commodity-backed stablecoins you're thinking of buying.\nHow to buy stablecoins\nHow to buy stablecoins\nIf you want to buy stablecoins and you have an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, check which options your exchange has available. Many of the biggest crypto exchanges sell at least one or two U.S. dollar stablecoins. The fastest option is buying on an exchange where you're already signed up.\nIf you want a specific stablecoin, check which exchanges have it available. Motley Fool Money, a Motley Fool site, provides information on cryptocurrency availability at major exchanges. This can help you track down the exchanges that carry stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies you want.\nThe best way to look at buying stablecoins is that you're really buying the organization that issues the stablecoin. You're trusting that organization to keep the value of the coin where it should be. Before you buy, spend time learning about the organization's reputation and review how the stablecoin maintains its peg."

Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "XRP (XRP 0.79%) is a cryptocurrency designed to facilitate cross-border payments. Transactions are fast and ultra-cheap, which traditionally hasn't been the case when sending money abroad. Launched by Ripple (formerly Ripple Labs) in 2012, the utility of XRP has helped it become one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world.\nUnderstanding it\nUnderstanding XRP\nLike other types of cryptocurrency, XRP is decentralized, but it's closely tied to the technology company Ripple. Ripple has developed a public blockchain called the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and a blockchain-based global payments platform called RippleNet, both of which use XRP.\nXRP is the native cryptocurrency on the XRPL, meaning it's the primary token on that blockchain and is used to pay transaction fees. RippleNet uses XRP as a bridge currency for international transfers, which is potentially this crypto's most exciting use.\nRole in cross-border payments\nXRP's role in cross-border payments\nRipple wants to change the global payments industry with blockchain technology. Banks have long used the SWIFT system for international payments, but it has some notable drawbacks. The average transfer time is about 18 hours, according to a study by Statrys, and in some cases, transfers can take three to five days. The sender also often needs to pay a transfer fee, usually of $15 to $30.\nRippleNet, in use by more than 300 financial institutions, is a much more efficient solution. Payments process in three to five seconds and cost a small fraction of a cent. RippleNet also provides an on-demand liquidity (ODL) service, which is where XRP comes into play. International transfers involving multiple currencies are complicated, normally requiring one bank to have reserves available in the other currency, or the transfer will need to involve intermediaries.\nWith ODL, XRP serves as the intermediary. The sender converts their currency into XRP and makes the transfer through RippleNet. The receiver sells the XRP for their own local currency. It's a real-time cross-border payments service, and it's made possible by XRP.\nInvesting\nInvesting in XRP\nIf you want to invest in XRP, you can buy it on many of the major crypto exchanges. But should you? The fact that XRP has a legitimate real-world use is a big advantage over much of the crypto market, considering how many projects are built around hype without offering anything of value. Ripple is also partnered with some of the biggest financial companies in the world, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.12%) and Bank of America (BAC 0.51%).\nHowever, partnering with Ripple doesn't mean these banks are adopting XRP. Large banks generally don't need a bridge currency for international transfers. They send money through RippleNet because of the speed and low costs, but they aren't actually converting funds into XRP at any point. In addition, financial institutions that use cryptocurrency for money transfers will likely opt for stablecoins instead of XRP. Stablecoins aim to maintain a fixed value, such as $1; the price of XRP can fluctuate quickly.\nXRP could still gain value for its role as a bridge currency or for its role on the XRPL. It may be a multibagger, or it could plummet in value. That's par for the course when investing in cryptocurrency. If you decide to buy XRP, limit it to a small amount of your portfolio to keep your risk manageable.\nRelated investing articles\nHow transactions work\nHow XRP transactions work\nEvery blockchain network has a consensus mechanism, which is how it validates transactions. The consensus mechanism plays a vital role, because it determines transaction accuracy, speed, and cost. The XRPL consensus mechanism is fairly unique. Most modern blockchains use proof of stake, and some older blockchains, most notably the blockchain for Bitcoin (BTC 0.12%), use proof of work.\nThe XRPL has a network of independent validators. These validators receive transactions, check if these transactions follow the rules, and then propose a list of transactions for the next ledger. The validators share their lists, compare them, and see which transactions they agree on. A new ledger is approved once it has a supermajority, meaning at least 80% of the validators agree on it. By using a validator network, XRPL is able to achieve fast, cheap, and energy-efficient transactions."

      "text": "Seems like every time the stock market goes up for any length of time, someone on Wall Street starts forecasting imminent doom. Usually, this involves predicting the dreaded \"stock market correction.\" A stock market correction is a drop of between 10% and 20% in a major market index.\nRead on to learn when you can expect a market correction, what they mean for your portfolio, why you shouldn't worry about them, and how to use them to your advantage.\nCorrection vs. crash\nCorrection vs. crash\nThe most important thing to know about a market correction is this: You won't know it's a market correction until it's officially over.\nA market correction is by definition a drop of less than 20%. Between the time when the market enters the \"correction territory\" of a more-than-10% decline and when it stops falling, you won't know if it's \"just\" a correction, or a more serious market crash -- usually defined as a rapid market drop of more than 20%. Or, potentially, it could become a bear market, a prolonged period of market decline of more than 20%.\nBear Market\nWhat causes a correction?\nWhat causes a correction?\nMarket corrections and crashes can be triggered by a number of things.\nSometimes it's an external crisis, like the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. Other times, a particular industry or economic sector implodes and sends ripples across the entire market, as with the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 or the housing crash and resulting financial crisis of 2008.\nOther times, there's just a sense that the market is \"overheated,\" meaning stock valuations have gotten too high. If big institutional investors make that determination and pull money out of the market, the resulting small drop can send retail investors into a selling panic, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nCrises don't always trigger corrections, though. When oil prices collapsed in 2014, the bull market continued unabated. Investor sentiment, economic indicators, global politics, and breaking news all play a role in determining whether and when a correction occurs...or doesn't.\nTake, for example, this chart showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 from May-August 2008:\nThis looks like a classic \"market correction.\" Both the Dow and the S&P 500 fell between 10% and 20% (as of mid-July), but the market rebounded a bit immediately afterward and then crept slightly upward.\nUnfortunately, here's what happened next:\nThis, of course, was the crash that triggered the Great Recession, but notice how similar this chart looks to the one above: After the market hits bottom in March 2009, we see an immediate bounce, and then what looks like slow growth resuming. Of course, nobody knew at the time that the bear market had truly ended, and that we were starting the longest bull market in U.S. stock market history.\nOne final note: Sometimes, if people are evaluating bear markets as well as crashes and corrections, they'll just refer to all three as corrections. So don't be surprised if you encounter the term market correction used to describe a major drop like the one above. Similarly, a crash can trigger a more prolonged bear market, so those terms are sometimes used interchangeably as well.\nCan you predict a market correction?\nCan you predict a market correction?\nThe short answer: no.\nThe more complete answer: Market corrections have been a part of the ebb and flow of the stock market since its inception. Historically, the probability of experiencing a market correction within the next ten years is 100%.\nRelated Investing Topics\nStock market corrections are great times to buy\nFar from a time to panic, market corrections usually turn into outstanding buying opportunities, as they are often both brief and mild. All 28 corrections over the past 50 years have been more than completely erased by a subsequent bull market rally.\nWhat's more, the S&P 500 has spent almost three times as many days over the past 50 years rallying compared to the days it's spent in correction. Though there are no guarantees in the stock market, buying an index fund, or a basket of high-quality stocks within a major index like the Dow or S&P 500, during a correction is about as close to a surefire long-term investment strategy as you're going to get."

  "argos_summary": "XRP has surged 421% in 2024 but remains overvalued given its modest fee revenue (~$1.9m annually). Potential upside hinges on catalysts such as the RLUSD stablecoin, first XRP ETF approval, and a crypto\u2011friendly US administration, while downside risks include low fee income, competition from stablecoins and banks, and regulatory uncertainty. RippleNet currently processes ~$713m in transactions, yet only 691 XRP tokens are collected in fees, underscoring the mismatch between market cap and earnings. The Motley Fool\u2019s top\u201110 stock list excludes XRP, suggesting a cautious stance for now. A price correction is likely before year\u2011end 2025 if these catalysts fail to materialize.",
