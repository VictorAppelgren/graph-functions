  "content": "The financial world was abuzz on Friday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential interest rate cut in September, sparking a significant rally on Wall Street.\n\nWhat Happened: Powell\u2019s dovish tone during his much-anticipated speech led to the largest cross-markets surge since April. This surge saw a significant drop in two-year yields, a rally in treasuries, and futures traders placing their bets on a rate cut in September.\n\nHis comments regarding the \u201cshifting balance of risks\u201d that could necessitate a policy adjustment led to the S&P 500 Index rebounding from a five-day slide.\n\nIt rose by 1.5% and nearly hit a record high. The Russell 2000 also saw a surge of nearly 4%, driven by rate- and economically-sensitive stocks.\n\nAccording to the report by Bloomberg, risk assets such as Bitcoin and gold rose, while the dollar weakened.\n\n\"Powell's remarks highlight his attempt to steer the US economy safely through another challenging stretch, a dynamic supportive of stocks but more problematic for longer-dated Treasuries. Cutting before tariff-driven inflation takes hold could worsen pressures down the line, hitting Treasuries hardest,\" macro strategist Tatiana Darie told the outlet.\n\nAlso Read: Jim Cramer Has Blunt Message for Fed Chair Powell After July Job Numbers Tanked\n\nPowell\u2019s speech at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium was closely watched by financial markets, which have been pricing in a near certainty that the Fed would cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point at next month\u2019s meeting.\n\nWhy It Matters: Powell\u2019s dovish tone has reignited optimism, despite recent uncertainties surrounding the Fed\u2019s next move and warnings from some central bank officials that a September cut wasn\u2019t certain.\n\nHis signals that the central bank is prepared to change course echoed a similar sentiment from a year ago at the Jackson Hole event.\n\nHowever, the market\u2019s anticipation of a Fed pivot has been premature several times since the pandemic, and Powell has emphasized that the bank is taking a data-dependent approach.\n\nThis makes it challenging to predict the extent of the central bank\u2019s cuts in the coming months.\n\nTrump Warns of New \u2018Great Depression\u2019 if Courts Block His Tariff Plan: \u2018It Would Be 1929 All Over Again\u2019",

Learn how to time your next move. Details here \u2192\nPresident Donald Trump is warning of potential economic fallout if his extensive tariff policy is overturned, hinting at a new Great Depression.\nWhat Happened: Trump voiced his apprehensions in a post on Truth Social, suggesting that a negative verdict on the tariff policy by a \u201cRadical Left Court\u201d could have catastrophic implications for the country\u2019s economy. He underscored the difficulty the U.S. would face in bouncing back from such an economic setback.\n\"If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date, in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money, wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. has ever seen, it would be impossible to ever recover, or pay back, these massive sums of money and honor. It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!\" he said in the post.\n\"There is no way America could recover from such a judicial tragedy, but I know our Court System better than anyone, there is no one in history that has gone through the trials, tribulations and uncertainties such as I, and absolutely terrible, but also amazingly beautiful, things can happen. Our Country deserves SUCCESS AND GREATNESS, NOT TURMOIL, FAILURE, AND DISGRACE,\" Trump further added.\nAlso Read: Jim Cramer Has Blunt Message for Fed Chair Powell After July Job Numbers Tanked\nThe President\u2019s tariffs, introduced on Thursday, have stirred the global trade system. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a 0.5 percent loss in the aftermath of the tariff imposition, and the S&P 500 index also dipped by approximately 0.1 percent.\nHowever, the markets made a comeback on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing a 0.6 percent increase and the S&P 500 index climbing by 0.8 percent.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is presently examining Trump\u2019s rationale for his tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Earlier this week, former House Speaker Paul Ryan speculated that Trump\u2019s emergency tariff authority could be overruled by the Supreme Court.\nWhile economic historians generally agree that tariffs were not a cause of the Great Depression, some do argue that the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act signed into law on June 17, 1930, less than nine months after the Wall Street crash of 1929, made the Depression worse.\nWhy It Matters: The potential reversal of Trump\u2019s tariff policy could have far-reaching implications for the U.S. economy. The President\u2019s warning of a possible depression underscores the gravity of the situation.\nThe tariffs, which have already caused fluctuations in the stock market, are a contentious issue that could significantly impact global trade.\nThe outcome of the U.S. Court of Appeals\u2019 review of the tariffs under the IEEPA will be critical in determining the future direction of the U.S. economy.\nRead Next\nImage: Shutterstock/Dennis MacDonald\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Learn how to time your next move. Details here \u2192\nIn light of a disappointing jobs report released on Friday, Jim Cramer has urged the Federal Reserve to implement a cut in interest rates.\nWhat Happened: The nonfarm payroll growth for July was a mere 73,000, falling significantly short of the anticipated 100,000. Additionally, the figures for May and June were revised downwards by a total of 258,000.\nThe unemployment rate for the nation rose to 4.2% last month, as forecasted, while wages saw a modest year over year increase of 3.9%.\nDuring a show on CNBC, Cramer voiced his concerns, stating, \u201cWe have very little job growth, and we have wages that are not going up. That is when you cut.\u201d He also criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for his delay in implementing rate cuts.\n\"I've been a big backer of Jay Powell. But this is a number that says, \u2018Jay, you didn't need to wait' to cut rates,\" Cramer added.\nAlso Read: Powell Puts Breaks On September Rate Cut\u2014And Trump Triggers A Metal Market Crash\nThis disappointing jobs report comes on the heels of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep short-term rates between 4.25% and 4.5% for the fifth consecutive meeting, despite President Donald Trump\u2018s insistence on a rate cut.\nThe market is now forecasting a higher likelihood of a rate cut at the central bank\u2019s meeting in September.\nThe dismal jobs data, along with President Trump\u2019s revised tariff plans, has sparked a substantial market sell-off. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines of over 1.5% and 2%, respectively, during morning trading.\nWhy It Matters: The sluggish jobs growth and stagnant wage increases underscore the challenges facing the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve\u2019s reluctance to cut rates, despite mounting pressure from the White House, has raised concerns about the central bank\u2019s ability to stimulate economic growth.\nThe market\u2019s reaction to the jobs report and revised tariff plans indicates growing investor uncertainty. The potential rate cut in September could provide a much-needed boost to the economy, but its impact remains to be seen.\nRead Next\nDonald Trump Announces 15% Tariff Trade Agreement With EU, Ending Months Of Trade Uncertainty\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
