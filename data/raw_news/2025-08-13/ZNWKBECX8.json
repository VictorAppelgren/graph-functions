  "description": "US authorities are tracking AI chips that are being diverted from their destinations by smugglers and sold to countries with export restrictions",
  "content": "The Trump administration is cracking down on illegal AI chip shipments to China by placing tracking devices inside the packages.\n\nU.S. authorities are tracing AI chips that are being diverted from their destinations by smugglers and sold to countries with export restrictions, according to a report from Reuters.\n\nEven after President Donald Trump loosened regulation on Chinese access to American semiconductors, the trackers are still being used by the administration to build a case against individuals, as well as companies earning profits by violating US trade restrictions.\n\nSources told Reuters the trackers are placed in shipments of servers from large U.S. chip makers, including Nvidia and AMD. Moreover, server manufacturers such as Dell and Super Micro are equipped with US trackers.\n\nThe tracking devices are reportedly placed in the packaging of the server shipments.\n\nA variety of US agencies are involved in the effort, including the Bureau of Industry and Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe report was unable to determine when the trackers are installed on the chips during the shipping process.\n\nHowever, in one case, trackers were placed inside the packaging of a shipment of Dell servers with Nvidia chips. Authorities even found a way to hide the trackers within the servers themselves, Reuters reported.\n\nFor decades, law enforcement has used location tracking devices to combat semiconductor smugglers seeking to evade US trade restrictions.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. began barring the sale of AI chips manufactured by Nvidia and AMD to China.\n\nChip smugglers have, in some cases, discovered the tracking devices and removed them from Dell and Super Micro servers. Reports state the largest trackers were approximately the size of a cell phone.\n\nFollowing the report, Dell released a statement claiming the company is \u2018not aware of a U.S. Government initiative to place trackers in its product shipments.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Super Micro told Reuters it will not discuss its \u2018security practices and policies in place to protect our worldwide operations, partners, and customers.\u2019\n\nThe U.S. has sought to control the flow of AI chip exports in recent years to curb China\u2019s technological advancement of its military. Restrictions were also placed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn the past, congressional lawmakers have urged U.S. chip makers to install location verification technology on their products to help combat smugglers.\n\nDespite these restrictions, Trump on Monday made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to ship certain AI chip products to China.\n\nThe companies agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of their revenue from sales of AI chips. The White House indicated on Tuesday that future deals could be on the table for other chip makers.",

      "text": "AI companies Nvidia and AMD to pay 15% of China chip sales revenues to US\nTwo American AI companies have agreed to hand over 15 percent of their chip sales revenue in China to the US government in exchange for export licenses, sources have revealed.\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) entered an unprecedented arrangement with the White House to promote and sell their semiconductors in China last week, three people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times.\nThe AI giants secured licensing specifically for Nvidia\u2019s H20 and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips, both specifically designed to comply with US export restrictions.\nTrump told Nvidia it could sell the H20 AI chip in China last month after opposing the idea, but he never went through with the licensing to make those sales feasible.\nMeanwhile, Trump had barred AMD from selling the MI308 chip in China.\nThe CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, met with Donald Trump last week to review the bizarre deal, according to sources, including a US government official.\nThe Commerce Department allegedly started issuing licenses for the semiconductors just two days later.\nTwo of the anonymous sources told the outlet that Trump has not decided what the money will be used for.\nThe CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang (right), met with Donald Trump (left) last week to review the bizarre deal, according to sources, including a US government official\nTrump had barred AMD from selling the MI308 chip in China before entering last weeks agreement\nBut the deal could pour more than $2 billion into the US government, The New York Times reported.\nAMD has not responded to the Financial Times' request for comment, but Nvidia did issue a vague statement on the matter.\nThe $4.4 trillion company wrote: 'We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.'\nWhile AMD CEO Lisa Su had not directly addressed the 15 percent revenue agreement, she spoke about the $280 billion company's place in China last week.\nShe told Bloomberg Television that Trump-imposed trade restrictions with China should not deter investors.\n'We are seeing a lot of positive signals over the last 90 days in terms of what the market needs from computing,' she told the outlet.\n'We have a number of licenses under review, and we\u2019ve been given good indications those are moving through the process.'\nJust as sources say Trump and the AI companies entered the agreement, the president declared he would impose a 100 percent tariff on the imports of semiconductors and chips unless the company is 'building in the United States.'\nWhile AMD CEO Lisa Su (pictured) had not directly addressed the 15 percent revenue agreement, she spoke about the $280 billion company's place in China last week\nTrump told Nvidia it could sell the H20 AI chip in China last month after opposing the idea, but he never went through with the licensing to make those sales feasible\nAmid Trump's tariff crackdown, he has been issuing hefty tariffs on other countries - with China facing the majority of the brunt - to encourage domestic production.\nNews of Trump's discreetly entered agreement with Nvidia and AMD has been slammed by experts who say the move could have detrimental repercussions when it comes to US-China relations.\n'This is an own goal and will incentivize the Chinese to up their game and pressure the administration for more concessions,' Liza Tobin, who previously served as China director at the National Security Council, told The New York Times.\n'This is the Trump playbook applied in exactly the wrong domain. You\u2019re selling our national security for corporate profits.'\nThe move to sell microchips to China has been heavily criticized, as many see it as a threat to national security and a move against America's best interests.\nUS security experts said the H20 in particular will aid the Chinese military efforts and boast China in its AI development race against the US.\nNvidia's devices are generally regarded as better quality than those of its Chinese-made counterpart, Huawei.\nBut the Trump administration has said it will not allow China to purchase Nvidia's most powerful chips.\nUS security experts said Nvidia's H20 in particular will aid the Chinese military efforts and boast China in its AI development race against the US\nDespite these massive wins for Nvidia and AMD, the Chinese government has actually warned citizens that the H20 has security risks (pictured: President Xi Jinping\nThe H20 chip was approved under the Biden administration and lacks the capabilities of chips sold within the US and to allied nations.\n'We don\u2019t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third best,' Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, told CNBC last month.\nHuang convinced Trump to let up on his previously established boundaries by arguing that not allowing American companies to compete in the Chinese market would be harmful to the US, according to The New York Times.\n'The American tech stack should be the global standard, just as the American dollar is the standard by which every country builds on,' Huang said last month during a podcast with think tank the Special Competitive Studies Project.\nDespite these massive wins for Nvidia and AMD, the Chinese government has actually warned citizens that the H20 has security risks.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China summoned Huang over possible 'backdoor security risks' with the H20.\n'There is no such thing as a \u2018good\u2019 secret backdoor \u2014 only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,' Nvidia disputed in a blog post."

      "text": "Trump lets AI super-corporation Nvidia sell its chips to CHINA...but there's a big catch\nDonald Trump has granted permission for America's most valuable company to sell its AI chips to China, in a surprise move amid trade war tensions.\nJensen Huang, founder of $4 trillion artificial intelligence firm Nvidia, has said he received assurances from the government that he can market the chips in Beijing.\n'I'm very happy,' Huang told reporters during a visit to the Chinese capital where he met with senior officials, according to the Wall Street Journal, as Nvidia shares rose more than four percent in pre-market trading on Tuesday.\nThe product, known as a H20 chip, is used in cutting-edge data centers which train AI models and operate AI applications.\nIt was designed for Chinese customers and was a top seller last year, until Trump's commerce department restricted sales in April, costing Nvidia billions of dollars.\nHowever, the catch is that the H20 chip isn't the most advanced AI chip Nvidia sells, and the company is still being held back from selling its best technology in China.\nThis is due to fears that granting full access to America's most cutting-edge technology to the superpower could pose a national security risk.\nHuang said Nvidia would resume deliveries of the H20 chip in China once the Commerce Department processes the company's export license for it.\nDonald Trump has granted permission for America's most valuable company to sell its AI chips to China , in a surprise move amid the tense trade wars between the global superpowers\nJensen Huang (pictured), founder of $4 trillion artificial intelligence firm Nvidia , has said he received assurances from the government that he can market the chips in China\nThe Trump administration is also considering granting permission for other AI chip manufacturers, including Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to resume sales in China.\n'We were recently informed by the Department of Commerce that license applications to export MI308 products to China will be moving forward for review,' AMD founder Patrick Moorhead announced on X.\n'We plan to resume shipments as licenses are approved. We applaud the progress made by the Trump administration in advancing trade negotiations and its commitment to US AI leadership.'\nHuang said Nvidia has also developed a new AI chip for use in Chinese factory automation and logistics.\nThe chip uses Nvidia's most advanced set-up - called Blackwell architecture - but it has been downgraded in some ways to address US officials' concerns about exports to China, sources told the WSJ.\nAhead of Huang's trip to Beijing, US Senators Jim Banks (R., Ind.) and Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) penned a letter to Huang asking him to refrain from meeting with companies which are working with military or intelligence firms in China.\n'We are worried that your trip to the PRC could legitimize companies that cooperate closely with the Chinese military or involve discussing exploitable gaps in the U.S export controls,' the senators wrote.\n'We request that you refrain from meeting with representatives of any companies that are working with the PRC's military or intelligence establishment, are named on the Entity List, or are suspected to have engaged in activities that undermine export controls.'\n'I'm very happy,' Nvidia founder Huang (pictured) told reporters during a visit to the Chinese capital where he met with senior officials, according to the Wall Street Journal\n'There is a new bipartisan consensus that the hardware powering advanced AI, which includes NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs), is of immense strategic importance,' the letter added.\n'If exported freely to the PRC, this hardware could accelerate the PRC's effort to modernize its military.'\nThe letter added that Nvidia's chips could be used by Chinese companies, including DeepSeek, to smuggle sensitive technology in violation of US law.\n'We hope you will agree that it would be deeply irresponsible for an American CEO to meet with companies that violate U.S. law and are actively developing military capabilities that could undermine U.S. national security,' the senators said.\nThe surprise move by the Trump administration to allow Nvidia to sell the H20 chips on Beijing's markets comes amid ongoing trade tensions between the US and China.\nChina and the US have been tussling over rare earth metals which are used to make magnets, defense products and electronics, since 2018.\nThe tensions ramped up this year when Trump increased tariffs on China by 10 percent during his first weeks back in the White House.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping responded with a 15 percent tariff on coal and liquified natural gas products, and various tariffs on machinery and cars.\nThe tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China escalated over several weeks, until May 12, when the superpowers agreed to reduce tariffs in an effort to de-escalate the trade war\nNvidia's product, known as a H20 chip, is used in cutting-edge data centers which train AI models and operate AI applications. It was designed for Chinese customers and was a top seller last year, until Trump's commerce department restricted sales in April\nThe tit-for-tat tariffs escalated over several weeks, until May 12, when the superpowers agreed to reduce tariffs in an effort to de-escalate the trade war.\nOn June 11, the White House said a trade deal with China had been reached, with baseline tariffs set at 10 percent by China and 30 percent by the US.\nBoth countries made concessions, with the US agreeing to resume accepting Chinese students into American colleges, and China to resume shipments of rare earths.\nHowever, China downplayed the deal as just a 'first meeting'.\nSince then, the US has made moves to restrict AI shipments to Thailand and Malaysia over concerns that they could be smuggled to China.\nBoth countries have been dealt economic blows by the trade wars, with rising commodity prices and American countries like Nvidia losing billions in exports."

  "argos_summary": "The Trump administration is intensifying its crackdown on illegal AI chip shipments to China by embedding tracking devices in packages to monitor smuggling activities. U.S. authorities are using these trackers to trace AI chips diverted from their intended destinations, particularly from major chip manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD. Despite previous restrictions, Trump has recently allowed Nvidia to sell its H20 AI chip in China under specific conditions, while both Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from these sales to the U.S. government, raising concerns about national security and the implications for U.S.-China relations.",
