  "title": "Wolves 2025-26 season preview: Pereira handed greater control and chance to prove his pedigree",
  "description": "The Portuguese head coach instigated last season's revival but Wolves will be anxious not to be drawn into another relegation fight",
  "content": "Wolverhampton Wanderers are gearing up for the start of the Vitor Pereira era: Phase Two.\n\nAfter leading the club to safety from a perilous position in the second half of last season, Pereira is about to embark on a first full campaign at the helm after a summer in which he was handed a greater level of control.\n\nThe Athletic looks ahead to the 2025-26 season and assesses the club\u2019s Premier League prospects.\n\nWhat are the expectations inside the club for this season?\n\nAfter Wolves avoided relegation with a level of comfort last season under Pereira, the expectation within Molineux is to use a stress-free campaign as a stepping stone to something more.\n\nWhether that is a realistic aim will depend largely on the success of their summer recruitment, with Jorge Mendes\u2019 Gestifute organisation more involved this summer than in recent years.\n\nWho have they signed?\n\nThree new faces have arrived in the shape of Colombia international forward Jhon Arias \u2014 one of the stars of the summer\u2019s revamped Club World Cup \u2014 Norway left wing-back David Moller Wolfe and talented attacker Fer Lopez from Celta Vigo.\n\nThat is in addition to Jorgen Strand Larsen, whose permanent move from Celta following last summer\u2019s season-long loan was a formality as the deal was always set up to be a long-term transfer.\n\nMost notably, a replacement for Nelson Semedo, but several holes in the squad still need filling, including another forward to compete for starts as one of Pereira\u2019s dual \u2018No 10s\u2019 and a holding midfielder to provide natural cover for Andre.\n\nBut the most pressing need is at right wing-back, where captain Semedo\u2019s departure on a free transfer has left just Ki-Jana Hoever, 23, and Rodrigo Gomes, 22, as recognised options.\n\nMarc Pubill turned down Wolves with a deal agreed and a medical booked, choosing instead to sign for Atletico Madrid, while another young Spaniard, 21-year-old Juanlu Sanchez, also seems reluctant to move to Molineux.\n\nWith three weeks of business remaining, Pereira\u2019s squad appears light on numbers in key areas.\n\nWhat else is new?\n\nThe setup behind the scenes, both on the training field and in the corridors of authority.\n\nSporting director Matt Hobbs has gone, replaced in a redefined role by Domenico Teti, the former Sampdoria director and a confidant of Pereira from their time together at Al Shabab in Saudi Arabia. Bruno Moura and Filipe Almeida have been added to Pereira\u2019s coaching team.\n\nIt is part of a complete reshaping of Wolves\u2019 football setup, led by chairman Jeff Shi, and a sign that he and the decision-makers at owner Fosun have gone \u2018all in\u2019 on Pereira, giving him more authority than any head coach has enjoyed at Molineux since Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nWho has been the best player in pre-season?\n\nResults and performances in pre-season have been underwhelming, so picking out a star performer is difficult, but new captain Joao Gomes has probably been the stand-out player with a combination of energy, leadership and composure in possession.\n\nWhat are people excited about?\n\nSeeing how Pereira builds on his positive first five months in charge, now that he has had a whole summer to plan and prepare.\n\nSupporters re-engaged with the club during a run of six successive victories in the spring following the grim end to O\u2019Neil\u2019s once-promising tenure.\n\nThere is also excitement at the prospect of seeing Arias, who was one of the best players in South America, in a Wolves shirt.\n\nAfter the success of two imports from Brazil\u2019s top flight \u2014 Joao Gomes and Andre \u2014 Wolves fans have reason to hope that Arias (a former team-mate of Andre at Fluminense) could provide some fun in the coming season.\n\nWhat are they worried about?\n\nWolves fans are no strangers to selling their best players and moving on. They sold Ruben Neves and Raul Jimenez and lost Joao Moutinho and Adama Traore in the same summer and still stayed in the Premier League.\n\nThey sold Pedro Neto to Chelsea last summer and survived again thanks to Pereira\u2019s rescue act.\n\nBut each time they part with one or two of their prized assets, there is an inevitable sense of trepidation at what the future might hold. This summer is no different.\n\nHow is the manager feeling?\n\nPereira has suffered some of the transfer frustrations that have been familiar to some of his predecessors, with signings taking a while to arrive after the departures of Cunha and Ait-Nouri in the early days of the window.\n\nBut he is also conscious that this season at Wolves is his chance to prove himself over an entire campaign in the league he has targeted for more than a decade, so with that comes a sense of great opportunity.\n\nWhat\u2019s the percentage chance of him seeing out the season?\n\nWhen Wolves won six games in a row, it seemed a certainty that Pereira would get the whole of this season to put his plans in place.\n\nWhen they collected just one point from the final four games, the chances seemed to recede a little, perhaps to 75 per cent, as fans suffered some vague flashbacks from previous underwhelming endings that were followed by difficult starts the following year.\n\nBut the release of the new season\u2019s fixtures gave Wolves a fair chance of making a solid start. Given how much authority Wolves have placed in him, it would take an extended period of struggle for his position to come under threat. So let\u2019s say 85 per cent.\n\nAndre is the talk of the January transfer window. Wolves were always determined not to sell him in the summer, but if the Brazil international maintains his form from the end of last season, bigger clubs will begin to take notice.",

  "summary": "Wolverhampton Wanderers is set to begin the second season of the Vitor Pereira era, following a summer where he was given more control. The club avoided relegation last season, but expectations within Molineux are high for this season. The success of their recruitment will depend on the success of Jorge Mendes' Gestifute organisation. Three new players have already arrived, including Colombia international forward Jhon Arias, Norway left wing-back David Moller Wolfe, and attacker Fer Lopez from Celta Vigo. However, several holes in the squad still need to be addressed, including a replacement for Nelson Semedo. Sporting director Matt Hobbs has been replaced by Domenico Teti, former Sampdoria director and a confidant of Pereira from their time together at Al Shabab in Saudi Arabia. Bruno Moura and Filipe Almeida have been added to Pereira's coaching team.",
  "shortSummary": "Wolverhampton Wanderers, under new coach Vitor Pereira, face challenges in their upcoming season but are optimistic about their Premier League future despite significant summer signings and changes in management.",

      "text": "Nelson Semedo remains a free agent. As long as that remains the case, there is a theoretical chance he could re-sign for Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nBut no one at the club expects the 31-year-old to return. Instead, Wolves have been preparing for life without the man who ended last season as their influential captain.\nAdvertisement\nWolves, who offered Semedo a four-year contract towards the end of last season, have made no firm comment on the right-back\u2019s future out of respect for his service since joining in 2020.\nThey expect, though, that in the coming weeks, Semedo will announce that he has signed a contract elsewhere. In the meantime, Wolves are looking hard for replacements.\nThat means the time is fast approaching to consider Semedo\u2019s legacy at Molineux. It is a complicated task and it is instructive to look back two years to the time when his initial three-year contract expired.\nIn the summer of 2023, there was a genuine debate at Wolves about whether to activate an option to keep Semedo for a further two years.\nIn the end, the club decided to trigger the clause but the fact they considered allowing him to leave tells the story of his early time in the Premier League.\nThere was pressure from day one, due to the fee \u2014 an initial \u00a327.5million ($37m) from Barcelona \u2014 and the fact that he was bought to replace Matt Doherty, who had been a popular and key player in Wolves\u2019 successes under Nuno Espirito Santo.\nTo begin with, Wolves fans were less than convinced that the significant net outlay \u2014 they recouped around half of Semedo\u2019s transfer fee by selling Doherty to Tottenham Hotspur \u2014 had brought them an upgrade.\nAs Nuno attempted to transition from his successful 3-4-3 system to play a four-man defence, Semedo struggled to handle the defensive demands of playing at right-back in the Premier League.\nWhen Wolves reverted to playing him as a wing-back outside a three-man defence, it gave Semedo more scope to use his athleticism and fitness, but recurring defensive errors and a lack of precision in attacking areas meant his effectiveness was limited.\nHis weakest season was his third, which coincided with the dismal start to the campaign under Bruno Lage, followed by a brief spell under Julen Lopetegui.\nAdvertisement\nSo when decision time arrived at the end of that campaign, it was not a straightforward call. On one hand, Semedo still had a good reputation around Europe and triggering the option in his contract protected his resale value. On the other hand, the Portugal international was one of the club\u2019s highest earners.\nThe decision to keep him was rewarded with his best two campaigns in Wolves colours, under Gary O\u2019Neil and then Vitor Pereira.\nSemedo showed his experience, making fewer defensive lapses and posing a greater threat in attack.\nThe biggest impact, however, came out of fans\u2019 view. As Pereira arrived with the task of rebuilding a crumbling team, with Matheus Cunha\u2019s attitude being increasingly questioned and former captain Mario Lemina making clear his desire to leave, Semedo became the mortar that helped hold it together.\nOne of O\u2019Neil\u2019s last significant acts at Wolves before being sacked in December 2024 was to appoint Semedo as captain. When Pereira took over, Semedo kept the armband and was credited with galvanising a dressing room that could easily have been shattered following a poor run of results.\nHis performances remained solid if unspectacular, and his influence on the team grew each week.\nIn his five years at Wolves, Semedo was known as solid, ultra-professional and low-maintenance. In his final five months, he was regarded as almost inspirational.\nStill, it now feels like an official parting of the ways is just a matter of time.\nIn the unlikely event that Semedo\u2019s move away from Wolves falls through and he returns to Molineux asking to sign the contract that has been on the table for months, the club would need to consider the optics of allowing a player to re-sign essentially because he cannot do better elsewhere.\nThere is no doubt that Semedo enjoyed his time at Wolves and left at the end of last season on excellent terms but the club believe he had made up his mind that his future lies elsewhere.\nAdvertisement\nTo present a change of heart as anything other than a backup plan from Semedo would be a challenge \u2014 but it is not a quandary Wolves expect to be presented with.\nDespite his long influence, he is unlikely to enter the hall of fame from Wolves\u2019 Fosun era, but he will be remembered as a player who, from difficult beginnings, built an excellent reputation with fans and colleagues alike.\n(Top photo: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers have completed the signing of left-back David Moller Wolfe from Dutch club AZ.\nThe 23-year-old has signed a five-year deal until 20230 after the clubs agreed a fee of in the region of \u20ac11.5million (\u00a39.9m).\nWolfe effectively replaces Rayan Ait-Nouri in the Wolves squad after the Algeria international joined Manchester City in a \u20ac37m transfer in June. Wolfe also links up with his Norway teammate Jorgen Strand Larsen, who joined the club permanently this summer after spending the 2024-25 campaign on loan at Molineux.\nWolfe was a staple of AZ\u2019s squad last season, recording three goals and eight assists in 47 appearances in all competitions as AZ finished eighth in the Eredivisie and reached the round of 16 stage of the Europa League.\nAfter playing for Bergen Nord and SK Brann in his native Norway, Wolfe joined AZ in 2023 and has featured 92 times for the team.\nHe made his senior international debut in a friendly against the Faroe Islands and has been capped 12 times, scoring once.\nAs well as Strand Larsen\u2019s permanent move, Wolves have seen wingers Fer Lopez and Jhon Arias arrive from Celta Vigo and Fluminense respectively.\nIn addition to Ait-Nouri on the outgoings front, forward Matheus Cunha left for Manchester United, while Pablo Sarabia has joined Qatari club Al Arabi.\n(Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Wolverhampton Wanderers have completed the signing of Jhon Arias from Fluminense. Arias has cost his new club an initial \u20ac17million (\u00a314.7m/$20m), with a further \u20ac5m potentially payable in future add-ons.\nThe 27-year-old attacker has signed a four-year contract at Molineux until 2029. The deal includes the option of a further 12-month extension.\nAs part of this summer\u2019s transfer coverage on The Athletic, in addition to breaking news, tactical analysis and in-depth reads, our Transfers TLDR series (you can read them all here) will bring you a quick guide to each of the key deals.\nGive me their backstory in 100 words\u2026\nArias\u2019 career has been a slow burn. He was 23 before he managed to establish himself as a regular starter at a senior side, which was Independiente Santa Fe in his homeland of Colombia.\nSince that breakthrough in 2021, he has progressed quickly, moving to Brazil in the same year to join Fluminense. He became one of their key creative forces, catching the eye at this summer\u2019s Club World Cup in the United States. Since making his debut in 2022, he has played regularly for Colombia and was an important part of the side that reached last year\u2019s Copa America final.\nSteve Madeley\nWhat should and shouldn\u2019t I expect to see?\nOutrageous pieces of flair and imagination are Arias\u2019 trademark, so Wolves fans will hope to be out of their seats regularly.\nTypically, players moving to the Premier League from Brazil need time to adapt. Arias\u2019 former Fluminense team-mate Andre made the same move a year ago and took some time to get to grips with the intensity and tactical demands, but he found his feet spectacularly in the second half of last season.\nAdvertisement\nArias might not hit the ground running but fans will be hopeful of a similar transition.\nSteve Madeley\nHow will they fit tactically?\nWolves need creativity following the departure of Matheus Cunha to Manchester United. Arias provides just that through dribbling and passing, creating a tournament-high 18 chances at the Club World Cup.\nArias should fit into the \u2018No 10\u2019/attacking midfield position vacated by Cunha, having played on both wings and as an attacking midfielder throughout his career. While not as quick over large distances as he once was, Arias has the flair and acceleration to beat defenders.\nHe is a threat from set pieces, even scoring with this powerful right-footed curler against Ulsan HD at the Club World Cup.\nWe can watch Jhon Arias\u2019 free-kick all day long. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf4\nGLOBAL HOME OF FOOTBALL | Live All Summer long | https://t.co/i0K4eUu4lJ | #fifacwc #takeittotheworld pic.twitter.com/jfs5Bqyn1K\n\u2014 DAZN Football (@DAZNFootball) July 16, 2025\nArias is not a prolific scorer, though, with only 59 goals across 338 career club matches.\nAnantaajith Raghuraman\nWhat\u2019s their injury record?\nArias has no recent history of lengthy injuries. He had played every minute of the Brazilian Serie A season as well as the Club World Cup.\nThe only noticeable blot on his record is an ankle injury that saw him substituted off in September 2023, but he returned less than two weeks later.\nCerys Jones\nSomeone who knows him says\u2026\n\u201cHe has been growing in confidence with every game,\u201d Fluminense head coach Renato Gaucho told FIFA\u2019s website during the Club World Cup.\n\u201cHe has received a lot of well-deserved praise and that has made him more and more confident, because he takes on even more responsibility. He\u2019s having a great tournament. He\u2019s the kind of player who always worries opponents.\nHe has also called Arias \u201cone of those players who can change a game\u201d.\nCerys Jones\nWhat do we know about the finances of the deal?\nWolves\u2019 purchase of Arias has set them back \u20ac17million, bringing him to Molineux on a four-year deal until June 2029. There is an option to extend by a further 12 months.\nThe sale is the joint-third highest in Fluminense\u2019s history, with their record sale also a departure to Wolves. The Midlands outfit bought Andre from the Brazilian side for \u00a318.5m a year ago.\nChris Weatherspoon\nWhat impact will this have on both clubs\u2019 PSR calculation?\nAssuming agent fees of 10 per cent plus a four per cent transfer levy, signing Arias will add \u00a34m in amortisation costs to Wolves\u2019 2025-26 books, then a further \u00a34.3m per season to the end of 2028-29.\nArias\u2019 new wage is unknown but it will take the cost of buying him beyond the estimated \u00a316.8m in acquisition fees. According to Brazilian media, Arias was Fluminense\u2019s highest-paid player following a contract renewal this year.\nAdvertisement\nFluminense signed Arias from Colombian side Santa Fe in August 2021 for around $600,000. That stands them in good stead for a hefty profit, but the Brazilian side only own 50 per cent of Arias\u2019 economic rights. Arias came through the academy of Colombian side Patriotas and they retain the other 50 per cent.\nFluminense may have negotiated a greater than 50 per cent share of the proceeds with Patriotas, but if not, the two clubs will bank similar profits. Arias\u2019 book value at Fluminense is negligible, given he has been at the club for several years and he was well into his previous contract before that recent renewal.\nAs this is an international transfer, five per cent of the fee is reserved for clubs who had a hand in Arias\u2019 development up to the age of 23. That comprises around \u00a3740,000, a little under half of which should go to Patriotas. After that, assuming Fluminense don\u2019t successfully negotiate for a higher share of the proceeds, both they and Patriotas will bank around \u00a36.9m each.\nChris Weatherspoon\n(Top photo: Getty)"

      "text": "Nominative determinism, i.e. the theory that people gravitate towards jobs or activities that reflect their name, is a thing.\nResearchers once found that people called Dennis or Denise were more likely to gravitate towards dentistry (this is genuine).\nIt\u2019s not a universal truth. Someone called Louise Baker isn\u2019t necessarily destined to wear chef whites for a living. Likewise, Tony Dull doesn\u2019t have to become an accountant.\nAdvertisement\nBut when Wolves signed David Moller Wolfe last week and James Trafford decided to join Manchester City, they became the latest quirks in football\u2019s history of throwing up ironically placed players.\nTrafford will not only return to the city that houses the shopping mall the Trafford Centre or the Trafford Park area, but also, of course, Old Trafford, i.e. the home of City\u2019s greatest rivals. It\u2019s a bit like someone called James Park being in goal for Sunderland.\nHe becomes the second goalkeeper in Manchester whose surname shares the name with a park in the city. Heaton Park, which recently hosted about 300,000 people across five glorious Oasis homecoming gigs, was named after Manchester United goalkeeper Tom Heaton in honour of his contribution to the club since he signed in 2021 (three appearances and counting). This is not true; the Heaton Hall estate dates back centuries, but hopefully you believed that for a second.\nOf course, Manchester United do have a young player named after them \u2014 Kobbie Mainoo. Or at least, to those fans who use Man U as a pejorative when referring to the club.\nThe most shocking example of a rival\u2019s home in a player\u2019s surname, though, has to be the man we know as Barcelona legend Gerard Pique, or to give him his full name, Gerard Pique Bernabeu. The Bernabeu, of course, is the name of rivals Real Madrid\u2019s home ground.\nHowever, the Bernabeu name is certainly no source of shame for Pique; his grandfather Amador Bernabeu was formerly a vice-president at Barcelona. Still, it\u2019s pretty ironic that one of Real Madrid\u2019s ultimate hate figures shares a name with the club\u2019s home.\nSometimes you see the name of a club and think it must be fate. That was certainly Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein\u2019s take when, in 1989, he met some chap called Arsene Wenger for the first time.\nAdvertisement\nWenger, then Monaco manager, attended an Arsenal match at their old Highbury ground, and Dein took him to a friend\u2019s house for dinner.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018This guy\u2019s something special, he\u2019s a bit different\u2019,\u201d Dein later recalled to the BBC. \u201cJust then it was like a flash of lightning, I sort of saw in the sky: \u2018Arsene for Arsenal: it\u2019s destiny; one day he will be our manager\u2019.\u201d\nThree Premier League titles and seven FA Cups later, Dein\u2019s destiny worked out alright. Good job that he wasn\u2019t called Dave Wenger.\nPerhaps the most blatant case of managerial nominative determinism is Wolfgang Wolf managing Wolfsburg.\nIt was only his second career job (after Stuttgarter Kickers), and he lifted Wolfsburg to what was then the club\u2019s highest-ever finish of sixth in 1999, lasting five years before he was kicked out of the pack.\nYou might think Molineux was the next logical destination for Wolf, which sadly never happened. Wolves had already signed a namesake in 1994, though, in the form of Dutch defender John de Wolf. This wasn\u2019t due to a flash of lightning that then Wolves manager Graham Taylor saw in the sky; Taylor had been impressed by De Wolf when seeing him play for the Netherlands against England.\n\u201cI wrote a book in 1994 and said hopefully one day I\u2019d play in England\u2026 the book came out in December and that was the month I joined Wolves,\u201d De Wolf later told The Athletic. \u201cAlso, the name of the club \u2014 my name! It just fitted.\u201d\nDe Wolf was an instant cult hero. \u201cDe Wolf man\u201d was a regular chant at Molineux when the burly defender with a lengthy golden mane would saunter up the field to take long throws.\nHe\u2019s now been followed up by Wolves signing AZ Alkmaar\u2019s Norwegian left-back David Moller Wolfe for \u20ac11.5m (\u00a310m).\nWolfe told Wolves.co.uk: \u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s pretty cool to have that surname and then to play for Wolverhampton.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cMe and my brothers have actually joked a little bit about it a couple of years ago, and now it is turning into a reality. I think it was meant to be.\u201d\nThere was only one club that recently retired midfield Salva Sevilla was supposed to play for, but sadly he only ever made the B team for the Spanish club. Surprisingly, he would go on to make his name at Sevilla\u2019s big rivals Real Betis. Ditto former Tottenham Hotspur defender Mike England, who managed Wales for eight years in the 1980s.\nMat Sadler, though, did get it right when he played for Walsall, i.e. the Saddlers, not once but twice during his playing days, and is now the club\u2019s manager.\nGraham Potter served \u2018the Potters\u2019 with distinction during his playing days when he featured for Stoke City for three years. Christian Fuchs joined the right English club when he moved to Leicester City in 2015; Fuchs in German means fox.\nIt\u2019s not just club names that elicit destiny for players; positions do too.\nWhat other position on the field would former Belgian player Mark De Man play other than defence? It just had to be true.\nIn fact, De Man played all across the back line, as a full-back or a centre-back and was even known to pop into defensive midfield, playing for Anderlecht in Belgium and with Roda JC in the Dutch Eredivisie, all the while shadowing his opponents extremely closely. Opposition players knew exactly who was arriving when their team-mates shouted; \u201cDe Man on!\u201d\nIn a less obvious but still fitting outcome, one-time Premier League player John Utaka simply had to play as an attacker, which he did pretty successfully for Portsmouth in the late 2000s, providing the cross that led to Portsmouth\u2019s winning goal in the 2008 FA Cup final.\nSome names are curious given their styles of play, like beanpole 6ft 7in striker Peter Crouch, or legendary Italian defender Claudio Gentile, a player famed for being an aggressive nutcase rather than a serene ball-player.\nAdvertisement\nNames don\u2019t always forge a path of fate in football; Gareth Barry never played for Barry Town, while Isaac Success only played for Watford in England. But when it happens, it\u2019s pretty satisfying.\n(Top image \u2014 Illustration: Eamonn Dalton / The Athletic; Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images; Zohaib Alam \u2013 MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "Wolverhampton Wanderers are entering the 2025-26 season under manager Vitor Pereira, who has been given more control following a successful stint that kept the team in the Premier League last season. The club has made several signings, including Jhon Arias and David Moller Wolfe, but still faces challenges in filling key positions, particularly at right wing-back after the departure of Nelson Semedo. With a reshaped football setup and a focus on building on last season's success, expectations are high, but concerns remain about potential player departures and the team's depth.",
