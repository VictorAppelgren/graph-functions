      "feedback": "This draft would be world-class with a regime-based, first-principles narrative that ties multi‑year fundamentals to market pricing and avoids overgeneral assertions. Actionable edits: (1) Replace the single-base-case narrative with a four-regime framework (A: inflation near target with persistent cloud/AI productivity boosts; B: inflation surprises push real rates higher; C: tariff/import-cost shocks with pass‑through to margins; D: disinflation/deflation risk and margin compression) and specify explicit triggers for each (e.g., cloud capex/Azure growth deceleration or reacceleration, 21.2% cloud CAGR from Grand View Research, and the 39% Azure growth cited for MSFT; tariff pass‑through signals from the Mark Cuban/ tariff discussion; policy rate/inflation trajectories from the inflation/headline risks in the retirement pieces). (2) Root the causal chain in first principles: show how durable cloud/AI cash flow supports higher long-run multiples when discount rates stay anchored by inflation and real rates; translate this into a base-case valuation logic for moat‑led names (e.g., UNH, LULU, MSFT, SHOP) using the documented cash‑flow durability and balance-sheet strength (e.g., UNH’s cash generation and dividend yield near 3% and LULU’s long-run profitability despite near-term guidance cuts, as noted in IGP1Q4ZEJ). (3) Quantify the base case with clear numbers from sources: MSFT Azure growth (39%), the cloud/capex outlook (Grand View 21.2% CAGR to 2030), and the stock-specific multiples cited (LULU ≈ 13.5x forward at one point; UNH free‑cash‑flow/dividend metrics). Add Morningstar’s safe withdrawal signal (3.7%) and the 2025 401(k) contribution cap ($23,500; catch‑up $8,000) to anchor long-horizon financial planning in the retirement lens (sources 0G3A676BP, IGP1Q4ZEJ, YVQU6QCY4, and 0G3A676BP’s cloud/AI content; plus source 11 and 6 for numbers). (4) Strengthen catalysts and invalidation: label concrete catalysts (e.g., sustained cloud revenue visibility, contract-book growth, healthcare-cost trajectories, tariff pass-through timing) and clear invalidation triggers (e.g., sustained Azure growth well below mid‑single digits on a multi‑quarter horizon; real rates rising with inflation well above target for an extended period; a material policy shift). (5) Reconcile conflicts by flagging where sources diverge (e.g., tariff-headline risk vs. long‑term cloud secular growth; Burry’s stock moves as a sentiment/signal rather than a cash-flow verdict) and state a probability-weighted view rather than a blanket stance. (6) Tighten format and length by delivering the horizon as a compact, regimes-driven arc with a concise base case, explicit risks, watch list, and confidence band; ensure all claims tie to the IDs above and avoid extrapolating beyond the numbers.
