Let me tell you. The clip, for our audio listeners, is Mina essentially on every ESPN show,\u201d Kylie explained. \u201cAnd I love this because I'm a tell you right now, Mina would not be on every f------ show if she wasn't absolutely nailing it.

I'm really talking about bread 60 percent of the time now,\u201d the \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer said. \u201cI'm just, like, always baking bread and texting my friends and being like, \u2018Can I send you some bread? I need some feedback. Do you like this one better than you liked the other one? Like, I did the rise a little differently.\u201d\n\nAnd the Grammy winner\u2019s love of sourdough has included making treats for Kylie, Jason, 37, and their four daughters \u2014 Wyatt, Elliotte, Bennett and Finn.\n\n\u201cBeen really experimenting with the flavors there because we got now wild blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, the original and Kylie got me baking the cinnamon sugar,\u201d Swift said, adding, \u201cThis one I've been workshopping for the girls because they love everything rainbow, funfetti sourdough \u2026 Because they love sprinkles.

After meeting on Tinder, the retired NFL player and Kylie made their romance Instagram official in March 2015. They got married in April 2018 and went on to welcome four children together: daughters Wyatt Elizabeth, Elliotte Ray, Bennett Llewellyn and Finnley \"Finn\" Anne. After 13 seasons in the NFL, Jason announced he was retiring from football in March 2024. During his retirement speech, he tearfully remembered the moment he met Kylie, saying, \u201cI still remember the moment she walked through the door. The first instance is burned in my retina.

Both of her parents are here, my parents came in, and she has a lot of friends, family members. She's not alone by any stretch of the imagination,\" the pro athlete told reporters the day after his firstborn's birth in October 2019, noting that his teammates and coaches had been very supportive. \"There's not much I can do.

During a September 2023 podcast episode of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce, she talked about spotting him on the app. \"His profile at the time was something along the lines of, 'I want to have deep meaningful conversations and talk about getting married and having kids,' \" she recalled. Kylie said that for their first date, she went to meet Jason and his friends at a bar. However, the date didn't last long. \"Forty-five minutes later, he fell asleep at the bar, like just, out, like asleep, asleep,\" she said in the documentary.

And to all the people who told me I was glowing... that was sweat,\" the mom-to-be joked on Instagram in August 2019. Their eldest daughter, Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce, was born on Oct. 2, 2019. Jason told reporters that originally they were thinking Wyatt for a boy and Charlotte for a girl, but friends took the latter name first and they liked how Wyatt sounded \"regardless\" of sex. Wyatt now has three little sisters. Elliotte Ray Kelce arrived on March 4, 2021; Bennett Llewellyn joined the family on Feb. 23, 2023; and Finnley \"Finn\" Anne was born on March 30, 2025. She supported her husband at the Super Bowl \u2014 while very pregnant Jason Kelce with his wife, Kylie, and two of their children. Kylie Kelce/Instagram Kylie was in the stands to cheer Jason on during the 2023 Super Bowl \u2014 and she was fully prepared in case she went into labor during the game. While Kylie brought her two OBs to the stadium in case she went into labor at the Super Bowl, she didn't end up giving birth that day. \"It was an epic game, an epic Super Bowl, an epic one for our family. We did miss out on one thing that could have made it more epic though. That baby is still inside Kylie's belly,\" Jason said during a February 2023 podcast episode of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce. He added, \"I was actually rooting for Kylie to go into labor and have the baby at the stadium. I feel like that's very selfish of me, but that's what I wanted to happen. I don't know why I wanted that to happen.\" On Feb. 10, 2023, Kylie talked to PEOPLE about her competitive spirit as Jason and her brother-in-law, Travis Kelce, prepared to face off at the Super Bowl. \"Being part of the Kelce family right now is very exciting,\" she said. \"I, of course, am like, 'Sorry Travis, we're not family this week,' \" she joked. \"But, you know, next week, it'll be all love again.\" She's a podcast host Jason Kelce and Kylie Kelce attend Chris Stapleton's Performance Live From The Fillmore New Orleans for SiriusXM and Pandora on Feb. 6, 2025, in New Orleans. Mike Coppola/Getty In December 2024, Kylie launched a podcast venture of her own, Not Gonna Lie. It was an instant hit, climbing to No. 1 on Spotify and Apple charts immediately after its debut. \"It absolutely blew my mind that you guys were able to get Not Gonna Lie to the No. 1 spot,\" she said during the second episode. \"I'm still in disbelief about that. The way that everyone has not only been so kind in the anticipation for episode 1, but then also the reactions you guys have had in the comments have been so encouraging, and I really appreciate you guys having such positive feedback considering I'm still a rookie and we're working out the kinks.\" Fans even declared Kylie \"the funniest Kelce\" in a post on X. In response, Jason quipped, \"Funniest looking...\" In August 2025, Travis' girlfriend Taylor Swift hopped on the New Heights podcast. The appearance broke New Heights' viewership records, which had previously been held by Kylie. (Her September 2023 appearance garnered 8.6 million views.) But Kylie took it all in stride. \u201cOfficially no longer the record holder for the most watched episode of the other podcast,\" she said during her Aug. 14 episode of Not Gonna Lie. \"There's no way it's even close, and I love that for me.\" She is a philanthropist The Kelces both give back to their community. Jason established his own foundation, (Be)Philly, a non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of Philadelphia's youth, in October 2022. \"Whether my family, my friends, or my fellow Philadelphians, I have always felt an overwhelming love and support that has helped reach my dreams and potential on and off the field. Now it's my turn,\" Jason wrote on the nonprofit's website. And Kylie has regularly helped raise money for the Eagles Autism Foundation. She throws an annual event at Ocean Drive in Sea Isle City, New Jersey, which raised $150,000 \u2014 of which the Kelces donated $50,000 \u2014 in its second year in 2022. Kylie has been volunteering from an early age \u2014 as a high schooler, she worked with the Special Olympics of New Jersey and helped pack boxes to send to troops. She played field hockey at the collegiate level Kylie McDevitt Kelce poses with two girls. Kylie Kelce Instagram As a student, Kylie played field hockey at Lower Marion High School in Ardmore, Pa., as well as during college. According to her Cabrini Athletics page, during her senior year in 2016, she was named to the All-CSAC First Team and ECAC South All-Stars First Team and scored 15 total points on five goals and five assists. In 2019, she called becoming a part of the Cabrini Field Hockey family \"one of the best decisions I've ever made.\" Kylie is now the head field hockey coach at her former high school and tries to teach her players how to see their team \"as your family.\" \"All of the things that we focus on \u2014 yes, we focus on skill. Yes, we focus on endurance. We focus on all the things that could potentially help us win in field hockey, but ultimately, I'm trying to help them win at life,\" she told PEOPLE in August 2024. \"So all of those character-building opportunities are things that we focus on mostly.\" She's friends with Taylor Swift Taylor Swift and Kylie Kelce in the suite during an NFL game on Jan. 21, 2024, in Orchard Park, N.Y. Andrew Mather/Kansas City Chiefs via AP Kylie first appeared to cross paths with her brother-in-law's girlfriend, Swift, when they shared a suite in January 2023, when the Kansas City Chiefs played against the Buffalo Bills. Kylie and Swift posed for photos together during the game, including one that Amanda Santa, the wife of Travis' manager, Aaron Eanes, shared on Instagram. The new friends were reunited at the 2024 Super Bowl as they cheered Travis on. In a video shared on X, Kylie and Swift can be seen chatting in the suite, along with the singer's dad, Scott. Over the years, Kylie and Swift have deepened their friendship. In April 2025, Taylor subtly supported Kylie after she welcomed her fourth child. Swift even picked up on one of Kylie's signature phrases while recalling Jason's shirtless shenanigans at the Chiefs vs. Bills playoff game in January 2024. \"One of the first things I saw was that you said to Kylie, 'I was just shotgunning beers with the Bills mafia, and I really wanna go through one of the fire tables, I wanna jump onto the flaming table,' \" Swift said during her August 2025 appearance on New Heights. \"And she goes, 'Okay, can we not do that right now?' \" She continued, \"And since then, I've heard her say that exact thing to your 4-year-old, about like, 'Mommy, I wanna throw this pudding on the wall, wouldn't that be fun?' \" She and Jason starred in a Wawa campaign Wawa \u2014 a convenience store chain \u2014 tapped Jason and Kylie to promote the brand's famous hoagies. Together, they filmed several short comedic commercials. \u201cDirecting these Wawa commercials with Jason is similar to the way I manage every day with our family,\u201d the mom of three said in a press release. \u201cI try to go in with a plan, but distractions happen, so we just take everything in stride and do our best.\u201d Close Leave a Comment Read more: Celebrity Celebrity Relationships"
