      "text": "How to choose a robot vacuum in 2025: Don't buy one before considering these features\nTable of Contents\nMaking the call to buy a robot vacuum instead of a stick vacuum now isn't the risk that it was half a decade ago. Not when you have a grasp on the robot vacuum features to look for.\nBack then, lazy suction power and even lazier attempts to return to the dock had many robot vacuum lemons collecting dust while their embittered owners reverted to vacuuming by hand. But in 2025, the best robot vacuum brands like iRobot, Roborock, Shark, and Eufy have robust lineups of robot vacuums that actually make life easier \u2014 not harder. And as more and more robot vacuums adapt to the changing expectations from consumers, features that were once considered premium are much easier to afford nowadays.\nDespite the less intimidating cost spectrum, it's still possible to underpay or overpay for a robot vacuum. The question isn't whether or not a robot vacuum is worth it in your home at all \u2014 it's about which features are worth it in your home. So many brands offering affordable premium features can make it hard to know how to choose a robot vacuum that'll best suit you. I can yap about all of my learned tips on how to make your robot vacuum work better once you already have it. But for those still in the shopping phase, here's a straightforward buyer's guide on the most important factors to consider before buying a robot vacuum.\nDo I need a self-emptying robot vacuum?\nSelf-emptying robot vacuums are definitely worth the convenience, regardless of how big your space is. If you're already trying to absolve yourself of vacuuming responsibilities, chances are that you also won't feel like dealing with the dust bin multiple times per week.\nWhen cleaning is automated, your floors are probably going to be swept more often, anyway, filling up a robot vacuum's onboard dustbin faster. Larger homes and homes with pets will expedite dustbin fullness as well. A self-emptying robot vacuum will come in clutch here, which automatically empties its debris into the same dock it charges on. This leaves you off the hook from any dustbin maintenance for at least a month or two.\nAutomatic emptying docks do require more floor space than the toaster-sized docks of standalone models. But there are many compact self-emptying robot vacuums that would fit in a small space.\nWhat is a smart mapping robot vacuum?\nIf there's one robot feature that you don't skip, make it this. Smart mapping is a type of navigational tech that enables a robot vacuum to scope out and remember a copy of your home's floor plan. The map drawn during the vacuum's initial mapping run will pop up in the corresponding smartphone app, where you tweak it by dragging and dropping borders, merging or splitting rooms, and adding labels. Then, the robot vacuum can clean specific rooms that need attention that day, or complete a whole-home clean.\nRobot vacuums with smart mapping are usually far more agile when it comes to maneuvering around furniture. The bump-and-go approach that most early robot vacuums rely on just can't perceive a jungle of chair legs until it's too late. I'll die on the hill that smart mapping is the baseline brain power that any robot vacuum worth your money should have. If you think about it, actual cleaning skills don't even come into play if a robot vacuum can't successfully get itself to the spots that need to be cleaned.\nLuckily, smart mapping isn't an expensive ask nowadays. A budget cap of $200 is more than enough to secure room-to-room mapping from reliable brands like Shark or Roborock.\nSpot cleaning and virtual no-go zone\nMost robot vacuums that can remember the different rooms in your home can also adhere to app-drawn barriers around smaller zones within those rooms, like around a pile of Lego bricks or your pet's water bowl. This capability is crucial if you purchase a robot vacuum that does mop but doesn't recognize the difference between tile and a bath mat (more on this in the mopping section below).\nSmall obstacle avoidance\nThis navigational prowess would mean you shouldn't have to set keep-out zones in the app at all. Robot vacuums with small obstacle avoidance can detect and avoid problem-causers like cords, laundry, and even pet waste \u2014 things that are bound to show up on the floor on one day or another. The freedom that comes with skipping the pre-tidying routine is far too convenient.\nWhile the cameras used to perceive obstacles in front of them aren't exactly the kind that take pictures, some fancier robot vacuums legitimately have livestream cameras. These give you a floor-level view of whatever the vacuum sees as it's roving your home, making it a pretty comforting tool for pet parents when they're away. Some cameras are even accompanied by two-way microphones to talk to your pets or call another person who's at home.\nWhat robot vacuum works best on hardwood floors?\nRobot vacuums have a much easier time sweeping free-floating debris off hardwood or tile than carpet. However, crumbs and hair don't have anything to grab onto on hard floors like they do on carpet, so debris often gets blown into corners. If you're picky about the cleanliness of the outskirts of the room like I am, look for a robot vacuum with a dedicated extendable edge sweeping brush. These go further than the lousy side brush affixed to cheap robot vacuums \u2014 they actually reach out a few inches past the robot vacuum's circular shape to push debris out of 90-degree angles and edges, like along the kitchen counter. Roborock's FlexiArm, seen on the Saros 10 and Saros 10R vacuums, is my favorite example.\nCan robot vacuums go from hardwood to carpet?\nYes, just about any modern robot vacuum can switch between floor types without a hiccup. However, if your home has a heavy rug situation (including those pesky fluffy bath rugs), look for a robot vacuum with large wheels that can hoist it over various thresholds and carpet piles.\nIf your home has a pretty even mix of hard floors and carpet or rugs, floor type sensors will make your life easier. With these, a botvac can tell the difference between hard floors and soft ones, adjusting its suction method (and sometimes even how high it's hovering over the floor) accordingly. This looks like suction that's automatically boosted when the robot vacuum encounters carpet or, lifting mopping pads when the vac approaches a rug.\nDo I need a robot vacuum that mops?\nIt's definitely worth getting a robot vacuum and mop combo if your home has a lot of hard flooring. If you don't feel like doing your own vacuuming, you're probably even more severely depleted of the motivation to do your own mopping.\nMopping intensity varies greatly from vacuum to vacuum. While nearly any 2-in-1 model can probably reliably wipe up a fresh juice spill with its wet cloth, a mopping mechanism like sonic mopping (which vibrates) or dual pressurized mopping pads (which spin) exert the elbow grease needed to penetrate dried stains or shoe prints. Many flagship hybrid models released in 2023 or later can also mop with a cleaning solution rather than just plain water \u2014 if you're big on true barefoot-ready sanitation. You could even shop for a soap based on your floor type, like hardwood cleaning solution or pet-safe ingredients.\nSelf-cleaning mopping pads\nWhen deciding on a robot vacuums that mop, you have two options: models that can go from vacuuming to mopping by themselves, or models that need you to be home to physically make the switch to mopping mode. Cheaper 2-in-1 robot vacuums require a person to attach a water tank or mopping pad to switch to mopping mode, while more advanced models permanently have their mopping gear onboard and are ready to start mopping whenever called upon.\nThe first approach is typically more affordable, but your robot vacuum won't be able to complete a full vacuum and mop session if you're not home to ditch the water tank. These docks also tend to get smelly if not tended to regularly enough, along with mildewy mopping pads if you don't toss them in the laundry often enough. This level of manual involvement is more annoying than it's worth to some people \u2014 a lot of folks on Reddit ask for vacuum-only robot vacuum recommendations to avoid dealing with it altogether.\nYou can get out of this by opting for a robot vacuum and mop that can wash and dry its own mopping pads. Their self-empty dock also houses two water tanks \u2014 one for rinsing and refilling clean water, and one to hold the dirty water \u2014 plus fans beneath the vacuum for drying. If you're worried about bacteria or mildew, look for a self-cleaning dock that dries with hot hair.\nThe ideal robot vacuum and mop combo for pet hair will have this feature to mitigate the amount of fur that builds up on a mopping pad.\nAutomated mop washing isn't what it was during its initial breakout in 2024. Now, you have plenty of opportunities to score a self-washing and -drying hybrid model for as low as $500, especially during a sale event.\nWhat robot vacuums work well on carpet?\nVacuuming gets trickier on carpet, where debris clings to carpet like velcro after being stepped on all the time.\nI'll get into suction power in a second, but the brushroll system can make or break a robot vacuum's carpet performance just as much as the power under the hood. The best robot vacuums for carpet wield dual spinning brushrolls. On some robot vacs, these brushrolls sit parallel and spin toward each other to pinch debris and yank it from the carpet fibers. If your one non-negotiable is a robot vacuum that works on pet hair, you might consider a setup where the brushrolls are arranged beside each other \u2014 it'll kind of look like one big brushroll, but with a break in the middle. That opening shoot prevents hair wrapping by pulling hair up into the dust bin instead of pooling it at the sides of the roll.\nWhat is good suction power for a robot vacuum?\nMost robot vacuum brands measure suction power in pascals (Pa). As of August 2025, the strongest robot vacuum you can buy hits 22,000 Pa, though a new Dreame robot vacuum is set to clock 30,000 Pa when it comes out in the fall. Such intense cyclonic oomph isn't necessary in all homes, though I would generally advise against settling for anything less than 5,500 Pa.\nWhat is a good robot vacuum battery life?\nA 90- to 100-minute battery life is sufficient for a robot vacuum to cover an apartment on one charge. This is also fine if most of your cleaning will be done on a room-by-room basis. Battery life of more than 150 minutes isn't hard to find and is ideal for square footage surpassing 2,000.\nWhen battery is low, the robot vacuum will head back to its dock to juice up. Even the cheapest robot vacuums nowadays are self-charging and should automatically resume cleaning afterwards \u2014 meaning you won't have to pick them up and escort them back to the base.\nTopics Robot Vacuums\nFrequently Asked Questions\nLiDAR is a laser-based detection system that scans different points in your home to determine where walls are. LiDAR is quick and accurate, and has solidified its spot as the most prominent form of detection tech in the robot vacuum realm.\nOther robot vacuums map with VSLAM technology, which uses cameras rather than lasers to perceive your home's floor plan. The downside of most VSLAM systems is that they need light to operate, meaning less-advanced robot vacs using VSLAM may struggle to get around in the dark. iRobot, however, has figured out an advanced camera system that incorporates an LED to light the way, not only accurately picking up on walls, but super small obstacles, even in low lighting.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "The best vacuums we've tested, from robots to Dyson stick vacs\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nThe best vacuum cleaner setup is subjective, heavily hinging on how badly you want to do the vacuuming yourself, or if you'd rather have a robot do it for you.\nActual cleaning performance plays a huge role in how spotless your floors will be, of course. But if your vacuum is a pain to clean with, you won't feel like using it \u2014 whether it's an upright vacuum that's too clunky to get out of the closet or a robot vacuum that gets stuck more often than not. I have a handful of recommendations for both, but first, let's unpack which type of vacuum cleaner would be better for your living arrangement.\nShould I get an upright or robot vacuum?\nI could argue for both sides. Ideally, I'd recommend shopping strategically and splitting your budget between one of each type of vacuum. But if you're only choosing one, consider what your main priority for this new vacuum is. Is your ideal vacuum cleaner one that automates the most steps to give you as little work as possible, or is it one that does the absolute most meticulous job, even if you still have to do the work?\nTrusting a robot vacuum to do this chore comes with the fine print that the robot vacuum is probably going to piss you off sometimes. Autonomy-related features like smart mapping, small obstacle avoidance, automatic floor type recognition, and debris level sensors have gotten quite perceptive over the past few years. But even the smartest robot vacuums I've tested are still inanimate objects, not humans with real brains.\nThe obvious downside of an upright vacuum is that you have to have enough free time to use it, and be OK with spending some of that free time off the couch. Granted, the better the cordless vacuum is at cleaning, the less you'll have to get it out, and the less of a pain it'll be to whip around. But at the end of the day, if you detest getting your vacuum out, you probably won't vacuum too often \u2014 and that defeats the purpose of spending your money on a nice, new vacuum in the first place. For that reason, no corded vacuums have been recommended in this list.\nAfter several years of pitting the top robot and stick vacuums against each other in my own home, I've pulled a few of each to create Mashable's ultimate mashup of all of the best vacuum cleaners of 2025.\nAs a senior shopping reporter, I have been testing popular robot vacuums and cordless stick vacuums for Mashable in the various apartments I've lived in since 2019. My own personal three-bedroom apartment \u2014 not a lab \u2014 makes up the testing grounds, where a combination of hardwood floors, tile floors, and rugs of various piles are tackled. Over the course of at least three weeks, each vacuum is put through a series of standardized tests that flow into a scoring rubric that I\u2019ve created to exemplify all factors of owning a robot vacuum and trusting it on a daily basis. That rubric is made up of four pillars, tweaked slightly to apply to robot and cordless vacuums when necessary:\nCleaning thoroughness: I\u2019m pickier than average about what it takes for a floor to feel \u201cclean,\u201d and I\u2019m trusting these robot vacuums in my own home \u2014 then judge them with an efficiency score. Each vac is sent over both fresh messes that are likely to pop up in anyone's house at some point (like crumbs, drinks, and sauces I spill purposefully) and more lived-in messes that build up over time (like dried splatters, shoe prints, and matted-down pet hair on the rug). Any vacuums that mop also complete three additional scrubbing tests on hardwood and tile.\nNavigation: I consider a robot vacuum\u2019s ability to maneuver to the right spot in the first place as a litmus test ahead of getting into any nitty gritty cleaning capabilities. In my testing, each vac\u2019s navigational brainpower is analyzed by its smart mapping accuracy and ability to find specific rooms and zones for spot cleaning, as well as its ability to swerve safely around walls or between chair or table legs. Robot vacuums that can successfully detect phone chargers, pet waste, and laundry are given an extra star. Stick vacuums don't navigate on their own, of course, but I do consider the bulkiness of upright vacuums, and whether they're easy to maneuver with one hand and around furniture.\nUser-friendliness: The ideal vacuum will be a relatively seamless addition to your household, and blend in nearly as easily as any other appliance used daily would. If any vacuum is too loud, clunky, or generally a pain to use, you're not going to want it in your house at all \u2014 so things like noise level, size, and the intuitiveness of using the app can make or break the experience. For upright vacuums, the user-friendliness is all in the handheld attachments that can also impact how extensive your cleaning can get. Battery life is also a bigger playing factor with upright vacuums, as they don't automatically return to a dock to charge every time.\nMaintenance: If someone is already considering the robot vacuum route because of the hands-off cleaning experience, they might want that convenience to extend to dustbin emptying or mopping pad cleaning, too, which would get them off the hook from maintenance for days or weeks at a time. Automatic emptying isn't as much of a thing for upright vacuums as it is for robot vacuums, though they do exist (and get extra kudos). But in most cases, I'm clocking how long it takes for a vacuum's dust bin to fill up \u2014 and if the capacity is on the larger side, I also consider whether that makes the vacuum too heavy to comfortably hold with one hand.\nFinally, the overall bang for your buck has to be considered. Is each vacuum's feature menu and actual cleaning competence worth the price tag, and how practical is that cost for the average household?\nDyson V12 Detect Slim\nBest Dyson for most people\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $500\n- Laser is definitely worth the extra money over V8 or V10\n- Fluffy bristles lap up dust and even bits of broken glass\n- Ridiculously lightweight\n- Tracks dust particle size and boosts suction on dirtier areas\n- Converts seamlessly to handheld for pet hair vacuum\n- Small dust bin\n- Battery may not cover a big multi-story house\n- Motorbar stops spinning on some rugs\nOur review\nRead my full review of the Dyson V12 Detect Slim.\nWho it's for\nIf you're down to do the vacuuming yourself, so long as you get to do it with a Dyson, the V12 Detect Slim should be the main one you're considering. It's not the most basic or heavy-duty option. In fact, those hoping to spend $500 or less on their new vacuum should be able to find the V12 Detect Slim on sale for $499.99 or $449.99 at almost any time of the year.\nWith up to 60 minutes of runtime, it can tackle full multi-bedroom apartments or a single floor of a home a few times without needing to be charged, but homes larger than 2,000 square feet or with more than two pets might prefer a heavier-duty Dyson. As Dyson's most compact cordless vacuum, the V12 Detect Slim will fit better than most cordless competitors into homes with limited storage space, even if that's under a couch or in a sliver of the closet.\nWhy we like it\nCrowning the V12 Detect Slim as a Mashable Choice Award winner was a no-brainer: It's Dyson's most affordable vacuum that's equipped with the game-changing laser. I almost never choose the Digital Motorbar (the other cleaning head in the box) over the Fluffy Optic laser head because the laser really is that helpful. With it, I'm able to sniff out kitty litter dust, rogue hairs, crumbs, and even invisible broken glass on my apartment's hard floors that I wouldn't have seen otherwise but definitely would have hated to step on with bare feet.\nThough the laser alone could be enough to sway someone this way over the similarly-priced Dyson V10 or a model from another main brand, the V12 Detect Slim seals its \"bang for your buck\" status with totally sufficient suction power, a motorized handheld attachment that's essential for cleaning pet hair off furniture, and the best one-handed maneuverability I've experienced in a vacuum. Even with so many vacs in my house to choose from (including robots), the Dyson V12 Detect Slim is so efficient and easy to use that I find myself relying on it the most.\nDetails\nRoborock Saros 10R\nBest robot vacuum right now\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Barely three inches tall\n- Dual spinning mopping pads scrub corners and edges closely\n- Relatively quiet when cleaning, self-emptying, and mop washing\n- Brush rolls really are anti-tangle, for once\n- Barely ever gets lost\n- Auto-dispenses detergent\n- Livestream pet camera is actually pretty useful\n- Phone charger avoidance still isn't perfect\n- Pet hair pickup on low-pile carpet could be better\n- Dock's slightly curved top is annoying\n- Takes forever to mop\n- Doesn't come in white like the Saros 10 does\nOur review\nRead my full review of the Roborock Saros 10R.\nWho it's for\nIf you ask me, the Roborock Saros 10R is the best robot vacuum you can buy in 2025. On top of super strong suction power and special features for corner cleaning, the Saros 10R also self-empties and self-washes and dries its mopping pads. It's pricey, but a worthwhile investment for people who are picky about their cleaning and are willing to pay for the most thorough automated cleaning on the market. The livestream camera complements the heavy duty cleaning nicely for pet parents, in particular.\nWhy we picked this\nThe Saros 10R has a few standout features that make it such a full-fledged floor care suite. It sets itself apart from other robot vacuums in terms of corner cleaning, thanks to an extendable side brush and extendable side mop. The vacuuming one reaches out from underneath the vac several inches further than the average crappy robot vacuum side brush, sweeping directly in corners and along wall edges. The mopping one is a spinning pad that expands the mopping radius further than the vacuum's circumference, allowing it to scrub areas that most round robot mops miss, like under the lip of kitchen counters. It's not exactly the same level of detailed edge cleaning that I can achieve with my Dyson stick vac, but it's a world of a difference over bots that just skim the edges and hope for the best.\nThe Saros 10R dishes out 20,000 Pa suction power \u2014 double the oomph of my favorite robot vacuum from 2024 (the Roborock Qrevo Master \u2014 and automatically works harder when the vacuum senses carpet. Besides the attentive cleaning skills, there's one more cool feature that makes the Saros 10R such a good pick for people with pets: a livestream camera that gives you the POV of the vacuum as it's cleaning. It sounds super extra at first, but it's actually a really comforting tool for checking on pets when you're not home.\nDetails\niRobot Roomba Plus 505 Combo\nBest Roomba for most people\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $800\n- Avoids tricky objects like cords and pet waste\n- Dual spinning mopping pads are a first for iRobot\n- Much better corner cleaning than most robot vacuums\n- Knows when to re-vacuum or mop an extra dirty spot\n- Automatically rinses mop mid-cleaning session\n- Have to create a zone for spot cleaning\n- Auto-emptying sound is ridiculously loud\n- Strong suction power, but only one brush roll\nWho it's for\nSo you don't just want any robot vacuum \u2014 you want the street cred that comes with a Roomba. As the most powerful mopping Roomba of the 2025 models, the Roomba 505 provides an elevated yet straightforward cleaning experience that'd flourish in just about any household. iRobot's top-notch small obstacle avoidance would also make the Roomba 505 an awesome robot vacuum pick for homes with a high chance of random clutter being on the floor on any given day.\nWhy we picked this\niRobot finally picked up on what people want in a robot vacuum that mops: spinning mopping pads. In my experience, the dual-spinning pad setup consistently scrubs more thoroughly and covers more ground than a singular flat mop pad could do. Sometimes, one of the spinning mopping pads sits on a hinge and can mop in corners \u2014 a spot that most basic round robot vacuums usually ignore. I've watched the Roomba Plus 505 Combo scoot right up against the sticky walls by my cats' food bowls, under my kitchen counter, and along my bathtub wall (iRobot estimates that it has 18% closer edge cleaning than former Roombas).\nOf all robot vacuum brands I've tried, premium Roombas like this one have proven to be the best at dodging small obstacles like cords, laundry outside of the hamper, and pet waste. While the most advanced Roborock models have accidentally eaten a charger or sock in my testing, the Roomba Plus 505 Combo has yet to do so. It's this accuracy rate that could convince a robot vacuum non-believer that it's safe to leave running at home alone.\niRobot's room-to-room smart mapping is similarly accurate \u2014 allegedly even better than pre-2025 now that iRobot has made the switch to LiDAR. The new Roomba Home app looks surprisingly clunky despite being paired with new technology, but it's still user-friendly enough for most people. You can even name permanent clean zones within your home map to be swept on a more frequent schedule than the full room, like the area near the kitchen table or front door.\nDetails\nShark PowerDetect\nBest self-emptying cordless vacuum\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Automatic emptying for an upright vacuum rules\n- Boosts suction on carpet and extra dirty spots\n- You can physically feel how strong suction is\n- Self-empty dock doubles as storage without wall mounting\n- Laundry-scented puff after each empty neutralizes odor\n- Bagless dock lasts longer than the advertised 45 days\n- Bendable tube makes vacuuming at low angles easier\n- Doesn't come with motorized handheld attachment\n- Very loud when deep cleaning carpets or rugs\n- Vacuum itself is kind of bulky and heavy\n- Cleaning head always gets locked in storage position\nWho it's for\nIf much of the vacuuming your home requires involves deep cleaning carpet, the Shark PowerDetect is the heavy-duty pick I'd suggest over the Dyson V12 Detect Slim. In my experience, it's just as thorough (if not more thorough) on my pet hair-covered rugs as the most powerful Dysons that cost several hundred dollars more, but is able to balance its airflow in a way that mostly keeps it from getting stuck on carpet \u2014 an issue I've run into when a Dyson is just too powerful.\nBecause all Dysons require manual emptying, the fact that the Shark PowerDetect does self-empty could be your sole deciding factor. If you'd prefer to keep that harrowing gray dust bunny out of sight and out of mind, you'll appreciate not having to empty the PowerDetect into the trash on a daily basis \u2014 especially if you're keeping up with pet hair.\nWhy we picked this\nNot to be confused with the Shark PowerDetect robot vacuum, the Shark PowerDetect cordless stick vacuum doesn't get enough attention for the value it packs. The chance to combine the suction power and handheld control of a manual vacuum with the hands-free convenience of an auto-empty station is inherently huge because it's still pretty rare \u2014 automatic emptying isn't the norm for upright vacuums like it is for self-emptying robot vacuums.\nAs Shark's most powerful cordless vacuum, this thing sucks \u2014 I can literally feel the double brush rolls snatching up the cat hair and other gunk embedded in my rugs as it pulls my hand across the room. The suction actually gets so tenacious and loud that I often find myself switching to Eco mode over Boost or Detect mode. The evidence of how hard it's working lies in a quick glance at the dustbin just a few minutes into sweeping. Because it automatically empties each time it gets hung back on the dock, each cleaning session starts with an empty bin. Even if my floors didn't have much visible debris that time, I was always greeted with a giant gray ball of whatever was invisibly chilling on my rugs.\nMy only real complaint isn't regarding the cleaning itself, but the bulkiness of the cleaning head that does limit how far you can get into or under some spaces. The PowerDetect is also about two pounds heavier than Shark's Detect Pro cordless vacuum, which I also tried and really liked.\nDetails\nEufy E20 3-in-1\nRobot vacuum that turns into a stick vacuum\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Frequently on sale for under $400\n- Shockingly affordable for a robot and stick vacuum combo\n- Suction power of both vacuums is powerful for the price\n- 75 day self-empty dust capacity\n- Room-by-room smart mapping is quite accurate\n- Dock is very compact\n- Doesn't mop\n- A bit loud\n- Physical design doesn't have much curb appeal\nOur review\nRead my review of the Eufy E20 3-in-1.\nWho it's for\nFor the shoppers really struggling to choose between a robot vacuum or stick vacuum, the Eufy E20 3-in-1 is a relatively budget-friendly way to get both. The E20 would especially get daily use if your idea of a clean home goes past the floors to crevices like windowsills, car seats, staircases, or the pit of despair between couch cushions.\nWhy we picked this\nThere's something so genius about a robot vacuum that can turn into a stick vacuum. It's not even that expensive, which makes it an inarguable staple in any list of vacuum cleaners. At $649.99, the Eufy E20 3-in-1 is a reasonable price for a self-emptying, smart mapping robot vacuum \u2014 let alone the whole bonus cordless vacuum and handheld vacuum features.\nWhile the Eufy E20's true power lies in its widespread usability in any situation, its robotic and handheld cleaning power should definitely suffice for any casual cleaner. Its 8,000 Pa of suction power matches the Eufy X10 Pro Omni, which I tested in 2024 and really liked. While its pickup rate along wall edges and efficacy on long hairs on rugs could be better, the robot version of the E20 reliably took care of all visible crumbs and loose dust bunnies on all of the floor types in my apartment. I tended to switch to the upright cleaning head to tackle rugs with heavy layers of cat hair \u2014 its 30,000 Pa of suction power beats out all of the most powerful robot vacuums I've tested. For going after cat hair on the furniture, however (or messes on a windowsill or in the car), having the option to go handheld is something I could never give up. Switching between these modes involves pulling the motor out of the robot vacuum body and clicking it onto one of the included attachments.\nFor the price, I can live with not having small obstacle avoidance, especially because the E20 is a reliable navigator otherwise. Its map of my three-bedroom apartment was extremely accurate on the first try. After that, the Eufy correctly made it to the right rooms and spots on a daily basis \u2014 without getting stuck on a bath mat or under a bed.\nDetails\nTopics Robot Vacuums Vacuums\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThe most powerful corded vacuums do typically have an edge over even the most powerful cordless vacuums \u2014 but not by much. For example, the most powerful upright Dyson vacuum hits 290 AW of suction power whereas the most powerful cordless Dyson vacuum maxes out at 250 AW. But at this point in the game, it's not a noteworthy enough difference to cover the headache of digging that monstrosity out of the closet, wrestling with the cord, or strategizing how to stay near an outlet. In fact, cordless vacuums have gained such traction that most vacuum brands have completely de-centered the corded design \u2014 so most corded options you come across now are probably outdated and are no longer so much more powerful than cordless vacuums.\nYes, definitely. Whether it's a robot vacuum or cordless stick vacuum, automatic emptying of the dust bin will make your life easier either way. Because if a vacuum is doing its job well, its dustbin will inherently fill up quickly \u2014 and you shouldn't be punished by having to face that gross gray blob every day just because you picked a competent vacuum.\nIf you're shopping for a robot vacuum, you're likely attracted to the premise of doing as little work as possible. Many robot vacuums extend this hands-off cleaning experience to dust bin duty by coming with a self-emptying dock. Some 2-in-1 models that mop go as far as automatic mopping pad washing and drying, which I've found to heavily influence how likely I am to let a robot vacuum mop.\nAlternatively, if you're choosing to go the upright vacuum route because you want more control of your cleaning, a self-emptying dock would at least take that part of the chore off your hands. Cordless stick vacuums are also less likely to empty their own dust bins than a robot vacuum, though self-emptying stick vacuums have become much more of a thing in recent years. (Dyson's the one big brand that doesn't offer automatic emptying yet.) These docks are also usually the height of a desk or table and can't exactly be stored in a closet.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "The latest ChatGPT trend? People are using it to turn their pets into humans.\nSince ChatGPT's AI image generator launched to free users a couple of weeks ago, people online have been toying around with its possibilities. The latest trend involves people anthropomorphizing their pets. Yes, really.\nTo be clear, we all kind of act like our pets are humans \u2014 my perfect dog, Henry, is a good boy who loves deeply like a real person. But folks are now using ChatGPT's image generator to imagine what their pets would actually look like as people. It's both kind of neat and a little creepy. Here's a super viral example from Reddit.\nIf you search around other social platforms, you'll find more examples of people who said they used ChatGPT to transform their pets into humans.\nIt seems some folks found the results cute, while others found it unsettling. TechRadar's John-Anthony Disotto wrote that he wasn't \"quite prepared to see a grown man sitting on the yellow armchair [his dog] likes to frequent, and [he] immediately felt a sense of uncanny valley.\"\nThe dog-as-human trend is just the latest to emerge from ChatGPT's image generator. Last week, for instance, folks were turning themselves into AI-generated action figures.\nHow to use ChatGPT to turn your pet into a human\nWhile some folks might avoid seeing their pet as a person \u2014 myself included \u2014 should you want to try it out, it isn't difficult.\nFirst, you have to upload a photo of your pet. Then, the prompt can be simple. You simply ask ChatGPT to turn the pet into a human. The sample from the Reddit post also asked to keep everything else in the photo the same. ChatGPT may ask follow-up questions, but it should be relatively straightforward.\nJust be careful: You can't unsee it.\nTopics Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT OpenAI\nTim Marcin is an Associate Editor on the culture team at Mashable, where he mostly digs into the weird parts of the internet. You'll also see some coverage of memes, tech, sports, trends, and the occasional hot take. You can find him on Bluesky (sometimes), Instagram (infrequently), or eating Buffalo wings (as often as possible)."

      "text": "The best Labor Day Apple deals: Best-ever prices on iPads, MacBooks, and AirPods\nTable of Contents\nIt's Labor Day, folks. That means we're saying so long to summer, heading back to school, and saving big on tech. Apple, unsurprisingly, is offering some impressive discounts \u2014 some as good if not better than Prime Day \u2014 on MacBooks, iPads, AirPods, and more. Skip the Apple Store and head to Amazon to score your favorite Apple gadgets for the best prices.\nHere are the best Apple deals on Labor Day.\nBest MacBook deal\nWhy we like it\nCheck out our full review of the M4 Apple MacBook Air.\nNot only is the M4 MacBook Air our favorite MacBook for most people, but it also earned a top spot on our list of the best laptops overall for 2025. Even at full price, we think it's an impressive value, but we certainly aren't going to argue with $200 savings. The Air can tackle general tasks with ease, plus it can handle some video editing and audio work. If you don't need the heavier specs of the Pro, you can keep a lot of extra cash in your pocket by opting for the Air instead.\nMore MacBook deals\nMacBook Air\nApple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $999\n$1,199(save $200)Apple MacBook Air, 13-inch (M4, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $1,199\n$1,399(save $200)Apple MacBook Air, 15-inch (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) \u2014 $999\n$1,199(save $200)Apple MacBook Air, 15-inch (M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $1,199\n$1,399(save $200)Apple MacBook Air, 15-inch (M4, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $1,399\n$1,599(save $200)\nMacBook Pro\nApple MacBook Pro, 14-inch (M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $1,299\n$1,599(save $300)Apple MacBook Pro, 14-inch (M4, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,499\n$1,799(save $300)Apple MacBook Pro, 14-inch (M4, 24GB RAM, 1TB SSD) \u2014 $1,699\n$1,999(save $300)Apple MacBook Pro, 14-inch (M4 Pro, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $1,699\n$1,999(save $300)Apple MacBook Pro, 16-inch (M4 Pro, 24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) \u2014 $2,228.99 $2,499 (save $270.01)\nBest iPad deal\nWhy we like it\nCheck out our full review of the M3 iPad Air.\n\"Apple's new iPad Air doesn't feel very new, as the only major difference is the new M3 chip,\" Mashable's reviewer writes of the M3 iPad Air released earlier this year. That's not a bad thing, though. Besides the hefty new processor that unlocks Apple Intelligence, the M3 Air features better battery life, a more advanced Magic Keyboard (optional add-on), and pass-through charging. We think it's the best iPad option for more people, especially now that it's down to just $449 at Amazon.

While these don't offer noise cancellation (that'll cost you another $49), our reviewer was extremely impressed with their sound. They last a little longer than the noise-cancelling option at about five hours per charge (30 with the charging case), making them a great daily driver.

This is only the second time the buds have dropped below the $90 threshold.\nGet this Labor Day deal right here.\nBest iPad Air Deal: \"Apple's new iPad Air doesn't feel very new, as the only major difference is the new M3 chip,\" Mashable's reviewer writes of the M3 iPad Air released earlier this year. That's not a bad thing, though. Besides the hefty new processor that unlocks Apple Intelligence, the M3 Air features better battery life, a more advanced Magic Keyboard (optional add-on), and pass-through charging. We think it's the best iPad option for more people, especially now that it's down to just $449 at Amazon. That's its best price on record.\nGet this limited-time offer here.\nChristina Buff is a Nashville-based freelance writer for who covers shopping with a splash of entertainment.

YOU MUST CLICK ON THE PROMOTION LINK FOR THE REWARDS OFFER DURING THE SAME SHOPPING SESSION THAT YOU COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE FROM THE MERCHANT. THE PURCHASE MUST BE MADE IN US DOLLARS.

YOU MUST NOT ENABLE AN AD BLOCKER OR OTHERWISE DISABLE COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER, BECAUSE COOKIES ARE USED TO AUTHENTICATE YOUR PURCHASE. RetailMeNot In-Store Cash Back Rewards. To earn Rewards pursuant to a Rewards O\ufb00er for In-Store Cash Back Rewards by submitting a Receipt, you must: (1) Activate the Rewards O\ufb00er, if applicable; (2) complete the required purchase via a Quali\ufb01ed Transaction; (3) submit a valid, readable Receipt through the Promotion Landing Page in accordance with the stated terms; and (4) satisfy any and all other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card. If you complete the obligations in Sections 4(b)(i) and 4(b)(ii) and the Reward Offer is still available, the Reward specified for the applicable Reward Offer will be considered an Approved Award. RetailMeNot Receipt Scanning. You agree to at all times provide accurate and complete information to RetailMeNot. You agree not to: submit a Receipt that is false, inaccurate, fabricated, counterfeited, incomplete, tampered with, adjusted, or otherwise inauthentic for the purpose of seeking to claim a Reward; redeem, or attempt to redeem, a Reward for products that have not actually been purchased, or for products that have been returned; submit or attempt to submit a Receipt that has already been submitted or used by you or another user; or submit Receipts outside of a Promotion Period, or for a purchase that took place prior to or after the launch date of a Rewards O\ufb00er. RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20. Privacy Policy The applicable privacy policy will be made available on the property from which you accessed these Terms. Such privacy policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms.
