  "content": "JOUMANNA: NINE. THIS IS HORIZONS MENTALLY AND AFRICA -- MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. WEAK U.S. JOBS OPENING DATA REINFORCES BETS ON A FED RATE CUT. CHRISTOPHER WALLER SAYS THE CENTRAL BANK SHOULD CUT THIS MONTH AND CONTINUE. CHINESE STOCKS SLUMP. CONCERNS ABOUT A RAPID $1.2 TRILLION RALLY MOUNTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKS THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD HIS GLOBAL TERRACE AFTER A COURT RULING DEEMS THEM THE LEGAL. 8:00 A.M. ACROSS THE EMIRATES. THINGS STABILIZED OVERNIGHT FOR U.S. TREASURIES, WE SAW A GLOBAL FIXED INCOME RALLY BACK SO THAT WAS THE BIG STORY YESTERDAY. WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN, THE LAW OF GRAVITY AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING THIS MORNING, RALLIED SIX BASIS POINTS, 10 YEAR YIELDS 4.22 SO SOME CALM BEING RESTORED IN THE MARKETS. S & P LEADING TOWARDS THE GREEN, THE NASDAQ ENDED THE SESSION UP 1% HIGHER YESTERDAY, VERY STRONG PRICE ACTION IN THE HEALTH OF THAT AS WE SPOKE ABOUT YESTERDAY WITH THE ANTITRUST RULING IN THEIR FAVOR ON CHROME AND THE SEARCH ENGINE. SO THAT STOCK WAS UP 9%. U.S. STOCK FUTURES LEANING SIDEWAYS, BUT IN LINE WITH GLOBAL FIXED INCOME RALLY. WE ARE SHAPING UP TO SEE A BETTER POSITIVE SESSION IN EUROPEAN EQUITIES AS WELL. BRENT IN FOCUS, 67 DOLLARS, DOWN ZERO POINT 7%, HEADED TO AN OPEC-PLUS VIRTUAL MEETING THIS WEEKEND. WILL MORE PRODUCTION BE PUT BACK TO THE TABLE? ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS FOR THE INVESTORS AS GOLDMAN SACHS AND OTHERS MAINTAIN A BEARISH VIEW ON THE PRICE OF OIL. GOLDMAN SAYS IT COULD GET TO LOW TO MID 50'S BY 2026. WE HAVE SPENT TIME TALKING ABOUT THE MONEY POURING INTO GOLD. TAKE A LOOK AT THE INFLOWS. MAINLY, THIS CHART ENCAPSULATES HOW MUCH MONEY GOING INTO GOLD ETF SEND IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS, EXTREME AMOUNT OF VOLUME HAS GONE INTO THAT SPACE AS WE SPEAK ABOUT GOLD MAKING NEW RECORD HIGHS, REACHING $3500. IT IS ALSO SILVER, THE HIGHEST LEVELS SINCE 2011, BREAKING $40 PER OUNCE. GOLD AND SILVER, BENEFITING FROM ALL THE GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY AND ALSO, THE EXPECTED FED RATE CUTTING CYCLE. LET'S CHECK MARKETS IN ASIA. ANNABELLE, I TALKED ABOUT THE GLOBAL FIXED INCOME RALLY BUT WE HAD AN IMPORTANT 30 YEAR JGB AUCTION. ANNABELLE: COMING INTO THIS SESSION THIS WAS ONE OF THE KEY THEMES WE WILL TRACK BECAUSE THIS JAPAN 30 YEAR BOND SALE, LOTS OF QUESTIONS, WHAT WAS THE DEMAND GOING TO LOOK LIKE? YOU HAVE HAD GLOBAL GYRATIONS, CONCERNS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND IF GOVERNMENTS WILL BE PREPARED TO REIN IN SPENDING WORLDWIDE. IN JAPAN, DOMESTIC PRESSURES AND QUESTIONS AROUND HOW LONG THE PRIME MINISTER CAN HOLD ONTO POWER. . WOULD THERE BE MOVES AS WELL? FOR HIM TO BE STEPPING DOWN? SO THAT IS PLAYING INTO THE DYNAMICS TODAY. READING BELOW THREE ON THE BID TO COVER RATIO, INTERPRETED AS BAD FOR MARKETS BUT IT CAME IN AROUND THE 12 MONTH AVERAGE SO THE BID TO COVER RATIO IS 3.31, LOWER THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE PAST TWO AUCTIONS BUT WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO THE 12 MONTH AVERAGE, AROUND THE 31 INTERPRETED AS NOT FAR AWAY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE DOMESTIC DYNAMICS. OFF THE BACK OF THAT, THE 30 YEAR A LITTLE LOWER, EQUITIES RISING, TOPIX THE BIG BENEFICIARY. I MENTIONED JAPAN WAS THE THEME COMING INTO THE SESSION BUT THERE IS A STORY THAT IS PROBABLY, IT IS RUNNING ON A PAR TODAY, THIS IS A BLOOMBERG'S SCOOP, CHINA IS LOOKING AT WAYS TO CURB THIS HUGE RALLY WE ARE SEEING IN STOCKS. TALKING A 1.2 TRILLION DOLLAR RALLY SINCE THE START OF AUGUST IN CHINA. OUR AUTHORITIES AND REGULATORS IN CHINA CONCERNED WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR, TOO FAST? THEY COULD BE LOOKING AT CURBING SPECULATE OF TRADING, LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT OF MARGIN TRADING WE ARE SEEING. THAT IS HAVING A BIG BEARING ON WHAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF TRADING BECAUSE THIS REPORT HAS BEEN ENOUGH TO CURB IN A LOT OF THE MARKET. LOTS OF MOVES TO THE DOWNSIDE AND YOU SEE IT IMPACTING SOME OF THESE STOCKS, GROWTH INNOVATION LED STOCKS BEING BIG BENEFICIARIES OF THE PAST FEW WEEKS. JOUMANNA: AS ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES PUT IT, IT IS TRANSITIONING TO A SELF CURBING MECHANISM. THANK YOU, ANNABELLE, FOR THE UPDATE. A BIG STORY IN CHINA DRIVING PRICE ACTION OVER THERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ASKING THE SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD HIS GLOBAL TARIFFS AND HE FAST TRACKED -- IN A FAST-TRACK CASE THAT COULD RESHAPE TRADE POLICY. CLEARLY, THE PRESIDENT WANTS CLARITY ON THE TARIFF SITUATION. WHAT IS THE FILING TELL US ABOUT WHERE THE CASE COULD GO? > > WHITE HOUSE WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE SUPREME COURT WHEN APPEALING THE CASE. THERE ARE TAKEAWAYS FROM THE FILING THAT WE FOUND OUT. THEY ARE ASKING FOR AN EXPEDITED PROCEDURE, ARGUMENTS TO START IN NOVEMBER WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE COURT TO RULE BY THE END OF THE YEAR, WHICH GIVES US A TIMELINE. WE WILL FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S LEGAL STRATEGY. THEY ARGUE THAT STRIKING DOWN THE TARIFFS WOULD CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM TO THE U.S. ECONOMY AND IT WOULD CAST A PALL OVER THE PLANNING AND POLICIES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND IT WOULD BE ADMINISTRATION OF ITS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO TRADE THREATS. . AS FOR THE CASE, THEY ARGUED THEY U.S. TRADE DEFICIT CONSTITUTES AN ECONOMIC EMERGENCY, WHICH IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT USED AS THE BASIS OF HIS AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE TARIFFS. THAT IS WHAT THE LOWER COURTS FOUND HE DID NOT HAVE. THAT WILL BE AT THE HEART OF THE CASE WHEN THE SUPREME COURT STARTS DELIBERATIONS. JOUMANNA: IF, AND THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION BUT IF THE SUPREME COURT RULES ALONGSIDE THE LOWER COURTS THAT THE TARIFFS ARE ILLEGAL, ONE KNOCK ON EFFECT WILL THAT HAVE ON NEW TRADE DEALS THE U.S. HAS INKED WITH VARIOUS COUNTRIES? BALAZS: THE PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY STRIKING DOWN THE TARIFFS WOULD BE UNWINDING THE TRADE DEALS, AND REMEMBER A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT FROM ALL SIDES WENT INTO GETTING THE TRADE DEALS. ON THE FACE OF IT, NO TARIFFS, NO PROBLEM, RIGHT? THE U.S. HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFS IN THE PAST 100 YEARS AFTER THE TRADE DEALS. ON THE FACE OF IT, THAT COULD BE SEEN AS A RELIEF FOR THOSE COUNTRIES, BUT WE KNOW THE U.S. HAS SEVERAL AVENUES TO TRY TO GET BACK TO TARIFFS, TO REIMPOSE THEM THROUGH OTHER LEGAL MECHANISMS. LIKELY, THAT WOULD SET OFF A NEW ROUND OF UNCERTAINTY AND THESE COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE POTENTIALLY TO TRY TO GET THE SAME DEALS. IT WOULD OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW PHASE OF INSTABILITY AND GLOBAL TRADE AND WOULD BE ANOTHER THREAT OF INSTABILITY FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. JOUMANNA: UNCERTAINTY SEEMS TO BE THE THEME OF THIS YEAR, AND DESPITE THAT MARKETS MEET NEW HIGHS. SPEAKING OF MARKETS, ST. LOUIS' FED PRESIDENT SAID INTEREST RATES ARE WELL POSITIONED FOR THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. TRADERS ARE BETTING ON A RATE CUT BUT HE SAYS HE WANTS MORE DATA BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. > > THE CURRENT SETTING OF THE POLICY RATE IS CONSISTENT WITH TODAY'S FULL EMPLOYMENT LABOR MARKET AND CORE INFLATION NEARLY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE FED'S 2% TARGET. LOOKING AHEAD, I EXPECT THE LABOR MARKET TO GRADUALLY LAND REMAIN AT FULL EMPLOYMENT WITH RISKS TILTED TO THE DOWNSIDE. JOUMANNA: THAT WAS THE ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT. WE HAD COMMENTS FROM CHRISTOPHER WALLER, ONE OF THE FRONT RUNNERS TO SUCCEED THE FED, SPEAKING DEVILISHLY. TO DISCUSS THIS IS THE HEAD OF FIXED INCOME. LET'S START WITH THE GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ROUTE THIS WEEK THAT WERE COVERED YESTERDAY. WHAT DO YOU POINT THAT DOWN TO? WHY DID WE GET AN UPSET ON THE FIRST TRADING DAY IN THE U.S. THIS WEEK? > > BACK. -- GOOD TO BE BACK. THE REASONS ARE NOT INFLATION. WITH THE U.S. AND THE REST OF THE WORLD I THINK IT IS SUPPLY DYNAMICS AND AN INCREASE IN TERM PREMIUM. BUT ZOOM OUT AND LOOK AT THE DRIVERS FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY, THERE IS DISINFLATION. SO THE IMPACT OF AI, SUBDUED ENERGY PRACTICE -- PRICES, WE STILL THINK THAT WILL DRIVE THE LONG-TERM PRICE ACTION ON U.S. TREASURY YIELDS. JOUMANNA: ARE YOU A BUYER OF FIXED INCOME? AMOL: ABSOLUTELY. WE LIKE CURRENT LEVELS AT CYCLE HIGHS. NATURALLY WE ARE EXTENDING THE DURATION ACROSS THE CURVE, 5-10 YEAR IS A GOOD SPOT TO CLIP COUPONS AND WAIT FOR A DOVISH MONETARY POLICY TO PLAY IN OUR FAVOR. JOUMANNA: MOST INVESTORS WE SPEAK TO DON'T WANT TO OWN LONG-DURATION IN THE U.S.. ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE TIDE MOVING AGAINST YOU? AMOL: GREAT QUESTION. YOU ARE TALKING, IT IS ABOUT 130 BASIS POINTS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT 21, 22, IT HAS STEEPENED BY 250 BASIS POINTS SO THE BIG MOVES ARE BEHIND US. I THINK WE NEED TO DIP OUR TOES IN AND LOOK AT THE LONG END. WE CAN'T AVOID THIS. JOUMANNA: SO THAT IS YOUR LONG-DURATION BIAS. LET'S TRANSLATE THAT TO CREDIT BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT HOW TIGHT SOME CREDIT SPREADS ARE TRADING AND CORPORATE CREDIT AND SOVEREIGN CREDIT. HOW ARE YOU IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES SPECIFICALLY IN THIS REGION? AMOL: AS I SAID, SPREADS ARE DECADE HIGHS ACROSS THE BOARD. GCC, EMERGING MARKETS AND SUCH. IF YOU LOOK AT THE EU, MULTI-DECADE HIGHS AS WELL SO I THINK IF YOU LACK IN 5%, 6% FOR 5-10 YEAR DURATION, THAT IS AN INTERESTING PROPOSITION AT THIS POINT. INCOME IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT PLAY OUT THIS YEAR AND THE PREVIOUS YEAR AS WELL. JOUMANNA: THE BIG QUESTION FOR THIS REGION IS SAUDI ARABIA AND THE HUGE FISCAL ISSUANCES ANTICIPATED YESTERDAY. WE HAD THE FIVE AND 10 YEAR MASSIVELY OVERSUBSCRIBED. INVESTORS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS PAPER DESPITE THE WORSENING FISCAL DYNAMICS IN SAUDI ARABIA. WHY IS THAT THE CASE? AMOL: IF YOU LOOK AT SAUDI ARABIA, IT IS A STRONG STORY. TALKING ABOUT AN A PLUS RATED ECONOMY, DEBT TO GDP 30%, IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THE ISSUANCE LEVEL TILL 2030, THE MARKET IS PREDICTING 35-40% LEVEL AND THAT IS NOT TOO HIGH FOR THIS RATED ECONOMY. IF YOU LOOK AT INTEREST EXPENSES TO REVENUE, IT IS 4%. ASSET BALANCE IS 50% AND IF YOU LOOK AT A PLUS RATED CREDITS WITHIN EM THAT NUMBER IS 35%. . IF YOU LOOK AT THE FUNDAMENTAL PICTURE AS A WHOLE, IT IS CONSTRUCTIVE AND THE ISSUANCE, BECAUSE OF THE FORMATTED BENEFITS FROM SOLID TECHNICAL BACKDROP AS WELL. THERE IS HIGH DEMAND AND LIMITED SUPPLY FOR A RATED OR HIGH QUALITY ASSURANCES. JOUMANNA: WE HAVE SPENT TIME REPORTING ON MEGAPROJECTS SAUDI ARABIA HAD TO DOWNSIDE -- DOWNSIZE ON, THE WINTER OLYMPICS OR RE-PRIORITIZATION OF SPENDING PROJECTS. . DOES THAT MAKE INVESTORS WARY ABOUT THE EXTENT OF HOW MUCH PHYSICAL TIGHTENING IS TO COME? MATTER SAUDI ARABIA AND THE KNOCK ON EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN COMING YEARS? AMOL: THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAUDI ARABIA BOND CURVE, PEOPLE ARE HESITANT THAT THE LONG END OF THE CURVE. IT IS LACK OF DEMAND, AND CONSIDERING THE MACRO BACKDROP, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PLACE BETS ON THAT. AS A RESULT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUANCE THIS YEAR, IT IS BEEN A 5-10 YEAR BUCKET, WHICH THEY DID IN A PREVIOUS YEARS 05-10 YEAR BUCKET IS STILL THE CHEAPEST RISK IN EM AND CONSIDERING THE PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY, YOU CAN LOOK PAST THIS. JOUMANNA: BEYOND SAUDI ARABIA THERE HAS BEEN A TON OF CREDIT ENSURE -- ISSUANCE. AMOL: WE HAVE 93 BILLION DOLLARS OF HARD CURRENCY ISSUANCE IN MINA. WE EXPECTED 125 BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR, 15% MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND A RECORD YEAR FOR HARD CURRENCIES. WE EXPECT THIS KIND OF RANGE NEXT YEAR AS WELL, CONSIDERING. JOUMANNA:JOUMANNA: THERE IS DEMAND FOR THIS PAPER AND THAT IS THE POINT ALTHOUGH THERE IS MORE OF IT COMING. SAUDI ARABIA IS MASSIVELY OVERSUBSCRIBED ON THE BUS. > > THEY ARE BUYING FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES, FUND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, RETAIL INVESTORS AND YOU ARE SEEING THREE OR FOUR TIMES FOR MOST OF THESE ISSUERS. THERE IS A SENSE THAT THERE WILL BE A DEMAND IN PLAY EVEN IF SUPPLY GOES UP FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. JOUMANNA: GOOD TO CHAT WITH YOU. WHEN THE UAE WARNS ISRAEL ANNEXING THE WEST BANK LAND WOULD RECONSTITUTE A REDLINE. WE HAVE THE DETAILS NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JOUMANNA: WELCOME BACK TO HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA. THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES WARNED ISRAEL ANNEXATION OF PALESTINIAN TERRITORY IN THE WEST BANK WOULD CONSTITUTE A REDLINE. THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS SAYS TAKING OVER PALESTINIAN TERRITORY WOULD SEVERELY UNDERMINE THE VISION AND SPIRIT OF U.S. BROKERED ABRAHAM ACCORDS. JOINING US IS EUROPE'S -- IS BLOOMBERG'S UAE BUREAU CHIEF. IT IS RARE FOR THE UAE ESPECIALLY THE UAE TO MAKE STATEMENTS LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT ISRAEL IS POTENTIALLY CROSSING THE LINE. HOW SHOULD WE READ THIS? HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT THAT THE UAE IS SENDING A PUBLIC MESSAGE TO ISRAEL AND THE WORLD THAT THE ANNEXATION OF THE WEST BANK WOULD BE A REDLINE? > > LIKE YOU SAID, TO ISRAEL PUBLICLY BUT ALSO TO THE U.S.. THIS IS THE STRONGEST STANCE THE UAE HAS TAKEN SINCE THE WAR STARTED TWO YEARS AGO. THE UAE HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE, THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT. THIS OF COURSE BECAUSE THE WEST BANK IS A REDLINE AND WHEN THE UAE SIGNED THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS, THE WEST BANK WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE FUTURE PALESTINIAN STATE AND THAT IS WHAT THEY AGREED WHEN THEY SIGNED. I THINK THEY UAE IS TRYING TO SHOW THAT THERE IS A REDLINE. IN HER COMMENTS, SHE DIDN'T SPECIFY WHETHER THAT MEANS SEVERING DIPLOMATIC TIES OR WHAT THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE OR HOW WE SHOULD TRANSLATE THOSE RED LINES THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. THE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN UNDER HEAVY STRAIN. LAST MONTH, NETANYAHU DISPATCHED HIS TOP AIDE SPEAK TO THE UAE OFFICIALS AND WE KNOW HE SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UAE, AND THAT WAS ABOUT TAKING OVER GAZA CITY OR THEIR PLANS FROM LAST AND WEST BANK. ANNEXATION SINCE NETANYAHU TOOK POWER AGAIN WITH HIS ULTRANATIONALIST COALITION, THE WEST BANK HAS BEEN A TOPIC. THEY WANT TO ANNEX THAT AND THIS IS AFTER THE FINANCE MINISTERS COMMENT THAT HE WANTS TO ANNEX SO-CALLED OPEN AREAS OF THE WEST BANK. JOUMANNA: NETANYAHU IS UNDER PRESSURE FROM MEMBERS OF THE COALITION. HE HAS AN ELECTION TO THINK ABOUT. LET ME ZOOM OUT BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS A WIDER DREAM FOR THE REGION OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION SIGNING ONTO ABRAHAM ACCORDS. THERE WERE REPORTS ABOUT NORMALIZATION TALKS WITH SYRIA, POTENTIALLY WITH LEBANON AS WELL. THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THE POSTER CHILD OF THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS SAYING ISRAEL ARE CLOSE TO CROSSING A REDLINE, WHAT BEARING DOES THAT HAVE ON OTHER COUNTRIES POTENTIALLY SIGNING ON? DANA: SHE SAID UNDERMINES THE VISION AND THE SPIRIT OF THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS. THAT WOULD DEFINITELY DELIVER A HEAVY BLOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'S MAIN FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVE IN THE REGION, TO INTEGRATE ISRAEL BETTER INTO THE MIDDLE EAST AND EXPAND THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS TO INCLUDE THE LIKES OF SAUDI ARABIA. WITH SYRIA AND ALL OF THE COUNTRIES, EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT WHAT THE UAE WILL DO AND WHAT THE REDLINE WOULD BE. IT UNDERMINES THE FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVE OF TRUMP. JOUMANNA: THANK YOU FOR THE REPORTING. DANA. BRING UP, DONNA'S INFLATION COOLS TO ITS -- COMING UP, GHANA'S INFLATION COOLS TO ITS LOWEST LEVELS IN YEARS. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. JOUMANNA: GHANA'S INFLATION RATE FALLS TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN ALMOST FOUR YEARS. THIS MAY ENCOURAGE THE CENTRAL BANK TO LOWER INTEREST RATES. JENNIFER JOINS US FROM JOHANNESBURG. ULTIMATELY THE CENTRAL BANK IS FOLLOWING THE QS COMING FROM THE INFLATION RATES. HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT FOLLOWING ON FROM THIS THE GHANA WILL CENTRAL BANK -- CENTRAL BANK WILL CUT RATES? JENNIFER: IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PRINT WE GOT ON WEDNESDAY, THE LOWEST IN NEARLY FOUR YEARS AND ALSO AN EIGHTH STRAIGHT MONTH OF DECLINES, THIS IS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND FOR A COUNTRY THAT HAD BEEN COMING OUT OF AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE LAST TIME WE SAW THE MPC MEETING IN GHANA, THEY SLASHED THE KEY INTEREST RATE BY 300 BASIS POINTS AND IT IS LOOKING MORE LIKELY. WE HEAR FROM ANALYSTS AND ECONOMISTS THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY IF, IT IS BY HOW MUCH. IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR IN THE PAST FEW MEETINGS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE DATA BECAUSE HE NOTES IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT POTENTIALLY THE HEADWINDS THE ECONOMY COULD FACE, AND AS HE SAYS, SECOND ROUND EFFECT SHOCKS, EXTERNAL SHOCKS. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT DRIVEN ECONOMY. THEY IMPORT A NUMBER OF THINGS INTO THE ECONOMY DESPITE PRODUCING GOLD, OIL AND COCOA. IT STILL HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT FOR THE ECONOMY TO FOCUS ON IMPORTING. THAT COULD AFFECT WHAT WE SEE WITH INFLATION AND WHAT GHANIANS ARE PAYING. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT THE CENTRAL BANK SAID OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THEY EXPECT INFLATION TO GET BACK TO THE 6-10% TARGET RANGE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND REALLY, THEN IT IS A MATTER OF MANAGING ANY SEASONAL PRESSURE THEY MAY FACE, NOT JUST FROM IMPORTING BUT ALSO, IN PARTICULAR, WHEN IT COMES TO THE CURRENCY WHICH HAS COME UNDER PRESSURE OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS. JOUMANNA: LET ME ASK ABOUT THAT. IN THE FIRST QUARTER -- THIRD QUARTER IT HAS BEEN ROUGH FOR THE CURRENCY. WHAT IS GOING ON? JENNIFER: IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE CURRENCY, IT WENT FROM BEING THE WORLD'S BEST PERFORMING CURRENCY A FEW MONTHS AGO NEXT TO THE RUSSIAN RUBLE, TO NOW OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, THE THIRD QUARTER HAS BEEN DETRIMENTAL FOR THE CURRENCY AND A LOT OF THAT GOES BACK TO THE IMPORTS AND THE DEMAND FOR DOLLARS THAT WE ARE SEEING LOCALLY. WE HAVE SEEN THE CURRENCY DEPRECIATE FOR A NINTH DAY, AND EIGHTH DAY IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLOOMBERG REALLY AND A NINTH DAY AGAINST THE DOLLAR. THE QUESTION IS, WILL DISCONTINUE, WILL WE SEE MORE PRESSURE AS WE MOVE INTO THE HOLIDAYS? JOUMANNA: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK IN A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT MIDDLE EAST TRENDS. JOUMANNA: GOOD MORNING. . THIS IS HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA. TREASURIES REBOUND AS WEAK U.S. JOB OPENINGS DATA REINFORCES BETS ON A FED RATE CUT. CHRISTOPHER WALLER SAYS THE CENTRAL BANK SHOULD CUT THIS MONTH AND CONTINUE. CHINESE STOCKS SLUMP AS BEIJING WEIGHS MEASURES TO COOL MARKET SPECULATION HAS CONCERNS ABOUT A RAPID $1.2 TRILLION RALLY MOUNT. PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKS THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD TARIFFS AFTER A FEDERAL COURT RULING DEEMS THEM ILLEGAL. H: 30 IN THE EMIRATES, I'M JOUMANNA BERCETCHE. POSITIVE PRICE ACTION FOR GLOBAL MARKETS, WALL STREET ENDED IN THE GREEN, SAME FOR EUROPEAN MARKETS SO STABILIZATION VERSUS THE PRIOR DAY. TODAY, LEANING TOWARDS GREEN AS WELL. WE GET CLOSER TO THE JOBS REPORT COMING THROUGH FRIDAY. YESTERDAY'S JOBS OPENING CAME AS A BIT OF A NEGATIVE SURPRISE TO THOSE WATCHING LABOR MARKET DATA, SHOWING THE NUMBERS ARE THE WEAKEST AND I WOULD SAY GOING BACK TO 10 MONTHS. THAT IS THE WEAKEST DATA IN 10 MONTHS ON THE JOBS OPENING FRONT IN THE U.S., SETTING THE SCENE FOR THE NUMBERS COMING THROUGH ON FRIDAY. 10 YEAR YIELDS, FIXED INCOME RALLY BACK, TREASURIES SITTING AT 4.22%, DOWN SIX BASIS POINTS ON THE DAY YESTERDAY AND BRENT IN FOCUS, DOWN 0.6%. WE WILL PICK THAT UP SHORTLY AND TALK ABOUT THE DRIVERS. SWITCHING OVERCOME OF THE PAST COUPLE DAYS, TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THE MONEY GOING INTO SAFE HAVENS AND GOLD MAKING GET ANOTHER RECORD HIGH, BREAKING $2500. SILVER MAKING A NEW HIGH NOT SEEN SINCE 2011 THROUGH $40 PER OUNCE. THE GOLD ETF COMPLEX HAS SEEN HUGE INFLOWS THROUGH AUGUST, PERHAPS ANTICIPATING THE FED EASING CYCLE AND INFLATIONARY PRESSURE FROM TARIFFS. . SO ALL OF THAT HAS AIDED THE PRICE OF GOLD. LET'S CHECK HOW MARKETS IN ASIA ARE FARING. ANNABELLE HAS A SCOOP SUGGESTING CHINA'S AUTHORITIES ARE WEIGHING CURBS TO REIN IN THE CHINESE STOCK MARKET. THERE HAS BEEN QUITE THE RALLY IN AUGUST. ANNABELLE: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT $1.2 TRILLION IN MARKET CAP ADDED IN THE SPACE OF A FEW WEEKS. THAT HAS BEEN A PRIMARY CONCERN FOR REGULATORS. IS IT MOVING TOO FAST, TOO FAR, RATHER, TOO FAST? CHINA LIKELY WANTS TO SEE A MORE GRADUAL BULL MARKET EVOLVING AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE. THE SCOOP THIS MORNING TALKS ABOUT MAYBE THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT MEASURES TO SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT. MAISIE -- MAYBE CURB SPECULATING . -- SPECULATIVE TRADING WE HAVE HAD CURBS ON SHORTSELLING OF THOSE COULD BE REMOVED. SO THESE ARE THE MEASURES WE ARE HEARING ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN MAINLAND CHINA. IT IS A CASE OF, SELLING THE RUMOR AND THINKING ABOUT THE FACTS LATER BECAUSE YOU ARE SEEING A HUGE SELLOFF ACROSS THE BOARD. PARTICULARLY ON MORE INNOVATION GROWTH LED INDICES. IT IS ALSO SHOWING UP IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE MARKET THAT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIARIES OUT OF THE RALLY. SEMICONDUCTOR STOCKS, CAMERA CON IS A NAME THAT IS UNKNOWN TO MANY PEOPLE UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO BUT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AS AN NVIDIA COMPETITOR. IT IS A FAR CRY FROM THAT, BUT YOU ARE SEEING THAT SELLING DOWN, GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE INVESTORS MAY BE MOVING OUT OF MORE GROWTH LED NAMES. WE ARE SEEING UPSIDE IN THE SOLAR SPACE BECAUSE OVERNIGHT, BLOOMBERG HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH A SOLAR COMPANY, THE CFO TALKING ABOUT MEASURES TO CURB OVERCAPACITY INSULAR IN CHINA. THAT COULD BUILD INTO. THE EARNINGS PICTURE MOVING FORWARD. THE STOCK CLOSED HIGHER BUT IT IS HAVING A BIG BEARING ON SOLAR MEANS BECAUSE THE CSI 300, 250 ARE IN THE RED. I HANDFUL ARE IN THE GREEN AND IT IS SOLAR THAT IS LEADING TO THE UPSIDE. JOUMANNA: FOR A CHANGE I WOULD SAY. ANNABELLE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE LATEST. OIL DROPPED FOR A SECOND DAY AS TRADERS FRETTED THAT OPEC-PLUS MAY BOOST SUPPLY ONCE AGAIN. THIS COMES AS GOLDMAN SACHS SAYS BRENT IS SET TO DROP TO THE 50'S NEXT YEAR ON A GLOBAL SURPLUS. JOINING US IS BLOOMBERG'S WILL -- OIL REPORTER. IT FEELS LIKE THE MARKET SENTIMENT TOWARDS OIL IS TURNING BEARISH. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE CONSENSUS AMONG ANALYSTS? NICHOLAS: I THINK THE BIG STORY THAT PEOPLE ARE CONTENDING WITH, NOT JUST AS WE MOVE INTO THE FOURTH ORDER BUT AS GOLDMAN SACHS IS SAYING, INTO NEXT YEAR, THE BIG ISSUE IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN OPEC BRING BACK SO MANY BARRELS. 2.5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY THEY FAST TRACKED AND THAT HAS BEEN RETURNED. EYES ARE LOOKING AT WHAT THEY WILL DO THIS WEEKEND. IN ADDITION, GOLDMAN SACHS, TRADITIONALLY BULLISH ON OIL, IN THIS CASE SEEING THINGS MORE BEARISH MOVING INTO THE END OF NEXT YEAR. LOW 50'S NOW IS A FIGURE. JOUMANNA: WE HAVE ANOTHER OPEC-PLUS VIRTUAL MEETING COMING UP THIS WEEKEND. THEY FINISHED THE FIRST ROUND, COMPLETED THE FIRST ROUND PUTTING BACK VOLUNTARY CUTS BACK TO THE MARKET. ATTENTION WILL TURN TO THE SECOND CLIFF, 1.6 6 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY. WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION? NICHOLAS: I LIKE TO LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND I WOULD SAY THAT BRENT IS FALLING AFTER YESTERDAY. THERE WERE NEWS REPORTS YESTERDAY SAYING OPEC WOULD BRING SOME OF THE 1.6 6 MILLION BACK. BUT SINCE THEN WE HAVE CHECKED WITH OUR SOURCES AND WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS OPEC IS PLAYING ITS CARDS CLOSE TO HIS CHEST. ALL OPTIONS REMAIN ON THE TABLE. IT IS NOT GUARANTEED THEY WILL RESTORE SUPPLY. MAINTAINING CURRENT LEVELS REMAINS ON THE TABLE. THE QUESTION REMAINS OPEN AS WE MOVE INTO THE END OF THE WEEKEND , HEADING INTO THE MEETING SUNDAY. JOUMANNA: ALL EYES ON THE MEETING. NICHOLAS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. BUSINESS ACTIVITY ACROSS MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN ECONOMIES SHOWED MIXED TRENDS FOR AUGUST. PMI DATA FROM S & P GLOBAL SHOWS THE UAE LEADING GROWTH WHILE KUWAIT AND EGYPT RECORDED CONTRACTIONS. JOINING US IS THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MASTERCARD ECONOMICS. BEFORE WE DELVE INTO DETAILS OF PMI NUMBERS FROM THE REGION, I WANT TO ASK ABOUT OIL, GIVEN THE OIL DYNAMICS WE TALKED ABOUT. A REPORTER WAS SAYING ANALYSTS EXPECTATION IS WE WILL SEE A SUPPLY GLUT IN Q4, BEGINNING OF Q1 THAT COULD PUSH DOWN ON OIL. HOW HAVE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION DONE THIS YEAR WITH THE WEAKER OIL BACKDROP? TALKING ABOUT OIL TRADING DOWN. > > THEY HAVE DONE PRETTY WELL, GIVEN THE VOLATILITY AROUND OIL PRICES AND THE SECOND QUARTER. WE WOUND UP WITH AN AVERAGE OIL PRICE AND THE FIRST HALF AROUND $70 PER BARREL. WE SAW SOME COUNTRIES NEEDING TO ISSUE MORE DEBT, SAUDI ARABIA IN PARTICULAR GOING TO MARKETS TO FINANCE THE BUDGET DEFICIT THEY WERE RUNNING. IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY, SO FAR IT HAS BEEN LIMITED. WE HAVE SEEN SOME CUTS TO CAPITAL INVESTMENT SPENDING IN SAUDI ARABIA, DOWN 30% IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THAT HAS BEEN OFFSET BY INCREASED PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT INCLUDING GOVERNMENT RELATED ENTITIES. THE INVESTMENT STORY CONTINUES AND THAT IS HELPING UNDERPIN DOMESTIC DEMAND, NOT JUST IN SAUDI ARABIA BUT ACROSS THE REGION. JOUMANNA: LET'S PICK UP ON RECENT PMI NUMBERS YESTERDAY. ONE OF THE NUMBERS THAT STUCK OUT TO ME, SAUDI ARABIA'S PMI COMING IN AT 56 HANDLE, 56.4. YOU HEAR STORIES ABOUT POTENTIAL SLOW DOWN IN SAUDI ARABIA, CUTTING SPENDING BUT PMI NUMBERS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY. KHATIJA: I THINK THAT IS REFLECTING PRIVATE SECTOR STEPPING IN AND HELPING COMPENSATE FOR BUDGET CUTS ON THE SIDE. PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT IS QUITE STRONG. THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT FUND IS DRIVING A LOT OF THESE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AS WELL. WHERE WE HAVE SEEN REPRIORITIZATION, IT STILL MEANS THERE IS INVESTMENT GOING ON, BUT IT IS MAY ON THE PROJECTS THAT ARE WERE WIRED IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIMEFRAME TO HOST GLOBAL EVENTS. THE OTHER STORY IN SAUDI ARABIA, CONSUMPTION IS STRONG. HOUSEHOLD SPENDING HAS BEEN ROBUST IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THE LATEST DATA FROM THE CENTRAL BANK SHOWS OVER 10% GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING FOR JULY ON A YEAR ON YEAR BASIS. THAT IS SUPPORTED BY JOB GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, SO THAT HELPS DRIVE POPULATION GROWTH IN THE KINGDOM OVERALL. WE ARE SEEING GREATER NUMBERS OF WOMEN ENTERING THE WORKFORCE, HELPING TO SUPPORT HOUSEHOLD INCOMES, THE RISE OF DOUBLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THIS IS POSITIVE FOR THE CONSUMER STORY IN SAUDI ARABIA. JOUMANNA: PEOPLE FORGET THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY HALLMARKS OF SAUDI 2030, THERE IS EMPHASIS ON MEGA PROJECTS BUT YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING, PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT, WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN THE WORKFORCE AND ALL OF THAT IS EVIDENTLY SHOWING UP IN PMI FIGURES. LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION AS IT PERTAINS TO, WE ASKED ABOUT OIL BUT I WANT TO ASK ABOUT TARIFFS. AND HOW THE REGION, SPECIFICALLY THE GCC HAS WEATHERED THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND TARIFFS. THEY WERE SPARED THE MOST EXTREME TARIFF RATES BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPACT ON GLOBAL SENTIMENT. KHATIJA: THE REGIONAL DYNAMICS ARE DIFFERENT. THE DIRECT IMPACT OF TARIFFS IS LIMITED FOR OUR REGION BECAUSE WE DON'T EXPORT A HUGE AMOUNT TO THE U.S. MOST OF OUR EXPORTS GO TO ASIA, CHINA AND EUROPE. THE IMPACT IS MORE SECOND ROUND, REFLECTED IN WEAKER DEMAND FOR OIL FROM OIL CONSUMING COUNTRIES IN ASIA, WEAKER EXPORT DEMAND AND IMPORT DEMAND FROM EUROPE SO THE MARKET FOR EXPORTS FROM EGYPT TO EUROPE IS PERHAPS SOFTER. THE EXTERNAL BACKDROP IS A LITTLE WEAKER AND THAT HAS SHOWN UP IN PMI SURVEYS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN EXPORT GROWTH SLOWED SHARPLY THIS YEAR. THAT IS OFFSET BY A STRONG DOMESTIC STORY, UNDERPINNED BY THE CONSUMPTION DYNAMICS AND INVESTMENT. JOUMANNA: ONE COUNTRY THAT STANDS OUT IN TERMS OF PMI MRS. AND SUBDUED PMI'S IS EGYPT. SUB 50, 49.2 YESTERDAY VERSUS ESTIMATES OF 49.5. WHAT IS GOING ON IN EGYPT? KHATIJA: A LOT OF THE DRAGS ON GROWTH HAVE COME FROM THE STRUCTURAL REFORMS EGYPT HAS GONE THROUGH OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS BUT WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE MOST OF THE HARD STUFF HAS BEEN BEDDED DOWN. WE ARE SEEING A RECOVERY IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND INVESTMENT IN EGYPT. THE SOCCER PMI'S ARE REFLECTING THE WEEK EXPORT STORY SO THE WEAK EUROPEAN DEMAND STORY SO WE ARE SEEING RATE CUTS FROM THE CENTRAL BANK IN EGYPT, 200 BASIS POINTS, AND IT IS SIGNIFICANT EASING FACILITATED BY SLOWER INFLATION FROM A STRONGER EGYPTIAN POUND, CONTINUED INVESTMENT FROM THE GULF, PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT AS WELL. THAT STORY IS CONSTRUCTED GOING FORWARD AND IN THE FIRST HALF, GDP FIGURES WERE OVER 5% IN TERMS OF H ONE GROWTH. SO I THINK OVERALL, THE STORY IS POSITIVE FOR EGYPT. JOUMANNA: PLEASURE TO CHAT WITH YOU. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US AN OVERVIEW ON THE MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES, GCC AND EGYPT, ARE DOING. A LOOK AT OTHER STORIES WE ARE FOLLOWING, SAUDI ARABIA AND THE U.K. ANNOUNCED JOINT INVESTMENT DEALS WORTH 360 MILLION POUNDS, UNVEILED AT THE GREAT FUTURE SUMMIT IN LONDON. THEY WILL SUPPORT INDUSTRIES FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO TECHNOLOGY AND SEEK THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FUNDS TO INVEST IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA. THE U.K. IS SEEKING TO LEVERAGE ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA TO WIN BUSINESS FOR BRITISH COMPANIES IN THE KINGDOM WHILE IT ATTRACTS INVESTMENT IN BRITAIN. LEBANON'S DIP -- DEFAULTED BONDS ROSE OVER $.20 ON THE DOLLAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS AS INVESTORS WAGER THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS ARE GAINING MOMENTUM. THE BONDS POSTED A TOTAL RETURN OF 250% SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER AND THIS COMES AFTER LEBANON PULLED BACK FROM A TWO YEAR LEADERSHIP VACUUM AND FORMED A FUNCTIONAL GOVERNMENT. COMING UP, TESLA SALES ARE PLUNGING ACROSS EUROPE AS THE ELECTRIC CAR DEMAND SURGES. THE BATTLE FOR EUROPE'S EV MARKET, AFTER THE BREAK. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a JOUMANNA: WELCOME BACK TO HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA. TESLA IS LOSING GROUND IN SOME OF EUROPE'S BIGGEST ELECTRIC WILL MARKETS. SALES ARE PLUNGING EVEN AS OVERALL EV DEMAND SURGES ACROSS THE CONTINENT. FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED BY BLOOMBERG'S DANNY LEE. LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS, NEW VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS FOR TESLA DROPPED 39% IN GERMANY, 56% FOR THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR. EUROPE IS INCREASINGLY A DIFFICULT MARKET FOR TESLA. WHAT WE .2 -- WHAT WE POINT TO? ? DANNY: MANY MARKETS HAVE SEEN A PRECIPITOUS DECLINE. THE ONLY MARKET WHERE TESLA HAS SEEN SALES GROWTH IS NORWAY, BUT GENERALLY, NORWAY IS A MARKET WERE ALMOST ALL OF ITS CAR SALES ARE EV'S SO IT DOES SEE A PICKUP FROM THE CONSUMERS WITH THAT KIND OF INTEREST. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BROADER CONSUMER STORY IN EUROPE, EV SALES ARE UP YEAR ON YEAR AND YEAR TO DATE, 26% SO TESLA IS STRUGGLING. IT IS A HYPERCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. IT IS NOT SEEING BENEFIT. ELON MUSK HAS BEEN PUTTING THAT DOWN TO A TRANSITION AND AN UPGRADE ON ITS BEST-SELLING MODEL Y VEHICLE. THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN SOME OF THE STEEP DROPS WE HAVE SEEN. WHETHER YOU BELIEVE HIM OR IF YOU LOOK AT THE REALITY ON THE GROUND, EVEN IN MARKETS LIKE SWEDEN WHERE THE MODEL Y HAS BEEN ON SALE, SALES HAVE DROPPED 87% SO THERE IS A BROADER STRUGGLE LET PLAY FOR TESLA, THAT DOESN'T DO HYBRIDS. JOUMANNA: I REMEMBER ONE PER REGISTRATION FIGURES DROPPED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, I WAS SURPRISED THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE HYBRID MARKET IN EUROPE. THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T HELP TESLA IN THIS CASE. YOU ALSO HAD STRONG SALES FIGURES COME THROUGH FROM VW, THEIR SALES HAVE SURGED IN EUROPE. WHAT IS BEHIND THAT UPTICK FOR VW? DANNY: THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE DOLDRUMS FOR A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THEIR FEET WITH EV STRATEGY, BUT NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO USE THE LEGACY, ONE OF THE LEGACY MODELS IN THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES, THE POLO, COMPACT HATCHBACK THAT IS PUTTING IN EV MODEL ONTO THE MARKET AND IT WILL USE THAT AS A DEFENSE AGAINST SOME OF THE WAVE OF CHINESE COMPETITION IN EUROPEAN MARKETS FROM BYD AND OTHERS. THAT WILL GO ON SALE NEXT YEAR FOR AROUND 25,000 EUROS OR JUST UNDER THAT. . THAT IS ABOUT 30,000 U.S. DOLLARS BUT HOPEFULLY USING THE LEGACY AROUND THAT, IT CAN TRANSITION INTO AN EV ERA. THIS COMES AT A TIME FOR VOLKSWAGEN WHERE EUROPEAN SALES OVERALL FOR AUTOS HAS BEEN SLUGGISH. THERE HAS BEEN HUGE COMPETITION FROM CHINA. AND OF COURSE THAT TRADE AND TARIFF NARRATIVE, WHICH HAS HURT ITS OUTLOOK. IT, WITH THE TAILWIND OF MORE OPTIMISTIC -- HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH THE TAILWIND OF MORE OPTIMISTIC SALES RECENTLY, IT CAN TRANSLATE THAT TO A NEW RELAUNCH OF EV'S. JOUMANNA: DANNY LEE, ALWAYS A PRESSURE THANKS -- ALWAYS A PLEASURE. THANKS FOR JOINING US. OTHER STORIES WE ARE FOLLOWING.

QATAR AIRWAYS SAYS ITS OUTLOOK REMAINS SOLID. SPEAKING TO AVRIL HONG IN HONG KONG, THE CHIEF COMMERCIAL OFFICER SAYS THE AIRLINE IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY TO ITS CUSTOMERS.
