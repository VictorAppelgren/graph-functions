Not just the one the world viewed through a carefully curated lens. We shared a quiet, sacred bond, one that could be seen and felt by anyone who witnessed us together.

I told him he had my support. I begged him to rest, to take care of himself. He had nothing else to prove to the world or anyone.\"\nBrooke shared that she and her husband, former NHL star Steven Olesky, moved to Florida to be closer to Hulk as he was facing health struggles.\n\"We had been through almost 25 surgeries together, and then all of a sudden he didn\u2019t want me at surgeries\u2026everything started getting covered in a thick veil,\" Brooke recalled. \"It was like there was a force field around him that I couldn\u2019t get through.\"\nHULK HOGAN ENDORSES TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT AT RNC: \u2018LET TRUMP-O-MANIA MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\u2019\n\"He was telling me these things, being so vulnerable with me and heard my pleas, then suddenly something shifted, and he made a choice to walk the path that clearly tore at his spirit,\" she continued. \"I felt a disconnect. What followed were respectful disagreements that took an emotional toll on me.\"\n\"During the last two years, I had to step away to protect my heart,\" Brooke added.\nHowever, Brooke shared that Olesky had maintained contact with Hulk in an effort to repair the relationship between his wife and her father. She explained that Olesky had been \"quietly reaching out to my dad without me knowing, trying to find a safe way back in for me. After my father passed, I read those messages, some answered, some ignored\u2026.but all of them broke my heart.\"\n\"I know in my heart I did everything I could,\" Brooke wrote. \"He knew I would run through a burning building for him.

      "text": "The WWE, or World Wrestling Entertainment Inc., is the world's largest professional wrestling promoter and a global media entertainment company. The company has two flagship television programs: Smackdown, which airs every Friday on Fox, and Monday Night Raw on the USA Network. The WWE also produces films and licenses its brand for video games and action figures. Every year, Wrestlemania and Summer Slam are the largest pay-per-view events for the WWE. The company's content is available in over 1 billion homes and brings over a billion in revenue annually. The headquarters for the WWE is located in Stamford, Connecticut, and it employs more than 800 people\nFounded in 1953 under Capital Wrestling Corporation, the company was acquired by Titan Sports Inc and changed its name to the World Wrestling Federation and later to its current brand in 2002. WWE's founder Vince McMahon holds a majority stake in the company at 36% and was its CEO from 1982 until his resignation in 2022. The company has affiliate offices worldwide in Los Angeles, Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai, Munch, and New York City. During McMahon's leadership, the company became a global entertainment and media group.\nAll wrestling content produced by the WWE is pre-staged performances that feature storylines, scripts, and pre-planned matches. Regardless, performers have still been seriously injured and even died in the ring. McMahon was forced to publicly acknowledge the staged aspects of its wrestling content in 1989. Officially, the company is branded as sports entertainment while having aspects of dramatized acting and wrestling. The WWE's most well-known performers include the Undertaker, John Cena, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, and Ric Flair.\nMcMahon resigned as the CEO in 2022 due to a company investigation into alleged misconduct.
