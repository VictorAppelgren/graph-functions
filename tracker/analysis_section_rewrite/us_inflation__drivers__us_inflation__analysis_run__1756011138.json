      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but needs tightening to reach world‑class rigor. Re‑structure it into a three‑section “macro‑policy‑commodity” framework: (1) **Inflation‑Fed nexus** – explicitly show how the July CPI 2.7 % (V7GV8YBQU) pushes the Fed funds rate to 4.5 % (C3ODMIQKZ), widening the U.S./Euro real‑rate gap to ~4 % and creating a 70 % chance of a 50 bp cut in September (C3ODMIQKZ). Quantify the downstream effects: a 50 bp cut → corporate spreads shrink 300–350 bp (GX057ADL7), equity P/E lift 2–3 pts, dollar falls 2–3 % (GX057ADL7). (2) **Commodity‑inflation feedback** – detail how OPEC+ + non‑OPEC oversupply (J99EM2TPZ) and IEA’s 2.5 m bpd 2025 supply growth keep crude below $70/bbl, easing energy‑heavy sector inflation and reducing the need for further rate hikes. Include a range for oil price (e.g., $65–$75) and its impact on the 10‑year Treasury yield (C3ODMIQKZ). (3) **Geopolitical & policy tailwinds** – separate Russia’s Kostiantynivka advance (7YQN9WX3K) and the 90‑day U.S.–China tariff truce (RHXDOHQQX) from the deregulation shift (9W8ZUIBDY). Quantify the defense/energy upside (e.g., 5–8 % P/E lift) and the tech margin improvement (e.g., 1–2 % cost reduction). For each driver, list a clear trigger (Fed meeting, CPI release, oil inventory report, Russia‑Ukraine front developments, tariff negotiations) and an invalidation scenario (Fed delay, oil demand rebound, geopolitical escalation). Tighten sentences, avoid run‑on clauses, and ensure every claim has a single, correctly formatted citation. End with a concise watch‑list: September Fed meeting, next CPI, weekly oil inventories, Russia‑Ukraine front status, U.S.–China tariff talks. This will sharpen the causal chain, improve quantification, and align the piece with the SECTION FOCUS.",
