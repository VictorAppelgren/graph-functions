  "content": "BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) \u2014 There have been a wide variety of pairings of detectives in film and television productions. Along with the traditional two males, teaming a man and woman has also proved popular.\n\nThere also have been shows where humans and dogs worked together to fight crime. The most diverse pairing was in the 1996 buddy cop movie where Whoopi Goldberg played a detective who worked with a Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nThe latest bringing together of mismatched partners can be seen on the new UPtv series \u201cThe Sunshine Murders\u201d scheduled to launch at 8 p.m. Sept. 4.\n\nThe series follows Shirley Rangi (Emily Corcoran), a New Zealand farmer searching for her missing father, who arrives in Athens to find her half-sister Helen Moustakas (Dora Chrysikou), a Greek detective struggling with her own family and career pressures. Though skeptical of Rangi\u2019s eccentricities, Moustakas discovers her \u201cbush wisdom\u201d proves surprisingly effective in solving crimes. Together, the sisters form an unlikely but formidable crime-fighting duo\u2014unraveling mysteries while navigating family ties.\n\nThe idea of bringing together characters from very different geographical points on the globe was easy for Corcoran \u2013 who not only stars but is also the executive producer \u2013 as she began writing the scripts. One of her best friends is Chrysikou.\n\n\u201cWe had got together and caught up because we\u2019ve gone to drama school together. This is about a year or so ago,\u201d Corcoran says. \u201cDora has become very famous in Greece and really successful. And I said, we\u2019ve got to do something together. From that planted seed it just sprang and evolved into the series. I started to speak to Channel 5 in the UK and other funders. Initially, it was going to be in the UK but ended up based in Greece.\u201d\n\nThe Greek setting is another way this latest detective tale has separated itself from the growing number of whodunit television series. Although most of the series was shot in Cyprus there were scenes filming in Athens and New Zealand. The dramatic differences between the locations help fortify how different these potential crime-fighting partners and sisters are from each other.\n\nChrysikou\u2019s role is to be the police expert of the team while Corcoran\u2019s character shows that common sense is also very valuable when solving crimes. Although accomplished in her own way, Rangi is certainly rough around the edges.\n\nThe challenge for Corcoran and co-writer Victoria Taylor Roberts was to make Rangi come across as someone who has lived a simple life but is not simple herself.\n\n\u201cWe would have this discussion. I\u2019d be like, \u2018Well, I think that might go too far because we would undermine her as a practical, sensible woman.\u2019 Interestingly, Shirley is based on women that I know, and I\u2019m close to in New Zealand,\u201d Corcoran says.\n\n\u201cShe is grounded in truth. A lot of Kiwi women have this can-do attitude. They\u2019re not frightened of anything. They don\u2019t feel intimidated. They\u2019re also very hands-on and very practical.\u201d\n\nWhen a question pops up as to how Rangi should act, Corcoran asks herself what her friend would do or her half-sister, her mother or her aunt.\n\nOne of the most difficult parts of the story was not how to introduce an unknown half-sister but how to keep her around. That meant coming up with scenarios such as Rangi never seeing a situation she didn\u2019t want to investigate and even having Moustakas get injured and needing a driver.\n\nKeeping the pair together was more difficult than creating the murders.\n\n\u201cIt was hard, so we had to be real about why detective Helen Moustakas would keep this crazy lady around her,\u201d Corcoran says. \u201cAnd so, we had to put the pathos of her having this intense pressure of being the only female detective in that particular police force and her constant worry about losing a job. So, she has to cover it up. We had to put in these things and the teenage daughter and all that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nPart of the stuff added to the mix is a list of well-known supporting players and guest stars. Marina Sirtis, who is best known for traveling the galaxy with \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation,\u201d plays the detective\u2019s mother.\n\nCorcoran is a massive \u201cStar Trek\u201d fan who calls the casting of Sirtis a gift. It wasn\u2019t just the Trekkie in her, but Sirtis speaks Greek and lives in London.\n\n\u201cThe Sunshine Murders\u201d has already been a hit in Europe. Now Corcoran is looking to build an audience in the United States through UPtv. She says her hope is that the series will open doors in Hollywood for her.\n\nThere is a trend when a show is a success in another country, producers will buy the rights to make an American version of the product. Corcoran is not certain what she would do with that situation.\n\nCorcoran laughs and says, \u201cOf course there\u2019s a difference between if you ask me now and if you ask me in 15 years\u2019 time when I\u2019ve done 800 episodes.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
