To alleviate this burden, families can implement strategies such as holding a weekly 'Sunday Sync' meeting to coordinate schedules, utilizing a centralized digital hub for important information, establishing routines to reduce decision fatigue, automating regular purchases, and sharing responsibilities among family members. These practices can help streamline household management and foster a more balanced family dynamic.",
