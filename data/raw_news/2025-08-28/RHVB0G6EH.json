      "text": "The state of Texas is intervening in California's attempts to implement stricter vehicle emissions standards than those set by the federal government.\nAfter Congress and Trump revoked three waivers the Biden administration granted California, which allowed the state to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than those at the federal level, Newsom immediately sued and issued an executive order directing state agencies to continue pushing the heightened standards. California's attempt to circumvent Congress could impact other states, since provisions of the federal Clean Air Act allow them to adopt California's tougher emissions regulations as opposed to the federal baseline.\nMeanwhile, a few weeks after Newsom's executive order, the Trump administration announced it would sue California in an effort to prevent them from trudging forward with the \"unlawful\" emissions standards. Now Texas is joining that fight with the help of pro-Trump legal group America First Legal (AFL).\nNEW RESEARCH REVEALS HOW EV, EMISSIONS MANDATES ARE INFLATING COSTS FOR GAS-POWERED CARS, UTILITIES\n\"California\u2019s crusade is not about innovation\u2014it is about abusing the legal system to flout federal law and impose its radical agenda on all Americans,\" said Daniel Epstein, vice president of America First Legal. \"America First Legal stands proudly with the State of Texas to defend competition, consumer choice, and the rule of law. We will not let Gavin Newsom remake America in California\u2019s image.\"\nTexas' motion to intervene, filed Friday with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Oakland Division, asks the court to allow Texas to become a party to the case so it can defend the interests of Texans, which state Attorney General Ken Paxton and AFL say would be impacted by California's attempt to impose strict electric vehicle mandates that can have an effect on the rest of the country.\n\"I am standing with President Trump in his effort to stop Gavin Newsom and California from shoving its insane so-called \u2018green energy\u2019 vehicle standards down the nation\u2019s throat,\" said Paxton. \"Texas will not look the other way while the failed state of California undermines our sovereignty, attacks America\u2019s energy independence, and intentionally adopts destructive policies that would harm the other States.\"\nCurrently, 17 other states and the District of Columbia have chosen to adopt at least part of California's vehicle emissions standards, according to a report released this month by the California Air Resources Board. The same report notes that, collectively, these states represent 40% of the nation's light-duty vehicle market, and 25% of its heavy-duty vehicle market.\nTRUMP V. CALIFORNIA: SANCTUARY CITIES TO EV BANS, TRUMP PUTS LEFT-WING STATE UNDER REPEATED SCRUTINY\nCalifornia's efforts to implement stricter car emissions regulations would effectively outlaw the sale of new gas- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035, AFL argued in a press release accompanying their Friday filing. Subsequently, AFL notes, the strict regulations would then impact car manufacturers because they would \"dictate the requirements for all cars sold throughout the United States\" since manufacturers typically do not produce different vehicle lineups for different states.\n\"That means fewer choices for families, skyrocketing costs, and an America remade in California\u2019s image,\" AFL stated in its press release.\nIn addition to the state of Texas, a major pro-business group, the American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce (AmFree), has also taken action to intervene in the case on the side of the Trump administration, with several agricultural and trade organizations backing the move.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It's clear this is not one of those issues that is like 'the Trump administration doing something completely novel' and 'courts having to wrestle with that,'\" said Michael Buschbacher, the lead attorney working with AmFree. \"This is like squarely, \u2018Congress passed the law. You can't undo that law unless it's unconstitutional and there's nothing unconstitutional here.'\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Gov. Newsom's office for comment, but did not receive a response in time for publication.\nFox News Digital's Charles Creitz contributed to this report."

      "text": "Gov. Gavin Newsom fired back Wednesday at a top California Republican who proposed a \"two-state solution\" in response to the Democrats' mid-decennial redistricting effort.\n\"A person who seeks to split California does not deserve to hold office in the Golden State. This is a stunt that will go nowhere,\" Newsom told Nexstar Broadcasting and FOX-40 reporter Eytan Wallace later Wednesday.\nNewsom was referring to California Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher, R-Yuba City, who announced a new bill to split California into two new states along a north-south line as a response to Newsom's redistricting effort.\nGallagher\u2019s plan, laid out in what will be filed as AJR-23, would create a new state featuring its liberal coast and another uniting California\u2019s conservative inland counties.\nDEMS WANTED TO DRAW EVERY REPUBLICAN OUT OF MARYLAND BUT NOW LAMBAST TEXAS REDISTRICTING\nGallagher dubbed the move a \"two-state solution\" \u2013 a term more identified with territorial clashes in the Middle East \u2013 to Newsom\u2019s own clash with Republicans, which is the governor's reply to Texas\u2019 redistricting efforts.\n\"The people of inland California have been overlooked for too long. It\u2019s time for a two-state solution,\" Gallagher said.\nResponding to Newsom after Wallace's report, Gallagher tweeted that he has been \"duly elected six times over and I assure you my actions represent exactly how my people feel.\"\n\"We will not allow you to strip us of representation,\" Gallagher said of Newsom.\nGallagher\u2019s resolution responds to Sacramento Democrats' attempt to permanently redraw California\u2019s congressional maps \u2013 an act he says would silence rural voices and rig the political system forever.\nWhile the political power of California\u2019s overall current landmass would be diminished, the new \"Inland\" California would be one of the largest states by population in the nation, and reliably right-leaning.\nFollowing a series of county lines generally slightly west of Interstate 5 \u2013 which runs the 800-mile height of the state \u2013 the new coastal state would retain many notably left-wing communities like San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Sonoma.\nIt would also include the relatively center-right Orange County, as well as San Diego County, where the state\u2019s Senate Republican Leader Brian Jones hails from.\nJones said earlier this month that Newsom wasn\u2019t elected \"to play gerrymandering games to boost his presidential campaign, [but] to solve problems here at home.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Jones and Newsom for comment.\nGallagher\u2019s home county \u2013 Sutter, located north of Sacramento \u2013 would fall in the new conservative inland state.\nIt would also include right-leaning Truckee \u2013 where Interstate 80 crosses the Sierras \u2013 along with Kern County, where former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., hails from.\nSan Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties \u2013 which today make up what is similarly called the \"Inland Empire\" \u2013 would also fall in the new state.\nThe 17 coastal counties would together create a state of 29.5 million people while the inland state would be home to 10 million, according to the Manteca Bulletin.\nMEXICAN IMMIGRANT-TURNED-CONGRESSWOMAN BLASTS DEM CLAIMS TEXAS REDISTRICTING HURTS LATINO VOTE\nTexas would become the nation\u2019s most populous state, edging out Coastal California by about 1.5 million, while Inland California would become the 11th most populous state \u2013 fitting in between Michigan and New Jersey.\nGallagher has lambasted what he calls Newsom\u2019s \"mid-decade power grab\" as a \"mockery of democracy.\"\n\"Don\u2019t p--- on my boots and tell me it\u2019s raining. These are rigged maps, drawn in secret to give Democrat politicians more power by dismantling the independent commission Californians created to keep them out of map-drawing,\" he said in a statement earlier this month. His comments came after Newsom approved the Democrats\u2019 plan to place a resolution on the November ballot allowing the state to circumvent its semi-independent redistricting board.\n\"Californians should choose their representatives, not the other way around,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSen. Megan Dahle, R-Bieber, who represents a large swath of rural northeastern California also welcomed the move on Wednesday:\n\"I don't have any illusion that this plan to split California will succeed where the many previous efforts have failed, but I signed on as a coauthor of this resolution to share the frustration of more conservative rural Californians that their voice goes unheard in Sacramento,\" Dahle told Fox News Digital.\n\"Last week's vote by the Democrats to carve up the North State's congressional districts to try to gerrymander our elected representatives out of office is just the latest blatant example.\"\nState Sen. Roger Niello, R-Fair Oaks, had thrown a procedural hurdle in the redistricting process last Monday by indicating in a letter to the Senate\u2019s secretary that he would withhold approval of unanimous consent requests for Tuesday\u2019s legislative session.\n\"The majority party drafted new congressional districts behind closed doors with D.C.-based political operatives to undermine the work of California\u2019s citizen-led commission in charge of redistricting,\" Niello said in a statement.\nIn a statement last week, state Senate GOP lawmakers said \"Democratic legislators have also been crystal clear about their support for independent redistricting as recently as July.\nBut in just a few weeks, a mysterious case of collective (and selective) amnesia seems to have set in. Let\u2019s rewind the tape and hear them in their own words.\"\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This story has been updated to reflect that California Senate Republicans issued a statement saying Democrats have a \"mysterious case of collective amnesia\" and that state Sen. Roger Niello said he would withhold approval of unanimous consent."

      "text": "Gavin Newsom is a Democratic politician and the 40th governor of California, entering office in January 2019. With over 20 years of political experience in the Golden State, Newsom previously served as the lieutenant governor of California from 2011 to 2019 and was elected the mayor of San Francisco in 2004. As the leader of the biggest and most populated state, Newsom is considered one of the country's most influential Democrats.\nNewsom is a native of San Francisco, the son of William Newsom, an appeal judge for California Courts. Before he entered elected office, Newsom worked in the private sector, starting a winery funding he raised from investors, including billionaire Gordon Getty. Newsom eventually sold his winery shares in 2004 after being elected mayor of San Francisco.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Newsom faced widespread criticism after he was pictured breaking his own health guidelines while dining inside a luxurious restaurant in Napa Valley. The image showed Newsom dining maskless with a large group of close friends and political allies, including California lobbyists, while celebrating his birthday. The scandal helped grow support around the effort to recall the governor, gaining more than 2 million signatures to trigger a recall election.\nHowever, Newsom went on to defeat the recall attempt by over 3 million votes, defeating conservative talk show host Larry Elder, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, and a dozen other candidates. He will face another election in November 2022, but has already won the state's Democratic nomination with 61% of the vote.\nUnder Newsom's administration, California has seen a large exodus of its urban and rural population to other states such as Texas and Florida. Many experts have blamed the depopulation partly due to the state's high living costs for gas and rent and Newsom's tax policy \u2014 the highest in the nation."

      "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a set of bills to allow voters to decide whether to overturn the preexisting congressional maps and the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission, ushering in a new one with a more partisan bent.\nThe bills, sent to Newsom earlier on Thursday by the Democrat-dominated California legislature, are part of an effort in the blue state to nullify Texas\u2019 new congressional map with one of their own.\nThe redistricting bills were passed by the California legislature along party-line votes in the state Assembly and Senate. The bills allow California voters to decide in a special election on Nov. 4 whether to allow the state to suspend its bipartisan redistricting commission and replace the current districts with a map drawn up by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nThe bill was quickly signed by Newsom on Thursday. In a post celebrating the legislature passing the bills, Newsom said, \"It's official. California's special election is ON for November 4th.\"\nABBOTT SCORES BIG WIN IN REDISTRICTING BATTLE AS TEXAS DEMOCRATS' BLOCKADE COLLAPSES\n\"The People of California will be able to cast their vote for a Congressional map. Direct democracy that gives us a fighting chance to STOP Donald Trump's election rigging,\" wrote Newsom, adding, \"Time to fight fire with fire.\"\nSpeaking in a press conference on Thursday, Newsom accused Trump of being \"one of the most unpopular presidents in U.S. history\" and claimed \"he recognizes he will lose the election, Congress will go back in the hands of the Democratic Party next November.\"\nNewsom\u2019s push for a special session and new map was a call and response to President Donald Trump, Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas Republicans, who crafted their own fresh map that passed the Texas House on Wednesday that gives the GOP five new, Republican-leaning districts.\nThe new maps are slated to turn five Republican districts into Democratic-leaning districts, as part of an effort to cancel out the changes made in Texas. Both states are engaging in a broader battle to gain control of the House pushed by Trump, who wants to buck the pendulum swing trend during off-cycle elections and maintain control of the lower chamber.\n\"This is about taking back our country,\" Newsom told reporters on a press call Wednesday. \"This is about the Democratic Party now punching back forcefully and very intentionally.\"\nThursday's legislative session comes on the heels of the California GOP's attempt to halt the process by charging that they did not have their constitutionally granted 30 days to review the legislation, which was shot down by the California Supreme Court on Wednesday.\nAhead of the opening of the legislature, California Republicans gathered outside of the state house to slam Democrats' move to change the maps.\n\"The governor says they're fighting fire with fire,\" Republican Leader James Gallagher said. \"Well, the problem when you fight fire with fire is you burn it all down. And that's what we've got going on right now.\"\nHERE ARE THE 5 GOP HOUSE SEATS THAT COULD BE WIPED OUT WITH NEWSOM'S CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PLAN\nDuring Thursday\u2019s session, California lawmakers considered three bills, one to pay for the special session, one containing the new map and another teeing up a constitutional amendment to be considered by voters in November.\nPrior to passage on the House floor, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, D-Calif., accused Trump of not believing in democracy, being \"terrified of losing, and he will do whatever it takes to cling on to power.\"\n\"We will not let our political system be hijacked by authoritarianism, and today, we give every Californian the power to say \u2018no,\u2019 to say \u2018no\u2019 to Donald Trump's power grab and \u2018yes\u2019 to our people, to our state and to our democracy,\" he said.\nThe map would likely affect five California Republicans\u2019 districts represented by Reps. Doug LaMalfa, David Valadao, Darrell Issa, Ken Calvert and Kevin Kiley. Earlier this month, Kiley introduced legislation to halt the nationwide redistricting push until after the 2030 census.\nLike the Texas map, it\u2019s not guaranteed that Democrats will win the seats, but Newsom and his supermajority in the state legislature are angling to give them a better shot.\nTRUMP, ABBOTT VS. NEWSOM: MAD DASH TO REDO CONGRESSIONAL MAPS IN CALIFORNIA, TEXAS\nBut Trump\u2019s desire to maintain the GOP\u2019s trifecta in Washington has spurred other states to consider a redistricting effort, too.\n\"Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself,\" he said on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing.\"\nWhile Trump and his allies continue to prod for more changes to state maps, Newsom has found an ally in his own push: former President Barack Obama.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHe argued that Newsom was taking a \"responsible approach,\" but noted that mid-decade redistricting, particularly of the hyperpartisan nature that Newsom and Republicans were engaged in, was not his preference.\n\"I\u2019ve had to wrestle with my preference, which would be that we don\u2019t have political gerrymandering,\" Obama said on Tuesday at an event in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. \"But what I also know is that if we don\u2019t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop.\""
