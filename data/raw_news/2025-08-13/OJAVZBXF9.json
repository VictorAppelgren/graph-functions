  "description": "These new and refurbished models offer a great way to put a modern Mac on your desk for less.",
  "content": "It's that time of year again, and families are looking to kit their kids out with a computer for the school year. Fans of Apple gear will already have their parents sweating at the thought of Mac prices, but there's light at the end of the tunnel. While the latest M4 Macs are super-fast, they're definitely overkill for schoolwork.\n\nIn fact, any M-series Mac will get the job done and Woot is running a sale with tons of new and refurbished units available from just $360.\n\nThe older M1 iMac and M2 Mac Mini machines are still more than capable for most folks, and there are some iMacs included in this sale as well. That makes this latest Woot sale well worth checking out, but be sure to do it soon -- this sale ends in a few days and some Macs are already starting to sell out.\n\nThere are also Intel-based iMacs on offer but we suggest skipping those and going straight for the M1 models thanks to the much-improved chip and modern design. All of these iMacs are reconditioned, the cheapest of which is an M1 model with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for $680. You can upgrade to one with an extra GPU core and more storage if you prefer with 512GB and 1TB storage on offer for just $800. That's still a lot cheaper than the newer M4 model that start at almost $1,300.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nOn the Mac Mini side, an M2 model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD can be yours for $360. Remember that some of these units are refurbished while others are brand new, so keep an eye on the warranty situation for the model you want before ordering.\n\nThis Woot sale does also include some Intel-powered iMacs and Mac minis, but we suggest giving them a miss at this point. They're getting a little long in the tooth and we definitely suggest choosing an M1 machine or newer at this point.\n\nPrefer your computers to come with full Apple warranties and that new computer smell? Our list of the best iMac deals around should get you a brand-new model at a price to match your budget.\n\nAll of Apple's M-series Macs are a solid buy if you can find one at the right price, something that couldn't have been said about the older models based on Intel chips. Even the original M1 chips are fast enough for the majority of people, and they can even play plenty of games as well.\n\nIf you want that famous Apple to design and to be able to run macOS apps while spending as little as possible, this could well be the sale for you.",

A New York native and former radio DJ, he's also a regular TV talking head and the author of \"The Tetris Effect\" (Hachette/PublicAffairs), a non-fiction gaming and business history book that has earned rave reviews from the New York Times, Fortune, LA Review of Books, and many other publications.\n\"Upends the standard Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs/Mark Zuckerberg technology-creation myth... the story shines.\" -- The New York Times\nExpertiseI've been testing and reviewing computer and gaming hardware for over 20 years, covering every console launch since the Dreamcast and every MacBook...ever.Credentials\nAuthor of the award-winning, NY Times-reviewed nonfiction book The Tetris Effect; Longtime consumer technology expert for CBS Mornings\nUnboxing the new 24-inch Apple iMac, all I could think was that my old curved-back 27-inch iMac was a dead man walking. The long-standing iMac design, virtually untouched since 2012, held up well over the years, but a change was well past due. The new version of the smaller iMac model (formerly 21.5 inches, now 24 inches) has a slim, refreshed design, and is available in a wide variety of colors. It feels especially fresh as this is the first Mac with a ground-up new design to go with its new M1 CPU/GPU platform. The new models go on sale on May 21.\nSome features are reserved for more expensive configurations\nLimited RAM and storage options\nNo ability to mix-and-match accessory colors.\nThe question was, which Mac would make the jump to M1 next? It turned out to be the smaller of two iMac models, along with one of Apple's new iPad Pro tablets. Formerly an all-in-one desktop with a 21.5-inch screen, this is now the 24-inch model, fitting a larger display into a similar footprint, thanks to thinner screen bezels and other design tweaks.\nThe iMac aesthetic for almost 10 years has been a large display, gently bowed out on the back, tapering to a sharp edge and perched on a single curved foot. Now we have a flat body, similar to a computer monitor, with squared-off edges. Contrasting colors highlight a slimmer screen bezel, instead of masking it in black. It's more colorful, but at the same time less organic.\nThe power cable has been redesigned and now attaches magnetically. It's in a similar spot as on the previous iMac design, allowing the cable to fit through a hole in the stand for tidy routing. The magnetic connection is a clever concept, but don't mistake it for Apple's old MagSafe laptop cables. The connection is tight enough that I don't think it would harmlessly pop out if you tripped over it, although I have yet to put that to the test.\nThe iMac's built-in Ethernet port has also been banished to the power brick, something I've only seen a handful of times over the years. Just be sure to note that on the base $1,299 (\u00a31,249, AU$1,899) iMac, you have to add an extra $30 to get that Ethernet port version of the power brick.\nThe trapezoidal foot has been constrained to a neat rectangle. The screen hinge has moved further down, to a less awkward spot than before. The older iMac design hinged its screen in the center of the body, which was required by its hefty weight to keep everything nice and stable.\nThis is Apple's first computer designed from the ground up to be an M1 system, and it portends a major shift in Mac design that may make its way to the MacBook, Mac Mini and other systems.\nLaptops and desktops have gotten thinner over time, squeezing more power into an ever-smaller footprint. But more important than that is weight, and I've always felt that PC makers should focus on dropping weight over shaving off a few fractions of a millimeter. After lugging the 27-inch Core i7 iMac around my apartment regularly during the past Covid year, mostly in order to make use of its excellent camera for video meetings, the 9-pound, 24-inch iMac felt incredibly light. That current 27-inch iMac weighs 20 pounds, while the 21.5-inch iMac this model replaces was around 12 pounds.\niPhones have come in a variety of colors for years. MacBooks have had a few color options, but they were understated, with gray, silver and gold options that really didn't look all that different from each other. With seven bold colors (and each a two-tone combination), the new iMac is the most colorful Mac computer in a long time.\nThe choice of colors is a clear throwback to the classic iMac G3 from 1999, which dressed up its bulky CRT display with candy- colored outer shells. Long a fan favorite, it's great to see this aesthetic return, and work-from-home types might certainly welcome a dash of color to dress up their spaces.\nI tested the orange model, which has a creamsicle-like vibe. With all the iMac colors, there's a more muted shade on the front panel and a deeper shade on the back. That color choice extends across the entire product. The power cable and included lightning cable are color-coordinated, as are the keyboard and mouse or touchpad and even the desktop background image. The outer box also matches, with images of your choice of color on the package, and even a color-matched carrying handle.\nThe biggest shocker for a lot of people may be the absence of the Apple logo from the front panel, where it's always lived right below the display. It's now a blank expanse, and only emphasizes just how much dead space there still is under the display.\nThe second-biggest shocker may be that the color-coordinated keyboard, mouse and touchpad is only available with the system you ordered, and only in the same color. No, you can't match a green iMac with a purple keyboard. Nor can you buy a colored keyboard separately and use it with another system. Note that the $1,299 base model keyboard lacks Touch ID, so you'll have to splurge on it as a $50 add-on during the system configuration, as it's your only opportunity to upgrade. And you definitely should, as Touch ID on a Mac is too useful to skip.\nApple is saying a firm \"no\" for now, but I suspect the colored Touch ID keyboards will eventually be available separately. The dark gray keyboard and other accessories for the late iMac Pro were originally only available with the purchase of a system, but later they were available a la carte.\nThe case for a kitchen-ready computer\nI'm fascinated by the idea of a kitchen computer, and one of the use scenarios painted by Apple is using the new iMac as a cooking companion. That could mean pulling recipe websites up on the 24-inch screen while you're cooking, or moving your video chatting, music streaming or other activities into the kitchen.\nThe new iMac arrived just before a family trip, so it ended up in this open-air cabin kitchen for a little while. In my own modestly sized Brooklyn apartment kitchen, I doubt the iMac would have fit comfortably between the Balmuda toaster, Nespresso machine, Instant Pot and other gadgets fighting for limited counter space. For a short time I tried setting up a Microsoft Surface tablet as a kitchen countertop computer, but even that took up too much space.\nI could see the appeal, especially as an alternative to propping a laptop up to follow along with a recipe. But would I really do that enough to justify keeping an iMac in the kitchen full time? Probably not, but I'd be tempted to lug it in for an online cooking class. Something similar with a touchscreen makes a better case, as the keyboard and touchpad are not especially conducive to kitchen use. Every time there's a new Mac, some people say, \"It would be great if this had a touchscreen,\" and in this case, it's true.\nPerformance, as expected\nIn a lot of ways, the current MacBook Air, Mac Mini, 13-inch MacBook Pro and 24-inch iMac are all the same computer. They all use the new M1 processor, the same OS and have similar RAM and storage configurations. The differences that could affect performance come in part from the two different M1 versions. Both have eight CPU cores, but one has eight GPU cores while the other has only seven GPU cores. If you're trying to figure out which one you have, the entry-level models generally have the seven core GPU version.\nThe other factor that can affect performance is cooling. The fanless MacBook Air can't run as hard as the MacBook Pro, which has internal fans for cooling. Similarly, the base model 24-inch iMac has a single internal fan, while the step-up models have two fans, which can help with sustained performance.\nAs expected, there's not a lot of sunlight between these M1 systems. We tested the M1 versions of the MacBook Air, Mac Mini and 13-inch MacBook Pro in late 2020, and those are the same M1 versions you'd get today. The 24-inch iMac we tested had the 8 GPU core version of the M1, along with 16GB or RAM and a 512GB SSD, for a total of $1,899. It will also be interesting to see how the new M1-powered iPad Pro compares in the handful of cross-platform benchmarks available.\nIn real-world use terms, that means you can easily work with 4K video footage in apps like DaVinci Resolve or Premiere, even previewing in 4K while you go, although there are other reasons a full-time video editor might not choose a 24-inch iMac. Like Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve, Photoshop now has an M1-native version. Other apps not yet updated for the new platform will have to run through Rosetta, Apple's x86 emulator, which you'll generally never even notice.\nM1 Macs compared\nGeekbench 5 single-core\nGeekbench 5 multicore\nCinebench R23 multicore\n3DMark Wild Life Extreme (Unlimited)\n24-inch iMac (M1)\n1,726\n7,572\n7,748\n4,916\nMac Mini (M1)\n1,743\n7,704\n7,796\n4,966\nMacBook Air (M1)\n1,731\n7,518\n6,822\n4,443\n13-inch MacBook Pro (M1)\n1,723\n7,457\n7,772\n4,947\niPad Pro (M1)\n1,706\n7,318\nn/a\n4,519\nMacBook Air (2020, Core i5)\n1,184\n4,143\n4,703\nn/a\niPad Pro 11-inch (2020, A12Z)\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n3,261\nGaming has never been a strength for Macs, and when the M1 Macs launched, many Mac-compatible games didn't run well (or at all) and even the popular Steam gaming storefront stuttered while running under Rosetta. Steam itself runs normally now, and I was able to play some decently demanding games, like Baldur's Gate 3.\nThat said, I think my Mac gaming solution going forward is going to be cloud platforms like Stadia or GeForce Now. All the players in that space have their own issues, but it's a great way to get current games like Resident Evil Village up on that impressive iMac screen.\nAnother gaming solution is to try games from the Apple Arcade subscription service. It's mostly focused on iPad and iPhone gaming, but a handful of games like Fantasian really come to life on the larger iMac.\nIf there's one universal truth everyone has had to face during the past 15 months... it's that most people have terrible webcams. Almost any laptop you use for a Zoom meeting (yes, this includes all the current MacBooks) will have a low-res, 720p-at-best camera, usually with weak software and signal processing. Since many standalone webcams were sold out and hard to get in 2020 and beyond, you were stuck with whatever was in your laptop.\nAt least the 2020 27-inch iMac, still with an Intel processor, jumped up to a standard full-HD 1080p webcam (as previously seen on the iMac Pro). When I tested it last year, the difference was astonishing. I literally lugged that thing from one end of my house to the other several times just to use the better camera for meetings.\nI'd much rather be lugging this 9-pound version round instead, as it now also has a 1080p camera. Apple says the hardware is not the same as that 27-inch iMac version, and that the M1 platform allows for better image processing software. On paper, that sounds like it should be a better camera, although it looked pretty evenly matched with the 27-inch iMac version. That said, changing lighting conditions could occasionally freak out the 27-inch iMac camera exposure settings, while the new 24-inch iMac camera took similar challenging lighting situations in a stride.\nWho should buy one, and who should wait\nPlaying with the new 24-inch iMac has only made me more eager to see a 27-inch version in the same design. The same goes for new color options for MacBooks or even the Mac Mini. Apple's two-year march towards CPU independence seems to be moving along at a rapid pace, hopefully the new designs will follow along.\nIf you have a 21.5-inch iMac that's several years old and are looking to update, then I'll say the same thing here as I did about the MacBook Air: The transition to M1 is going to be largely invisible to you, which is exactly what you should want. I've run into a small handful of compatibility issues since last year, but for the most part, things work the same or better.\nA pro-level user may want more than the top-end 16GB of RAM, or more than a max 2TB of storage. In that case, a future updated 27-inch iMac or updated 16-inch Pro may be worth waiting for. Maybe we'll see those later this year, or maybe next year.\nIf you've never had an iMac before and are considering switching from a laptop to an all-in-one desktop, I can see the appeal for an ongoing work-from-home situation. You get a lot more screen space in a tiny footprint. At $1,299 to start, it's a hefty premium over the MacBook Air for essentially the same machine, just with a larger screen and a stand (and without a battery). Still, if you're considering it, I recommend starting with the $1,499 (\u00a31,449, AU$2,199) model, which adds the Touch ID version of the keyboard, two extra USB-C ports, the eight-core GPU and better cooling as well as an Ethernet port built into the power supply. Just be sure to choose a color that best reflects your celebratory, (almost) post-pandemic feels, and get a head start on your hot Mac summer."

      "text": "Pros\n- Low starting price\n- Wide range of configuration options\n- Adds Wi-Fi 6E\nCons\n- Least expensive model has fewer ports, small storage\n- RAM can only go up to 32GB\n- Some component upgrades feel pricey\nEditor's note: Our Mac Mini review was originally published on January 23, 2023. It's since been updated with new test results, including storage speed scores.\nNow available in a new, more powerful version, the Mac Mini desktop is one of Apple's longest-standing product lines, dating back to 2005 (in a pre-Intel version), a year before the first MacBook. All these years later, it retains the same basic shape and appeals to much of the same audience. Unlike MacBook Pro and Air laptops, or the iMac desktop, the Mini is designed to work behind the scenes, fitting into small spaces and pairing with your choice of display and input devices.\nSometimes called the podcaster's favorite computer, that description still applies to this new iteration of the Mac Mini. And, with an optional M2 Pro processor from Apple's chip line, the new Mini can take on more complex multimedia assignments on par with the also-new M2 Pro MacBook Pro.\nRead more: M2 Pro MacBook Pro 16 Review: Apple Peps Up Its Creative Workhorse\nAt $599 (\u00a3649, AU$999) to start, the Mini also remains the least expensive way to get a MacOS computer by a large margin. The relatively ancient M1 MacBook Air from 2020 is the closest competitor price-wise, at $999. The M2 Pro version of the Mac Mini starts at $1,299.\nSystem configurations\n| Apple Mac Mini (M2, 2023) | Apple Mac Mini (M2 Pro, 2023) | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Price as reviewed | $599 | $1,799 |\n| CPU | Apple M2 (8-core CPU,10-core GPU) | Apple M2 Pro (12-core CPU,19-core GPU) |\n| RAM | 8GB LPDDR5 | 16GB LPDDR5 |\n| Storage | 256GB SSD | 1TB SSD |\n| Networking | Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3 | Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3 |\n| Operating system | MacOS Ventura 13.2 | MacOS Ventura 13.2 |\nAs a long-time Mac reviewer, the relative affordability of the Mini line is still one of its most important selling points. Especially if you have your own display and maybe your own keyboard/mouse setup, the Mac Mini gets you all the advantages of MacOS, and its speciality chops in design, audio production, and photo and video editing, for a lot less.\nThe last time I tested a new Mac Mini was the last time there was a new Mac Mini. That was in fall 2020, when the very first Apple Silicon products were released. They included the MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini, each with the original M1 chip.\nSince then, the Mac Studio from early 2022 offered a bigger, more powerful take on the small-form-factor Apple desktop, with M1 Max and M1 Ultra chips. And that system, even without an M2 update, is still more powerful in many cases than the new Mac Mini, which only goes up to an M2 Pro.\nApple's chip-naming system is clearer than some others but still confusing if you don't follow it closely. The M1 family has grown to include the M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max and M1 Ultra (basically a doubled-up M1 Max). The M2 family started with the stock M2 and has just added M2 Pro and M2 Max versions. It's the Pro/Max/Ultra suffix that really tells you which chip is more powerful. An M1 Pro is still more powerful than a base M2 and so on. But\u2026 the number of CPU and GPU cores available in some configurations can also juggle the rankings and relative performance.\nThat means the Apple desktop ecosystem is very thinly sliced indeed. Right now, the Mac Mini offers M2 and M2 Pro versions, the Mac Studio has M1 Max and M1 Ultra chips, so I wouldn't say there's direct overlap. The higher-end M2 Pro Mac Mini starts at $1,299, while the least expensive Mac Studio, with the M1 Max, starts at $1,999.\nA tale of two Minis\nThe two new Mac Mini versions differ in both the chip and some configuration options. The M2 model starts with 8GB of RAM, which can be upgraded to 16GB or 24GB. Storage starts at 256GB and can go up to 2TB. The M2 Pro version starts at 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage and is upgradable to 32GB and 8TB.\nAnother difference is that the M2 Pro model has four thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports on the back panel, while the M2 version has only two. And while the M2 Pro can support up to three displays, or one with 8K/60Hz resolution, the M2 model can support two displays and tops out at 6K/60Hz.\nThe two models tested here are the base $599 Mac Mini with the 8-core CPU/10-core GPU M2 chip, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; and an upgraded version with the 12-core CPU/19-core GPU M2 chip, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, for a total of $1,799.\nA podcaster's dream\nWhere other Apple products have had their moment in the sun and faded into extinction, like the 27-inch iMac or 12-inch MacBook, the Mac Mini has always floated just under the radar. It's not the first Mac you think of, but it's always there. I attribute that to its second life, perhaps originally unintended, as the perfect computer for small production studios.\nThat could mean a small to midsize recording studio for music and voice-overs, or a home office setup for audio or video podcasts. That's an area where dedicated computers are in danger of becoming obsolete, as popular new platforms like TikTok are built around shooting and editing directly from your phone.\nBut as an occasional social media poster, and podcast guest and host, over the years, there's still no comparison between even advanced phone-based editing and using something like Final Cut or Premiere Pro on a desktop or laptop to produce your creator content, even if it'll eventually end up as a small vertical social video.\nAnd especially for audio, the Mac Mini still feels like an excellent all-around solution. I recorded some video voice-over on the Mac Mini for this review, using Audacity and an external mic. As expected, I had no problems, even running multiple sound-shaping plugins (although for a very basic task like this, a standard budget Windows machine could do the same).\nI asked one of my team's video editors to throw a decently chunky Premiere Pro project on both the M2 and M2 Pro versions of the Mac Mini.\nVideo producer-editor Bobby Oliver loaded up a 4K/24 Premiere project with some graphics/titles and color correction. He said on the base $599 Mac Mini with the M2 chip, \"It was doable, but while editing I had to play the video in the program window at the lowest quality setting to avoid stuttering, but even then I got some minor stuttering.\" He said the system would be fine for regular FHD video, but he thought the 8GB of RAM in the base model was a performance obstacle. The base-model Mac Mini with the 256GB SSD also has slower read/write speeds than other configs, similar to the M2 MacBook Air, because of how the storage is either split into two NAND chips, or uses just one. The results of a basic SSD speed test are below.\nSSD Speed\n| Black Magic (Disk drive read and write test in MB/s) | Read | Write |\n|---|---|---|\n| Apple Mac Mini (M2 Pro, 2023) | 6137.5 | 5039.2 |\n| Apple Mac Mini (M2, 2023) | 1659.7 | 1579.1 |\nThen he tried the same project on the M2 Pro version, which had 16GB of RAM. In that case, he said, \"That one felt almost flawless. I could preview the video at full resolution and only had some minor stuttering when I hit the graphics. I could move easily around the timeline without any delay. Color correction didn't seem to be an issue. I would definitely use it as an editing machine.\"\nIn our benchmark tests, the different levels of M1 and M2 chip performance are also clear, in part because the CPU and GPU core counts and clock frequencies have risen generation-over-generation. Generally, the Mac Studio desktop with the M1 Max chip from 2022 is the overall most powerful Mac we've tested \u2013 in situations where it has the most cores. The Mini and Air with M2 chips outperformed their predecessors with M1 chips, and similarly, the M2 Pro systems beat the M1 Pro systems. Apple's well-marked strata of chip versions generally tells you what to expect once you figure out the language, but it can still be tricky.\nOverall, I appreciate how you can get similar performance in either a desktop or laptop by choosing the same chip/RAM combo, making for easier comparison shopping; but note that the desktops and larger laptops have some inherent thermal advantage with better cooling that can add a small performance boost.\nIs the Mac finally a gaming machine?\nWell, no. Although in its promotional materials, Apple leans a little more heavily into promoting the gaming chops of the M2 chips. The company calls out performance for the upcoming Mac version of Resident Evil Village, saying the M2 Mac Mini has 35% faster performance in that game over the 2020 M1 version, and that the M2 Pro version is 2.8x faster.\nBut your game experience is going to be greatly impacted by many factors, including choice of display, either the Apple Studio display, Apple's favored LG displays or something else; and by the still-limited game selection on MacOS, largely constrained by the desktop-friendly games in Apple Arcade, games in the Mac App Store and the MacOS section in online game stores like Steam.\nRight now, the top-selling MacOS games on Steam include Civilization VI (2016), Rust (2018), Project Zomboid (2013) and, of course, Baldur's Gate 3 (2020 in beta, but officially releasing summer 2023).\nWhile there's nothing especially new on the gaming front for this hardware or the new M2 chips (besides faster performance), I decided to give it another shot as a game machine. Pre-Apple-Silicon, you could at least dual-boot into Windows to play PC games on Mac hardware. Now, you're mostly limited to native Mac games or cloud streaming \u2013 Nvidia Geforce Now is great paired with a big 24-inch iMac display, for example.\nConnecting a standard Xbox controller via Bluetooth (a Sony DualSense controller will work, too), I spent some time with Baldur's Gate 3 and Hades. The high screen resolution of the Mac Studio Display I used added some extra challenge, and I turned up the in-game graphic settings as high as possible. Mac versions of games often have fewer graphics options than the Windows versions.\nOn the M2 Mac Mini, Baldur's Gate 3 needed to get its resolution pulled down to 2,560x1,440 pixels and graphics settings set to medium to feel playable. On the M2 Pro version, I used the same resolution but could play at Ultra settings. Hades ran great on even the base Mac Mini. In both the GPU-intensive 3D Mark and the GeekBench Metal test, we can see some additional daylight between the M2 and M2 Pro, as indicated in the charts below.\nWho should buy this?\nA MacBook Air is easy to visualize in action \u2013 stick it in your backpack or shoulder bag and hit the coffee shop or airport. An iMac is a great centralized family room computer or a home office command center, especially if you spend a lot of time in Zoom or other video meetings. The Mac Mini is more specialized in some ways, but also has potentially broader appeal because of its low starting price.\nThe base M2 version of the Mac Mini, starting at $599, feels like it's for entry-level buyers who want a MacOS system at the lowest possible price; audio and video producers who are already committed to a collection of external displays, input devices and storage drives; or anyone who needs a portable mini desktop that can be thrown in a bag and hooked up at an office or recording studio. Also worth noting, the Mac Mini has an Ethernet port, HDMI output and USB-A ports, which are great for expansion and hard to find in some other Macs, even very expensive ones.\nThe main downside to that base model is the relative skimpy RAM and storage. Unlike a Windows machine, MacOS can actually get along fine in most mainstream cases with 8GB of RAM, but the included 256GB of storage feels like it'll get filled quickly. Jumping up to 512GB adds an extra $200, which is a big premium for a budget computer (but also offers potentially faster read/write speeds).\nThe M2 Pro version offers a sizable raw performance jump, plus better RAM and internal storage options, but if you're considering that, then the MacBook Pro and even the Mac Studio should also be part of your comparison shopping.\nI think the base M2 Mac Mini is going to be a smart, clear choice for a lot of people. The more powerful, more expensive M2 Pro version isn't as clear cut, but I appreciate the flexibility having both the M2 and M2 Pro versions adds, allowing you to spend anywhere from $599 to $4,499 on a new Mac Mini that meets your specific needs, whether that's creating pro-level YouTube videos or recording and producing the next great true crime podcast.\nSystem configurations\n| Apple Mac Mini (M1, 2020) | MacOS Monterey 12.5.1; Apple M1 (8 CPU cores, 16 GPU Cores); 8GB PDDR4X RAM; 256GB SSD |\n|---|---|\n| Apple Mac Mini (M2, 2023) | MacOS Ventura 13.2; Apple M2 (8 CPU cores, 10 GPU cores); 8GB LPDDR5 RAM; 256GB SSD |\n| Apple Mac Mini (M2 Pro, 2023) | MacOS Ventura 13.2; Apple M2 Pro (12-core CPU,19-core GPU); 16GB LPDDR5 RAM; 1TB SSD |\n| Apple Mac Studio (M1 Max, 2022) | MacOS Monterey 12.3; Apple M1 Max (10 CPU ores, 32 GPU cores); 64GB RAM; 2TB SSD |\n| Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M1, 2022) | MacOS Monterey 12.4; Apple M2 (8 CPU cores, 10 cores GPU); 8GB LPDDR5 RAM; 256GB SSD |\n| Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M1 Pro, 2021) | MacOS Monterey 12.4; Apple M1 Pro (10 CPU cores, 16 GPU cores); 32GB LPDDR5 RAM; 1TB SSD |\n| Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M1 Max 2021) | MacOS Monterey 12.4; Apple M1 Max (12 CPU cores, 32 GPU cores); 32GB RAM; 512GB SSD |\n| Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M2 Pro 2023) | MacOS Ventura 13.2; Apple M2 Pro (12 CPU cores, 19 GPU cores); 32GB LPDDR5 RAM; 1TB SSD |"
