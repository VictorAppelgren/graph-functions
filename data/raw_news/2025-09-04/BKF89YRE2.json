  "description": "Dominance in cloud computing and artificial intelligence is propelling these two tech leaders.",
  "content": "Dominance in cloud computing and artificial intelligence is propelling these two tech leaders.\n\nLet's get one thing out of the way: Apple (AAPL 3.62%) is an excellent company. It boasts one of the most valuable brand names in the world, an army of loyal customers, and has consistently proven its innovative qualities over time. However, the tech leader has faced challenges lately, one of which is the threat of tariffs. Furthermore, Apple has fallen behind some of its similarly sized tech peers in the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nThe tailwind AI is providing to two of them, Amazon (AMZN 0.17%) and Alphabet (GOOG 8.93%) (GOOGL 9.00%), could enable both to surpass Apple in terms of market capitalization within the next three years. Here's why Amazon and Alphabet look like better buys right now.\n\nAmazon's current market cap is $2.4 billion, compared to Apple's $3.4 trillion. That sounds like a massive difference, but it's worth noting that Amazon has consistently grown its revenue faster than its peers over the past three years, despite having higher sales numbers.\n\nThe e-commerce specialist should maintain that momentum for several reasons. First, it remains a leader in the cloud computing market. Even as it loses ground to some of its closest competitors, Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), remains a strong performer. The company's AWS sales in the second quarter increased by 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion, outpacing the rest of the business. AWS is also responsible for most of Amazon's profits.\n\nSecond, Amazon is capitalizing on the rise of AI, thanks to a suite of AI-related services it offers through its cloud. The company is also implementing the technology in-house. For instance, Amazon's industrial robots utilize AI-powered algorithms to optimize travel distances in the company's warehouses, enabling them to handle and deliver packages more efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\nThird, Amazon's advertising business should represent yet another important growth driver. As of the end of 2024, the company's advertising revenue run rate was $69 billion, more than doubling since 2020. Amazon is one of the most visited websites in the world, making it an attractive hub for advertisers. These three growth drivers -- the cloud, AI, and advertising-- should maintain solid momentum in the next three years, and well beyond that, for that matter.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy believes we are still in the early innings of the cloud and AI revolutions. Amazon's most important business, cloud computing, is less exposed than Apple to tariff-related concerns. True, if President Donald Trump's policies lead to an economic downturn, spending will decrease for consumers and businesses, resulting in lower revenue for the company's e-commerce and cloud units. Even so, this potential challenge would also impact Apple. Additionally, the latter may have to contend with heavy tariffs on imported goods from abroad, which would disrupt its primary source of revenue and profits.\n\nLastly, Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 34.6 may be higher than Apple's 29.2, but the former's premium is well-deserved. Amazon is well-positioned to outpace Apple in the next few years and become a more valuable company by market cap. It should deliver excellent results well beyond that.\n\nAlphabet's market cap is $2.5 trillion. It has also grown its revenue faster than Apple much more often than not in the past three years, and has not surpassed the iPhone maker in quarterly sales.\n\nAlphabet's advertising business remains its biggest source of sales, thanks to the company's dominance in search. Even AI chatbots haven't made a significant impact on Alphabet's search empire, especially as the company has adapted to this new landscape. Alphabet has added the now highly successful AI overviews to its search engine. Elsewhere, the company's cloud and AI businesses are helping supercharge top-line growth. In the second quarter, Alphabet's cloud division grew by almost 32% year over year, much faster than even AWS.\n\nThe parent company of Google recently signed a $10 billion, six-year cloud deal with Meta Platforms. In other words, business is booming for Google Cloud. The rest of Alphabet's business, including YouTube, a leader in the streaming industry, is also performing well.\n\nYet, the stock's forward P/E is 22, much lower than Amazon's and Apple's. The market remains concerned that Alphabet may be forced to sell its Chrome browser as part of an antitrust lawsuit, which could significantly disrupt its advertising business. If that happens, Alphabet's shares will plunge. It's worth keeping that risk in mind, while also remembering that forcing companies to divest part of their operations in high-profile antitrust cases is a very rare outcome for the U.S. government. If Alphabet can overcome this obstacle, though, the stock will soar and, over the next three years, could perform well enough to overtake the battered Apple.",

      "text": "New streaming TV options have launched at a frenzied pace over the last few years. With many subscription internet TV services to choose from, streaming entertainment has become ubiquitous in U.S. homes.\nConsumers spend increasingly large amounts of time on streaming media, so TV providers are responding by rapidly migrating their advertising activity over to those streaming platforms.\nThe streaming phenomenon\nThe streaming phenomenon\nWe stream a lot of content. The average person spends 4.3 hours streaming video content each day.\nOur streaming habits are generating a growing stream of revenue for content companies from subscriptions and advertising. The over-the-top streaming market is on track to grow from $172 billion in 2023 to $198.1 billion in 2024.\nThat growing revenue stream is making streaming stocks look like compelling long-term investments. Here's a look at the best streaming TV service stocks to invest in.\nState of Streaming\nThe Motley Fool surveyed 2,000 Americans about their streaming habits and preferences to find out what the future might hold for streaming services.\nBest streaming service stocks\nBest streaming service stocks in 2025\nThere are many ways to gain portfolio exposure to streaming services. Here, we focus on the companies that are either pure plays or earn outsized returns on streaming.\nThe best streaming entertainment stocks include industry pioneer Netflix (NFLX 0.86%), entertainment giant Disney (DIS -0.85%), and streaming platform leader Roku (ROKU 2.72%).\nCash Flow\n1. Netflix\nAs the company that started the streaming TV party, Netflix remains the largest streaming pure play, with more than 280 million subscribers. More than a third of video streamers rate Netflix as their favorite streaming platform due to its interface and user experience.\nNetflix is a prolific producer of TV shows and movies to provide its growing user base with more content. It has also expanded into new areas to accelerate its business growth, including live sporting events and video games. Netflix has also started allowing advertisers to tap into its engaged user base.\nThe company's strategy has paid off. It's generating a growing stream of free cash flow. That's allowing it to start returning money to shareholders through a meaningful share repurchase program.\n2. The Walt Disney Company\nThe much-anticipated Disney+ streaming service was launched in late 2019, just in time for the pandemic. By late 2024, Disney had 56 million domestic subscribers and another 66.7 million international ones. Disney also owns streaming services Hulu and ESPN+ in the U.S.\nAfter years of heavy investment, Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming services are now profitable. That helped boost the entertainment, sports, and experiences giant's overall profitability.\nThe company's vertically integrated operations -- spanning valuable real estate assets in its theme parks, merchandising, broadcast television, and in-house video production technology -- give it plenty of cash to invest in new content.\nNow well-established in the online TV era, Disney is poised to continue leading in the streaming revolution.\nVertically Integrated\n3. Roku\nStreaming TV has been a boon for the smart TV and streaming device maker. Roku has become the largest TV platform in the U.S., distributing content via The Roku Channel and acting as a hub for households to manage all their streaming subscriptions. The company has more than 85.5 million active accounts worldwide. They streamed a combined 32 billion hours of content in the third quarter of 2024 alone.\nRoku distributes its smart TV software and streaming devices at minimal cost, making money instead through advertising and by managing subscriptions. In addition, the company acquired Nielsen's Advanced Video Advertising segment to maximize its streaming ad platform's effectiveness.\nActing as the gateway into internet-based TV for tens of millions of households, Roku is a top way to invest in the growing streaming industry. Much like other high-growth streaming platforms, though, Roku has struggled with controlling its costs. Monitor the company's progress as it turns the corner on profitability so it can operate sustainably.\nBest streaming advertising stocks\nBest streaming advertising stocks in 2025\nAdvertising software firms are key to helping streaming video content creators monetize their work and capture new subscribers. They also help companies to advertise within streaming media.\nIn this new era of abundantly available at-home entertainment, traditional media companies are faced with new challenges. Chief among them is paying for and profiting from making a TV show or movie.\nStreaming shows and movies are monetized via monthly subscriptions and online ads rather than global box office or cable TV advertising. As companies seek to advertise via streaming media and content producers look for businesses wanting to purchase ad time, The Trade Desk (TTD -0.79%) and PubMatic (PUBM -2.11%) are well positioned to profit.\n1. The Trade Desk\nThis cloud-based software company is a buy-side platform, meaning it helps automate the purchasing and management of marketing campaigns for companies that pay for advertising.\nStreaming television (also known as connected TV, or CTV) has been one of the fastest-growing segments for The Trade Desk, and it's likely to remain so for some time as the entertainment industry rapidly migrates to internet-based video.\n2. PubMatic\nPubMatic is a sell-side ad platform, meaning its cloud software works with content creators themselves. A sell-side platform is a counterparty to a buy-side platform like The Trade Desk.\nThe company is profitable and focused on ramping up profit margins in the years ahead.\nOther companies offering streaming\nMedia conglomerate companies offer streaming exposure, too\nTelecommunications companies have streaming services, too, such as Comcast's (CMCSA -0.86%) NBCUniversal launching of Peacock. Comcast unveiled plans to spin off its news, sports, and entertainment assets (which include USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, and others) in 2024. That will allow the company to focus on growing its broadband, wireless, streaming, studios, and theme park operations.\nMany of the tech giants offer TV streaming subscription services as well. Amazon (AMZN 0.17%) has Prime Video and add-ons for Prime e-commerce subscribers. Apple (AAPL 3.62%) TV+ has been a steady addition to the iPhone company's \"services\" segment. And Alphabet's (GOOG 8.93%)(GOOGL 9.0%) YouTube TV is a newer subscription designed as an internet-based replacement for cable.\nLegacy companies are also offering new ways to consume live TV over the internet as replacements for traditional cable packages and broadcast television. Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) has reorganized its streaming segment, which includes Paramount+ and the ad-supported service Pluto TV.\nFinally, entertainment conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery (WBD 2.54%), created via the merger of Discovery and WarnerMedia, has a streaming service: Max.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nIs investing in streaming services right for you?\nThe streaming TV industry is a crowded space. Investors should keep in mind that this nascent segment of the entertainment industry is not yet very profitable. However, the field is consolidating to a few leaders focused on profitably accumulating subscribers and bringing their ad marketplaces online.\nAs a result of the sector's rapid changes, stock prices of streaming media companies can be volatile. The long-term growth potential of internet-based TV streaming is immense, with streaming services in the next decade set to recreate the way entertainment is consumed.\nFAQs\nFAQS about streaming stocks\nWhat is the best streaming service to invest in?\nNetflix is the best streaming stock to invest in. It's a pure play on streaming and the industry's leader. It's also growing at a solid clip and increasing its profitability and free cash flow.\nWhat is the fastest-growing streaming company?\nAccording to Forbes, Netflix was the fastest-growing streaming service in the first half of 2024. It added 2.6 million subscribers from December 2023 through the end of May 2024, nearly twice as much as Comcast's Peacock service, which added 1.4 million subscribers.\nWhat are streaming stocks?\nStreaming stocks are publicly traded companies that stream video or audio content over the internet.\nCan you buy stock in HBO?\nNo, you can't buy stock in HBO. However, you can invest in Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO."

      "text": "Government bodies can use tariffs to bolster domestic industries and achieve foreign trade and policy objectives. Read on to learn more about tariffs, the different ways these taxes can be applied, and the roles they can play in international economics and diplomatic relations.\nWhat are tariffs?\nWhat are tariffs?\nTariffs are a form of tax imposed by national or supranational government bodies on the import or export of goods. Tariffs are also sometimes referred to as duties.\nWhy are tariffs important?\nWhy are tariffs important?\nBeyond just being a source of tax revenue, tariffs are a way that governments can modify trade incentives. In particular, tariffs can be important in protecting domestic industries and economic interests.\nTariffs can be a form of economic protectionism, but the costs typically wind up being passed on to domestic shoppers through price hikes on consumer goods. Higher prices on imported goods may give domestically produced goods a competitive advantage, but governments try to strike a balanced approach to tariff policy that works for the good of the broader economy.\nHow do tariffs work?\nHow do tariffs work?\nTariffs are collected when goods exit the domestic area and cross into foreign borders. Import tariffs are far more common than export tariffs. When pursuing growth opportunities in international markets, businesses must be mindful of how tariffs could affect the market for their products and their pricing strategies.\nDifferent categories of products typically have different levels of tariffs applied. For example, vegetables, auto parts, and dairy products have relatively high import tariffs in the U.S., and tariffs on sneakers and tobacco are even higher. On the other hand, not all goods are subject to import duties.\nGovernments will also set tariff levels on a country-by-country basis. In general, countries with less-developed economies tend to have higher tariffs.\nAcademic views on tariffs\nAcademic views on tariffs\nRyan Monarch, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: What are the short and long-term economic effects of tariffs that matter most to investors?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cIn the short-run, tariffs are seen as inflationary, and all else equal, the more widespread the tariffs, the tighter Federal Reserve policy will likely be in order to tamp down upward price pressure. The exchange rate is also likely to appreciate \u2013 as U.S. interest rate policy remains tight relative that of other countries, the dollar is likely to strengthen. The short run is also characterized by significant uncertainty about what trade policy will look like, leading to the pulling back of investment and production for many companies.\nIn the long-run, inflation expectations may become less stable, and as consumers come to expect inflation, this itself can lead the Federal Reserve to take stronger tightening actions. If a global trade war truly breaks out, in which countries continue to escalate tariffs and other actions against each other, the economic consequences for all sides would be dire, and could lead to a major downturn in global growth.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: How do tariffs impact the economy?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cA tariff is a tax on an imported good paid by an importer in order to obtain their purchase after passing through customs. The basic purpose of a tariff is to increase the price of imported goods from a particular country in order to protect domestic producers of that good.\nSince tariffs increase the price of imported goods, tariffs impact the economy in a number of ways. First, average import prices increase as the scope of imported products facing tariffs expands. Second, tariffs tend to lead the imports of the affected goods to decrease. In some cases, affected businesses may substitute to purchasing products from other source countries or domestic alternatives, though the availability of such alternatives varies greatly depending on the imported product. Third, increase in import prices lead to higher costs for businesses using tariffed products as inputs, and affected firms tend to reduce employment, investment, and production in response. In fact, research on the 2018-2019 trade war has shown that job losses at U.S. firms using tariffed inputs well-exceeded job gains in protected sectors, and U.S. exports weakened as a result of higher import tariffs. Finally, government revenue increases as a result of the tax being applied to importers, though tariff revenue is a small fraction of overall government revenue in the United States.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Do tariffs cause inflation?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cTariffs cause the price of affected goods to rise. In fact, research into the 2018-2019 trade war has shown that the prices of U.S. imported goods affected by tariffs rose by nearly the entire amount of tariffs imposed, meaning that U.S. importers bore the brunt of the increase in costs. Additionally, if importers substitute toward alternatives that are more expensive than their original suppliers, this can also cause prices to rise.\nThe extent to which this causes inflation depends on many factors. One consideration is the scope of the tariffs: The more widespread tariffs are, the greater the inflationary pressures will be. It also depends on how importers respond to higher costs: In 2018-2019, many U.S. importers did not pass on the full amount of their cost increase to their consumers, and increases in consumer prices are the traditional metric of inflation. In addition, movements in exchange rates can counteract direct increases in import prices. For example, the dollar typically strengthens after tariffs are imposed, making imports cheaper. Central banks might also respond to widespread tariffs with tighter interest rate policies, also tamping down inflationary pressures. The exact measure of inflation along with the path of tariff increases also matters, as a one-off increase in prices due to tariffs would disappear quickly from short-run measures of inflation. All told, tariffs lead to higher prices, but there are numerous possibilities for how exactly these higher prices may be reflected in overall consumer price inflation.\u201d\nJason Miller, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: Who pays for tariffs imposed on U.S. imports?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cThe importing entity pays the tariffs.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Does the U.S. benefit from tariffs on Mexico and Canada?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cThe U.S. certainly does not economically benefit from tariffs, as tariffs will increase costs (thus contributing to inflation) and disrupt production networks. Prior research documents that U.S. manufacturers that export who saw larger increases in tariffs for the goods they imported from China saw reduced exports in 2019; we would expect the same mechanism to work regarding Canada and Mexico.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Do tariffs have any impact on prices of domestically produced goods?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cYes, especially in the case of metals such as steel and aluminum, domestic producers will increase their prices when foreign goods are subject to more tariffs. We saw this play out in 2018, as steel prices rose sharply that year, roughly 20%.\u201d\nDavid Ortega, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: How will tariffs impact the U.S. economy?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \u201cTariffs function as taxes on imported goods, leading to increased costs for U.S. importers. These heightened costs often translate to higher prices for consumers and businesses relying on these imports to produce goods domestically.\"\nThe Motley Fool: Who pays for tariffs imposed on U.S. imports?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \u201cImporters pay the tariff, which raises their costs, and this gets passed down in the form of higher prices.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Which products are going to cost more due to tariffs?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \"Tariffs will increase the price of food, especially for items that we rely on our trading partners like produce. At the grocery store, the impact will be felt more immediately on perishable products that we import. Food products like avocados, tomatoes, peppers, berries, cucumbers, etc. \u2014 these are products that have a relatively short shelf-life and for which we can\u2019t hold inventory for a prolonged period. Other food and beverage products like imported Mexican beer, tequila, Canadian maple syrup to name a few are likely to see prices increase when tariffs are imposed.\u201d\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nAn example of tariffs in action\nDepending on their scope and application, tariffs can be a source of tension between governments. If one country implements or raises tariffs on another country's goods, there's a risk that the second country will respond in kind.\nIn recent years, the U.S. and China have increased tariffs imposed on each other's products. The U.S. began raising tariffs in 2018 under President Donald Trump, notably implementing a 25% tariff on steel imported from China and raising duties on other materials and products. In turn, China implemented its own tariff hikes on a wide range of goods. The trade squabble between the two countries escalated quickly.\nAlthough a subsequent trade deal helped reduce tensions to an extent, many of the tariffs implemented at the beginning of the trade dispute remain in place. Despite increasingly adversarial relations, trade between the U.S. and China has continued to reach new highs."

      "text": "Cloud computing boomed during the 2010s, but growth in this next-gen IT industry is still in the early innings. For years, organizations around the globe have been migrating their operations to the cloud -- digital data and services stored within a remote data center and accessed via the internet. However, the rise of remote work during the pandemic accelerated the trend. Now, generative AI has kicked off the next wave of cloud expansion.\nBusiness research provider Grand View Research projects that spending on global cloud computing (including data center infrastructure and edge computing) will increase at a 21.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from an estimated $752.4 billion in 2024 to $2.4 trillion in 2030.\nCloud computing is also closely tied to other tech developments such as mobile 5G networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). Clearly, cloud computing stocks are a top investment theme for 2025 and the decade ahead.\nCloud computing stocks for 2025\nInvesting in the best cloud computing stocks of 2025\nTo get started, the best cloud stocks to invest in are the five largest public cloud giants: Amazon (AMZN 0.17%) Web Services (AWS); Microsoft (MSFT -0.02%) Azure; Alphabet (GOOGL 9.0%) (GOOG 8.93%) Google Cloud; Oracle (ORCL -0.79%) Cloud; and IBM (IBM 0.99%) Cloud. Although these companies aren\u2019t pure plays in the cloud industry, all five provide infrastructure and services for organizations undertaking a digital transformation (a phrase that encompasses the migration to cloud-based operations). They have the most complete ecosystems of software and partnerships with third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.\nCloud Computing\nBeyond those big five, here are seven more focused companies that provide portfolio exposure to the development of the cloud:\n| Name and ticker | Current price | Market cap |\n|---|---|---|\n| Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) | $256.96 | $245 billion |\n| Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) | $348.06 | $148 billion |\n| Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) | $229.21 | $77 billion |\n| Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) | $83.47 | $25 billion |\n| ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) | $919.98 | $191 billion |\n| The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) | $53.75 | $26 billion |\n| DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) | $32.04 | $3 billion |\n1 - 2\n1. Salesforce\nWhen talking about cloud computing, Salesforce (CRM 1.62%) needs to be part of the conversation. The customer relationship management (CRM) specialist was a pioneer of software that used cloud technology, which started in the late 1990s. Salesforce has since branched out to other areas of enterprise software via organic growth and a steady stream of acquisitions.\nSalesforce\u2019s takeover of remote work and collaboration tool Slack put it on a collision course with Microsoft\u2019s Teams collaboration suite. Today, Salesforce offers a complete suite of software aimed at helping business teams manage data and get work done efficiently.\nDue to its success in becoming a full-blown tech platform for businesses of all types and sizes, Salesforce is also a top way to play smaller cloud upstarts. It regularly invests in or acquires stakes in smaller cloud peers -- such as when it invested in Snowflake (SNOW -1.88%) before its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020 (and sold it for a profit in 2021). It also acquired a stake in hot IPO Monday.com (MNDY -1.16%).\nSalesforce fell on hard times in 2022 and faced activist investor pressure to boost profit margins. Founder and CEO Marc Benioff and the top team have made progress, though, and hope to become the world\u2019s largest and most profitable enterprise software company within the next few years. It seems to be on the right track. Salesforce reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.21 for fiscal 2023 but booked diluted EPS of $4.20 in fiscal 2024, and management projects fiscal 2025 to be even higher: $6.15 to $6.20.\n2. Adobe\nSoftware company Adobe (ADBE 0.7%) got its start in an IT era that predates both the cloud and the internet. But it has transformed itself into a leader in cloud services by adapting its large and expanding platform to the cloud era. Adobe\u2019s core competencies in providing creativity software and document editing have made it a staple of digital transformation.\nAlthough it isn\u2019t a serial acquirer like Salesforce, Adobe has made some big moves to round out its software suite. In 2018, it acquired small firms Marketo and Magento to bolster its position as a partner for e-commerce companies. In late 2020, it purchased Workfront to add workflow and project management solutions to its arsenal.\nAs a creative software specialist, Adobe is also well suited to tackle the new generative AI era. Its work with top chip designer Nvidia (NVDA -0.24%) helped it quickly release its Firefly suite of apps aimed at helping creatives increase their image and video creation, as well as expanding editing capabilities.\nPaired with the organic growth that Adobe\u2019s legacy offerings still generate, this firm is a top free cash flow generator in the cloud industry. It deserves consideration as a core portfolio holding.\n3 - 4\n3. Snowflake\nThe cloud increases a company's flexibility, often unlocks cost savings, and helps them get more done with the data they have on their operations and customers. However, with the adoption of the cloud comes an explosion of digital data and new security risk considerations. Managing that data is a complex task.\nThat's where Snowflake comes in. It hit the public markets in 2020 with incredible fanfare due to its triple-digit-percentage revenue growth. The stock has fallen since then, and revenue growth has moderated a bit, but Snowflake is now much more reasonably valued.\nSnowflake is an important business that has pioneered new ways for businesses to store, migrate, and process massive amounts of digital information. It continued to expand at a rapid pace even during the bear market of 2022 and despite fears of a recession in 2023. It also began turning a healthy profit, as measured by free cash flow. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, for example, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $496.5 million and $778.9 million, respectively. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, moreover, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $468.6 million.\nSnowflake is a young company, though, and the stock will likely be highly volatile for some time. It's all about growth for this business right now, and even small changes in management's expectations can cause some wild fluctuations in share price. Snowflake could, nevertheless, be a very promising investment for the long term.\n4. Zoom Video Communications\nFew companies have skyrocketed out of obscurity and into household name status as quickly as Zoom (ZM 1.87%). The videoconferencing service became a staple during the COVID-19 pandemic by helping family members and business teams stay in touch from afar (as it turns out, many pre-pandemic in-person meetings weren't all that necessary after all). Zoom is poised to continue as a basic necessity of corporate communications services for a long time.\nZoom is eyeing a bigger piece of the massive global telecom industry by going after large business communications accounts. Zoom Phone accounts, a service for transferring calls across different devices, has steadily grown for years. Zoom's contact center services to manage inbound calls and customer contact have also remained a key growth initiative.\nWhile Zoom struggled with many individual and small business subscribers canceling their service in the wake of the pandemic, it has succeeded in improving its financials over the past couple of years. Growing free cash flow from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024, Zoom projects free cash flow of $1.44 billion to $1.48 billion for fiscal 2025. The company is still benefiting from changes in communications, but it's no longer a growth company. Zoom's top priority now is managing modest revenue expansion while figuring out how to steadily increase earnings for shareholders.\nArtificial Intelligence\n5 - 7\n5. ServiceNow\nThere are greater complexities involved in managing big cloud computing infrastructure, but the cloud also offers the ability to continuously streamline and automate operations. That's ServiceNow's (NOW 0.94%) software specialty.\nBe it digital customer experiences, employee workflow management, or software development, ServiceNow helps about 8,400 companies around the world find chokepoints in their operations. Once these pain points are found, ServiceNow can help suggest and automate fixes.\nIn a new era of AI, ServiceNow could be a big winner, building on its recent success. After growing subscription revenue by 23% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, ServiceNow projects a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of about 19% for fiscal 2025.\nThe company is using Nvidia hardware to make automation even better and even landed Nvidia as a bigger customer using automation software that Nvidia is helping ServiceNow to create. With challenges like labor shortages persisting in the wake of the pandemic, ServiceNow is primed to keep growing.\nIn addition to steady growth, ServiceNow also recently turned profitable by all metrics. This could be a great stock holding for the next decade and beyond as the cloud infiltrates more of the world's corporate operations.\n6. The Trade Desk\nNetflix (NFLX 0.86%) made streaming TV from the cloud an everyday staple. Lots of new internet-based services have come to market in the past couple of years. This has been a boon for digital advertising technologists such as The Trade Desk (TTD -0.79%), a cloud-based offering that helps marketers automate the purchase of digital advertising (known as programmatic advertising).\nDigital ads are dominated by the likes of Google and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), but The Trade Desk\u2019s cloud-based marketing management tools have won over lots of users. It now ranks as the largest independent digital ad management software company. And its rapidly-escalating top-line growth further reflects the massive success it has achieved. From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2023, for example, The Trade Desk has grown revenue at a massive 52% CAGR.\nDespite massive internet growth in the past decade, just over half of marketing spending takes place in a digital format. Digital ads will continue to be a fast-growing industry in the next decade -- especially in at-home entertainment as TV and movies move to an on-demand internet streaming format.\nIn the coming years, streaming services will pick up millions of new household subscribers and account for billions of additional hours spent viewing content. That creates a huge opportunity for The Trade Desk as it manages connected TV advertising activity. Still a small company in a global marketing industry approaching $1 trillion annually and growing, the sky\u2019s the limit for The Trade Desk.\n7. DigitalOcean\nDigitalOcean (NASDAQ:DOCN) is a fresh face in the cloud computing space. It completed its public offering of stock in early 2021. It\u2019s a public cloud infrastructure and software provider similar to Amazon\u2019s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. While the big three focus their attention on large enterprises, DigitalOcean aims at the massive but underserved community of small businesses and start-ups.\nThis is a lucrative niche. Most IT innovations are developed for and funded by large organizations. Yet small businesses still make up about half of the global economy\u2019s production. Most are far behind the curve in making needed digital transformation. That\u2019s where DigitalOcean comes in, providing a full range of affordable services to help small companies find their way in the new cloud era.\nBesides offering cloud infrastructure for small businesses to test and host web-based services and apps, it also offers services for the non-tech-savvy outfit. It acquired a company called Cloudways that offers website building and hosting.\nDespite its tiny size, DigitalOcean is an efficient operation. It generates healthy and growing free cash flow, and while it has generated gross profits for years, it booked positive net income for the first time in 2023, reporting diluted EPS of $0.20. Through the first three quarters of 2024, DigitalOcean has generated diluted EPS of $0.70. This could be a quality small- to mid-cap stock worth investing in for the long haul.\nInvesting in cloud ETFs\nInvesting in cloud ETFs\nFor investors not interested in attempting to pick the best cloud stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also an option. The First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY 0.67%) is the largest cloud ETF around, with about $3.9 billion in assets under management. The fund is a basket of 61 cloud infrastructure and software stocks. It has an ETF expense ratio of 0.6%, meaning it costs $6 per year for every $1,000 invested.\nA more recent arrival is the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU 0.71%). Since the fund launched in early 2019, GlobalX\u2019s cloud ETF has narrowly outperformed First Trust\u2019s offering due to its focus on just 37 stocks, most of which are software companies. The fund is smaller, with about $376 million in assets under management. It has a slightly higher annual expense ratio of 0.68%.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nCloud computing is a long-term growth trend\nCloud computing picked up steam during the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained an enduring growth story even during the bear market. More efficient than legacy IT, it enhances technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and gaming. It gives organizations and their employees more flexibility with important functions such as remote work. The cloud is quickly becoming the basic infrastructure of the future.\nAs is the case with all high-growth stocks, though, investing in cloud companies will have bumps in the road. Investors should stay focused on the long-term potential, not just stock price performance over the course of a year or two. This long-term secular growth trend is poised to remain intact for the next decade and beyond. Cloud stocks should be a top investment priority in 2025."

      "url": "https://www.fool.com/terms/m/market-cap/",
      "text": "Shorthand for \"market capitalization,\" market cap is one way an investor can evaluate how much a company is worth. Market cap refers to the total value of a publicly traded company's shares.\nTo determine a company's market cap, simply multiply the share price by the number of shares outstanding.\nAn example of market capitalization\nAn example of market capitalization\nHere's Costco Wholesale (COST 1.08%) as an example. At recent prices, Costco shares sell for $900, with around 450 million shares outstanding. In this case, $900 times 450 million equals a $400 billion market cap.\nBut why is market cap important and how should you use it? It's one of the best measures of a publicly traded company's size, which can tell you a lot about what to expect if you buy its stock.\n- Large companies tend to have more stable and mature businesses, having proven themselves over time and weathered difficult business conditions to emerge stronger. However, the growth prospects for large companies can be limited because they've already taken advantage of their primary opportunities to grow to their current size.\n- Smaller companies often have more room to grow, but they are typically younger, with riskier business models that haven't yet proved themselves. Their odds of failure can be higher than those of larger companies, which presents added risk.\nHere's a quick breakdown of how market cap ranges are often segmented across companies of different sizes:\n| Type of Stock | Market Capitalization Range |\n|---|---|\n| Mega cap | More than $200 billion |\n| Large cap | $10 billion to $200 billion |\n| Mid cap | $2 billion to $10 billion |\n| Small cap | $300 million to $2 billion |\n| Micro cap | $50 million to $300 million |\nIn general, investors look at the market in the following three categories most often since these are the market cap categories most stocks tend to fall into.\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nLarge-cap stocks have market caps of more than $10 billion. Most of the best-known companies in the world are large caps, and these are typically the companies that have established themselves as the leaders in their industries. While many deal with the ups and downs of their industry's cycles, these are often the strongest companies and have proven capable of holding off competitive threats. Large caps are often where you'll find the best dividend stocks. These large companies often generate more cash than they need for the business and return that extra capital to investors in dividend payments.\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nMid-cap stocks have market caps between $2 and $10 billion, occupying the middle ground between large and small companies. Mid-cap companies often have made considerable progress in building up successful business models, and that gives their investors some stability and protection against the future challenges smaller companies may face. Yet even with some track record, mid caps also may face the daunting task of beating out, or even disrupting, bigger and better-funded large-cap competitors to realize their own financial promise.\nNot all mid caps are growth stocks. They may be companies that operate in a smaller niche without big growth prospects, or they may be former large caps that have declined due to changes in the competitive landscape or (as with many brick-and-mortar retailers) some industry disruption.\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nSmall-cap stocks are generally defined as having market caps between $300 million and $2 billion. Sometimes companies with market caps below $300 million are in this group, although most categorize those as micro-cap stocks. They are generally growth stocks or upstarts just getting their feet under them and looking to do something big. While small-cap stocks have historically delivered above-average returns as a group, many fail to live up to expectations. Small-cap stocks are more volatile than larger caps, meaning there is more risk of losses in the short term. These stocks are generally best owned as a diversified group, and for many years, in order to reduce those risks.\nDividends Per Share\nHow to use market cap\nHow to use market cap\nMarket cap is helpful when evaluating a company's size. But don't let the market value of a company cause you to dismiss large- or even mega-cap stocks as \"too big to buy.\" The global economy is enormous, serving more than 7 billion people and with a fast-growing middle class. A $10 billion company that serves a multi-trillion-dollar market can grow substantially.\nMoreover, companies can deliver strong per-share returns without expanding their market cap fast. Share repurchases that reduce the share count reward long-term investors with a bigger piece of the company, while dividends put money directly back into your pocket. These two things combined can significantly reduce how much market cap needs to grow for investors to get above-average returns.\nRelated investing topics\nConversely, companies -- often small caps that need the cash -- may sell stock to fund growth, pay debt, or just keep the lights on. When this happens, it reduces -- dilutes -- how much of the company each share is worth. For example, if a company with 10 million shares issues and sells 1 million new shares, 10% of your former equity now belongs to the new shareholders. The key here is to consider a company's history of share buybacks and dilution.\nMost investors find that having a diversified portfolio that includes stocks of various market caps is best. It lets you tailor for the desired return and risk levels that meet your goals. If you want your portfolio to be more stable, you'll want a bigger allocation of large-cap stocks. If your primary goal is to increase your portfolio's size as much possible over many years, you'll likely want to own more small- and mid-cap stocks."

      "text": "Forward P/E is a valuation metric that uses earnings forecasts to calculate the ratio of the share price to projected earnings per share. The \"P\" in forward P/E stands for price, or share price. The \"E\" stands for future earnings per share.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is forward P/E?\nForward P/E is a variation of the price-to-earnings ratio that uses an estimate of earnings over the next 12 months to calculate the metric. Unlike the trailing P/E, which uses actual earnings results from the previous 12 months, the forward P/E is based on estimates, and is therefore subject to errors in forecasting.\nTo combat the potential to get the estimated earnings wrong, the forward P/E is typically calculated using a consensus estimate from all analysts who have published their expectations. This wisdom of the crowd approach typically leads to more accurate estimates.\nHow to calculate it\nHow to calculate forward P/E\nThe formula for calculating a forward P/E ratio is very straightforward.\nForward P/E = Current share price / Estimated future earnings per share\nThe hard part is determining the estimated earnings per share. Several resources provide consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts for big companies. Some companies, however, only have a few analysts (and sometimes none) publishing estimates. In those cases it may be worthwhile to dig into the company financials, management\u2019s commentary, and build your own estimate to aggregate with the professionals.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say a stock currently trades for around $150 per share. Analysts expect it\u2019ll produce earnings per share of $6 over the next year. That stock has a forward P/E ratio of 25.\nHow to use it\nHow to use forward P/E\nCalculating the forward P/E of a stock isn\u2019t very useful in and of itself. To get something out of it, you need to calculate the forward P/E of other comparable stocks.\nComparing the forward P/E of two or more companies within the same industry can give you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If one stock has a P/E far greater than its peers, the stock might not be a very good deal.\nBut there are good reasons why a stock may have a high forward P/E. If analysts expect that company\u2019s earnings per share to grow significantly faster than its peers, it\u2019ll value the next 12 months of earnings far higher than a slow-growing company. That\u2019s because a stock price reflects all the future cash flows of a business, not just the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s important to consider that a forward P/E uses earnings per share, or EPS, in the denominator. EPS is itself a ratio, which is affected by the number of shares outstanding. So, if a company has plans to buy back a large percentage of its shares outstanding through a share repurchase program, investors may be willing to pay more for its earnings today.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations of forward P/E\nTo calculate a price-to-earnings ratio, a company needs to have earnings. But not every company produces positive earnings for its shareholders.\nEarly-stage growth companies often produce losses, but their operations show strong potential for earnings at some point in the future. While they invest to grow the business, leverage their fixed operating expenses, and move toward profitability, their stocks technically trade for a negative P/E ratio.\nProfit\nEven when those companies start to make a profit, their relatively minuscule profits relative to the number of shares outstanding can lead to P/E ratios with triple or even quadruple digits. Those valuations aren\u2019t useful for an investing thesis, and forward P/E falls flat in those cases.\nInvestors will be better off finding a different valuation metric to compare growth stocks that are still generating losses for investors. Just because they have extremely high or non-existent forward P/E ratios doesn\u2019t make them bad investments."
