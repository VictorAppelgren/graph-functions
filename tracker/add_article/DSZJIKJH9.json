      "summary": "Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Americans still vividly remember the disaster and its lessons, with a USA Today/Ipsos poll showing 84% believe well‑coordinated emergency response is essential. The survey finds 71% support a major federal role, yet only 30% trust the federal government to handle a major disaster, while 57% back increasing FEMA’s budget. Confidence is higher at state (48%) and local (49%) levels, and partisan divides are stark: Democrats favor federal action more than Republicans. The poll also highlights growing concern over extreme weather, with 58% expecting more frequent events in the near future. These findings underscore the need for stronger disaster preparedness and clearer federal‑state coordination.",
