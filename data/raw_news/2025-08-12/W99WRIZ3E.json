  "content": "As the UK market grapples with the ripple effects of weak trade data from China, leading to declines in major indices like the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, investors are increasingly seeking stability amidst global economic uncertainties. In such a climate, dividend stocks can offer a reliable income stream and potential for long-term growth, making them an attractive option for those looking to navigate these turbulent times.\n\nClick here to see the full list of 56 stocks from our Top UK Dividend Stocks screener.\n\nWe're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool.\n\nOverview: Card Factory plc is a specialist retailer of cards, gifts, and celebration essentials with operations in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Republic of Ireland, the United States, and internationally; it has a market cap of \u00a3355.37 million.\n\nOperations: Card Factory plc generates revenue primarily through its Cardfactory Stores segment (\u00a3506.80 million), supplemented by its Partnerships (\u00a322.20 million) and Cardfactory Online, including Getting Personal (\u00a313.20 million).\n\nCard Factory trades at 52% below its estimated fair value, presenting a good relative value compared to peers. Although its 4.74% dividend yield is lower than the top UK payers, dividends are well-covered by earnings and cash flows with payout ratios of 34.8% and 23.9%, respectively. However, the dividend history is unstable and unreliable due to past volatility despite recent increases over the past decade. The company maintains guidance for mid-to-high single-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2026.\n\u2022 Navigate through the intricacies of Card Factory with our comprehensive dividend report here.\n\u2022 Our comprehensive valuation report raises the possibility that Card Factory is priced lower than what may be justified by its financials.\n\nOverview: Paragon Banking Group PLC offers financial products and services in the United Kingdom with a market cap of \u00a31.78 billion.\n\nOperations: Paragon Banking Group PLC generates revenue through its Mortgage Lending segment, which accounts for \u00a3278.30 million, and its Commercial Lending segment, contributing \u00a3106.80 million.",
