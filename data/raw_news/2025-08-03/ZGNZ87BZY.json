  "content": "The Montana madman who gunned down four people at a smalltown bar could slip back into the neighborhood and threaten residents, police cautioned as their manhunt for the killer continued.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, there\u2019s concerns he might come back into town,\u201d Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen told reporters Sunday as the search for Michael Paul Brown entered its third day.\n\n\u201cThis is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood for no reason whatsoever. So there absolutely is a concern for the public,\u201d Knudsen added. \u201cWe believe this is an armed and extremely dangerous individual.\u201d\n\nBrown, 45, is suspected of walking into the Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, on Friday morning and unloading on patrons and staff with a rifle.\n\nFour people were killed, and he fled from the bar wearing nothing but his underwear and disappeared into nearby countryside.\n\nThe victims were revealed to be bartender Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64, and patrons David Allen Leach, 70, Tony Wayne Palm, 74, and Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59.\n\nBrown lived next door to the bar and was a regular there. While officials said he likely knew most of his victims, no motive has been revealed.\n\nIt remains unclear why Brown was unclothed when he fled \u2014 an eerie scene captured in security footage that showed him creeping down a stone staircase from the bar \u2014 but officials said he is likely fully equipped again after he stole a white pickup truck filled with camping gear.\n\nHe has since abandoned that truck, official said.\n\nAnaconda is located about 25 miles northwest of Butte and near the mountainous border with Idaho.\n\nSearch teams from numerous agencies \u2014 including the federal government \u2014 have joined in the search party, with helicopters scanning the rugged countryside for any signs of the suspect.\n\nResidents were initially ordered to shelter in place after the shooting, but have since been allowed to go about their business.\n\nOfficials have asked they maintain extreme caution, however.\n\n\u201cWe believe he is probably still armed and dangerous,\u201d Knudsen said.\n\nBrown served in the Army from 2001 to 2005 and was deployed to Iraq, then did a three year stint in the Montana National Guard.\n\nFamily said he has struggled with mental health in recent years, and advised that the shooting wasn\u2019t just the act of a \u201chigh man going wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sick man who doesn\u2019t know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn\u2019t know where or when he is either,\u201d Brown\u2019s niece, Clara Boyle, wrote of Facebook.",

      "text": "Police hunt for \u2018extremely dangerous\u2019 vet accused of killing 4 at Montana bar\u2014 and escaping in just his underwear\nThe gunman who allegedly opened fire in a Montana bar and killed four people is a US Army veteran who was photographed leaving the scene wearing nothing but black underpants, authorities revealed.\nThe manhunt for Michael Paul Brown is on its second day after authorities say he opened fire around 10:30 a.m. Friday in The Owl Bar in the small town of Anaconda, located about 25 miles northwest of Butte.\nBrown, 45, escaped down a stone staircase wearing black, brief-style underwear, according to a new surveillance image released by the Montana Department of Justice.\nDavid Gwerder, the bar\u2019s owner, said it\u2019s also likely that Brown \u2013 who lived next door to the watering hole \u2013 knew the three patrons and the bartender, all of whom he\u2019s accused of killing.\n\u201cHe knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,\u201d Gwerder said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any running dispute with any of them. I just think he snapped.\u201d\nThe victims\u2019 names have not been publicly identified.\nFollowing the shooting, Brown drove off in a white pickup truck but later ditched it, ABC 7 reported, citing Montana Division of Criminal Investigation Administrator Lee Johnson.\n\u201cWhile law enforcement has not received reports of Brown harming any other individuals, he is believed to be armed, and he is extremely dangerous,\u201d Johnson said, according to the outlet.\n\u201cThis is a small tight-knit community that has been harmed by the heinous actions of one individual who does not represent what this community of Montanans stand for,\u201d he continued.\nAs reports of the shooting circulated around the town Friday, its less than 10,000 residents took refuge behind locked doors.\nWith no sign of Brown in his vehicle or home, authorities converged by ground and air, and put the Stumptown Road area located just west of Anaconda on lockdown.\nOfficers from local, state and federal agencies were focusing on the same search area Saturday morning, said Chase Scheuer, a spokesperson for the Treasure State DOJ.\nOn Saturday afternoon, Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Police Chief Bill Sather thanked local residents for their patience during \u201cthis very stressful and tragic time\u201d and expressed condolences to the victims\u2019 friends and family.\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to find and bring this perpetrator to justice,\u201d Sather said in a video posted to the department\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to go about your business in town, but please use caution\u2026if you see anything suspicious, please call 911.\u201d\nBrown served in the Army as an armor crewman from January 2001 to May 2005, and was deployed to Iraq for just over a year during that period, said Army spokesperson Maj. Dustin Ramos.\nHe was a member of the Montana National Guard from April 2006 to March 2009, and left the service in the rank of sergeant, according to Ramos.\nBrown struggled with mental health issues in the years leading up to the shooting while relatives desperately sought help for him, said Brown\u2019s niece, Clare Boyle.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a drunk/high man going wild,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook message to the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a sick man who doesn\u2019t know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn\u2019t know where or when he is either.\u201d\nBoyle, who didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment, doubled down in a public Facebook post Friday night.\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re all out here talking about things we\u2019re uncertain of. There is one thing I\u2019m certain of. Mental health is real. And it goes unmanaged and dismissed every single day,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cThere are people who search for help and get turned away at every stop along the path. There are people who cry for help and show DEFINITE warning signs of crash out,\u201d Boyle continued.\n\u201cThe system is broken. The system fails us. When our veterans gets turned away seeking mental health help because \u2018We can\u2019t help unless it\u2019s a harm to self or others.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\nGwerder and Johnson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nWith Post wires"

      "text": "McCloskeys win back AR-15 rifle 5 years after Black Lives Matter protest confrontation\nThe St. Louis couple who went viral in 2020 for wielding guns as Black Lives Matter protesters marched outside their property have regained possession of their semiautomatic rifle.\nAfter a years long and complex legal struggle to reclaim their weapons after they were seized by authorities more than five years ago, police have returned the AR-15 to St. Louis lawyers Mark and Patricia McCloskey.\n\u201cIt only took 3 lawsuits, 2 trips to the Court of Appeals and 1,847 days, but I got my AR15 back!\u201d Mark McCloskey posted to his X account on Friday, along with several photos of him carrying the gun.\n\u201cWe defended our home, were persecuted by the left, smeared by the press, and threatened with death, but we never backed down.\u201d\nIn a separate X post, Mark McCloskey also shared a video of himself retrieving the rifle from a police station.\n\u201cThat gun may have only been worth $1,500 or something, and it cost me a lot of time and a lot of effort to get it back, but you have to do that,\u201d Mark McCloskey told Fox News Digital, adding he owns other weapons. \u201cYou have to let them know that you will never back down, you\u2019ll never give up.\u201d\nHe said he expects their pistol, wielded by Patricia McCloskey during the confrontation, to be returned by next week.\nThe AR-15 ended up in the possession of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, while the pistol wound up in the possession of the St. Louis Sheriff\u2019s Department, he added.\n\u201cEach and every one of us owns a personal responsibility for our freedom and our democratic republic,\u201d Mark McCloskey said.\nIn June 2020, a video of the gun-toting McCloskeys took the internet by storm after a swarm of Black Lives Matter protesters broke down an iron gate and ignored a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign on their private street.\nThe couple, who said they felt threatened, armed themselves before heading outside to ward off the crowd, which was on its way to the former mayor\u2019s home. No one was hurt.\nAfter the incident, the McCloskeys\u2019s were were seized by law enforcement, and they were charged with unlawful use of a weapon by St. Louis\u2019 former Democratic prosecutor, Kim Gardner. Shortly after that, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt moved to dismiss charges brought by Gardner.\nIn 2021, the McCloskeys pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and second-degree harassment but later were granted a pardon by former Missouri Gov. Mike Parson.\nLast month, a Missouri appeals court confirmed the expungement of the McCloskeys\u2019 misdemeanor convictions, which, under state law, means it is as though the incident never happened, Mark McCloskey said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been wronged, if you\u2019ve been overreached by the leftist government \u2014 you can\u2019t give up,\u201d Mark McCloskey told Fox News Digital. \u201cYou can\u2019t let them get an inch.\u201d\nThe St. Louis Sheriff\u2019s Office and the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment."

The MAGA base isn\u2019t letting this issue go, and for the first time, they know they can probably take the party back and not piss off the MAGA base.\u201d\nThe \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d host described Trump as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime, one-on-one, political juggernaut.\u201d Still, he panned Trump\u2019s performance across the board and contended that Americans are still struggling economically under his watch.\n\u201cRight now people are hurting,\u201d Charlamagne argued. \u201cHe campaigned on immediate change. Day one change.\u201d\nHe also pointed to former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley as a Republican he could see himself backing.\nTrump further dinged Charlamagne and accused him of not knowing about his accomplishments in office.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know that, or India and Pakistan or, wiping out Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, or closing the horrendous open Border, or creating the greatest economy, where prices and Inflation have come way down,\u201d Trump vented, referring to his efforts to end wars overseas.\n\u201cBut this dope, Charlamagne, would vote for Sleepy Joe or Kamala?
