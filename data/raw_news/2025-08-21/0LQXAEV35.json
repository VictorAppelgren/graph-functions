  "content": "The Grand Haven City Council recently approved a zoning change requiring short-term rentals in the Centertown Overlay District be located above first-floor retail spaces to maintain the commercial character. Pictured is a MLive file photo of a section of Grand Haven's Centertown on North 7th Street.\n\nGRAND HAVEN, MI - City leaders have given final approval to allowing short-term rentals in the commercial area of a Grand Haven neighborhood bordering downtown.\n\nThe Grand Haven City Council on Monday, Aug. 18, unanimously approved the second reading of a zoning change that will allow people in the Centertown Overlay District to apply for a special land use application to operate a parcel as a short-term rental.\n\nCentertown is the area around Washington Avenue and Seventh Street. There are 23 parcels in the overlay district, which comprises several blocks in the heart of Centertown, that are now eligible to apply for STR use.\n\nThere are approximately 350 registered short-term rental units across the city.\n\nThe city requires any short-term rental in Centertown to be an upper-level unit, as all first-floor parcels must be retail/commercial, and, if using a parking lift, it must meet city weight and size requirements.\n\nThe first reading of the zoning change was approved on Aug. 4.\n\nCentertown resident Peter Wilson spoke at both meetings on the zoning change, expressing concern that the change was approved to benefit one developer.\n\nIn July 2024, Wilson said he spoke to the planning commission about having a short-term rental in Centertown and was told it would not be supported.\n\nAfter seeing the request from local realtor John Groothuis of Capstone Companies to allow STRs in the Centertown district get approved, Wilson said he felt slighted.\n\n\u201cI disagree with the public-facing narrative that this is not to benefit one specific development,\u201d Wilson said on Monday. \u201cThere are similar requests for existing properties that have been soundly rejected that may be equally or more deserving.\u201d\n\nThe city approved a site plan on Aug. 24 for a mixed-use development by Capstone at the southwest corner of Seventh Street and Columbus Avenue.\n\nSteinbech Crossings will be three stories, with commercial business and an enclosed parking garage on the first floor and 12, two-bedroom condos on the second and third levels.\n\nThe condos will be for sale and owners would then have the option to apply for STR use. Currently, the development\u2019s parking plan doesn\u2019t align with the city\u2019s parking requirements for STRs, according to City Planner Brian Urquhart.\n\nWilson\u2019s initial request was asking for more of a \u201cbroad scope,\u201d Urquhart said, allowing STRs in Centertown beyond the central commercial area and into traditional neighborhood areas.\n\n\u201cThat obviously did not receive a favorable response,\u201d Urquhart said.\n\nSeveral meetings were held on the matter, and an April planning commission meeting saw public comments that were \u201clargely in favor of permitting short-term rentals,\u201d according to city records.\n\nBefore voting Monday night, council member Kevin McLaughlin said to Wilson that if he could do the process over again, \u201cit\u2019d be handled differently.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything that went on with this whole process, but we\u2019re just too far down the road and I can\u2019t legitimately say no after everything that has gone on up to this point,\u201d McLaughlin said.\n\nEarlier this month, Mayor Bob Monetza said he wanted to make conservative changes, as the Centertown District is currently working on revamping its long-term master plan.\n\nIn updating the Centertown vision plan, the city\u2019s goal is to have a \u201cstrategic approach to public/private development,\u201d among other things, Urquhart said.\n\nThe plan is expected to identify strategies that would encourage infill development, repurposing existing buildings for new uses and address potential mobility and streetscape improvements.\n\nThe city is currently seeking bid proposals from planning firms to work on the Centertown vision plan. Staff plans to bring a recommendation first to the downtown development authority by September.\n\nA technical grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation is expected to be in the city\u2019s account by October, which will fund the planning process that will then start in November.\n\nUrquhart said there will be an emphasis on public participation, feedback from stakeholders and potentially a \u201cvisioning workshop\u201d with the community.",

      "text": "MUSKEGON COUNTY, MI - Muskegon County moved forward this week with plans to make paths more accessible on the south portion of Dune Harbor Park.\nThe 377-acre park at 3071 Lincoln Ave. in Norton Shores has miles of trails through hardwood forests, dunes and wetlands. The two inland lakes allow for kayaking, fishing and wildlife viewing. The park also fronts Lake Michigan.\nThe Nugent Sand Company previously operated on the site for 101 years.\nRecent erosion from rainwater has made the paths and parking lot at Lincoln Avenue on the south end of the park less accessible, according to Bob Lukens, community development director.\n\u201cThe erosion is pretty extensive there,\u201d Lukens said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some work filling it with rock and other things but it\u2019s not really working well.\u201d\nThe Muskegon County Commission approved Tuesday, Aug. 19, seeking out developers to install curbing, ADA-parking with markings, an ADA-accessible walkway, stairs and a catch basin in the area.\nThe catch basin will redirect the water that\u2019s causing erosion in the parking lot into a rain garden area.\nThat area will be filled with native plants that will organically clean the water before it goes into the South Lake, Lukens said.\nThe estimated cost of the project is $55,000 and will be covered by a $250,000 grant the county received in 2024 from the Consumers Energy Foundation.\nSo far, the grant funds have been used for volunteer projects and educational programming at the park."

      "text": "GRAND HAVEN, MI - A park on Grand Haven\u2019s east side is getting some major improvements this year, starting with a new playground.\nAll but the swing sets are being replaced at Sluka Field park\u2019s playground, 1521 Waverly Ave.\nIncluded in the revamp will be an ADA-accessible merry-go-round with seats, a new climbing structure and sensory toys for younger kids, said Derek Lemke, facilities and grounds manager for the department of public works in Grand Haven.\nThe sand box has been removed.\nThe playground closed on Aug. 8. It is expected to be open by this Friday, Aug. 22. If not, Lemke said it would be completed by Aug. 26 at the latest.\nAfter the new playground is installed, new mulch will be spread on the 4,500 square-foot area.\nThe $51,000 project is being done by the Great Lakes Recreation Company out of Holland.\nThe previous playground was between 15 and 20 years old and had \u201creached a state of disrepair,\u201d Lemke said.\n\u201cIt had become unsafe,\u201d Lemke said, describing rusting and peeling stairs, among other things. \u201cWe had a girl fall and cut her face last winter on it, so it\u2019s not something that would be able to be salvaged.\u201d\nLemke said \u201cso many people\u201d called his department asking if they could have or buy the old playground equipment, which he denied because of safety concerns.\nResidents also asked about having a rubber surface playground, such as the one at the Imagination Station playground at Mulligan\u2019s Hollow behind the Tri-Cities YMCA. Lemke said the \u201cpour in place\u201d playground service is too \u201ccost prohibitive\u201d to do at this time.\nThe neighborhood park is used by the Northwest Ottawa Recreation Authority (NORA), soccer groups, the Tri Cities Kids baseball and softball league and residents in the area.\nOn Sept. 8, the Sluka Field Project will start, which will involve a major renovation of the baseball diamond and park.\nThe dugouts will be removed and replaced with brand new, more accessible ones. There will also be a new seating area, new bleachers installed and fencing replaced around a portion of the park. There will also be new lighting, landscaping, accessible sidewalks and 22 additional parking spots.\nThere are currently 39 spaces and on days where there is overflow, people tend to park on an empty field that will end up being turned into more parking lot, said Dana Kollewehr, assistant city manager.\nThe city was awarded a $293,000 trust fund grant from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in 2024 on the condition that the city provide an equal match to the project.\nIn June, the city council unanimously approved a $534,884.76 bid for Zeeland\u2019s Midwest Construction Group. The project is expected to be complete by November."
