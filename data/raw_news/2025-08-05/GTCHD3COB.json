      "text": "If you were ever instructed to \u201cshake your derri\u00e8re in Der\u00e9on,\u201d then you know Beyonc\u00e9 has a long history of embracing fashion, not only as a spokesmodel, but as a businesswoman.\nHer latest partnership finds the southern songstress teaming up with Levi Jeans, as the brand speaks to the Texan\u2019s current country music era following the release of her Cowboy Carter album. She even has a song on the album dedicated to the iconic denim house, \u201cLEVII\u2019S JEANS\u201d featuring Post Malone. The brand so loved the shout-out, that they\u2019ve embraced the \u201cdouble i\u201d Bey uses within it\u2019s own branding when it comes to their upcoming collaboration and all things Beyonc\u00e9.\nJoin VIBE as we look back on Bey\u2019s fashion-related business ventures, including her House of Der\u00e9on days and collaborations with both TopShop and Adidas, before diving into her latest project with Levi\u2019s.\n-\nHouse Of Der\u00e9on\nNamed after Tina Knowles\u2019 mother Agn\u00e8z Der\u00e9on, Beyonc\u00e9 and mama Tina launched their first House Of Der\u00e9on collection in February 2006 after teasing the label on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Tyra Banks Show. While the label initially fell into the \u201curban\u201d category alongside brands like Kimora Lee Simmons\u2019 Baby Phat and Nelly\u2019s Apple Bottoms, the mother-daughter team were determined to bring couture tailoring and elements to their pieces, elevating the line and offering their demographic of women between the ages of 18 and 35 high fashion-inspired pieces that wouldn\u2019t break the bank.\n\u201cI love the clothes from the \u201970s, my mother\u2019s clothes,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 told EBONY at the time. \u201cI love clothes from the \u201940s, my grandmother\u2019s style, so elegant. We wanted to take elements from my grandmother\u2019s legacy\u2014the beaded lace, lush colors, fine fabrics\u2014and mix them with clothes from my mother\u2019s generation and my generation.\u201d\nWith the tag line, \u201cWhere the sidewalk and catwalk meet,\u201d looks ranged from casual sweatpants and hoodie dresses to gowns that were often rocked by the ladies of Destiny\u2019s Child on various red carpets.\nThe brand found success not only thanks to Tina\u2019s eye for design and Bey\u2019s star power, but strategic partnerships with the likes of ABC, Sony Music, E! Entertainment and L\u2019Or\u00e9al, manager Mathew Knowles told WWD at the time.\nThe brand gained enough success to launch in the UK in 2011. One year later, however, Der\u00e9on terminated its junior line and reduced staff, slowly closing the brand for good over the next few years.\n-\nIvy Park/ TopShop\nFour years after the demise of House Of Der\u00e9on, Bey and retail businessman Sir Philip Green co-founded Ivy Park, an athleisure clothing line launched as a joint venture between Bey\u2019s Parkwood and Green\u2019s Top Shop, where the brand was exclusively available. The line featured tops and bottoms that could take you to from the gym to a casual night out, as well as swimwear and accessories, all ranging from $30 to $200.\nWhile \u201cIvy\u201d was obviously inspired by her first born \u2014 who also appeared in the first ad for the brand \u2014 Bey went on to explain the significance of \u201cPark\u201d within the brand\u2019s name to Elle at the time, sharing within the 2016 interview, \u201cIt\u2019s anywhere we create for ourselves. For me, it\u2019s the place that my drive comes from. I think we all have that place we go to when we need to fight through something, set our goals and accomplish them.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the essence: to celebrate every woman and the body she\u2019s in while always striving to be better,\u201d she went on about the brand. \u201cIt\u2019s not about perfection. It\u2019s about purpose. We have to care about our bodies and what we put in them. Women have to take the time to focus on our mental health \u2014 take time for self, for the spiritual, without feeling guilty or selfish. The world will see you the way you see you, and treat you the way you treat yourself.\u201d\nWith the partnership lasting just over two years, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Parkwood acquired total ownership of Ivy Park from Green in 2018.\n-\nIvy Park/ Adidas\nAfter acquiring the brand in full, Beyonc\u00e9 brought Ivy Park to Adidas for \u201cthe partnership of a lifetime.\u201d\n\u201cAdidas has had tremendous success in pushing creative boundaries. We share a philosophy that puts creativity, growth and social responsibility at the forefront of business. I look forward to re-launching and expanding Ivy Park on a truly global scale with a proven, dynamic leader,\u201d Bey said ahead of the relaunch, via a statement on the Ivy Park website.\nOne week before the January 2020 release, Bey sent PR packages to celebrities including Angela Bassett, Missy Elliott, Ciara, and others, further building anticipation for the collection. Within hours of the pre-sale and only six minutes into the official release, the collection was sold out on Adidas\u2019 website, which crashed several times due to overactivity. Subsequent drops were just as successful, with Bey and team warning potential shoppers to move quickly if they wanted to purchase coveted items before they sold out. Fans often complained of items being unavailable due to resellers purchasing and marking up the prices on sites like StockX and eBay.\nBrick-and-mortar fans were able to make purchases at Bloomingdale\u2019s, Nordstrom, Foot Locker, and Finish Line stores.\nWhile the Ivy Park drops kept us in a chokehold throughout the pandemic, a source at The Wall Street Journal claimed in February 2023 that sales were declining and didn\u2019t live up to Adidas\u2019 expectations for the collaboration. The report came one month before The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Ivy Park and Adidas would be amicably going their separate ways due to \u201cmajor creative differences.\u201d\n-\nLevi\u2019s\nBey\u2019s latest collaboration is with Levi\u2019s Jeans, a brand that epitomizes the singer\u2019s current country era. One week after teasing the collaboration on social media, the denim staple debuted a reimagined campaigned starring Queen Bey, with its first commercial drawing from the 1985 \u201cLaundrette\u201d ad that catapulted \u201cI Heard It Through the Grapevine\u201d on the Billboard charts.\n\u201cMy song \u2018Levii\u2019s Jeans\u2019 celebrates what I believe is the ultimate Americana uniform \u2014 something we all wear with pride. I am honored to work with Levi\u2019s to create quintessential American iconography,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 shared in a statement. \u201cDenim on denim has often been seen through a male lens, so this reimagining campaign, which celebrates the iconic female perspective, is important to me. I look forward to exploring innovative ways for our visions to align in empowering women and honoring their strength.\nKenny Mitchell, Levi\u2019s global chief marketing officer, said of the collaboration with Bey, \u201cThis campaign is celebrating two icons. It\u2019s inspired by Levi\u2019s and our unparalleled history and impact over time, as well as Beyonc\u00e9, who\u2019s a culture shaping artist and icon. Levi\u2019s has and continues to outfit the world\u2019s changemakers, the Originals as we call them, the icons. We like to say that we\u2019re like the unofficial uniform of progress and people that are moving forward \u2014 in the pursuit of better, whether that\u2019s big or small.\u201d"

      "text": "Beyonc\u00e9 feels act ii: COWBOY CARTER is \u201cthe best music I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d and after personally having it on repeat since its release, she makes a very strong and compelling argument.\nWith her eighth studio album, the Houston native has already made history as the first Black female artist to top Billboard\u2018s Hot Country Songs chart and rank No. 1 on their Hot 100 Chart with one of the LP\u2019s lead singles, \u201cTEXAS HOLD \u2018EM.\u201d Overall, COWBOY CARTER is a melting pot of several genres with deep roots in country music.\n\u201cThe joy of creating music is that there are no rules,\u201d said Beyonc\u00e9 in a statement. \u201cThe more I see the world evolving the more I felt a deeper connection to purity. With artificial intelligence and digital filters and programming, I wanted to go back to real instruments, and I used very old ones. I didn\u2019t want some layers of instruments like strings, especially guitars, and organs perfectly in tune. I kept some songs raw and leaned into folk. All the sounds were so organic and human, everyday things like the wind, snaps and even the sound of birds and chickens, the sounds of nature.\u201d\nMusicianship aside, the captivating, audacious, and occasionally vulnerable storytelling on the project speaks to Beyonc\u00e9 reclaiming her narrative and the humanization of her as a mother, artist, wife, daughter, and more. Not to mention, it\u2019s a continuation of her dynamic 2022 release, act i: RENAISSANCE.\nThough this new album only contains 27 out of the 100 songs recorded, it contains so much richness and freedom. With an emphasis on the stories behind the music, we\u2019ve compiled a list of 10 of the most quotable lyrics from COWBOY CARTER\u2014which have Bey either talking her s**t, praising women with homegrown curves, discussing one\u2019s power or have us ready to saddle up with a lover.\nCheck it out below.\n-\n\u201cAMERIICAN REQUIEM\u201d\n\u201cUsed to say I spoke, \u2018Too country\u2019 / And the rejection came, said \u2018I wasn\u2019t country \u2018nough\u2019/ Said I wouldn\u2019t saddle up, but / If that ain\u2019t country, tell me what is?\u201d\n-\n\u201cSWEET HONEY BUCKIIN'\u201d\n\u201cJiffy cornbread, booty cornfed/ Body rolls at the rodeo\u201d\n-\n\u201cJOLENE\u201d\n\u201c\u201dThere\u2019s a thousand girls in every room/ That act as desperate as you do/ You a bird, go on and sing your tune/ Cause I hate to have to act the fool/ Your peace depends on how you move\u201d\n-\n\u201cII HANDS II HEAVEN\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a stallion runnin\u2019, no candle in the wind/ You won\u2019t ever see me comin\u2019 or goin\u2019 but you\u2019ll know whenever I\u2019m here/ Dancin\u2019 in the moonlight, catchin\u2019 every breeze\u201d\n-\n\u201cDAUGHTER\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t fellowship with these fak\u0435 ones\u201d\n-\n\u201cRIIVERDANCE\u201d\n\u201cYour words, they take the shape my body makes/ Ain\u2019t that the scary thing\u201d\n-\n\u201cTYRANT\u201d\n\u201cHave you seen her? 5\u20199\u201d, thick and fine, what a tragedy\u201d\n-\n\u201c16 CARRIAGES\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t got time to waste, I got art to make/ I got love to create on this holy night/ They won\u2019t dim my light, all these years I fight.\u201d\n-\n\u201cYA YA\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s pickin\u2019 up good vibrations/ He\u2019s lookin\u2019 for sweet sensations\u201d\n-\n\u201cLEVII\u2019S JEANS\u201d\n\u201cNeed you all night long, you\u2019re my Renaissance/ Baby, lovin\u2019 you, that\u2019s all I see/ In this crazy world, you\u2019re the best of things\u201d"

      "text": "For the Grammy Award-winning director, when it comes to surpassing rungs on her never-ending list of goals, the sky\u2019s the limit.\nThere\u2019s something thrilling about knowing the height of your potential, being keenly aware that your wildest dreams have such a favorable rate at coming into fruition, but not knowing what those direct steps to get there look like. Stepping out and up blindly, sliding and poking your foot out ahead of yourself as if shuffling in the dark, only sure enough there is, in fact, more ladder to climb. While natural fear when contemplating the \u201chow\u201d of it all nestles quietly in the background, the rush of each steady accomplishment and the roar of supporters celebrating them drown it out.\nMelina Matsoukas has a fan club of trendily dressed young creatives waiting for her outside of a makeshift \u201cgreenroom\u201d in the basement of New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. During her Master Class for Fusion Film Festival, current Tisch students just finished listening to her wax poetic about all the hard work and good fortune that happened to her\u2014and that they hope will soon happen to them\u201414 years after walking away from the same prestigious school with her Bachelor in Fine Arts in tow.\nAfter falling in love with filmmaking on a laughable note her first year in the program\u2014\u201cI went to the Meatpacking District and shot a really bad film about how women were viewed as meat and shot hanging meat in the street,\u201d she told the auditorium\u2014Matsoukas eventually moved on to some career-defining cinematic work. You\u2019ve seen her fingerprint in narrative-style music videos for Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cSensual Seduction,\u201d Solange\u2019s \u201cLosing You,\u201d Rihanna\u2019s \u201cWe Found Love\u201d and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cFormation,\u201d with the latter two winning Grammy Awards. In addition to advertising campaigns for Adidas, Absolut, Diet Coke and Lexus, Nike recently tapped Matsoukas for their gripping black and white \u201cEquality\u201d campaign featuring LeBron James, Serena Williams, Kevin Durant, Gabby Douglas Michael B. Jordan, Alicia Keys and more.\nWith a those two Grammys and a coveted Beyonc\u00e9 affiliation, the NYC-born boss\u2019 stock became higher than ever, so high that it ushered her into the next phase of her career, one that she sees as a whole new start. \u201cDefinitely directing and executive producing an entire season of Insecure is probably my greatest achievement thus far, professionally,\u201d she tells me later. When she showed the trailer for Season 1 of the HBO series during the Master Class, the audience laughed as if they didn\u2019t already watch the entire series five months ago and cheer for the swift announcement of a second season, which the core team just started prepping for at the top of March.\nMatsoukas had been searching for a story to tell, and asked her film agent to get her a TV agent to search for tales in that space. \u201cI got a young black woman agent and she kinda just knew what I would be attracted to,\u201d she says. \u201cShe sent me this pilot for Insecure. I never saw myself as a comedy director but when I read those pages, I said wow, this is my life on the page.\u201d Insecure\u2019s core theme\u2014a young black woman navigating through life, love and friendships, not fitting in and not necessarily identifying with the idea of what a black woman is\u2014also won over the hearts of hesitant HBO execs.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t normally do this. We don\u2019t normally give a first-time creator, a first-time show runner and a first-time director an opportunity to do something together but let\u2019s do it,\u201d HBO\u2019s then-President of Programming Michael Lombardo had told her, referencing Issa Rae and Prentice Penny. But Matsoukas, and the 1.18 million viewers who tuned into the series premiere on Oct. 9, 2016, are happy he did.\n\u201cI think the most poignant thing [to include in Insecure] was having those strong female relationships like Issa and Molly do, and having that strong sense of camaraderie and love and support for each other,\u201d she says, stressing the outpour of support from her own girl gang and those who are cheerleaders of her creative eye. \u201cI do it for us,\u201d she continues, \u201cfor all the women and the men and the people that aren\u2019t represented.\u201d Now that TV is slowly starting to diversify its casts and its messages, it\u2019s important for Matsoukas to push the perspectives of her people and her peers into the lily-white mainstream any chance she gets. Matsoukas believes that a lot of the time, racism is unconscious and systematic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging in that you can\u2019t relate because you don\u2019t know our history or we don\u2019t speak the same language, or I speak a certain way that is offensive to you or I look a certain way,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a fight I\u2019ll never stop fighting [but] we shouldn\u2019t be the only ones talking about diversity and equality for women and people of color. That\u2019s everybody\u2019s burden to bear.\u201d\nCiting director Julie Dash as one of many integral inspirations, especially as a black woman in the entertainment space, Matsoukas is pacing herself for the long road ahead of her, knowing that people are looking to her not only for inspiration, but also for a way out. Or rather, a way in.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so proud, you know?\u201d she says, reflecting. \u201cI\u2019m proud of who I am. I\u2019m proud of my history. I\u2019m proud of the women and the men who came before us who are black, and I\u2019m proud of the women before me who are black and who have achieved so much, even though we have so much against us and we don\u2019t have those doors opening for us everyday. We\u2019ve really had to fight our way through. I wear that proudly and try to represent us well and continue on that path that I\u2019ve been given and try to make it a little wider for the next person.\u201d"
