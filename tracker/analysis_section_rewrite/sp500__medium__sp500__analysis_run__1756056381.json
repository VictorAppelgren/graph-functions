      "feedback": "Strengthen the piece by turning it into a tight 3–6 month scenario map with explicit timing, triggers, and invalidations anchored to the cited sources; currently the threads exist but lack precise windows and threshold events. Build four catalysts with dates and thresholds: (i) GM’s domestic-capex cadence and production ramp, anchored to the $4B GM manufacturing investment narrative and timing in WTNT85IPR; (ii) AI/infra cycle momentum led by Nvidia and the Wedbush AI 30 reshuffle (additions: CrowdStrike, Roblox, GE Vernova, Nebius) plus a quantified data-point like data-center electricity demand near 945 TWh by 2030 to ground the TAM; cite STBVARD8F and WTNT85IPR/4661GWFP7; (iii) Coca‑Cola’s Costa Coffee sale with price ~£2B and the potential reallocation of capital, per STBVARD8F; (iv) Disney’s shift away from early park-entry to a Lightning Lane model with last-use 1/4/2026, per U3ZK13ZQI. Add invalidation rules: tariff escalation beyond 25% on autos or a stalled Costa sale (WTNT85IPR/STBVARD8F); Disney uptake disappoints or Costa bid collapses. Quantify the base and alt paths with concrete ranges and payoffs: base-case upside from a domestic-capex AI-enabled upcycle; Alt-1: AI/security/infra leadership rotation (CrowdStrike-type beneficiaries) with higher dividend-quality exposure; Alt-2: defensives with durable cash flows (KO, PG, XOM, SO) yielding the yields shown in the sources (KO forward ~2.89% per STBVARD8F; PG ~2.66% per YX2J8NHZ1; XOM ~3.7% per YX2J8NHZ1; SO ~3.1% per YX2J8NHZ1). Deepen the linkage to flows and valuation: tie KO/PG/XOM/SO to dividend-growth history and current multiples (P/E/forward yields from KO and PG data in STBVARD8F/YX2J8NHZ1) and position the IUSV-like low-vol tilt as ballast (4661GWFP7). Clarify causal chain: policy/trade inputs shape capex and pricing power; AI leadership sustains platform demand and data-center load; consumer/leisure shifts reprice discretionary exposure; this yields a coherent cross-asset transmission. Improve structure and language to reduce hedging-by-default language and instead present a two-line base case with four crisp catalysts and a separate, numbered watch-list. Ensure every substantive claim cites a source ID immediately after the claim, reconcile any minor conflicts (e.g., Costa/North America growth vs. Costa’s sale tone), and keep the write-up within a single compact paragraph while preserving the base-case, 1–2 alts, risks, and watch-list signals.",
