  "title": "Why does Aaron Rodgers hate his new helmet? Steelers QB bemoans 'spaceship' fit",
  "description": "Aaron Rodgers is being forced to wear a new helmet after his previous choice was banned, and the Steelers QB is no fan of his new model.",
  "content": "\u2022 Aaron Rodgers is adjusting to a new helmet, the Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II, after his preferred model was banned by the NFL.\n\u2022 Rodgers has expressed his dislike for the new helmet, citing discomfort and fit issues, particularly with the face mask.\n\u2022 Rodgers has worn Schutt helmets for 20 years and has had to switch models multiple times due to NFL and NFLPA safety regulations.\n\nAaron Rodgers has more to get acclimated to this summer than his new Pittsburgh Steelers teammates.\n\nThe four-time NFL MVP is still getting used to his new helmet model, the Schutt Air XP Pro Q11 LTD, which he has opted to don in the wake of his previous preferred gear being banned by the league. And the quarterback has made it clear he's no fan of the alternative, with the fit proving to be particularly problematic.\n\n\"I don't like it, no,\" Rodgers, 41, said Tuesday. \"I'm trying to change. We're in the process still. It looks like a damn spaceship out there.\"\n\n\"We got to change it. The face mask doesn't fit the helmet because that's an old face mask, obviously just like I'm old, but we're trying to find the right helmet right now.\"\n\nWhat helmet is Aaron Rodgers wearing with the Steelers?\n\nRodgers is currently wearing the Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II. Since signing with the Steelers in June and first trying out the model during mandatory minicamp, the quarterback hasn't been able to get settled with the new helmet.\n\n\"I can\u2019t stand the helmet,\" Rodgers said in June. \"I\u2019ve worn a Schutt for 20 years and somehow it finally didn\u2019t pass the safety standards.\"\n\nWhy was Aaron Rodgers forced to switch to a new helmet?\n\nThe Schutt Air XP Pro Q11 LTD that Rodgers wore with the New York Jets in 2024 was one of seven models banned by the NFL in April as part of its annual testing conducted in collaboration with the NFL Players Association. The version was fully outlawed after being in the \"not recommended\" category for last season.\n\nPrior to signing with the Steelers, Rodgers acknowledged the need for a new helmet and said he expected to switch to another Schutt model. The quarterback has worn multiple different versions since the NFL and NFLPA began making some helmets off limits starting in 2018.\n\n\"I don't know the inner workings of Schutt,\" Rodgers said in April, \"but if I were to play, I'm going to wear Schutt if they're still going. If they've still got a good helmet that passes some sort of test, that's what I'm going to wear.\"",

      "text": "Aaron Rodgers helmet: Steelers QB forced to switch following NFL ban\nAll offseason long, everyone wanted to know what was on Aaron Rodgers' mind. Now that he officially signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers and participated in mandatory minicamp, the focus has shifted to what is on his head.\nAs Rodgers enters his 21st season in the league with his third team, he'll be doing so with some new headgear when he takes the field.\nRodgers has famously worn a Schutt helmet throughout his career, a look that had become synonymous with the four-time NFL MVP. After donning the Schutt Air XP Pro Q11 LTD model in 2024 with the New York Jets, the NFL banned that helmet earlier this offseason due to safety concerns.\nThe quarterback is now left to seek some new protection for his head. Following his first minicamp practice on Tuesday, Rodgers made it clear he's not a fan.\n\"I can\u2019t stand the helmet,\" Rodgers told reporters. \"I\u2019ve worn a Schutt for 20 years and somehow it finally didn\u2019t pass the safety standards.\"\nIt appeared the quarterback elected to wear a Schutt F7 Pro model helmet on Tuesday, which passed the NFL's annual study.\nNFL Network's Mike Garafolo noted that Rodgers' preferred helmet was \"not recommended\" last season, so players were still allowed to use it.\nFollowing the annual helmet performance and safety study, the NFL and the NFL Players Association banned seven additional models this offseason. They are:\n- Riddell Foundation\n- Riddell Speed Icon\n- Riddell Speed\n- Riddell Revolution Speed Classic\n- Schutt Air XP Pro Q11 LTD\n- Xenith Epic+\n- Xenith Epic\nIt's not the first time Rodgers was forced to change his helmet. After beginning his career wearing a Brett Favre-style helmet, the quarterback switched following a pair of concussions.\nIn 2019, Rodgers faced a similar situation when the NFL banned his preferred option. Then-Las Vegas Raiders' receiver Antonio Brown famously threatened to retire as a result of the decision but ultimately continued his career until 2021.\nRodgers seemed to strike a different chord that offseason, saying that it \"isn\u2019t difficult at all\" to make the change.\n\u201cThe way they make helmets these days, they do a great job of molding it to your head \u2013 the fit is spectacular,\u201d Rodgers said via Yahoo Sports. \u201cI can go from this helmet to a VICIS helmet to a different helmet, and as far as the fit is concerned, you don\u2019t really notice the difference at all. It fits really nicely.\u201d\nThat year, Rodgers was choosing between a Schutt or VICIS model helmet, the latter being a company in which he had invested in 2018, according to Forbes.\nIt's unclear if the quarterback will opt for one of the company's nine helmets that tested well in the NFL's study or stick with a Schutt model again.\nLuckily for him, there's plenty of time to find the right fit before kickoff in September."

      "text": "Aaron Rodgers, Pittsburgh Steelers agree to one-year contract\nThere's a new sheriff in town in Pittsburgh.\nVeteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers have agreed to terms on a one-year contract, the team announced Thursday night. The completion of the deal is contingent on Rodgers passing a physical.\nRodgers will fly to the Steel City to sign with the team ahead of mandatory minicamp next week, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Gerry Dulac and NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\nThe Steelers will be the third team Rodgers has played for in his career. He spent his first 18 years in the NFL with the Packers and the last two seasons with the Jets.\nRodgers, who will turn 42 next season, led New York to a 5-12 record in his only full season with the team. The 20-year NFL veteran missed almost the entirety of the 2023 season when he ruptured his Achilles four plays into his first game with the Jets.\nThe 2024 season was statistically one of Rodgers' worst, according to composite statistics like passer rating \u2013 a stat in which Rodgers is the all-time career leader \u2013 and ESPN's QBR. Rodgers finished last year with a 90.5 passer rating, 1.8 points below the league average. His 48.0 QBR ranked 31st, just behind Kirk Cousins, C.J. Stroud and Aidan O'Connell.\nThe four-time NFL MVP now joins the Steelers, trying to bring them back to the playoffs for a third straight year and win their first postseason game since 2016.\nPittsburgh finished the 2024 season with a 10-7 record and lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the wild-card round.\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.
