  "title": "New Chinese electric car heading to the UK that\u2019s backed by Ford boss",
  "description": "This new Chinese electric car has been formally endorsed by the head of Ford and could be a top seller when it heads to the UK.",
  "content": "A Chinese electric vehicle praised by the head of Ford looks set to hit the UK market sooner rather than later. Chinese brand Xiaomi, which primarily manufactures mobile phones alongside electric vehicles, has confirmed they are researching a European expansion. The move could be completed in a matter of years, with a potential 2027 entry into the EU possible. The Chinese marque launched the SU7 Sedan, the company\u2019s first electric vehicle, back in March 2024. The model has quickly become one of the top sellers in the Asian market with over 135,000 units sold last year.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Xiaomi has opened up about their plans to move overseas with President Lu Weibing previously hinting at a move. He posed with an SU7 Ultra with German license plates before explaining it was his company\u2019s first experimental EV in Europe. The Xiaomi SU7 Max is one of the most impressive models on the market with the all-wheel drive Sedan offering up to 673hp. The model benefits from impressive torque with the SUV capable of hitting 62 mph in under 3 seconds and a top speed of 165mph. Inside, the model is packed with technology including a 16.1 inch infotainment screen, 56-inch Heads Up Display and even a rotating dashboard. The SU7 Max reportedly offers a staggering range of up to 497 miles on a single charge through its 101kWh battery, putting it near the very top of what EVs can offer.\n\nAlthough pricing has yet to be confirmed, it is expected that the model could be available for around \u00a360,000 once it arrives on European and UK shores. The car has even enjoyed a shock endorsement from none other than Jim Farley, CEO of the Ford Motor Company. Jim doesn\u2019t just love the Xiaomi, he owns one, with the Ford boss admitting that he had imported the car from China to the United States. Speaking to the Everything Electric Show podcast, Jim said: \u201cI don't like talking about the competition so much but I drive a Xiaomi (SU7). We flew it from Shanghai to Chicago. I've been driving it for 6 months now, and I don't want to give it up\" Despite plans for a move, Xiaomi has also warned they would still prioritise meeting their domestic delivery demand before getting ready for new overseas markets.",
