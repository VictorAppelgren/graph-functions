  "title": "Cate Blanchett Doesn't Know If Her 'Squid Game' Cameo Will Lead to More (But She'd Like it to)",
  "description": "The actress had a rather unconventional entry into the Netflix blockbuster series.",
  "content": "That shocking finale coda of Hwang Dong-hyuk\u2019s Squid Game series left many curious about what it meant for the American spin-off Netflix has in the works. When the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) pauses next to an alley in downtown Los Angeles, you witness, along with him, the Squid Game recruitment ritual being administered by a new face: Cate Blanchett, wearing a suit and offering up the Ddakji slaps.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe the Academy Award-winning actress was only recruited for a one-off cameo right after she claimed to be retired. In an interview with Variety, Blanchett discussed how the guest role came to be and what it might mean for her future in the franchise. \u201cBecause it\u2019s such a cult series and they were shooting in L.A. of all places, everyone was on a need-to-know basis,\u201d she said of the \u201cout of the blue offer\u201d that stipulated she bring her own suit.\n\n\u201cI got a couple of storyboards. I had to [learn to] play the game very quickly. I had to practice and practice. I knew there were four or five setups that they were going to do, and I knew what they needed from every shot, and then I was given the sides. But it was one of the more mysterious jobs.\u201d\n\nBlanchett explained that while her role was a feature on the series finale, she\u2019d consider returning. \u201cI am wildly open to anything,\u201d she shared with the trade, \u201cand in a world that is so beautifully, magically created like that, for sure. They\u2019re amazing world-builders, and that series has been eaten alive. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a corner of the globe that it hasn\u2019t touched in some way.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s so playfully suspicious about her answers is that Netflix has enlisted David Fincher for his take on the American Squid Game spin-off. And he happens to be a filmmaker Blanchett worked with on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, so what gives? Nothing, apparently, just coincidence. The actress affirmed to Variety, \u201cI mean, I\u2019d love to work with David again. It\u2019s been ages. But no, I don\u2019t know anything more than you do. I\u2019m not being coy. I really don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "The third and final season of Netflix\u2019s Squid Game is filled with unforgettable moments. Series finales usually are. But even after everything is wrapped up in the games themselves, the show had one final surprise for audiences, and it\u2019s a doozy. We\u2019ve written about it here but now, the show\u2019s creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has weighed in about what he meant with the scene, what it implies, and why he cast that person. Of course, major spoilers follow.\nAt the very end of Squid Game 3, the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) is driving through the streets of Los Angeles when he sees a familiar sight. It\u2019s two people playing ddakji, the game his team uses in Korea to recruit people for the bigger event. He\u2019s seemingly taken aback because it\u2019s confirmation of what he\u2019s surely always thought\u2014these games are happening everywhere. And we, as the audience, are taken aback because the person doing the recruiting is Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett.\nWhile this scene clearly seems to be teeing up some future American Squid Game spinoff, that was not Hwang\u2019s main intention. \u201cI didn\u2019t end it on that note in order to deliberately leave room for further stories to happen,\u201d the creator told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cGi-hun [Lee Jung-jae\u2019s character] and Front Man, through these characters, the Games in Korea have ended. And because this story started out with me wanting to tackle issues about the limitless competition and the system that\u2019s created in late capitalism, I wanted to leave it on a note highlighting the fact that these systems, even if one comes down, it\u2019s not easy to dismantle the whole system\u2014it will always repeat itself. That\u2019s why I wanted to end it with an American recruiter. And I wrote that scene wanting an impactful ending for the show, not in order to open rooms for anything else.\u201d\nThough, of course, it does just that, especially when you cast a major A-list actress like Blanchett. Hwang also talked about how that came to be. \u201cIn the beginning, I was tossing around different ideas. I thought, \u2018Should it be a man that we see as the recruiter?\u2019 But I thought that, unlike in [the] Korea [version], having a woman who\u2019s a recruiter for the American system would be a nice contrast and also quite a powerful, impactful element,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we were set on having a woman. Then I thought, \u2018Who would be the right fit for that?\u2019 It\u2019s a very short scene. There\u2019s only one line, so we needed someone who had that level of presence and charisma to completely dominate the screen in that instant. And that naturally led me to Cate Blanchett. I\u2019ve always been a fan of hers. She\u2019s someone who can instantly grab your attention with a single stare. So that\u2019s how that\u2019s how we set on her.\u201d\nHwang also admits that he has no plans to do another Squid Game, nor has he heard anything about what David Fincher has reportedly been working on. But if and when any of that does happen, he\u2019ll be watching. \u201cHonestly, nothing has been said to me officially by Netflix about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve only read it in articles myself as well. I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of David Fincher\u2019s work \u2014from Seven and I\u2019ve loved his films. So if he were to create an American Squid Game, I think that would be very interesting to watch. I would definitely click on it immediately after it\u2019s released, if it were to happen.\u201d\nTo read more from Hwang Dong-hyuk about the end of Squid Game 3, such as the decision to kill Gi-hun and more, head over to the Hollywood Reporter. All three seasons of Squid Game are now on Netflix.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Cate Blanchett on Her One Note When Joining \u2018Disclaimer,\u2019 Portraying a Victim of Abuse and How She Landed That Surprising \u2018Squid Game\u2019 Cameo\nCate Blanchett is no stranger to playing complicated, misunderstood women. But in Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cDisclaimer,\u201d Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s seven-part series about a documentarian whose deepest, darkest secrets come to light in a novel written by an unreliable narrator, the two-time Academy Award winner, and now three-time Emmy nominee, was tasked with embodying an embattled woman who loses control of her own story.\n\u201cThe challenge for me, and I suppose the painful reality, was that when you play a central character in a narrative, you invite an audience not necessarily to have empathy with you, but you invite them into your character\u2019s point of view,\u201d Blanchett says from her home in London. \u201cDisclaimer\u201d was the \u201cantithesis\u201d of that conventional wisdom, forcing Blanchett to sit in others\u2019 snap judgments of her character, Catherine Ravenscroft, until she finally reclaims her story in the harrowing finale.\n\u201cI, as an actor and as a character, was put inside a very small box that was slowly having the air squeezed out of it until I finally got to speak,\u201d explains Blanchett. \u201cAlfonso has impeccable judgment, but there was a conversation at one point where a certain scene wasn\u2019t going to be in the final edit. And I said, \u2018I think it\u2019s really important that the people hear that perspective, because we\u2019ve asked them to sit through Catherine\u2019s silence. She has to say why she didn\u2019t speak. Otherwise, we are robbing the audience of the full stop.\u2019\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuar\u00f3n approached Blanchett about collaborating on an adaptation of Ren\u00e9e Knight\u2019s 2015 novel, which he had read before making \u201cRoma.\u201d It would be expanded into seven episodes \u2014 or, as the filmmaker likes to put it, seven \u201cchapters.\u201d After signing on as the star and an executive producer, Blanchett became heavily involved in each step of the production. But, much like the audience, the actor found herself being confronted with her \u201cown immediate judgments of characters\u2019 motivations.\u201d\n\u201cAlfonso was really engaged in the fact that there\u2019s this war at the moment \u2014 and it does feel like a battle, actually \u2014 for a singular truth, which I think is a really dangerous and rather pointless exercise, because truth is such a complex thing,\u201d Blanchett says. \u201cWe all know it\u2019s made up of so many different perspectives, and the ones that we lean into are often the most pre-digested, pre-masticated ones that are really easy to swallow and somehow make us feel like we\u2019re good people and the guardians of all knowledge and morality. We don\u2019t like those truths that make us feel uncomfortable about ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cDisclaimer\u201d specifically forces viewers to confront their own biases and the cultural vilification of so-called \u201cbad\u201d women. \u201cI think if you go back and watch it a second time, there\u2019s a crude picture of Catherine that the people were assembling for themselves that didn\u2019t have a lot to do with who she was or what she did, or the impact that she was having in the room,\u201d says Blanchett.\nThe truth was hiding in plain sight. For the first six episodes, viewers were led to believe that Catherine, while vacationing in Italy years earlier, had initiated a self-absorbed affair with a 19-year-old stranger named Jonathan (Louis Partridge), who ultimately died after saving Catherine\u2019s young son from drowning in the ocean.\nIn the finale, Catherine finally confronts Jonathan\u2019s father, Stephen (Kevin Kline), whose late wife, Nancy (Lesley Manville), had written the novel based on a false perception of her son\u2019s final days. But what really happened was that the night before his death, Jonathan had broken into Catherine\u2019s hotel room, forced her to pose for nude photographs, and then violently sexually assaulted her.\n\u201cI think to know that you were moving through and unpicking an audience\u2019s often intractable judgments of what had gone on was a profound relief,\u201d says Blanchett, who recalls feeling markedly lighter after shooting that extended, 40-page monologue all in one take.\nThe devastating final twist was a secret that Blanchett fought to keep, even if it made press next to impossible. \u201cThere are many tangential conversations I would\u2019ve loved to have had about what happens when you sit with abuse, and the various different ways that people bury this [trauma],\u201d she says. \u201cThe courage that it takes still in this day and age to stand up and say it, even after you\u2019ve been sitting on that shame, and the attendant shame that comes for people who are victims of abuse \u2014 I feel like it would\u2019ve been great to use the series in a way as a launchpad to talk about that stuff. You can\u2019t make that stuff happen, but I\u2019ve had quite a few people stop me in the proverbial supermarket to talk about that.\u201d\nWhile she is most renowned for headlining films, Blanchett says she is \u201cabsolutely\u201d looking to venture further into television. In 2020, she earned her first two Emmy nominations for FX\u2019s \u201cMrs. America,\u201d as both an actor and producer. Having always been actively involved in the development of a show, she is now \u201cparticularly keen\u201d to join a series \u201cthat is fully formed.\u201d\nBlanchett may get her wish sooner rather than later. Last year, she filmed a top-secret cameo for the final scene of Netflix\u2019s \u201cSquid Game,\u201d in which she played an unnamed American recruiter who the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) acknowledges and sees playing ddakji with a homeless man in a back alley. The offer \u201ccame out of the blue,\u201d and Blanchett was given little context.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s such a cult series and they were shooting in L.A. of all places, everyone was on a need-to-know basis,\u201d she recalls. She didn\u2019t even do a costume fitting; the production asked her to bring her own suit. \u201cI got a couple of storyboards. I had to [learn to] play the game very quickly. I had to practice and practice. I knew there were four or five setups that they were going to do, and I knew what they needed from every shot, and then I was given the sides. But it was one of the more mysterious jobs.\u201d\nThe surprise casting of a movie star of Blanchett\u2019s caliber suggests that Netflix is exploring new ways to keep the IP alive. Does this mean she is open to leading a potential English-language spinoff or sequel to \u201cSquid Game\u201d?\n\u201cI am wildly open to anything,\u201d Blanchett says, leaning back in her chair with a smirk. \u201cAnd in a world that is so beautifully, magically created like that, for sure. They\u2019re amazing world-builders, and that series has been eaten alive. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a corner of the globe that it hasn\u2019t touched in some way.\u201d\nWhile there has been speculation that David Fincher, Blanchett\u2019s \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button\u201d director, has pitched an English-language series set in the \u201cSquid Game\u201d universe, Blanchett doesn\u2019t have an answer. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d love to work with David again. It\u2019s been ages. But no, I don\u2019t know anything more than you do. I\u2019m not being coy. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\nThroughout her career, Blanchett insists she has always been more interested in choosing her various collaborators than playing a specific kind of character, and \u201cDisclaimer\u201d was no different. \u201cI guess that\u2019s why I\u2019ve played characters big and small in lots of different genres,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more access to different audiences that I am really interested in, because you catch an audience on a different rhythm when they\u2019re at home watching something, or when they\u2019re on the train watching something on a smaller screen, or when they\u2019ve come to the theater. In the end, what I seek is that different connection with them.\u201d"

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?

Before even more new series are announced, here\u2019s our guide of when to expect all the new Star Trek shows, as well as returning familiar favorites, and what else is in the works right now. Engage!\nThis post was last updated 7/14/23.\nCurrently Airing: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2\nThe Enterprise is back after a successful first season, and this time Captain Kirk will be along for the ride with another appearance by Paul Wesley after his surprise finale role in season one. Not much else is known about the season so far, other than one episode will see the show crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks in a live-action/animated hybrid directed by The Next Generation\u2019s Jonathan Frakes. The show has also been renewed for a third season.\nSeason two recaps:\n\u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\u201d\n\u201cCharades\u201d\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 4\nThe third season of the animated series following the misfit crew of the USS Cerritos\u2014and in particular its cadre of ensigns, Mariner (Tawny Newsome), Boimler (Jack Quaid), Tendi (No\u00ebl Wells), and Rutherford (Eugene Cordero)\u2014once again followed our heroic ensigns and the remaining bridge officers aboard the Cerritos. Season four will be arriving in late summer. The show has also been renewed for a fifth season.\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Discovery Season 5\nExpected in early 2024, Discovery\u2019s fifth season will be 10 episodes long, down from the 13 of prior seasons. In the wake of season four\u2018s climax earlier this year, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) led her crew in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from a mysterious anomaly created by an extra-galactic race, ensuring peace and stability for the Federation once more\u2026 for now. As her romantic partner Book (David Ajala) pays time for his own role in a campaign to surreptitiously destroy that anomaly, we\u2019re not sure what awaits Burnham and Discovery\u2019s crew just yet, but given this show, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll be very, very dramatic.\nIn Flux: Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2\nThe animated series aimed at younger Trek fans (and Janeway fans!) and kids at heart can be found on both Nickelodeon and Paramount+. The first season was divided into two parts, with part two wrapping up at the end of 2022; after Paramount+ announced it would not move forward with the show\u2019s already greenlit season two, it was removed from the service. (A home release of the complete first season is still possible; the first 10 episodes are still available for purchase.) Fans are still waiting to hear if Prodigy season two will surface on a different outlet.\nUpcoming: Starfleet Academy\nIt\u2019s really happening! After a long tease, filming on this series will begin in 2024. Here\u2019s the official announcement from co-showrunners and executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau:\n\u201cAdmission is now open to Starfleet Academy! Explore the galaxy!

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Squid Game\u2019s first season dropped seemingly out of the sky in 2021, spanning nine episodes and giving Netflix its biggest hit to date, winning Emmys for creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, star Lee Jung-jae, and others. Season two arrived in late 2024 with seven episodes, picking up three years after the events of season one. Six months later, season three is here; it has just six episodes and begins immediately after the season two cliffhanger.\nIt\u2019s tempting to wish Netflix had just released all of season two and three as a single chunk\u2014six months is enough time to almost forget certain plot points, but not long enough to make viewers want to do a full revisit\u2014but you can see why the decision was made. Though its episode count is abbreviated, Squid Game\u2019s third and final season is still six-ish hours long, and the amount of agony and brutality infused into that running time cannot be overstated.\nMuch of that agony and brutality, of course, comes as a direct result of the events of season two, especially as season three gets started. Player 456, Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), is the only survivor of the rebellion besides 388 (Kang Ha-neul)\u2014who had a meltdown while retrieving more ammunition\u2014and 120 (Park Sung-hoon), who went after him to see what was taking so long. Player 001 (Lee Byung-hun) is presumed dead, though we of course know he\u2019s merely returned to being the Front Man full-time.\nPlayer 456 is baffled as to how he\u2019s still breathing. He\u2019s also nearly paralyzed with a confusing blend of survivor\u2019s guilt and a laser-beam determination to make 388 pay for his failings. But the other players take his miraculous return surprisingly in stride. Most of them are far more focused on the prize money, which has increased exponentially as a result of the player brawl and subsequent rebellion. Those events have also given the \u201cO\u201d side a significant advantage over the \u201cX\u201d side, meaning the next vote will favor continuing the games despite all the recent bloodshed.\nThis is a non-spoiler review, so we won\u2019t be getting into the specific games introduced in season three\u2014though a variation on jump-roping was previously revealed\u2014but rest assured they follow the classic Squid Game formula of childhood favorites expanded into elaborate set pieces, then blended with shocking violence. This season in particular leans into player-on-player attacks, to the point that they\u2019re actively incorporated into the competitions. The results are gory and either heartbreaking or satisfying, depending on if the victim is likable or obnoxious.\nBut this is Squid Game; the whole point is \u201cwin or die.\u201d Viewers already know that a majority of the players, even the ones who actually seem like good people, will not make it to the end. Again, we won\u2019t spoil any specifics here\u2014part of the fun of the show is thinking someone\u2019s safe, only to be gruesomely proven otherwise\u2014but certain deaths do make you wish, again, that seasons two and three had been combined into one. It would make the investment into individual players feel more rewarding, especially those who die early in this season but later in the actual cycle of games.\nOf course, that issue could be remedied by watching season two immediately ahead of season three\u2014if you have the time. That approach might also help you dive more easily into the side plot involving No-eul (Park Gyu-young), the North Korean military vet turned pink guard. Remember the sick little girl she befriended while working at the amusement park at the start of season two? And whose father popped up in the games as Player 246? It all becomes very important in her season three arc, which also features No-eul\u2019s own bloody rebellion of sorts.\nMeanwhile, Squid Game\u2019s other big side plot\u2014that team of mercenaries led by detective Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) frantically searching for the island where the games take place\u2014finally justifies all the time it took up in season two. The audience knows the boat captain is secretly sabotaging the mission, but the show builds up the reveal to Jun-ho and company with some unexpected twists and, much like the games themselves, a ticking-clock element that ratchets the tension to sky-high levels.\nOther elements that come into play in a big way in season three: the masked \u201cVIPs,\u201d who make a return to spectate the games and offer cruel commentary in the form of hilariously terrible English dialogue. There\u2019s so much of the latter this time around, you have to imagine Squid Game\u2019s creators are leaning into how cringe-inducing it is.\nThe cross necklace belonging to the not-so-dearly departed Thanos finds new importance as other players consume the hidden stash of drugs he left behind. And it\u2019s no secret that Player 222 (Jo Yu-ri) was extremely pregnant in season two. Netflix\u2019s marketing for this final installment even included the sound of a baby crying\u2014and unsurprisingly, the situation swirling around 222 shapes season three\u2019s most emotional moments.\nBut the center of Squid Game\u2019s universe has always been Gi-hun, and that remains the case throughout season three. Even though there are episodes where he barely has any dialogue, Lee\u2019s performance speaks volumes: his haunted expression, particularly the look in his eyes, telegraphs the depths of his pain. He was already grappling with having witnessed so many deaths in the previous game\u2014and the cycle continues here. The audience still can\u2019t help but root for him, but in season three you also worry for him. His soul is clearly broken beyond repair.\nGi-hun\u2019s suffering anchors Squid Game season three in a deeply bleak place; there are far fewer lighthearted moments to be found, and that may be challenging for some viewers. But in the end, the story does figure out how to punctuate this vicious final chapter in a memorable, very terminal way. You\u2019re allowed, however, to roll your eyes at what feels very much like a tacked-on Netflix tease for more to come.\nSquid Game season 3 is now streaming on Netflix.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Before a recent interview with the Radio Times promoting Wallace Shawn\u2019s BBC radio drama, The Fever, Cate Blanchett hesitated to introduce herself as an \u201cactress,\u201d because, in her own words, she\u2019s decided to \u201cgive up\u201d acting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m giving up,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting. [There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.\u201d\nFair enough! The two-time Oscar-winning actress has remained an A-lister since her breakout performance in 1998\u2019s Elizabeth. Though she\u2019s likely best known around here for her performance as the Elven queen Galadriel in Peter Jackson\u2019s The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, her numerous genre credits include Sam Raimi\u2019s The Gift, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Thor: Ragnarok, How to Train Your Dragon 2, Don\u2019t Look Up, and The House With the Clock in Its Walls\u2014not to mention her voiceover work in Sweet Tooth, Ponyo, Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio, and many more.\nIn just the past year, the actress played an alien bounty hunter in the (reportedly) disastrous Borderlands adaptation (I still haven\u2019t seen it\u2026), matched wits with bog mummies as the Chancellor of Germany in Guy Maddin\u2019s horror-comedy Rumours, and can currently be seen in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s spy-thriller Black Bag. She\u2019s also about to play an alien posing as a 1950s biker in the upcoming sci-fi/comedy, Alpha Gang. After that, what else is there for an actor to do, really?\nLater in the interview, Blanchett went on to reveal numerous unhinged factoids about herself, including that she\u2019s \u201cobsessed with the psychological space that is the interior of people\u2019s cars,\u201d and loves to take cold showers. Better still, she compares acting to the \u201csonic sweep\u201d of a submarine, though ultimately admits \u201cartists who create works of art that inspire sympathy and good values don\u2019t change the life of the poor.\u201d Again, fair enough.\nLuckily, Blanchett is also a noted activist and Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, so we know she\u2019ll be busy offscreen, at least. What do you think, Blanchemaniacs? Do you wish her well on all her future endeavors, or do you believe her best work is still ahead of her? Sound off in the comments.\nWant more io9 news?

In December, we got a very, very brief tease of season two.\nEcho\nRelease date: November 29, 2023 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from the Hawkeye series will follow Echo, a deaf martial artist, as played by actress Alaqua Cox. Devery Jacobs (Reservation Dogs) co-stars. Echo officially began filming on May 24, according to a tweet by series creator Marion Dayre.

X-Men \u201897 is a revival of the classic \u201890s animated show, bringing back the same style, stories and yes, theme song, of the iconic series. (See more: X-Men \u201897 Looks Like a Nostalgic Blast From the Past)\nIronheart\nRelease date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nWith Tony Stark gone, the MCU needs a new super-genius inventor. Enter teenage prodigy Riri Williams (played by Dominique Thorne), who creates a brand new, ultra-advanced armored suit. Other cast members include Anthony Ramos (In the Heights) as the villain the Hood and Lyric Ross (This Is Us). Chinaka Hodge (TNT\u2019s Snowpiercer) is attached as the head writer, and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler is an executive producer alongside Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and others.

Joe Locke (Heartstopper) and Aubrey Plaza (Hahn\u2019s Parks and Recreation co-star, among her other many credits) are also in the cast, as is Patti LuPone. (A second WandaVision spin-off, this one focusing on Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision, is also reportedly in the works.)\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease date: August 26, 2024 (in Theaters)\nWe\u2019ve got a new Captain America, so it was inevitable that we\u2019d be getting a new Cap movie. Anthony Mackie will appear in the title role. Harrison Ford was announced to take over the role of General Thaddeus Ross and will make his debut in this release.\nDaredevil: Born Again\nRelease date: Spring 2024 (On Disney+)\nCharlie Cox and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio will return as Daredevil and Kingpin for an 18-episode Disney+ series.

Things remain uncertain for Foggy and Karen.\nThunderbolts\nRelease date: December 20, 2024 (In theaters)\nMarvel Studios is readying a movie based on the comic Thunderbolts and director Jake Schreier has been tapped to bring it to life. This film marks the end of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Steven Yeun (Nope) signed on for an undisclosed role\nBlade\nRelease date: February 14, 2025 (In theaters)\nDisney hasn\u2019t revealed much about this reboot of the franchise that features a badass vampire-hunter who is also a vampire, but we know that it stars two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who also played Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes in Netflix Marvel series Luke Cage. We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals. After losing director Bassam Tariq, who would have been the first U.S.-Pakistani person to helm a Marvel Studios film, Blade was put on pause, and its release date was shifted. But now it has a new director in place: Lovecraft Country\u2019s Yann Demange, as well as a writer in Michael Starrbury, so the September 2024 date looks ever more likely.\nDeadpool 3\nRelease date: May 3, 2024 (In Theaters)\nRyan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmerc with the mouth\u201d is set to appear in Disney\u2019s first R-rated film following the company\u2019s completed acquisition of Fox assets. Oh, and did you happen to hear that Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine is also appearing in this one? Unless you are cut off from all social media, you no doubt caught that announcement.\nDeadpool 3 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick spoke with Den of Geek about how Deadpool\u2019s move to the MCU will not affect the feel of the movie. Or, in Wernick\u2019s words: \u201cDeadpool\u2019s gonna be Deadpool.\u201d Reese also said that Disney has been more than willing to ensuring the franchise keeps its core identity. Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back. The first is The Kang Dynasty, a title which heavily suggests that Kang (Jonathan Majors) will play a major role. Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) will direct.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027 (In theaters)\nIt all comes down to this. Phase Six, and the whole Phase 4-6 arc of the Multiverse Saga, ends with Secret Wars. We don\u2019t know anything about the plot other than the comics that the title is based on; Marvel veteran Michael Waldron (Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) is writing the script.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nThis project\u2014originally slated for a Disney+ series, but now getting the feature film treatment\u2014will follow James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as he tracks down stolen tech that allows criminals to replicate Iron Man technology.\nAlso: Marvel slotted several other projects for Phase Six that take place alongside Fantastic Four and the Avengers films. There are two in fall 2024, two in winter 2024, one in winter 2025, two in spring 2025 and two in summer 2025. Some of those are probably\u2026\nUnscheduled But Probably Still Happening Shows & Movies\nMoon Knight Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMoon Knight himself, Oscar Isaac, was recently spotted in Egypt and teased that a second season of his show could be on the way. Marvel and Disney have yet to confirm.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThis new animated show is loosely spun out from a breakout episode of What If? that saw MCU heroes battling a zombie apocalypse.\nSpider-Man: Freshman Year\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nDisney says this new animated series follows Peter Parker \u201con his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we\u2019ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character\u2019s early comic book roots.\u201d\nWhat if\u2026? Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThe speculative animated series and its omnipresent narrator the Watcher will return with an all-new season. The show\u2019s creators say next season will focus on new stories, new heroes, and \u201clots of fun.\u201d Though the trailer still hasn\u2019t been released, the Marvel Animation Panel at San Diego Comic Con revealed some Phase 4 characters that will be in the show.\nUntitled Wakanda Series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nNot much is known yet about this show set in Black Panther\u2019s home country.\nUntitled Shang-Chi sequel\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nShang-Chi\u2019s debut movie was compelling, exciting and fun. It also made a ton of money, so a sequel is inevitable. That the film\u2019s director is making Avengers: The Kang Dynasty does throw it into limbo a bit.\nUntitled Wonder Man series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMarvel Studios has announced that it\u2019s moving ahead with a Wonder Man series. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton is attached to helm and Brooklyn 99 writer Andrew Guest (who also produced Hawkeye) is on board to showrun the series. On October 31, the title star was announced: genre favorite Yayha Abdul-Mateen II.\nUntitled mutants movie\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nNow that Disney owns the old Fox assets that included all the \u201cmutant\u201d Marvel superheroes, you can very likely count on characters like the X-Men making an MCU debut.\nWant more io9 news?
