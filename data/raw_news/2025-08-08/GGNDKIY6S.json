  "content": "Remember when 16GB felt like an ocean of storage on the original iPhone? Those were simpler times. Apple initially offered the OG device in storage capacities of 4GB and 8GB, but just months after launching, Apple nixed the 4GB model, eventually replacing it with a 16GB option. Fast forward to 2025, and Apple offers 128GB as the base storage tier for most iPhone 16 models. That might sound like a lot by comparison, but it's becoming genuinely problematic for users caught in an increasingly aggressive AI storage squeeze.\n\n\n\nIndeed, with the release of iOS 18.3, this AI storage creep was brought into sharp focus. Apple Intelligence, the company's enabled-by-default suite of AI features, now requires a whopping 7GB of storage space \u2013 and that's just the beginning. With Apple promising enhanced Siri capabilities with iOS 26, these storage requirements are only going to grow.\n\nFor perspective, iOS 18 now takes nearly 6% of a 128GB iPhone's total storage capacity and dedicates it to AI features that the user may not even use. And that's before they've even taken their first photo or downloaded their first app. Speaking of photos, a standard iPhone 16 can capture 48MP images and shoot 4K Dolby Vision video at 60fps, which can quickly devour storage, as many users will attest. If it's an iPhone 16 Pro Max, the advanced camera capabilities are even more demanding of solid-state space.\n\nIn fairness, Apple has acknowledged the need for more storage in its top-tier iPhone 16 Pro Max, which starts at 256GB. Apple first nixed the 128GB storage tier for its largest device when the iPhone 15 Pro Max was released in 2023. This suggests the company understands that storage demands are increasing, making its decision to stick this long with 128GB for other models all the more perplexing.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple's continued offering of just 5GB of free iCloud storage simply adds insult to injury. Believe it or not, that figure hasn't changed since iCloud's introduction in 2011. Most would agree it's a measly amount that forces many users to either pay for additional cloud storage or constantly manage their local storage.\n\nThe technology industry has evolved significantly since 128GB became a standard storage tier. Component prices have decreased, while storage demands have skyrocketed, and AI features are only going to get more prevalent. Just as Apple made 16GB the new baseline for MacBook memory in 2024 (a move also likely made due to Apple Intelligence's RAM requirements), it's time for the company to make a similar leap with iPhone storage. Such a move would be far from unprecedented \u2013 remember the 4GB iPhone?\n\nIn the year 2025, 128GB is the new 4GB. Users deserve better than paying $100-500 extra just to avoid the storage anxiety that comes with downloading a bigger (but not necessarily better) software update. These days, 128GB isn't just tight \u2014 it's becoming untenable. So please Apple, make 256GB the new minimum, starting with the iPhone 17 lineup.",

      "text": "Apple this week released iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3, software updates that enable Apple Intelligence on supported devices by default. Whether you own an iPhone, iPad, Mac \u2013 or indeed all three \u2013 regardless of what you think about Apple Intelligence, there's one reason why you may want to disable Apple's AI features at the earliest opportunity: To reclaim storage.\nApple's marketing machine has made much of Apple Intelligence since its announcement at WWDC in June 2024. Apple brought the first features to compatible iPhones, iPads and Macs in October with a point update to iOS 18/iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, followed by a further update in December that brought a more fleshed-out set of AI-powered features, with the most recent update adding some much-needed refinements.\nDespite the raft of updates, Apple Intelligence remains in beta, and in terms of the AI suite's current usefulness, opinions remain decidedly mixed. For some, however, when considering the relative worth of these features, the deciding factor will be their local storage overhead. According to Apple's support page, Apple Intelligence now requires 7GB of storage space. This number applies whether you're using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\nThat might sound like a lot, but it's one way that Apple is able to tout the privacy credentials of Apple Intelligence. Many of these features run locally, and in order to do so, they must download AI models to your device(s), which currently requires 7GB of storage. This means if you have an iPhone, iPad, and a Mac, it effectively equates to 21GB of storage across your devices that is being taken up by AI models that you may never even use.\nBut don't assume that 7GB is any sort of hard cap. In April, Apple is expected to release iOS 18.4 featuring some broad enhancements to Siri's AI capabilities, which will likely hike the storage requirement further. And that's not even taking into consideration the storage demands that iOS 19 will bring later this year...\nAI or No AI? Time to Decide\nHere's the deal. After updating to iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, or macOS Sequoia 15.3, Apple Intelligence is an opt-out feature, not an opt-in feature. In other words, if you have updated \u2013 or plan to update \u2013 your devices to the new software, Apple Intelligence will be automatically enabled upon doing so.\nNote that this still applies if you already disabled it in the previous point updates but then allowed the latest update welcome screens to steer you towards enabling Apple Intelligence again. If however you chose \"Set Up Later\" at the on-screen prompt, you have no action to take \u2013 these features will respect your prior decision and remain disabled. For everyone else, it's time to decide: Is Apple Intelligence really worth all those precious gigabytes?\nWhy Disabling Apple Intelligence Reclaims Storage\nApple Intelligence utilizes something called the MobileAsset framework to manage and deliver its machine learning models and related assets to your devices. This framework dynamically downloads and updates the necessary components, ensuring that your devices have access to the latest capabilities without requiring comprehensive system updates.\nThankfully, when you disable Apple Intelligence, the system identifies that the associated assets are no longer in use. The MobileAsset framework then purges these unused assets when additional space is required \u2013 optimizing and freeing up your local storage in the process. Here are the steps you need to take to ensure that happens.\nHow to Disable Apple Intelligence\nDisabling Apple Intelligence completely is simply a matter of flipping the associated switch on each supported device running the latest software. Compatible devices include any iPhone 16 model, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, any iPad with A17 Pro or M1 and later, and any Mac with M1 or later.\nDisable Apple Intelligence on iPhone and iPad\nOn iPhone and iPad, you can find it in Settings \u279d Apple Intelligence & Siri. Toggle off the switch next to Apple Intelligence.\nDisable Apple Intelligence on Mac\nOn Mac, open System Settings, select Apple Intelligence & Siri in the sidebar, then click the switch next to Apple Intelligence at the top of the menu window to toggle it off.\nWhat You Lose by Disabling Apple Intelligence\nIn iOS 18.2 or later, iPadOS 18.2 or later, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 or later, turning off Apple Intelligence will knock out the following features:\n- Genmoji\n- Image Playground\n- Image Wand in the Apple Pencil tool palette\n- Writing Tools\n- Clean Up in Photos\n- Create a Memory movie in Photos (not available in macOS)\n- Natural language search in Photos\n- Notification summaries\n- Reduce Interruptions Focus\n- Intelligent Breakthrough & Silencing in Focus\n- Priority messages in Mail\n- Smart Reply in Mail and Messages\n- Summaries in Mail and Messages\n- Siri enhancements, including product knowledge, more resilient request handling, new look and feel, more natural voice, the ability to type to Siri, and more\n- ChatGPT integration within Siri and Writing Tools\nIf you don't see any of the features listed above on your device, your specific model likely doesn't support Apple Intelligence, so you don't have anything to worry about."

      "text": "If your iPhone or iPad is full, there are several things you can do to claw back storage space. In this guide, we run through several options and methods available to free up storage on Apple's iOS and iPadOS devices. Keep reading to learn what they are.\nEvery new iPhone and iPad model comes with a set storage capacity ranging from 64GB to 1TB for iPhones, and 64GB to 2TB for iPads. While it's always a good idea to buy a model with the biggest storage you can afford, depending on your usage sometimes even the highest storage devices can fill up, and it can happen when you least expect it.\nFrom the music you buy and the apps you download, to the video you shoot and the messages you receive, all of that content has to live somewhere, either on your device or in cloud storage. When your iPhone or iPad storage is full, it's not like you can increase it. What you can do, however, is free up your existing storage. Here's how.\nBasic Storage-Saving Tips\nApple is aware that many people struggle to manage storage on their devices, which is why it has introduced more and more tools with successive versions of iOS to help users keep on top of the kinds of apps and media that often eat up precious megabytes.\nLaunch the Settings app and select General \u279d iPhone/iPad Storage, and the amount of storage space you've used is shown in the color-coded bar at the top. Below it, you may see a list of recommendations for optimizing storage, by reviewing and deleting large attachments, for example.\nThese recommendations are followed by a list of installed apps and the amount of storage each one uses. The list also tells you when you last used each app, allowing you to easily find and delete the apps that you haven't used for a while or not at all.\nWhen you delete an app, its icon, app data, and any user-generated data is removed. That's fine if you don't intend to use the app again, however Apple also lets you offload apps, which frees up storage space, but leaves the app's icon and user data in place. If an app you use a lot is taking up a lot of space, it's worth checking if you can clear any cache associated with it.\nAnother option that Apple added to iOS/iPadOS not so long ago is the ability to prevent your iPhone or iPad from from automatically installing software updates. It used to be the case that new software updates were downloaded automatically in the background and then installed through an Automatic Updates feature. However, these days the Settings app includes a toggle that lets you choose whether updates are automatically downloaded or not.\n- How to Remove the Apps You Don't Use on Your iPhone and iPad\n- How to Delete Apps on iPhone and iPad\n- Prevent iPhone From Automatically Downloading Software Updates\n- How to Delete Large Attachments on iPhone and iPad\n- How to Clear Cache on iPhone and iPad\nReclaim Space Taken Up By Photos\nThe photos that you keep on your iPhone or iPad naturally take up storage space on your device, which can fill up quickly depending on the available storage capacity and how much content you have.\nIf you see a message that your device's storage is full, it's worth checking out a system option called Optimize Storage, which is designed to work with iCloud Photos. This feature replaces full-resolution photos on your Apple device with smaller, device-sized versions that take up a lot less storage space, while the full-resolution images remain off-device in iCloud.\nAnother way of pruning your photo library is checking for redundant shots taken in Burst Mode. Burst Mode refers to when the camera on your device captures a series of photos in rapid succession, at a rate of ten frames per second.\nIt's a great way to shoot an action scene or an unexpected event, since you're always more likely to end up with the picture you were aiming for. But it also generates a lot of unwanted images, so it's good practice to pick out the best image for safe keeping, and delete the rest to save on storage space.\nIf you have an older iPhone, you can also save space when shooting in HDR. On iPhone X and earlier models, when the camera takes an automatic HDR photo, it can also optionally keep the standard shot in your Photo library, which is useful for comparison or for when the HDR picture doesn't come out as expected. However, if you want, you can disable this function and thereby save yourself some storage space.\nIn some cases, you can find your photo library getting bigger even when you haven't been taking pictures on your device. For example, the media that people share with you over WhatsApp may be automatically saved to your iPhone's Photos app. Fortunately, you can easily prevent this default behavior by disabling Save to Photos in WhatsApp's in-app settings.\nOf course, if your photo library feels like it's ballooned out of control, one solution is to start afresh and delete all the photos on your iPhone. Just make sure you've already backed any up that you want to keep, and be aware that deleting your photos with iCloud Photo Library enabled will delete your photos from ALL of your devices.\n- How to Optimize Photos to Take Up Less Storage Space on iPhone and iPad\n- How to Delete All Photos From Your iPhone or iPad\n- How to Discard Normal Photos When Shooting in HDR\n- How to Delete Redundant Burst Mode Photos on iPhone and iPad\n- Stop WhatsApp Auto-Saving Media to iPhone Photos App\nReclaim Space Taken Up By Videos\nSome of the above photo tips apply to videos stored in your device's photo library. However, there are other ways to prevent video content from eating up storage space. For example, you can customize the resolution and frame rate of recorded video to reduce the file size in Settings \u279d Camera \u279d Record Video.\nElsewhere, if you regularly download Apple Fitness+ videos to your iPhone or iPad, check the recommendations in Settings \u279d General \u279d iPhone Storage and you should see them listed under Review Downloaded Videos, where you'll be able to delete them individually or in bulk.\nIf you have an Apple TV+ subscription, or you've rented or purchased movies, you can download videos using Apple's TV app to watch them offline. However, if you're looking to save space, go to Settings \u279d Apps \u279d TV, then under \"Download Options,\" make sure that you've selected Fast Downloads \u2013 this results in lower quality videos, but they use less storage.\n- How to Delete Downloaded Videos on iPhone and iPad\n- How to Adjust TV App Video Download Settings on iPhone and iPad\n- How to Save Storage Space When Recording Video on iPhone and iPad\nReclaim Space Taken By Other Apps/Media\nWhatsApp features a built-in media management tool that can help you identify, select, and bulk delete GIFs, photos, and videos that may be filling up your phone.\nThe tool groups together large files and media that has been forwarded many times, sorting files by size in descending order, and provides a way to preview files before deleting them. You can also see a preview of media before selecting one or multiple files to delete. To access the storage management tool, launch the app and go to Settings \u279d Storage and Data \u279d Manage Storage.\nIf you're an Apple Music subscriber, you can download songs, playlists, and albums from the Apple Music catalog to your iPhone or iPad for offline listening, but this can gradually eat up your device's storage space over time.\nFortunately the Music app includes a handy feature that can spring into action whenever your device's storage space runs low, and automatically offload songs you haven't played for a while in order to make space for newer ones.\nCheck Settings \u279d Apps \u279d Music \u279d Optimize Storage, and make sure the Optimize Storage switch is enabled. From here, you can also choose a minimum storage amount that you want to keep for music before downloaded songs start being removed from your device. You can also monitor storage space by turning off automatic downloads in Settings \u279d Apps \u279d Music and downloading new songs manually when needed.\nOf course, Apple Music users can also remove songs and whole albums in the Music app. Simply press and hold an item, select Delete From Library from the pop-up menu, and then tap Delete Album/Song when prompted.\nThere are several ways to trim fat from the Messages app. For example, iOS can be automated to discard old messages that have been on your device for longer than a specific period of time.\nIn addition, if you tap the contact bubble(s) and at the top of a Messages conversation, you can also see every file that has been sent to you in the chat thread in one easily accessible location, where you can remove them all in one fell swoop.\nOther Apple apps that are worth checking include the Books app and the Voice Memos app. If you listen to a lot of audiobooks, try nixing your back catalog, and review any old Voice Memo recordings to see if you need them any more.\n- How to Review and Delete WhatsApp Media\n- How to Limit the Space Apple Music Takes Up on Your iPhone\n- How to Remove Downloaded Apple Music Songs to Free Up Storage Space\n- How to Auto-Delete Old Message Conversations on iPhone and iPad\n- How to Delete Messages Attachments on iPhone and iPad\n- How to Delete Downloaded Books and Audiobooks From iPhone and iPad\n- How to Delete Voice Memo Recordings on iPhone and iPad\nWrapping Up\nWe've run through the main storage-saving tips for iPhone and iPad, but depending on your use case, there may be other ways that you can free up space on your device. For instance, if you do a lot of on-device file management in the Files app, consider compressing large files and folders by selecting Compress from the contextual pop-up menu.\nIf you're still short on space and you've exhausted all the above options, it may be worthwhile resorting to the \"nuke\" option \u2013 a clean install \u2013 by erasing your device and starting again. If that doesn't help, it could be time to upgrade your device.\nGot any more tips we haven't mentioned here? Let us know in the comments, or Send us an email."

  "argos_summary": "As storage demands for iPhones increase, Apple has shifted its base storage tier from 16GB to 128GB, yet users are facing challenges due to the growing storage requirements of AI features like Apple Intelligence, which now consumes 7GB. With the upcoming iOS updates expected to further increase storage needs, many users are finding 128GB inadequate, especially when considering high-resolution photos and videos. Apple has acknowledged this issue by offering 256GB as the starting storage for its iPhone 15 Pro Max, suggesting a need for a similar upgrade across other models.",
