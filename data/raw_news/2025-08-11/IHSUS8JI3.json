  "content": "Just as the American EV market braces for a potential collapse, Ford is making a shocking pivot. With federal tax credits set to disappear on September 30 and demand expected to plummet, the automaker is doubling down with an additional $2 billion investment in battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). But it\u2019s doing so with a new strategy borrowed not from its American rivals, but directly from China.\n\nThe centerpiece of this bet is a new midsize electric pickup with a targeted base price of just $30,000. CEO Jim Farley announced, on Monday, the unnamed vehicle at an event in Louisville, Kentucky, where it will be assembled, with a planned market arrival in 2027.\n\n\u201cThis new truck, based on this universal platform, is going to be more spacious inside than the RAV4, the best-selling car in the United States,\u201d Farley declared, directly targeting the king of the gasoline SUV market. \u201cBut it will have a frunk and it will have a whole pickup truck bed behind it. No one has seen this kind of flexibility.\u201d\n\nRecent reports suggest the new EV pickup could be a revival of the Ranchero. According to the site Ford Authority, the company has filed a new trademark for the name, specifically for use on electric pickup trucks. The Ranchero, a car-truck hybrid not seen on U.S. roads since 1979, was a cult classic that offered the comfort of a sedan with the utility of a pickup bed.\n\nThis move marks a radical departure for Ford. It\u2019s a break from its American competitors, notably Tesla, which has focused on premium vehicles like the commercially struggling Cybertruck. It\u2019s also a break from Ford\u2019s own profitable strategy of selling large, expensive pickups and SUVs like the F-150 and Expedition.\n\nInstead, Ford is adopting a strategy that looks much more like that of Chinese automaker BYD, which has become the world\u2019s largest EV seller by specializing in affordable electric cars. The cheapest BYD EV, the Seagull, starts at the equivalent of just $9,700 in China. This focus on affordability has allowed BYD to steal massive market share from Tesla in both China and Europe.\n\nFarley acknowledged that many current EVs don\u2019t address what buyers actually want. \u201cA computer can have much lower costs\u2014that\u2019s why we redid this platform\u2026 to bring the costs down,\u201d he told CNBC.\n\nSo how does Ford plan to build a low-cost, high-performance pickup that no other American automaker has managed? By completely reinventing its design and manufacturing process. A secret \u201cskunkworks\u201d team created, the carmaker said, the new \u201cFord Universal EV Platform,\u201d a simplified architecture using 20% fewer parts and 25% fewer fasteners. The wiring harness alone is 4,000 feet shorter.\n\nThe battery is another key. Ford is manufacturing its own cobalt-free LFP prismatic batteries in Michigan. This chemistry is, Ford claimed, significantly cheaper, and its design allows it to serve as a structural part of the truck\u2019s floor, saving space and cost.\n\nFinally, Ford has reinvented the factory itself. Instead of the traditional moving assembly line, the new truck will be built using an \u201cassembly tree.\u201d The vehicle is built in three main sub-assemblies\u2014the front, the rear, and the structural battery floor with the interior already attached\u2014which are then joined at the end. Ford claims this revolutionary process is 15% faster and considerably simpler.\n\n\u201cOur idea is that the people working here in Louisville will be able to buy this car and spend money on other things they love, like vacations, their home, and their children\u2019s education,\u201d Farley said.\n\nThis new truck is a direct challenge to the entire auto industry. But it comes as Ford\u2019s own EV division is struggling. In the second quarter of 2025, the unit recorded an operating loss of $1.3 billion. The company is betting that this radical new approach, borrowed from China and powered by American innovation, is the only way to finally make EVs profitable for the company and affordable for everyone else.",

      "text": "Ford is promising a revolution. The company plans to make a big announcement on August 11 about its electric vehicle future, an event it is hyping as a \u201cModel T moment.\u201d\nIn a blog post, Ford invoked the spirit of its most iconic creation, the car that \u201cput the world on wheels\u201d by making transportation \u201caccessible to the masses.\u201d The message is clear: Ford believes it is on the verge of launching a breakthrough EV that is both capable and, crucially, affordable. But what is it?\nA new clue, uncovered by the site Ford Authority, suggests that Ford\u2019s futuristic revolution will be powered by a ghost from its past. Just days before its big announcement, Ford has filed a new trademark for the name \u201cRanchero,\u201d specifically for use on \u201cElectric vehicles,\u201d namely \u201cpick-up trucks.\u201d\nFor Ford, this is a familiar playbook. The company has mastered the art of raiding its own archives, using beloved, gas-guzzling names from its history to sell a radically new electric future. They did it with the Mustang Mach-E, weathering a storm of outrage from purists to turn it into a best-selling electric SUV. They did it again with the F-150 Lightning, attaching their most trusted truck name to their flagship EV pickup. And with the Maverick, they revived another classic name to win over a new generation of buyers.\nThe Ranchero trademark filing signals that Ford is about to do it again. But this time, the stakes are even higher. The company is promising \u201cbreakthrough electric vehicles\u201d made in America. According to reports, Ford is developing a low-cost electric platform meant to underpin a range of future models, starting with a midsize pickup. That strategy could give Ford a weapon in the fight for EV affordability, a challenge even Tesla hasn\u2019t fully solved.\nThe Ranchero nameplate hasn\u2019t been seen on U.S. roads since 1979, but its history is unlike anything else in Ford\u2019s lineup. Launched in 1957, the original Ranchero blurred the lines between car and truck, offering the comfort and style of a sedan with the practicality of a pickup bed. It quickly found a following among farmers, tradespeople, and California surfers alike.\nIt competed head-to-head with Chevrolet\u2019s El Camino, part of a wave of so-called \u201ccar-truck hybrids\u201d that traced their lineage back to Australian \u201cutes\u201d of the 1930s, multipurpose vehicles that could haul hay bales in the morning and churchgoers in the afternoon.\nA \u201cModel T Moment\u201d for the EV Age\nFord is clearly leaning into the symbolism. In the blog post, the company\u2019s heritage team invoked the birth of the Model T, the 1908 car that put the world on wheels by making personal transportation accessible to the masses. Born in secrecy on the third floor of Ford\u2019s Piquette Plant, the Model T was designed to be universal: affordable, repairable, and adaptable for everything from climbing Pike\u2019s Peak to serving as a snowmobile. Ford says it wants to recreate that breakthrough, this time with EVs.\n\u201cNow Ford is going back to its roots for another Model T moment,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cFord leaders will share more about our plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America.\u201d\nIf the Ranchero is part of that vision, it could bring back the practicality and personality of the car-pickup hybrid for a new generation. This time powered by electrons, not gasoline. And if history is any guide, the electric version of the Ranchero could bridge the gap between work and play in a market where most EV pickups still aim for size and luxury, not versatility and price."
