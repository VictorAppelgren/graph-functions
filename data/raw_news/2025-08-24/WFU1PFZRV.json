  "title": "Can You Use Makita Batteries On Harbor Freight Tools?",
  "description": "Makita batteries aren\u2019t directly compatible with Harbor Freight tools. Adapters exist, but they may affect performance, safety, and tool warranty.",
  "content": "Can You Use Makita Batteries On Harbor Freight Tools?\n\nLet nobody say that owning and operating a toolbox, whether for personal crafting endeavors or professional contracting work, is cheap. Stocking your cabinet with name-brand tools like Makita is appealing from a functionality perspective, but as with pretty much any other business sector, name brands mean hefty price tags. Just getting a single rechargeable Makita battery pack will set you back $157, and even the cheapest Makita tools aren't exactly bargain bin deals. A helpful solution would be to use that high-quality battery in tandem with simpler, more affordable tools, such as those sold by the various in-house brands of hardware retailer Harbor Freight. Those brands use rechargeable batteries as well, so there must be some manner of connection. Unfortunately, due to legal, economic, and practical factors, Makita's batteries are not natively compatible with any of the brands sold at Harbor Freight. The only possible way to circumvent this limitation would be to use a third-party battery adapter, but putting a chunk of unlicensed hardware between your expensive batteries and tools may cause more problems than it ends up fixing.\n\nMakita's batteries cannot be used with Harbor Freight's brands Harbor Freight has a variety of power tool brands beneath its proverbial banner, including Bauer, Hercules, Warrior, and Atlas. Despite technically being store brands, each of these brands uses its own proprietary connectors and technology for its battery systems and tools. This, unfortunately, means that there is no interconnectivity between these brands, nor any other name-brand power tool system like Makita. The chief culprit behind the lack of compatibility between these systems is the various power terminals and connector rails they use. Every brand's battery uses differently-shaped terminals to deliver power, as well as differently-shaped rails to lock onto a tool's receiver. For example, if you take a look at the top of a Makita 18V 5Ah battery pack, you can see its connector has a deep indentation, with seven small terminals delivering power in tandem. A Bauer battery, meanwhile, has a more traditional comb-shaped top with six notches separating its terminals. If you tried to plug a Makita battery into a Bauer tool, the terminals wouldn't even come close to connecting, and power wouldn't flow. Due to the stark differences between the connecting rails used by the two batteries, it's unlikely you would even be able to properly snap the battery onto the receiver in the first place.\n\nThere are battery adapters, but using them can cause problems There are more than a few power tool users out there who aren't particularly satisfied with the exclusive nature of power tool batteries, whether it's Makita's, Harbor Freight's, or any others. For this reason, there's an entire unofficial sub-industry of third-party companies making adapter devices designed to facilitate a connection between two otherwise incompatible devices, with such devices sold on platforms like Amazon. If you wanted to use a Makita battery with a Bauer power drill, for instance, you could attach a specialized Makita-to-Bauer adapter to fully link the Makita battery with the Bauer tool's receiver. However, all hardware brands are major sticklers when it comes to using genuine branded hardware, and it's not just for legal reasons or to keep you in their systems. Within every rechargeable power tool battery, besides the actual battery part, is a circuit board that helps the battery to deliver its power in a safe, optimal manner. If you attach an adapter to a Makita battery, that circuit board is bypassed to facilitate a power transfer, removing its safety protocols in the process. You'll get power, but it could be either far less power than that Harbor Freight tool needs to function properly, or far too much power, which ends up completely burning out the tool's motor. Using any kind of third-party accessory is considered a violation of Harbor Freight and Makita's warranties, which would normally be one of the major selling points in Makita's case. As such, if your batteries or tools are damaged due to the use of an unlicensed third-party adapter, neither Makita nor Harbor Freight will offer you service or replacements.",

      "text": "13 Of The Cheapest Makita Power Tools You Can Buy In 2025\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThe Makita brand has a long history and has been building a reputation as one of the best power tool brands on the planet for decades. Consumers and professionals worldwide don't need to consider much before investing in the brand because they know it for reliability, performance, and innovation. Even if you're accustomed to the brand, you might not know that there are technologies you'll only find in Makita tools. The brand has become a staple of contractor trucks, jobsite trailers, and garages everywhere. It doesn't matter if it's drilling into concrete or trimming lumber on a remote location, Makita's got it covered.\nThe toolmaker's 18V LXT battery platform is one of the most popular among industry workers and DIYers. Makita 18V batteries are lightweight, but can reach good runtimes, support fast charging, and are compatible with hundreds of tools. Brushless motors, great build quality, and safety-focused electronics are common features of Makita tools, and help get the job done even in the most demanding conditions. What makes the brand even more appealing is that it offers everything from high-end cordless miter saws and demolition hammers to precision grinders and jobsite vacuums.\nExcept, Makita's top-tier offerings can climb well above the $500 mark. However, not everything under its banner requires a major investment. In fact, some of its most underrated tools are also the most affordable. Those are often reliable, stripped-down essentials that deliver Makita quality at a price nearly anyone can budget for.\nXDT18ZB LXT Brushless Cordless Impact Driver\nThe Makita XDT18ZB 18V LXT Brushless Impact Driver is easy to recommend, as it doesn't cross the $100 line (it's usually sold for around $93 as a bare tool). This sub-compact unit offers up to 1,500 in-lb of torque and speeds of 3,600 IPM, all in a lightweight body. It's part of Makita's LXT ecosystem, meaning seamless battery compatibility and proven durability across an entire cordless setup. The brushless motor also boosts the runtime and reduces heat buildup, while the ergonomic grip and dual LED lights make it a pleasure to use in dark or awkward work zones.\nThis tool has a 1/4-inch hex chuck engineered for quick bit changes, and its balanced frame makes it ideal for long fastening jobs, if you want to avoid wrist fatigue. Despite its size, the XDT18ZB doesn't skimp on toughness. Assembling furniture, driving lag bolts, and automotive repairs are all possible with this driver, as it hits a sweet spot of size, speed, and strength.\nXPH14Z LXT Brushless Hammer Drill\nFor serious drilling power without crossing into premium pricing territory, the XPH14Z 18V LXT Brushless Hammer Drill is one of the best choices, and represents some of the best value in Makita's cordless lineup. Priced around $95 as a bare tool, it offers performances that rival more expensive models in the same category. The XPH14Z is built around a brushless motor, and it delivers up to 2,100 RPM and 31,500 BPM, making it a versatile option for everything from standard wood and metal drilling to even masonry jobs.\nThis tool, too, is part of Makita's trusted LXT 18V system, making it compatible with the batteries many professionals and enthusiasts already have in their toolbox. That's a huge plus for anyone already invested in the brand. Ergonomics are excellent with the XPH14Z, too, with a rubberized grip that won't wear down during long jobs and well-balanced weight. While it's sold as a bare tool, meaning it doesn't include the battery and the charger, the XPH14Z is still a great choice for marrying performances and affordability.\nHS7600 7.25-Inch Compact Circular Saw\nMakita's HS7600 7.25-Inch Compact Circular Saw strikes the perfect balance between power and portability, even though it's a corded tool. It packs a 10.5\u2011amp motor that spins up to an impressive 5,200 RPM, giving it enough bite to handle framing, sheathing, and trim cuts. Despite its 7.25-inch blade, it tips the scale at just 8.6 pounds, light enough for overhead work, yet stout enough to deliver clean, straight cuts. What sets it apart is a rugged aluminum wraparound base and a low-guard design that's engineered for precise bevel and narrow cuts.\nThese are the kind of features that professional builders will appreciate. User reviews consistently praise its compact footprint and easy handling, often noting that it feels better balanced than some of its bulkier competitors. For setup and blade changes, Makita integrated a flat motor housing and an onboard wrench, small details that noticeably improve uptime. Whether it's framing walls, installing plywood sheathing, or outfitting a workshop, this tool delivers premium performances without the premium cost. At $123, this is an affordable, dependable workhorse that proves Makita's craftsmanship is still one of the best.\nXFD15ZB LXT Sub-Compact Brushless Driver-Drill\nA compact yet capable drill that doesn't make your budget evaporate? It must be the Makita XFD15ZB Sub-Compact Brushless Driver-Drill. At $113 for a bare tool, this driver-drill just had to be on our list. Despite its small frame, this brushless beast delivers smooth two-speed drilling of up to 1,900 RPM, for powerful performance on a variety of materials. Thanks to its compact, ergonomic design, it can fit in some tight spots and features a rubber grip that balances comfort with control, even during long stretches behind the trigger.\nWhat makes it shine is the brushless motor combined with Makita's LXT 18V battery platform, offering extended runtime and 1,500 in\u2011lb of max torque in a package weighing only 2.9 pounds. That's a serious torque-to-weight ratio that rivals larger drills but won't kill your arms on overhead or ladder work. Its compact size means it slips easily into tight cabinet spaces or between floor joists; Great news for professionals and casual users alike. At its price point, the XFD15ZB is a clear win for anyone building a cordless toolkit with serious versatility.\nXMT03Z LXT Oscillating Multi-Tool\nFor those who like to have one tool that can do almost everything, the Makita XMT03Z 18V LXT Oscillating Multi-Tool is an absolute steal. Often found between $128 and $159, this cordless workhorse is built to handle sanding, plunge cuts, grout removal, scraping, and more, but still comes with the quality and durability Makita is known for. The tool features variable speeds ranging from 6,000 to 20,000 OPM and a 3.2-degree oscillation angle. This gives you smooth, precise performance on fine detail jobs and fast results when powering through tough material. Its ergonomic barrel grip and lock-on power switch, meanwhile, help make it comfortable during extended use.\nWhile it's not the lightest option in the LXT lineup, the XMT03Z is reliable and built like a tank. The tool-less clamp design makes changing accessories fast and easy, and it comes with adapters to fit most major blade systems, giving you maximum flexibility without extra cost. While newer brushless versions exist, the XMT03Z still holds up as a dependable all-purpose option, especially for DIYers and pros looking for a versatile cordless tool. It may not be flashy, but this multi-tool earns its keep the moment you run into a job where nothing else is a good fit.\nJR3051T LXT Recipro Saw\nThe Makita JR3051T Reciprocating Saw is a no-nonsense demolition tool that won't drain your wallet too much, being available at around $149. This is a tool built for demanding tasks, with an 11-amp motor that can cut through wood, metal, PVC, and some heavier materials with ease. A 1-1/8-inch stroke length combined with variable speed control means you can go from surgical precision to full-throttle chaos in just a few seconds. Changing blade is also quick and doesn't require a separate tool, which keeps things moving fast on the jobsite as well as in the garage.\nDespite being corded, the JR3051T is fairly lightweight and well-balanced, making it just as effective for overhead cuts as floor-level demolition. It's got a rubberized handle for added grip and comfort, and its anti-vibration design helps reduce fatigue during extended use. Busting out drywall, pruning thick limbs, or hacking through old plumbing is easy with this saw. It's not stylish, but it gets the job done.\nXDT13Z LXT Brushless Impact Driver\nThe Makita XDT13Z 18V LXT Brushless Impact Driver is one of the best cordless impact drivers by Makita, if nothing else thanks to its affordable price tag. Just like the brand's corded reciprocating saw, this impact driver is sold at $149 for the bare tool alone. What's impressive about it is that, while it stands at a meager five inches, the XDT13Z pumps out 1,500 in-lb of max torque, with up to 3,400 RPM and 3,600 IPM, pushing fasteners with authority without taking much space in the toolbox. Weighing in at just 3.3 pounds when equipped with a battery, it's a small powerhouse that won't wear you down when you're working. It features a robust metal gear housing, a one-touch 1/4-inch hex chuck for lightning-fast bit swaps, and dual LEDs that shine light into dark corners.\nIt's also all wrapped in rubber overmold for a comfortable grip. Plus, Makita's Star Protection electronics kick in to protect it against overload, over-discharge, and overheating during intense sessions. It may not have speed preset modes, but its torque-to-size ratio and ergonomic balance make it a perfect companion for decking, framing, automotive work, or any job where brute fastening meets precision.\nXSS02Z 18V 6.5-Inch Cordless Circular Saw\nThe Makita XSS02Z 18V LXT 6.5-inch Cordless Circular Saw presents a nice balance of power, portability, and price. It's usually sold for $149 as a bare tool, the same as many Makita tools in this price range. It delivers serious cut\u2011through capabilities, thanks to its 6.5-inch carbide blade. This blade can handle plywood, trim, and even light framing without hesitation. It combines Makita's 18V batteries, the LXT line, with a brushless motor, resulting in a product with enough runtime and torque to be comparable to many corded competitors, with all the convenience of a cordless tool.\nWeighing under seven pounds and featuring a soft-grip rear handle, this Makita cordless saw is pleasantly balanced and easy to maneuver on ladders or jobsite scaffolding. The built-in LED job light is small, but does make precise alignment easier, and users say the onboard bevel and depth gauges feel solid. Blade changes are tool-free and quick, too, which saves time. It's not the biggest saw in the shed, but it handles everyday crosscuts and bevels just fine. The noise is notably lower than full-size models, too. At under $150, the XSS02Z is a great pick for a cordless saw.\nXAG04Z LXT Brushless 4.5- and 5-Inch Angle Grinder\nAnother compact yet powerful grinder that won't burn a hole in your wallet is the Makita XAG04Z LXT Brushless 4.5- and 5-inch Angle Grinder. This tool, too, hits the sweet spot between price and quality. It's sold for $169 as a bare tool and carries a brushless motor that delivers enough power to tackle metal grinding, masonry cleaning, and even light concrete work. It spins up to 10,000 RPM, providing smooth cutting and metal removal without bogging down, even when pushing through tough material.\nThe tool's compact design and soft-grip rear handle make it easy to control, whether you're working on a rail frame or a weld seam, and its weight of just over four pounds keeps fatigue at bay for longer sessions. A paddle-type switch also adds a layer of safety in case you drop the grinder, while the geared spiral bevel allows for optimal torque in compact spaces. The spindle lock lets you swap discs in no time, as we've come to expect from the brand. And don't overlook Makita's Star Protection electronics, which helps guard against overheating and over-discharge, an especially helpful addition for extended use.\n5007FA 7.25-Inch Circular Saw\nThe Makita 5007FA 7.25-Inch Circular Saw is a reliable option for most jobs and a solid choice comparable to those sold by the best major power tool brands, while being a little cheaper than those options, typically being sold for $169. Powered by a 15\u2011amp motor and an electric brake, it delivers clean, confident cuts through plywood, framing lumber, and sheet goods, while the lock\u2011on trigger ensures steady, fatigue\u2011friendly operation during long sessions. Weighing in at roughly 10 pounds, it strikes a balance between heft and maneuverability, perfect for both tough on-site tasks and weekend workshop projects.\nThe magnesium shoe and baseplate are durable, while built\u2011in depth and bevel adjustments allow for clean, precise 45-degree cuts and rip work. Ergonomically, the oversized soft\u2011grip rear handle and rubber front grip are meant to help manage vibrations during overhead or angled cuts. Onboard blade and wrench storage make tool changes fast, keeping your workflow smooth. It might not have the featherweight feel of other compact offerings, but if you need more power, the 5007FA delivers.\nXBU03Z LXT Brushless Cordless Blower\nIf you've only ever had corded blowers, the Makita XBU03Z LXT Brushless Cordless Blower is going to be a game-changer, removing the need to wrestle with cords while still providing serious airflow for blowing waste off your yard and removing jobsite debris. It's typically priced around $169 for the tool alone, comparable to most other tools on this list. Harnessing the efficiency of a brushless motor and the convenience of Makita's LXT battery ecosystem, the blower blasts air at up to 350 CFM and reaches speeds of 116 MPH. That's enough to clear leaves, sawdust, and light gravel in seconds. Despite its power, it remains relatively quiet, at just 60dB, and lightweight, clocking in at about four pounds.\nThe balanced weight of the tool and the variable-speed trigger make controlling airflow intuitive, whether it's a gentle sweep or an aggressive blowout. The easy-access air filter also simplifies maintenance, while the angled tube directs air exactly where you need it without needing to bend awkwardly. There's also a rugged polymer housing and a durable brushless motor that prefers batteries to gas. For under $200, the XBU03Z blends cordless freedom, power, and versatility into one package. The only issue is that, when used on max speed, it goes through batteries fairly quickly. That said, this blower is still an ideal pick for homeowners and DIYers, and confirms that Makita is a good brand of leaf blowers.\nXAD01Z LXT 3/8-Inch Right-Angle Drill\nThe Makita XAD01Z LXT 3/8-Inch Right-Angle Drill is a standout tool in this list, even though we're starting to get a little pricier. This right angle drill is typically around $229 as a bare tool, which is expensive, but still better than some top competitors. Plus, the XAD01Z is a real powerhouse that delivers up to 1,050 in\u2011lb of torque and runs at 1,800 RPM, making it more than adequate for threading pipes, drilling studs, and working under cabinets. Its true strength lies in accessibility, though. The 90-degree configuration and slim 10.6\u2011inch body enable you to maneuver into closets, HVAC duct runs, and tight framing cavities where standard drills won't reach. Being lighter than four pounds, with a well-balanced body and a rubberized grip, this tool is comfortable to use even when you have to work in awkward positions.\nIt features a single-sleeve 3/8-inch hex chuck for fast bit changes and built-in LED lights to brighten up dark corners. Plus, Makita's Star Protection electronics guard against overload and overheating, increasing durability. While the XAD01Z isn't cheap, the combination of torque, portability, and build quality make it a good investment for many, especially those who do precision work in challenging environments.\nXT614SX1 Six-Piece Combo Kit\nThe Makita XT614SX1 Six\u2011Piece Combo Kit is incredibly good value. Just look at Milwaukee's seven-tool combo kit, sold for $849, and compare it to this $437 bundle. Makita's kit is absolutely packed with versatile tools, including essential LXT tools like a compact drill, an impact driver, a reciprocating saw, and more. Many of the tools in the bundle feature a brushless motor, rubberized grips, and Star Protection electronics, giving you incredible performances at a price that, outside this bundle, wouldn't even be enough to buy three serious power tools.\nThe drill is compact, the impact driver delivers up to 1,460 in-lb of torque, and the saws are more than capable to rip through wood. There's also an LED light, to keep the workspace illuminated. Everything fits in a carrying case that seems to be quite resilient and well-organized, to keep gear protected and ready to go. This kit features many of Makita's essential tools for new homeowners, and it will probably be enough to satisfy most user for a long time. If you're looking to build a collection of Makita LXT tools, this is a great place to start. The only drawback is the lack of large batteries, since the kit only comes with two LXT 18V/3Ah batteries."

      "text": "10 Tool Brands You Might Not Realize Are Owned By Harbor Freight\nAs a critical outlet for low-cost tools, there's no retailer quite like Harbor Freight. The company offered fantastic bargains to consumers since the beginning of its history in 1977 as Harbor Freight Salvage Company. The business model initially focused on bringing factory production directly to the consumer in an effort to cut out unnecessary costs. Harbor Freight still operates on this premise, with dozens of brands falling under its purview. The company doesn't make any of these products in the classical sense, but it contracts out the building process to other manufacturing facilities and then sells the gear under various brand names corresponding roughly (or specifically) to certain use cases. Daytona equipment, for instance, is a highly focused automotive workshop range that falls under Harbor Freight's umbrella. On the other hand, Icon covers a broad spectrum of applications from hand tools to storage solutions and diagnostic equipment.\nAcross its digital and physical shelves, Harbor Freight carries nearly any type of tool, consumable, or accessory you might need to get the job done. It's a haven for DIYers and pros alike who are looking to find excellent gear at affordable prices. As with any low-cost retailer, there are things to look out for (tips and tricks that Harbor Freight employees probably won't tell you), but overall buyers get what they need at great discounts. These are the brands that make it possible.\nICON\nHarbor Freight's premium hand tool range features the ICON branding that many Harbor Freight regulars will know and love. It was launched in 2018 with torque wrenches featuring as the first product under the moniker. The lineup quickly expanded though, with a resounding customer approval of the brand's gear. ICON now includes a variety of diagnostic tools and other shop essentials, as well as storage options, and even lighting and other shop equipment. Diagnostic scanners from the brand can test for a variety of automotive issues, and the storage solutions offered are fantastic shop floor inclusions that can make organization far less complicated.\nIt's thought that plenty of ICON gear is manufactured by the same source maker for many of Milwaukee's hand tools, though nothing of this sort can be confirmed. Harbor Freight has been tight-lipped thus far about where its ICON products are manufactured, but the hand tool lineup is crafted in Taiwan and the rumor mill suggests it may be Infar Industrial Co. that rolls them out.\nPittsburgh (and Pittsburgh Pro)\nHarbor Freight's hand tool range isn't only focused on premium gear. While the ICON lineup represents many of the retailer's most impressive workshop and mechanic's tools, someone building a first-timer's collection or opting for a beater inclusion might choose from the storefront's other hand-tool ranges. Harbor Freight's Pittsburgh tools lineup includes many of the same hand tools as the ICON range, but they sell at a much lower price point on the whole. Pittsburgh's 53-piece ratchet and fastening set, for instance, can be bought for $20. A basic ICON flex head ratchet bit set (35 pieces) sells for double that.\nThe result is a range of hand tools that are perfect for those hoping to stretch their dollar a lot further. They aren't bemoaned as useless garbage by any stretch, appearing to strike the perfect balance between hearty hand tools that provide consistent effectiveness and cost-saving prices. For an upgrade, however, buyers might consider Pittsburgh Pro for its slightly higher quality and longevity, and prices that still remain relatively low.\nBauer\nBauer's contribution to the Harbor Freight storefront is prominently stylized power tools in a red and black color scheme. The primary lineup from Bauer revolves around a 20V cordless model that utilizes a common power pack across the range (with over 65 tools completing the catalog). Shoppers will find all kinds of saws, drills, impact drivers, sanders, grinders, and even lawn care tools built under the Bauer name.\nThese are some of Harbor Freight's least expensive power tools, and can therefore make a big impact in a DIYer's toolbox during a renovation or new enhancement project. Getting good value out of the gear you use is a major victory for homeowners and renters alike, and the low price point of the Bauer brand can help make this a reality, regardless of the project at hand. It's worth noting that most Bauer cordless tools won't perform at professional levels, and so they aren't a great pick for those who consistently use their tools on a daily basis. Cutting power, torque, and overall motor function aren't quite as good as some other brands \u2014 including others in the Harbor Freight spectrum.\nHercules\nHercules is another of Harbor Freight's power tool brands. The retailer notes \"over 50 corded and cordless professional tools\" in the lineup of blue and black performers. Hercules tools include a variety of grinders, demolition hammers, and even a table and miter saw for versatile job site cutting. There's the obvious additions to the range like a hammer drill and circular saws, but the range's impact driver is a particular standout. It's a high torque driver that hangs with the most impressive competitors on the market, including Dewalt and Milwaukee.\nHercules strikes a unique balance between high-performance functionality and low prices. It's yet another Harbor Freight-owned brand that stands out amongst its peers. The cordless range is another 20-volt battery platform and Harbor Freight buyers might be wise to prioritize this tool platform over the Bauer range for its improved motor performance, which includes brushless technology for excellent longevity.\nHaul-Master\nNot only does Harbor Freight own brands focused on equipment, workshop essentials, and hand and power tools, but the retailer also owns the Haul-Master range. It's a brand focused on trailers and other material-handling gear, and it's a mainstay in the world of truck owners and others who work with heavy equipment.\nHaul-Master's lineup includes cargo-carrying additions, too. You can mount these frames on the roof of your car or as a basket attachment that fits at the rear. A variety of options can be found within the brand's offerings, making for a versatile cargo expansion in your daily driving experience. This is particularly useful for those who often have to transport large loads of equipment around or as a detachable augmentation for supporting DIY projects around the house that demand hefty material purchases. Lumber, sheetrock, and many other materials can be loaded up with ease after installing a Haul-Master cargo addition. The brand also features step stools and tie-down equipment to round out many professional or DIY equipment needs.\nUnion Safe Company\nSafes are another potentially surprising market that Harbor Freight's own brands have ventured into. The Union Safe Company offers a range of security measures for the home, from gun safes that keep weapons out of the hands of those not allowed to handle them to routine fireproof safes and electronic security tools. These are great for protecting sensitive documents or securing jewelry and expensive gear while you're away.\nUnion offers standing safes that range from small floor units to towering wardrobe-sized affairs. The brand also carries wall safes that can be installed inside a closet or elsewhere for comprehensive security. There are smaller safes for desk drawers and even biometric security boxes you can keep in your trunk for on-the-go security. And they're all priced like you'd expect of something from Harbor Freight. Indeed, there's a security option to fit any buyer's budget, regardless of their specific protection requirements.\nPredator\nPredator generators, pressure washers, and engines offer \"the best value in power,\" according to Harbor Freight. Predator is yet another brand owned by the retailer and specializes in power production. As is the case with many Harbor Freight goods, these tools ring up for prices that help save some serious dollars. From job site generators to backup power production during storms or other weather events, there's a wide range of options found within the Predator range.\nThe brand is also a great resource for pressure washing tools that can make quick work of even the most soiled paths, driveways, and walls. Rounding out the lineup, homeowners can take advantage of Predator's water pumps to deal with clean water or wastewater, and there are mowers, trimmers, and even log splitters and chainsaws for all manner of landscaping and yard work. These tools are particularly useful for anyone who lives in a rural area or an aspiring homesteader looking to get their start on a new patch of land.\nCentral Forge\nWoodworkers rejoice! Central Forge is a shop tool Mecca for anyone who likes to spend time honing wood products, metal gear, or even dabbling in building projects. From cold chisels and bolsters to mattocks, pickaxes, splitting mauls, and anvils, Central Forge offers a wide range of essential tools for those who ply their craft in a more creative, artisanal manner.\nThis is another excellent lineup of tools brought into the marketplace by Harbor Freight and it includes hand planes and wrecking bars, files, and awls. Central Forge products run the gamut of home improvement and fine crafting projects, making for a low-cost entry point into metal work, wood crafting, and demolition work in an effort to remake a portion of your home or garden. The range isn't large, consisting of just 19 tools in total, but these tools can do a huge amount of heavy lifting in just about any precision project you might be working on.\nDaytona\nDaytona's claim to fame revolves strictly around the automotive workplace. The brand is Harbor Freight's answer to the varied workspace needs of home mechanics everywhere. From car jacks to creepers and stands, the brand is ready to help tackle even the most demanding car rebuilding project.\nHarbor Freight's Daytona lineup includes a rotating engine stand, steel vehicle dollies, and a series of hydraulic body repair kits. Not only can you lift up your car and get under the body with ease on a Daytona jack, stand, and creeper setup, but the repair kits offered by Daytona are excellent complements to a dent or frame repair task. A 4-ton and 10-ton setup can be found in Harbor Freight's stocks, providing moderate and expansive pulling, prying, and pushing force for a whole range of frame and body repair needs. The tools from Daytona are sleek and well put together, with every one of them earning a near-perfect 5/5 in customer reviews (some products, like the 3-ton low-profile floor jack have achieved this accomplishment across nearly 5,000 reviews).\nChicago Electric\nChicago Electric is another brand owned by Harbor Freight that does considerable work for the retailer. The tool range focuses on welding and specialized project needs, like chainsaw sharpening, metal shearing, and tile cutting. Chicago Electric fits perfectly within the high-quality, low-cost model that Harbor Freight brings to the fold. The tool range is instrumental in the lives of DIYers looking to tackle highly specific projects around the house \u2014 like fixing metal components or remodeling a bathroom \u2014 but it also includes more standardized power tools, as well. One of the most important inclusions in the brand's stable might be its rotary, Dremel-style tool. The handheld rotary cutter provides a precision blade that can make small cuts in delicate or even hardened materials. It also comes with buffing and polishing heads, fine sanding attachments, and a wire wheel for precise cleanup.\nBuyers can also find a quality miter saw in the lineup, as well as an electric planer and a variety of welding essentials that make for a versatile brand at a truly eye-catching price. You might also be surprised to find that Chicago Electric also makes routers, biscuit jointers, circular saws, and an impact wrench for even greater depth across its range."

      "text": "Everything You Need To Consider Before Buying Makita Tools\nIf you're trying to figure out which tool brand is best for you, there are several things you should consider. What types of tools does the brand offer? How expensive are they? What's the warranty and how is the maintenance? Additionally, once you choose a brand, you'll want to learn which battery system is best to invest in, especially since the lower voltage battery line tends to come with fewer tool options.\nThat said, Makita, adorned in its famous teal blue, is one of the more popular tool brands found at Home Depot ... among other places. Makita has a rich history of consistently producing upgraded versions of classic power tools and ones you didn't even know you needed. Moreover, if you maintain your Makita power tools, they'll pay for themselves with long-lasting performance.\nHowever, before jumping on the Makita train, there are some things you need to assess to decide if the brand is right for you. Below is everything you need to know before you purchase any Makita tools, so you can be confident that you made the right choice.\nA little bit about the tool company\nIt wasn't until nearly 50 years after the company was founded in 1915 that Makita even started making power tools. In fact, the company originally repaired and sold motors and lighting equipment, among other things. After that point, though, Makita got into the business of creating innovative tools, especially since the company was the first to put cordless drills and brushless impact drivers on the market. Moving forward, Makita's mission was all about what can set it apart from the other competitive tool companies such as Milwaukee and Ryobi.\nWhere other companies may cater to DIY renovators and mechanics, Makita also considers the needs of the hobbyists and outdoor communities. The tool company came out with its Outdoor Adventure line that makes outdoor activities like camping, hiking, and even off-grid living a bit easier. Additionally, within the many choices of useful Makita products that aren't tools, there's even a robotic vacuum that is powered by the 18V battery system. In fact, if there's a project, hobby, or activity you're involved in, chances are that Makita will have some type of tool to make it more enjoyable or manageable.\nWhat types of tools Makita has\nMakita sells several different types of tools from corded to pneumatic. The most popular type that many users tend to purchase is cordless. The brand has three cordless platforms, each with a different weight, size, power, and runtime. With cordless, though, you have more freedom to move around during jobs. However, a downside of cordless tends is, of course, battery life. Once your cordless power tools have drained the batteries, you have to wait for them to charge to continue with the project.\nOn that note, Makita also sells some of its more popular and powerful power tools in a corded option. Why use corded tools when there's a cordless counterpart? Some jobs require more power for longer periods of time, while sometimes a battery can't handle the load needed to complete the job. Makita also makes pneumatic tools such as air compressors, staplers, and nailers. However, be aware that if you're looking for air tools such as an impact gun or an air hammer, you won't find those in Makita's lineup.\nDifferent battery systems\nAs stated above, Makita has created three battery systems for its cordless tools: CXT, LXT, and XGT. These batteries are integrated with cooling systems to help give them optimal performance and longer lifespans. They also come with impact resistance casings in case of accidental droppings or extreme conditions. The lowest, yet still powerful of the battery lines, is the 12V CXT, which comes with over 70 products in its system. You can find many useful tools in this line such as drills, box cutters, and some smaller yard equipment like grass shears and blowers.\nThe most popular battery line is the Makita 18V LXT system, which has over 350 products and counting. Within this line, you can find nearly every power tool you can think of from the Starlock oscillating tool to a fleet of lawnmowers. Some tools even come with 36V capabilities, meaning you insert two 18V batteries to get double the power. However, depending on the tool, sometimes you won't get double the runtime because the tool in question requires dual batteries simply for the power to run it.\nLastly, Makita sells its powerful 40V XGT system. This line has around 125 products as of 2024, but Makita is always adding to its stock. According to Makita, XGT tends to be for the more high-demand applications that would usually need either corded, gas, or air power to back it. Instead, the 40V batteries give the tool the same power with less hassle.\nWhat about the warranty?\nSpecific to Makita's products, the company has implemented multiple warranties. It is important to note that most of these are limited. According to Makita, the warranties will not apply if, upon inspection, it is concluded that repairs have been attempted by external repairers, or alterations have been made. Additionally, they'll inspect if the tools have been abused, misused, or improperly maintained. In terms of pneumatic nailers, if dry regulated compressed air or air pressure exceeding the maximum allowance has been used, the warranty will be voided. Also, normal wear and tear on parts such as driver belts, rubber o-rings, and seals, among other parts, will not be replaced for free. It's also crucial to understand that if your lithium-ion tool fails from using a non-Makita battery, warranty limitations will take effect.\nFor Lithium-ion tools, batteries, chargers, and pneumatic nail guns, you'll get a three-year limited warranty from the date of purchase. Within those three years, once inspected, if any issues are caused by defective workmanship or material, Makita will repair or replace the item without charge. There is also a one-year limited warranty and a 30-day satisfaction guarantee on all Makita general products.\nMakita has also implemented a two-year warranty on emissions related components such as the fuel metering system, the air induction system, the ignition system, and items used in the systems mentioned. Depending on the pneumatic tool you purchase, there may be more information about the two-year warranty in the annexed warranty sheet that comes with the product.\nWhere can you purchase Makita tools, and what about rebates?\nThe most common place to purchase Makita tools, especially if you want to see the tools in person, is going to be Home Depot. In fact, when you're browsing the tool aisles, it's hard to miss the bright teal against the Home Depot orange. However, you can't find Makita at Lowe's. But there are other places you can purchase the tools such as Tractor Supply, Acme Tools, and Amazon. If you want to find a specific product, you are encouraged to go directly to the Makita website, look for the tool, and click on the Buy Now button. From there, you'll see a Find Local tab and a View Online Tab. In the View Online option, you'll be able to click on the store and see the product page within that storefront.\nKeep in mind too that Makita's website often offers eRebates on qualifying items \u2014 you just have to make sure you are following the instructions. First off, you'll want to make sure you are purchasing the correct qualifying product. For example, one eRebate option available from August 1st to October 31st of 2024 is to purchase the XCU03PT 36V LXT Brushless 14 Inch Chain Saw Kit. If you do and submit the rebate, you'll receive a free 18V LXT Bluetooth Job Site Speaker.\nThe catch, though, is that you need to make sure you are purchasing the tools from an authorized dealer to receive the rebate, like Home Depot, Amazon, or one of the other stores listed on Makita's website. After, follow the instructions and submit your rebate. You can do a maximum of five items per promotion with a total of 25 redemptions.\nWhat are professional reviewers and everyday users saying\nIn many of the articles that SlashGear has done on Makita tools, an overwhelming number of products have had high ratings and positive reviews from both professional tool reviews and consumers. ProTool Reviews, a reputable online publication that is known for its expert knowledge of power tools, has tested many Makita products and given honest feedback. Some of the more current review articles and ratings have been the Makita 40V XGT Circular Saw Review with a 9.1 out of 10 score and the Makita Cordless Grease Gun with a 9.5 out of 10 score. On the other hand, in the publication's opinion, the Makita 18V X2 Battery Powered Blower only warranted an 8.1 due to the lack of power compared to other blowers on the market.\nHowever, everyday users' opinions of the brand are equally important \u2014 they're the ones who are truly testing the tools' durability. On discussion forums like Reddit, where users speak their minds, some have said that Makita makes solid tools, even if there aren't as many trade-specific tools as other brands."
