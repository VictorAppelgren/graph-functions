  "title": "From chai to cardamon: The 9 South Asian perfume notes that are wearable and luxe from \u00a328",
  "description": "We'll take them all, please!",
  "content": "This month is , a time to reflect, reconnect, and celebrate the richness of our cultures. There are many ways I feel closer to mine, food, fashion, and of course, fragrance. Scent, for me, is the key to unlocking treasured memories. A time machine that takes me back to moments that made me who I am. What I\u2019ve come to realise is that the notes I\u2019m most drawn to \u2013 citrus, spice, or florals \u2013 aren\u2019t random. They ground and uplift me and they are echoes of home.\n\nSince I can remember, my mum\u2019s signature scent has been D&G Light Blue; a bright and radiant burst of citrus, refreshing like that first sip of iced lemonade on a sunny day. As a result, citrus has always been a comforting scent to me \u2013 calm, joyful, and homely.\n\nThe notes that move me most carry me straight to the Motherland. Barefoot on soft soil outside my Nani and Nana\u2019s house, the air already thick with scent. Roses in every colour bloom wildly in the courtyard, petals blushing under the sun. Firewood crackles beneath a pot of masala chai, its spiced steam curling into the sky. In one corner, overripe oranges lay juiced and sun-warmed beneath the trees, their sweetness seeping into the earth.\n\nAcross the yard, lemons and grapefruits await the same fate. Inside, sandalwood and incense burn quietly, their smoky tendrils wrapping around laughter and conversation. It\u2019s an intoxication of scent \u2013 layered and alive \u2013 just like the people moving in and out of the home. Voices overlapping, children laughing, gold bangles clinking against porcelain as chai is poured. The chaos of fragrance mirrors the chaos of family village life, loud, loving, and somehow endlessly calm.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that the fragrances I am drawn to are warm and joyous. I always look for bergamot, a zesty citrus note with a floral twist, too. It doesn\u2019t just remind me of my mum\u2019s perfume \u2013 it transports me to my grandparents\u2019 village and feels like nature\u2019s version of a hug.\n\nOne of my favourite citrusy scents is Jo Malone London Orange Marmalade. Zesty orange peel and juicy citrus sweetness simmer into soft woods and sage. It takes me to barefoot afternoons in my Nani\u2019s garden, sun streaming through the orange trees, whilst I accidentally step on over ripe fruit, the squished juice seeping into my sandals. This scent is nostalgia bottled \u2013 sunlit, sticky, sweet, and golden.\n\nAnother favourite, especially in the summer, is Armani S\u00ec Eau de Parfum. While its opening sings with rich blackcurrant nectar, there\u2019s a quiet symphony of mandarin, orange, and bergamot woven through the fragrance. Just the faintest trace of it on a breeze in busy London feels unexpectedly grounding \u2014 a fleeting moment of calm amidst the chaos.\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s jasmine, which I rejected in my teens. Back then, it reminded me too much of my grandmother oiling my hair before school \u2013 long before it became an aesthetic trend. But now, as a mother myself, jasmine smells like love passed down through generations.\n\n\n\nGucci Bloom, with jasmine and tuberose, reminds me of the night before a family wedding \u2013 picking petals from fresh flowers, ready to be tossed at the bridal party in the morning. It\u2019s tradition, wrapped in excitement for something beautiful about to begin.\n\nTo make fragrance last longer, I layer with bath products like ESPA\u2019s Bergamot & Jasmine Bath and Shower Gel. It enhances my favourite notes and extends the scent throughout the day.\n\nTo deepen that even more, I use Phlur Missing Person Body Oil. With top notes of bergamot and jasmine, it hydrates while wrapping me in scent that feels like a balm for the soul.\n\nI couldn\u2019t talk about scent and home without mentioning spices. Strangely, I can\u2019t stand the taste of cardamom in desserts or chai \u2013 but the scent? It\u2019s intoxicating. A single whiff and I\u2019m flooded with memories.\n\nGuerlain \u00c9pices Exquises is also one of my most worn fragrances. Cardamom, deepened by sandalwood and oud, smells like gatherings of gold-draped women, their jewellery reflecting the shimmers of the sun. This scent is ceremony and celebration \u2013 rich, warm, and powerful.\n\nAt home, I love lighting Diptyque\u2019s Narguil\u00e9. It fills the room with honeyed tobacco and soft spice, like incense drifting through memory. It reminds me of village women gathered in quiet corners, sharing stories while smoking the chilm, wrapped in warmth and sisterhood.\n\n\n\nAll of my childhood memories feature at least one dish topped with pistachios, so it\u2019s no wonder I adore Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato 33. Creamy pistachio and sweet cardamom melt into zesty bergamot like a dessert you want to wear. It smells like warm kheer at a family gathering \u2013 soft, spiced, and surrounded by laughter.\n\nIn a South Asian home, food isn\u2019t just ingredients, it\u2019s a language where the scents carry memory, meaning, and identity. I never imagined I\u2019d want to wear them on my skin, yet here I am, drawn to fragrances that echo the very notes of my childhood holidays in the motherland. And while I may not speak the language of cooking fluently, fragrance has become my own way of storytelling \u2014 a scented dialect that fills my home.",

      "text": "It was the bane of my Sunday mornings as a child. My mum would come into the living room \u2013 where I\u2019d usually be enthralled by Sabrina The Teenage Witch on the television \u2013 with a green bottle of Dabur Vatika Coconut Hair Oil bobbing around in a bowl of hot water. If you grew up in a South Asian household, you likely know the drill. I\u2019d diligently sit on the floor while my mum rubbed, massaged and patted the melted oil on to my scalp and down the lengths of my hair until it was soaked. Each session was finished with me sporting a glistening, slicked-back plait and I\u2019d always ask the same question: \u2018Do you promise I can wash it out before school tomorrow?\u2019\nYou see, I\u2019d noticed my peers would get teased for their oiled hair on the school playground. Sure, the oil made my hair soft and strong. In fact, I know it\u2019s the reason I have healthy hair today. But at the time, I found the whole thing... well, embarrassing.\nFast-forward a few decades and now I practically beg my mum for a hair-oiling session. I don\u2019t care about leaving the house with oil-drenched lengths and I actively hunt down hair-oiling recipes on TikTok. So, what\u2019s changed since I was a child? Well, a lot.\nBack to our roots\nHair oiling has been around for over 3,000 years, but only now is this South Asian practice starting to hit mainstream consciousness, alongside morning turmeric lattes and monthly threading appointments (or fortnightly, if you\u2019re me). More and more South Asian-founded haircare brands are launching their own hair oils into major retailers, and the practice even took centre stage this year in one of Netflix\u2019s most popular shows of all time, Bridgerton.\nIt\u2019s blowing up on social media, too. A scroll through haircare content creator Seerat Saini\u2019s Instagram page reveals an encyclopedia of beneficial hair ingredients, including bringhraj (false daisy), curry leaves and even onion juice \u2013 though she recommends rinsing your hair thoroughly after trying the latter. During a late-night TikTok sesh, I came across one of Saini\u2019s how-to hair-oil videos, in which she advocated that everyone use heated oil on their scalps. Growing up in a time when I wasn\u2019t reflected in the media, it was so refreshing to see something that spoke directly to me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever double-tapped a post so quickly in my life.\n\"Hair oiling was a default part of haircare when I was younger, but I stopped aged 11, when I noticed my peers thought it was weird,\" says Saini. \"I lost half of my hair in 2019 and turned to the hair I had once abandoned. This isn\u2019t a TikTok hack or a \u201cslugging\u201d trend \u2013 it\u2019s a way to nourish the entire head.\"\nIt\u2019s all in the ritual\nThe tradition involves pouring warm oil on to your scalp and then massaging it in, taking time to focus on certain areas that stimulate blood circulation and encourage hair growth. \"In India, hair oiling is practised weekly by men and women,\" says Michelle Ranavat, whose eponymous brand, Ranavat, became the first Ayurvedic skincare company to launch at Harrods last year. And the great thing is it\u2019s so straightforward \u2013 all you need is oil and your hands.\nBegin by warming some oil in your hands and placing it on your crown chakra, says Nikita Mehta, who co-founded the Ayurvedic haircare brand Fable & Mane with her brother Akash Mehta. \"Then massage it into the scalp and use the remainder to finger-brush through the ends. Tie your strands back ina bun or loose braid and leave overnight if you can \u2013 or at least five minutes.\" Kuldeep Knox, founder of haircare brand Ch\u0101mpo, adds, \"The scalp massage is essential \u2013 it boosts blood flow and the circulation of oxygen and nutrients around the scalp, both of which promote healthy hair growth.\"\nThe psyche of your scalp\nThere are lots of advantages to hair oiling. \"As it dates back to ancient India, it\u2019s stood the test of time,\" says Knox. \"Oiling nourishes the scalp and protects hair, which means shiny, lustrous locks with less hair fall.\" Ranavat adds, \"Lots of people don\u2019t realise that our hair ages, as well as the environmental damage it goes through daily. It\u2019s important to protect it.\"\nThe great news is that hair oiling is beneficial for pretty much every hair type, regardless of your ethnicity, and there are countless ingredients to choose from to tailor accordingly. \"Hair isn\u2019t 'one size fits all', so choosing the best oil blend will depend on the specific needs of your hair and scalp,\" explains Knox. \"I like to use amla oil to strengthen and stimulate hair growth, as well as coconut oil to condition and moisturise.\"\nBut, even better, the process of hair oiling can have a positive impact on your mental health, too. In Ayurveda, the ritual of self-massage, self-love and self-care is known as \u2018abhyanga\u2019 and involves seeing your hair as an extension of your body\u2019s energy. \"The crown chakra is an energetic point that, when touched, helps release stress,\" explains Akash. He adds, \"There\u2019s a particular focus here on alleviating tension from the roots. And using a hair oil that has adaptogens will calm down your nervous system and balance energy.\"\nA deep connection\nWhile everyone\u2019s hair-oiling journey may be different, many in the South Asian community were exposed to it in a very similar way. Now that we\u2019re older, we recognise that hair oiling has always been important in building familial bonds and is an act of love.\nFor me, I love knowing that my at-home hair mask is the same one my mum learned from her mother as a child in Yemen, and one I\u2019ll pass down. It also helped me break down the language barrier with my Nani Maa (grandmother) any time she visited. When I ask these brand founders about their memories of hair oiling, Ranavat, Knox and the Mehtas mention their grandmothers, too. \"My grandmother would take me aside to massage my hair,\" recalls Ranavat. \"We used the practice to bond and connect. I love how I\u2019ve reconnected with this practice and am excited to pass it down to my boys.\"\nFor Akash and Nikita, anytime their grandmother visited from India, she arrived with handcrafted blends of plant oils, along with fables \u2013 hence the name of their brand. \"Our brand\u2019s DNA stems from the tradition of taking care of your hair, with regular oiling, originating from the Sanskrit word 'sneha', which means to oil and to love,\" explains Akash. \"Most Indian households experience an oil head massage by a family member to grow hair and relax the mind. This is usually performed before bedtime and makes room for stories and fables to be shared.\"\nTo return to our Bridgerton example, Kate Sharma (played by Simone Ashley) takes the time to massage oil on to her sister Edwina\u2019s (Charithra Chandran) head during a time of need. Not only is it to help Edwina\u2019s hair grow stronger, but it\u2019s a moment of intimacy and bonding between the two sisters.\nNow, hair oiling no longer feels embarrassing, but instead fills me with pride. It isn\u2019t just a way to treat my hair \u2013 it\u2019s something that will always bring my mum and me closer together.\nYour oiling cheat sheet\nInspired to whip up your own bespoke hair oil?
