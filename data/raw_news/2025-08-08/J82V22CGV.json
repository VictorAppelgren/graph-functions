Yet Maduro\u2019s reign of terror continues,\u201d Bondi said.\n\u201cHe is one of the largest narco traffickers in the world, and a threat to our national security,\u201d she added.\nBondi vowed that \u201cunder President Trump\u2019s leadership, Maduro will not escape justice, and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes.\u201d"

      "text": "Witness to Martha Nolan discovery describes sheer panic and desperate attempts to save the doomed designer on Montauk boat\nThe first bystander to reach the body of Manhattan fashion designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra at the Montauk Yacht Club said he and his friend were fast asleep when all hell broke loose.\nThe chaos unfolded around midnight Tuesday, when the two were awakened by screaming and saw the alleged owner of the boat where the tragedy unfolded dashing down the dock in a panic, the man said.\n\u201cWe were sound asleep,\u201d the eyewitness, who asked not to be identified, told The Post.\n\u201cWe heard someone shouting, stuff bouncing off the side of the boat. He threw sunscreen at our boat trying to wake us up,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was running up and down, naked, screaming, \u2018Do something!\u2019\nHe called 911 and then they boarded the Ripple \u2014 the boat where Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra lay dead or dying.\nSuffolk County police said the bystanders tried to resuscitate the popular designer before first responders arrived \u2014 but it was too late and the 33-year-old Irish-born beauty was pronounced dead.\nThe 911 caller and his pal, regulars at the yacht club, did not recognize Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra.\nCops said there was no evidence of violence done to Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s body, but have not ruled out foul play and have not released details of the department\u2019s investigation.\nAccording to sources, the owner of the boat owns a second one at the marina.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra moved to Manhattan in 2018 from the small Irish town of Carlow, starting off as a bottle service girl in Soho before founding East x East, her swimwear fashion company.\nDriven to succeed and gifted at marketing, she summered in the Hamptons in recent years, hosting pop-ups and wowing the upscale clientele drawn to Montauk and surrounding resort towns.\n\u201cMontauk, specifically, is so seasonal,\u201d one connected local businessman said Thursday. \u201cSo, you have to be more confident in yourself, because you\u2019ve got 90 days \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t rain \u2014 to make money.\n\u201cIt was very obvious to me that she was very driven and wanted to succeed,\u201d the man said. \u201cI got the impression that she is a young, ambitious, driven young woman who had a vision, and she thought that Montauk was a very good fit.\u201d\nHowever, while Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s death has rattled some in the East End, others are taking it in stride.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just on vacation so it\u2019s not something I\u2019m not thinking about much,\u201d one visitor who only identified herself as Ally told The Post.\nLocal resident Travis Fischer, 15, said news of the high-profile death has \u201cdampened the mood. We\u2019re still having fun and enjoying ourselves, but it\u2019s definitely on the back of my mind every now and then.\u201d"

      "text": "Trusted Biden aide testifies ex-prez skipped Super Bowl interview due to bombshell \u2018classified records\u2019 report: sources\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden opted to forgo a Super Bowl interview last year in part due to the release of the bombshell report from former special counsel Robert Hur about his handling of classified information, a close aide testified Thursday, two sources familiar told The Post.\nAnita Dunn, 67, former senior advisor to the president for communications, told the House Oversight Committee Thursday that fears over Biden, 82, getting grilled over the then-pending Hur report loomed over his team\u2019s decision.\n\u201cShe told the committee President Biden\u2019s team decided against doing a Super Bowl interview last year because they thought the main coverage would be about what he did with classified records and not about the President\u2019s policy decisions,\u201d a source close to Dunn told The Post.\n\u201cShe testified they decided this BEFORE the Hur report had come out.\u201d\nA second source familiar with Dunn\u2019s transcribed interview said she testified that \u201cBiden\u2019s team decided against doing a Super Bowl interview due to information contained in the Hur Report.\u201d\nThe Hur report, released on Feb. 5, 2024, concluded that \u201cat trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d\nThat conclusion kicked up a firestorm about Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity.\nThe Super Bowl LVIII took place on Feb. 11. Hur noted that Biden\u2019s counsel was given time to review the report on Feb. 3 and 4, before its release. Multiple outlets reported on Feb. 3 that Biden was sitting out the Super Bowl interview, after having done so in 2023 as well.\nBiden\u2019s decision not to sit for a Super Bowl interview raised eyebrows as it was a missed opportunity for him to get his message out to a massive audience of potential voters during an election season.\nDuring her roughly five-hour interview with the Oversight panel, Dunn recalled how the former president\u2019s team decided against him taking a cognitive test.\n\u201cMs. Dunn revealed that President Biden\u2019s inner circle came to a consensus he should not take a cognitive test, concluding it would offer no political benefit,\u201d the source explained.\nStill, Dunn, who has been in Biden\u2019s orbit since the 1980s, insisted that he was the ultimate decision-maker.\n\u201cPresident Biden also was appropriately accessible to the press,\u201d Dunn testified, per her opening statement obtained by The Post. \u201cBiden had more of these interactions with reporters than almost any other president over a four-year term, going back to Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\u201cI did not observe White House staff making key decisions or exercising the powers of the presidency without President Biden\u2019s knowledge or consent.\u201d\nShe pointed to data from Towson University scholar Martha Joynt Kumar, concluding that Biden held 37 press conferences, participated in 151 interviews and 679 informal gaggles with reporters over the course of his presidency.\nAt one point, she revealed that she was \u201cunaware\u201d of Biden\u2019s stutter \u201cuntil it was reported by the media in 2020\u201d and \u201cwent on to blame the media for pushing the narrative that President Biden was old,\u201d according to the source.\nDunn is now the 10th ex-Biden aide to appear before the powerful investigatory panel. No lawmakers were present for her transcribed interview, which was conducted by attorneys for the committee.\nShe avoided questions from the press both before and after her testimony.\nBruce Reed, Biden\u2019s former deputy chief of staff for policy, blamed the 46th president\u2019s infamous debate performance on his stutter during his testimony before the panel on Tuesday.\nDunn did two stints in the Biden White House from 2021 through August of last year. She had departed the administration briefly in 2021 before returning the following year. Prior to that, she served as the director of communications in the Obama administration.\nShe had cultivated close ties to the octogenarian president and was described by some as a tertiary member of Biden\u2019s so-called \u201cPolitburo,\u201d his tight-knit group of confidants who were described as the \u201cultimate decision-makers.\u201d\nThe GOP-led Oversight panel didn\u2019t subpoena Dunn for testimony, so she was unable to plead the Fifth Amendment like other Biden aides had done to avoid questioning.\nDunn\u2019s appearance before the Oversight Committee comes in response to Chairman James Comer\u2019s (R-Ky.) revival of his probe into whether there was a \u201ccover-up\u201d of Biden\u2019s fitness for office that he had opened during the previous Congress.\nThat probe has since been expanded to assess the 46th president\u2019s use of autopen to sign off on official documents.\nBiden has strenuously rejected GOP aspersions of his use of autopen, insisting that he was behind every decision.\nOther ex-Biden aides who sat before the Oversight panel, include former White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain; former senior adviser Mike Donilon; former counselor Steve Ricchetti; Jill Biden\u2019s powerful former chief of staff Anthony Bernal; former presidential physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor; Ashley Williams, former special assistant to the president and deputy director of Oval Office Operations; Neera Tanden, the former White House director of the Domestic Policy Council; and Bruce Reed, former deputy chief of staff for policy.\nThe Oversight Committee has at least four more interviews scheduled, including with former special adviser Ian Sams, former senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and former Chief of Staff Jeff Zients.\nSams is the next ex-aide scheduled to testify on Aug. 21."

      "text": "Massive shark caught off the Connecticut coast may break state record\nThe Thresher shark the men caught was nearly 16-feet long.\nEd Lovely, from Hampton, Connecticut, told ABC News he takes any chance he gets to go out in the water and fish for sharks.\nLovely, a 46-year-old owner of a drywall company, said a typical shark fishing excursion starts off \"nice and peaceful,\" where he places \"balloons out acting like a bobber to hold your bait to the depth you need.\" But then, \"all of a sudden -- bang -- a shark hits and chaos happens,\" he said.\nHis fishing trip last week began exactly the same, but here's the catch: he walked away with an estimated 700-pound shark that could potentially break the record for the largest one caught off Connecticut waters.\n\"I still can't believe we did this,\" Lovely told ABC News.\nThis gigantic catch -- which Lovely described as \"a monster\" -- occurred in the afternoon on July 30 off the coast of Stonington, Connecticut. Last year, Lovely caught 19 sharks, but he's \"never seen\" a Thresher shark -- mackerel sharks known for long tails that whip around -- this big in his life, he said.\nWhen they were out on the water that day, Lovely said they had been drifting a while and decided to go a mile further. Then once he had strung out the line, he said, \"Bang, I feel something,\" with the shark immediately pulling the line, he said.\n\"We started fighting from there,\" Lovely said.\nTwo hours into attempting to reel the fish in, the two could finally see the monumental size of this shark, with Lovely saying he was \"in awe.\"\n\"Wow, holy mackerel, look at that shark, it is the biggest shark I've ever seen,\" Lovely said he was thinking at the time.\nLovely said he and his friend worked over six hours to reel the creature in, and once they did, they \"laid on the deck and started laughing like kids, just laying there in the dark with headlamps on.\"\nSince the 16.5-foot-long fish was not going to fit in his 16-foot-long boat, the two tied the shark to the side of the boat and drove to the dock, Lovely said. With the help of his son and a trailer, they were able to successfully transport the shark and leave the dock at approximately 1 a.m.\nThe whole time, Lovely said what kept him going was \"mental strength.\"\n\"When we were fighting the fish before dark, I said to my buddy, 'It's getting dark, I don't have lights, maybe we should cut the line.' He turned around, looks at me and goes, 'We're not cutting the line, we're all in.' I got the headlamps out, and we kept fighting into the dark until we finally got him. It was insane, it was awesome,\" Lovely said.\nNow, Lovely is in communication with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to see if his catch will actually break the record. A spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection also confirmed to ABC News that this feat is under review for the Marine Trophy Fish Award.\nIn the meantime, the shark's meat has been cut up, filleted and put in coolers to be shared with friends and family, his wife Cynthia told ABC News.\nLovely's advice for anyone aspiring to do the same? \"Go out there and try it.\"\nWhen asked if he would aspire to top this record, Lovely replied: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\"If there's one that big on the line, I'm cutting the line,\" Lovely told ABC News."
