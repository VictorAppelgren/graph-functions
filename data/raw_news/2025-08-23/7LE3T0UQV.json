  "title": "She Was Dying\u2014Then a Swarm of Stinging Bees Healed Her",
  "description": "Bee venom saved a woman\u2019s life\u2014and could be the basis of future drugs for a range of painful conditions.",
  "content": "\u2022 Bee stings unexpectedly cured a woman\u2019s Lyme disease, even after her body was breaking down from disease complications.\n\u2022 Bee venom\u2019s main component, melittin, kills Lyme bacteria in research and anecdotal reports, but it isn\u2019t medically approved.\n\u2022 Research on therapeutic uses of bee venom is ongoing because it does show promise.\n\n\n\nOne sunny day, Ellie Lobel, who had a Ph.D. in nuclear physics and three children, was attacked by a horde of Africanized bees, commonly called \u201ckiller\u201d bees. Lobel shielded her eyes and expected to have a deadly anaphylactic reaction, she said in a 2015 describing her experience. The 45-year-old English woman was in palliative care in California because she was dying from Lyme disease. She had stepped outside to experience some sunshine and peace when the bees attacked. Swollen and in pain, Lobel expected the end was imminent. At least, that\u2019s what she thought.\n\nFifteen years earlier, Lobel had unknowingly endured a tick bite. The tick carried the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. If caught in time, Lyme disease is treatable with antibiotics, though the bacteria are known to sneak around the immune system and even cause flare-ups long after apparent recovery. Borrelia burgdorferi can travel everywhere in the body, even to the heart and brain, causing neurological degradation, terrible pain, and a host of complications. About 476,000 people per year get Lyme disease in the U.S., according to a from March. Unfortunately, Lobel\u2014whose doctors didn\u2019t identify the symptoms as Lyme disease until over a year after she was bitten at age 27\u2014was one of the unlucky ones. Suffering with increasingly unbearable symptoms in a body that was breaking down, Lobel had accepted that she wouldn\u2019t live long.\n\nFor three days after the bee attack, Lobel endured fevers and throbbing inflammation. On the fourth day, she woke and unexpectedly felt normal, the first time she felt a sliver of normalcy in 15 years. Over the next days, weeks, and months, Lobel\u2019s condition improved dramatically, her brain fog clearing, her pain diminishing, and her strength returning. While researching bee venom, she realized that the melittin in the venom, which causes an instant burning sensation under the skin during bee stings, must have been her savior. Blood tests later confirmed that there was no more Borrelia in her body. It was gone.\n\nMany cultures have touted the benefits of animal venom. Bee venom therapy in particular has been used as far back as ancient Egypt, says a 2024 article from research database company . Modern studies show that bee venom\u2019s key component melittin has \u201cantibacterial and antifungal activities, and potential anti-tumor properties,\u201d according to a 2017 in the journal Neuroscience Bulletin. have also proven its antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-cancer effects. A small protein molecule composed of 26 amino acids, melittin contains both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory compounds, and it can literally make bacterial cells explode because it weakens a cell\u2019s protective membrane. A November 2017 of bee venom and melittin published in the journal Antibiotics showed that, at least outside of a living organism, the compound killed Borrelia burgdorferi.\n\nResearchers looking for new therapeutic drugs have been making forays into the potential of animal venom for decades, with some succeeding. Perhaps the most famous contemporary example is Ozempic, whose main drug compound mimics a venom component of the Gila monster, a venomous lizard native to the southwestern U.S.\n\nIn 1997, Glenn King at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia put the venom of the deadly Australian funnel-web spider under scrutiny, and figured out how to tease out its disparate components. \u201cI was just blown away,\u201d he told the . \u201cThis is an absolute pharmacological goldmine that nobody\u2019s really looked at.\u201d Now he and other researchers are developing a drug from a key molecule in the venom that prevents injuries to heart cells during heart attacks.\n\nMany therapeutic venom studies haven\u2019t passed the point of animal testing though. Anecdotal and preliminary studies show that bee venom could relieve pain, symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis when a trained medical professional injects it under the skin. Bee venom is also being investigated for use in killing HIV cells. However, more research is needed before it could potentially become a standard treatment for any of these conditions, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nLobel herself went on to experiment extensively with bee venom\u2014on herself\u2014and eventually developed a self-administered treatment protocol for Lyme disease, ensuring the elimination of her own disease in the process. She has spent the past several years promoting her Bee Venom Therapy protocol for Lyme disease\u2014which uses live honey bees\u2019 stings\u2014and educating people about the disease. Lobel has also written a book about how to self-administer bee sting therapy if you suffer from this disease. However, medical professionals consider it a controversial alternative treatment because it is not approved by any medical agency, and the Centers for Disease Control doesn\u2019t mention it as a treatment.\n\nSome people who have used the therapy and found relief, like of the UK, report that it\u2019s a last-ditch effort because nothing else has worked to relieve their terrible symptoms. But the treatment doesn\u2019t work the same for everybody, she cautions, and the very real possibility of dying from a bee venom allergy always hovers in the background. The top of Hayward\u2019s article on the Lyme Disease UK website recommends not attempting self-treatment \u201cwithout precautionary measures and oversight by a medical professional.\u201d",

      "text": "Key points\nSurveillance data explained\nLyme disease has been a nationally notifiable condition in the United States since 1991. Reports of Lyme disease are routinely collected and verified by state and local health departments in accordance with their legal mandate and surveillance practices. After removal of personal identifiers, selected information on cases is shared with CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Policies regarding case definitions, reporting, confidentiality, and data release are determined by states and territories under the auspices of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). Surveillance data have a number of limitations that need to be considered in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.\n- Under-reporting and misclassification are features common to all surveillance systems. Not every case of Lyme disease is reported to CDC, and some cases that are reported may be due to another cause.\n- Surveillance data are captured by county of residence, not county of exposure.\n- States may close their annual surveillance dataset at a different time than CDC. Thus, the final case counts published by CDC may not exactly match numbers published by each state agency for a given year.\n- Following its implementation in 1991, the national surveillance case definition for Lyme disease was modified in 1996, 2008, 2011, 2017, and again in 2022. Some of these changes impacted surveillance data and must be considered when attempting to interpret trends. Case definitions for each period are available.\nAlternative data sources\nCDC is currently working to establish enhanced surveillance and research platforms for Lyme disease using electronic health records (EHRs) from large healthcare systems in areas of the U.S. with a high incidence of Lyme disease. The Surveillance Based Lyme Disease Network is comprised of partners in healthcare systems from Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. CDC will use these EHR data in concert with traditional public health surveillance data to better understand how Lyme disease affects the American public."

      "text": "\u2018How a bee sting saved my life\u2019\nEllie Lobel was ready to die. Then she was attacked by bees. Christie Wilcox hears how venom can be a saviour.\nEllie Lobel was 27 when she was bitten by a tick and contracted Lyme disease. And she was not yet 45 when she decided to give up fighting for survival.\nCaused by corkscrew-shaped bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi, which enter the body through the bite of a tick, Lyme disease is diagnosed in around 300,000 people every year in the United States. It kills almost none of these people, and is by and large curable \u2013 if caught in time. Antibiotics can wipe out the bacteria quickly before they spread through the heart, joints and nervous system.\nBut back in the spring of 1996, Ellie didn\u2019t know to look for the characteristic bull\u2019s-eye rash when she was bitten \u2013 she thought it was just a weird spider bite. Then came three months with flu-like symptoms and horrible pains that moved around the body. Ellie was a fit, active woman with three kids, but her body did not know how to handle this new invader. She was incapacitated. \u201cIt was all I could do to get my head up off the pillow,\u201d Ellie remembers.\nHer first doctor told her it was just a virus, and it would run its course. So did the next. As time wore on, Ellie went to doctor after doctor, each giving her a different diagnosis. Multiple sclerosis. Lupus. Rheumatoid arthritis. Fibromyalgia. None of them realised she was infected with Borrelia until more than a year after she contracted the disease \u2013 and by then, it was far too late.\n\u201cI just kept doing this treatment and that treatment,\u201d says Ellie. Her condition was constantly worsening. She describes being stuck in bed or a wheelchair, not being able to think clearly, feeling like she\u2019d lost her short-term memory and not feeling \u201csmart\u201d anymore. \u201cI would get better for a little while, and then I would just relapse right back into this horrible Lyme nightmare. And with every relapse it got worse.\u201d\nAfter 15 years, she gave up. \u201cNothing was working any more, and nobody had any answers for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t care if I was going to see my next birthday. It\u2019s just enough. I was ready to call it a life and be done with it.\u201d\nSo she packed up everything and moved to California to die. And she almost did.\nLess than a week after moving, Ellie was attacked by a swarm of Africanised bees.\nSwarm saviour\nEllie was in California for three days before her attack. \u201cI wanted to get some fresh air and feel the sun on my face and hear the birds sing. I knew that I was going to die in the next three months or four months. Just laying there in bed all crumpled up\u2026 It was kind of depressing.\u201d\nAt this point, Ellie was struggling to stand on her own. She had a caregiver on hand to help her shuffle along the rural roads by her place in Wildomar, the place where she had chosen to die.\nShe was just standing near a broken wall and a tree when the first bee appeared, she remembers, \u201cjust hitting me in the head\u201d. \u201cAll of a sudden \u2013 boom! \u2013 bees everywhere.\u201d\nHer caregiver ran. But Ellie couldn\u2019t run \u2013 she couldn\u2019t even walk. \u201cThey were in my hair, in my head, all I heard was this crazy buzzing in my ears. I thought: wow, this is it. I\u2019m just going to die right here.\u201d\nEllie, like 1\u20137% of the world\u2019s population, is severely allergic to bees. When she was two, a sting put her into anaphylaxis, a severe reaction of the body\u2019s immune system that can include swelling, nausea and narrowing of the airways. She nearly died. She stopped breathing and had to be revived by defibrillation. Her mother drilled a fear of bees into her to ensure she never ended up in the same dire situation again.\nStrong sting\nBees \u2013 and some other species in the order Hymenoptera, such as ants and wasps \u2013 are armed with a potent sting. This is their venom, and it\u2019s a mixture of many compounds. Perhaps the most important is a tiny 26-amino-acid peptide called melittins, which is responsible for the feeling of burning.\nWhen we experience high temperatures, our cells release inflammatory compounds that activate a special kind of channel, TRPV1, in sensory neurons. This ultimately causes the neurons to send a signal to the brain that we\u2019re burning. Melittin subversively makes TRPV1 channels open by activating other enzymes that act just like those inflammatory compounds.\n\u201cI could feel the first five or 10 or 15 but after that... All you hear is this overwhelming buzzing, and you feel them hitting your head, hitting your face, hitting your neck,\u201d says Ellie.\n\u201cI just went limp. I put my hands up and covered my face because I didn\u2019t want them stinging me in the eyes\u2026 The next thing I know, the bees are gone.\u201d\nWhen the bees finally dissipated, her caregiver tried to take her to the hospital, but Ellie refused to go. \u201cThis is God\u2019s way of putting me out of my misery even sooner,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m just going to accept this.\n\u201cI locked myself in my room and told him to come collect the body tomorrow.\u201d\nBut Ellie didn\u2019t die. Not that day, and not three to four months later.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe that was three years ago, and I just can\u2019t believe where I am now,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI had all my blood work done. Everything. We tested everything. I\u2019m so healthy.\u201d\nShe believes the bees, and their venom, saved her life.\nThe idea that the same venom toxins that cause harm may also be used to heal is not new. Bee venom has been used as a treatment in East Asia for centuries. In Chinese traditional medicine, scorpion venom is recognised as a powerful medicine, used to treat everything from eczema to epilepsy. Mithradates VI of Pontus, a formidable enemy of Rome (and also an infamous toxinologist), was said to have been saved from a potentially fatal wound on the battlefield by using steppe viper venom to stop the bleeding.\n\u201cOver millions of years, these little chemical engineers have developed a diversity of molecules that target different parts of our nervous system,\u201d says Ken Winkel, Director of the Australian Venom Research Unit at the University of Melbourne. \u201cThis idea of applying these potent nerve toxins to somehow interrupt a nervous disease has been there for a long time. But we haven\u2019t known enough to safely and effectively do that.\u201d\nDespite the wealth of history, the practical application of venoms in modern therapeutics has been minimal. That is, until the past 10 years or so, according to Glenn King at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. In 1997, when Ellie was bouncing around from doctor to doctor, King was teasing apart the components of the venom from the Australian funnel-web, a deadly spider. He\u2019s now at the forefront of venom drug discovery.\nKing\u2019s group was the first to put funnel-web venom through a separation method called high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which can separate out different components. \u201cI was just blown away,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an absolute pharmacological goldmine that nobody\u2019s really looked at. Clearly hundreds and hundreds of different peptides.\u201d\nOver the course of the 20th Century, suggested venom treatments for a range of diseases have appeared in scientific and medical literature. Venoms have been shown to fight cancer, kill bacteria, and even serve as potent painkillers \u2013 though many have only gone as far as animal tests. At the time of writing, just six had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for medical use (one other \u2013 Baltrodibin, adapted from the venom of the Lancehead snake \u2013 is not FDA approved, but is available outside the US for treatment of bleeding during operations).\nThe more we learn about the venoms that cause such awful damage, the more we realise, medically speaking, how useful they can be. Like the melittin in bee venom.\nMolecular moves\nMelittin does not only cause pain. In the right doses, it punches holes in a cell\u2019s protective membranes, causing cells to explode. At low doses, melittin associates with the membranes, activating lipid-cutting enzymes that mimic the inflammation caused by heat. But at higher concentrations, and under the right conditions, melittin molecules group together into rings creating large pores in membranes, weakening a cell\u2019s protective barrier and causing the entire cell to swell and pop like a balloon.\nBecause of this, melittin is a potent antimicrobial, fighting off a variety of bacteria and fungi with ease. But its power doesn\u2019t stop there. Scientists hope it could fight diseases ranging from HIV to cancer, arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\nFor example, researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri, have found that melittin can tear open HIV\u2019s protective membrane without harming human cells. This envelope-busting method also stops the virus from having a chance to evolve resistance. \u201cWe are attacking an inherent physical property of HIV,\u201d Joshua L Hood, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. \u201cTheoretically, there isn\u2019t any way for the virus to adapt to that. The virus has to have a protective coat.\u201d Initially envisioned as a prophylactic vaginal gel, the hope is that melittin-loaded nanoparticles could someday be injected into the bloodstream, clearing the infection.\nTall tale\nBut could bees really have cured Lyme disease? Ellie is the first to admit that her tale sounds a little tall. \u201cIf someone were to have come to me and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll sting you with some bees, and you\u2019ll get better\u2019, I would have said, \u2018Absolutely not! You\u2019re crazy in your head!\u2019\u201d But she has no doubts now.\nAfter the attack, Ellie watched the clock, waiting for anaphylaxis to set in, but it didn\u2019t. Instead, three hours later, her body was racked with pains. A scientist by education before Lyme took its toll, Ellie thinks that these weren\u2019t a part of an allergic response, but instead indicated a Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer reaction \u2013 her body was being flooded with toxins from dying bacteria. The same kind of thing can happen when a person is cured from a bad case of syphilis. A theory is that certain bacterial species go down swinging, releasing nasty compounds that cause fever, rash and other symptoms.\nFor three days, she was in pain. Then, she wasn\u2019t.\n\u201cI had been living in this\u2026 I call it a brown-out because it\u2019s like you\u2019re walking around in a half-coma all the time with the inflammation of your brain from the Lyme. My brain just came right out of that fog. I thought: I can actually think clearly for the first time in years.\u201d\nWith a now-clear head, Ellie started wondering what had happened. So she did what anyone else would do: Google it. Disappointingly, her searches turned up very little. But she did find one small 1997 study by scientists at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana, who\u2019d found that melittin killed Borrelia. Exposing cell cultures to purified melittin, they reported that the compound completely inhibited Borrelia growth. When they looked more closely, they saw that shortly after melittin was added, the bacteria were effectively paralysed, unable to move as their outer membranes were under attack. Soon after, those membranes began to fall apart, killing the bacteria.\nConvinced by her experience and the limited research she found, Ellie decided to try apitherapy, the therapeutic use of materials derived from bees.\nHer bees live in a \u201cbee condo\u201d in her apartment. She doesn\u2019t raise them herself; instead, she mail orders, receiving a package once a week. To perform the apitherapy, she uses tweezers to grab a bee and press it gently where she wants to be stung. \u201cSometimes I have to tap them on the tush a little bit,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they\u2019re usually pretty willing to sting you.\u201d\nShe started on a regimen of 10 stings a day, three days a week: Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Three years and several thousand stings later, Ellie seems to have recovered. Slowly, she has reduced the number of stings and their frequency \u2013 just three stings in the past eight months, she tells me (and one of those she tried in response to swelling from a broken bone, rather than Lyme-related symptoms). She keeps the bees around just in case, but for the past year before I talked to her, she\u2019d mostly done just fine without them.\nComplex cocktails\nRare cases like Ellie\u2019s are a reminder of the potent potential of venoms. But turning folk knowledge into pharmaceuticals can be a long and arduous process. \u201cIt could take as long as 10 years from the time you find it and patent it,\u201d says King. \u201cAnd for every one that you get through, 10 fail.\u201d\nSince the 1997 study, no one had looked further into bee venom as a potential cure for Lyme disease, until Ellie.\nEllie has partnered with a bee farm that uses a special electrified glass plate to extract venom. As the bees walk across the plate on the way to and from their hive, harmless currents stimulate the bees to release venom from their abdomens, leaving teeny little droplets on the glass, which are later collected. Ellie says it takes 10,000 bees crossing that plate to get 1 gram of venom (other sources, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, quote 1 million stings per gram of venom), but \u201cthose bees are not harmed\u201d.\nShe sends some of the venom she purchases \u2013 which, due to the cost of the no-harm extraction method she uses, she says is \u201cmore expensive than gold\u201d \u2013 to Eva Sapi, Associate Professor of Biology and Environmental Science at the University of New Haven, who studies Lyme disease.\nSapi\u2019s research into the venom\u2019s effects on Lyme bacteria is ongoing and as yet unpublished, though she told me the results from preliminary work done by one of her students look \u201cvery promising\u201d. Borellia bacteria can shift between different forms in the body, which is part of what makes them so hard to kill. Sapi has found that other antibiotics don\u2019t actually kill the bacteria but just push them into another form that is more dormant. As soon as you stop the antibiotics, the Borellia bounce back. Her lab is testing different bee venoms on all forms of the bacteria, and so far, the melittin venom seems effective.\nThe next step is to test whether melittin alone is responsible, or whether there are other important venom components. \u201cWe also want to see, using high-resolution images, what exactly happens when bee venom hits Borellia,\u201d Sapi told me.\nShe stresses that much more data is needed before any clinical use can be considered. \u201cBefore jumping into the human studies, I would like to see some animal studies,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's still a venom.\u201d And they still don\u2019t really know why the venom works for Ellie, not least because the exact cause of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms remains unknown. \u201cIs it effective for her because it\u2019s killing Borellia, or is it effective because it stimulates the immune system?\u201d asks Sapi. It\u2019s still a mystery.\nThe bigger picture, however, is that venomous animals could prove be excellent drug resources for devastating neurological diseases, as so many of their venoms target our nervous system. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have great drugs in this area,\u201d says Ken Winkel, \u201cand we have these little factories that have a plethora of compounds\u2026\u201d\nNo one knows exactly how many venomous species there are on this planet. There are venomous jellyfish, venomous snails, venomous insects, even venomous primates. \u201cWhen people ask me what\u2019s the best way to convince people to preserve nature, your weakest argument is to talk about how beautiful and wonderful it is,\u201d says Bryan Fry. Instead, he says, we need to emphasise the untapped potential that these species represent. \u201cIt\u2019s a resource, it\u2019s money. So conservation through commercialisation is really the only sane approach.\u201d\nEllie couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cWe need to do a lot more research on these venoms,\u201d she tells me emphatically, \u201cand really take a look at what\u2019s in nature that\u2019s going to help us.\u201d\nThis is an edited version of an article originally published by Mosaic, and is reproduced under a Creative Commons licence.

      "text": "The human body is a regeneration machine\u2014wounds heal, fractures mend, and even organs like the liver can regrow from just one-third its original size. However, in the broad context of the animal kingdom, humans are relative novices in the regeneration department. While we as mammals are pretty adept at regenerating some tissues, certain fishes, amphibians, and reptiles can regrow entire limbs and major organs, including tissue in the brain, the central nervous system, the heart, and even the retina, the innermost, light-sensitive tissue of the eye.\nFor decades, scientists have been looking for some way to circumvent nature and regrow retinal neuron cells in mammals. Roughly 300 million people worldwide have some form of retinal degeneration, which can seriously reduce vision and even cause blindness. The central problem is that most mammalian central nervous systems tissues lack the capacity for regeneration. Recently, a team at The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology found promising results in experiments with mice, particularly because mice are also mammals and share similar traits. In a Nature Communications study published in late March, the scientists detail a novel new method that they claim can restore vision.\nPrevious studies have shown that many animals have the remarkable ability to regrow retinal cells, but none more so than the zebrafish. After an injury, they can reprogram their M\u00fcller glial cells\u2014whose role is to maintain the functionality of retinal cells\u2014to eventually specialize as various neural cell types. These new cells effectively replace the damaged cells with functional retinal neurons, a pretty neat trick.\nSadly, more than 375 million years of evolution separate humans and zebrafish, so pulling off a similar feat isn\u2019t so easy.\nThe Korea Institute\u2019s team gets around this mammalian limitation by suppressing a protein called PROX1, which inhibits the development of different retinal cell types in mammals. Researchers noticed in their experiments that PROX1 tended to accumulate in mouse M\u00fcller glial cells\u2014which act as support cells for retinal neurons\u2014after an injury. Notably, this inhibiting process didn\u2019t occur in the same cells of fish with known retinal regenerative abilities.\nBy blocking PROX1\u2014and so preventing the suppression of new retinal cells\u2014the team sustained retinal regeneration in mice with retinitis pigmentosa, a disease that occurs when photoreceptors in the retina deteriorate. The effects of the regeneration lasted for six months, allowing the scientists to boldly declare that this was \u201cfirst successful induction of long-term neural regeneration in mammalian retinas.\u201d\nSince the eye is an extremely complex organ, scientists around the world have been investigating different molecular mechanisms that could be responsible for our inability to regrow retinal neurons. One of these was a 2019 study that looked into the \u201cHippo pathway,\u201d which keeps retinal regeneration dormant.\nAnd a 2022 study published in Oxford Open Neuroscience found that when amphibians\u2019 retinal cells are damaged, these animals have \u201cciliary marginal zone cells\u201d that go to work proliferating new retinal cells. The study also discussed experiments on mice that demonstrated how certain genetic modifications can improve retinal regeneration. \u201cIn many animal tissues that contain stem cells \u2026 degenerated cells are replenished by new cells, allowing these tissues to maintain their functions despite continuous cell loss,\u201d the authors wrote.\nRecently, other scientists have taken a more hardware-centric approach, developing methods that use gold nanoparticles stimulated by lasers to circumvent damaged photoreceptors. This method can also stimulate cells located further up the visual chain and could be useful for the condition retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration.\nWhether through hardware or cellular intervention, science is quickly helping humanity gain some regenerative ground on other members of the animal kingdom, who do it naturally.\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our world works.

      "text": "In the early 2000s, Sydney\u2019s Royal North Shore Hospital in Australia faced a frustrating mystery. Patients started coming in with reports of sudden, anaphylactic shock, which causes a drop in blood pressure and severe breathing difficulties. Sydney allergy specialist Sheryl van Nunen realized they all had two things in common in their histories: a meal of red meat such as steak, lamb, or even kangaroo earlier in the day, and a tick bite reaction that caused an unusually large, swollen red spot. Similar cases cropped up in other parts of the world as well, including Australia, Japan, the Middle East, Europe, and South Africa. In the U.S. the colorectal cancer drug Cetuximab began causing severe allergic reactions in nearly one in four patients in Tennessee and North Carolina\u2014a hotspot for the lone star tick. The drug uses an antibody derived from a mouse cell line. Most people may not know, but mice are also considered red meat.\nPatients on both continents were shocked to realize that their tick bites meant the meat they\u2019d loved eating all their lives was now off-limits. A single bite had rewired their immune systems to reject a particular sugar molecule called alpha-gal that\u2019s found in most non-primate mammals.\nAbout 25 years ago, incidents of this red meat allergy were pretty rare. However, researchers studying the condition have seen a worrying rise in the number of infected people. In July 2023, the CDC estimated that up to 450,000 people in the U.S. may now have alpha-gal syndrome already and that exploding tick populations could make the problem more prevalent. More than 110,000 suspected cases between 2010 and 2022 were positively identified\u2014but not everyone who suspects the condition gets tested, according to the news release.\nIn the U.S., the lone star tick population, which mainly inhabits the eastern part of the country, is exploding as the climate continues warming. Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published research in April in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases that estimates Americans will be at higher risk of becoming totally allergic to red meat, or even to other mammalian foods, such as dairy products or gelatin, which is made from bone marrow.\nThe allergy is especially insidious, because while in many cases it shows up hours after a tick bite, it may only show up years after being bitten, making symptoms hard to identify as alpha-gal syndrome.\nCertain ticks, such as the paralysis tick in Australia and the lone star tick in the U.S., can set off the changes in their hosts\u2019 immune systems. First, the blood-sucker feeds on a mammal, picking up a sugar molecule called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal). Then it feeds on a human, potentially delivering the mammalian sugar molecule into the human blood stream. Hours, days, or months later, the human immune system has an extreme reaction to any mammalian meat, such as beef, pork, goat, lamb, venison and rabbit, according to the Mayo Clinic. Sufferers may experience any of a range of symptoms, from itchy hives to swelling of the face, to nausea or vomiting, or even anaphylactic shock, which can lead to death.\nThere is no treatment or cure, other than avoiding red meat entirely. Some people have found they have to avoid foods derived from mammals as well, such as dairy products, since they can also contain alpha gal.\nOminously, ticks other than the lone star tick in the U.S. are now implicated in alpha-gal syndrome as well, including deer ticks and the western blacklegged tick. Both of these are better known as transmitters of Lyme Disease.\nBut there\u2019s still hope for meat-lovers. While it\u2019s true you\u2019re at greater risk if you\u2019re in a tick-populated region and spending time in the great outdoors, you don\u2019t have to panic if you find a tick on yourself. First, always do a tick check after your outing! The less time a tick spends on you, the better your chances of not picking up bacteria or alpha-gal. A common method of removing a tick is to squeeze its body with fine tweezers and pull it out. However, if this is done with a jerking or twisting motion, it could leave the mouth parts embedded, giving unwanted baddies time to enter your bloodstream. The CDC recommends using slow and even pressure during the procedure.\nHowever, the best tick-removal method may come from Sydney allergy specialist van Nunen and her team. They recommend first freezing the tick with a spray that contains ether, typically used for warts and found in most pharmacies. That way, the whole tick, mouth parts and all, will likely fall out on its own. Squeezing the body actually pushes more stomach contents and saliva into the bite.\nAnd preventing a bite is the first line of defense: use insect-repellent spray and cover as much of yourself with clothing as you can before you head out. A good tick repellent should have a concentration of at least 20 percent DEET, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and repels ticks for 2\u201310 hours, depending on the concentration.\nThere\u2019s a ray of hope for those who develop alpha-gal syndrome, too. A study published in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases in July showed that levels of alpha-gal in your bloodstream decrease in the absence of subsequent tick bites. However, researchers still don\u2019t know how rapidly alpha-gal diminishes. The study did recommend that after a year of avoiding triggers, people with the syndrome should get their levels checked. If alpha-gal levels do fall below a certain threshold, it may be possible to enjoy that steak again.\nBefore joining Popular Mechanics in 2022, Manasee Wagh worked as a science journalist, a newspaper reporter, a technical writer, and an engineer.

      "text": "- Groundbreaking research revealed that many genes in mice, zebrafish, and humans actually become more active after clinical death.\n- This suggests that we need to redefine death, because it\u2019s not a simple switch. Instead, cells enter a sort of twilight zone when the organism dies.\n- Related research also raises profound questions about consciousness and dying, and also may yield medical knowledge about the death process.\nAfter a long day in the lab, two biologists joked over beers about studying what happens to genes, the body\u2019s protein-based hereditary DNA sequences, after death. \u201cWell, of course, all the genes stop,\u201d said Peter Noble, Ph.D, who was then splitting time between the University of Washington and the Max Planck Society, a preeminent research organization in Germany. \u201cThat\u2019d be an interesting experiment to do,\u201d replied Alex Pozhitkov, Ph.D, who was based at Max Planck. What began as a playful exchange soon took on a life of its own, however. The pair spent the next year doggedly pursuing funding\u2014and fielding plenty of skepticism. \u201cPeople thought we were crazy,\u201d Noble recalls. But Max Planck eventually came through.\nThe team ran experiments on mice and zebrafish. What they discovered (and published in 2017) was startling: around a thousand genes didn\u2019t just linger\u2014they became more active after clinical death, at distinct intervals ranging from 30 minutes to 48 hours. Many of the activated genes regulated inflammation, immune defense, embryonic development, and even cancer. This unexpected activity became known as the thanatotranscriptome\u2014from Thanatos, the Greek god of death, and transcriptome, the full set of RNA in a cell. It refers to genes that turn on postmortem, as if cells were trying to mount a final biological response. Death, Noble concluded, isn\u2019t a biological switch but more of a dimmer\u2014ushering in what he calls a \u201ctwilight,\u201d third state between life and full cellular decay.\nA 2018 study from Barcelona\u2019s Centre for Genomic Regulation reinforced this view. Researchers analyzed over 7,000 RNA samples from 540 deceased human donors and found that gene expression ramps up in a tissue-dependent manner. Their work, published in Nature Communications, even suggested this posthumous activity could help estimate time of death. \u201cThere have been multiple papers published after ours, and they\u2019ve found similar trends,\u201d Noble says.\nThese findings suggest we may be on the verge of a renaissance in how we define death. Recent breakthroughs certainly point in that direction. In 2019, researchers at Yale used a system called BrainEx to restore cellular and synaptic activity in pig brains four hours after death\u2014without restoring consciousness\u2014suggesting that death may not be a singular, irreversible moment. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Michigan observed surges of electrical activity in human brains following cardiac arrest, prompting new questions about what the brain is doing in its final moments.\nIn a 2024 BioEssays paper, Noble and Pozhitkov expanded on their original research, proposing that some dying cells may attempt to survive, transform, or even assemble entirely new structures. They liken the process to embryogenesis in reverse\u2014a biological un-becoming that replays life\u2019s opening act in reverse order. Consider the gravity of that claim: death, giving rise to life. But to Noble, it isn\u2019t far-fetched. He points to biologist Michael Levin\u2019s work as evidence that such cellular creativity may be part of life\u2019s deeper (and mysterious) playbook.\nLevin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University, showed that frog embryo cells can actively form new multicellular organisms\u2014called xenobots\u2014with behaviors never programmed into their original design.\n\u201cI would have never thought that you could take cells from a dead work\u2014like they took the frog eggs, and they completely blasted them. One would think that that blast would kill all the cells. But to think that the cells reassembled themselves and formed a multicellular beast\u2014organism\u2014I mean, that completely shocked me!\u201d Noble says. \u201cYou can inject drugs or other things inside these new organisms and reimplant them in your body,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd by doing that, you can perhaps heal them.\u201d Because these cells come from your own body, the immune system wouldn\u2019t reject them.\nBut there\u2019s a darker side: Noble found that many genes spring to life after death and link directly to both cancer suppression and cancer growth. That might explain why some organ transplant recipients are at higher cancer risk. \u201cWhen organs are transported from the donor to the receiver, those gene transcripts [copies of genetic instructions used to make proteins] could be activated,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because they\u2019re activated, they increase the chances of getting cancer.\u201d\nDespite all this, Noble remains in awe. \u201cWe used to think that when there\u2019s no brain activity or breathing, a person is dead,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are clearly stages to death\u2014cells can still be alive and doing things. Some may even grow.\u201d He adds: \u201cIf we look at certain vertebrates, or we look at frogs, or we look at tadpoles\u2014they go through different stages that they follow, right? Or let\u2019s look at caterpillars\u2014they have two forms, right? Life probably has that ability, but it\u2019s been [mysteriously] turned off in evolutionary development.\u201d\nThis growing body of evidence is beginning to rewrite our assumptions about death. If life can persist\u2014or even reorganize itself\u2014after clinical death, then what exactly does it mean to die? Perhaps this \u201ctwilight\u201d zone isn\u2019t an end point, but a hidden stage of life we\u2019ve only just begun to understand.\nFor Jessica McCarthy, Psy.D.\u2014a clinical neuropsychologist and founder at Elements Psychological Services, LLC\u2014that uncertainty isn\u2019t just biological. It reflects how poorly we understand the dying process. She compares death to a runner finishing a race\u2014\u201cJust because the finish line is crossed doesn\u2019t mean the body stops immediately,\u201d she says. \u201cThe body is still slowing down the processes that aided movement. But the race is over.\u201d\nMcCarthy believes redefining death will require more than hard science though. \u201cWe need to discuss not just the biological changes after death, but the psychological and cultural ones too,\u201d she says. \u201cHow do we prepare for death? Why do some people accept it while others fear it? How does dying change decision-making if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with something terminal?\u201d\nThat ambiguity only raises the stakes for scientists on the biological side. \u201cI would say that this [Noble and colleagues\u2019] type of study is much needed and long overdue,\u201d says Jimo Borjigin, Ph.D., associate professor of neurology and molecular and integrative physiology at the University of Michigan. She coauthored a breakthrough study in 2023 that found surges of gamma waves\u2014high-frequency brain oscillations often related to conscious perception and cognition\u2014in declining brains moments after clinical death. \u201cSince death is the ultimate disease we will all suffer, understanding how it occurs at all levels\u2014genetic, molecular, cellular, systemic\u2014is important. The more the better.\u201d\nMeanwhile, studies of patients in coma have uncovered the previously unimaginable: a surprisingly rich inner world, where some unresponsive individuals still show signs of awareness. That liminal \u201cthird state\u201d between life and death is both eerie and fascinating. Could someone mistakenly declared dead still be biologically salvageable? Could some trace of awareness persist in the brain?\nNoble doesn\u2019t go into \u201cspiritual or religious interpretations,\u201d but he confesses the findings have shaken him. \u201cI used to be a person who thought that death\u2014you know, you die and that\u2019s it. It\u2019d take one or two days for your cells to die, and that would be a gift. I didn\u2019t expect that some cells would actually start growing after you\u2019re dead. I wouldn\u2019t expect that some gene transcripts increase after you\u2019re dead.\u201d\nHe\u2019s retired now, with no lab and no funding. Despite his newfound questions, Noble has done his part. These days, he writes poetry. But if someone gave him half a million dollars to study death again? \u201cI might say yes,\u201d he laughs. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know what happens when an organism dies. This should be an important research goal: to aim to go and figure out what happens when you die.\u201d\nStav Dimitropoulos\u2019s science writing has appeared online or in print for the BBC, Discover, Scientific American, Nature, Science, Runner\u2019s World, The Daily Beast and others.

      "text": "Our minds are impressive biological machines, but like any machine, things can go awry. One of the biggest psychological spanners to be thrown into our brainworks is chronic stress. These prolonged periods of immense anxiety can bring about many negative psychological conditions.\nIt\u2019s precisely in these dark moments that \u201cmind-altering drugs\u201d\u2014often a derogatory phrase used in some circles to describe substances such as psilocybin and MDMA\u2014could actually be just what the doctor ordered. New evidence suggests that psychedelics could play a therapeutic role by rewiring how the brain and immune system communicate, and the research offers staggering empirical evidence of the healing capacity of these substances.\nThe journey toward this breakthrough began in the unlikeliest of places. When neuroscientist and immunologist Michael Wheeler worked years ago as an intern for a public defender in Baltimore. he became fascinated with the biological and environmental circumstances pushing people into legal troubles.\n\u201cI felt that the actions of the people we defended were so inextricably linked with their environmental circumstances, inclusive of physical or emotional abuse beyond their control, that I was desperate to understand the inner workings of their minds,\u201d said Wheeler in an interview with the Genomic Press.\nSo he decided to ditch law and instead pursued a Ph.D. in neuroscience, while also specializing in immunology during his post-doc. This multidisciplinary approach led to a publication in late April in the journal Nature on a fascinating connection between the brain and the immune system: psychedelic substances, such as MDMA and psilocybin, seemed to create a functional bridge between the two parts of the body.\nThe study found that astrocytes, a type of support cell in the amygdala\u2014the brain\u2019s emotion center\u2014has a specific type of brain receptor that limits stress-induced fear. But stress skews its operation, and in the end, the immune system gets involved, and things go haywire. \u201cWhen chronic stress disrupts this signaling, it leads to a cascade involving brain-resident cells and immune cells that ultimately increases fear behavior,\u201d Wheeler said in the interview. In other words, stress activates these fear-promoting cells.\n\u201cWhat is fascinating is that psychedelic compounds can reverse this entire process: they reduce the immune cell accumulation in the brain meninges [membranes that protect your brain],\u201d said Wheeler, who is now a faculty member at Boston\u2019s Gene Lay Institute of Immunology and Inflammation.\nResearchers observed another effect of chronic stress: inflammatory immune cells called monocytes\u2014which are involved in multiple inflammatory disorders\u2014also migrated to the meninges. The scientists think that using psychedelics for stress could have a therapeutic role in combating inflammatory diseases as well.\nOf course, the healing properties of psychedelics is nothing new. Evidence of humans using psychedelics is as old as history itself. Ancient peoples\u2014whether Ancient Greeks or pre-Inca civilizations\u2014regularly imbibed or ingested some form of mind-altering substances. Although psychedelic healing was seen as largely \u201cshamanistic\u201d for millennia, scientists reexamined their therapeutic usefulness in the 1950s and 60s. Psychedelic research bans in the U.S. and around the world delayed earlier breakthroughs by decades, though research in the area has steadily increased since the late 1990s. Today, a handful of U.S. states have legalized medically supervised uses of psilocybin, and Wheeler\u2019s work shows that these states might be onto something.\nThe paper in Nature details how these substances alleviate fear and inflammation in mice. However, it also found similar responses in human brain cells and gene expression in people experiencing major depressive disorder (MDD). Wheeler stresses that psychedelics aren\u2019t a magical cure-all for those suffering from chronic stress or inflammation, but that the \u201cshamanistic\u201d healing properties of the ancient past seem to have a significant level of scientific merit.\n\u201cOften, we think of mental health disorders based on their behavioral symptoms. However, we are likely leaving much underlying biology on the table by focusing solely on the brain,\u201d Wheeler said in the interview. \u201cI hope that this leads to a revolution in thinking about therapeutic agents to treat neuropsychiatric disorders.\u201d\nWheeler and his team are now conducting a clinical trial, in partnership with the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics, to analyze tissue samples of patients suffering from MDD. They hope to better understand the long-term effects of this type of psychedelic treatment.\nOnly in the last 80 years or have scientists and medical professionals begun to seriously examine the role of neurochemistry in mental disorders. If psychedelics prove to have the ability to reverse some of the most damaging mental side effects of chronic stress and depression, it could be an invaluable-yet-trippy therapeutic ally for the hundreds of millions struggling with mental illness around the world.\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our world works.

      "text": "It happened at a music festival in California in 2018. \u201cI think I was probably 28,\u201d says Daniel Toker, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \u201cIt was a festival\u2014it was called Lightning in a Bottle,\u201d Toker recalls. But for one person that night, the lightning disappeared. Someone full of life, just enjoying himself, was gone\u2014just like that. A young man who was dancing and having fun suddenly collapsed and died. The cause wasn\u2019t clear, only the suddenness. \u201cJust watching it happen to a young person, it really shook me up,\u201d Toker says.\nThough his Ph.D. had focused on perception and memory, not clinical care, the shock of seeing consciousness end so abruptly sent him deep into coma literature. After finishing his doctorate, he sought out a lab at UCLA that specializes in coma research. Years later, Toker is among the few scientists chasing a high-stakes goal: to understand how the lights go out in the human brain\u2014and how, just maybe, we can switch them back on.\nToker is pioneering new ways to understand and potentially reverse coma. He studies brain organoids\u2014miniature, lab-grown models of the human brain\u2014to simulate unconscious states. He also uses deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) to identify promising parts of the brain that might respond to treatment and help bring back awareness. And he analyzes electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from real patients to map how awareness reemerges across different unconscious states. These methods are still preclinical (researchers have tested them only in the lab, not yet in patients), but his early findings are drawing interest.\nOne of the most surprising discoveries from Toker\u2019s research is saxagliptin\u2014a diabetes drug in the same class as Ozempic and DPP-4 inhibitors (which preserve GLP-1, a hormone that controls blood sugar and appetite). His AI model first identified brain circuits that might respond to treatment\u2014and saxagliptin emerged as a top candidate for potentially restoring consciousness in some brain-injured patients. Then it matched those circuits to existing drugs. This reverse-engineering approach could radically change how scientists find new coma therapies.\nThe UCLA researcher\u2019s work builds on a now-famous body of work suggesting that patients diagnosed as unaware may still possess hidden awareness. Take the landmark 2010 New England Journal of Medicine study led by Martin Monti and Adrian Owen, in which vegetative patients were asked to imagine playing tennis during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. A few responded with the same brain activity as healthy volunteers\u2014evidence they were conscious but unable to move or speak. Or the August 2024 global trial that found that about 25 percent of patients who seemed totally unresponsive could actually follow commands using just brain activity, a condition known as cognitive motor dissociation.\nThese findings raise uncomfortable questions: How many patients might be aware, yet misdiagnosed? How many retain an unreachable awareness? And are we making the right calls when deciding to unplug comatose patients?\n\u201cWe have heuristics\u2014rules of thumb [to make these decisions]\u2014but yeah, it\u2019s almost certain that we\u2019ve unplugged people who would\u2019ve otherwise regained awareness,\u201d Toker says.\nThe line between life and death is ethical, clinical, and deeply confusing. A coma is often the first phase: eyes closed, no wakefulness or awareness, usually lasting days or weeks. If the brain doesn\u2019t recover, the patient may enter a vegetative state\u2014eyes open, with sleep-wake cycles, but still no signs of consciousness. Some patients move into a minimally conscious state, characterized by flickers of awareness: tracking a finger, occasionally responding to commands. It\u2019s fragile, inconsistent\u2014but a sign of hope.\nWhen recovery does happen, it\u2019s rarely dramatic. \u201cConsciousness is either on or off. But in a lot of these patients, there are elements of it that are there, and elements that aren\u2019t,\u201d says Toker. \u201cPatients who are vegetative might transition to a minimally conscious state\u2026 and have better odds of eventually fully waking up.\u201d\nHis novel approach is getting attention.\n\u201cUsing AI to come up with a new treatment, like the saxagliptin\u2026 I thought that was very elegant,\u201d says Olivia Gosseries, PhD, a neuropsychologist and director of the Coma Science Group at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, a leading center for research into coma and related states. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the first results. Because most of it is still at the theoretical level.\u201d\nGosseries\u2019s group is testing the two foundational approaches: pharmacological treatments (including psychedelics like ketamine and psilocybin) and brain stimulation, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). She believes we\u2019re seeing a major shift in how we define the contours of coma. \u201cNow, more than ever, more centers believe we can cure coma,\u201d Gosseries says, referencing the Curing Coma Campaign, the first global public health initiative that considers coma a treatable medical condition, launched by the Neurocritical Care Society in October 2019. Perhaps that\u2019s why she confidently emphasizes one crucial point: Don\u2019t assume unresponsive means unconscious. \u201cWe never really know if someone is conscious or not,\u201d she says.\nThose Hollywood scenes\u2014where desperate relatives sit beside the listless body of a loved one in a coma, speaking softly about quotidian matters, convinced their words might reach them\u2014may hold an instinctive truth now backed by science. \u201cBe careful what you say around the patient,\u201d Gosseries warns. \u201cThey might hear you even if they\u2019re not responding.\u201d\nShe also points out how patient wishes, often used to decide when to stop care, are not always a reliable index. Clinicians often assume the threshold is: full cognition, ability to walk\u2014high-functioning recovery, Gosseries says. But what we see from patients and families is different. Gosseries says her team is studying how patients who recover from severe brain injury reassess what makes life worth living. Before the injury, many said they would have rejected life with major disabilities. Afterward, she says, \u201cwe see something different,\u201d with some telling her team that \u201cjust being able to communicate is enough.\u201d This shift, she quickly adds, is why we need to move fast: \u201c...Because if you don\u2019t stimulate or wake up the brain early, the brain might get used to being in that state\u2014and then it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nBut how late is too late?\nFor Gosseries, brain death\u2014marked by the irreversible loss of brainstem reflexes (like pupil response to light or the gag reflex)\u2014is the medical definition of death. Once you cross that line, the door of return shuts down forever.\nToker, however, raises some trickier gray areas. \u201cSome types of drug overdoses can make someone appear completely brain-dead,\u201d he says. \u201cBut once the drug clears out, they wake up.\u201d One example is tricyclic antidepressants, an older class of drugs used to treat depression.\nEven more unsettling, Toker adds, is that the brain can still be electrically active [meaning neurons are still firing] yet somehow blocked from generating consciousness. \u201cDuring a seizure, for instance, the brain is very, very active, but something about the shape of the activity or the way it is propagating through the brain, isn\u2019t allowing consciousness to emerge,\u201d Toker says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that the brain is on or off,\u201d he stresses. What matters is the shape and complexity of the activity. Consciousness seems to arise when a certain large-scale network pattern emerges, he says, pointing toward a neuroscientific mystery we haven\u2019t fully cracked. Some kind of complex pattern has to emerge. \u201cAnd we exist, our experience exists somehow in that pattern,\u201d he says. Which means the lights may not be out. They may just be scrambled.\nStav Dimitropoulos\u2019s science writing has appeared online or in print for the BBC, Discover, Scientific American, Nature, Science, Runner\u2019s World, The Daily Beast and others.
