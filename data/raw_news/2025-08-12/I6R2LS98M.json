  "description": "Critics fear a U.N. Security Council resolution authored by France could leave a current system in place in southern Lebanon despite years of failures to curb Hezbollah.",
  "content": "FIRST ON FOX \u2014 The U.S. may allow a controversial draft United Nations Security Council resolution to pass that some critics say would help Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror organization.\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon\u2019s (UNIFIL) mandate is up for renewal at the end of August, and the French-authored text would buy the mission another year while also not giving a firm termination date, according to a draft obtained by Fox News Digital. However, it states that the ultimate goal is to have \"the Lebanese government [be] the sole provider of security in southern Lebanon\" as long as it \"fully controls all Lebanese territory.\"\n\nUS CHAMPIONS LEBANON'S RESPONSE TO HEZBOLLAH DISARMAMENT, HINTS AT ABRAHAM ACCORDS OPPORTUNITY\n\nWhile applauding the end of hostilities, it also takes aim at Israel for its moves against Hezbollah terrorists operating across its border, noting in the draft that it, \"Welcomes the cessation of hostilities arrangement between Israel and Lebanon of 26 November 2024 (S/2024/870), as a critical step towards full implementation of Resolution 1701, while noting with grave concerns the continuous violations of this arrangement, notably air and drone strikes on Lebanese territory, and requests the parties to faithfully implement its provisions, with the support of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon (UNSCOL) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in line with their respective mandates.\"\n\nThe draft also urges Israel to withdraw from its five remaining positions inside Lebanon, which Israel maintains are meant to counter Hezbollah. Israel would also be encouraged to take part in \"diplomatic efforts\" to delineate a border between itself and Lebanon. If the resolution were to pass in its current form, Lebanon would be responsible for manning the posts with the help of UNIFIL.\n\nAs part of its goal of clearing southern Lebanon of unauthorized armed personnel \u2014 primarily Hezbollah operatives \u2014 the resolution encourages the international community to back the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) so it can ensure the absence of armed factions between the Blue Line and the Litani River.\n\nFollowing the Second Lebanon War in 2006, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1701, which outlined that UNIFIL and LAF would work to block Hezbollah\u2019s activity in southern Lebanon. However, this has not been the case and critics fear that French draft would only bolster a system that has already failed.\n\nDECISION DAY APPROACHES FOR TRUMP ADMIN ON CONTROVERSIAL UN FORCE THAT FAILED TO DISARM HEZBOLLAH\n\nA senior policy analyst for the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) has voiced concern about renewing UNIFIL's mandate and called on the U.S. to veto it.\n\n\"UNIFIL has proven, over the course of decades, its failure to achieve any semblance of its stated purpose. UNIFIL was created in 1978, during the chaotic Lebanese Civil War, to try to stabilize Lebanon and prevent broader spillover,\" Yoni Tobin pointed out in an op-ed originally published by the Algemeiner. He also noted that UNIFIL has not acted against Hezbollah's building up its arsenal despite being given the green light to do so.\n\nIn the years since the resolution\u2019s passing, the terror organization has been active, with Israel uncovering networks of tunnels similar to those used by Hamas. Additionally, Hezbollah quickly joined in Hamas\u2019 war against Israel after the Oct. 7 massacre.\n\nUNIFIL IGNORED HEZBOLLAH TERROR BUILDUP FOR 18 YEARS, ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SAYS\n\n\"Among countless failures by the United Nations in the Middle East, UNIFIL may be the most spectacular. Tasked with ensuring that Hezbollah would not rearm after the 2006 war, it patiently watched as Hezbollah became the largest non-state terrorist and military organization in the world,\" the former U.S. Ambassador during the first Trump administration, David Friedman, told Fox News Digital in June. \"Stability in Lebanon \u2014 within reach only now that Israel has decapitated Hezbollah\u2019s leadership \u2014 will not be achieved through UNIFIL.\"\n\nIn October 2024, Fox News Digital reported that UNIFIL had failed to prevent Hezbollah\u2019s rapid rocket and weapons buildup since the mandate was implemented in 2006.\n\nPro-Hezbollah officials and soldiers within Lebanon\u2019s Army also remain a core problem, according to experts and media reports. In late January, a LAF chief reportedly sent a classified document to Hezbollah. The LAF\u2018s Suhil Bahij Gharb, who oversees military intelligence for southern Lebanon, secured the confidential material from a military facility run by the U.S., France and UNIFIL.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt remains unclear how the U.S. will vote on the resolution or whether it will seek revisions to the French-authored text.\n\nThe U.S. mission declined to comment, while the U.N. missions of Israel and France did not respond to Fox News Digital requests.",

      "text": "What to know about the State of Israel\nIsrael is a country in the Middle East predominantly composed of Jewish individuals. It is home to many holy sites and has deep religious roots dating back to biblical times. Bordered by Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, Israel is roughly the size of New Jersey.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, from the right-wing Likud party, is the longest-serving prime minister of Israel. He previously served as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and later from 2009 to 2021, before returning to the role in 2022.\nThe State of Israel was established in 1948 and was officially admitted to the United Nations (UN) in 1949. Israel has a long-standing conflict with Arab states and the Palestinians, characterized by years of violence and terrorist attacks against the Jewish state.\nOn Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a deadly attack on Israel, prompting Israel to formally declare war on Hamas. In June 2025, Israel launched strikes aimed at Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leaders. On June 13, 2025, Israel initiated strikes targeting nuclear sites in Iran, marking the beginning of fire exchanges between the two nations and the start of the Israel-Iran war. In retaliation for U.S. strikes against its nuclear program, Iran launched at least 14 missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. According to President Donald Trump, the United States carried out strikes on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Operation Midnight Hammer on June 22, 2025."

      "text": "The Middle East is rich in history, natural resources, and religion. With endless deserts, rugged mountains, and river valleys, the region offers unique wildlife and picturesque terrains. Within the Middle East lies the birthplace of major world religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam. With its vast oil supply and natural gas reserves fueling its economy, the Middle East is heavily relied upon internationally for its resources. Tourism is also an important factor in the Middle Eastern economy, with top tourist destinations including the Great Pyramids of Giza, Petra, Jerusalem, and Abu Dhabi in the UAE. However, some top tourist attractions have seen a decline in visitor numbers due to ongoing conflicts in different countries.\nJust as it has a long history, the Middle East has experienced a long line of conflicts both within and outside the region. Key conflicts occurring in the area include the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israel's war with the Hamas terrorist group, the ongoing rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and various other internal conflicts. Previously, the United States military fought wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The imposing threats of terrorism, drug smuggling, nuclear proliferation, and other factors have impacted the region's relationships both domestically and internationally. Major Middle Eastern leaders include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei."

      "text": "JERUSALEM\u2014The scandal-plagued U.N. mission set up to stop Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel will know in late August if the Trump administration plans to vote to discontinue its mandate at the U.N. Security Council.\nIn interviews with Fox News Digital, several leading American and Israeli experts on the mandate have called for the U.S. government to pull the plug on the mandate because the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is an example of the U.N.\u2019s ineffectiveness in stopping the Iran-backed Lebanese terrorist movement.\n\"Among countless failures by the United Nations in the Middle East, UNIFIL may be the most spectacular. Tasked with ensuring that Hezbollah would not rearm after the 2006 war, it patiently watched as Hezbollah became the largest non-state terrorist and military organization in the world. Stability in Lebanon \u2014 within reach only now that Israel has decapitated Hezbollah\u2019s leadership \u2014 will not be achieved through UNIFIL,\" the former U.S. Ambassador during the first Trump administration, David Friedman, told Fox News Digital.\nEXCLUSIVE: A LOOK AT HEZBOLLAH'S PLAN TO TERRORIZE AND INVADE NORTHERN ISRAEL\nAfter the conclusion of the Second Lebanon War in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, the UNSC passed Resolution 1701, which outlined that the international force UNIFIL, along with the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), was supposed to block Hezbollah\u2019s activity in southern Lebanon.\nHezbollah joined Hamas in its war on the Jewish state a day after the Iranian regime-backed terrorist organization in Gaza invaded Israel on October 7, 2023, and slaughtered over 1,200 people, including more than 40 Americans.\nIn October, Fox News Digital reported that UNIFIL soldiers had failed to stop Hezbollah\u2019s massive rocket and military weapons expansion since the mandate was implemented in 2006.\nIsrael\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon at the time accused UNIFIL of failing to enforce its mission to prevent the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah from establishing military outposts on the border with Israel.\nIsrael\u2019s incursion into southern Lebanon has revealed a military outpost about a mere 300 yards north of the border with the Jewish state that is filled with explosives and mines, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nISRAEL ORDERS IDF TO SEIZE MORE GAZA TERRITORY IF HAMAS DOESN'T RELEASE HOSTAGESWhen asked if Israel seeks an end of the UNIFIl mandate, Jonathan Harounoff, international spokesperson for Israel\u2019s Mission to the United Nations, told Fox News Digital this week that \"Israel is still evaluating the situation.\"\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that \"We have nothing to announce at this time\" about a vote against continuing the UNIFIL mandate.\nDr. Zoe Levornik and Sarit Zehavi, from the Israel Alma Research and Education Center\u2014one of the top think tanks assessing UNIFIL and Hezbollah\u2014wrote on the organization\u2019s webpage on June 10: \"Over the years, UNIFIL has had numerous opportunities to improve and fulfill its role, particularly in light of Israel\u2019s repeated warnings. Yet no real attempt has been made to alter the organization\u2019s conduct. There is no reason to believe that renewing the mandate\u2014even with improvements\u2014will bring about the necessary change that would make UNIFIL\u2019s presence in southern Lebanon relevant and effective in maintaining the security of both Israel and Lebanon.\"\nWhen confronted with the criticism from Alma about UNIFIL, the peacekeeping force's spokesman, Andrea Teneti, told Fox News Digital \"The LAF continues to benefit from UNIFIL\u2019s support\u2014not only to ensure full deployment in areas currently occupied by Israel, but also through training, capacity-building, and the development of essential capabilities needed to take over our mandated tasks on land and at sea.\n\"The mission\u2019s relevance remains vital in maintaining an impartial international presence on the ground, helping to monitor the situation and reinforce the efforts of the LAF. Additionally, UNIFIL is providing essential support to local communities during this particularly challenging period, contributing to stability in the area despite the numerous shelling monitored and reported since 27 November 2024.\"\nFREED ISRAELI HOSTAGE TELLS UN, 'NO MORE EXCUSES,' SAYS AID IS FEEDING TERRORISTS\nHe added \"Implementation of 1701 is not with UNIFIL but with the parties. We are supporting the parties in the implementation of the mandate, but commitment is needed from both sides. In recent months, during this new political environment, LAF and UNIFIL have been recovering a large number of ammunition caches as well as positions used previously by Hezbollah. The situation is more stable than earlier, but air strikes are continuing and the stability is still fragile.\"\nZehavi, who lives in northern Israel, where Hezbollah has caused severe destruction with missile fire, countered the UNIFIL spokesman's comments. She told Fox News Digital that all the things mentioned by UNIFIL \"are secondary to the primary issue of the mandate, which is the disarmament of Hezbollah.\"\nZehavi added that despite the UNIFIL spokesman claiming that UNIFIL seized ammunition used by Hezbollah, she noted that UNIFIL has provided no evidence. She asked \"in which towns\" Hezbollah is being disarmed. She stressed, \"Where are the pictures? How come there are no proofs and only statements that they are doing that? As a resident of the north, I want to see proofs to remind everybody that the IDF showed proofs of the arms of Hezbollah in south Lebanon and brought them into Israel.\"\nShe also asked where has UNIFIL been over the last 18 years in training the Lebanese army?\" I think the United States and France can do that better than UNIFIL,\" mentioning the new mechanism set up to address violations via U.S. and French Generals who are in the region, she said.\nZehavi said UNIFIL over the years \"tied our hands\" during the Israel-Hezbollah war.\nShe added that Israel is enforcing the disarming of Hezbollah via continued military strikes in the south. The Biden administration and France brokered a fragile ceasefire in November between Hezbollah and Israel. The language of the ceasefire states it aims to \"promote conditions for a permanent and comprehensive situation.\" The ceasefire ended 14 months of high-intensity warfare between Israel and Hezbollah.\nWhen asked about Zehavi\u2019s questions, Teneti said \"All our findings\u2014whether related to activities conducted with or without the Lebanese Armed Forces\u2014are shared with the members of the Security Council and also transmitted to the Mechanism, as agreed by both Lebanon and Israel. This is our authorized reporting line. Additionally, all detailed information is published quarterly in the Secretary-General\u2019s report on the implementation of Resolution 1701, which is a public document.\"\nPro-Hezbollah officials and soldiers within Lebanon\u2019s Army also remain a core problem, according to experts and media reports. In late January, a LAF chief reportedly sent a classified document to Hezbollah. The LAF\u2018s Suhil Bahij Gharb, who oversees military intelligence for southern Lebanon, secured the confidential material from a military facility run by the U.S., France and the U.N. interim force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe White House and the U.S. National Security Council did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital press queries."

      "text": "JERUSALEM \u2013 Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon on Sunday accused the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) of failing to enforce its mission to prevent the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah from establishing military outposts on the border with Israel.\nIsrael\u2019s incursion into southern Lebanon has revealed a military outpost about a mere 300 yards north of the border with the Jewish state that is filled with explosives and mines, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n\"Hezbollah terrorists are using UNIFIL outposts as hiding places and as places of ambushes. The U.N.'s insistence on keeping the UNIFIL soldiers in the line of fire is incomprehensible,\" said Danon.\nHEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: \u2018CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR\u2019\nHe added \"For 18 years, UNIFIL personnel ignored the Hezbollah bases along the border and did not report any Resolution 1701 violations, which states that only the Lebanese army is allowed to operate in the area.\"\nDanon continued that \"While the IDF is working against the terrorist organization Hezbollah, we requested that UNIFIL forces move five kilometers (approx 3.1 miles) north of the border in order to stay out of the line of fire. Unfortunately, at this time, this request has not been accepted.\"\nThe U.S. and other world powers passed Resolution 1701 at the United Nations Security Council in 2006 to aid the Lebanese Armed Forces in assuming military control over the region, replacing Hezbollah, between the Litani River and the southern border in Lebanon. The goal of the 2006 UNIFIL mandate was to prevent a third war between Israel and the U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hezbollah. Israel fought Hezbollah in 1982 and in the summer of 2006.\nHezbollah\u2019s decision to join Hamas\u2019 war on Israel a day after the Sunni terrorist movement Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7 revealed to Israeli war planners and counter-terrorism experts UNIFIL had failed its mission.\nHamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people in southern Israel on Oct. 7, including over 30 Americans. A lethal Hezbollah drone attack on Sunday murdered four IDF soldiers and wounded nearly 60 Israelis.\nHezbollah\u2019s massive military buildup of its presence on Israel\u2019s northern border since the 2006 war has caused an Israeli government re-examination of the clear and present danger of the Iranian-backed Shiite terrorist movement following Hamas\u2019 invasion of Israel\u2019s southern border on Oct. 7.\nISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS\nThe IDF said in a statement that \"Over the past month, approximately 25 rockets and missiles have been launched at Israeli communities and IDF troops from Hezbollah\u2019s terrorist compounds embedded near UNIFIL posts in southern Lebanon, exploiting their proximity to U.N. forces. One of the attacks resulted in the deaths of two IDF soldiers. Hezbollah uses compounds located above and below ground to carry out terrorist attacks against the State of Israel.\"\nUNIFIL issued a statement on Sunday, announcing, \"Early this morning, peacekeepers at a U.N. position in Ramyah observed three platoons of IDF soldiers crossing the Blue Line into Lebanon. At around 4:30 a.m., while peacekeepers were in shelters, two IDF Merkava tanks destroyed the position\u2019s main gate and forcibly entered the position. They requested multiple times that the base turn out its lights. The tanks left about 45 minutes later after UNIFIL protested through our liaison mechanism, saying that IDF presence was putting peacekeepers in danger.\"\nUNIFIL added \"peacekeepers at the same position reported the firing of several rounds 100 meters north, which emitted smoke. Despite putting on protective masks, fifteen peacekeepers suffered effects, including skin irritation and gastrointestinal reactions, after the smoke entered the camp. The peacekeepers are receiving treatment.\"\nDanon said \"The details of the incident involving UNIFIL soldiers in southern Lebanon are currently being investigated. In the coming days, we will continue to promote a dialogue on this issue with the relevant parties at the UN.\"\nWhen Fox News Digital approached UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti for a comment about Danon\u2019s criticism, Tenenti did not immediately respond.\nOver the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on UNIFIL to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon because they are being used as \"human shields\" to advance the Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah war machinery.\nSpeaking in Hebrew, Netanyahu told the U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, \"It is time for you to withdraw UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the areas of combat.\"\nSt\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general, said \"Against the backdrop of the ongoing hostilities in southern Lebanon and despite attacks that have hit United Nations positions, injuring a number of peacekeepers in the past several days, UNIFIL peacekeepers remain in all positions and the U.N. flag continues to fly.\"\nDujarric added that \"The Secretary-General reiterates that the safety and security of U.N. personnel and property must be guaranteed and that the inviolability of U.N. premises must be respected at all times without qualification. In a deeply worrying incident that occurred today, the entrance door of a U.N. position was deliberately breached by IDF armored vehicles.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe U.N. chief called \"on all parties, including the IDF, to refrain from any and all actions that put our peacekeepers at risk. The Secretary-General takes the opportunity to reiterate the call for a cessation of hostilities and the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701.\"\nGuterres did not address that the Hezbollah tunnel shafts discovered by the IDF were located a mere 300 feet away from a UNIFIL peacekeeping observation post, as well as the presence of other Hezbollah military installations in a zone that was required by UNSC 1701 to be free from Hezbollah explosives and armaments. The elaborate Hezbollah tunnels were found west of the Lebanese village of Labbouneh.\nThe United Nations Security Council will once again discuss the situation in Lebanon later on Monday."

      "text": "After 47 Years of Failure, It\u2019s Time to End UNIFIL\nError: Contact form not found.\nby Yoni Tobin\nThe United Nations certainly has a funny definition of the word \u201cinterim.\u201d\nForty-seven years after its creation, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is still around, despite clearly failing to fulfill its mission to restore peace to Lebanon\u2019s border with Israel. The United States should veto the Force\u2019s mandate renewal this month, and end the UNIFIL disaster.\nUNIFIL has proven, over the course of decades, its failure to achieve any semblance of its stated purpose. UNIFIL was created in 1978, during the chaotic Lebanese Civil War, to try to stabilize Lebanon and prevent broader spillover.\nHowever, even in peacetime, the force has suffered from the worst of the shortcomings associated with other UN peacekeeping forces around the world: inefficiency and unaccountability; serial inaction; and susceptibility to corruption. Though UNIFIL\u2019s political superiors deny it, a former UNIFIL commander admitted these realities.\nEven though UNIFIL saw its mandate strengthened by UN Security Council Resolution 1701 in the wake of the 2006 Second Lebanon War, its track record only got worse after the fact. Despite being granted permission by the UN to take \u201call necessary action\u201d to disarm Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL did nothing of the sort.\nWhen Israeli forces entered southern Lebanon in late 2024, they found Hezbollah weapons in roughly 1 in every 3 houses, and according to a former Israeli official, Israeli troops uncovered more anti-tank missiles in an average Lebanese village than in all of Gaza.\nDespite claiming to regularly patrol and act across southern Lebanon, UNIFIL passively allowed Hezbollah to evolve from a major threat to Israel, to a borderline existential one. With Iranian help, the terror group grew its arsenal from roughly 15,000 rockets and missiles in 2006, to approximately 150,000 in 2023.\nHezbollah increased its rocket arsenal tenfold, put many of these capabilities intentionally underneath civilian buildings, and built dozens of military bases along the Lebanon-Israel border \u2014 much of it in full view of UNIFIL facilities. UNIFIL, by its own account, was routinely stymied in its patrols by Hezbollah.\nUNIFIL cannot plead ignorance to its failure to counteract Hezbollah activity. According to Israeli officials, UNIFIL perpetually ignored Israel\u2019s specific requests \u2014 based on detailed intelligence on Hezbollah activity \u2014 to act.\nThis inaction explicitly contravened UNIFIL\u2019s mandate to maintain security and disarm non-state actors in southern Lebanon.\nThen, following Hezbollah joining Hamas in waging war on Israel in October 2023, UNIFIL\u2019s serial refusal to carry out its mission played right into Hezbollah\u2019s hands.\nUsing its classic human shield strategy, Hezbollah launched dozens of projectiles at Israel from within several hundred feet of UNIFIL facilities. By doing so, Hezbollah was able to directly complicate Israel\u2019s operations \u2014 given Israeli reluctance to risk hitting UN facilities \u2014 and coax the all-too-willing UN into rebuking Israel when it did operate against Hezbollah near UN posts.\nFurthermore, even the charitable view that UNIFIL\u2019s inaction was due to risk-aversion is increasingly in doubt.\nLast November, Hezbollah admitted that they bribed UNIFIL peacekeepers to gain access to UN facilities and equipment. This should perhaps come as little surprise given the force\u2019s composition \u2014 by even the narrowest definitions, as JINSA has noted, roughly one-third of its current contingent are peacekeepers from countries that routinely criticize or actively boycott Israel.\nWhy would anyone expect a peacekeeper from, say, Malaysia, to risk their life against Hezbollah?\nUNIFIL\u2019s perennial inaction causes another subtle, but significant, problem by preventing Lebanon from assuming full responsibility for its own security. With its current political leadership openly expressing a willingness \u2014 and its military increasingly demonstrating an ability \u2014 to crack down on Hezbollah, Lebanon should finally carry the counterterrorism baton in its own country. UNIFIL should simply get out of the way, and end the pretense that it\u2019s helping.\nIn UNIFIL\u2019s stead, the United States should work with partners and allies to strengthen the entity that can, and should, take primary responsibility for Lebanon\u2019s security: Lebanon. While working to rid the Lebanese military of any remnants of Hezbollah influence and infiltration, US and partner countries should work to build up the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF).\nThe LAF, newly emboldened from Israel\u2019s campaign against Hezbollah and Lebanon\u2019s new and improved political leadership, is making strides towards uprooting Hezbollah\u2019s terror activity nationwide. This progress, while still requiring close US oversight, carrots \u2014 and, if necessary, sticks \u2014 is encouraging.\nLike so many international agencies, UNIFIL is a weak entity with strong self-preservation instincts. That is why the United States should step in and do the job itself when UNIFIL comes up for its annual mandate renewal vote at the United Nations Security Council this month.\nYoni Tobin is a senior policy analyst at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA)."

The draft resolution aims to support the Lebanese Armed Forces in disarming unauthorized armed groups, primarily Hezbollah, while also urging Israel to withdraw from its positions in Lebanon. However, experts warn that UNIFIL has historically been ineffective, allowing Hezbollah to strengthen its arsenal significantly since the 2006 war, and some U.S. analysts are calling for the U.S. to veto the resolution to prevent further empowerment of the terror group.",
