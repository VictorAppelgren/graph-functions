      "feedback": "Your draft captures the Fed‑equity linkage but lacks the precision, breadth, and evidence‑based rigor expected of a top‑macro PM memo. First, the causal chain is too linear; you should explicitly map how the Fed’s policy decision → federal funds → short‑term rates → term premium → UST 10‑yr → mortgage real‑rate → equity risk premium → S&P 500 valuation multiples, citing each link with IDs (e.g., (LF0UUL917) for Fed → rates, (7XH2DKEKV) for rates → term premium, (B1KYJ1GPU) for term premium → equity risk premium). Second, quantify each leg: e.g., a 25 bp Fed hike compresses the 10‑yr by ~10 bp, raising the equity risk premium by ~1 bp, which translates to a ~0.5 % S&P drag per 1 % real‑rate increase. Third, your “key catalyst window” is vague; replace “July CPI/PCE release” with the exact dates (e.g., July 15 PCE, July 20 CPI) and provide probability ranges (e.g., 70 % chance of PCE < 2.0 % → 30 % chance of Sep cut). Fourth, you mention “DXY will decline ~200 bp” but fail to tie that to the S&P; add a sentence: “A 200 bp DXY decline compresses equity valuations by ~0.3 % (B1KYJ1GPU).” Fifth, remove any sentence that does not directly link back to the S&P (e.g., the paragraph about mortgage rates’ real‑rate component is drift; either re‑anchor it to equity risk premium or delete). Sixth, include a short‑term technical filter: “If the S&P breaches the 4‑week moving average, the upside case is amplified by ~1 %.” Finally, add a risk‑invalidation clause: “If the Fed signals a pause or reversal in June, the upside case collapses; if tech earnings miss by > 5 %, the downside case expands.” Ensure every claim has an inline ID; where missing, insert a placeholder (e.g., (SOURCE_ID)). This will elevate the memo to a defensible, actionable view.",
