      "feedback": "The draft shows strong macro-regime depth and cross-asset context, but it currently fails the SECTION FOCUS in three core ways: (1) it includes extra lines (a “Long 3–6 months” entry) beyond the required four movers; (2) the four movers do not strictly adhere to the 2 Up/2 Down requirement with consistent five-field formatting and explicit probabilities anchored to the material; and (3) the Swing Trade/Outlook plan is underdefined or misaligned with the data-rich material (no price-based entry/stop levels tied to the Ford fundamentals, and a potential mismatch between tradability and the plan type). To lift to world-class, execute a clean, first-principles, scenario-driven four-mover block and a tight Outlook, while tightening citations and numeric anchors. Concrete edits: replace the mover block with exactly four lines in this exact format: Up | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, with probabilities grounded in the material (e.g., 40%, 32%, 26%, 22%) and attach in-text IDs after each numeric claim (or after the line that asserts the number). Remove all nonessential lines (the extra Long line) and ensure each line cites the precise numbers from the provided sources (EV losses ≈ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%; ROIC ≈ 10.1%; forward P/E ≈ 10x; dividend yield ≈ 5%). Reconcile conflicts by selecting a single base macro Regime A for the backbone and treating Up lines as durable-margin/EV-scale inflections and Down lines as macro/regime shocks. For tradable content, provide a Swing Trade block only if you can anchor entries/stops/targets to live price levels or clear price-style triggers; otherwise convert to a concise Outlook line (Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence) limited to 1 line. In all four lines, ensure the “What to watch” reflects a crisp causal chain (EV scale → cost-down → margin durability → potential re-rating or ballast rotation) and include explicit invalidation rules (e.g., if EV losses persist beyond a threshold or macro regime shifts) with brief trigger signals. Finally, prune the cross‑asset clutter in the movers (keep only Ford-core inputs: 22PL3Q360; 65UUBU0OR; W2622L6WW) to avoid conflicting anchors, and deliver a tight, 4-line movers block plus a single 1-line Outlook/Swing Trade line that is honestly implementable given the data. If you keep sample lines, here is a compact, compliant template you can drop in (numbers and IDs shown for guidance): Up | 3–6 months | EV profitability inflection from scale and cost reductions; disciplined capex pacing within the $50B envelope through 2026 | watch durable EV margin progress; ROIC > cost of capital; tariff/policy signals | 40% (22PL3Q360)(65UUBU0OR); Down | 0–3 months | macro downturn/tariff intensification or persistent EV losses | watch macro trajectory and policy signals | 26% (65UUBU0OR)(22PL3Q360); Down | 3–6 months | AI leadership/macros shocks triggering ballast shift to IUSV/XLV | watch ETF-factor shifts and Russell vs S&P performance | 22% (4661GWFP7)(2YP1X9B4T)(Q7VVGNSQE); Up | 6–12 months | valuation re-rating toward income-led multiple (P/E ~10x, yield ~5%) as EV margins stabilize | watch durable EV-margin inflection and capex discipline | 32% (65UUBU0OR)(W2622L6WW)(22PL3Q360).",
