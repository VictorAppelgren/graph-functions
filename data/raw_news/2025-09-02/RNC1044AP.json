  "description": "Wall Street fell under the weight of pressure from the bond market",
  "content": "Trader Patrick Casey works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWall Street sank on Tuesday as rising pressure from the bond market pulled U.S. stocks further from their records.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.7% for its worst day in a month after paring a loss that earlier reached 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 249 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.8%. All three are still relatively close to their recently set all-time highs.\n\nBig Tech companies led the market lower. They\u2019ve been soaring for years on expectations that they\u2019ll continue to dominate the economy, but they have also shot so high that critics say their prices have become too expensive.\n\nNvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world\u2019s move into artificial-intelligence technology, fell 2% and was the single strongest force pulling the S&P 500 downward. Amazon sank 1.6%, and Apple dropped 1%.\n\nThe overall stock market felt pressure from rising yields in the bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.27% from 4.23% late Friday. When bonds are paying more in interest, investors are less willing to pay high prices for stocks.\n\nLonger-term bond yields are on the rise around the world, in part because of worries about how difficult it will be for governments to repay their growing mountains of debt.\n\nIn the United States, longer-term Treasury yields are feeling additional pressure from President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates sooner. The fear is that a less independent Fed will be less likely to make the unpopular decisions needed to keep inflation under control over the long term, such as keeping short-term rates higher than investors would like.\n\nTuesday was also the first opportunity for trading after a federal appeals court ruled late Friday that Trump overstepped his legal authority when announcing sweeping tariffs on almost every country on Earth, though it left the tariffs in place for now.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs have certainly created confusion across the global economy and may have hurt the U.S. job market. But less income from them could also force the U.S. government to borrow more to pay its bills, according to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nIn another signal of increasing worries in financial markets, the price of gold rose to touch another record. The metal has often provided a haven for investors in times of uncertainty.\n\nTreasury yields briefly trimmed their gains after a report on Tuesday said U.S. manufacturing shrank by more last month than economists expected. Many companies told the Institute for Supply Management that tariffs are continuing to make conditions chaotic.\n\n\u201cToo much uncertainty for us and our customers regarding tariffs and the U.S./global economy,\u201d one company in the chemical products industry said, while noting that orders across most product lines have weakened.\n\nThe worse-than-expected data on manufacturing could give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year at its next meeting in a couple of weeks. That\u2019s the widespread expectation among traders, though economic reports coming later this week could change things.\n\nThe highlight for the week is coming on Friday, when economists expect a report to show that U.S. employers upped their hiring by a bit last month. Last month\u2019s weaker-than-expected jobs report raised worries about the economy and cranked up expectations for coming cuts to rates by the Fed.\n\nOn Wall Street, Constellation Brands tumbled 6.6% after the beer, wine and spirits company warned that it\u2019s seen a slowdown in purchases of its high-end beers, particularly among its Hispanic customers. That pushed it to slash its forecast for profit this fiscal year.\n\nKraft Heinz fell 7% after announcing that it\u2019s splitting into two, a decade after a merger of the brands created one of the biggest food companies on the planet.\n\nOne of the companies will include shelf stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The other will include the Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables brands. The official names of the two companies will be released later.\n\nAmong the stock market\u2019s few gainers was PepsiCo, which rose 1.1% after an investment firm said it sent suggestions to the company\u2019s board to reaccelerate its growth and boost financial performance. The investor, Elliott Investment Management, has a history of buying into companies and pushing for big changes that can lead to better stock performance.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 44.72 points to 6,415.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 249.07 to 45,295.81, and the Nasdaq composite sank 175.92 to 21,279.63.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes slumped across Europe, with Germany\u2019s DAX losing 2.3%. That followed a more mixed finish in Asia, where indexes rose 0.9% in Seoul but fell 0.5% in Hong Kong.\n\nChoe writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "How can I ensure my family has easy access to short-term funds after I die?\n- Share via\nDear Liz: My friend died unexpectedly. I am helping her stepson, who is the successor trustee for her living trust, to get the estate settled. Her estranged son was a beneficiary on her main checking account and took the money as soon as she died, which was his right. However, it has taken three months for the stepson to gain access to her other funds in several brokerage accounts. In the meantime, it\u2019s been a challenge for him to pay the lawyer and burial expenses and keep the lights on in her house while he gets it ready for sale.\nI don\u2019t want my trustee to have that same problem. Is it better to put my checking account into the name of the trust, or is it better to name the trust as the beneficiary of the account? What\u2019s the best way to ensure my trustee has quick access to the short-term funds they will need?\nAnswer: Titling your checking account in the name of your living trust is generally a good idea, and should make it easier for your successor trustee to obtain control over the funds, says Jennifer Sawday, an estate planning attorney in Long Beach, Calif. After your death, the trust would still own the account; the original trustee \u2014 you \u2014 would simply be replaced by the successor trustee.\nThat said, some big national banks are notorious for dragging their heels on releasing funds when customers die, regardless of how the account is titled. If your bank makes it tough for you to retitle the account, that may be a sign that you need to search for a more customer-friendly institution. You may want to have a chat with your estate planning attorney, who can tell you which banks are problematic and which offer better customer service.\nSawday suggests her clients maintain at least two checking accounts, including one with a trust-friendly bank or credit union plus another at their brokerage, in addition to any accounts they have at a big national bank. That way, the trustee will have multiple options for accessing funds should any of the institutions prove problematic.\nDear Liz: I own a house with my longtime boyfriend. If one of us dies, how does the capital gains step-up affect the other?\nAnswer: The deceased partner\u2019s share of the home will get a new basis for tax purposes. The survivor\u2019s share will not.\nTax basis helps determine how much of a capital gains tax bill you might face when you sell a home or any other asset that gained value over time. Your basis is generally what you paid for the home, plus qualifying improvements.\nInherited assets typically get a step-up in tax basis to their current market value, which means that no one has to pay taxes on the appreciation that occurred during the original owner\u2019s lifetime.\nIf you were married and living in a community property state such as California, then the entire house could get stepped up to the current market value when the first spouse dies. This is known as the double step up. But this applies only to married couples in community property states. Unmarried couples in community property states and couples in other states don\u2019t get this benefit.\nDear Liz: I have retired early. I can keep my employer health insurance, thanks to COBRA, until I\u2019m 64 years and 9 months. Do you have any suggestions on how to bridge that 3-month healthcare gap while waiting for Medicare? I am relatively healthy, but things happen.\nAnswer: You shouldn\u2019t be without health insurance for a single day, if you can possibly avoid it. Fortunately, the Affordable Care Act exchange can help you bridge the gap.\nOnce you get the notice from your employer\u2019s health insurer that your COBRA coverage is ending, you can start your application at HealthCare.gov.\nLiz Weston, Certified Financial Planner\u00ae, is a personal finance columnist.

      "text": "Judge rules homeowner can probe State Farm claims practices\n- Share via\nPolicyholders critical of State Farm General\u2019s response to January\u2019s firestorms won a court victory this week when a judge ruled a Pacific Palisades homeowner can probe the insurer\u2019s claims handling practices during a rate hearing.\nIn doing so, Administrative Law Judge Karl Fredric Seligman denied a motion by the Department of Insurance to move an inquiry into the insurer\u2019s claims practices by Merritt Farren, whose home burned down, to a separate hearing after the rate increase is first considered.\n\u201cThe outcome could easily result in chaos and challenges ... on numerous grounds that would only operate to cause delay,\u201d the judge wrote of the department\u2019s motion in his Wednesday ruling.\nState Farm is seeking to raise its homeowner rates 11% after receiving an emergency 17% hike in May from Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, who adopted a decision by Seligman at the time that the insurer deserved the hike given its weak financial position even prior to the fires. State Farm also is seeking increases in other lines of property insurance.\nSix months after the Jan. 7 fire storms that killed at least 30 people, frustrations are mounting among many homeowners over how the state\u2019s largest insurer is handling their damage claims.\nThe insurer said this week it has received more than 13,000 claims and paid over $4.5 billion to policyholders. State Farm has said it expects claims payments to top $7 billion from the Jan. 7 fires, but losses under $700 million due to reinsurance agreements with its parent company. State Farm contends an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of its local policyholders are satisfied with its services.\nHowever, policyholders led by the Eaton Fire Survivors Network have demanded there should be no rate hike until hundreds of complaints over alleged payment delays, underpayments and claims denials are looked into and resolved \u2014 a position also voiced by area legislators at a news conference this week.\nAlso opposing the increase is Los Angeles advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, which says State Farm\u2019s possible total increase, including the 17% hike it already has received, would cost consumers $1.2 billion.\nFarren, 64, a former attorney for Disney and Amazon, was granted permission in July to participate in the rate hearing under a provision of Proposition 103, which regulates the industry and allows for public participation in rate hearings.\nHe said he was thankful for the judge\u2019s ruling this week, as well as a second decision that gave him time to seek documents from State Farm through the discovery process.\nState Farm, the largest home insurer in California, continues to seek approval of a 22% emergency rate hike even as it faces complaints over its handling of insurance claims.\nHe said any rate increases should be tied to the actual value homeowners receive from their policies, which crucially should include how their claims are handled. \u201cI think it\u2019s completely common sense and that it just really shouldn\u2019t be done any other way,\u201d Farren said.\nState Farm spokesperson Bob Devereux, in a statement said, \u201cWe thank the judge for the ruling on this matter, and we are looking forward to moving the rate hearing process forward toward conclusion later this year.\u201d\nThe Department of Insurance also said it looked forward to the rate hearing, which has been delayed and is now set for December.\nIn court filings, the department has argued that combining the two issues \u2014 the proposed rate increase and allegations the company has mishandled claims \u2014 could slow review of the rate request, which State Farm has said is critical to stabilize its finances.\nThe company\u2019s financial strength has been downgraded by ratings agencies, including S&P Global this month. However, the agency said it benefited from its strategic importance to its highly rated Bloomington, Ill., parent company.\nThe department also maintained that state law calls for handling claims issues through separate proceedings, including a market conduct exam of State Farm General\u2019s practices that Lara announced in June. It said a separate hearing would allow those findings when they are released to be considered with Farren\u2019s own probe of the issue.\nLegislators representing Altadena-area fire victims on Monday called on Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to crack down on insurers over how they are handling Jan. 7 fire claims and to freeze a rate hike requested by State Farm General.\nFarren said that while he lost his Mount Holyoke Drive home where he lived with this two sons, his request to look into claims practices wasn\u2019t driven by his personal experience with State Farm \u2014 which he deemed likely \u201cbetter than most\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but from what he heard from other policyholders.\nIn particular, he said he wants to look into the insurer\u2019s practices regarding payments for personal property losses and how it calculates building-cost estimates for reconstruction, as well as how it has handled claims for smoke-damaged houses. The insurer has been accused of being \u201cstingy\u201d in handling such claims.\nFarren said he has heard of situations in which State Farm has advanced payments for personal property coverage and then after receiving an itemized list of losses, has sought to offset what it has deemed overpayments from future payouts.\nMeanwhile, Palisades homeowners have received reconstruction cost estimates under $400 a square foot from State Farm, he alleged, when other insurers are issuing estimates of $800 to $1,200 per square foot.\nAfter the hearing, Joy Chen, chief executive of the Eaton Fire Survivors community group, issued an email to its more than 7,000 members, criticizing Lara for the department\u2019s legal position, saying Seligman had \u201csided with fairness.\u201d"

      "text": "How a Macy\u2019s parking structure became L.A.\u2019s latest luxury apartment complex\n- Share via\n- A former garage at the famous Westside Pavilion shopping center has given way to new housing.\n- Struggling indoor malls are being repurposed as shopping habits change.\n- UCLA is also building a research center on the site.\nAn unlikely corner of one of L.A.\u2019s once-famous/now-dead malls is open for business again this week as residents move into luxury apartments on the spot that used to be a Macy\u2019s parking lot.\nThe Westside Pavilion was one of the city\u2019s premier shopping venues and a cultural touchstone for generations of Angelenos, appearing in movies, television shows and music videos.\nBuilt on the site of California\u2019s first drive-in movie theater, the center played prominent roles in the 1995 film \u201cClueless\u201d and the video for musician Tom Petty\u2019s 1989 hit \u201cFree Fallin\u2019.\u201d\nBut like many other indoor malls, the Westside Pavilion fell out of favor in the 21st century before closing in 2019 to be converted to offices for rent.\nNow the former mall also has housing, which is even more in demand than offices these days. New residents will be allowed to start moving in this week.\nOn a spot once occupied by what the developer called an \u201cabsolutely horrible, obsolete\u201d parking structure, there are now 201 luxury apartments \u2014 a six-story complex that includes townhouses with front doors that open onto a residential street.\n\u201cYou have your own stoop,\u201d developer Lee Wagman said of the townhouses. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a brownstone.\u201d\nWagman is managing partner of GPI Cos., the Los Angeles real estate company that built the Overland & Ayres apartments and converted the mall\u2019s former Macy\u2019s building into the West End office complex. The combined cost of both builds was $350 million.\nWagman said the company got the temporary certificate of occupancy for the apartment complex just last week and move-ins can start as early as this week.\nThe former indoor mall will house two multidisciplinary UCLA centers focusing on immunology and immunotherapy as well as quantum science and engineering.\nThe rest of the former mall was in the process of being converted to offices for rent to Google when it was purchased last year by UCLA. The university is turning the old shopping center into a nearly 700,000-square-foot research center that will focus on immunology, quantum science and engineering.\nThe biomedical research center, which is set to open as early as next year, will be trying to tackle towering challenges such as curing cancer and preventing global pandemics.\nThe new apartments will be convenient for people working at the research center or other nearby job centers, such as UCLA in Westwood, Century City or Culver City.\nAs has grown more common for buildings competing at at the top of the apartment market, Overland & Ayres has amenities such as a gym with a resort-style pool deck and spa, an outdoor lawn for working out, a sauna and a cold plunge tub.\nIt has a large rooftop space with both indoor and outdoor lounging, dining areas and gas grills. There is a game room and two event kitchens. The building also includes an outdoor dog park and a spa for pets.\nServices available to tenants for a fee include personal training and private yoga instruction, dry cleaning pickup and delivery, car washing, dog walking, grocery delivery and housekeeping. Plans also call for commercial tenants along Overland Avenue that would serve the building, such as a restaurant or Pilates studio.\nRents range from $3,800 per month for a studio apartment to $8,500 per month for a townhouse.\nThe mall makeover is part of a decades-long trend of repurposing dead shopping centers, devastated by the pivot to online shopping.\nOnce the kings of retail, indoor shopping centers fell out of favor and lost customers to e-commerce, as well as outdoor \u201clifestyle\u201d centers \u2014 places such as the Grove and Westfield Century City, which feature fancy restaurants, entertainment and pleasant spaces to hang out, even if you\u2019re not buying anything.\nThe Sherman Oaks Galleria, a legendary indoor mall used in the filming of \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d and \u201cValley Girl,\u201d is now mostly offices.\nLakewood Center, one of the largest enclosed malls in Los Angeles County, spanning 2 million square feet, has been sold to developers who plan to transform it by adding housing, green spaces and entertainment venues.\n\u201cA lot of malls now are going towards mixed use,\u201d said Wagman, who helped turn an indoor mall in Pasadena into an outdoor mall with apartments more than two decades ago.\nWith downtown\u2019s office rental market mired in high vacancies and falling values, stakeholders are clamoring for more city support to convert high-rises to housing that would help address the city\u2019s persistent housing shortage.\nIt is not just old mall space. Struggling office buildings are also looking at transitioning to residences.\nWith downtown L.A.\u2019s office rental market struggling with high vacancies and falling values, stakeholders are lobbying for city support to convert high-rises to housing. The hope is that this could help address the city\u2019s persistent housing shortage.\nAmong the suggested targets for conversion are elite Financial District towers that commanded top rents before the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s stay-at-home orders shut down offices, leaving many buildings more than one-third vacant."
