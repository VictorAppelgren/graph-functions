  "content": "Lady Kitty Spencer was spotted soaking up the last of the summer sun with her mother and her rarely seen South African billionaire husband in Saint Tropez, France.\n\nPrince William and Harry\u2019s cousin, 34, enjoyed a laid-back day at the swanky Club 55 on Pampelonne Beach in Ramatuelle with her 66-year-old husband, Michael Lewis, and mom Victoria Aitken, 60.\n\nKitty, who has been married to Lewis for five years, held hands with her beau as they strolled to the beachfront restaurant for a lavish meal.\n\nFor the outing, Princess Diana\u2019s niece opted for a red, pink and white floral co-ord that featured a cropped bralette with a matching flowy skirt.\n\nShe topped off her summery look with a Dolce & Gabbana straw bag, sunglasses and minimal jewelry.\n\nAitken, for her part, looked chic in a white linen flowy dress, which she paired with an oversized white bag and a pair of blacked-out shades.\n\nLewis, meanwhile, opted for a light blue shirt, striped beach shorts and a pair of tan boat shoes.\n\nThe businessman, who is five years older than Kitty\u2019s father, Earl Spencer, married the model in July 2021.\n\nThe duo exchanged vows at the Villa Aldobrandini near Rome after having postponed their nuptials for two years due to the pandemic.\n\nThe exclusive three-day celebration was attended by a slew of celebs, royals and business honchos.\n\nThe couple went on to welcome their daughter, Athena, in April 2023.\n\nKitty has largely kept her personal life out of the spotlight and rarely posts photos of her husband on social media.\n\nThe pair had met through mutual friends in 2018, and struck up a romance the following year.\n\nStill, when it comes to her daughter, Kitty often shares sweet tributes on Instagram about the toddler.\n\n\u201cTwo years of you lighting up our world, my darling Athena,\u201d she wrote when her daughter turned two.\n\n\u201cYou are sunshine and joy and all things magic. My little girl forever. How proud I am to be your mummy. I love you more than you could ever imagine or I could ever articulate.\u201d\n\nThe touching post saw Athena\u2019s famous aunts, Lady Eliza and Lady Amelia, rush to the comments section at the time.\n\n\u201cHappy 2nd Birthday to my sweetest little love,\u201d they wrote. \u201cYou are my whole heart, and I love and cherish you more than you will ever know. Thank you for giving us the greatest gift @kitty.spencer.\u201d",

      "text": "Jack White melts down after White House calls him \u2018washed-up\u2019 \u2014 rages that Trump is a \u2018low-life fascist\u2019\nFormer White Stripes frontman Jack White scorned the Trump administration on Wednesday after the White House called him a \u201cwashed-up loser.\u201d\nIn a lengthy Instagram post, White retaliated against White House communications director Steven Cheung calling him a \u201chas-been\u201d with an anti-Trump screed that questioned President Donald Trump\u2019s humanity and called him a \u201cconman\u201d and a \u201clow life fascist.\u201d\n\u201cNo intelligent person can defend this low life fascist. This bankrupter of casinos. This failed seller of trump steaks, trump vodka, trump water, etc.,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cThis man and his goon squad have failed upwards for decades and have fleeced the American people over and over.\u201d\nThe \u201cSeven Nation Army\u201d singer\u2019s post came after Cheung slammed him for mocking Trump\u2019s new Oval Office decorations in a statement to The Daily Beast earlier this week.\n\u201cJack White is a washed-up, has-been loser posting drivel on social media because he clearly has ample time on his hands due to his stalled career,\u201d Cheung said Tuesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s apparent he\u2019s been masquerading as a real artist because he fails to appreciate, and quite frankly disrespects, the splendor and significance of the Oval Office inside of \u2018The People\u2019s House.\u2019\u201d\nCheung was responding to White, who began the tit-for-tat with an Instagram post Monday trashing the new gold decorations in the Oval Office.\n\u201cLook at how disgusting trump has transformed the historic White House. It\u2019s now a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler\u2019s dressing room,\u201d the musician said.\n\u201cCan\u2019t wait for the UFC match on the front lawn too, he\u2019s almost fully achieved the movie \u2018Idiocracy,\u2019\u201d he added, mentioning Trump\u2019s ambitions to host a UFC fight in front of the White House next year as part of America\u2019s 250th birthday celebrations.\nThough White started the feud with the administration, his response to Cheung accused the Trump team of being thin-skinned.\n\u201cHow petty and pathetic and thin skinned could this administration get? \u2018Masquerading as a real artist?\u2019 Thank you for giving me my tombstone engraving! Well here\u2019s my opinion, trump is masquerading as a human being.\u201d\nThe artist continued with a full second page of text slamming the US leader.\n\u201cHe\u2019s masquerading as a Christian, as a leader, as a person with actual empathy,\u201d White said, elsewhere blasting Trump\u2019s officials, Cheung and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\u201cHis staff of professional liar toadies like Steven Cheung and Karoline Leavitt have been covering up and masking his fascism as patriotism and fomenting hatred and division in this country on a daily basis,\u201d he said.\nIn addition to two full pages of gripes against Trump in the social media post, White included a lengthy caption.\n\u201cI don\u2019t always state publicly my political opinions, and like anyone I don\u2019t always know all of the facts, but when it comes to this man and this administration. I\u2019m not going to be like one of the silent minority of 1930\u2019s Germany. This man is a danger to not just America but the entire world and that\u2019s not an exaggeration, he\u2019s dismantling democracy and endangering the planet on a daily basis, and we. all. know. it.\u201d he said.\nCheung responded to White\u2019s Instagram post, telling Fox News Digital, \u201cTrump Deranged liberals like him are so predictable and easily triggered. I\u2019m glad we live rent-free in his rotted, pea-sized brain.\u201d"

Link to store in bio.\u201d\nSocial media users flooded his comment section, claiming they\u2019re grateful that he\u2019s alive.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep scaring me like this,\u201d one Instagram user commented.\n\u201cDang, we all really thought the same thing here didn\u2019t we?\u201d another asked.\nThe photo was posted on Daniels\u2019 Facebook, Instagram and X pages.\n\u201cI hate the fact that every time I see these posts, my heart drops,\u201d a commenter wrote.\nDaniels portrayed the popular mentor to characters like Cory, Topanga, Shawn and Eric in the coming-of-age show that followed their journey from sixth grade through college.\nThe ABC series, which starred Daniels, Ben Savage, Rider Strong and Danielle Fishel, aired from 1993 to 2000.\nThe sitcom star has yet to respond to the fans who filled his comment section with appreciation posts after they jumped to conclusions about his demise.\nWhile \u201cBoy Meets World\u201d fans know him as Mr. Feeny, Daniels had a decades-long career well before taking to the classroom.\nThe \u201cSt. Elsewhere\u201d actor made his television debut in 1943 at 16 years old by performing in a variety act.\nHe received his first \u201cmajor\u201d television role over two decades later in the 1967 show \u201cCaptain Nice.\u201d\nDaniels turned 98 on March 31 and shared that he\u2019s thankful for all of the support he\u2019s received over his career.\n\u201cWell, you have to be pleased, and I certainly am,\u201d he told People one day after his birthday. \u201cAnd I hope I\u2019m around a little longer, and we\u2019ll do it again next year.\u201d\n\u201cThe Graduate\u201d actor still tries to get \u201csome exercise\u201d on a daily basis, his wife, Bonnie Bartlett Daniels, revealed to People.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very strong,\u201d his wife said. \u201cHis body is very strong, even now. So I just want him to keep it strong by exercising. We have a gal who comes in twice a week and puts us through a kind of routine.\u201d"

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

      "text": "John Stamos can\u2019t \u2018bear losing\u2019 Dave Coulier in wake of cancer battle after Bob Saget\u2019s death\nEverywhere Dave Coulier looks, there\u2019s his \u201cFull House\u201d family ready to support him.\nJohn Stamos, who starred with the comedian, 65, on the ABC sitcom for eight seasons, has been by his former co-star\u2019s side since his 2024 cancer diagnosis.\n\u201cDave and I talk a lot,\u201d the \u201cGeneral Hospital\u201d alum, 62, told Us Weekly in an interview published Wednesday. \u201cYou know, we lost Bob [Saget], and I couldn\u2019t bear losing Dave, so I\u2019ve been with him a lot during this cancer journey of his.\u201d\nAfter being diagnosed with stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma last year, Coulier is now \u201c100% back to Dave.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see that the treatments work,\u201d Stamos continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s great to see him out there talking about it, to help other people that are going through the same thing.\u201d\nCoulier shared his diagnosis in November 2024.\nThe \u201cFuller House\u201d star appeared on \u201cToday\u201d and explained that he first noticed his symptoms when he got a cold, and then spotted a large lump in his groin.\n\u201cIt swelled up immediately,\u201d recounted Coulier. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m either really sick, or my body\u2019s really reacting to something.\u2019 \u201d\nThe diagnosis was a complete shock to the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Funniest People\u201d host.\n\u201cThe first thing I said to them was, \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 cancer?\u2019 \u201d Coulier recalled. \u201c[I was] feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else.\u201d\nDuring his cancer treatments, Stamos showed his support by wearing a bald cap.\nThe \u201cBig Shot\u201d actor posted three Instagram photos in November that showed him wearing the cap with Coulier, who had shaved his head.\nStamos received backlash for the move, but Coulier was quick to come to his longtime pal\u2019s defense.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to see a bunch of negative comments as I\u2019ve just begun my cancer journey,\u201d he wrote in an Instagram statement at the time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our friendship (me and John) and this is how we are handling a very tough time,\u201d Coulier continued. \u201cI\u2019m a comedian and humor is what drives me. John knows how to cheer me up and I laughed out loud when he arrived wearing a bald cap \u2014 being a true loving friend and brother.\u201d\nFive months later, the star shared that he was in remission after a biopsy confirmed he was cancer-free.\n\u201cOne of the few times in my life when \u2018zero\u2019 has been a great number to hear,\u201d Coulier told Parade in March.\nOn the same day as receiving a clean bill of health, the Hollywood vet learned that he had become a grandfather.\n\u201cI got the good news the day the baby was born,\u201d Coulier said while on an episode of the \u201cHow Rude, Tanneritos!\u201d podcast in April. \u201cSo I heard the news and I was so excited, and then Luc called us and he said, \u2018Hey, the baby just was born.\u2019 And so, I mean, it was an amazing day.\u201d\nThe comic\u2019s son, Luc, welcomed his baby boy, Chance Lee, with his wife, Alex, on March 27, per People.\n\u201cIt was really amazing, you know?\u201d Coulier gushed. \u201cSo we were like, \u2018Oh, this is just too much!\u2019 \u201d\nThe \u201cReal Ghostbusters\u201d vet starred on \u201cFull House\u201d from 1987 to 1995 alongside Stamos, Bob Saget, Lori Loughlin, Candace Cameron Bure, Jodi Sweetin and Andrea Barber.\nSaget died at 65 in 2022 due to blunt head trauma.\nIn October 2022, Stamos shed light onto his best friend\u2019s passing.\n\u201cWhen Bob died, one of the things that broke my heart the most was that there was a tsunami of love for him, but he didn\u2019t see it,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI know he didn\u2019t realize how loved he was. He was very insecure. He wasn\u2019t where he wanted to be in his career.\u201d\nIn September 2024, Coulier revealed how the remaining cast members keep their late co-star\u2019s memory alive.\n\u201cWe talk about all the fun times we had,\u201d he told Us. \u201cYou can either look at it as an empty well or you can keep filling that well up with great memories. And we have millions of memories that we can keep filling the well up with. And that\u2019s what we do.\u201d\nTwo months later, Bure, 49, shared one very important piece of wisdom she learned from Saget.\n\u201cI try to remember to tell all the people I love that I love them every time I see them,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cTell the people that you love that you love them. Don\u2019t leave the room without it.\u201d\nBure added, \u201cI try to laugh a lot.\u201d\nAnd the late star is never far from the podcast host\u2019s mind.\n\u201cI miss Bob every day, so I am happy to be here and champion the cause and celebrate him as well,\u201d stated Bure."

The billionaire is five years older than her father.\nThe engagement is doubly special for the Spencer sisters, as Millerd and Mallett are longtime friends after attending school together.\n\u201cWe played a lot of the same sports, like rugby and water polo, and naturally shared a lot of the same interests,\u201d Mallett told the outlet.\n\u201cMore than that, we share the same values \u2014 loyalty, ambition, integrity and a strong sense of family \u2014 which has kept our bond strong over the years,\u201d he said, adding that Millerd is one of his \u201cbest and closest friends.\u201d\nThe Spencer sisters also have a younger brother, Louis, Viscount Althorp.\nDespite being the youngest of the family, the 31-year-old will be inheriting the Spencer family seat and Althorp estate \u2014 childhood home of Princess Diana."
