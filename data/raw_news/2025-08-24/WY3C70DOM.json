  "content": "\u2022 Significant control over Coca-Cola HBC by retail investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions\n\u2022 52% of the business is held by the top 4 shareholders\n\u2022 Insiders have been selling lately This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality. Every investor in Coca-Cola HBC AG (LON:CCH) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 31% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And private companies on the other hand have a 23% ownership in the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola HBC, beginning with the chart below. What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola HBC? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Coca-Cola HBC. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola HBC's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Coca-Cola HBC is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Torval Investment Corp., with ownership of 23%. The Coca-Cola Company is the second largest shareholder owning 22% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock. Our research also brought to light the fact that roughly 52% of the company is controlled by the top 4 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Coca-Cola HBC AG. Insiders own UK\u00a3251m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 31% stake in Coca-Cola HBC. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 23%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company. Public companies currently own 22% of Coca-Cola HBC stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

  "argos_summary": "Coca\u2011Cola HBC AG\u2019s ownership is heavily concentrated, with 52% controlled by the top four shareholders, while retail investors hold the largest single block at 31%, giving the public significant influence over governance. Insider activity has been predominantly sales in the past three months, and institutional investors own about 22% of the shares, indicating a cautious stance. Financially the company shows solid past performance (5\u2011year return 95%) but modest future growth forecasts (earnings growth 8.4% and revenue growth 6.2%). The stock trades near its 52\u2011week high with a beta of 0.72, suggesting moderate volatility and a valuation score of 4/6. Overall, the company offers stable dividends and a strong market presence, but investors should monitor insider selling and the limited upside in growth projections.",
