  "description": "James Martin made a return to Saturday Morning this weekend with a brand new series.",
  "content": "James Martin announced some \"big news\" on Saturday morning as the TV chef returned to his ITV cooking show. James and the Saturday Morning crew have taken a long summer break and have enjoyed some much-needed time off. At the beginning of June, James bid farewell to viewers after he confirmed he was taking a break from filming. \"That is also it for the series. Me and the crew are heading off on sunny holidays. Different climates.\" As he explained, he would be spending his break in Yorkshire. James added, \"But we will be back here with more top chefs, other brilliant guests, and more delicious recipes later on in the year. \"Until then, thanks for watching. Have a wonderful, fantastic summer. I'll see you out there wherever you are. Thanks for watching, see you again soon, goodbye for now.\" However, the TV star was happy to be back this weekend as he welcomed Dead Ringers stars Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens, and Peter Wright from The Yorkshire Vet onto the show.\n\nAfter introducing his guests, James paused the show to tell viewers he had some \"big news\". He shared: \"Now that's not all, because we're kicking off the series with a bang, as we're joined by two legends of the food world who are both welcome round to my house anytime they like. \"I don't think they have left since the last series. It's Lesley Waters and Atul Kochhar.\" He continued: \"Big news, big news as well. We are nominated thanks to you guys, and thanks to you for watching for an NTA. \"We are shortlisted... the Final Four. So get voting for us if you can, please as well.\"\n\nJames took to his Instagram account earlier this month to share the news that Saturday Morning had been shortlisted for an NTA. \"Wow, what news! You have shortlisted the show to the final 4 fave shows on daytime at this year\u2019s NTAs,\" the TV chef penned. \"Thank you on behalf of the team here and if you have a moment please vote! First time in 32 years on TV we have been on the list. Thank you again and thanks for voting! Link in story and bio!\" James Martin's Saturday Morning is available to watch on ITVX.",
