  "content": "Liverpool head coach Arne Slot says Jeremie Frimpong\u2019s ability to deputise for Mohamed Salah was one of the reasons the club signed him from Bayer Leverkusen this summer.\n\nWith Conor Bradley a major fitness doubt for Sunday\u2019s Community Shield against Crystal Palace, the \u00a329.5million signing is expected to start at right-back at Wembley.\n\nHowever, Slot also sees Frimpong as having a role to play further forward this season, especially when Salah is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt in December and January.\n\n\u201cWe definitely thought about that (Salah being away at AFCON),\u201d Slot said.\n\n\u201cWe brought in Jeremie Frimpong because we think he can play as a right full-back, but I also feel that he can play as a right winger. We will miss Mo for a maximum of six games, but that\u2019s quite a lot in the Premier League, especially when you see how well he did last season.\n\n\u201cSigning Jeremie was for multiple reasons but one of them was that he could replace Mo if Mo is not there. There are other options as well but Jeremie is definitely one of them.\u201d\n\nSlot refused to be drawn on Liverpool\u2019s pursuit of Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak as the club eye a replacement for Darwin Nunez, who is close to joining Saudi Pro League outfit Al Hilal for around \u00a346m. The Sweden international remains the club\u2019s top target after a \u00a3110m bid was rejected last week.\n\n\u201cAs you know from me and I think every manager works like this, you don\u2019t talk about players who aren\u2019t yours,\u201d Slot said.\n\n\u201cI can talk to you about Hugo (Ekitike), who we signed recently. He\u2019s done really well until now. We are really happy with the squad we\u2019ve got. Players have left but we\u2019ve brought players in as well and the youngsters are doing well. Darwin might leave indeed but things are not signed yet. You need to wait a few days before that\u2019s completely done.\u201d\n\nTeenage winger Rio Ngumoha, who has lit up the friendly matches, has played his way into Slot\u2019s plans for the season ahead and the Dutchman insists he\u2019s happy with the depth of talent in the squad.\n\n\u201cRio showed in the last few games he played for us that at senior level he can have an impact as well,\u201d Slot added.\n\n\u201cWe think we already have a lot of attacking power in our team. When I think about Cody Gakpo, Federico Chiesa, Hugo Ekitike, Mo Salah, Jeremie Frimpong, who can play as a right winger, Florian Wirtz, who can play as a left winger. I feel that I already have lot of attacking options, but as a club we are always looking at opportunities in the market.\u201d\n\nCaptain Virgil van Dijk and Alisson are back in contention for Sunday\u2019s game against Palace but Joe Gomez (Achilles) remains sidelined.\n\nSlot is still managing Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s game time after the midfielder missed the start of pre-season.\n\n\u201cAlexis will be in the squad,\u201d Slot said. \u201cHe was out for two months I think or longer. He trained with us since a week now, played 30 minutes, 45 minutes. Starting is possible but definitely not for 90 minutes.\u201d",

      "text": "Jeremie Frimpong\u2019s first taste of life in England was not easy.\nHe was six years old when he came to live in a council house in Moston, a suburb north-east of Manchester. He came with his brothers and sisters \u2014 he is the fifth of seven children \u2014 and mother Bernice, who had recently separated from Jeremie\u2019s father, Jeffrey.\nAdvertisement\nIt must have felt a long way from Amsterdam, the Dutch capital where he had grown up. He borrowed boots and hitched lifts to play for local club Clayton, all the while motivated by incentives from his big brother, also called Jeffrey.\nLiverpool were interested in offering him a trial back then, but the distance from his home was an obstacle so it was Manchester City \u2014 who had scouted him as a prolific nine-year-old striker \u2014 who won the race to sign him, almost by default.\nNow 15 years later, Liverpool have finally got their man, having triggered a \u20ac35million (\u00a329.6m;$39.3m) release clause \u2014 a modest sum that made the deal even more appealing to Anfield executives \u2014 to bring the attacking right-back to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen on a five-year deal.\nFrimpong always envisaged another crack at football in England and returns as an elite talent: a league title winner in two countries, a senior Dutch international and the man carrying the family name with pride.\nWhen the 24-year-old made history as part of Bayern Leverkusen\u2019s Bundesliga-winning side last year after joining in 2021 from Celtic, he told those in his inner circle his success was only made possible by their input. The same message follows his move to Anfield and his infectious personality will soon be felt in a new dressing room.\nThe Athletic has spoken to multiple sources, some of whom wish to remain anonymous to protect their positions, to understand how Frimpong became one of Europe\u2019s most coveted talents and who, exactly, Liverpool are signing.\nIt is a footballer origin story that veers dangerously close to cliche \u2014 the kid so besotted with the sport that he once sent an errant shot into the front room and smashed the television.\nIn Frimpong\u2019s case, however, the anecdote is true and not surprising to anyone who knew him as a child growing up kicking \u201canything that resembled a football\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nEvery Saturday he would turn out for Clayton in the morning and nearby Clayton Villa in the afternoon, scoring regularly for both teams and showing off his explosive pace.\n\u201cHe drifted past players like they weren\u2019t even there,\u201d coach Paul Sneddon told The Athletic in 2020, adding that a running joke between parents and other observers was that he was too fast for his own body so he would often collapse onto the turf simply by losing his balance.\n\u201cI think he scored 50 goals in his second season with us but he would have scored 100 if he didn\u2019t fall over,\u201d Sneddon said. \u201cBut it was clear from the start that he had the natural ability to go on to greater things.\u201d\nMoving to City was the big breakthrough. Geography ruled out Liverpool, Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers. Instead, Bernice would jump on three buses in between working two jobs as a cleaner, to make sure Jeremie got to City training at their old Carrington headquarters \u2014 located on the other side of Manchester \u2014 on time.\nInitially there was some scepticism over whether Frimpong would make it at the top level. Some wondered whether he was too small, even as a right midfielder, but when he needed to impress as he stepped up from the \u201cshadow team\u201d into the academy, the player nicknamed \u201cSpeedy Gonzales\u201d by some of City\u2019s senior players put in performances that could not be ignored.\nHis brother, Aaron, was a significant figure at the time, helping him get where he needed to be as Jeffrey and Bernice were called away on work commitments. Jeremie was promoted rapidly through the City youth teams, winning a trophy with the under-18s and making the squad for FA Youth Cup finals in 2017 and 2019.\n\u201cHe was excellent and probably the fastest player I\u2019ve ever coached,\u201d Paul Harsley, who was the Under-23 team coach at City between 2018-2020, tells The Athletic.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe was so versatile and if ever he was caught out of position, his speed would help him recover and then flying forward he was also a massive asset.\u201d\nLate in 2018, the Netherlands sent representatives to watch a number of City\u2019s Dutch players in the under-23s. The country\u2019s under-19 coach and former goalkeeper, Maarten Stekelenburg, visited to watch two other City youngsters, Rodney Kongolo and Javairo Dilrosun, but the club\u2019s academy director, Jason Wilcox \u2014 now the technical director of Manchester United \u2014 said Frimpong was also eligible and should be considered.\n\u201cIt was just before the scouting data systems were fully up and running so we didn\u2019t know that he had both a Ghanaian and Dutch passport,\u201d Stekelenburg tells The Athletic. \u201cStraight away I found him interesting. I loved his character and his energy. He was a guy who was very friendly and open-minded, which is fantastic for a coach. He was also very fast. Not very composed, initially, but a great player to have in the team.\u201d\nFrimpong had clear talent but at right-back he was behind Lutsharel Geertruida and his future Leverkusen team-mate Timothy Fosu-Mensah, who later joined Manchester United, in the Dutch under-19 set up.\nThe right-winger, Mohamed Ihattaren, carried the most hope for that particular age group and further restricted his pathway. Frimpong was also hampered by his inability to speak Dutch, so coaches had to spend a little extra time relaying tactical instructions even though most of his team-mates helped translate into English.\n\u201cMany of the players had started with the national team at a younger age and even though we had a good group, you have to be a strong character to survive,\u201d Stekelenburg adds. \u201cJeremie was never lost in the group, though. He\u2019s not shy and he easily adapts to a new environment.\u201d\nFrimpong\u2019s strong Christian faith quickly helped him connect with other like-minded players in the team. In times of struggle in his earlier years the church was a big support to the player and his family. It was often an escape from the struggles of everyday life and in the good times that have since followed, those tougher times have never been forgotten.\nBlessed to be handed the opportunity to feature in City\u2019s academy teams, Frimpong was still one of many players who never played a minute in the first team. The closest he came was a handful of appearances in the EFL Trophy, where he played for City\u2019s under-21s.\nInstead, his first taste of senior football came in Scotland. Celtic became aware of his availability when the former Reading and West Bromwich Albion technical director, Nick Hammond, joined the Glasgow club in a recruitment consultancy role and eventually became head of football operations, overseeing all transfers. Hammond spoke at length with Andy Thorn, the former Wimbledon, Newcastle United and Crystal Palace centre-back who was scouting for Celtic at the time and passionately endorsed the move. Celtic played City in a pre-season friendly game and the manager Neil Lennon, who had been pre-warned about the interest, was immediately impressed.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI remember Lennon coming over to me and asking about Jezza,\u201d Harsley recalls. \u201cHe was doing his thing, playing well, and had been training, like many of the others, with the first team from time to time. Moving to Celtic when he did was perfect and helped him really take off.\u201d\nFrimpong duly signed a four-year contract in September 2019. Club officials can remember the way that he looked up at the stadium with wide-eyed excitement when he joined.\nCeltic\u2019s strategy of signing young players from reputable English academies was a risk, but Frimpong became the stand-out success story. He was supposed to supplement the squad as back-up in his first season but instead became a leading force, helping Celtic win a domestic treble.\nHis numbers were not astronomical \u2014 in the space of 18 months he set up eight goals and scored three himself \u2014 but arguably more significant was how he won the respect of senior players such as the captain, Scott Brown, through his performances and intensity in training.\nIn his first taste of senior football it became clear that pace and recovery speed would set him up well for a career as a versatile right-back. He learned how to become efficient in attacking areas by not over-playing and listened carefully to instructions on how to improve.\nSome people who worked at Celtic felt he was a little immature for his age, but his kind and genuine nature won many admirers off the pitch and again he had no trouble settling into a new group.\nMidway through his second season, it was already clear that Frimpong was unlikely to be extending his stay in Scotland. Bayer Leverkusen made their interest known and secured him for \u00a311.5m in the January 2021 transfer window. It represented a healthy profit on the modest \u00a3350,000 fee Celtic had paid to Manchester City, which on the face of it represented fantastic business. However some figures connected to the club still felt it was too low given his potential to improve.\nAdvertisement\nIt is easy to say they were right now, given Frimpong\u2019s subsequent achievements, yet Celtic cashed in when they recognised he was already focusing on the next stage of his career at a club in one of Europe\u2019s top five leagues.\nFull backs rarely move from the Scottish Premiership for such transfer fees and Celtic will also receive a significant windfall of up to \u00a36million from his switch from Leverkusen to Liverpool, having inserted a clause to receive a percentage of the profit on his next move.\nLeverkusen mapped out a pathway for his future, explaining how he could become a regular international through his performances in the Bundesliga. There was a focus on building a young and hungry team capable of returning to the Champions League after a season out of it and, although Frimpong only played 10 league games in his first half-season, the team qualified for Europe\u2019s elite competition by finishing third.\nTwo years later, and under the guidance of manager Xabi Alonso, who Frimpong says \u201calways knew how to use my abilities\u201d, he was a key member of the title-winning team and became one of the most in-demand right-backs in Europe, with 14 goals and 12 assists in 47 appearances across all competitions.\nNo longer a newbie but now an established fixture and the heartbeat of all off-field activities \u2014 he regularly welcomed team-mates to his home and organised other social events \u2014 it felt like all the hard work had paid off.\nEnding Bayern Munich\u2019s 11-year title reign and completing the mission with a series of vital stoppage-time strikes only added to the emotion. To become a record-breaker at such a young age and rid the club of their \u201cNeverkusen\u201d tag with a first league title in their 120-year history was overwhelming and stirred memories from his younger years.\nWhen Frimpong was new to City, Bernice used to perk him up with takeaway meals of chicken and chips to make the three-bus ride home from training more enjoyable. Those doubts bubbled up again after he joined Celtic, and he questioned whether leaving his home in Manchester was the right move. Then, when he was settled in Scotland, he once again jumped out of his comfort zone to move to a new country and push himself further.\nLike on so many other occasions that had spoken to his bravery and willingness to take risks and after working through different systems, understanding that a rise to the top is a staggered process, here he was enjoying the fruits of that labour.\nThere is still a sense the best is yet to come both for club and country. Frimpong was part of the Netherlands\u2019 2022 World Cup squad in Qatar but did not feature in the tournament. He was used sparingly in the Euros last summer but starred in the unfortunate penalty shootout defeat by Spain in the Nations League quarter-final in March where he played every minute of both legs in a sign of his growing importance to the team.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI learned very early not to put a sticker on a player when they are young because an important quality is to be a good character and have a hard-working mentality,\u201d says Stekelenburg, who became assistant manager of the Netherlands between 2019-2021.\n\u201cJeremie has both and now he has a really big advantage in that he will play for a coach at his club who really suits his style. Arne (Slot) will know that he has a right-winger (Mohamed Salah) in front of him who likes to cut in, so that will suit Jeremie when he goes on the outside. It\u2019s going to be a real benefit for him.\u201d\nFrimpong is passionate and consistent in his message that he\u2019s a right-back who can defend and attack. He works with personal coaches off the pitch to get tailored feedback across areas such as positioning, defending and tactical analysis. He also leans on the assistance of an attacking coach to maximise his output and will soon be working alongside one of the brightest thinkers in Slot as Liverpool look to build on this season\u2019s title win.\nHe will bring a spark off the field, too, given his enthusiasm for music, fashion, anime and charitable causes that should appeal to Liverpool fans and commercial partners.\nFilling the boots of Trent Alexander-Arnold will not be easy, but there is a belief from those who know him best that Anfield\u2019s stage is where he will shine.\n(Top image: Ina Fassbender/AFP via Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)"

      "text": "As several Liverpool senior players found their touch and technique deserting them on the cut-up surface of the Nissan Stadium, Rio Ngumoha showed them how it\u2019s done.\nNot for the first time during this pre-season, the 16-year-old was the player everybody was talking about following another brilliant cameo that included the goal that sealed Liverpool\u2019s 3-1 victory over Yokohama F Marinos.\nAdvertisement\nIn just 26 minutes, the youngster lit up the game in Tokyo, bamboozling the hosts\u2019 tiring defence, just as he had in previous games against Preston North End, Stoke City and Milan.\nIt is a testament to how he is viewed and the impact he has made this summer that Liverpool do not see left wing as an area of their squad that needs strengthening, even after the sale of Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich.\nCody Gakpo is the established left-winger, while Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike could also play there. But Ngumoha\u2019s development has seen him force his way into Slot\u2019s thinking for a permanent place in his first-team squad and potentially save the club some money in the transfer market. There is no desire to block Ngumoha\u2019s pathway to senior football.\nSo, how has he done it?\nWhen Ngumoha chose to leave Chelsea for Liverpool last year, the London club were furious that they were losing one of England\u2019s brightest young talents. Since his arrival, he has shown why there was such disappointment in west London, impressing Liverpool\u2019s senior and academy coaching staff in training sessions and matches for various age groups.\nHis surprise start against Accrington Stanley in the third round of the FA Cup in January exposed him to Liverpool supporters at first-team level and rewarded him for the rapid progress he was making.\nHis 72-minute showing at Anfield that day was full of quick feet and excitement. The League Two side quickly doubled up on him and the only missing piece to his performance was end product \u2014 quite normal for a 16-year-old making their debut.\nStill, as he returned to the under-21 setup for the rest of the campaign, improving his end product became a point of emphasis. If any indication was needed on how that is going, he has two goals and one assist in his four appearances so far in pre-season.\nAdvertisement\nHis goal at Yokohama illustrated how dangerous he can be with the ball at his feet and space to run into.\nWith Liverpool on the counter-attack, Ngumoha advanced from near the halfway line and showed his confidence to keep hold of the ball rather than use any of his team-mates, skip past the challenge of Kosei Suwama, and fire a shot beyond Ryoya Kimura.\nThe smile on Mohamed Salah\u2019s face in the moments after the goal further emphasised the impact he has made. Salah and other senior squad members, including Andy Robertson, have helped Ngumoha settle in at first-team level, offering advice when possible.\nThere is a fearlessness to everything he does, but he couples that with quality. This isn\u2019t a youngster dribbling down blind alleys to try to impress; this is a winger tormenting defenders with trickery, pace and purpose.\nFrom the moment he was named in the starting XI against Preston, Ngumoha has had one aim: to get on the ball and drive at his opponent. He was a constant threat at Deepdale and the source of several key chances, including Conor Bradley\u2019s opening goal.\nHe is not quite a chalk-on-boots winger, but Ngumoha stays high and wide to give him space to be found by team-mates. That allows him to build up speed and attack the defender, putting them on the back foot.\nAs the example below shows, when he is around the opposition penalty box, he uses his close control, agility and acceleration to burst away from opponents. On this occasion, he shaped to come inside before darting to the byline. His cross was intercepted with Darwin Nunez ready to pounce.\nA similar move nearly led to a goal against Milan, when he used that speed to wrong-foot Fikayo Tomori and unleash an effort on goal that was parried away by Mike Maignan.\nThe connection he has built with Trey Nyoni has been on display, too, and the pair complement each other on the pitch.\nWhen playing together, the pair frequently combine with one-twos around the opposition area, with Ngumoha capable of making dangerous runs into the box, and Nyoni has the quality to pick out the return pass.\nHe nearly got on the scoresheet earlier against Yokohama by linking with Nyoni. Again, Ngumoha used his agility to work a shooting opportunity, breaking into a similar position to where he scored his goal against Stoke, but his effort was saved.\nThat moment, however, was also a reminder that Ngumoha is a young man with plenty to learn, especially in regards to his decision-making. While he did manage to shoot, he could have laid the ball off to Alexis Mac Allister or Curtis Jones to create a better goalscoring opportunity.\nThat was not lost on Slot when he addressed the media after the game. \u201cThere was also a moment in the game where he should have squared it to Macca (Mac Allister) or Curtis (Jones),\u201d he said. \u201cSo, (there were) also learning parts for him. But if you are 16 and you can impact the game like he did, that\u2019s definitely worth a compliment.\n\u201cRio again showed the quality he has and that\u2019s nice for us because we have a lot of very good players. But to get some very good players through the academy is always helpful and always gives energy to a team as well.\u201d\nNgumoha\u2019s most encouraging performance of the four so far was against Milan when he came up against Tomori, who is an experienced top-level defender that has strength and speed.\nThe 27-year-old got the better of the early exchanges, but as the half wore on, Ngumoha\u2019s relentlessness allowed him to start getting the better of the defender, including for his assist for Dominik Szoboszlai.\nHis quick feet forced Tomori to backpedal and created space for him to cross the ball. While the low delivery was blocked, Ngumoha didn\u2019t rush his next move, playing the sensible pass to Szoboszlai, who produced an excellent finish.\nGiven this was a summer without a major international tournament, Slot has been able to work with the bulk of his first-team squad from the moment pre-season began. That meant fewer youngsters made up the tour squad than usual, so it was a statement to the impression Ngumoha and fellow youngster Nyoni had made that they were taken on the trip.\nAdvertisement\nDuring the opening weeks and on tour, the pair have continued to impress the first-team coaching staff with their attitude and talent, and they have grasped their opportunity in matches. There is a sense that they could become permanent fixtures in the squad, which would allow other youngsters such as Tyler Morton and Ben Doak to move on without any concerns over the squad\u2019s depth in those areas.\nNgumoha\u2019s potentially larger role this season is more than anyone could reasonably have expected even a month ago. He will still need to be managed carefully and expectations should remain realistic.\nBut the problem is that Ngumoha is showing why he is one of the hottest prospects in European football. He may be impossible to ignore.\n(Top photo: Kenta Harada/Getty Images)"
