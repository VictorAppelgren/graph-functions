  "title": "Russia clinches major new gas pipeline deal with China as West shuns supplies",
  "description": "Russia and China on Tuesday signed a major deal to build the long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline.",
  "content": "Russia and China on Tuesday signed a legally binding deal to build the long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, deepening commercial ties in what is likely to be seen as a defiant signal to the West. Alexei Miller, the chief executive of Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom, told Russian news agencies that a memorandum of understanding had been signed on the construction of the new gas pipeline, following talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping in Beijing. The pipeline, which is set to transit gas reserves in Russia's West Siberia to northern China via eastern Mongolia, will make it possible to supply 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year, Miller said, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Supplies under the new Power of Siberia 2 agreement will run for 30 years. The price of the gas via the new pipeline will be agreed on separately, Miller said. The two countries also signed a separate agreement for Gazprom to boost gas supplies to China through the existing Power of Siberia pipeline. A Gazprom spokesperson was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC. Beijing has not yet confirmed Miller's announcement, although state news agency Xinhua reported that the two countries signed more than 20 cooperation agreements, with energy deals among them.\n\nRussia's gas exports to Europe have collapsed since Moscow's full-scale of invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The West has imposed punitive economic sanctions on the Kremlin and reduced dependency on Russian energy, seeking to cut off a major source of revenues funding Putin's war machine. The European Union, for example, introduced measures to stop the import of Russian gas and oil by the end of 2027, while the U.S. imposed a ban on the import of Russian fossil fuels in March 2022. The measures have injected fresh urgency into Moscow's years-long push to build the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline. As a result, Russia has been trying to pivot to Beijing to replace Europe as its major gas customer.\n\nChristopher Granville, managing director at TS Lombard, said that while the significance of the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline agreement is \"somewhat limited,\" it should not be dismissed as a \"nothing burger\" either. \"For the past decade, Gazprom has been pushing China to give the go-ahead for Power of Siberia-2, only to be met - until now - with positive but non-committal noises. So today's signing of a MOU is a step forward for Gazprom,\" Granville told CNBC by email. \"The fact that this has happened against the background of the fraught Ukraine war endgame, is a clear enough signal of China's steady strategic backing for Russia as the lynchpin of the new multipolar order to which both these core Eurasian powers aspire,\" Granville said.\n\nIt is a long way, however, from an MOU to a Final Investment Decision. The equivalent MOU-style agreement in principle on the original Power of Siberia pipeline was struck in the mid-2000s, Granville said, noting that a definitive pricing agreement was not agreed until 2014. Russia and China have sought to showcase a new global security and economic order at the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. In a thinly veiled swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, China's Xi said in his opening speech on Monday that the world had entered \"a new phase of turbulence\" with global governance at a \"new crossroads.\"\n\nTimothy Ash, an associate fellow in the Russian and Eurasia program at Chatham House, said China has been \"playing very hard\" to get the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline deal over the line. That's partly because of Russia's urgency to sign an agreement given the loss of more than 120 bcm in gas exports to Europe, Ash said, and perhaps because Beijing had previously been \"mindful of not annoying\" the Biden administration by going all out in support of Putin.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday pushed back against an emerging critique of his on-again, off-again tariff threats, which has been derisively summed up as the \"TACO trade.\"\nThe term coined by a Financial Times columnist \u2014 which stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out\" \u2014 describes a pattern in which Trump announces heavy new tariffs, sending markets tumbling, and then later pauses or lightens them, causing markets to rebound.\nWhen asked by CNBC about the term at the White House, Trump denied that he had ever backed down and suggested that his moves have helped the U.S. gain ground in trade negotiations.\n\"After I did what I did, they said, 'We'll meet anytime you want,'\" Trump said of the European Union, which he had recently targeted with a 50% U.S. tariff \u2014 before announcing two days later that he was delaying that new levy.\n\"You call that chickening out?\" Trump said.\n\"It's called negotiation,\" he added, after criticizing the question as \"nasty.\"\nStocks fell Friday after Trump called for the U.S. to impose the steep tariff on the EU starting June 1. On Sunday, Trump said he would delay that deadline to July 9 after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked for an extension.\nIn the next trading session on Tuesday, stocks rallied across major indexes.\nTrump in Wednesday's remarks went on to credit the 50% tariff threat with jumpstarting trade talks between the U.S. and the EU.\n\"The sad thing is, now, when I make a deal with them, it's something much more reasonable, they'll say, 'Oh, he was chicken, he was chicken,'\" Trump said. \"That's so unbelievable.\"\nThe EU-tariff turnabout is not Trump's first time abruptly reversing his own trade policies.\nAfter weeks of buildup, Trump on April 2 unveiled individualized \"reciprocal\" tariff rates against almost every country on Earth, with some getting hit with massive duties of 30% or more.\nOne week later \u2014 and following several bouts of stock-market turmoil \u2014 Trump said he would drop all of those tariffs down to 10% for 90 days. Markets responded with one of the biggest single-day rallies in history.\nThe Trump administration's trade war with China has followed a similar path. The president in April ratcheted up blanket tariffs on Beijing as high as 145%, spurring retaliation and spooking investors. He dropped them to 30% a month later, following an initial round of trade talks.\n\u2014 CNBC's Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report."

      "text": "The annual Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit has wound down in Tianjin with signals of a closer relationship among its members at a time when the world has been roiled by U.S. trade policies and tariffs.\nThe two-day event, attended by more than 20 leaders of non-Western countries, was seen as showcasing Beijing's ambition for a new global security and economic order that poses a challenge to the U.S.\nIn a thinly-veiled swipe at the U.S. President Donald Trump's global tariff campaign, Chinese President Xi Jinping told his counterparts in his opening speech Monday that the \"shadows of Cold War mentality and bullying have not dissipated, with new challenges mounting.\"\nThe world has entered \"a new phase of turbulence\" with global governance at a \"new crossroads,\" Xi said, calling for joint efforts to build a \"more just and balanced international governance framework.\"\nTo what extent will Beijing's push to reshape the global order will materialize remains to be seen. Meanwhile, here are the key takeaways from the SCO summit:\nThawing India-China relations\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first meeting on Chinese soil in seven years, sharing a vision of being partners not rivals.\nThe leaders of the world's two most populous nations \u2014 representing some 2.8 billion people \u2014 pledged to step up cooperation and work toward resolving their long-running border dispute.\nThe rapprochement comes as both countries face pressure from steep U.S. tariffs. \"Modi and Xi used all the diplomatic words available to signal a new found commitment ... partially motivated by high Trump tariffs on both,\" said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute.\nStill, India remains wary of a flood of cheap Chinese imports threatening its domestic industries and border disputes are far from resolved. China's relationship with Pakistan also remains a sticking point in the New Delhi-Beijing relationship.\n\"Improving trade ties won't be easy,\" Cutler said, noting New Delhi was likely to keep restrictive measures in place after a series of antidumping cases against Chinese imports.\nXi, Putin, Modi troika\nThe summit also captured Xi, Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin holding hands and sharing a good laugh on the sidelines of the SCO, at a time when the U.S. has charged India and China of fueling Moscow's war against Ukraine.\nIndia \u2014 long courted by the U.S. as a counterweight to China \u2014 has been the target of Trump's steep tariffs, the Kremlin has brushed aside Washington's push for peace in Ukraine, and Beijing continues to spar with the U.S. over trade, technology and geopolitical issues.\nThe symbolism of the three leaders together projects China as an alternative to the U.S. as a partner. Trump is \"breathing new life\" into the summit, giving China a chance to frame its diplomacy as more dependable than Washington's, said Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst at Eurasia Group.\nModi told his Russian counterpart that India and Russia stood side by side even in difficult times after Putin called Modi his \"dear friend,\" describing their relations as \"friendly and trusting.\" Later Monday, Modi posted on X a photo of himself with Putin inside the Russian leader's armored Aurus limousine.\n\"India is using this to opportunistically send a signal indirectly to Washington, that it has strategic options, not only in Beijing, but also in Moscow,\" Chan said.\nFor Russia, the SCO also remains one of the few international platforms where Putin is not on the defensive, underscoring Moscow's enduring ties with influential Asian partners despite Western sanctions.\nAI partnership roadmap\nThe Tianjin Declaration of the SCO Council reaffirmed commitments to strengthen artificial intelligence cooperation, underscoring \"equal rights of all countries to develop and use AI.\"\nThat followed Premier Li Qiang's remarks at another AI conference in Shanghai last month, where he proposed creating an organization to coordinate global efforts to regulate the fast-evolving AI technology.\nThe SCO members, in a joint declaration, pledged to cooperate on reducing risks and improving the security and accountability of AI for the benefits of humanity, while committing to implement a roadmap for joint AI cooperation and development.\nIn a statement following the SCO AI Cooperation Forum held in May, Beijing called on member states to work together in building a collaboration center for AI application, while pledging to promote open-source AI models and share advanced technologies.\n\"Beijing has leaned into 'open-source [large-language-models]' as productivity infrastructure,\" said Paul Triolo, a partner at DGA Group, adding that the challenge lies in \"how or if to regulate the use of open source models across borders.\"\nA new development bank\nSome member states agreed to set up an SCO development bank, what would be a significant step in the bloc's long-standing goal of establishing an alternative payment system that reduces reliance on the U.S. dollar.\nChina is the largest shareholder of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, that was launched in 2014 to fund projects in developing nations as a direct challenge to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.\nWhile the proposed development bank may fall short of the AIIB's scale, it reflects Xi's ambition to position himself as the 'architect' of a China-led global governance framework, said Steven Okun, chief executive officer of consultancy APAC Advisors.\nBeijing also pledged 2 billion yuan ($280 million) in free aid for member states this year and another 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in loans to the organization's members over the next three years."

      "text": "Russia launched an unprecedented invasion of its neighbor Ukraine on Thursday, with military assaults on several key Ukrainian cities including its capital, Kyiv.\nThe attack on Ukraine is taking place both on the ground and by air, with reports that Russian forces have breached the Kyiv region. Explosions have also been heard in the cities of Odessa, Kharkiv and Mariupol, and there are reports of fighting and fatalities in other parts of the country.\nOfficials said the offensive had already killed dozens of soldiers and several civilians as of Thursday afternoon.\nFollow our live updates here: Explosions and sirens in Kyiv as Russia invades Ukraine\nStocks fell sharply on the news of the invasion with investors fleeing for safe-haven assets, while global energy prices jumped to multi-year highs.\nRussia began attacking various positions across the country early Thursday local time after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would carry out a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\nIts goal, Putin said, was what he called \"the demilitarization\" of Ukraine. He said Russia's plans do not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories, saying \"we are not going to impose anything on anyone by force.\"\nThere's little evidence of military aggression from Ukraine, and Russia's claims to the contrary are seen by many as a pretext for justifying an invasion.\nOn Thursday on Twitter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for \"an immediate end to Putin's war against the world\" and said \"we are building an anti-Putin coalition\" without elaborating further. He also called for immediate sanctions on Russia as well as \"defense and financial support\" saying \"the world must force Russia into peace.\"\nThe Kremlin issued more statements later Thursday, saying Putin would decide how long the military operation would last \"based on its progress and aims.\" Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also told reporters Ukraine needs to \"ideally\" be \"liberated\" but that \"nobody is talking about the occupation of Ukraine,\" saying that word was \"unacceptable,\" according to Reuters.\nSpeaking Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that \"in the coming days and weeks, there will come even more [soldiers], so we will further increase and we are increasing our presence in the eastern part of the alliance,\" although he also repeated that, as it stands, NATO had no plans to send its troops into Ukraine.\nThe comments came as Ukraine's military said Russia had attacked it with more than 30 strikes on civilian and military infrastructure, including the use of Kalibr cruise missiles.\nClose followers of Russian politics believe Putin wants to destabilize Ukraine's pro-Western government and to instead install a pro-Russia regime there.\nU.S., Europe and Ukrainian officials have condemned the attack with Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, calling for \"heavy sanctions\" on Moscow.\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday morning convened a meeting of the National Security Council \u2014 the third this week \u2014 to discuss the U.S. response to the attacks. He will also meet virtually with G-7 members on Thursday ahead of an address to the nation.\nIt's unclear, as yet, whether Western powers will deploy military means to stop Putin. Several countries, including the U.S. and U.K., have already sent weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself. Ukraine's foreign minister has called for more weapons and financial and humanitarian assistance.\nPutin issued a chilling warning to the West when he announced the military operation against Ukraine, saying any country that tried to \"interfere\" would face immediate consequences.\nWhat's going on?\nThe situation in Ukraine is rapidly deteriorating and developments are difficult to confirm, but there are already reports of casualties.\nOleksiy Arestovych, an advisor to Ukraine's Presidential Office, told NBC News that the government had received confirmation that \"a couple of dozen\" Ukrainian soldiers had died, mostly from the airstrikes and rocket strikes in the morning.\nUkraine's armed forces have also claimed they have destroyed some Russian aircraft and that a number of Russian soldiers have died during fighting Thursday.\nOperational information released by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook stated that four Russian tanks were \"burned\" in the Kharkiv area, in northeast Ukraine near the Russian border, but also that \"heavy battles\" were taking place in the area.\nUkraine's Joint Forces Command reported that about 50 Russian \"occupiers\" were killed in the Shchastya area in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, earlier on Facebook. Ukrainian forces had \"stopped the opponent\" in Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine, according to a later Facebook post.\nUkraine's State Emergency Service has also reported a fire at a residential building in Chuguiv in the Kharkiv region, that it said was due to shelling. A minor had died during the incident and other people were injured, the service said.\nEarlier, Ukrainian police said that six people had been killed during bombing of Podilsk in the Odessa region, with a further seven people wounded and 19 people missing, which was confirmed by NBC News.\nA video has also been released by the Ukrainian Interior Ministry which appeared to show military vehicles crossing the border into Ukraine. The ministry said the video was filmed early Thursday morning at the border with Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\nSome of the vehicles were seen to have a \"Z\" mark, which has been a feature of Russian military vehicles that had been massing along the border with Ukraine in recent months although it cannot be definitively said that the vehicles are Russian.\nNBC News has also been able to verify a video showing explosions over the skyline of Kharkiv.\nThere are reports of the center of Kyiv being largely deserted on Thursday and of large traffic jams forming on roads out of the city as people try to leave for safety. Western officials have warned there could be a wave of migration into Eastern Europe as Ukrainians flee the conflict.\nUkraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, posted a message on Facebook in which he called upon able Ukrainians to take up arms against Russian forces.\n\"Anyone who is ready and able to hold weapons\" can now join the Territorial Defense Forces, he said, adding that to get weapons, Ukrainians needed to contact \"brigades and battalions directly in your region. You only need to have a passport,\" to sign up, he said.\n\"The enemy attacks, but our army is unbreakable,\" Reznikov wrote, noting that Ukraine had gone \"into total defense mode.\"\n\u2014CNBC's Karen Gilchrist contributed to this report."

While the MOU is a step forward for Gazprom, it remains an early stage before a final investment decision and pricing are set.",
