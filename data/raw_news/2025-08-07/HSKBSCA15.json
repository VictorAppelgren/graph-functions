  "content": "FDA-cleared PreClara\u2122 Ratio (sFlt-1/PlGF) biomarker test offers clinicians a crucial tool for managing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, with potential significant cost savings and improved patient outcomes\n\nDUBLIN, Aug. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trinity Biotech plc TRIB, a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on human diagnostics and diabetes management solutions, including wearable biosensors, today announced the launch of a new testing service for preeclampsia, a significant advancement in maternal health diagnostics. The service is planned to be rolled out in Q3 2025 through Trinity Biotech's New York-based reference laboratory.\n\nTrinity Biotech will offer the FDA-cleared PreClara Ratio (sFlt-1/PlGF) biomarker test as part of a strategic collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific, enhancing Trinity Biotech's capabilities to deliver critical maternal health diagnostics. Approximately 500,000 women in the United States every year are impacted by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy - a leading cause of maternal and neonatal complications. The sFlt-1/PlGF test provides time-sensitive, clinically actionable insights that support healthcare providers in making earlier, more informed decisions for hospitalized patients. By helping to assess the likelihood of progression to severe preeclampsia, the test enables more targeted and timely management of care for this high-risk patient population.\n\n\"This launch represents an important strategic milestone in Trinity Biotech's maternal health strategy, significantly enhancing our position in this critical clinical area, and is a further step in our transformation to focus on new technology platforms in large impact areas,\" said John Gillard, CEO of Trinity Biotech. \"Our expanding maternal health portfolio reflects our continued commitment to delivering value for our shareholders through innovations that address urgent healthcare needs, and as a company we are very proud to be part of supporting patients in this important healthcare area.\"\n\nThe clinical and economic value of the sFlt-1/PlGF test is reinforced by recent U.S.-based studies. Research published in March 2025 demonstrated potential neonatal cost savings exceeding $10 million per 1,000 patients1 when the test is incorporated into standard care. These savings primarily stem from reduced preterm deliveries and neonatal intensive care unit admissions, highlighting both clinical efficacy and economic benefit.\n\nThe launch of the sFlt-1/PlGF testing service lays critical groundwork for the anticipated commercial introduction of PrePsia\u2122, Trinity Biotech's proprietary preeclampsia risk assessment technology designed for use in early pregnancy.\n\nAbout Preeclampsia\n\nPreeclampsia is a rapidly progressive hypertensive disorder affecting approximately 5-8% of pregnancies2, characterized by sudden onset high blood pressure and an associated sign of organ dysfunction like protein in the urine or severe headache. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial, as preeclampsia significantly contributes to maternal morbidity, mortality, and premature births. In the United States, the condition already accounts for approximately 11%3 of maternal deaths and 15%4 of premature births, with cases nearly doubling since 20075.\n\nPreClara Ratio (sFlt-1/PlGF) Intended Use\n\nThe PreClara Ratio (sFlt-1/PlGF) is to be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical assessments to aid in the risk assessment of pregnant women (singleton pregnancies between 23+0 and 34+6/7 weeks gestation) hospitalized for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (preeclampsia, chronic hypertension with or without superimposed preeclampsia, or gestational hypertension) for progression to preeclampsia with severe features (as defined by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) within two weeks of presentation. The PreClara Ratio must be calculated using the B\u00b7R\u00b7A\u00b7H\u00b7M\u00b7S sFlt-1 KRYPTOR and the B\u00b7R\u00b7A\u00b7H\u00b7M\u00b7S PlGF plus KRYPTOR results measured on the B\u00b7R\u00b7A\u00b7H\u00b7M\u00b7S KRYPTOR analyzer.\n\nThis release includes statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"Reform Act\"), including but not limited to statements related to Trinity Biotech's cash position, financial resources and potential for future growth, market acceptance and penetration of new or planned product offerings, and future recurring revenues and results of operations.

People with preeclampsia experience high blood pressure, protein in their pee, swelling, headaches and blurred vision. But you may have no symptoms. Treatment is necessary to avoid life-threatening complications. It typically goes away after childbirth.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Policy\nPreeclampsia is a serious blood pressure condition that develops during pregnancy. People with preeclampsia often have high blood pressure (hypertension) and high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria). Preeclampsia usually develops after the 20th week of pregnancy.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nPreeclampsia can also affect other organs in your body and cause kidney and liver damage, brain injury and other serious side effects. It\u2019s dangerous for both you and the developing fetus. Because of these risks, your healthcare provider will need to monitor your pregnancy closely and recommend treatment right away.\nPreeclampsia is a condition unique to pregnancy that complicates between 5% and 8% of all births in the United States. It\u2019s also the cause of about 15% of premature deliveries (delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy) in the U.S.\nYes, it can be. When you have preeclampsia, your blood pressure is (higher than 140/90 mmHg), and you may have high levels of protein in your pee (a sign of kidney damage). Preeclampsia puts stress on your heart and other organs and can cause serious complications. It can also affect the blood supply to the placenta, damage your liver and kidneys or cause fluid to build up in your lungs. Getting treatment is critical to avoid life-threatening complications.\nMany people with preeclampsia don\u2019t have signs or symptoms until a visit with their healthcare provider. For those that do, some of the first signs of preeclampsia are high blood pressure, protein in your pee and retaining water (this can cause weight gain and swelling).\nAdvertisement\nOther signs of preeclampsia include:\nYou often don\u2019t know you have preeclampsia until your healthcare provider checks your blood pressure and urine (pee) at a prenatal appointment. It\u2019s also important to share all of your pregnancy symptoms with your healthcare provider.\nSevere preeclampsia may also include signs like:\nIf your preeclampsia is severe, your healthcare provider may admit you to the hospital for closer observation. In some instances, you\u2019ll need to deliver your baby right away.\nNo one is entirely sure. Some researchers believe preeclampsia may happen due to a problem with blood supply to the placenta.\nWhile stress may impact blood pressure, stress isn\u2019t a direct cause of preeclampsia. While some stress is unavoidable during pregnancy, avoiding high-stress situations or learning to manage your stress is a good idea.\nHealthcare providers aren\u2019t entirely sure why some people develop preeclampsia, but they know some factors can increase your risk of developing it. They classify your risk as high or moderate.\nFactors that may put you at high risk for preeclampsia are:\nFactors that put you at moderate risk of preeclampsia are:\nPreeclampsia typically occurs after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Most preeclampsia occurs in the third trimester (after 27 weeks). When it develops before 34 weeks of pregnancy, it\u2019s called early-onset preeclampsia.\nPreeclampsia can also come after delivery (postpartum preeclampsia), which usually occurs between the first few days to one week after delivery.\nIf left untreated, preeclampsia can be potentially fatal to both you and the fetus. It can cause severe kidney and liver damage and interfere with your brain function. If you're pregnant, some of the most serious preeclampsia complications are:\nAdvertisement\nPreeclampsia can cause HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count). This happens when preeclampsia damages your liver and red blood cells and interferes with blood clotting.\nThe most common complications to the fetus are:\nPeople with preeclampsia \u2014 particularly those who develop the condition early in pregnancy \u2014 are at a greater risk for the following conditions later in life:\nYou can work with your primary care provider to take steps to reduce these risks.\nHealthcare providers often diagnose preeclampsia during a routine prenatal appointment. Routine prenatal appointments occur at regular intervals during pregnancy. It\u2019s where your healthcare provider checks things like your pregnancy weight gain and blood pressure.\nIf your provider suspects preeclampsia, they may:\nAdvertisement\nPreeclampsia can be mild or severe. Mild preeclampsia is when you have high blood pressure plus high levels of protein in your pee.\nSevere preeclampsia is when you have signs of mild preeclampsia plus:\nYour healthcare provider will advise you on the best way to treat preeclampsia. Treatment generally depends on how severe your preeclampsia is and how far along you are in pregnancy. Your healthcare provider will want you to remain pregnant as long as possible \u2014 as long as preeclampsia isn\u2019t putting your life in danger.\nIf you\u2019re close to full term (37 weeks pregnant), your provider will probably recommend an early delivery. You can still have a vaginal delivery, but sometimes, a C-section is safer. Your healthcare provider may give you medication to help the fetus\u2019s lungs develop and manage your blood pressure until they can deliver your baby. Sometimes, it\u2019s safer to deliver the baby early than to risk prolonging the pregnancy.\nWhen preeclampsia develops earlier in pregnancy, your provider will monitor you closely for the rest of your pregnancy. They\u2019ll want to prolong pregnancy as long as possible to allow for the fetus to grow and develop. You\u2019ll have more frequent prenatal appointments, including ultrasounds, urine tests and blood draws. You may have to check your blood pressure at home. If the preeclampsia worsens or becomes more severe, your provider will recommend delivery.\nAdvertisement\nIf you have severe preeclampsia at diagnosis, you could remain in the hospital for monitoring until you deliver your baby.\nDuring labor and delivery, your provider may give you magnesium sulfate to prevent eclampsia (seizures from preeclampsia).\nNo. The only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. Your healthcare provider will still want to monitor you for several weeks after delivery to make sure your symptoms go away.\nYes, you can still have a vaginal delivery if you have preeclampsia.\nYes. Preeclampsia can cause preterm delivery (your baby being born early). Premature babies are at an increased risk for health complications like low birth weight and breathing issues.\nPreeclampsia typically goes away within days to weeks following delivery. Sometimes, your blood pressure can remain high for a few weeks after delivery, requiring treatment with medication. Your healthcare provider will work with you after your pregnancy to manage your blood pressure.\nIf you have a risk factor for preeclampsia, there are some steps you can take before and during pregnancy to lower the chance of developing preeclampsia. These steps can include:\nTaking a baby aspirin daily may decrease your risk of developing preeclampsia by about 15%. If you have risk factors for preeclampsia, your healthcare provider may recommend starting aspirin in early pregnancy (around 12 weeks in pregnancy). Don\u2019t start taking aspirin unless your provider tells you.\nPreeclampsia can be a fatal condition during pregnancy. If you\u2019re getting treatment for this condition, make sure to see your healthcare provider for all of your appointments and blood or urine tests. Contact your obstetrician if you have any concerns or questions about your symptoms.\nGo to the nearest hospital if you\u2019re pregnant and experience the following:\nIf your healthcare provider gives you a preeclampsia diagnosis, it\u2019s normal to have concerns. Some common questions to ask your healthcare provider are:\nIn most cases, your provider will recognize signs of preeclampsia during a prenatal appointment.\nThe early signs of preeclampsia usually include:\nEclampsia is severe preeclampsia that causes seizures. It\u2019s considered a complication of preeclampsia, but it can happen without signs of preeclampsia.\nPostpartum preeclampsia is when you develop preeclampsia after your baby is born. It typically happens within two days of giving birth but can also develop several weeks later.\nPreeclampsia is a serious condition that most people aren\u2019t aware they have. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to go to all your prenatal appointments and be open with your provider about symptoms you feel during pregnancy.\nAfter diagnosis, your healthcare provider will watch your pregnancy closely. In severe cases, they may recommend delivery as soon as possible. Their goal is to keep both you and the fetus safe and healthy. Most people with preeclampsia go on to have healthy babies. Preeclampsia almost always goes away within a few weeks after your baby is born.\nYour Ob/Gyn is there for you throughout many different parts of your life. At Cleveland Clinic, our experts can help you throughout your entire journey.\nLast reviewed on 05/28/2024.\nLearn more about the Health Library and our editorial process."

      "text": "The recent change in the maternal mortality narrative in the United States likely surprised many obstetricians, epidemiologists, and public health experts. For more than a decade, several articles and publications from reputable organizations documented temporal increases in maternal mortality rates, and maternal mortality rates in the United States that were higher than those in many other countries.1\u20135 More recently, detailed reports published by the National Center for Health Statistics have contradicted these assessments.6\u20138 The latter reports showed that there had been no temporal increase in overall maternal death rates in the United States; the rising trend in maternal mortality rates was entirely an artifact of changes in maternal death surveillance.\nThis Commentary provides the background to the National Center for Health Statistics reports, summarizes their findings, describes temporal trends and the current status of maternal mortality in the United States, identifies surveillance and clinical concerns, and discusses issues related to the prevention of maternal death. These topics merit consideration especially because the current literature9\u201312 fails to recognize the full import of the National Center for Health Statistics reports.\nBACKGROUND TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS REPORTS\nStudies carried out before 2003 showed that identification of maternal deaths based solely on death certificate information resulted in substantial numbers of missed maternal deaths.13\u201316 These studies led the National Center for Health Statistics to introduce a standard pregnancy checkbox on the revised 2003 death certificate. Individual states began using this pregnancy checkbox at different times,6 and the National Center for Health Statistics discontinued its official publication of the national maternal mortality rate from 2007 to 2019.8 The staggered implementation of the pregnancy checkbox by the states resulted in a progressive increase in the number of reported maternal deaths (Fig. 1A17). The identification of late maternal deaths (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] code O96, O97) increased substantially as did maternal deaths from some less clearly defined causes of death, such as \u201cOther specified pregnancy-related conditions\u201d (ICD-10 O268; Fig. 1B).\nThe discontinuation of authoritative National Center for Health Statistics reports on maternal mortality rates in the United States in 2007 resulted in many publications on maternal mortality that did not adequately address the surveillance implications of the newly introduced pregnancy checkbox. Journalists and researchers implicated diverse factors as the cause for the temporal increase in maternal mortality rates, including rising cesarean delivery rates,18,19 excessive use of ultrasonography,19 systemic racism,20 reduced access to abortion services, and lack of funding for Planned Parenthood.21\nSUMMARY OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS REPORTS\nThe National Center for Health Statistics reports6\u20138 were based on detailed studies of original death certificates and included recoding and reclassification of the underlying cause of death both with and without information from the pregnancy checkbox. These investigations showed that there was no temporal increase in maternal mortality rates. When pregnancy checkbox information was not used, maternal mortality rates were 8.9 per 100,000 live births in 2002, 8.7 in 2015, 8.7 in 2016, 11.5 in 2017, and 8.7 in 2018.8\nThe pregnancy checkbox led to an increase in maternal mortality rates by about 9.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births between 2003 and 2017.7 However, the effect of the checkbox differed by maternal age, race and Hispanic origin, and underlying cause of death.7 The contribution of the pregnancy checkbox was negligible for several cause-of-death categories, though death rates within some such categories increased or decreased due to unrelated factors.7 On the other hand, the pregnancy checkbox profoundly increased the identification of some less informative causes of death (eg, \u201cOther specified pregnancy-related conditions\u201d [ICD-10 O268] and \u201cOther obstetric conditions not elsewhere classified\u201d [ICD-10 O99]) and late maternal deaths.\nAlthough the pregnancy checkbox improved the detection of some maternal deaths, it also incorrectly identified some deaths to nonpregnant women as maternal deaths or late maternal deaths. The most egregious checkbox errors occurred among older women; for example, in 2013, 187 women aged 85 years or older were identified by the checkbox as pregnant at the time of death or within 1 year of death.8 For 2018 data, the National Center for Health Statistics addressed such false positive maternal deaths by restricting use of pregnancy checkbox information for determining the underlying cause of death to women aged 10\u201344 years.8\nTEMPORAL TRENDS IN MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES\nThe National Center for Health Statistics investigation showed that maternal mortality rates did not increase significantly between 2002 and 2015\u20132016 and 2018 when all rates were estimated without using information from the pregnancy checkbox.6\u20138 In fact, between 2000 and 2018, maternal mortality rates (calculated without checkbox information) showed a significant 21% decline after adjustment for maternal age (standardized mortality ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.72\u20130.87; Appendix 1, available online at https://links.lww.com/AOG/C281).\nThe finding by the National Center for Health Statistics that some cause-of-death categories were not affected by the pregnancy checkbox7 permits a cautious assessment of the temporal trends in the unaffected categories (note: some such unaffected categories showed changes due to unrelated factors). This assessment reveals significant declines in maternal deaths from abortive outcomes and labor and delivery complications; significant increases in maternal deaths from other maternal disorders, mental and central nervous system disorders, and respiratory diseases; and stable patterns in maternal deaths from hypertensive disorders, conditions related to the fetus, amniotic cavity, and complications related to the puerperium (Appendix 2, available online at https://links.lww.com/AOG/C281).\nTemporal trends in the above-mentioned underlying cause-of-death categories conceal some unexpected changes in cause-of-death subcategories. Figure 2A shows increases in deaths from chronic hypertension, declines in preeclampsia\u2013eclampsia deaths, and low, stable rates of deaths from gestational hypertension. Figure 2B shows a rise and fall in maternal deaths due to diabetes mellitus, an increase in maternal deaths due to liver disorders, and a small absolute increase in deaths from adherent placenta. Figure 2C shows declines in maternal deaths from amniotic fluid embolism, a small increase in maternal deaths from blood-clot embolism, and larger increases in maternal deaths from mental and central nervous system disorders. Discrepant patterns in related subcategories of maternal death (eg, preeclampsia\u2013eclampsia vs chronic hypertension; amniotic fluid embolism vs blood clot embolism) may be indicative of misclassification problems (see below).\nOther noteworthy temporal changes in cause of death subcategories included significant declines in maternal deaths from medical abortion and unspecified abortion; complications of anesthesia, malpresentation\u2013disproportion, intrapartum hemorrhage, and other complications; and significant increases in maternal deaths due to other (incomplete) abortion, unspecified hypertension, genitourinary tract infections, malnutrition, other disorders of the amniotic fluid, placental disorders, and antepartum hemorrhage (Appendix 3, available online at https://links.lww.com/AOG/C281).\nCURRENT STATUS\nThe National Center for Health Statistics reported 658 maternal deaths, 277 late maternal deaths, and 3,791,712 live births in 2018, yielding an maternal mortality rate of 17.4 per 100,000 live births and a late maternal mortality rate of 7.2 per 100,000 live births.8 There was a strong age-mortality gradient between age 20 and 44 years but no difference in death rates between women aged 40\u201344 compared with those aged 45\u201349 years (Appendix 4, available online at https://links.lww.com/AOG/C281). Maternal mortality rates were 2.5 times higher among non-Hispanic Black women compared with non-Hispanic White women and lowest among Hispanic women (37.1, 14.7, and 11.8 per 100,000 live births, respectively8).\nA majority of maternal deaths occurred due to direct obstetric causes (77.4%8). Figure 3A shows maternal deaths in 2018 by cause-of-death category. Less informative categories, namely, \u201cOther specified pregnancy-related conditions\u201d (ICD-10 O268) and \u201cOther maternal diseases not elsewhere classified\u201d (ICD-10 O99), were responsible for a large fraction of deaths, and hypertensive disorders, circulatory system diseases, and amniotic fluid and blood clot embolism were the most common clearly specified causes (Fig. 3A and B).\nSURVEILLANCE CONCERNS\nMisclassification of Deaths Among Women Aged 10\u201344 Years\nThere are several reasons to suspect continuing misclassification of some nonmaternal deaths (as maternal deaths) among women aged 10\u201344 years in 2018, including the lack of difference in maternal mortality rates between women aged 40\u201344 years compared with those aged 45\u201349 years (Appendix 5, available online at https://links.lww.com/AOG/C281). Discrepant temporal trends between related causes of death (Fig. 2A), and the high proportion of maternal deaths due to less informative causes of death are other indicators suggesting misclassification. Although obstetric causes of death on a death certificate (eg, preeclampsia and amniotic fluid embolism) would be unaffected by the incorrect use of the pregnancy checkbox, nonobstetric causes of death among nonpregnant women (eg, chronic hypertension and pulmonary embolism) would be misclassified as maternal deaths if the pregnancy checkbox was ticked erroneously. Nonmaternal deaths from hypertensive diseases among reproductive age women far exceed maternal deaths from chronic hypertension so that a small misclassification of nonmaternal deaths from hypertensive diseases (due to checkbox errors) would have a significant effect on maternal deaths from chronic hypertension (Appendix 5, https://links.lww.com/AOG/C281).\nEvidence of misclassification of nonmaternal deaths as maternal deaths is also seen in multiple causes-of-death information. A large proportion of deaths due to chronic hypertension, liver disease, other specified maternal conditions (ICD-10 O268), and late maternal death in 2018 were identified as maternal deaths based solely on the pregnancy checkbox (without other indication of a pregnancy-related complication; Appendix 6, available online at https://links.lww.com/AOG/C281).\nSeveral recent studies22\u201327 support the need for introducing corrective measures aimed at minimizing the misclassification of nonmaternal deaths among women aged 10\u201344 years. Potential remedies include requiring the specification of at least one pregnancy-related cause of death for all cases where the pregnancy checkbox is ticked, and a manual review of the causes of death listed on the death certificate or on the corresponding medical record in a hospitalization database (\u201cdatabase autopsy\u201d28). A related issue pertains to physician education regarding the \u201cunderlying cause of death\u201d concept and the need for accurately completing death certificates.\nLess Informative Causes of Death\nThe high rates of maternal death from less informative causes of death such as \u201cOther specified pregnancy-related conditions\u201d (ICD-10 O268) and \u201cDisease of the circulatory system complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium\u201d (ICD-10 O994) need to be addressed: Preventive insights can only be obtained with greater specificity in cause-of-death information. This concern, which also applies to late maternal deaths, may be addressed by requiring less informative pregnancy-chapter ICD-10 codes to be accompanied by codes from other chapters; for example, in cases of aortic dissection, the I chapter code for this condition (namely, ICD-10 I710) should accompany the less informative O chapter code (ICD-10 O994).\nCLINICAL CONCERNS\nFigure 3 shows the frequency of all cause-of-death categories in 2018, and highlights the importance of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, diseases of the circulatory system, obstetric embolism. The significant declines in deaths from preeclampsia\u2013eclampsia (Fig. 2A), medical and unspecified abortion, complications of anesthesia, intrapartum hemorrhage, and amniotic fluid embolism (Appendix 3, https://links.lww.com/AOG/C281) are highly encouraging.\nDespite the significant temporal increase in deaths due to adherent placenta, the absolute rate of such deaths was low, suggesting that obstetric care is addressing the rising frequency of this condition.29,30 Increases in maternal deaths from chronic hypertension, genitourinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, liver disorders, mental and central nervous system disorders and diseases of the respiratory system could represent true increases or (more likely) an increase in the misclassification of nonmaternal deaths from these conditions due to checkbox errors.\nConcerns regarding the reported temporal increase in maternal deaths led the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and others to support the creation of state-based Maternal Mortality Review Committees.31,32 Reports from such committees show that about half of all pregnancy-related deaths were caused by hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions, cardiomyopathy, and infection, and that more than 60 percent of pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.33 Patient-related factors, such as a lack of knowledge about warning signs (38%), health care professional-related issues including misdiagnosis (34%), and system-related factors, such as a lack of coordination between health care professionals (22%), were the most commonly identified contributors to such deaths.33\nSystematic reviews of maternal death are important because they can identify pertinent and emerging issues of concern. Some of the recent caveats emerging from the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom are notable, including the need for heightened awareness of cardiovascular diseases among women with chest pain, orthopnea or persistent tachycardia, and the unexpected number of deaths due to undiagnosed aortic dissection.34\nSOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF MATERNAL MORTALITY\nRacial differences in the maternal mortality rate in the United States indicate longstanding health disparities. However, maternal mortality rate differentials by race are not exclusive to the United States; recent reports from England reveal maternal death rates among Black women that are fivefold higher than those among White women.35 This comparison highlights the role of nonmedical determinants of maternal mortality\u2014race-based maternal mortality rate differences in England persist despite the National Health Service\u2019s providing free, high-quality medical care to all.\nRacial disparities in maternal mortality rates reflect many factors arising from racism36 including closely connected social determinants of health such as income, social status, education, access to health care, housing, the physical environment, social supports, health behaviors, and culture.12,37\u201339 The strong correlations and synergism between these factors ensure that vulnerable populations experience disproportionately high risks of outcomes such as maternal death.\nVulnerable segments of the population, especially non-Hispanic Black women, need to be supported through comprehensive and sustained public health programs that address preconceptional health and chronic conditions (at the individual level), implicit racial bias among health care professionals (at the interpersonal level), quality of care in hospitals predominantly serving non-Hispanic Black women (at the community level) and paid parental leave and extended health insurance (at the societal level).36 Such initiatives are also required to support vulnerable women and address social determinants of health across the entire population. This need is highlighted by the distribution of maternal deaths in 2018: 287, 205, and 105 deaths occurred among non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women, respectively.8\nCONCLUSION\nSeminal studies by the National Center for Health Statistics show that previously documented temporal increases in maternal mortality rates in the United States were an artifact of changes in maternal mortality surveillance. Although the pregnancy checkbox improved the identification of maternal deaths, there remains a need to address continued misclassification of nonmaternal deaths, and the proliferation of noninformative causes of death. Strengthening routine maternal death reviews at the hospital, state, and national level will lead to more informed and optimized obstetric practice, and diverse public health initiatives targeting the social determinants of health will reduce racial disparities. Although the state of maternal health in the United States is not as dire as portrayed until recently, there is substantial scope for preventing avoidable maternal death.\nREFERENCES\n1.
