      "feedback": "Your draft has strong anchors (NL5YYTLF2; IGP1Q4ZEJ) and a plausible three-regime framework, but it needs a tighter, executive 4–6 sentence house view with day-one decision relevance. Actionable edits: (1) distill to a single crisp house view that states one directional stance (e.g., base-case constructive for moats via AI uplift with regime-dependent risk) and a concrete implication for ROIC/FCF and a target range or price channel, then map all evidence to that view; (2) fix the causal chain by naming how AI-driven productivity lifts margins on durable franchises, how labor displacement weighs on consumption, and how policy tools (retraining/UBI) feed demand and valuations across Regimes 1–3 (cite NL5YYTLF2, S15934PBQ, RHXDOHQQX); (3) replace broad prose with explicit triggers and invalidations for each regime (e.g., unemployment in automation-exposed sectors rising to a stated threshold, retraining/UBI success rates, and tariff pass-through paths) using the precise sources (e.g., NL5YYTLF2; J99EM2TPZ; S15934PBQ; RHXDOHQQX); (4) prune unrelated micro-notes and tighten the alts to two concise lanes (Alt A Range/Pacaso; Alt B HeartSciences) anchored to near-term catalysts with 1–2 data-collection milestones; (5) quantify all key numbers from sources (automation exposure ~25%; ~36 million at risk; >70% tasks at risk; GM capex 10–12B through 2027; Ford EV capex up to 50B through 2026; ROIC vs cost of capital as the decision rule) and keep every assertion tied to a cited ID (e.g., IGP1Q4ZEJ, GM, WTNT85IPR, 22PL3Q360, EPJYXB7DX, J99EM2TPZ, U6HXAJR4J); (6) ensure all critical sources are covered and any conflicts are reconciled with a brief, explicit interpretation; (7) consolidate the near-term (0–3/3–6 months) blocks into one testable watchlist of 3–5 triggers with clear invalidation criteria (UBI/retraining failure, tariff derailment, or a materially slower GM/Ford cadence). This will yield a concise, decision-ready brief aligned to the SECTION FOCUS.",
