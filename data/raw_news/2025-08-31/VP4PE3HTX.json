  "description": "Australia and Nauru signed an agreement Friday to allow the Australian government to deport formerly detained people without valid visas to the tiny island nation.",
  "content": "Australia and Nauru signed an agreement Friday to allow the Australian government to deport formerly detained people without valid visas to the tiny island nation, the Australian Associated Press reported.\n\nUnder the memorandum of understanding, Australia will pay Nauru $267 million upfront once the first people arrive, followed by $46 million annually for the resettlement.\n\nThe move is being denounced by refugee advocates, some of whom say the deal could open the door to mass deportations without notice. Human rights organizations have protested deportations to Nauru since a report by the United Nations found \u201csystematic violations\u201d of the 1987 Convention Against Torture.\n\nTony Burke, Australia\u2019s Home Affairs minister, said in a statement that the memorandum \u201ccontains undertakings for the proper treatment and long-term residence of people who have no legal right to stay in Australia, to be received in Nauru.\u201d\n\nThe two countries struck a deal in February to allow Australia to deport three violent criminals to Nauru. They had been granted 30-year visas.\n\nAn Australian High Court decision in 2023 overturned the Canberra government\u2019s policy of indefinite detention for immigrants who could neither get a visa, in some cases because of criminal conduct, nor be deported because they would face persecution or harm in their home countries. More than 200 immigrants have been released from detention as a result of the case. Some were charged with further offenses after their release.\n\nBurke said the Nauru deal would target this group.\n\n\u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t have a valid visa should leave the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a fundamental element of a functioning visa system.\u201d\n\nIn a statement posted online, Jana Favero, deputy chief executive of the Asylum Seeker Resource Center, criticized the agreement, taking aim at the Labor Party government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\n\u201cThis deal is discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAt a time when the entire country has just voted for unity and rejected fear, rather than embrace this and show leadership, the Albanese Government has launched yet another attack on migrants and refugees.\u201d",

      "text": "Albanese Government makes secret deportation deal with Nauru for almost half a billion dollars\nRefugee organisations have slammed the Albanese Government for making yet another secret deal with Nauru, this time paving the way for mass deportations at a cost to the taxpayer of nearly half a billion dollars initially as well as another $70 million every year.\nA statement silently uploaded to the website late Friday afternoon showed that Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has secretly travelled to Nauru to sign an agreement with the Pacific nation. Past agreements with Nauru have been fraught with corruption, and in just August it was revealed that the leader of the notorious Finks bikie gang was promised $40 million in Australian taxpayers\u2019 money for security and policing.\nThe move gives context to the Government\u2019s attempts this week to sneak laws into the Parliament that would strip the right to fairness from decisions to deport people under this arrangement. They are expected to try to rush the laws through in the coming week.\nThis secret deal has real life implications for a huge number of people, opening the door to mass, without-notice deportations to harm under the powers the government gave themselves in their brutal Bills passed in the last sitting week of 2024, which have the potential to apply to over 80,000 people, tearing families apart and destroying lives forever.\nJana Favero, Deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:\n\u201cThe Albanese government has already thrown $13 billion of Australian taxpayers money down the toilet in these outrageous deals to inflict cruelty on people. These secret deals send one clear message \u2013 in Australia, some people will be punished simply because of where they were born. This deal is discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous. At a time when the entire country has just voted for unity and rejected fear, rather than embrace this and show leadership, the Albanese Government has launched yet another attack on migrants and refugees. An attack that will result in the most significant of outcomes \u2013 mass deportation.\u201d\nSarah Dale, Centre Director and Principal Solicitor at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service said:\n\u201cEarlier this year it was found by the UN that the Australian Government could not outsource their obligations to Nauru. The Government was found to have breached the human dignity of those it sent there. It\u2019s extraordinarily alarming, some months later, the Government proposes to send even more people warehoused offshore in yet another secret backdoor deal. Where does it end? The human cost, including that of family separation under this evolving offshore regime just continues to escalate.\u201d\nBethany Rose from the Visa Cancellations Working Group (a nationwide coalition of lawyers, academics and professionals) said:\n\u201cThis is policy-making at its worst. It takes Australia down a dangerous path: secret deals, avoidance of scrutiny, without-notice exiling of refugees; and outsourcing of key responsibilities at extreme human cost. We are talking about people\u2019s lives. Like anyone else, these people have served their time and restarted their lives in the communities, recovering after what may be years of indefinite detention. When the Government starts offshoring its citizens into responsibilities and dismantling key legal and accountability protections, we should all be gravely alarmed.\u201d\nMedia enquiries\nFor further information or to request an interview, contact Natasha Blucher (ASRC) on +61 412 034 821 or media@asrc.org.au\nLeave a reply\nConnect with us\nNeed help from the ASRC?

      "text": "What happens to Trump\u2019s tariffs now that a federal appeals court has knocked them down?\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has audaciously claimed virtually unlimited power to bypass Congress and impose sweeping taxes on foreign products.\nNow a federal appeals court has thrown a roadblock in his path, ruling that he is violating the law.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify imposing sweeping import taxes on almost every country.\nThe ruling largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York. But the 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling that would have overturned the tariffs immediately, allowing the Trump administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe ruling was a big setback for Trump, whose trade policies have rocked financial markets, paralyzed businesses with uncertainty and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.\nWhich tariffs did the court knock down?\nThe court\u2019s decision centers on the tariffs \u2014 export taxes \u2014 Trump imposed in April on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.\nTrump on April 2 \u2014 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.\nThe president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the United States \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the United Kingdom, Japan and the European Union \u2014 and agreed to lopsided deals with Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.\nThose that didn\u2019t knuckle under \u2014 or otherwise incurred Trump\u2019s wrath \u2014 got hit harder this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.\nClaiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring the United States\u2019 long-standing trade deficits \u201ca national emergency.\u201d\nIn February, he\u2019d invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs into the U.S. amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.\nThe U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Trump has made the most of it.\nThe court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.\nNor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that Beijing used unfair practices to give its technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.\nWhy did the court rule against the president?\nThe administration had argued that courts had approved President Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With the Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in the IEEPA.\nIn May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump\u2019s April 2 tariffs \u201cexceed any authority granted to the President\u2019\u2019 under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.\nOn Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \u201cit seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\u201d\nA dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday\u2019s ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \u201cis not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions,\u201d which have allowed Congress to grant some tariff authorities to the president.\nSo where does this leave Trump\u2019s trade agenda?\nThe government has argued that if Trump\u2019s tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it\u2019s collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \u201cfinancial ruin\u201d for the United States.\nIt could also put Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.\n\u201cWhile existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,\u201d Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.\nThe president promptly said he would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. \u201cIf allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\u201d he wrote on his social media platform.\nTrump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.\nFor instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.\nThe administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and autos. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed merely at the president\u2019s own discretion.\nWiseman and Whitehurst write for the Associated Press."

      "text": "- Share via\nSEOUL \u2014 In many parts of the world, convenience stores are the shops of last resort: cigarettes, sodas and laundry detergent. But in South Korea, you might find single malt whiskies, $800 French wines, 24K gold bars, shampoo and conditioner refill stations, televisions or a dine-in instant noodle bar with more than 200 varieties of ramyon.\nA customer might be able to pick up a package, wash and dry their clothes, or sign up for a new debit card.\nThe stores are best known for their numerous feats of \u201cinstant-izing\u201d food, a process in which nearly every conceivable dish is turned into a packaged meal: spaghetti, Japanese udon, fried rice that you squeeze out of a tube. These have turned convenience stores into a $25-billion industry in South Korea and those food products are churned out at a staggering pace: up to 70 new food items hit the shelves each week, effectively offering a live feed of South Korean tastes.\n\u201cIn South Korea\u2019s food retail market, you go extinct if you\u2019re not quick to change,\u201d says Chae Da-in, who says her obsession with convenience stores is decades old. \u201cIt\u2019s all about being diverse and fast.\u201d\nKnown in the national media and on social media as a \u201cconvenience store critic,\u201d Chae is the author of three books on the world of convenience store foods, which has led to TV appearances and newspaper interviews.\nEvery Friday, she tours a handful of convenience stores near her home to keep up with what\u2019s new. Over the last two decades, she estimates she has consumed at least 800 varieties of convenience store samgak gimbap \u2014 rice wrapped in dried seaweed and a grab-and-go staple.\nLee Hee Chul, 21, from Incheon, South Korea, cools down his ramyon in a DIY cone made from the ramyon bowl cover at a CU convenience store in a popular tourist area in Myeongdong.\nShoppers prepare their dinner at one of the self-serve machines in the dining area at a CU ramyon convenience store.\nIn recent years, Chae has watched her obsession go global. Much like South Korean movies, TV shows and music, South Korean convenience stores have become a cultural sensation.\nSpecific locations, such as the store that appeared in Netflix\u2019s hit series \u201cSquid Game,\u201d have made the news. On TikTok and YouTube, mukbang \u2014 videos of people eating \u2014 of South Korean convenience store foods have gathered millions of views.\n\u201cGiant cheese sausage,\u201d announces one reviewer in a TikTok video series titled \u201cONLY Eating Food from a Korean Convenience Store.\u201d The meal also includes blue lemonade that comes in a plastic pouch, a \u201c3XL\u201d spicy tuna mayo samgak gimbap and a carbonara-flavored Buldak (\u201cfire chicken\u201d) noodle cup.\nSouth Korean convenience stores are now expanding into nearby countries such as Mongolia or Malaysia. CU, one of the country\u2019s leading operators with more than 600 stores in Asia, is set to open its first U.S. location in Hawaii later this year.\n\u201cThe percentage of the Asian population in Hawaii is six times that of the mainland U.S., making it a place where there is a high level of familiarity and positive attitudes toward Korean culture,\u201d said Lim Hyung-geun, the head of overseas operations at BGF Retail, CU\u2019s parent company.\n\u201cOn top of that, we\u2019re seeing the sustained popularity of Korean culture, such as a Korean food boom among American teenagers and young people in their 20s and 30s, which we believe will be a big boost for CU\u2019s future expansion.\u201d\nLim calls CU\u2019s overseas locations \u201c\u2018miniature South Koreas\u2019 where people can experience the products that have become popular with the K-wave.\n\u201cBut as is the case here, K-convenience stores aren\u2019t just a place to experience South Korean culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also restaurants, cafes and a general amenity.\u201d\nIn other words, everything stores that are everywhere and open all the time.\n***\nLike many things South Korea has embraced and spun off into something novel, convenience stores are an import to the country. The first such store was American \u2014 the Southland Ice Co., which was founded in Texas in 1927 and changed its name to 7-Eleven in 1946. The first of the 7-Elevens opened for business in Seoul in the 1980s.\nToday, South Korea is the convenience store capital of the world. Like the bodegas of New York, they have become part of the fabric of contemporary urban life, multifunctional spaces that can be restaurants or coffee shops or bars with microwaves and outdoor seating. Chae calls them the \u201coasis of the streets.\u201d\n\u201cPeople hang out in convenience stores,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve become a social place.\u201d\nPart of what makes them such a force in the country is their sheer numbers.\nThere are around 55,000 convenience stores in South Korea \u2014 a country the size of Indiana \u2014 amounting to one convenience store for every 940 people. In Seoul, where their numbers have quadrupled in the last 15 years, it sometimes feels like there\u2019s one on every corner.\nMuch of this has to do with the fact that roughly one in every four workers in South Korea is self-employed, a high number relative to other developed countries. For those in this mom-and-pop economy, which includes older workers pushed into early retirement or others who have been boxed out of the traditional labor market, convenience stores offer the most accessible form of entrepreneurship.\n\u201cCompared to the hundreds of thousands it would cost to open another business, the main draw of convenience stores is that you can open one with starting capital as little as 20 million won [$14,000],\u201d said Oh Sang-bong, the head of social policy research at the Korean Labor Institute. \u201cOf course it\u2019s not easy. There are a lot of cautionary tales. But there are success stories, too.\u201d\n***\nThis profusion has made the convenience store business one of the most fast-paced and competitive in the country \u2014 one that moves in lockstep with boom-and-bust social media attention spans.\nHit products generate the kind of buzz you might see only for a limited-edition sneaker or the latest iPhone, necessitating preorders or, when inventories inevitably dry up, leading to scalping.\nBut the lows are abrupt. When it was first released last year, CU\u2019s \u201cDubai-style chocolate\u201d \u2014 an in-house take on the global TikTok food trend \u2014 commanded lines outside of stores and sold out in a day. Four months later, sales had dropped to a sixth of what they were.\n\u201cThe lifespan of products is now incredibly short because social media fads come and go so quickly,\u201d said Kim, a merchandiser for a leading convenience store franchise who asked to be identified only by his surname because he is not authorized to speak to the media.\n\u201cIn the past when the market wasn\u2019t so saturated, revenue would naturally rise as everyone opened more stores. But now there are so many stores, and then you\u2019re competing not just with other convenience stores but with e-commerce platforms, coffee shops, restaurants \u2014 everybody who\u2019s following the same trend.\u201d\nMost of Kim\u2019s job involves scrolling through social media platforms such as TikTok, looking for the next hot-ticket item, such as a distant food trend that shows signs of making landfall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brutal. It\u2019s like trying to find the eye of a needle over and over again,\u201c he said. \u201cIf you miss something big and a competitor releases it first? Then you\u2019re getting chewed out by your boss.\u201d\nWine for sale at a 7-Eleven convenience store. Snacks display K-pop idols. This vending machine dispenses gold bars. Prepared foods and side dishes at a convenience store.. Stores sell ready-to-eat foods such as sausages, fishcakes, chicken and sweet treats like bread, jelly and desserts.\nKwon Sung-jun is a chef who specializes in Italian cuisine and the winner of \u201cCulinary Class Wars,\u201d a hit reality cooking competition released by Netflix last year. He has a ritual of stopping by a convenience store every night after work \u2014 even if he doesn\u2019t have anything to buy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very useful for staying abreast of any trends in the culinary world,\u201d he said, and his routine proved to be pivotal in winning the $223,000 prize for \u201cCulinary Class Wars.\u201d\nIn one stage of the competition, contestants were tasked with cooking a dish using ingredients sourced from a true-to-life replica of a convenience store on set. Kwon, 30, handily won with a chestnut tiramisu whipped together from chestnuts, milk, coffee and a package of biscuits.\n\u201cI came up with the idea in 30 seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I had a mental list of what convenience stores have, I also planned substitute options for each of the key ingredients like chestnut, cream and so on.\u201d\nSince winning the competition, he has avoided convenience stores; just two weeks after that episode aired, CU released a mass-produced version of his tiramisu, with Kwon\u2019s face on the packaging.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing to see those photos of myself,\u201d he said.\n***\nAll of this makes running a convenience store no easy feat, says Kim Hye-ryeon, the 52-year-old owner of a GS25 in Seoul\u2019s Hongdae district.\nBecause franchisees are responsible for picking out their own inventory from the company catalog, which is updated three times a week, running a successful convenience store is less about the labor of stocking shelves and cashing out customers than keeping up with the frenetic cycle of food trends.\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a popular item, the owners who are a step ahead buy up all the stock so sometimes I can\u2019t get any for my store,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to know what\u2019s popular with young people at all times.\u201d\nIn recent years, as South Korea\u2019s cultural footprint has expanded, the assignment has gotten even more complicated. Streets that were once quiet are now popular thoroughfares for tourists staying in the guesthouses and Airbnbs that have opened in the area. Global tastes must be accounted for, too.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a noticeable increase since the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, it was mostly Chinese or Japanese tourists, but now it\u2019s from all over, especially Americans and Europeans.\u201d\nFrom behind the counter, she has been keeping mental notes of what this international consumer base is buying, noting, for example, how her Muslim customers carefully study the labels to check whether the item is halal.\n\u201cMost of the tourists come looking for products related to Korean movies or TV shows like dalgona [a traditional Korean candy] because they saw it on \u2018Squid Game,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey also really like ice creams, especially bingsu [Korean shaved ice].\u201d"

      "text": "Chicago mayor defies Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown plan for the city\n- Share via\nThe mayor of Chicago struck back Saturday against what he called the \u201cout-of-control\u201d Trump administration\u2019s plan to surge federal officers into the nation\u2019s third-largest city, which could take place within days.\nThe Chicago Police Department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to an executive order signed by Mayor Brandon Johnson.\nJohnson directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents \u201camidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.\u201d\nWhen asked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably \u201ctaking orders,\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cYeah, and I don\u2019t take orders from the federal government.\u201d\nJohnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal immigration officers have done since President Trump launched his crackdown.\nThe federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Friday and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.\nThe officials described the immigration crackdown as part of a larger effort to expand the federal law enforcement presence in major Democratic-run cities, as it did earlier this year in Los Angeles.\nOn Saturday, Trump commented about Chicago crime and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on his social media site: \u201cSix people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn\u2019t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we\u2019re coming! MAGA. President DJT\u201d\nUnlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, D.C., the Chicago operation is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration, rather than being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime, the officials said.\nChicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country\u2019s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda.\nJohnson\u2019s order builds on the city\u2019s longtime stance, saying neither Chicago nor Illinois officials have sought or been consulted on the federal presence and demanding Trump stand down on those plans.\nThe mayor had harsh words for Trump during his news conference, accusing the president of \u201cbehaving outside the bounds of the Constitution\u201d and seeking a federal presence in Democratic cities as retribution against his political rivals.\n\u201cHe is reckless and out of control,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest threat to our democracy that we\u2019ve experienced in the history of our country.\u201d\nIn response, the White House insisted the potential flood of federal agents was about \u201ccracking down on crime.\u201d\n\u201cIf these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email Saturday.\nCritics have noted that Trump, while espousing a tough-on-crime push, is the only felon ever to occupy the White House.\nBeck writes for the Associated Press."

In the United States, a federal appeals court has invalidated most of President Trump\u2019s emergency\u2011based tariffs, curbing his unilateral power and threatening a $159\u202fbillion revenue hit to the Treasury. The article also highlights South Korea\u2019s explosive convenience\u2011store industry, its rapid product churn, and its expansion into markets such as Hawaii.
