  "content": "Ten days ago none of us outside the tennis world had even heard of them. Now we know all about them. Perhaps. But not likely.\n\nNo matter, one is a white, female Latvian racist, even if she insists she\u2019s not. The other is a black, female American victim of racism, even if there\u2019s no proof beyond a wishful and distant maybe.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen such media rushes to harsh, defamatory and lasting judgments before. And they\u2019re not only wrong, they\u2019re hideously wrong, life-afflicting wrong and only the victims of the lies pay the price.\n\nFrom Tawana Brawley to the Duke lacrosse team. And in tennis, former ESPN analyst Doug Adler remains sentenced to life for a bogus tweet from a reckless New York Times stringer, the panicked cowardice of ESPN and a silent, reliably frightened media starting \u2014 and continuing \u2014 with the normally bold and outspoken ESPN center-courter stagers, John McEnroe and Chris Evert.",

      "text": "Booze, fights, damage \u2014 Bad behavior at the US Open is NYC at its finest\nA British friend said something snooty to me Wednesday night at the U.S. Open.\n\u201cUgh, this is so American.\u201d\nA concert fog machine had just turned on as World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz walked into Arthur Ashe Stadium, like he was Lady Gaga at MSG.\nOnce the match started, the 23,000 spectators talked the entire time.\n\u201cPlease try to keep your voices down,\u201d the Serbian chair umpire repeatedly implored in an exasperated tone that suggested these are her two least favorite weeks of the year.\nThe New York crowd couldn\u2019t care less and kept yapping away regardless.\nAnd, with seating rules mercifully loosened, folks got up to go buy cocktails right in the middle of points \u2014 stacking as many $23 vodka-lemonade Honey Deuce cups as Novak Djokovic has trophies. Why not? Spaniard Alcaraz was cruising to an easy victory. They were bored.\nThe U.S. Open is notoriously loud, garish, rude, drunk and completely indifferent to more than a century of decorum and tradition.\nThank God.\nI\u2019ve been to all four Grand Slams. Wimbledon is a stressful place. Shirts have buttons. And everybody acts primly like they\u2019re in the Royal Box next to Kate Middleton, even though they camped out overnight in tents to get a seat and haven\u2019t showered. The Australian Open is cheerful, yet \u201cno worries\u201d respectful. And the French Open is actually extremely obnoxious, but that often goes unsaid because, well, France.\nThe U.S. Open is tennis New York style.\nThe stadium\u2019s energy is so rowdy and impassioned that the players often lean into it. And juicy drama ensues. Think 39-year-old Jimmy Connors egging on the masses in 1991.\nIn that time-honored spirit, Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev, a hilarious spitfire \u2014 and stick figure \u2014 is never more cranked up than on the courts of Flushing Meadows.\nIn his first run to the finals in 2019, he infamously gave the crowd the finger and said that their booing fueled him.\nFind me a New Yorker who can\u2019t relate to that.\nThen, last Sunday, he had a seven-minute epic meltdown after a photographer strolled on the side of the court at the wrong time. Mad, mad Meddy smashed his racket on the bench.\nThe former champ taunted the umpire, like the official was a cab driver who didn\u2019t feel like driving to Brooklyn at 3 a.m.\n\u201cHe wants to go home, guys!\u201d he whined. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour.\u201d\nIn the end, it was Medvedev who paid. The Russian lost in Round 1 and was fined $42,500.\nThis is the dangerously high dose of cortisol that Queens administers to players.\nIt sure did for Latvian Jelena Ostapenko, who berated American Taylor Townsend Wednesday for having \u201cno education.\u201d\nSore loser Ostapenko was all bent out of shape that Townsend didn\u2019t apologize after winning a point in which her lucky ball clipped the net. It\u2019s a stupid, stupid, stupid old custom that\u2019s not unlike saying \u201cbless you\u201d after a sneeze. No one should ever do it.\n\u201cShe told me I have no class, no education, and to see what happens when we get outside the U.S.,\u201d Townsend said during her press conference.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\nSo am I!\nAnd Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas\u2019 Thursday kvetch has special meaning to U.S. tennis fans.\nHe was Tsitsi-pissed that Germany\u2019s Daniel Altmaier beat him, in part, by occasionally employing an underarm serve. You know, the one kids use.\n\u201cNext time, don\u2019t wonder why I hit you, OK?,\u201d Tsitsi said on a hot mic to his opponent after losing. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just saying, if you serve underarm . . . \u201d\nTicket-buyers booed. Crowds love the sneaky little serve, and in the States we do whatever it takes to win.\nIt was a cheeky, impudent underarm serve, you see, that paved the way for 17-year-old American Michael Chang\u2019s victory at the French Open in 1989 \u2014 one of the greatest moments in tennis history.\nThe shot is tasteless, impolite, goofy, clever and extremely entertaining.\nMuch like the U.S. Open itself.\nSo American."
