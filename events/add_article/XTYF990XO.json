      "summary": "BigBear.ai has fallen nearly 30% to $5, trading at a nine‑times trailing revenue multiple well above its historical average, yet analysts see a potential rebound to $10 if defense AI budgets accelerate, backlog converts to revenue, and geopolitical tensions sustain demand for AI‑enabled national security solutions. The company’s sizable $380 million backlog and recent DoD contracts could lift top‑line growth, while a higher operating margin would support a valuation closer to 18‑times sales. However, execution risk, $113 million debt, negative cash flow, and intense competition from larger defense contractors temper the upside, and the stock’s extreme volatility could trigger sharp drawdowns if funding or contracts falter.",
