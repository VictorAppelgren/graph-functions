But with inflation likely to remain elevated, gold's gains could remain capped beyond the expected initial bounce.\"\n\nPowell on Friday signalled a possible rate cut at the U.S. central bank's meeting next month, saying that risks to the job market were rising but inflation remained a threat, and that a decision wasn't set in stone.\n\nMarkets are now pricing in an 87% chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the September 17 policy meeting, and a cumulative 48 basis points of reductions by this year-end, according to CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nGold tends to appreciate in a low-interest-rate environment, which reduces the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.\n\nAsian share markets rallied on Monday as investors celebrated the likely resumption of rate cuts in the U.S.\n\nInvestors now await a reading on U.S. personal consumption prices on Friday that is expected to show core inflation creeping up to its highest since late 2023 at 2.9%.\n\nElsewhere, spot silver was down 0.1% at $38.77 per ounce, platinum fell 0.4% to $1,356.39 and palladium slipped 0.4% to $1,122.",

  "summary": "Gold slipped from a near two-week high as the dollar increased, but increased expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts also supported the metal. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $3,364.29 per ounce, after hitting its highest since August 11. The dollar index rose 0.3% to make it less attractive to overseas buyers. However, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish pivot last week contributed to support.

  "argos_summary": "Gold fell from a near two\u2011week high as the dollar strengthened, but Powell\u2019s dovish remarks have kept expectations of a U.S. rate cut alive, giving bullion some support. Spot gold traded at $3,364.29 per ounce, with futures easing to $3,409.60 for December delivery, while the dollar index rose 0.2%. Analysts see a near\u2011term support level around $3,350, noting that a sustained rally would likely need softer inflation and weaker employment data. Asian share markets rallied on the back of the anticipated Fed rate cuts, and other metals such as silver, platinum and palladium also slipped slightly.",
