That figure, currently penciled in to be paid out over years, would meet a demand from President Trump that Harvard spend more than double what Columbia University agreed last month to pay.

      "text": "President Donald Trump declared Friday that \"We are going to be taking away Harvard\u2019s Tax Exempt Status,\" saying \"It\u2019s what they deserve!\"\nThe announcement from Trump comes after Fox News reported last week that his administration asked the Internal Revenue Service to revoke Harvard University\u2019s tax-exempt status. The Ivy League school's failure to address antisemitism on campus is grounds for losing its 501(c)(3) status, sources said at the time.\n\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission. The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth. There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status,\" a Harvard University spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Friday, noting that Harvard provided more than $749 million in financial aid during fiscal year 2024.\n\"Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission. It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation,\" the spokesperson added. \"The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.\"\nIVY LEAGUE SUICIDES, PRINCETON'S 8TH STUDENT DEATH IN 4 YEARS EXPOSE CRISIS AT ELITE SCHOOLS\nTrump argued in mid-April that Harvard had \"lost its way\" and didn't deserve federal funding.\n\"Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and \u2018birdbrains\u2019 who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students and so-called \u2018future leaders,'\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Look just to the recent past at their plagiarizing President, who so greatly embarrassed Harvard before the United States Congress.\"\n\"Many others, like these Leftist dopes, are teaching at Harvard, and because of that, Harvard can no longer be considered even a decent place of learning, and should not be considered on any list of the World\u2019s Great Universities or Colleges,\" he continued.\n\"Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds,\" Trump also said.\nDemocratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts called Trump's announcement Friday an \"illegal action.\"\n\"Revoking Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status will have profound consequences far beyond its faculty and students. Harvard is a global leader in scientific research that produces cures and hope for patients and drives our innovation economy,\" she said. \"President Trump can\u2019t change a fundamental truth: There are no kings in this country.\"\nTyler Coward, the lead counsel for government affairs for the free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), added that \"Weaponizing the IRS and the tax code to attack the president\u2019s ideological opponents is a dangerous precedent that inevitably will be used by future administrations to penalize any nonprofit whose speech falls out of favor with those in power.\"\nHarvard has become a target of Trump\u2019s broader crackdown on universities, much of which is in response to last year\u2019s anti-Israel unrest that erupted on campuses across the country.\nOn April 11, the Trump administration sent a letter to Harvard University President Dr. Alan Garber and Harvard Corporation Lead Member Penny Pritzker outlining the institution\u2019s failures and a list of demands from the White House. In the letter, the administration accused Harvard of failing to uphold civil rights laws and to foster an \"environment that produces intellectual creativity.\"\nThe Trump administration threatened to pull federal funding if Harvard did not reform governance and leadership, as well as its hiring and admissions practices by August 2025. The letter emphasized the need for Harvard to change its international admissions process to avoid admitting students who are \"hostile\" to American values or support terrorism or antisemitism.\nTRUMP BRANDS HARVARD \u2018ANTISEMITIC' AND A \u2018THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\u2019 DURING FUNDING BATTLE\nHarvard refused to comply with the demands, with Garber saying that \"no government\u2026 should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\"\nThe Trump administration then froze $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard, and is reportedly looking to slash another billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe university later filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its \"unlawful\" freezing of funds.\nFox News' Andrea Margolis, Alexis McAdams and Rachel Wolf contributed to this report."

Ben Allen, a Democrat whose district encompasses UCLA, said the Trump administration's demand is \"harming the engines of American power, innovation, and, indeed, greatness.\"\nThe move came a day after California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized settlements between Columbia and Brown universities, both Ivy League schools, and the Trump administration.\n\"We\u2019re not Brown, we\u2019re not Columbia, and I\u2019m not going to be governor if we act like that,\" Newsom said while speaking in San Francisco. \"Period. Full stop, I will fight like hell to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\"\nColumbia will pay more than $220 million to resolve multiple federal civil rights investigations, including $21 million to settle claims of antisemitic employment discrimination against Jewish faculty after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel.\nBrown will shell out $50 million over a decade to state workforce development organizations as part of a deal struck with the U.S. government.\nIn July, UCLA agreed to pay $6 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Jewish students and faculty members over the school's handling of anti-Israel protests, including allowing protesters to ban Jews from a part of the campus known as a \"Jew Exclusion Zone.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe lawsuit was brought last year by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which accused UCLA of \"aiding and abetting\" an antisemitic culture, including \"segregating Jewish students and preventing them from accessing the heart of campus.\""

They knew they had an antisemitism problem,\" McMahon said ahead of her remarks at the National Governors Association (NGA) Summer Meeting in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\nThe settlement not only combats antisemitism on college campuses, it takes measures to remove discriminatory hiring practices and enhance campus safety, the education secretary explained.\nTRUMP SECURES $221M COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT OVER ALLEGED CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS\n\"This agreement is going to be an excellent template for other universities to be able to use as well,\" McMahon said.\nCOLUMBIA PROFESSORS DEMAND ANSWERS AS WHITE HOUSE FINALIZES NEGOTIATIONS WITH IVY LEAGUE UNIVERSITY\nSeveral Jewish leaders have spoken to Fox News Digital about the \"existential threat\" they say Jewish New Yorkers are facing since 33-year-old socialist Zohran Mamdani became the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City.\nDuring the primary campaign, Mamdani's refusal to condemn the phrase \"Globalize the intifada\" and recognize Israel as a Jewish state triggered accusations he was antisemitic.\nHe has since said he would discourage others from using the phrase and has continuously affirmed his commitment to condemning the rise of antisemitism in New York City.\nYuval David, a Jewish advocate and advisor, told Fox News Digital that Mamdani, as mayor, would \"enable, and more importantly, empower antisemitic protesters.\"\nIn light of the Columbia University settlement, Fox News Digital asked McMahon if the Trump administration was worried about a surge in antisemitism on New York City college campuses if Mamdani is elected in November.\n\"We didn't discuss that as part of what we were doing. We weren't looking at a specific incident that might occur in the future,\" McMahon explained.\nBut the education secretary said what is most important in Columbia University's settlement is that it will \"lay the groundwork, so regardless of what incidents may or may not occur, you're prepared for it.\"\nMcMahon said Columbia now has a \"great working relationship\" with the New York Police Department (NYPD).\nThe settlement includes Columbia's commitment to \"enforcing strict rules against disruptive protests, prohibiting masked protests and maintaining trained security officers and ongoing cooperation with the New York Police Department.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"They won't hesitate to bring them in to make arrests,\" McMahon warned. \"There will be consequences. People will be expelled. They'll be suspended. If there's criminal activity, they can go to jail.\n\"The accountability factor of this agreement is incredibly strong, and that's the message we intend to send, that students on campus need to be in an environment for study.\""

      "text": "President Donald Trump's targeting of Harvard University and other elite schools has been met with both praise and pushback among conservatives and free speech advocates.\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board accused Trump of exceeding \"his power under the Constitution\" in his demands to Harvard.\nThe Trump administration announced it would be freezing $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts on Monday after Harvard University president Alan M. Garber announced the same day that the school would not be complying with the Trump administration's demands to combat antisemitism.\n\"Few Americans will shed tears for the Cambridge crowd, but there are good reasons to oppose this unprecedented attempt by government to micromanage a private university,\" the editorial board wrote. \"The Administration runs off the legal rails by ordering Harvard to reduce 'governance bloat, duplication, or decentralization.'\"\nOBAMA PRAISES HARVARD FOR BUCKING TRUMP AMID FUNDING-CUT THREATS\nThe administration asked the university to make changes to adhere to \"merit-based\" hiring and admissions practices and reform its recruitment of international students to \"prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including students supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism.\"\nOther requested reforms included ensuring \"viewpoint diversity in admissions and hiring,\" changing programs with \"egregious records of antisemitism or other bias,\" and discontinuing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and initiatives.\n\"These reforms may be worth pursuing, but the government has no business requiring them. Its biggest overreach is requiring \u2018viewpoint diversity,\u2019 which it doesn\u2019t define. Does this mean the English department must hire more Republican faculty or Shakespeare scholars? An external monitor will decide such questions,\" the WSJ editorial board wrote.\n\"Congress can pass a law to advance Mr. Trump\u2019s higher-ed reforms, such as reporting admissions data. But the Administration can\u2019t unilaterally and retroactively attach strings to grants that are unrelated to their purpose. President Trump has enough balls in the air without also trying to run Harvard,\" the editorial board continued.\nNational Review's editors also took issue with some of Trump's efforts, writing that the administration was \"indulging in the Trumpian habit of making loud and explicit what was previously done with more subtlety.\"\nThey wrote, \"Obama and Biden administrations were relentless in using federal law to influence or outright dictate how universities were managed.\"\nThe editors argued that the government shouldn't have the power to monitor how universities are governed.\nNico Perrino, the executive vice president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), told CNN that though Harvard has a bad track record of protecting free speech on campus, the Trump administration\u2019s push to punish the institution tramples on its rights.\n\"This is a loaded gun. These same tools that the presidential administration is using right now to get some outcomes that maybe conservatives like, are the same tools that can be used by a liberal administration to get outcomes they don\u2019t like once the power changes hands,\" Perrino told CNN host Audie Cornish.\nFIRE's chief counsel, Robert Corn-Revere, said in a statement, \"President Trump suggested revoking Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status because of what he called \u2018political, ideological, and terrorist-inspired\u2019 ideas being expressed on campus. But retaliating against a university because of its curriculum or the views expressed by its students and faculty would violate academic freedom and the First Amendment. The president can't use the machinery of government to dictate which ideas are acceptable in higher education.\"\nCNN political commentator Scott Jennings argued during a panel on Wednesday that Harvard was going to have to deal with the president because they receive federal money.\n\"There's no diversity of thought among the faculty there,\" he said. \"They take federal money. They have a $53 billion endowment. They take federal money. If you want to continue to take federal money, you\u2018re going to have to listen to the people who dole it out. And that\u2019s the Trump administration who are standing up for these Jewish students. If they want to give up the federal money, you can create, I guess, the culture of all the culture of hate that you want, and that\u2019s fine. But right now they\u2019re entangled with the federal government, and they\u2019re going to have to deal with the president.\"\n5 CONTROVERSIES EMBROILING HARVARD AS TRUMP SEEKS TO CUT FUNDING\nPolitico Magazine's Evan Mandery, a Harvard alumnus, praised his university for fighting back, but noted that Harvard is \"an engine of economic inequality in America.\"\n\"If Harvard and its peers emerge reasonably intact after this episode, they should seize the chance to broaden their appeal and reform themselves to serve the public interest \u2014 not Trump\u2019s personal interest \u2014 by providing opportunity to many, rather than a privileged few,\" Mandery wrote.\nThe Manhattan Institute's Chris Rufo applauded Trump's actions and said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status, which the president asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to remove on Wednesday.\nHeather Mac Donald, also a Manhattan Institute fellow, deemed the Trump administration's efforts \"clumsy\" in a piece for the City Journal.\n\"The administration is growing ever bolder in its crusade against the institutions responsible for left-wing ideology\u2014whether elite law firms or universities. That crusade is unquestionably justified. Its targets deserve little sympathy. But a question arises: Is the administration more interested in maximal disruption or in achieving its long-term goals? The two aims may not be compatible,\" Mac Donald wrote.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nLiberal commentators have been largely critical of Trump's efforts, arguing that the demands go way beyond combating antisemitism on college campuses. However, former MSNBC host Chris Matthews suggested Tuesday that the president was \"smart\" to target elite institutions in light of the widespread anti-Israel protests that occurred across college campuses following the Oct. 7 terrorist attack against Israel.\nMatthews argued that students paying Harvard's tuition had a right to go to class, and that the school had to be told to do this in the wake of these protests.\n\"And the fact that they had to be told to do this, they had to be told to let students go to school, which is what this is about, that they had to be told to do, that they had a problem in their own heads. So I think the elite universities are taking a beating right now. It\u2019s probably a smart move,\" he added.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMatthews also said that the move would not hurt the president politically.\n\"It\u2019s Trump going after the elites. He knows what he\u2019s doing. Politically, it\u2019s not going to hurt him. I think these universities have enough money to cover their legacies. They\u2019ve got a lot of money to handle it. So they\u2019re going to be able to take care of themselves. I don\u2019t want to be loose about this, but I think Trump targeting these universities is probably not the worst move he ever made,\" he said.\nFox News' Gabriel Hays and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report."

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."
