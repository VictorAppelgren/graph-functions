  "content": "Rubik, a Ukrainian military drone pilot, had tracked the every move of one particular Russian soldier for weeks, with the promise of earning at least six points for killing him.\n\nIn a war increasingly dominated by drones, Ukraine\u2019s military has launched a new score-based purchasing system for units to replenish their stocks, and Rubik - his military nickname - was looking to help his brigade cash in.\n\nOn the \u201cBrave1\u201d platform launched by Ukraine\u2019s digital transformation ministry, new drones for the troops fighting Russia\u2019s invasion go for between two and a few dozen points.\n\n\u201cYou get the most points for infantry, so everyone is focusing on destroying manpower,\u201d the 22-year-old said at a bombed-out school in eastern Ukraine being used by his reconnaissance group of the 3rd Army Corps.\n\nThe Brave1 market has been dubbed by its creators the world\u2019s first military Amazon, because it allows brigades to choose their weapons and leave reviews.",
