For the various enzyme-bound flavins, competitive oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effects fall within the narrow range of 1.0266(5) to 1.0279(6), apparently because of the dominant contribution of outer-sphere reorganization to the activation barrier; within the context of semiclassical and quantum mechanical electron transfer theories, the magnitude of the isotope effects reveals the importance of nuclear tunneling.\nRecommendations received\n3 people have recommended Roseanne\nJoin now to viewOther similar profiles\nExplore top content on LinkedIn\nFind curated posts and insights for relevant topics all in one place.\nView top content"

Tekedra Mawakana, Co-CEO of Waymo, takes the Disrupt Stage to talk about where AVs actually stand, what it\u2019s taken to get to real deployments, and why the race isn\u2019t just about tech, it\u2019s about trust.

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions.

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.
