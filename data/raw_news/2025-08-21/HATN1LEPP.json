  "description": "This hike through Yosemite National Park features meadows, wildflowers and epic views. And as a huge bonus, it isn't crowded.",
  "content": "Taft Point offers grand views of El Capitan, Yosemite Falls and more. It can be accessed via multiple trails in Yosemite National Park.\n\nLet\u2019s just get this out of the way: Hiking through Yosemite Valley, whether it be to Vernal and Nevada falls or through Cook\u2019s Meadow, is a mesmerizing and special experience.\n\nThe hulking granite walls will remind you how small you are \u2014 and how remarkable our world is. Listening as waterfalls thunder down the mountain can place you in a meditative trance if you let it. The beauty of the valley is the best kind of sensory overload. It\u2019s the reason that, at times, Yosemite can feel a bit crowded and why so many Angelenos are willing to drive 5\u00bd hours north to reach it.\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to experience Yosemite\u2019s beauty without the crowds, then dear Wilder, I have a little treat for you. Last week, I visited the park with my friend Patrick in search of a hike around Yosemite Valley where we could still find solitude. I\u2019m so excited to share it with you!\n\nBefore we dive in, though, a few reminders:\n\u2022 Never trod off path into any of Yosemite\u2019s meadows, as they are sensitive habitats.\n\u2022 Check the weather before heading out; Yosemite\u2019s elevation varies widely, and it heats up in the summer, especially in the valley.\n\u2022 Pack accordingly \u2014 especially on day hikes \u2014 as rescue can take hours; your pack should include anything you\u2019d need should you have to spend the night outside.\n\u2022 Do not feed the wildlife, including squirrels. \ud83d\udc3f\ufe0f\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude45\n\u2022 In short, please practice Leave No Trace as you explore this national treasure.\n\nLast week, Patrick and I took a 10.4-mile journey to Taft Point, an epic lookout point that many hikers reach through a shorter 2.2-mile trek from the Sentinel Dome/Taft Point Trailhead. Let me tell you why, if your schedule and body allow, the long way is better.\n\nWe started our hike from our campsite in nearby Bridalveil Creek, one of about half a dozen campgrounds in Yosemite where you can book two weeks ahead, and walked .7 miles to the McGurk Meadow Trailhead, where around 11 a.m., there remained ample parking.\n\nI was concerned about how hot it would get since we had gotten a later start, but we were immediately shaded on the trail by tall evergreens amid a forest floor of ferns and other greenery. After a short jaunt through the woods, we spotted the green and golden grasses of McGurk Meadow, still dappled with wildflowers.\n\nAs we traversed the narrow dirt path, we stopped to observe the red paintbrushes, purply pink fireweed and yellow goldenrod growing along the trail. No one rushed past us as we debated whether a particular white flower was yarrow or something else. (It was something else.)\n\nAbout 1.8 miles from the trailhead, we reached the end of the McGurk Meadows Trail and continued northeast on the Pohono Trail. We\u2019d seen around eight people at this point, including SoCal-based photographer Jason Anderson who told us about a bear he\u2019d spotted ahead on the trail. (More on bears later!)\n\nWe arrived at Bridalveil Creek shortly thereafter, just over two miles in. We crossed a wooden bridge that takes hikers over the waterway, pausing to observe rainbow trout and chat with a hiker who\u2019d spent the night in a nearby backcountry camp. This creek appeared to be the only water source this late in the summer, so if you have a filter and need to refill your bottles, this is where you should stop.\n\nAs we hiked through more pine forest, past yellow California coneflower and purple Sierra Larkspur, I asked Patrick: \u201cDoes this hike feel like a \u2018Yosemite hike\u2019? Or was this like any other walk in the woods?\u201d\n\nPatrick paused to consider. We\u2019d already passed a large pristine meadow. We\u2019d seen several wildflowers still blooming and the crystal clear river still flowing despite the August heat. And we were almost always hiking under the shade of giant trees.\n\nStill, when you are hiking in Yosemite, you\u2019re expecting to experience the cream of America\u2019s national park crop. Patrick confided in me that although he\u2019d enjoyed everything so far, much of his expectations for our hike would depend on what we observed at Taft Point.\n\nUnlike me, he hadn\u2019t Googled it before coming on the trip and didn\u2019t know what to expect. And although I\u2019d seen the images, I feared this: What if it\u2019s all just clever Instagram angles, and this turns out to be a waste of precious time? (I am perpetually concerned about letting you down, dear Wilder!)\n\nThen, just under four miles from the trailhead, the landscape shifted from pine forest to boulders and short trees and shrubs. We spotted a short metal railing and marched over boulders to the outlook. I gazed down at Yosemite Valley, my fears about the trail\u2019s splendor (or lack thereof) dissipating. El Capitan, which rises over 3,000 feet above the valley floor, was in full view. Yosemite Falls, mostly dry this time of year, was easy to spot.\n\nI went to check out the famous rock outcropping I\u2019d spotted online. Patrick, who was rapidly discovering his fear of heights, stayed at the railing to take my photo. I marveled all around me at all that rivers and glaciers had carved over millions of years.\n\nTaft Point was the busiest point of our hike, but it was still easy enough to find a spot in the shade to enjoy our lunch. We saw fewer than 20 people on the trail and just a few dozen total at Taft Point. It never felt crowded.\n\nAs we headed back, I remarked to Patrick how surprised I was not to see a single bear given how few people were on the trail. I learned why when we met a group of about eight kids from South L.A. swimming in Bridalveil Creek.\n\n\u201cWe saw four bears!\u201d one of them shouted to us.\n\nOne of their chaperones showed us a picture of a bruin just off trail. I chuckled to myself. The children\u2019s joy over the sightings was infectious. And we still got to see squirrels, chipmunks, woodpeckers, blue jays and one deer just a few feet off trail (who wasn\u2019t particularly concerned about our presence).\n\nI understand that writing about a less crowded hike in Yosemite will undoubtedly mean more people take this path. I heard similar complaints when I wrote about Kings Canyon last year. This is why I try to always include Leave No Trace principles and encourage hikers to respect the space.\n\nAdditionally, I hope my words not only inspire you to visit Yosemite but also to do further research, as this is only one of several less-crowded hikes in the park. Given the park\u2019s fever-pitch overcrowding, I was surprised to learn just how easy it remains to be alone in Yosemite!\n\nI hope you find a similar solitude, should that be what your heart needs.\n\n1. Enjoy the dog days of summer in L.A.\n\nL.A. County Parks and Recreation will host its Pooches in the Pool event on Saturday morning at two county pools. Dogs can swim at Ted Watkins Memorial Park (1335 E. 103rd St.) or Don Knabe Community Regional Park (19700 S. Bloomfield Ave. in Cerritos). Swim times are split between small and large dogs, with small dogs swimming from 9 to 10 a.m. and large dogs from 10 to 11 a.m. Learn more at parks.lacounty.gov.\n\n2. Hike and swim with new pals in Malibu\n\nThe Just Trek Crew will celebrate its sixth anniversary with a hike and beach day from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday in Malibu. The group will hike 2.5 miles and then dance and lounge on a secluded beach in Malibu. Register at partiful.com.\n\n3. Soak up the stars in Beverly Hills\n\nTreePeople will host a moonlight hike Friday in Coldwater Canyon Park in Beverly Hills. The event starts at 7 p.m. with a performance by local musicians. Guided hikes will start at 8 p.m., and the group will be split among those taking easy, moderate or strenuous routes. Tickets are $20 per adult and $10 per child under 15. Register at treepeople.org.\n\nThe bohemian enclave of Topanga Canyon has a new celebrity resident: a roughly 175-pound female black bear known as Yellow 2291, reports Times staff writer Andrew Campa. The 5- to 7-year-old bruin recently gave birth to three cubs, and wildlife officials say the quartet is the first black bear family to reside in the Santa Monica Mountains in years. Thanks to a tracking tag applied to the mama bear by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, officials know she has an extensive travel history, traversing at least 100 miles across L.A. County before landing in Topanga Canyon. If you happen to spot her and her babies, please give them a wide berth. It\u2019s always best to respect the locals!\n\nREI\u2019s annual Labor Day sale starts tomorrow and runs through Sept. 1. You will find 25% off REI Co-op brand tents, sleeping bags and sleeping pads and other deep discounts on the brand\u2019s clothing. I plan to take advantage of the 25% off all Darn Tough socks, my favorite brand of (blister-free!) hiking socks, which I reviewed in last year\u2019s holiday Gift Guide from The Times. This is also a great time to grab a discounted Garmin inReach Mini 2, which will enable you to keep in touch with loved ones while out in the wild. Have fun out there!\n\nFor more insider tips on Southern California\u2019s beaches, trails and parks, check out past editions of The Wild. And to view this newsletter in your browser, click here.",

      "text": "5 lifesaving tips for when you spot a bear on the trail\n- Share via\nI was drifting to sleep in my tent, soothed by the crisp night air, when I heard one word that jarred me back to reality.\n\u201cBear!\u201d\nIt was just after 10 p.m. at the Sentinel Campground in Kings Canyon National Park, and I was alone in my tent. I shined my flashlight around my campsite and confirmed that I had no unexpected visitors. I listened as campers farther away shouted \u201cBear!\u201d as it moved past their campsites, the sound echoing around like we were all playing a forest version of Marco Polo where the bear was \u201cit.\u201d\nIt was unsettling to not know exactly where our visitor was. But soon enough, the campers closest to the bear shooed it away. I lay back down, assuming the excitement was over for the night. Just as I was falling back asleep, I heard it again: \u201cBear!\u201d\nThis one \u2014 a small brown bear \u2014 decided to come my way, walking about 20 feet from my tent before hopping onto a log, walking its length and then wandering off to another corner of the campground.\nThat was both the closest I\u2019ve ever been to a bear outside of the zoo and the only time I\u2019ve seen a bear in the wild outside of a car. It underscored two things for me: just how thin my tent\u2019s walls were and that I needed to learn more about how to react should a bear come my way.\nAn estimated 65,405 black bears live in California, with the majority in Northern California and the Sierra Nevadas, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Southern California has a relatively small portion of those bears \u2014 an estimated 3,167 (depending on which regions you include in your count). Despite that, one of the biggest hot spots in the state for human and black bear conflict, according to wildlife officials, is in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. That \u201cconflict\u201d is mainly reports of property damage, loss of livestock and other unwelcome behavior.\nNot only that, but we have the possibility to see them year-round because bears in the L.A. area generally don\u2019t hibernate.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no reason to,\u201d said Jake Owens, director of conservation at the Los Angeles Zoo. \u201cDuring the wintertime, there\u2019s still food, and it doesn\u2019t get so cold that they need to really conserve energy by hibernating.\u201d\nDespite all those factors, dangerous bear encounters are rare.\n\u201cThe amazing thing about Los Angeles is that we have all this wildlife in and around our neighborhoods and so infrequently does anything happen,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThat says ... the relative threat is really low. The more you can do to reduce it even further and help us coexist is just a benefit.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the goal of today\u2019s Wild. I\u2019ve put together some tips so that if you ever see a bear while hiking, you\u2019ll know what to do. They\u2019re also helpful if you run into a bear in your neighborhood or, like me, your campsite.\nA quick note: Although some of it might still be relevant, this guidance is about how you respond if you see a black bear, not a grizzly bear. If visiting an area with grizzly bears, be sure to talk with rangers and other local experts who can provide guidance for best practices in that area.\n1. Don\u2019t run\nHow you react to a bear depends on several factors, including the distance you are from the bear, how it\u2019s acting and how it reacts to you.\nBut the one thing you absolutely must not do is run. You will look like prey. Every expert I spoke with emphasized this.\nAlso, don\u2019t climb a tree. Bears can climb trees quite well. Stay on the ground.\n2. Let bears know you\u2019re there\nAs lovely as the serenity of the woods is, it\u2019s important to make some noise while you\u2019re hiking, whether that\u2019s talking in a low voice or noisy footsteps, to let bears and other wildlife know you\u2019re there.\nI often hike alone with my dog, Maggie May, and because of that, I will frequently let out a loud \u201cHey-ooo,\u201d to let everyone know I\u2019m around. (Occasionally, a nearby hiker will answer back.) Owens, with the L.A. Zoo, told me that making noise like this is important because it lets any bears around know there\u2019s a human nearby.\nThe same goes for when you actually see a bear.\nIf you see one far in the distance that\u2019s headed away from you, it\u2019s still important to let the bear know you\u2019re there. Say something loudly and calmly \u2014 don\u2019t shriek! \u2014 like \u201cHey, bear!\u201d in a deep voice. Bears have a keen sense of hearing, and it likely will hear you and run far away. (Bears also have great noses, so if the wind is right, it might also smell you from a quarter mile away.)\n\u201cIf it\u2019s headed toward you, again, make sure you know that it knows you\u2019re there,\u201d Owens said. \u201cTalk loudly in as deep a voice as you can get. Put your hands up and out \u2014 don\u2019t shake them around \u2014 but make yourself look big, and try to get the bear\u2019s attention without indicating that you\u2019re scared or that you\u2019re a threat to that bear.\u201d\nOwens suggested making a motion with your arms similar to that of making a snow angel, slowly waving and being big. You can also open up your jacket if you\u2019re wearing one to appear even bigger.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not trying to shock it, and you\u2019re not trying to make it seem like you\u2019re scared and that it can come and chase you away,\u201d Owens said. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here. Know that I\u2019m here. Please get off the trail.\u2019\u201d\nAdditionally, if you have a child with you, you should either pick your child up, or if too large to pick up, put that child directly behind you. And you want to make sure your child knows to stay calm and not scream.\n\u201cTalk to the child loud enough for the bear to hear, and tell them, \u2018It\u2019s a bear, and we\u2019re sharing the trail,\u201d Owens said. \u201cKeep on facing it so you\u2019re not turning your back to it.\u201d\nIf you have a dog, the dog might scare the bear away before you have to take any action, Owens said. However, if your dog is barking and growling, and that\u2019s upsetting the bear, it\u2019s good to either pick up your dog or pull it close and stop it from barking.\n3. Keep your eye on the bear\nNow that you\u2019ve made yourself big and the bear knows you\u2019re there, it\u2019s important to keep your eye on the bear.\nBut don\u2019t look it in the eye. That can be seen as you threatening the animal or that \u201cyou think you are more dominant or that you\u2019re going to come after them, so they can become more afraid, and they can become territorial, especially if it\u2019s a male,\u201d Owens said.\n4. Observe its behavior and react accordingly\nOK, so now you\u2019re being big, you\u2019re talking to the bear and keeping your eye on it.\nTake a moment to understand why the bear is coming toward you. Does it have cubs? Is there a cub behind you? Is the bear scared or trying to scare you? When a bear is walking toward you, oftentimes, Owens said, it\u2019s because there\u2019s something in that direction it wants.\nWhen bears feel threatened and want to scare you, they will chomp their teeth and huff, Owens said. The most frightening thing they\u2019ll do is bluff-charge, where they\u2019ll run at you, and then some distance away, they will stomp on the ground and huff loudly.\nIf a bear bluff-charges you, you need to leave immediately. \u201cThat\u2019s the bear saying, \u2018You\u2019re too close, you need to get away from me, you\u2019re scaring me, I feel threatened,\u2019\u201d Owens said.\nYou should start slowly backing away, Owens said, telling the bear, \u201cOK, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\nIf the bear is just standing on the trail looking at you, then you should also start backing away. The bear still wants space but hasn\u2019t indicated it yet, Owens said. As you back away, keep talking to the bear, telling it you\u2019re leaving.\n\u201cBears are extremely smart animals, and so it can tell from your voice, it can tell from tones\u201d how you\u2019re feeling, Owens said.\nOftentimes, in the Santa Monica and San Gabriel mountains, the trail has a steep cliff on one side and a shear drop-off on the other, meaning neither you nor the bear can easily move off trail.\nIn that instance, \u201cJust keep on backing up,\u201d Owens said. \u201cKeep your eye on the bear. As you go around a corner, maybe speed up a little bit until you can see the bear again, and you might have to go back a ways until the bear can find an easy place where it can go down or up as well. But just keep on talking to it and keep your eye on it. But you do not want to run away. You do not want to go toward the bear at all.\u201d\n5. Carry bear spray\nThe National Park Service advises: \u201cOnly use your bear spray when the bear is charging or attacking you.\u201d\nThat said, if it\u2019s a windy day, or if the wind is blowing toward you, you could end up with a face and lungs full of bear spray. Make sure you know how to deploy it long before you ever need to use it.\nThat covers what you should do on the trail. When camping, you should always store your food in a bear box. Owens adds an additional layer of protection: he places all his food and toiletries in a thick black trash bag within the bear box to cut down on any odors. This helps deter bears from coming to the campground in the first place.\nThat said, not all campgrounds in Angeles National Forest have bear boxes. In that case, officials advise storing your food in your car and covering it. Luckily Angeles National Forest hasn\u2019t had incidents of bears breaking into cars, like some national parks have. And although still not ideal, it\u2019s better than leaving all your food out and around your campground, where bears could easily reach it and develop bad habits.\nRemember, it\u2019s rare to see a bear in Angeles National Forest.\n\u201cIf you see a wild bear in a wild place doing wild things, consider yourself incredibly lucky,\u201d said Dana Dierkes, public affairs officer at Angeles National Forest.\nLet\u2019s do our part to keep them wild.\n3 things to do\n1. Collect data on a Spanish-language evening hike in Agoura Hills\nJoin rangers for a Spanish-language hike from 5:30 to 7 p.m. Sunday to collect data at the Paramount Ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains. Participants should meet at the Biodiversity Booth at the dirt parking lot before heading out. It\u2019s one of many free events during Hispanic Access Foundation\u2019s Latino Conservation Week, which aims to increase access and involvement of Latinos in the outdoors. You can learn about hikes, biking, yoga, talks and other activities on the lineup by visiting the week\u2019s list of events. To register for the Spanish-language hike, visit eventbrite.com.\n2. Explore the ocean\u2019s microscopic diversity in Huntington Beach\nSure, sharks, whales and dolphins are great, but have you ever wanted to know about the tiny things teeming around in the tide? You can help monitor phytoplankton at Bolsa Chica State Beach through a community science effort from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. Friday. You\u2019ll collect an ocean water sample and use on-site equipment to observe the microscopic organisms living in it. The event is part of the Amigos de Bolsa Chica\u2019s FLOW, a community-based water quality research program aiming to better address pollution in the region. No previous experience is necessary, and training is ongoing. Learn more at amigosdebolsachica.charityproud.org.\n3. Let the kiddos get their hands dirty in Pasadena\nHave some cooped-up kids? Head over to Patagonia Pasadena, 47 N. Fair Oaks Ave., for \u201cKids Day: Planting and Crafting.\u201d Children will learn about button making and have other crafting opportunities; they can also learn about a local farmers market. Capri Kasai, from Arlington Garden in Pasadena, will teach children about breeding or reproducing of plants. Bonus: Kids will have the opportunity to take home their own plant friend. No registration is required. For more information, visit the event page.\nThe must-read\nIt\u2019s easy to descend into a doom spiral over climate change. But one of the most important messages you\u2019ll find in The Times\u2019 special project, Our Climate Challenge, is from Kristina Dahl, a principal climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists: Keep trying. That\u2019s not to say that our lives in L.A. won\u2019t change. In her contribution to the package, Times environment reporter Hayley Smith outlines how climate change will alter our lives in L.A. We\u2019ll drive less, sweat more and say goodbye to our lush, green lawns. We\u2019ll also probably phase out our iconic palm trees, replacing them with native trees that provide actual shade. \u201cWe need to count tree canopy and its maintenance as an infrastructure investment,\u201d said Marta Segura, L.A.\u2019s chief heat officer. \u201cWe should no longer look at it as something that\u2019s nice to have, and not even as just the lungs of the city. It actually reduces the temperature and the urban heat island like no other solution.\u201d\nOur Climate Challenge publishes in print Sunday. You can find a copy where papers are sold, buy one online or read the content on our site.\nI know it\u2019s hard, but I do have hope \u2014 in you, me and young activists like those included in this project \u2014 that we can band together and save our planet from the worst of this.\nHappy adventuring,\nP.S.\nI have something to add to your list of cool seasonal animal behaviors in California. Samuel P. Taylor State Park, about an hour northwest of San Francisco, is one of the only state parks with an active salmon run. From about October through December, you can watch the fish cross Lagunitas Creek, which runs through the park.\nFor more insider tips on Southern California\u2019s beaches, trails and parks, check out past editions of The Wild.

Share sensitive information only on official,\nsecure websites.\nThe lush beauty of a meadow inspires a natural simplicity, yet meadow ecology is one of the most complex sciences. John Muir described the Sierra Nevada's intricate meadows as \"so complete that you cannot see the ground and, at the same time, so brightly enameled with flowers and butterflies that it may well be called a garden-meadow, or meadow-garden.\" Ranger Carl Sharsmith peeked underneath the vegetation, where, upon one occasion, he found a shiny black Mount Lyell salamander\u2014rarely seen since its earlier 1915 discovery\u2014beneath a monkeyflower along a cold stream in a moist alpine meadow.\nMeadows are sponges, absorbing water as snowpack melts and holding that water like an underground water tower. At just 3% of Yosemite National Park's area, meadows contain a much larger proportion of Yosemite's species. Recently, in 2003, an entirely new species of orchid, called the Yosemite bog-orchid, was discovered in Yosemite's meadows. It's possible, in fact, that one-third of all of the plant species found in Yosemite occur in meadows. In terms of wildlife, a large portion of the park's animal populations, such as willow flycatchers, mule deer, and small mammals such as the Belding's ground squirrels and pocket gophers, depend on meadow habitat to feed or breed. And, people benefit, too: Most of San Francisco's water is filtered by Yosemite's meadows. Meadows, as biologically rich sponges, have absorbed the attention of California's scientists, therefore. Ecological studies of Yosemite's meadows began in the mid-1960s and many others continue today.\nIn the simplest terms, what defines a meadow? Hydrology, vegetation, and soil characteristics. Note that \"meadow\" is not a technical term as much as a cultural term. Classification systems, set by state and federal regulation, often set detailed guidelines that differ as to what constitutes a meadow. Sierra Nevada scientists who study meadows, therefore, have come to a consensus:\nA meadow is an ecosystem type composed of one or more plant communities dominated by herbaceous species.\nIt supports plants that use surface water and/or shallow ground water (generally at depths of less than one meter).\nWoody vegetation, like trees or shrubs, may occur and be dense but not dominant.\nWetland types, namely wet meadows and fens, typically form what are referred to as meadows in the Sierra Nevada.\nAlthough 3% sounds like a small percent of meadow habitat today within Yosemite, this tiny fraction mirrors the amount the park had more than a century ago as well as the amount of meadow habitat present in the broader Sierra Nevada range. Especially known for its meadow complexes in Wawona, Tuolumne and Yosemite Valley, Yosemite National Park supports approximately 3,000 meadows that range in elevation from 3,300 feet to more than 12,000 feet. Visualize meadows, perhaps, as \"islands\" of high diversity\u2014in a network of habitat patches. Meadows in Yosemite are believed to have been stable for approximately the past 10,000 years, since close to the time of the last ice age.\nHistory of Yosemite's Meadows\nWhen Euro-American settlers first set their eyes on Yosemite's meadows in the 1850s, large meadow complexes were surrounded by open conifer forests and oak woodlands. Deer and small mammals probably lightly grazed the meadows. Conditions rapidly changed as settlers transported stock, both cattle and sheep, onto Yosemite Valley meadows and often planted non-native forage species for grazing purposes. Summer grazing at higher elevations by \"hoofed locusts,\" as Muir referred to domestic sheep, could denude a landscape. In the 1860s, grazing in the mountains increased due to droughts in the Central Valley\u2014during the peak of the wool industry after the decline of the Gold Rush. Joseph LeConte, in 1870, observed: \"Tuolumne Meadows are celebrated for their fine pasturage. Some twelve to fifteen thousand sheep are now pastured here. They are divided into flocks of about twenty-five hundred to three thousand.\" Use of meadows by sheep declined shortly after 1900. Settlers also influenced meadow ecology by stopping anthropogenic burning of the meadows by the American Indians. From an ecological viewpoint, it is likely that fire historically promoted meadow stability by reducing the encroachment of surrounding forests; however, based on the observed geologic stability of many of Yosemite's meadows, it is unlikely that those Indian fires were key to maintaining all meadows. Today, more than a century later, it remains a huge scientific (and management) challenge to decipher the relative impacts to Tuolumne Meadows of a variety of factors\u2014including historic sheep grazing and burning, more \"modern\" infrastructure developments, current recreational use, and documented climatic changes like less snowpack and earlier snowmelt.\nHow Meadows Develop Until recently, typical academic theory taught botanists that meadow development resulted from succession\u2014a glacial terrain that evolves into a lake, a meadow and then a forest. We know now that not all meadows are part of this successional path: not all will change at some future point into a forest. Meadow location, rather, is determined by topography. On the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, for instance, meadows occur in situations where a relatively flat landform is surrounded by steep terrain with a large watershed that offers a shallow water table and fine textured soils.\nIdentifying Zones of Wetness During spring, rising groundwater levels and streams inundate meadows, bringing nutrients that sustain the landscape. Water table and soil moisture gradients strongly influence vegetation composition and structure in these wetlands. Most meadows contain a complex mosaic of wet, moist, and dry areas that support distinctly different plant and animal communities. Wet areas (or wetlands, including fens and riparian wetlands) are flooded or saturated with water for much of the growing season with sufficient moisture during the late-growing season to nurture plants through the critical reproductive stage. Fens, which make up the wettest portions of wet meadows, allow for a slowed decomposition of dead plant litter promoting at least 40 centimeters of peat accumulation in the top 80 centimeters of soil. Fens can be found in Yosemite at various sites, including Happy Isles in the Yosemite Valley, Crane Flat, Badger Pass, and Virginia Canyon. Moist areas may be flooded soon after snowmelt but do not always stay saturated through the growing season due to a lowering of the water table or a lack of precipitation. Drier areas with \"xeric\" meadow plants are often on the meadow margin but may be scattered throughout on high spots with a deeper water table. Meadow elevation also strongly determines the types of vegetation that occur due to differences in growing season length, climate, soil development, and glacial history. \"Montane\" meadows are low enough to be surrounded by forest (a 3,000- to 8,000-foot elevational band). \"Subalpine\" meadows are near the upper limit of trees (8,000 to 9,500 feet). \"Alpine\" meadows are, by definition, above tree-line and are generally surrounded by rock and boulders (above 9,500 feet). Yosemite's wet meadows support plants called hydrophytes that have structural, morphological and life-cycle adaptations allowing them to survive in an oxygen-deprived conditions. A true wetland incorporates a high water table that causes waterlogged and anaerobic (or oxygen lacking) conditions that wet meadow vegetation can tolerate but is inhospitable to competing upland vegetation communities. Some slow-growing wetland plants then adapt, in part, through a pressurized gas flow: air that moves into the aerial leaves (positioned above the water) and is forced down through the stem into the roots by a slight pressure generated by temperature and water vapor pressure.\nSpecific to Sierra Nevada's Meadows\nHow do Sierra Nevada meadows differ from meadows in other parts of the country? The Sierra Nevada's deep snowpack, relative to other mountain systems, is a critically important source of water for high-elevation meadows. California has a \"Mediterranean\" climate with very little summer precipitation compared to other parts of the country. Therefore, while meadows elsewhere may depend on year-round precipitation, Sierra Nevada meadows rely on shallow underground water supplied by snowmelt. Finally, the Sierra Nevada is dominated by granitic bedrock, which supports wet meadows with a neutral to slightly acidic pH runoff rather than an alkaline runoff.\nMeadow's Many Functions Besides supporting species not found elsewhere, meadows offer many functions. Meadows, for instance, filter sediment from water flowing from surrounding slopes\u2014providing clean water for wildlife and healthy habitat for aquatic animals that live in lakes and streams. Meadows provide an important breeding ground for invertebrates that form one base of the food web; meadow invertebrates are a key food source for many birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Meadow plants also provide food and habitat structure for small mammals that, in turn, provide an important prey base for raptors, coyotes, and other predators. Individual wetlands can provide different functions\u2014for instance, one can provide excellent flood or pollution control while another offers groundwater recharge capabilities.\nChallenging Meadow Health\nThough Yosemite\u2019s meadows exhibit long-term stability, they are potentially very sensitive to human-caused changes. High-elevation meadows have a short growing season with relatively shallow soil and may be very sensitive to even small changes in water availability. Even in protected wilderness areas, human-induced factors of change include altered precipitation (especially the timing and amount of snowmelt), trampling, grazing, roads, non-native plants, air pollutants, and altered fire regimes. Any factor that alters the underlying hydrology of meadow systems has the potential to shift species composition of these mountain wetlands.\nWithin Yosemite, large declines in meadow area have been witnessed within Yosemite Valley. In the late 1800s, narrative accounts indicate that Yosemite Valley\u2019s meadows were wetter and more vast than they are now. Scientists have determined the Valley\u2019s meadow acreage has decreased by about half today\u2014from more than 700 acres to just over 300\u2014due to farming activities like plowing and seeding and to fire suppression.\nG.G. Goucher, a Yosemite state commissioner, in 1889: \u201cThere is not any lady who visits Yosemite Valley that is apt to go on to those marshy meadows. I know that the meadow between Barnard\u2019s and Cook\u2019s, which is fenced, but which has not been plowed, a great deal of it is under water, which is backed up from overflows.\u201d\nGalen Clark in 1894, reflecting on four decades: \u201cMy first visit to Yosemite was the summer of 1855. At that time, there was no undergrowth of young trees to obstruct clear open views in any part of the valley from one side of the Merced River across to the base of the opposite wall \u2026 the area was clear open meadow ground, with an abundance of luxuriant native grasses and flowering plants, at least four times as large as at the present time.\u201d\nAn increase of conifers into a meadow is referred to as conifer encroachment. Within Yosemite Valley, incense-cedar and ponderosa pine are among the conifers that have been spreading into meadows. Conifer encroachment has taken hold also in the higher-elevation meadows with lodgepole pines. Scientists are trying to understand how widespread conifer encroachment is within Yosemite's 3,000 meadows and whether it is caused by a big-scale regional change, such as earlier annual snowmelt, more local and site specific disturbances, such as trampling, or natural plant succession from meadow to forest. Lodgepole pines, interestingly, appear to grow well in conditions that other conifers would find unfavorable such as inundated soils. For close to a century, the National Park Service has cleared young lodgepole pines in meadows to mitigate the perceived tree encroachment\u2014even placing CCC crews there in the 1930s to do the job.\nWhile Yosemite's high-elevation meadows have a low incidence of non-native plants, research strongly suggests they are no way immune to invasion. Lower-elevation meadows, for instance, have been invaded by velvet grass, oxeye daisy and bull thistle. Nitrogen pollution from atmospheric deposition has the potential to affect productivity and species composition of wetland vegetation, and, depending on seasonal timing, may affect aquatic organisms such as algae, microbes, invertebrates, and amphibians. Impacts on the primary producers of the aquatic food chain have the potential to significantly alter all wetland biota.\nRaising the Restoration Question\nAny meadow restoration effort must involve restoring the hydrologic processes that allow for a shallow water table throughout the summer. Scientists have restored the Happy Isles fen, which had a parking lot placed over a portion in 1928. In the 1980s, the pavement was removed, and, in 1993, more work included \"decompaction\" of the soil, removal of non-native species and planting of native species, such as Carex amplifolia and Scirpus microcarpus, to restore the original hydrologic regime and conserve the biological integrity of the Happy Isles plant community. Climatic change may be a threat to late-season water supply as it has the potential to affect groundwater levels and vegetation across Yosemite's meadow. The effects of earlier snowmelt, earlier drying out of ephemeral streams, and lower groundwater levels on meadow ecosystems should be studied.\nSo, What Can You Do? It's important to protect the meadows before they are impacted. One person or animal crossing a meadow is insignificant, but 100 people or 1,000 people can cause stress\u2014resulting in a lasting change. Stay on designated trails because social trails, often found in El Cap Meadow and Tuolumne Meadows, can result in the \"closure\" of a meadow in order to restore the damage done. High-elevation meadow vegetation can be very slow to recover from trampling disturbance. Repeated trampling kills plants, cuts the sod to expose soil below the rooting zone soil, and increases erosion. Too much soil compaction can also reduce the ability of meadow soils to hold the shallow watertable that is vital for the health of meadow vegetation. Wherever you go in Yosemite, tread lightly and avoid decorating nature's meadows with footprints and tire tracks.\n\"Now that the annual May floods have transformed a large part of the meadows into a clear calm lake, we understand what at first seemed an inexplicable mystery\u2014namely, why a raised wooden pathway has been built right across the meadows, between the two hotels. If the waters go on rising, it will soon be a necessary bridge.\" \u2013 Valley resident F. Gordon Cummings in 1884"

      "text": "Against all odds, bear mom and cubs find home in Santa Monica Mountains. \u2018Really incredible\u2019\n- Share via\n- The 5- to 7-year-old black bear known as Yellow 2291 was recently spotted by Topanga residents with three cubs.\n- The quartet would be the first black bear family to reside in the Santa Monica Mountains in years.\nThe travel pattern resembled a Southern California hiker\u2019s dream.\nThe journey began in Angeles National Forest above Glendora in May 2024 and progressed south into Azusa. There were stops, stays and starts from Monrovia and Sierra Madre, then northeast into La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, Tujunga and, eventually, the Santa Clarita Valley.\nThe route then turned southward into the Santa Susana Mountains, Simi Hills and then the Santa Monica Mountains before a couple of beach days and a return trip home.\nBut this trek \u2014 at least 100 miles \u2014 wasn\u2019t some bucket list excursion or \u201conly in L.A.\u201d Instagram story. It was completed not by a hiker, but a roughly 175-pound female black bear known as Yellow 2291.\nThe 5- to 7-year-old with a penchant for media coverage was recently spotted by Topanga residents with three cubs, making the quartet the first black bear family to reside in the Santa Monica Mountains in years.\nWhether the arrival of her cubs will stanch the bear\u2019s wanderlust is anyone\u2019s guess. But nearby residents have expressed questions \u2014 and concerns \u2014 at their unfamiliar ursine neighbors.\n\u201cOccasionally a bear ends up in someone\u2019s backyard, a pool, up in a tree, but very [rarely] in the Santa Monica Mountains,\u201d Jeff Sikich, a wildlife biologist with the National Park Service, said at a Topanga Town Council meeting earlier this week.\nData from roaming bears like Yellow 2291 could help conservationists build better wildlife crossings through Southern California.\nThe bear is known by two designations: Yellow 2291, due to a tracking tag applied to her by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife; and BB-14, used by the National Park Service to indicate that she\u2019s the 14th black bear the agency has captured, tracked or collared since 2005.\nMost previous bears were located in the Santa Susana Mountains as the park service trapped them while studying mountain lions.\nWhat makes Yellow 2291 remarkable is her extensive wandering, according to Jessica West, a human-wildlife conflict specialist with the Department of Fish and Wildlife.\nThe bear initially gained attention when she wandered into a trap in Claremont on May 31, 2024.\nAt the time, wildlife officials estimated she was between 3 and 5 years old and weighed 175 pounds.\nShe was given an ear tag and a GPS collar, West said, and moved into Angeles National Forest.\nThat\u2019s when her prolific journey began.\nBy June 2024, she had been documented traveling along the 210 Freeway corridor and crossing four major highways between the Santa Susana Mountains, Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains.\nA rare sighting of a black bear in the San Fernando Valley occurred last week. Officials say it\u2019s likely the same female spotted this summer in Chatsworth.\nShe was spotted at Cheeseboro Canyon Park outside Agoura Hills before crossing major highways again and finding herself stuck in a tree in Chatsworth in July 2024.\n\u201cFor whatever reason, she took a wrong turn, it seemed like, and ended up in very urban Chatsworth where she had no immediate access route back to her habitat,\u201d West said.\nWildlife officials again placed her back into Angeles National Forest, where West believes she likely met her mate.\nWest said Fish and Wildlife was unaware of any male black bears in the Santa Monica Mountains.\nBetween August and September, the bear was spotted in Sylmar before returning to the Santa Susana Mountains and eventually traipsing into Malibu, where she was captured on Pepperdine University campus security footage.\nShe returned to an area near Topanga Canyon, where she denned for months, beginning in October.\nIn January, she birthed three cubs \u2014 two male and one female.\nA bear linked to a spate of home break-ins in Sierra Madre in June was euthanized amid what city officials say is an uptick in conflict with the hulking animals.\nSince about April, she and the cubs have been spotted wandering around the Topanga area by residents.\nWest classified Yellow 2291\u2019s travels as \u201cextensive movement,\u201d but said the department does not know why she\u2019s traveled so much.\nSikich, the wildlife biologist, noted another bear with a large travel range: BB-12, a 4-year-old male who roamed 138 square miles over three months in 2023 before being struck and killed by a vehicle on the 101 Freeway.\nHe said BB-14 has traveled 47 square miles through seven months in the Santa Monica Mountains alone.\n\u201cWe were not expecting to see this when we captured this non-target bear in Claremont,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s been really incredible to see this range of movement, especially for a female bear.\u201d"

      "text": "Intimidated by hardbody hikers? Try these challenging (and fun) urban stair walks\n- Share via\nEditor\u2019s note: The Wild is all about featuring a variety of exciting voices from SoCal\u2019s outdoors scene. We loved having veteran journalist Dakota Kim share her explorations and escapades with us. For the next several weeks, we\u2019re featuring a series of guest writers (whom we\u2019ve dubbed \u201cwilders\u201d ) from around The Times who are eager to share their adventures with you. Our first wilder (and the author of last week\u2019s installment) is Times staff writer and flora-loving SoCal native Jeanette Marantos, who spends much of her outdoor time working in her garden, exploring L.A.\u2019s many neighborhood stair walks and strolling botanic gardens.\nBefore we go any further, there\u2019s something you need to know:\nI am not a hardbody.\nNot even a little bit. My \u201cworkouts\u201d consist of wrestling big bags of potting soil out of my car, shoveling compost out of my pickup and yanking my midsize dogs down the street. (I say \u201cyanking\u201d since \u201cwalking\u201d implies regular forward motion \u2014 their style is more a series of lateral stops and starts to roll, sniff and occasionally drop their own pungent offerings, which, yes, I always stop to pick up).\nI tell you this because it feels a bit intimidating writing installments of The Wild. The creator of this newsletter, Mary Forgione, has climbed Mt. Whitney more than 20 times, for pity\u2019s sake, and seems to have intimate knowledge of every trail in Southern California.\nI, on the other hand, have climbed no mountains, and my knowledge of hiking venues is skimpy at best. In fact, there was a period a few years ago when my knee swelled so badly and painfully that I despaired of ever walking to the kitchen again, let alone climbing trails. So I worried that writing for The Wild might be seen as a kind of fraud if people ever discovered my couch-potato leanings.\nAnd then I remembered \u2014 although I haven\u2019t climbed a mountain, I have mastered L.A.\u2019s toughest stairs. Not just one, but 16 such walks, involving hundreds of steep, chest-heaving, eye-dazzling steps through some of the city\u2019s oldest and most interesting neighborhoods.\nWould they have been easier if I\u2019d been in better shape? Yes. But I did them, and despite reaching a near-liquid, oxygen-deprived state on a couple of the hottest treks, I recall them all now with hazy pleasure (very similar to how those painful memories of giving birth dissipate with your precious babe in your arms).\nNo, seriously, these walks are great. If you\u2019re interested, read my story, which provides step-by-step descriptions and directions you can read on your phone (and awesome drone footage of the stairs by Times photographer Myung J. Chun). But I really recommend buying the inspiration for these walks: the 2010 book by former Times staffer Charles Fleming, \u201cSecret Stairs: A Walking Guide to the Historic Staircases of Los Angeles.\u201d\nFleming documents 42 looping stair walks around L.A., from the up-and-down neighborhood of El Sereno to ocean breeze-buffeted Pacific Palisades, and ranked them according to difficulty. He also writes beautifully and adds lots of historical tidbits about the neighborhoods, making this a fun read even for armchair wanderers.\nMy story covers only the 16 most difficult walks, completed last summer and fall. I did some alone but most were with friends, which I strongly recommend, because, you know, misery (and wonder) loves company.\nOne of the most memorable was the Cove/Loma Vista Loop Walk in Silver Lake, only 2 miles in distance but involving more than 650 steps, mostly going up, and a nearly vertical downhill walk on one of the city\u2019s steepest streets \u2014 Edendale Place.\nLoma Vista, it turns out, is a stair street, with houses accessible only by foot. I was so astonished by this realization \u2014 and the leafy, charmingly mysterious homes along the way \u2014 that I barely felt my heart hammering as I climbed. At the end, I was literally dripping with sweat as I slogged back to my car, hoping I wouldn\u2019t dissolve into a puddle before reaching air conditioning.\nLuckily, I had to pass Silverlake Wine to reach my car, and someone opened the door just as I walked by. Tendrils of cool called my name, so I threw shame to the wind and slunk in, hoping no one would notice my odiferous, watery state. I wandered the store in a stupor, basking in the conditioned air, until I spotted a bottle of orange wine called Gulp Hablo. It was organic, from Spain, and it glowed at me like a friendly beacon.\nSurely, this was the wine of champions, and I was now a champion, having completed this stupendous walk. So I bought an icy bottle, carefully drove it home, and later that night, savored it the way all champions do, with a few ibuprofen and my feet up on the couch.\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make is this: You don\u2019t have to be a hardbody to get outdoors. If you aren\u2019t ready for a mountain trail, check out our urban stair walks. You can use them as an excuse to explore downtown L.A. or the purported Nazi ruins at Murphy Ranch, the elegant manses in the Hollywood Hills, the rickety wooden stairs in Highland Park at the end of L.A.\u2019s purportedly steepest driveable street, or the unofficial outdoor gym of many Santa Monica hardbodies on the 4th Street Steps.\nI say be inspired by those hardbodies, and, when necessary, get out of their way (particularly good advice for the 4th Street Steps on the Santa Monica Canyon-Rustic Canyon Loop walk) but don\u2019t let them embarrass you into staying inside.\nBecause life is too short, my friends, and even the urban outdoors is full of wonders \u2014 one staircase at a time.\n3 things to do\n(First a note: Last week, The Wild mentioned professional falconer Adam Baz\u2019s Intro to Falconry class on Sept. 17 and it apparently struck a chord because the $100 class sold out immediately. So Baz, of Hawks on Hand, is now offering a second class from 9 to 11 a.m. Oct. 22 at Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in the Montecito Heights neighborhood. If you\u2019re interested in this close-up look at birds of prey, you\u2019d better act fast. )\n1. Pitch in on Monarch Nature Trail Volunteer Day, Sept. 2. This is a big win-win for people who want to enjoy a beautiful nature trail in Huntington Beach while learning about and helping to improve the monarch butterfly habitat by weeding, mulching, collecting seeds and watering young native plants.\nThis is a the more, the merrier-type of event that doesn\u2019t require pre-registration. It\u2019s sponsored by the UCCE Master Gardeners of Orange County from 9 to 11 a.m., and there are tasks for people of all ages, including activities for children. So bring the kids, plenty of drinking water and be sure everyone is wearing closed-toe shoes and sun protection (as in sunscreen and hats). Note: There are no restrooms available on site.\n2. Sign up for a community climate action day, which is returning to cities throughout the state this fall. This annual project is promoted by California Volunteers and the California Climate Action Corps, an AmeriCorps program that pays \u201cfellows\u201d 18 and older a stipend for 11 months to work on community projects that improve the environment. (Applications to join the fellowship are available now).\nIt\u2019s up to local communities to set a date and project for community climate action days. Los Angeles\u2019 project isn\u2019t coming until Nov. 11, but Riverside, in partnership with TreePeople and Assemblymember Sabrina Cervantes, is looking for volunteers on Sept. 23, from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., to help establish a native plant habitat at Martha McLean-Anza Narrows Park. The work will involve removal of invasive species, planting native species and trees and cleaning up along the Santa Ana River, which borders the northwestern edge of the park. Volunteers will get a free lunch. For other opportunities this fall, keep checking the California Climate Action Days website.\n3. Take a walk on the wild side at the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing. The crossing, which will span the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, is under construction and not scheduled for completion until late 2025, but the Cougar Conservancy\u2019s free guided tours on its southern and northern sides are in big demand. There are only a few slots left, so book sooner rather than later.\nIf you\u2019re wondering how a cast of hundreds, including scientists, landscape architects, native plant experts, soil scientists, water experts, biologists and engineers are working together to create a convincing corridor for wildlife over one of California\u2019s busiest freeways, this is your chance to learn more. The project is fascinating and well worth the visit.\nThe must-read\nTimes staff writer Laura Newberry really emphasizes my point about getting outside with her useful list of L.A. trails that are accessible to everyone, from wheelchair users to kids in strollers.\nThe thing is, most walkers don\u2019t realize how hard it can be for people on wheels to navigate trails, even when the paths seem flat and friendly.\nI will never forget watching a determined mother push a two-baby stroller up a steep, rocky path at the Ventura Botanical Gardens, with two large, on-leash dogs tethered to one arm and a huge backpack dangling from her other shoulder. I had to admire her tenacity, but that grueling walk couldn\u2019t have been much fun.\nThere was a time too when I pushed my father in a wheelchair down the pedestrian trail along Riverside\u2019s beautiful and historic Victoria Avenue. I wanted to give him a fresh perspective, broader and less arduous than our hilly neighborhood, but I soon realized that the path was not meant for people sitting in rolling chairs.\nThe first challenge was finding a place to park so we could safely get my father into the chair. The second issue was pushing him along a narrow hard-pack stretch of dirt to get him on the trail, which took some uncomfortable maneuvering. Once we finally made it to the trail, I kept hitting bits of gravel and small debris that caused his chair to bump and shake. I wouldn\u2019t have noticed them as a walker, but I could tell from his gritted teeth every time I dodged fallen palm fronds and small holes in the trail that he was having a less than wonderful time.\nI was trying to decide what to do when I suddenly heard a thundering thump behind me as a giant palm frond dropped a few feet from where we\u2019d just been. Luckily, my father\u2019s hearing wasn\u2019t so great, so he didn\u2019t realize our near miss, but at that point, I felt the best course was to turn around and go get ice cream, to which he happily agreed.\nLaura\u2019s story lists eight truly accessible trails. It could have been at least 12, but four of the others that were recommended to her turned out to be too bumpy or steep or narrow to merit inclusion on the list.\nTrails that can be enjoyed by the widest range of abilities do have a few things in common, Newberry notes, using tips from Ed Price, founder of the Trail Access Project in Nevada.\n\u201cThey\u2019re either paved or made from firm ground that wheelchairs can traverse safely; they\u2019re at least three feet wide; and they have a low-grade, meaning they\u2019re relatively flat,\u201d Newberry writes. \u201cThey should also have accessible parking spots nearby. Resting areas and handrails are a plus.\u201d\nBottom line: We need more trails that are truly accessible to people who can\u2019t move without wheels, \u201cbecause everyone should be able to enjoy the outdoors,\u201d Newberry writes.\nIf you have a favorite accessible trail not listed in that story, let us know so we can share the wealth in a future updated guide. Email your suggestions to laura.newberry@latimes.com with the subject line: Accessible trail suggestion.\nHappy adventuring,\nP.S.\nWriting this week\u2019s column really stirred some fond memories of two of my favorite stair walks in the Hollywood Hills: the Hollywood Bowl and High Tower Loop and the Beachwood Canyon Walk.\nSo I was pretty finely tuned to Hollywood vibes when I ran across this lovely opinion piece written by Linda Deutsch, a longtime special correspondent for the Associated Press and a resident of the Hollywood Hills: \u201cA Serendipitous Encounter That Could Only Happen in Hollywood.\u201d\nIn it, she tells the story of a chance encounter with a lovely young Ukrainian woman who was walking up her street, looking for the Hollywood sign before she left for her new temporary home in Spokane, Wash. The woman was a medical student, nearly done with her studies, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced her to leave. She was no dewy-eyed starlet wannabe, but she still wanted to see the place that once felt like a fairy tale.\nThe story Deutsch tells unfolds like a beautiful script, both heartbreaking and inspiring. When the young woman named Maria finally sees the Hollywood sign, she gasped, Deutsch writes. \u201cThen she said something I will always remember. \u2018People here may think these are just letters on a hill. But to us, this is our dream.\u2019\u201d\nIf you have time for nothing else today, take a moment to read this short but beautifully crafted tale. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it, or my envy for how Deutsch deftly adds a pointed message to the industry at the very end.\nI don\u2019t want to give anything away, but the woman can write, I tell you, and I\u2019m the better for having read her words.\nOh, and if you have your own visitors dying to see something more of Hollywood than the boulevard, take them on one or both of the Hollywood Hills stair walks above. I guarantee it will win you star host status.\nFor more insider tips on Southern California\u2019s beaches, trails and parks, check out past editions of The Wild.

      "text": "|\nOver eons, rivers and glaciers somehow carved 3,000 feet into solid granite to create Yosemite Valley. The nuances of the Valley form spectacular rock formations, for which Yosemite Valley is famous. Visitors all year can gaze up from the Valley floor to appreciate the enormity of it all. During summer (or for those willing to do an overnight ski trip in winter), the view from Glacier Point provides a perspective from above. Half Dome is perhaps the most recognized symbol of Yosemite. Rising nearly 5,000 feet above the Valley floor, it is one of the most sought-after landmarks in Yosemite. Some people even hike or rock-climb to the top! You can see Half Dome throughout much of eastern Yosemite Valley, including on the road between Yosemite Village and Yosemite Valley Lodge and roads near Curry Village. Mirror Lake, while not really a lake, is a popular place to see Half Dome from up close. It's a two-mile round-trip walk on a paved trail with a 6.6% to 10.6% grade. (Cars displaying an accessibility placard can drive to near Mirror Lake; see the park's accessibility guide for details.)\nEl Capitan, rising over 3,000 feet above the floor of Yosemite Valley, is a favorite for experienced rock climbers. El Capitan is opposite Bridalveil Fall and is best seen from the roads in western Yosemite Valley, including Tunnel View, Bridalveil Fall area, and El Capitan Meadow.\nCathedral Rocks and Spires form the eastern side of the canyon through which Bridalveil Creek flows. Some people think these rocks, just opposite of El Capitan, are even more impressive than El Capitan! You can see these formations from the turnout at El Capitan Meadow. The Three Brothers are located just east of El Capitan. It is made up of Eagle Peak (the uppermost \"brother\"), and Middle and Lower Brothers. You can see the Three Brothers from Southside Drive or the Merced River just east of Cathedral Beach Picnic Area. Sentinel Rock, like a sentry, overlooks Yosemite Valley, along the opposite side of the Valley From Yosemite Falls. You can see Sentinel Rock from the road near Lower Yosemite Fall or by walking on the wheelchair accessible trails in nearby Cook's Meadow. Glacier Point is most famous for the view you can see from it, but the Glacier Point cliff itself is quite impressive. You can see Glacier Point while driving to The Ahwahnee or, more spectacularly, from Curry Village. |\nLast updated: November 8, 2024"

      "text": "Avoid calamity \u2014 or worse \u2014 on your next hike by remembering these five basic tips\n- Share via\nEditor\u2019s note: The Wild is all about featuring a variety of exciting voices from SoCal\u2019s outdoors scene. For the last several weeks, we\u2019ve featured a series of guest writers (whom we\u2019ve dubbed \u201cwilders\u201d ) from around The Times who are eager to share their adventures with you. This week\u2019s guest wilder is one of The Times\u2019 L.A. County government reporters, Jaclyn Cosgrove. On weekdays, Jaclyn can often be found observing a public meeting or investigating the mental health system. But when the weekend comes, they hit the trails with their trusty 11-year-old hiking companion, Maggie May (a dog who thinks she\u2019s a human), often in search of a trail no one else is on.\nI grew up in the country. As a kid, I had more dogs and goats to play with than neighborhood children. When friends came over to our ranch in rural Oklahoma, I would teach them how to jump from row to row on the round bales of hay in our pasture. My dad used to say that we didn\u2019t go camping because we were already in the woods.\nI learned country people skills, like wrapping a wound with whatever you had, whether it be a Band-Aid or duct tape and paper towels. We didn\u2019t have 911 service. So, when my dad ran himself over with a tractor \u2014 a story for another Wild \u2014 my mom hauled ass in our pickup truck to the nearest hospital, usually a 20-minute drive, to get him care. (He was fine.)\nI did not grow up hiking trails or building campfires. Those skills came later in life, when my mother and I started attending adult outdoor education events aimed at teaching us skills we\u2019d like to have, like kayaking, fly-fishing and archery. Our first time at Women in the Outdoors in Tenkiller State Park, we famously failed for hours to put up our tent, until it was late and dark. We were saved by the event hosts, who put up our tent for us in about three minutes. (We later took a class and learned our mistakes \u2014 and how to build a campfire.)\nWhen my wife and I moved from Oklahoma City to Los Angeles in 2017, I yearned to be in nature. I hadn\u2019t realized how important the woods were to me until I was without them. We lived in Koreatown, the most densely populated neighborhood in Los Angeles, where the only nearby green space was private land. I soon turned to the mountains. And oh, the mistakes this country kid made.\nThere was the time I was hiking in old running shoes in Fryman Canyon Park and looked down to peel a clementine. I felt my feet move in opposite directions along the sandy Southern California soil. I slipped, overextending my right hamstring. With no first aid kit, I was forced to MacGyver my dog\u2019s leash as a brace around my knee, and use the handle to lift my leg as I walked. That day I learned California dirt is not the same as Oklahoma dirt \u2014 and the importance of hiking boots.\nAnd then there was the time my dog, Maggie May, and I got overheated on Strawberry Peak. Out of water, I carried her off that mountain (yes, I still feel terrible, don\u2019t @ me). Or the time it was crisp and cool in Los Angeles, but because of an inversion layer, the temperature on Mt. Wilson was hotter than below, and we got overheated again. That time, I had a special backpack to carry her, and stopped much sooner.\nOver the last six years of living in Los Angeles, I have learned valuable lessons about how to stay safe on day hikes, whether I\u2019m solo hiking or with friends.\nPart of my learning has come from Googling. One of the first things that pops up when you research outdoor and hiking preparedness are articles like this one from outdoor-supply company REI explaining the need for the \u201c10 essentials\u201d: navigation, a headlamp, sun protection, first aid, a knife, fire, shelter, extra food, extra water and extra clothes.\nBut as Jessie Krebs, a former U.S. Air Force SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) specialist told me in a recent interview, the 10 essentials is an imperfect concept.\nFor one, that list doesn\u2019t include carrying anything for signaling, which helps rescuers find you, Krebs said. In survival, your number one priority is \u201c[to] get out of there,\u201d Krebs said. Even so, many 10-essentials lists treat signaling as an afterthought, she said.\nIn her courses, Krebs instead teaches the five basic needs for survival, which once learned, can be used to plan what you need to take with you on a day hike.\nNo. 1: Signaling options. \u201cAs soon as you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s a survival situation, signaling is your number one priority,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cYou want to help search and rescue find you.\u201d\nMany people don\u2019t realize how hard it is for the search and rescue folks to see us from their helicopters \u2014 especially if you\u2019re wearing green, black or any earth tones.\nDuring a recent rescue mission on Cucamonga Peak near Mt. Baldy, rescuers couldn\u2019t initially see a hiker in need \u2014 even though a fellow hiker had used his Garmin inReach that told rescuers where to come \u2014 until that hiker used his bright orange beanie to signal them.\nKrebs points to the three types of signaling: electronic signals, like a satellite communicator; ground to air signals, like signal mirrors or lights (even your cellphone camera can help); and pyrotechnic signals, which are admittedly tricky in Southern California, where lighting a fire can create a worse disaster than being lost.\nKrebs teaches the other four basic needs, via a series of clever rhymes to help students remember.\nNo. 2 / Take care of you. Your second basic need is personal protection, Krebs said, explaining that, in a survival scenario, you have to ensure you can stay thermally regulated, whether that\u2019s not getting too hot or too cold.\nIf you\u2019re getting too hot and you have plenty of water, you can take your shirt or hat off, and soak those. If you\u2019re hiking with your canine companion, you can cup water in your hand and soak their fur. In a cold scenario, if you bring a rain jacket that\u2019s a size up from what you need, you can create an insulated puffy jacket by stuffing it with items from your pack or organic material \u2014 like dry leaves \u2014 and it will keep you warmer until rescue arrives.\nOverall, you need to make sure you have the right clothing, equipment and means to make a shelter and a fire in case you end up having to stay overnight on a hike, waiting for rescue.\nNo. 3 / Go pee. This is a reminder to drink water. In a survival scenario, food is less important, Krebs said, unless a person has diabetes or another medical condition that requires food. Otherwise, humans can go at least 30 days without food. For a survival scenario, \u201cif you\u2019re not going pee, drink some water,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have water, go find it. If you don\u2019t have any way to disinfect it, drink it anyway.\u201d (But don\u2019t drink your own pee.)\nNo. 4 / Explore. Have what you need to navigate the terrain, such as a paper map and compass, and also know what risks you might face in your environment, like snakes, landslides, avalanches and weather. Plan ahead for those.\nNo. 5 / Stay alive. This relates to everything you need to maintain your health, especially your mental and emotional health. It\u2019s knowing how to calm yourself down so you don\u2019t waste energy panicking. It\u2019s making sure you can maintain your hygiene if stuck outside longer than you planned.\n\u201cGo through that list,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cWhat do I have for signaling? What do I have for everything (needed for) personal protection \u2014 clothing, equipment, shelter and fire? What do I have for water? Am I taking some kind of water container? How much water is going to be out there? What do I have for backup, for disinfection? For No. 4, what do I have for all my navigational needs? What do I need in this particular environment? And five, what are the essential medications that if I don\u2019t make it back tonight, I should have with me? And do I need a first aid kit, and if so, what do I need in it, based on the terrain, conditions and people going out?\u201d\nEven though Krebs\u2019 five-basic-needs list might sound daunting at first, I find it extremely helpful and comforting. Based on that advice, what I bring with me to hike Griffith Park versus Mt. Baldy will be pretty different. When I\u2019m hiking in the Icehouse Canyon area, near Mt. Baldy, I always bring my rain jacket because I know it is almost always windy at Icehouse Canyon Saddle where several trailheads meet and it\u2019s fairly exposed to wind. To hike Griffith Park, instead of that jacket, I usually just pack my emergency blanket because it\u2019s lightweight and multipurpose, (serving as a shade, a blanket to lie down on if hurt and as a signaling device since it\u2019s big and orange).\nLastly, I\u2019d like to address a type of safety that\u2019s important not to overlook \u2014 your safety as it relates to who you are.\nAs a nonbinary hiker, there are times when I feel anxious about going out on the trail. What if I run into someone who hates trans people, and they say something? What if I\u2019m hiking shirtless, and someone notices I\u2019ve had top surgery and reacts? Luckily, I\u2019ve never had any issues \u2014 but it\u2019s still on my mind.\nIn recent years, more attention has been paid in the outdoors community to the experiences of hikers of color, who come to the trails with their own anxieties.\nKriste Peoples, executive director of Women\u2019s Wilderness, said as a Black woman, she hadn\u2019t felt a real sense of belonging in the outdoors until she co-founded Trailblazers, a BIPOC women\u2019s and nonbinary group within Women\u2019s Wilderness.\nPeoples got into hiking and trail running because she didn\u2019t feel seen or embraced in Boulder, Colo., where she lived at the time.\n\u201cAnd so, I was like, \u2018The mountains aren\u2019t judging me, the mountains don\u2019t care what I have relative to gear and prowess. The mountains are welcoming me, just as I am,\u2019\u201d Peoples told The Times. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I got into it.\u201d\nThrough running Trailblazers, she has heard from other women and nonbinary people of color who shared their experiences hiking and how they hadn\u2019t felt welcome or seen in other spaces.\nIt can be dangerous for a person of color hiking with a group when they\u2019re the only person of color, and they don\u2019t feel seen or heard, or they\u2019re experiencing microaggressions that go unaddressed, Peoples said.\n\u201cBecause if I feel like I have to be on guard because I\u2019m the only one, and I wasn\u2019t sure about this anyway, I\u2019m more prone to not pay as close attention, or to not feel as engaged with the group, I might fall back a bit, I might expose myself to more risks than I would because I don\u2019t feel safe in the group,\u201d Peoples said. \u201cI might not tell people if I\u2019m under-resourced, if I don\u2019t have enough water, because then \u2018Oh, then they\u2019re going to judge me.\u2019\u201d\nI hope this newsletter empowers you to prepare for your next hike, feeling confident you\u2019ve considered how to best protect yourself and those with you, whether they be canine or human.\n3 things to do\n1. Go where no man has gone before, kinda. On Oct. 29, you can walk, bike, skip, hop, jump or do anything else you want on a stretch of car-free roadway for the first time in 20 years. 626 Golden Streets ArroyoFest will shut down seven miles of the Arroyo Seco Parkway portion of the 110 Freeway from 7 to 11 a.m. The southbound lanes will be reserved for pedestrians, including walkers, runners and wheelchair users, while the northbound lanes will be for using wheeled devices, like bikes and skateboards. The event is free, but you\u2019re encouraged to bring a few bucks to support local businesses along the way. 626goldenstreets.com\n2. Smash your pumpkins. If your Halloween pumpkins survive the squirrels, you can dispose of them at LA Compost\u2019s Annual Pumpkin Smash. The event runs Nov. 3, 4 and 5 and includes three locations where you\u2019ll be provided tools to smash your pumpkins into compostable bits. Additional information and a link to register at lacompost.org.\n3. Reflect, dialogue and celebrate. \u201cThe Iridescence of Knowing\u2019\u2019 invites visitors to Oxy Arts in Eagle Rock to learn about the rich lineage of Indigenous cultural production in Tovaangar, known today as the greater Los Angeles basin. In the exhibition, you\u2019ll see works from many First Peoples communities of Southern California. Runs through Nov. 18. More information at oxyarts.oxy.edu.\nThe must-read\nMy must-read is actually a must-listen. I am an aspiring podcast aficionado, listening to any sci-fi or dystopian podcast I can get my ears on.\nOne of my favorite recent listens was \u201cForest 404,\u201d a BBC Radio 4 sci-fi thriller set in a 24th century world where forests have been erased from history. Regardless of whether you listen to the entire podcast, I highly recommend you take time to listen to episode T9, titled \u201cLove Letter to the Forest,\u201d a poem of sorts by writer David Haskell.\n\u201cWe breathe each other, every inhale brings life\u2019s catalyst, oxygen, half of this precious gas is made deep inside your emerald leaves, the other half of the oxygen in my breath, comes from your comrades, the ocean algae.\u201d\nIn practicing gratitude for the forest, may it lead us all to want to protect it even more.\nStay safe out there,\nP.S.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an interesting way to spend time outdoors while volunteering, check out nonprofit TreePeople\u2019s calendar, where you can sign up to help restore habitats harmed by wildfire or plant trees to help cool down neighborhoods. treepeople.org\nFor more insider tips on Southern California\u2019s beaches, trails and parks, check out past editions of The Wild.

      "text": "An official website of the United States government\nHere's how you know\nOfficial websites use .gov A\n.gov website belongs to an official government\norganization in the United States.\nSecure .gov websites use HTTPS A\nlock (\n) or https:// means you've safely connected to\nthe .gov website. Share sensitive information only on official,\nsecure websites.\nThere are three first-come, first-served campgrounds available in in late fall, winter, and early spring. These often fill, especially on weekends and holidays. First-come, first-served camping is not available from late May through October. However, some campgrounds listed below have reservations available two weeks in advance from around July to mid-October.\nCampfires and Wood Smoke\nCampfires are allowed (in a fire ring and when attended), except they are only allowed from 5 pm to 10 pm in Yosemite Valley campgrounds and Hodgdon Meadow Campground. However, consider minimizing fire usage or not having a fire! Emissions from campfires can degrade air quality in and near campgrounds. This is especially true at night and in early morning, when inversions trap and concentrate fine particles from those campfires near the ground, creating local conditions that are potentially unhealthy for sensitive individuals.\nYosemite has 10 campgrounds that can accommodate RVs and trailers (including fifth wheels) of varying lengths. If you plan to spend the night in your RV, you must be in a designated standard or RV campsite\u2014you can't park in a parking lot, along the side of the road, or in a tent-only campsite.\nReservations: campgrounds requiring reservations are usually full from around April through September. You should make a reservation as early as possible. If you don't have reservations, find out more about camping without reservations.\nElectrical, water, and sewer hookups are not available in Yosemite, although dump stations (with fresh water) are available at Upper Pines Campground (all year), near Wawona Campground (summer only), and near Tuolumne Meadows Campground (closed until 2024, then summer only). Generator use is allowed, but only between 7 am and 9 am, noon and 2 pm, and 5 pm to 7 pm. Generator use is not allowed at other times.\nMaximum RV/trailer lengths: In Yosemite Valley, the maximum RV length is 40 feet and maximum trailer length is 35 feet, however, only a total of 8 sites of this size are available (six sites in Lower Pines and two in North Pines, which are open spring through fall). Many more sites exist in Yosemite Valley and elsewhere in Yosemite that can take RVs up to 35 feet or trailers up to 24 feet.\nRV length and trailer length are not the same! Please note that many campsites have different maximum lengths for RVs and trailers. This is because many of the campsites are back-in sites with limited turning radius. We do not enforce the length limits as long as the RV or trailer can fit on the parking pad in the site. However, if you reserve a site for equipment other than what you bring, and the site can't accommodate your RV or trailer, we will not be able to find a different campsite for you.\nFood storage: You may store food in hard-sided RVs and trailers, as long the food is out of sight, and windows, doors, and vents are closed when you're not in your campsite. Food may not be stored in pop-up or tent trailers, or other soft-sided campers.\nTap water and creek water: Campgrounds listed as having creek water have vault toilets (not regular restrooms). Campgrounds listed as having tap water have regular restrooms.\nShowers are available at the Curry Village pool showerhouse for a fee. Showers are not available elsewhere in the park.\nDump stations are available at Upper Pines Campground (all year), near Wawona Campground (summer only), and near Tuolumne Meadows Campground (summer only). No campsites in Yosemite have hook-ups of any kind.\nOnce Tioga Road opens, crews begin working in campgrounds and other facilities to prepare them for opening. Before campgrounds can open, crews assess the condition of the campgrounds, remove trees that may fall or have fallen, make emergency road repairs, de-winterize restrooms, pump vault toilets, and turn on and test water systems. Additionally, sewer and utility systems often need repair each spring.\nAll this work also has to happen at visitor centers, offices, residences, and other facilities, as well. Opening offices and residences for staff are a high priority because campgrounds and other facilities need staff in order to operate.\nAs a result, campgrounds usually don't begin opening until at least four weeks after the Tioga Road opens. The table below reflects the best available estimate for when campgrounds will open and is revised as soon as we have updates.\nWhite Wolf Campground is open with portable toilets. Drinking water is not available.\n(Closing dates refer to the day the campground closes; the night before that is the last night to camp.)\nBackcountry campgrounds at Little Yosemite Valley and near the High Sierra camps (Glen Aulin, May Lake, Sunrise, Merced Lake, and Vogelsang) are not part of the campground reservation system. A wilderness permit is required to stay at these campgrounds."

      "text": "Towering over 3,000 feet from its base to its tallest peak, El Capitan is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Yosemite Valley. This pale granite monolith has captured the imaginations of artists seeking to portray the awe this natural feature inspires.\nFormed by molten rock and polished by glaciers, Half Dome rises over 4,700 feet from the floor of Yosemite Valley. Since the first ascent in1875, determined mountaineers have sought to ascend this massive granite formation, while generations of artists have been moved to capture Half Dome\u2019s distinct profile.\nYosemite National Park is intercut by a number of water features, including the Merced and Tuolumne Rivers, Tenaya Creek, and Mirror Lake. Artists have drawn inspiration from these areas to capture scenes that range from solemn moonlit meditations to depictions of the thundering rush of water over rock.\nWhile much of its renown stems from its pristine landscapes, Yosemite\u2019s history is entwined with those of the people who have long lived in and visited the area. Artistic representations of people in Yosemite range from vivid depictions of Native American life to painted snapshots of campers and hikers, their expeditions frozen in time through the strokes of the brush.\nYosemite National Park lies within the Sierra Nevada mountain range of central California. The park\u2019s peaks and valleys host a multitude of scenic natural features that spark artistic expression. The verdant hues of alpine foliage and riots of color produced by sunlight glinting off sheer granite rock faces continue to provide limitless sources of inspiration.\nYosemite Valley was carved by glaciers over tens of millions of years, and is one of the most visited areas of the park. Artists have flocked to Yosemite Valley to depict stunning views of Half Dome and El Capitan, to Bridalveil and Yosemite Falls.\nCountless waterfalls pierce through Yosemite National Park\u2019s granite cliffs. From the descent of Bridalveil Falls that thunders in the spring to the precipitous drops of Yosemite Falls, the tallest waterfall in the United States, these waterfalls\u2019 majesty continue to inspire painters."

      "text": "- Share via\nJust five hours north of Los Angeles sits a national park that should be on your outdoor bucket list.\nIt features a valley carved millions of years ago by glaciers, hulking mountains made of granite and other rock, countless waterfalls, massive ancient trees and a cool, clear river.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat sounds like Yosemite.\u201d Even better. It\u2019s like Yosemite but way more chill.\nKings Canyon National Park will give you the majestic outdoors respite you\u2019re dreaming of without all the busy trails, swarming crowds and traffic jams at the park entrance gate that come with the Hollywood Boulevard of national parks. Just east of Fresno, this swath of paradise is the underrated local favorite, with welcoming campgrounds, easy-to-navigate day trails, plentiful backpacking opportunities and swimming holes galore.\nFor the record:\n9:53 a.m. Aug. 28, 2024A previous version of this story said Kings Canyon is west of Fresno. It is east.\nAs I was heading out to report this story, I steeled myself for the typical national park experience. As someone who once accidentally got into a spat with another grown adult at Yellowstone National Park while attempting to help my 5-year-old niece steal a peek at Old Faithful, I know all too well the way chaotic tourist crowds can get under my skin.\nBut those crowds never materialized. Kings Canyon gets a fraction of the foot traffic that Yosemite does. Last August, Yosemite saw almost 594,000 visitors, and Kings Canyon saw 81,000, according to federal data. At its busiest, in June of last year, Kings Canyon welcomed 126,000 visitors, which was just over a fourth of the visitors who went to Yosemite that month.\nYou might be wondering: Is Kings Canyon\u2019s landscape as spellbindingly majestic? The short answer is yes, if a tad more rugged. Both parks feature massive granite mountains, gorgeous rivers and alpine meadows. But Yosemite\u2019s natural wonders have the manicured sheen of a famous name. Kings Canyon is its untamed, serene cousin. When I asked a ranger the name of a nearby cliff, they quipped: \u201cWe don\u2019t name everything like Yosemite.\u201d During my three-day stay, I heard multiple guests say: \u201cThis is like a chill Yosemite.\u201d\nReservations are often booked up 6 months in advance at some of the most sought-after camping grounds. What\u2019s a procrastinator to do? Consider some of L.A.\u2019s best first-come, first-served sites.\nIn fairness, many of the best experiences you can have at Kings Canyon are in the backcountry and require some level of backpacking knowledge. But even if you\u2019re a camping novice, this guide outlines the many different ways you can experience the park, whether it\u2019s from a cozy lodge or a magnificent campground.\nThis guide focuses on the Cedar Grove area of the park. After being closed for more than a year because of major flooding, it reopened this summer. Its campgrounds are slowly but surely becoming available to book. (More on how to do that below.)\nPlease enjoy your stay in this slept-on paradise. And eat your heart out, Yosemite.\nGetting there | Where to stay | What to pack | Bear safety | Where to day hike | Other activities\nGetting there\nSequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks are two parks managed as one. Kings Canyon is the northern half of the parks. There are several entrances. The most direct way to reach the Cedar Grove area of Kings Canyon National Park from L.A. is to take Highway 180 near Fresno to the Big Stump entrance.\nFrom here, you\u2019ll follow this scenic seasonal roadway into Kings Canyon. It\u2019s a beautiful drive, especially the beginning that passes through Sequoia National Forest. There you\u2019ll be met with incredible vistas and waterfalls, including one you can take a short walk to visit. (More on that below.)\nThis route is not accessible year-round. Highway 180 from Grant Grove Village to Cedar Grove is open seasonally. It generally opens the fourth Friday in April and closes in mid-November. You can check the road conditions on the Kings Canyon website.\nIf you\u2019d like to take the scenic way to reach Kings Canyon, you can drive through Sequoia National Park via Highway 198. You\u2019ll pass through the idyllic town of Three Rivers before entering Sequoia National Park. A slow winding journey, you\u2019ll drive about 46 miles north until you reach the Highway 180 junction. There are several great places to stop along the way. Honorable mention goes to the General Sherman Tree, a giant sequoia that\u2019s one of the largest and oldest trees in the world.\nLos Angeles County is home to multiple freshwater lakes where you can swim, fish, kayak, bird and much more. Here are the best ones.\nIf you\u2019re craving more giant trees, this route offers multiple spots to see them, although it will add about two hours to your trip. You can also take the first route mentioned and stop at the Grant Grove area of Kings Canyon before you reach Cedar Grove, which doesn\u2019t feature sequoias like the rest of the parks.\nTake note that if you have the \u201cavoid tolls\u201d option selected on your mapping app, it might try to direct you to take an unpaved road to avoid paying the park entrance fee. In short: This is a bad idea. Also, beware that service is scant in these parts, so it\u2019s best to download the area on your GPS app before you leave. While I\u2019m ticking through lifesaving necessities, be sure to top off your gas tank in a nearby town before entering the park, since options are limited inside. At present, there are no electric car chargers in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Best to enter the park with a full charge.\nWhere to stay\nSentinel Campground\nReopened in July, Sentinel Campground is the only campground open in the Cedar Grove area of Kings Canyon as of late August. It offers 82 sites for tents, RVs and trailers that you can reserve on recreation.gov. There are no first-come first-served sites in the campground.\nSentinel Campground\nThe South Fork of the Kings River runs along the northern side of the campground, near a handful of coveted (read: quickly booked) sites. But you don\u2019t have to be next to the river to enjoy yourself. No matter where you end up staking your tent, you will be treated to a dark sky full of twinkling stars, a concert of crickets, the calming sound of the nearby river rushing and the soothing whoosh of wind through the canyon. This is hopefully not all drowned out by the roar of your neighbor\u2019s RV generator. Quiet hours are at 10 p.m. after all.\nSteller\u2019s jays and robins may appear when you start cooking your dinner, optimistic for a treat. Hopefully you aren\u2019t greeted by one of the park\u2019s larger hungrier residents, the black bear. Throughout the campground, there are flush toilets, sinks to wash dishes and spigots with drinking water. Each site has a campfire ring, picnic table and bear-proof food storage box.\nDuring the day, when you aren\u2019t out adventuring, you can find a shady spot beneath a towering ponderosa pine or cedar tree. Some might even be small enough to hang a hammock.\nThe Cedar Grove Lodge\nLocation, location, location! The Cedar Grove Lodge is a rustic but charming throwback to simpler times. The Wi-Fi is iffy at best, and there aren\u2019t televisions in the rooms. But you aren\u2019t coming here to hang out in your room. The lodge is close to all the area\u2019s main attractions. It\u2019s situated next to the Kings River, where guests pull up a lawn chair and enjoy the serenity of the space. It offers standard and suite rooms with queen and king beds and a complimentary breakfast.\nCedar Grove Lodge\nIt also has a gift shop (with fairly priced souvenirs), a market and the Cedar Grove Diner, a counter-service snack bar, on its first floor. From 4 to 8 p.m., the diner serves burgers, sandwiches and wraps. The menu includes beef, chicken and fish offerings as well as a plant-based veggie burger and hummus wrap. But sorry, no fries.\nMeanwhile, its market is a good resource in case you forgot to pack something. It sells tent stakes and chairs as well as food and ice.\nThe most luxurious part of the Cedar Grove Village area is the showers, available to anyone in the park. The lodge\u2019s market sells shower tokens for $1.50 for three minutes. (You can use multiple tokens to extend your hygienic routine, but make sure to allow each token\u2019s time to run out before inserting the next. Otherwise, it\u2019s a wasted token.)\nFrom TikTok-famous nieces to birding besties, this list will help you choose the right L.A. hike for just about every type of visitor.\nOther options\nOutside Kings Canyon, nearby campgrounds include:\n- Convict Flat Campground, a first-come first-served spot with five campsites in Sequoia National Forest. It\u2019s free to use with the entry fee you pay to get into the park. Light on amenities, it has a vault toilet and no potable water. It\u2019s about 11 miles from the Cedar Grove area of Kings Canyon.\n- Princess Campground, an 88-site reservation-only site in Sequoia National Forest featuring giant sequoia stumps, a sequoia grove and a meadow with wildflowers. Amenities include drinking water, vault toilets and an amphitheater. It\u2019s about 23 miles from the Cedar Grove area of Kings Canyon.\n- Sunset Campground, a 158-site reservation-only campground in Sequoia National Forest, three miles from the Kings Canyon entrance. It boasts beautiful trees, cellphone reception, flush toilets and a camp store that sells ice, firewood and other necessities. It\u2019s about 30 miles from the Cedar Grove area of Kings Canyon.\nWhat to pack\nIf camping, you\u2019ll want to pack the usuals, including a tent, sleeping bags, an air mattress or other cushioning, extra blankets and pillows. Remember to pack a few light sources. I always like to have both a headlamp and a few solar-powered lanterns. And, just because I\u2019ve forgotten each of these items on various trips, I will remind you: Don\u2019t forget to bring a mallet for your tent stakes, your camping chairs and a shovel to dig out the campfire pit.\nYou will not have cellphone reception in the Cedar Grove area. For safety reasons, you should share your trip itinerary with a family member or friend, along with an estimated time of when you\u2019ll be back. There is a pay phone at the Cedar Grove Lodge. For the zoomers reading, that\u2019s a coin-operated phone you can use to make calls. Maybe put a roll of quarters in your car, just in case.\nBear safety\nKings Canyon is home to American black bears. Throughout the park, you\u2019ll find signs reminding you to be \u201cbear aware.\u201d That includes ensuring that all food, beverages and scented items (like shampoo, toothpaste and lip balm) are stowed in a bear box when you aren\u2019t using them. This applies to not only campgrounds but also trails. At trailheads, you will find bear-proof brown vaults where you should stow any snacks and scented items you aren\u2019t taking on the hike. (I left half a bar of chocolate in one, and no one stole it. The honor system is alive and well in this park!)\nThe park advises that, if you see a bear, clap your hands and in a loud, firm voice yell: \u201cGet out of here, bear!\u201d You should report all bear sightings to a ranger. Leave the bear spray at home, though. Bear spray is illegal in national parks where only black bears are present.\nWhere to day hike\nThe Kings Canyon Cedar Grove area has plenty of day hikes to choose from, all of which you can hike without a permit. Wilderness permits are required only for overnight trips. Here\u2019s a three-day itinerary of the best spots to go to if you\u2019re visiting for a quick weekend.\nRoaring River Falls to Zumwalt Meadows\nDay 1: After setting up your tent, hit the trails for an introductory stroll at the Roaring River Falls parking area. This short paved path leads you to a nice-sized waterfall noisy enough that you\u2019ll know how it earned its name. This is a nice spot to unwind and have a picnic. (Though swimming is not advised. Drowning is the most common way people die in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.)\nOnce you\u2019re done at the waterfall, you can take the nearby dirt path about two miles to the backside of Zumwalt Meadows. Flooding in 2019 washed out its boardwalk, so this is no longer a loop trail. That said, it\u2019s a pleasant walk between the canyon walls where you can appreciate your first taste of beauty before embarking on bigger adventures tomorrow. Plus, there are a few sandy spots where the current is manageable. Life jackets are advisable for younger kiddos or anyone who cannot swim.\nMist Falls trail\nDay 2: This is when you\u2019ll want to do your longest hike. For that I\u2019d recommend heading to the Road\u2019s End parking area to tackle the Mist Falls trail, an eight-mile out-and-back trail that will lead you through forest and wetlands, over boulders and up to a massive, humbling cascade of water. The last mile is where you gain the most elevation, so make sure you\u2019re hydrated and sated with a power snack for that final push. After completing the trail, head over to Muir Rock for a swim. Be mindful of the current.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for ocean views or desert landscapes or soaring mountain peaks, Los Angeles offers miles upon miles of strikingly different trails.\nHotel Creek trail\nDay 3: Do you have one more hike in you? Great! This last one is a treat, especially as the sun rises. Head to the Hotel Creek trailhead, located about a half-mile north of the Cedar Grove Lodge. You have two main options here. You can hike 4.4 miles out and back to the Cedar Grove overlook, where you will find panoramic views of the whole park. Or you can do a 7.3-mile loop of Hotel and Lewis Creek. From the overlook, I watched the early morning light over the canyon, feeling like a little speck of stardust in our vast universe.\nBonus: I was alone until the final mile when I saw three hikers. Like I\u2019m saying: a chill Yosemite!\nOther activities\n- Fishing is allowed in most areas of Kings Canyon. Those 16 and older must have a valid California fishing license. The park advises you should buy one before arriving, as they aren\u2019t always available in its markets. You are allowed to keep some of what you catch, including rainbow trout. You must follow daily limits, and must take note of the areas of the park that are catch-and-release only.\n- Horseback rides are sold through the Cedar Grove Pack Station. It offers one- and two-hour rides for $70 and $110, respectively, and half- ($180) and full-day ($230) trips. It also sells pack trips where mules and horses, led by a packer, carry your group and gear to a backcountry site.\n- Head underground to the Boyden Cavern, a marble cavern that features stalactites, stalagmites and other geological delights. A walking tour, which takes about an hour, will cost between $8 and $23 depending on age, date and time. Staff also offers a flashlight tour at 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. if at least four people buy tickets. That tour takes up to 75 minutes and is $35. The cavern is about 10 miles west of Cedar Grove off Highway 180.\n- Picnic near Grizzly Falls, an 80-foot waterfall in Sequoia National Forest, just under five miles from Cedar Grove. It\u2019s a short walk from your car to the picnic area where you can view the falls.\nRegardless of whether you spend your days relaxing along the South Fork, or hit the backcountry for more rugged hiking, you will return home feeling refreshed and energized. In an era where escaping the bustle of the city often means swapping one type of crowd for another, Kings Canyon is an underpopulated gem that, for now, proves that nature can still be peaceful."
