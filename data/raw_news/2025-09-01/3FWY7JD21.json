  "content": "India is campaigning for greater loan activity on its national digital payments network.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nAs the Financial Times (FT) reported Sunday (Aug. 31), The National Payments Corporation of India (NCPI), which runs the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), has begun offering its infrastructure to banks to extend short-term loans to small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have a large uncatered market for credit,\u201d NPCI Chief Executive Dilip Asbe said in an interview with FT, adding it was also exploring the facilitation of investments and insurance. \u201cUPI is now the infrastructure layer to provide the whole financial services business.\u201d\n\nUPI, which facilitates instant money transfers between bank accounts in India, has boomed in popularity since its launch in 2016 and now rivals Visa in terms of number of transactions, handling more than 600 million per day in July.\n\nThe system is part of the government\u2019s India Stack, a suite of digital tools that lets the country\u2019s 1.4 billion people verify their identity, access benefits and make mobile payments.\n\nBank account ownership has jumped significantly in India in the past decade, the report noted, citing data from the World Bank. In 2014, 53% of Indians had a bank account, compared to 89% last year.\n\nThis was partly driven by the government\u2019s effort to transfer cash to the poor directly into their accounts beginning in 2014. However, 16% of those accounts are not active, compared to an average of 4% in other low- and middle-income economies.\n\nAnd although users have now readily turned to UPI for daily transactions and money transfers, their use of the service for credit offerings is limited, Asbe said.\n\nBut now, banks can link credit lines, including loans backed by gold, property, fixed deposits, shares and mutual funds, to users\u2019 UPI apps. The disbursed funds can then be used for merchant payments, peer-to-peer transfers or cash withdrawals.\n\nThe NPCI\u2019s efforts are happening at a time when instant payments are becoming an important feature of lending, as PYMNTS wrote recently.\n\n\u201cWith inflation pinching household budgets and emergencies around every corner, consumers no longer consider instant disbursements a perk or convenience,\u201d that report said. \u201cThey expect them. In fact, borrowing payouts now lead all categories in instant disbursement usage, with 45% of consumers saying they most frequently receive their loan funds in real time.\u201d\n\nThe main reason, that report added, is urgency. PYMNTS Intelligence data shows that 64% of consumers want instant lending payouts because of financial need. More than a quarter of borrowers said they require the funds in 30 minutes or less.\n\n\u201cWhether paying for rent, groceries or a car repair, many borrowers can\u2019t afford to wait,\u201d PYMNTS wrote.",

      "text": "Speed is becoming the defining feature of lending, and borrowers are setting the pace. With inflation pinching household budgets and emergencies around every corner, consumers no longer consider instant disbursements a perk or convenience. They expect them. In fact, borrowing payouts now lead all categories in instant disbursement usage, with 45% of consumers saying they most frequently receive their loan funds in real time.\nThe top reason? Urgency. According to the latest PYMNTS Intelligence data, 64% of consumers want instant lending payouts due to financial need. More than one in four say they require the funds in 30 minutes or less. Whether paying for rent, groceries or a car repair, many borrowers can\u2019t afford to wait.\nBorrowers are also putting their money where their need is. Nearly three-quarters of consumer loan recipients are willing to pay a fee for immediate access to funds. Seven in 10 of these borrowers who want instant lending payouts cite convenience as a key reason for this demand. However, that willingness has limits. Transparency matters. When fees are hidden or show up after approval, satisfaction nosedives.\nFinancial institutions are responding. Eighty-six percent now see lending disbursements as a top use case for instant rails. The problem? Legacy systems and fragmented platforms are slowing delivery. While 57% of borrowers report being offered instant lending payouts, delays and friction remain widespread.\nWhat\u2019s clear is that real-time payments are no longer optional. For lenders, implementing instant loan disbursements means more than meeting demand\u2014it means staying relevant. Those who deliver on speed and transparency can build trust, streamline operations and improve borrower retention in an increasingly competitive landscape.\nAbout \u201cRace Against Time: How Urgency Shapes the Demand for Instant Lending Payouts\u201d\nThis edition of the \u201cMoney Mobility Tracker\u00ae,\u201d a collaboration with Ingo Payments, explores how financial urgency is reshaping the lending experience\u2014and why real-time disbursements are fast becoming the standard for meeting borrower expectations.\nSee More In: consumer lending, consumer loans, featured insights, Ingo Payments, instant disbursements, instant payments, Loan Payouts, Main Feature, Money Mobility, News, PYMNTS Intelligence, PYMNTS News, real time payments, Tracker Series"

The system handled 12 billion transactions last month, valued at $219 billion.\nThe announcement comes a little more than a year after the NPCI said it was expanding access to UPI to non-resident Indians in several countries, including Singapore, the U.K., Australia, Canada and the U.S.\n\u201cThere has been customer demand in the ecosystem to enable UPI for their [non-resident] accounts \u2026[to] experience the seamless and instant journey of UPI,\u201d the NPCI said.\nAs PYMNTS wrote at the time, the expansion illustrates how \u201cIndia is paving the path to payments interoperability \u2014 not just across providers, but across borders.\u201d\n\u201cFor payments to become truly ubiquitous \u2014 especially real-time remittances \u2014 countries\u2019 payments schemes have to connect, streamlining the direct transfer of funds,\u201d that report said."
