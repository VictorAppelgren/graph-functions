Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nIt's the late 1970s in America. In terms of fast food pizza, chains like Pizza Hut, Shakey's, and Domino's were on the rise -- each with hundreds of locations across the country. But, as popular as pizza was becoming, these chains didn't offer much in terms of the variety and creativity you'll see today. For example, a Pizza Hut menu from the '70s shows two types of pizza crusts -- \"Thin n' Crispy\" or \"Thick n' Chewy\" -- with mostly standard topping options, like pepperoni, sausage, and an assortment of vegetables.\n\nEnter Wolfgang Puck. In 1973, the future Michelin star award-winning chef would immigrate to the United States. from Europe. After earning his culinary stripes and wowing diners in West Hollywood, Wolfgang Puck opened his first restaurant, Spago, in 1982. A new movement called \"California Cuisine\" was developing, and Puck was one of the driving forces behind it. This cuisine was all about sourcing local ingredients and developing creative, fresh new flavor combinations.\n\nThat brings us back to pizza. Inspired by San Francisco chef Ed LaDou -- the developer of California Pizza Kitchen's first menu \u2014 and his creative takes on pizza, Puck set out to create his own form of nouveau pizza pies. From there, the idea of \"gourmet pizza\" was born, and Wolfgang Puck's star began to quickly rise. Within a decade, pizza took on forms well beyond a simple pepperoni and sausage pie. Perhaps Wolfgang Puck's most famous creation is the smoked salmon pizza \u2014 a far cry from Pizza Hut's $4.80 pepperoni pie at the time. It included a base of dill-infused cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche that was topped with cured in-house smoked salmon, caviar, and caramelized shallots. Puck also offered pizzas topped with duck sausage, shrimp, and smoked lamb and eggplant.\n\nRead more: A Guide To All The 3-Star Michelin Restaurants In The United States\n\nFrom Smoked Salmon Pizza To A New Way To Think About Food\n\nOne of Wolfgang Puck's core beliefs is that the way you cook should express the area in which you live and the ingredients that surround you, as he told UPROXX when interviewed about the 2021 documentary \"Wolfgang.\" When Spago opened, Puck said he didn't have access to fresh beef, so he didn't put steak on the menu. Instead, he chose lamb from a nearby farm and fish from a local fish market. Because Los Angeles is so multicultural, Puck also drew inspiration from all the other cuisines represented nearby. It was a form of authentic, honest cooking that Puck even introduced into the restaurant interior itself, as he was a pioneer of the open kitchen, where diners can see the chefs preparing their food.\n\nBy expanding the idea of what pizza could be, Puck expanded the idea of what all food could be, with the California cuisine movement serving as a forerunner to ideas like farm-to-table dining. He wasn't the first to drum up the idea of gourmet pizza, but he certainly took it to another level, having created a sensation with the 250 pizza varieties he served his A-list Hollywood clientele at Spago. While the traditional Italian-influenced pizza still dominates the market, and has itself been elevated (see chef Anthony Mangieri's Una Pizza Napoletana, the No. 1 ranked pizza in the world), pizzerias are continuing to try different ideas and combinations of ingredients with their pies. This kind of creativity has trickled over into other forms of cuisine, with menus around the world as evidence. It's impossible to deny that Wolfgang Puck was one of the driving forces behind pushing these new ideas into the mainstream.",

      "text": "I grew up with \u201cWolfgang Puck\u201d mostly as a brand name, the words on the boxes of frozen pizzas I ate by the dozen. I suppose I had a vague notion of him as an apple-cheeked European man with a twinkle in his eyes, but I had no idea about California Cuisine or open kitchens or any of his innovations. When he showed up as a judge on Top Chef a few years back, an entire competitive-cooking concept that almost surely wouldn\u2019t exist without him, it felt a little like we\u2019d skipped a chapter on the Wolfgang Puck DVD. And yet there he was, the most entertaining Top Chef guest judge ever (if memory serves he made someone cry over a risotto).\nWolfgang Puck finally gets his due as a documentary subject this week when Wolfgang, from David Gelb, director of Jiro Dreams of Sushi and creator of Netflix\u2019s Chef\u2019s Table, premieres on Disney+. Gelb attempts to fill in some of those gaps, covering Puck\u2019s many iterations as a public figure, from his early days as promising immigrant trying to to bring 1970s America\u2019s backward food culture into the modern era, to Hollywood\u2019s favorite chef at Spago, to becoming a media brand unto himself.\nBetween the historical recaps of Puck\u2019s success, both as a brand and as a proponent of \u201cCalifornia Cuisine,\u201d Wolfgang offers a dual portrait of Puck as an illegitimate child in Austria and Puck as the one-time king of chefs trying to settle into old age. The timing of it couldn\u2019t be better. With \u201ccelebrity chefs\u201d on almost every channel in some form or another, Wolfgang Puck is one of if not the \u201coriginal celebrity chef.\u201d\nThe open question is, where does that leave him today? What happens when your once-innovative recipes get so popular, and copied so often, that they start to seem dated? When you put your name on so many products that the guy who made it uncool to serve canned food in restaurants becomes synonymous with prepackaged foods?\nWithout getting too deep into introspection, mostly it leaves Puck rich, happy, and still wildly charming. Much as in his Top Chef appearance (which I distinctly remember had Tom Colicchio laughing so hard he had to wipe away tears), every time Puck talks he reminds you why he became a media darling in the first place. His combination of candidness, volubility, and instantly recognizable accent all but guarantee good footage.\nI got to speak to him this week to promote Wolfgang\u2018s release. Interviewing him was the same way. The sharp accent, the excitability \u2014 he\u2019s the kind of subject who makes you think you\u2019re getting great copy even when he\u2019s dodging a question. Because you are. When someone has been a famous chef/restaurateur/personality for going on 40 years, there aren\u2019t too many stories he could tell that wouldn\u2019t be interesting.\n\u2014\nSo the movie has a bit about your smoked salmon pizza. If there was a California cuisine dishes hall of fame, what dishes do you think would be on it?\nI think if you count it as a cooking style, a restaurant-style\u2026 it\u2019s really a whole combination of things. When we opened Spago that was an open kitchen. This was the first time, really, that a white tablecloth restaurant had that open kitchen. The restaurant was casual but the food was really the star on the plate. I said everything on the plate has to be serious, the best quality. I think that\u2019s really how this whole concept worked. Yes, there were famous dishes like this smoked salmon pizza. Or somebody just asked me yesterday, \u201cWhen are you going to make your goat cheese pasta you made at the old Spago. Why you don\u2019t put that on the menu?\u201d And so forth. So I think there will always be people who remember those. So the smoked salmon pizza or the duck sausage pizza, some dishes like the goat cheese pasta or, now obviously every restaurant does it, the tuna sashimi, the way I used to do that. They were all new things at that time. Nobody served raw fish in a restaurant. Today, everybody serves raw fish.\nWhat do you think that term California Cuisine means at this point? Is it still a useful way to describe food?\nI think it depends what restaurant it is. So when I opened Spago in Hollywood, 40 years ago, I designed the menu, and I thought cooking should express the territory where you live, the place in the world where you are. Our place here in LA is multicultural. So we have a Chinatown, Olvera Street, Little India, Downtown, Little Tokyo \u2014 you name it. So I thought our cooking should express different cultures, and then I said, cooking should also express ingredients we have around us. I didn\u2019t have cows around so I didn\u2019t have steak on the menu when I opened Spago. I had a farmer who raised lamb, so I used his lamb and we had the roasted baby lamb. I went to the fish market, down to San Pedro and got the squid and got the rock cod from there and roasted them whole with some onions from the farm nearby.\nI used to go down to the Chino Farm in a Rancho Sante Fe and picked up the best strawberries or melons or white corn. So that\u2019s how the whole thing came about, and when I designed the cover of the menu, I said, I don\u2019t know what style cuisine, so I just wrote on it \u201cCalifornia Cuisine.\u201d Did I think it\u2019s gonna stick, or people gonna talk about it? No. I just thought that\u2019s what we expressed, California. Because I always said if I would be in Provence, I would cook Provencal cuisine. If I would be in Southern Italy, I would make a dishes with a lot of butter and cream and fresh pasta. I would use olive oil, tomato, garlic, and basil.\nWhen you invent or become associated with a specific style like that, do you worry about the term being co-opted or becoming meaningless? Do you try to protect that designation in any way?\nWe cannot copyright things in the restaurant, in the food world. I cannot copyright the smoked salmon pizza or this or that. We write cookbooks and give people the exact recipe, the exact measurements and everything! So I think cooking is about giving, it\u2019s not about an egomaniac doing it. I\u2019m sure there are egomaniacs out there too, but I think to me, cooking is about giving pleasure to people, making people enjoy the time, making them feel good and that\u2019s the most important thing. I think David Gelb in the documentary really showed that beautifully in a way that even from my upbringing, which was very difficult, that at the end is really about making people happy.\nI heard Jacques Pepin speaking a while back, where he talked about coming to America in the seventies and not being able to find fresh mushrooms. He could only find canned and dried mushrooms. I was wondering what American food was like when you first came over here, and what were some of the things that you were surprised by?\nIt was so different than what is now for sure. I tell you when I was in the Bel-Air hotel in the eighties, I did a dinner \u2014 because they tried to expand their hotel. The hotel Bel-Air is a total neighborhood property, it\u2019s not the commercial district, so now all the houses around, they have to ask all the neighbors for permission to go forward with the expansion. So for the dinner I went to the Chino farm in Rancho Santa Fe, picked up peas, small carrots, green beans and I don\u2019t know what else, and I cooked them properly and I made the dinner for them. The beans looked like beans, totally normal green, a beautiful color and everything. And then they send a letter to the president of Rosewood then and said, \u201cMr. Zimmer, we expected good food at the Bel-Air hotel. Now you\u2019re bringing us colored vegetables? You put food color in the vegetable, that really should not be at the Bel-Air.\u201d\nSo he showed me that letter and I said, \u201cWhat the heck are they saying? What do you mean?\u201d I didn\u2019t even understand. So I go back to that Bel-Air, I go into their storeroom and I see canned asparagus, canned green beans, canned beans, and when you open them, they\u2019re all gray and overcooked. So I said, \u201cOh my God, this is really a sad story.\u201d\nEven at the Bistro Garden where Spago is now, I remember I went there and I was already at Ma Maison where I used great asparagus from the Stockton region and they have the green asparagus. At the Bistro Garden, they served the veal dish with white asparagus out of the can. So that was so traditional, that you could get things out of the can. But I was lucky because I found the Chino Ranch in Rancho Santa Fe and they had great vegetables. Then all of a sudden we had farmers who started to bring us chanterelles and porcini mushrooms and things like that too. So we started to get into that really well and I think a little by little, the whole food scene changed. There were no farmer\u2019s market then and now you have farmer\u2019s market everywhere. I think we are lucky and the young chefs are lucky to be cooking today, especially in California, where you get so many great ingredients.\nOn that note, how much savvier is the average diner now than in the eighties? What kind of things do you think that they expect now that they wouldn\u2019t have then?\nWell, in the old time, people were, very much\u2013 they know what they ate as a kid. It was very historical, almost, the cooking, nobody really wanted innovation. Nobody was really prepared to try new things. Now because of television you\u2019ll see so many different things. You can say, \u201cOh, I want to try that. I want to do that.\u201d I was just a judge on a newer Iron Chef series and they made dishes and I said, \u201cWow, this is really amazing,\u201d so now the people are going to see that out in the world and say, \u201cWow, you know what? This is really good. I want to try it too.\u201d\nPeople become more open-minded. But before it was very difficult. I remember when I was at Ma Maison, to undercook a fish was impossible. They sent it back all the time. I remember I undercook the salmon and the people said, \u201cWolfgang that\u2019s not cooked. What\u2019s wrong with you? Can\u2019t you cook a salmon?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, it tastes better that way.\u201d\nConversely, are there things that you had on the menu at Spago in the eighties that you couldn\u2019t get away with now?\nWell, I think when we opened Spago it created a whole new style of cooking because we had a charcoal grill, we had a wood-burning oven and everything. So everything was fresh and simple. We didn\u2019t have space to make it complicated. This day and age a lot of the young chefs, they still think the more things they have on a plate, the better their food would be. But it\u2019s not true. Or people doing things with tweezers, putting things on the food. I said, that\u2019s not necessary. If it\u2019s not really beautiful the way you buy it, don\u2019t do it. And what it\u2019s going to do, making little dots of sauce around the plate? People don\u2019t even touch them. So I think the quality of the food should be great and the flavors should be strong and you don\u2019t need a hundred different things around. By the time everybody puts that decor on their plate, the food is cold. And I like hot food hot and cold food cold.\nWhat did you like about the wood-fired oven so much?\nWell, because I grew up with it as a child in Austria, everything was wood-fired. We didn\u2019t have electricity. We didn\u2019t have gas. When I lived in Provence, I went to a restaurant and helped a friend of ours, really, he had this restaurant where he had simple food, I think mainly grilled food, like a steak, maybe lamb chops, and he had that wood-burning pizza oven. So I mean I was thinking about Spago and I was thinking about a restaurant similar like that. Then because I had to leave Ma Maison, I made it more upscale.\nYou talked about people not maybe being ready for undercooked salmon back in the day. Are there areas that you think are sort of the next frontier in cooking that the average diner hasn\u2019t a warmed up to yet right now?\nI don\u2019t know. People talk about eating crickets or eating the cicadas or whatever. I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t appeal to me. So for me, I don\u2019t want to cook something I don\u2019t want to eat, just because it becomes a fad or just because somebody saying it is good. I did that tryout with this Beyond Meat product and I tell you, I made a Philly cheesesteak with it. It was as good as any Philly cheesesteak I ever had.\nYou think that\u2019s a way to go that maybe we haven\u2019t reached its full potential yet?\nYeah, I definitely think so because some of these companies who do these inventions out of a laboratory making meat or making like meat out of plants, out of peas or beans or whatever using the proteins from plants, I think it definitely has a future because I think we definitely have to cut down on the greenhouse gases and we know how much it comes from the cows and everything. So maybe that will help. Maybe they can make it at a good price and it\u2019s still tasty. Now to me, it has to be done right to be tasty because by itself, I might as well prefer to have a real hamburger.\nThe movie talks about this to some extent, but do you ever think that your celebrity got in the way of you being a chef? What was it like trying to find a balance there?\nWell, I really tried to tell people that you can be a chef today and a businessman. I know a lot of food critics, a lot of papers they criticize, they think a chef should be behind the stove all the time. Now I tell you I\u2019m 71 years old. If I would have to stand behind the stove and serve 250 customers every night, I think my life would be cut short. I don\u2019t think we have to stop. If you want to be a boxer, they don\u2019t ask you to be a boxer when you are 50 years old or 60 years old. You become the trainer, and I\u2019m more like the coach and the trainer, I tell people what I want and taste the food with the way I like it. I teach the techniques and they have to execute and we have more than one restaurant.\nA lot of chefs out there today have more than one restaurant and I think I\u2019m happy and I\u2019m really proud of showing people that a chef is not somebody who is sitting in the background somewhere, a chef is not somebody who is in the dungeon cooking the food, and nobody knows about it. I\u2019m very proud to having lifted the profile of the chefs. Not only that they can be great cooks, but also great business people.\n\u2018Wolfgang\u2019 hits Disney+ June 25th.

      "text": "The 15 Biggest Pizza Mistakes, According To Chef Anthony Mangieri\nEverybody loves pizza, but few people love it as much as Anthony Mangieri. His beloved New York City pizzeria, Una Pizza Napoletana, just won Italian site 50 Top Pizza's much-coveted title of best pizza in the United States. Not for the first time, either: This is Mangieri's his third year in a row hitting the top spot in this global ranking. Aside from that, he's received rave reviews on various websites and publications from coast to coast.\nThere's good reason for this, of course. Mangieri is infatuated with pizza, and his passion took root at a young age; his mother would drive him to acclaimed pizza places throughout the New York metropolitan area. The interest didn't fade with youth, instead blossoming into a full-blown obsession Mangieri still nurtures \u2014 and now wins acclaim for \u2014 on the regular.\nToday, Una Pizza Napoletana's commander-in-chief focuses on daily experimentation, natural leavening, and high-quality ingredients. Think the best San Marzano tomatoes, Amalfi wild oregano, buffalo mozzarella DOP, and Sicilian sea salt. Given this abundance of knowledge, Chowhound was excited to sit down with Mangieri and get the inside story on his famous pizza recipe, pizza-making tips and tricks, and the biggest mistakes home chefs make when it comes to this most American of Italian foods.\n1. Using commercial yeast\nFirst things first: Everything begins with crust. Your crust is the literal foundation of your pizza, and if you don't nail it, you risk compromising the whole enterprise. According to Mangieri, to get it right, you must avoid commercial yeast at all costs and use natural leavening instead. Goodbye, jarred yeasts: \"Our dough at Una is only flour, water & salt,\" he explains. \"Nothing else.\"\nIf you've ever made your own sourdough, then you're already familiar with the concept of natural leavening. If not, a leavening agent simply means an ingredient that makes dough rise. Eggs, baking soda, baking powder, and yeast from a packet or jar are all leaveners. Of these, only yeast can be curated naturally in your environment (with the exception of raising chickens, one supposes). All you have to do is mix flour and water in a 2-to-1 ratio and let sit at room temperature, discarding half the mixture and replacing it with a new 2-to-1 mixture of flour and water every 24 hours. During this time, wild yeast present on surfaces and in the air will settle on your mixture and metabolize it, changing it chemically. On about the fifth day, you should have a bubbly, slightly sour-smelling starter perfect for use in crust.\nSound hard? Don't worry. \"Anyone can do this,\" Mangieri says. \"It takes time and patience to build a strong starter dough, and the more you use it the better you'll understand how to use it for pizza or bread.\"\n2. Not using enough water\nThe next mistake most chefs make with pizza crust is using too little water. Believe it or not, water is not an enemy of good pizza dough. Indeed, when you're reheating leftover pizza, water is the secret hack that will ensure gooey cheese while bringing your crust back to life. All you have to do is put a small pan of it in the oven along with your pizza stone while reheating, and it will liven up your leftovers until they taste almost like new. However, the importance of good old H20 starts much sooner than that.\nAccording to Mangieri, you should always make your dough with a lot of water. Don't be afraid of adding too much, he says, and don't respond to stickiness by dousing dough in gobs of flour. This reduces the dough's hydration, which can lead to a dense and dry result. When handling, embrace the stickiness instead ... that moisture is what will lead to great crust with a nice, light crunch. If you really need to, you can add a little oil to prevent sticking, but try to learn to live without.\n3. Cooking too quickly\nWhen trying to conquer great pizza, the first thing most chefs learned (this writer included) was that pizza should be cooked hot and quick. Out with your standard baking temperatures and in with higher-than-high heat! Folks are routinely told to crank up the oven as high as it will go, blast the pie for a short period, and enjoy the Sahara-like results on their dough.\nHowever, Mangieri says, this advice is wrong. Cooking your pizza too quickly leads to uneven results and un-crispy crust. Instead, he advises people to bake it slower than normal, making sure to use lots of water in your dough. The lower heat will ensure even cooking. For thin crust, you'll want to set the oven higher and cook for a shorter amount of time than for a thick crust, which calls for lower heat and longer baking. Check your recipe to be sure, and experiment to find out what works for your oven, since too low a temperature can result in soggy pizza dough.\nAlso, make sure not to overcrowd the oven, Mangieri says. At Una Pizza Napoletana, only three pies are carefully placed to baked in the wood-fired oven at one time. This ensures even cooking and delicious results. Even if you don't have a wood-fired oven, you should still use this no-crowding mindset in the kitchen.\n4. Adding cornmeal to the bottom of your pie\nChowhound was curious about Mangieri's take on cornmeal as well. From family fun centers to ostensibly authentic Italian dining, you'll find coarsely ground cornmeal on the bottom of many a pie. What's the deal?\nThe short answer is that cornmeal helps the pizza not stick when being transferred to the oven. It's got nothing to do with the taste and certainly isn't a traditional Italian addition. When asked for the yea or nay on cornmeal, Mangieri's response was a resounding \"Nay. It adds too much of another flavor to your pizza.\" Avoid it, instead dusting with a little bit of flour if necessary. Semolina is a traditional Italian ingredient, and you don't need much to ensure an easy slide into the oven, especially if you're using a pizza peel. (You know, the paddle-looking transfer thingie.) A dough scraper also helps, and Mangieri uses one in his practice.\nWatch out for cornmeal in the real world too. This could be a pizza shop red flag, so you might want to look elsewhere for your next slice.\n5. Selecting the wrong tomatoes\nTomatoes are oh-so-crucial when it comes to pizza, and using the wrong ones is a mistake made by many a home chef. Mangieri advises cooks to \"Keep it simple & use the very best fresh (when in season) or canned tomatoes.\"\nHow do you find good tomatoes in season? The farmers market is a great place to start. If you see them there, you can guarantee they're fresh off the vine. Typically, fruits and veggies at the farmers market are harvested at peak ripeness and were probably picked within the last day or so. Ideally, look for tomatoes that are meaty with few seeds, such as Roma or other paste varieties. They can be good at the grocery store as well, but look for ones that are local and likely to have been picked recently when fully ripe. If you can't find good tomatoes in season, then opt for canned ones. San Marzano are the best bet, says Mangieri.\n6. Overcomplicating your sauce\nRemember, it's tomato sauce, so it should be all about the tomatoes. Many people make the mistake of overcomplicating the sauce, Mangieri says, thereby unintentionally disguising the fresh and delicious flavor of well-ripened tomatoes. That leads to competing flavors, and, ironically, reduces the complexity and nuance of the finished product.\nTo make sauce at Una Pizza Napoletana, Mangieri drains San Marzanos from a can, cuts the ends off, and squishes them with his hands. Growing near Mount Vesuvius and benefiting from the volcanic minerals in the soil, these tomatoes are slightly acidic and not as sweet as other varieties. They make for a perfect sauce all on their own; there's no need to add anything else.\nIf you really want to make a sauce with other ingredients, choose a simple recipe. You shouldn't need more than a bit of salt, garlic, and oil, along with a pinch of oregano, if desired.\n7. Forgetting about other sauces\nBut hey, what's life without a little variety? Other sauces exist as well, and Mangieri by no means advises limiting oneself to tomatoes alone. Asked for another option, he says, \"Pesto is really fun. And you can top with mozzarella and finish with good ricotta.\"\nPlus, pesto is dead easy. All you have to do is combine pine nuts (or walnuts, if pine nuts are too expensive), lemon, garlic, salt, pepper, basil, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese in a food processor and run it until you achieve a smooth sauce. It comes out the perfect consistency for spreading on pizza dough and topping with cheese, meat, and veggies. Just make sure to follow your recipe's ratios when making the sauce. They matter.\nOther cooks advise all kinds of other sauces with which to experiment as well. You can use white sauce, glaze, or a thin smear of tomato paste to lend that tomato flavor without loading up the crust.\n8. Opting for cheap toppings\nSo, what are the biggest mistakes vis-\u00e0-vis toppings? Honestly, the advice is pretty simple: \"Cheap toppings don't taste great,\" Mangieri explains. \"Use the best and freshest you can find and make sure when combining toppings that it makes sense.\"\nWe've all been guilty of buying the cheap mozzarella when the budget gets tight, or of wanting to prioritize quantity over quality. But while it's tempting to ball outrageous through the jarred good aisle and the cured meat department, getting absolutely everything that's on sale, it's better to limit yourself to just a few nice ingredients. At this point, you won't be surprised that Mangieri's advice is to \"keep it light.\"\nThat's not to say you can't find nice toppings for a great price. Ethnic food stores and Grocery Outlet, for instance, are both places where you can find lovely imported foods for a fraction of the cost at your neighborhood grocery store.\n9. Going overboard when topping\nSpeaking as someone who loved to buy frozen Totino's pizza in her youth, then go home and add way too many toppings and call it fine dining, you can trust Mangieri's next piece of advice: Limit your toppings. Just as too many cooks can spoil the soup, too many toppings can unbalance the delicate flavor combinations that make good pizza really good. So while it's tempting to employ every budget-friendly frozen pizza hack you can find, use a light hand.\nChoose subtle flavor combinations of only three or four ingredients. At Una Pizza Napoletana, you'll find that most pies are limited to sauce, cheese, sea salt, and garlic or herbs. Try it on for size ... you might like elegantly spare pizzas more than you think.\nOh, and as for Totino's? You'll be delighted to know that Mangieri just launched Genio Della Pizza. It took 3 years to create the perfect high-quality frozen pizza, but you can now try Anthony's craft firsthand with his artisan frozen pizza line, available through Whole Foods, GoPuff, Goldbelly, Sprouts, and more.\n10. Adding toppings at the wrong time\nMany home cooks assume you should add pizza toppings in the beginning, before you pop your pizza in the oven. However, Mangieri says, you should let the ingredient guide you. \"It really depends on the topping. Some before, some after,\" he says. \"For example, fresh cheeses or delicate fresh herbs are best after baking. When using raw veggies I like to slice them super thin and put them on before baking.\"\nThere are some firm rules, though. For instance, you should always precook meat, which might not get enough heat in the oven to cook safely. The same goes for precooking mushrooms as pizza toppings. These, although safe in a raw state, can release too much water into your pizza if they are not precooked. Make sure to put cheese at the bottom, which not only protects the crust with a layer of fat, it also prevents the cheese from forming a layer over other ingredients that might prevent thorough cooking.\n11. Forgetting about lemon\nOne mistake many home bakers make, according to Mangieri? Not using lemon on pizza. Although this might seem like an odd ingredient, it is actually quite popular across the interwebz. If you're looking for a new spin on an old Friday night treat, this could be the ticket to impress friends, family, and neighbors.\nLemon and cheese have always paired well together, as do lemon and bread, so it's really no surprise that they make a dynamic duo in pizza. On the Amalfi coast, lemon makes its appearance both within the crust, baked right into the dough, as well as strewn across the top in the form of zest. Other pizzas use very thin lemon slices scattered between also-thin slices of Italian cheese, such as piave and fontina. Parmesan and mozzarella are also popular paired with lemon.\nHow you sauce your pizza will depend on the recipe you're using. However, note that many pizzas employing the lemon approach skip tomato sauce and use basic extra virgin olive oil for the base, or omit it entirely and drizzle the oil over the top.\n12. Overspicing and undersalting\nThe reason everyone loves Mangieri's pizza is because it is perfectly understated. The emphasis on perfect ingredients over elaborate creations is what has earned it the love of critics everywhere, as well as its impressive trophy case. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that one of Mangieri's biggest complaints is when food is over-spiced.\n\"But that seems to be the case in most forms of cooking lately,\" he laments. \"That being said, don't be afraid of salt. It brings out the flavors of all the other ingredients. Since Una started I've been using coarse sea salt on the pizzas for little pops of salt here and there.\"\nIf you do find you've over-seasoned something, he adds, you can always add a little olive oil to neutralize it and bring out the other flavors. Other times, you just have to shrug and walk away. Who knew making pizza could be such a good acceptance practice?\n13. Using vegan cheese\nVegan cheese is a hot topic these days. Non-dairy cheese substitutes are indeed getting better and some advocate strongly for their increases in creaminess and meltability, but Mangieri would still prefer to keep them far away from his dining room.\n\"I don't use it,\" he says. \"I would prefer a tomato pizza like marinara and just skip the cheese if cheese is an issue.\" He does put his money where his mouth is, though: Una Pizza Napoletana offers a cheese-less marinara pizza that puts the focus on crust, sauce, and herbs, ideal for the vegans among us. (Note that there's a difference between marinara and margherita pizza. Though they sound quite similar, one means without cheese, the other is with fresh mozzarella.)\nThis is where the importance of crust comes in. If you've mastered your recipe and have gotten over your fear of water, you can top it with something as simple as cherry tomatoes and a light sprinkling of chili flakes.\n14. Expecting perfection every time\nPerfection is the enemy of progress, as Winston Churchill once said. It is tempting to give up when something doesn't go our way, but that's a mistake, according to the obsessively experimental Mangieri. He is still trying out new variations and tweaks to this day, nearly four decades after making his first naturally leavened dough after discovering the deliciousness of Neapolitan pizza firsthand.\n\"I am still working on it after 37 years,\" he says, adding, \"Your pizza may not look pretty or be a perfect circle. That's totally okay; sometimes ugly is delicious.\" Black bubbles in the crust are normal, cheese doesn't always spread evenly, sometimes you forget to set the timer. But the beauty of pizza is in the trying. The most joy, for him, comes when \"for a brief moment I feel like it's all coming together and working the way I hoped. The dough, the oven, the toppings, the dining room.\" Don't get used to that feeling, though. \"It can truly feel like magic, but it's fleeting.\"\nThat's not to say attention to detail doesn't matter, though. Laser focus is the reason Mangieri only has one location today. Since opening, Anthony has made each and every pizza dough himself, and the restaurant does not open for service unless he is able to be there. That kind of dedication can only stem from his secret tip: \"You have to feel love and gratitude or your food won't taste as good.\"\n15. Not making the effort with food and wine pairings\nThe last mistake many people make is focusing only on the pizza. However, rarely do we eat pizza on its own. Whether serving personal pies or making them family-sized, they usually come with salads, wines, and desserts. It's worth putting in the time to ensure a fully finished presentation before serving guests.\nTo the question of what pairs well with pizza, Mangieri has several answers. \"A beautiful seasonal salad or some type of vegetable, possibly cooked in the same type of way as your pizza,\" he says. \"For beverages, try sparkling water, L'ippa Beer by Baladin, Gragnano wine from the Campania region of Italy, Champagne, and wines from the Burgundy region of France.\"\nThe good news is that a quick Google search will net you lucrative results when it comes to pairings. For instance, Prosecco pairs well with supreme pizzas, while pinot noir is a good option for plain cheese. Try sangiovese for pepperoni, and chardonnay for veggie lovers."

      "text": "Here's Exactly How Many Michelin Stars Wolfgang Puck Currently Holds\nWolfgang Puck may be a household name now, but before he reigned over a culinary empire of more than 100 restaurants, he was just a small boy in Austria, captivated by his pastry chef mother's cooking. Born in 1949, Puck began formal chef training at 14. He cut his teeth in prestigious French establishments, including Maxim's in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monaco, and the three-Michelin-starred L'Oustau de Baumani\u00e8re in Provence, before jetting to the United States in 1974.\nIt was almost a decade later, in 1982, when Puck launched his first restaurant in West Hollywood. Since then, he's fueled a fine dining revolution with his open kitchens, fusion flavors, and relaxed yet refined service, finding their way into eateries in cities including London, Budapest, Bahrain, and Bodrum.\nSo, how many Michelin stars does he have? Two \u2013 both for sites in his upscale steakhouse chain, CUT. The first CUT site, at the Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, bagged the award just a year after opening in 2007. The Michelin Guide promises it's not \"pulling any punches when it comes to luxury.\" On the menu, you'll find top-notch beef alongside house-knotted pretzels, chilled seafood, and wagyu tallow French fries \u2013 a must order. CUT Singapore, at Marina Bay Sands, received a Michelin Star in 2016 and is recognized by the Guide for its quality steaks and flavors. His flagship, Spago Beverly Hills, had stars at one point but lost them in later years.\nA series of achievements\nIn 2017, Puck received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a rare achievement for a chef, and was named the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association's Gold Plate Winner a month later. In 2022, he was also recognized as one of the \"100 most powerful people in global hospitality\" by the International Hospitality Institute. His list of achievements also includes cooking for the stars at celebrity events and scoring the James Beard Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012.\nWhile he's now king of the global culinary sphere, with brands like Wolfgang Puck Fine Dining Group, Wolfgang Puck Catering, and Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, Puck remains deeply connected to his roots. His menus often nod to his Austrian childhood, with dishes like Wienerschnitzel (an Austrian spin on chicken-fried steak) and Kaiserschmarrn appearing alongside modern fare, such as his iconic smoked salmon pizza. He may now be cooking for the whole world, but he has never forgotten where it all began."

      "text": "How Wolfgang Puck Used Pizza To Change How People Thought About Cooking In America\nIt's the late 1970s in America. In terms of fast food pizza, chains like Pizza Hut, Shakey's, and Domino's were on the rise \u2014 each with hundreds of locations across the country. But, as popular as pizza was becoming, these chains didn't offer much in terms of the variety and creativity you'll see today. For example, a Pizza Hut menu from the '70s shows two types of pizza crusts \u2014 \"Thin n' Crispy\" or \"Thick n' Chewy\" \u2014 with mostly standard topping options, like pepperoni, sausage, and an assortment of vegetables.\nEnter Wolfgang Puck. In 1973, the future Michelin star award-winning chef would immigrate to the United States. from Europe. After earning his culinary stripes and wowing diners in West Hollywood, Wolfgang Puck opened his first restaurant, Spago, in 1982. A new movement called \"California Cuisine\" was developing, and Puck was one of the driving forces behind it. This cuisine was all about sourcing local ingredients and developing creative, fresh new flavor combinations.\nThat brings us back to pizza. Inspired by San Francisco chef Ed LaDou \u2014 the developer of California Pizza Kitchen's first menu \u2014 and his creative takes on pizza, Puck set out to create his own form of nouveau pizza pies. From there, the idea of \"gourmet pizza\" was born, and Wolfgang Puck's star began to quickly rise. Within a decade, pizza took on forms well beyond a simple pepperoni and sausage pie. Perhaps Wolfgang Puck's most famous creation is the smoked salmon pizza \u2014 a far cry from Pizza Hut's $4.80 pepperoni pie at the time. It included a base of dill-infused cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche that was topped with cured in-house smoked salmon, caviar, and caramelized shallots. Puck also offered pizzas topped with duck sausage, shrimp, and smoked lamb and eggplant.\nFrom smoked salmon pizza to a new way to think about food\nOne of Wolfgang Puck's core beliefs is that the way you cook should express the area in which you live and the ingredients that surround you, as he told UPROXX when interviewed about the 2021 documentary \"Wolfgang.\" When Spago opened, Puck said he didn't have access to fresh beef, so he didn't put steak on the menu. Instead, he chose lamb from a nearby farm and fish from a local fish market. Because Los Angeles is so multicultural, Puck also drew inspiration from all the other cuisines represented nearby. It was a form of authentic, honest cooking that Puck even introduced into the restaurant interior itself, as he was a pioneer of the open kitchen, where diners can see the chefs preparing their food.\nBy expanding the idea of what pizza could be, Puck expanded the idea of what all food could be, with the California cuisine movement serving as a forerunner to ideas like farm-to-table dining. He wasn't the first to drum up the idea of gourmet pizza, but he certainly took it to another level, having created a sensation with the 250 pizza varieties he served his A-list Hollywood clientele at Spago. While the traditional Italian-influenced pizza still dominates the market, and has itself been elevated (see chef Anthony Mangieri's Una Pizza Napoletana, the No. 1 ranked pizza in the world), pizzerias are continuing to try different ideas and combinations of ingredients with their pies. This kind of creativity has trickled over into other forms of cuisine, with menus around the world as evidence. It's impossible to deny that Wolfgang Puck was one of the driving forces behind pushing these new ideas into the mainstream."
