  "content": "OLDWICK, N.J., August 20, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of \"a+\" (Excellent) of American Interstate Insurance Company (Omaha, NE), Silver Oak Casualty, Inc. (Omaha, NE) and American Interstate Insurance Company of Texas (Austin, TX) (collectively referred to as AMERISAFE Insurance Group). Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of \"bbb+\" (Good) of AMERISAFE, Inc. (headquartered in DeRidder, LA) [NASDAQ: AMSF], the ultimate parent of the group members. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.\n\nThe ratings reflect AMERISAFE Insurance Group\u2019s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.\n\nAMERISAFE Insurance Group\u2019s balance sheet strength assessment remains at the very strong level supported by its strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best\u2019s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), conservative investment portfolio, and prudent reserving philosophy. Loss reserves have been consistently redundant on a calendar and accident year basis. The group\u2019s policyholder surplus position has been constrained by stockholder dividends; however, these dividends are considered a strategic capital management tool within the group. Overall, surplus has declined due to extraordinary dividends paid to the parent company from excess capital accumulation from the group\u2019s strong earnings over the past 10-year period. The ultimate parent\u2019s balance sheet is clean with no debt.\n\nThe group\u2019s operating performance continues to be strong due to management\u2019s underwriting discipline and proactive claims management approach. Strict pricing and conservative risk selection have held solid despite declining rate trends in recent years. This has led to robust underwriting and operating results that continue to outperform AM Best\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation (WC) composite metrics. Return on equity, both pre- and post-tax, continues to outperform similarly assessed peers. In addition, the group\u2019s prudent reserving philosophy has resulted in favorable loss reserve development, which has contributed historically to strong loss metrics.\n\nThe group provides WC coverages primarily to small- and medium-sized employers in high hazard industries. Management\u2019s specialized knowledge of these hazardous industries has helped the group manage the business efficiently and provide value-added services to its policyholders, and this has resulted in high retention levels.",
