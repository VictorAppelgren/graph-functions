      "summary": "New York parents are projected to spend $1,348 per child on back‑to‑school supplies in 2025, a 20% jump from last year and the highest in the country, while NY teachers will spend an average of $1,397 on classroom items, up 29% from 2024. Nationally, parents expect to spend $774 per child (10% rise) and teachers $1,021 (12% rise), with 95% of teachers using personal funds and 30% taking side jobs to cover costs. The data highlight escalating financial pressure on families and educators, driven by rising supply prices and insufficient public funding.",
