      "feedback": "The draft correctly frames US-China trade as a two-regime frame and anchors near-term risk around a 90-day tariff truce with a 30% baseline and a Nvidia licensing framework (~15% revenue share), but to reach world-class quality you should (1) tighten the causal chain: show precisely how Regime A lowers policy uncertainty and inflation pass-through and how that translates into valuations/flows for AI hardware and semis, then contrast with Regime B’s tightening of export controls and higher policy risk premia that disrupt cross-border tech flows; cite the mechanism after each claim (OATKNJQ0E for Regime A, NOTMRPS8C for Regime B) and avoid generic language by naming the macro channels (growth/inflation/risk premia, capex/tech shipment timing). (2)Strengthen the scenario structure by listing explicit triggers that flip regimes (renewal/extension of the 90-day truce; specific Nvidia licensing terms; any export-control posture shifts or policy statements from Washington or Beijing) and treating a no-change baseline as a separate scenario with clear implications. (3)Quantify where possible using the provided numbers and frame implications for valuations/flows with directional language (e.g., Regime A compresses risk premia and stabilizes AI-related valuations; Regime B raises cross-border costs and valuation risk) rather than vague statements; only use numbers present in the sources. (4)Build a compact watch-list of decisive signals with near-term timing: 90-day truce extension decision, Nvidia licensing terms update, upcoming export-control policy moves, and any substantive bilateral policy statements or indicators of China leverage, plus plausible market-inspired signals (cross-border flow shifts, capex timing). (5)Reconcile conflicts by stating a clear current stance (e.g., “as of the latest signaling, Regime A remains the baseline unless the cited triggers materialize”), and ensure every claim links to the two sources (OATKNJQ0E, NOTMRPS8C). (6)Deliver as one compact paragraph, but maintain SECTION FOCUS by integrating macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals, and replace generic phrasing with precise, sourced language.",
