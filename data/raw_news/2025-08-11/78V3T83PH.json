  "title": "Slow Ventures cuts first check from $60M creator fund into woodworking founder",
  "description": "This marks the first investment for Slow\u2019s $60 million Creator Fund since its launch in February. The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.",
  "content": "Slow Ventures\u2019 Creator Fund has invested $2 million into Jonthan Katz-Moses, a popular woodworking content creator with around 600,000 followers, nearly 75 million video views, and his own line of woodworking tools.\n\nThis marks the first investment for Slow\u2019s $60 million Creator Fund since its launch in February. The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, \u201coff-platform,\u201d businesses.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who\u2019ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,\u201d Parks said.\n\nHe said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, \u201cnot chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.\u201d\n\nThis is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he\u2019s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow\u2019s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.\n\nKatz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive.\n\nShortly after that, he went into woodworking, deciding it was time to chase his dreams and leave behind anything unfulfilling. He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.\n\nKatz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow\u2019s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.\n\n\u201cBilly Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he\u2019d like to meet,\u201d Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cWhen we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,\u201d Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.\n\nParks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It\u2019s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund).\n\nSlow\u2019s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)\n\nParks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. \u201cThat combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,\u201d Parks continued. It\u2019s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.\n\nSince the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looking at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. \u201cThe goal is to post across all major platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our primary focus will always be YouTube.\u201d",

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "When Slow Ventures announced that it would set aside $20 million to invest in individual creators, GP Sam Lessin responded to onlookers\u2019 confusion with a memorable quip: \u201cit\u2019s def not indentured servitude.\u201d\nThough Lessin\u2019s remarks weren\u2019t very reassuring, these sorts of venture deals \u2014 investments in people, as opposed to companies \u2014 have started to seem a little less bizarre. Companies like Spotter and Jellysmack underwrite YouTubers\u2019 back catalog in exchange for upfront cash, while Creative Juice will fund a creator in exchange for a cut of revenue over a set term. Mythical, the entertainment studio owned by YouTube stars Rhett and Link, launched a $5 million venture capital fund for creators in 2021.\nThat same year, Slow Ventures made a deal with Marina Mogilko, a language learning YouTuber and co-founder of the platform LinguaTrip. In exchange for $1.7 million in capital, she will give the venture firm 5% of her earnings for 30 years \u2014 plus, they keep that 5% stake in any IP she develops within those three decades. As she explained to VICE, \u201cIf I wrote a book in 2030, and it\u2019s still selling in 100 years or whatever, they\u2019re still getting 5% of that revenue.\u201d\nAccording to Slow Ventures principal Megan Lightcap, the firm has inked six or seven deals with creators thus far, and hopes to close a few more before the end of the year. Two years ago, when the firm wrote a check to Mogilko, this practice seemed intimidating at best, and predatory at worst.\n\u201cHonestly, with any seed-stage investment, it\u2019s risky,\u201d Lightcap told TechCrunch. But investing in human beings as opposed to companies creates extra barriers, legal concerns and moral considerations. \u201cA portion of our creators may wake up in five years and be like, \u2018No, I want to go to law school.\u2019\u201d\nAnd if a Slow-backed creator did decide to go to law school, they wouldn\u2019t pay any penalty to the venture firm. These deals don\u2019t require that creators remain on their YouTube grind forever, but Lightcap explains that this flexibility is why the firm structured deals to persist over decades.\n\u201cThe way we keep the cost of capital low is to be deeply aligned with the creator over the long term,\u201d Lightcap said. \u201cWe want to be able to say that in year seven or whatever, if they launch a really interesting company and it takes off and that\u2019s where the value is, we need to be able to participate in that upside to keep the cost of capital inexpensive.\u201d\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Lightcap says she\u2019s looking for the next Steve Rinella \u2014 the multi-hyphenate creator behind the MeatEater series \u2014 as opposed to the next iconic lifestyle vlogger.\n\u201cWe want to back creators that have multiple ideas and want to be a little more risk-on, and to have more at bats, versus, say, just making a couple of hires and generally investing in content,\u201d Lightcap told TechCrunch.\nFrom a venture standpoint, creator businesses might even be more appealing than an early-stage startup, since creator businesses will almost always be profitable by the time they\u2019re big enough to catch a firm\u2019s eye. Creators generally work toward profitability from day one, whereas it\u2019s normal for even a late-stage startup to be losing money.\nSlow isn\u2019t public about most of the creators it\u2019s investing in, nor the terms of their deals. But Mythical is publicly backing Jarvis Johnson, Daniel Trasher and The Sorry Girls. Mythical also wouldn\u2019t share how much capital these creators got, but their total fund is $5 million and hasn\u2019t been fully spent yet, so we can make a guess. These creators are likely getting about $1 million in capital, whereas last year, YouTube sensation MrBeast was rumored to be shopping for a $150 million check at a $1.5 billion valuation.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Mythical\u2019s creators are small potatoes, though. Each of these three YouTube channels have more than 2 million subscribers \u2014 such popular channels can sometimes make more than $50,000 per month off of ad revenue alone.\nMythical is a wholly independent studio owned by Rhett and Link, which has raised no outside capital or debt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s independently financed, which gives us a lot of freedom and flexibility in our investment style,\u201d said Neel Yalamarthy, Mythical\u2019s SVP of strategy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have rigid timelines or targets, though we want all of our investees to grow and build companies that one day could become the size of Mythical, or even greater.\u201d\nThough the entertainment industry as a whole has suffered from decreased ad revenue, Mythical looks toward these investments as a way to embrace the changing media landscape.\n\u201cA great example is the Sorry Girls, and how they\u2019re working to create content that\u2019s akin to HGTV, but for digital audiences, or Daniel Thrasher, who is very much in the Bo Burnham lane, or Jarvis Johnson, who we think is comparable to Jon Stewart and The Daily Show,\u201d Yalamarthy told TechCrunch.\nMythical is thinking more about how they can invest in a creator to build something akin to a TV channel, while Slow is looking toward e-commerce and apps. Lightcap believes creators are more well-positioned than traditional brands to sell a variety of products while remaining authentic.\n\u201cThink about Lola, or any of these next-gen tampon companies,\u201d Lightcap told TechCrunch. \u201cIf they were to launch supplements, it\u2019d maybe feel a little weird and disingenuous to customers, whereas if you have a creator broadly in the women\u2019s health space, they can launch a whole bunch of different products.\u201d\nSlow and Mythical seem to be doing well thus far, though it\u2019s still early for their creator investments. But the question remains: Is it ethical to treat a human being like a company and make a deal encompassing all of their potential IP? And is it beneficial for venture funds to underwrite people anyway? If a startup founder is caught doing something awful, they can usually leave and the business may eventually recover. But people are different.\nAmid allegations of a sexual assault that occurred on his filming set, YouTube star David Dobrik stepped down from Dispo, the photo app that he co-founded. Three venture firms that invested in Dispo \u2014 Spark Capital, Seven Seven Six and Unshackled Ventures \u2014 severed ties with the app, some promising to donate any possible profits from their investment to organizations helping survivors of sexual assault.\nThen again, even \u201ccanceled\u201d creators can still maintain an audience. Despite an additional controversy about a near-fatal accident on Dobrik\u2019s set, the 27-year-old remains on the map. He runs a pizza shop in Los Angeles, and he\u2019s one of the top creators on Snapchat.\nAt the end of the day, if something were to go horribly wrong, these firms are only out a few million dollars. In the world of venture, that\u2019s a drop in the bucket.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll see a person IPO one day,\u201d Lightcap said.\nSpotter raises $200M to invest $1 billion into YouTubers\u2019 back catalogs"

      "text": "The team at early-stage VC firm Slow Ventures last week launched a $60 million fund entirely dedicated to investing in creators, with an eye toward helping them launch businesses. The idea is that the same entrepreneurial spirit and niche expertise that has helped creators build community is what would make them great founders.\nAccording to Slow Ventures partner Megan Lightcap, it comes down to trust and audience attachment.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting about creators is oftentimes they start [on YouTube], right? Because it\u2019s the most obvious place to begin,\u201d Lightcap explains, \u201cBut the difference between creator-led opportunities and what opportunities may exist for an existing brand is that, because the audience attaches to the creator as a whole person, the surface area and permission of what they can go build is actually much greater than, you know, a singular product coming.\u201d\nToday on Equity, Rebecca Bellan sits down with Lightcap to dive into the unique way Slow Ventures has structured its creator fund, why YouTube remains the dominant platform for serious creators, how niche community trust translates into scalable businesses, and what this new fund means for the creator economy.\nListen to the full episode to hear more about:\n- How this \u201cnew asset class\u201d has the potential to scale.\n- The firm\u2019s success stories so far, including Marina Mogilko\u2019s baby snack company and other ventures.\n- The parallels between backing creators and traditional seed-stage founders.\n- The \u201ckey man risk\u201d and how investors navigate the challenge.\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.

  "argos_summary": "Slow Ventures has invested $2 million in woodworking creator Jonathan Katz-Moses, marking the first investment from its $60 million Creator Fund aimed at helping influencers build sustainable businesses. Katz-Moses, who has a significant following and a line of tools, transitioned to woodworking after a life-changing assault in 2010. The fund seeks to support creators who think like entrepreneurs, focusing on long-term growth and off-platform ventures, reflecting a broader trend of venture capital investing in individual creators rather than traditional companies.",
