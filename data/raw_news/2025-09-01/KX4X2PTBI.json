  "title": "At Least 250 Dead And 500 Injured After Strong Earthquake Strikes Afghanistan",
  "description": "The epicenter of the 6.0 magnitude temblor struck near the Afghan-Pakistan border, and the death toll is expected to rise.",
  "content": "At least 250 people have died and hundreds more have been injured after a powerful earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan near the country\u2019s border with Pakistan, the latest in a series of deadly seismic events the country has faced in the past few years. Injured Afghan people receive treatment at a hospital after an earthquake in Afghanistan's Jalalabad.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey\u2019s tracker, the 6.0 magnitude quake\u2019s epicenter was located approximately 17 miles from Jalalabad, a city with a population of around 300,000 people. At only 5 miles deep, Sunday\u2019s earthquake was a shallow one, which tends to be more destructive. The Associated Press reported that the quake has injured at least 500 people, and the authorities believe the death toll could rise from 250. According to The New York Times, aftershocks of the earthquake could be felt in Kabul throughout Sunday night, although it is unclear if there were any casualties in the Afghan capital, located 100 miles away from Jalalabad.\n\nIn a post on X, a spokesperson for Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban run government, Zabihullah Mujahid, said: \u201cSadly, tonight's earthquake has caused loss of life and property damage in some of our eastern provinces. Local officials and residents are currently engaged in rescue efforts for the affected people.\u201d",
