The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a think tank partly funded by the Australian defence department, stated that Goerte's alignment with the ruling Communist Party (CCP), which goes beyond the established \u2018norm\u2019 for Chinese companies, raises significant national-security concerns. Last week, investment firm Haylo Labs bought Plymouth-based Plessey. The deal is being financed by a five-year $100m loan from GoerTE, a major supplier to tech companies including Apple and Meta.",
