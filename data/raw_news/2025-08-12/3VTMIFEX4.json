After going back and forth to the doctor for medicine, the headaches persisted until last week when she became unconscious. These headaches left her unresponsive and caused her to almost succumb to her illness. With quick action from expert doctors, they did emergency brain surgery removing a bleeding hematoma that formed due to the car accident 42 years ago.\nThe surgery was a success and she must now heal and recover. As of today it is not known how long she will be in recovery because of her recent bout with cancer and spinal cord injury.\nDanielle was recovering at home in Virginia with the assistance of home health care aides daily who were focusing on physical and occupational therapy for some memory loss, slurred speech and to teach her how to walk again.

      "text": "Danielle Spencer, who played the precocious youngster Dee Thomas on the 1970s ABC sitcom What\u2019s Happening!!, has died. She was 60.\nSpencer died Monday in a hospital in Richmond, Virginia, her What\u2019s Happening!! co-star Haywood Nelson told The Hollywood Reporter.\nShe was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy in 2014 and in 2018 underwent emergency surgery to relieve bleeding on her brain. A GoFundMe page was set up to help her pay for her medical expenses.\nRelated Stories\n\u201cShe suffered for a very long time but did it with a great deal of courage,\u201d Nelson said.\nCo-produced by All in the Family\u2018s Bud Yorkin, What\u2019s Happening!! was loosely based on the 1975 film Cooley High (Eric Monte wrote the movie screenplay and created the Watts-based sitcom). After a successful four-week run that started in August 1976, the comedy returned in November of that year and then for another two seasons.\nSpencer played Dee, the smart-aleck younger sister of Roger \u201cRaj\u201d Thomas (Ernest Thomas) and daughter of Mabel (Mabel King), and she became known for her catch phrase, \u201cOoooh, I\u2019m gonna tell Mama!\u201d Nelson portrayed the down-to-earth Dwayne on the show.\nShe reprised the role for the sequel What\u2019s Happening Now!, which aired for another three seasons starting in 1985.\nSpencer went on to became a veterinarian in 1993, and James L. Brooks hired her to play one in his 1997 film, As Good as It Gets. \u201cShe had a great love of animals, she was like Betty White in that way,\u201d Nelson said.\nBorn on June 24, 1965, and raised in New York City by her mother, Cheryl, a French teacher, and stepfather, actor Tim Pelt, Danielle Luise Spencer started acting at age 7 in a repertory company co-founded by Pelt.\nShe had uncredited bit parts in such films as Serpico (1973) and Harry and Tonto (1974) before landing the role in What\u2019s Happening!! when she was 11, bringing her and her family to California.\n\u201cI had never seen any young black girl in that type of spotlight, so I didn\u2019t have a reference point in the media as to how to deal with this opportunity,\u201d she told Jet magazine in 2014. \u201cI was from the Bronx. What I did was use my own family as the reference on how to portray my character.\u201d\nIn September 1977, Spencer was involved in a five-car accident on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu that killed her stepfather, who was driving, and left her in intensive care for several weeks. He had taken her to see Star Wars at the drive-in the previous evening.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even get a chance to say goodbye to my stepfather, Daddy Tim, whom I loved and who taught me show business as a young child in New York,\u201d Spencer wrote in her 2010 memoir, Through the Fire \u2026 Journal of a Child Star.\nAfter What\u2019s Happening!! was canceled, Spencer and her family moved to the Ivory Coast. She then attended UC Davis, UCLA and then veterinary school at Tuskegee University, earning a doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1993.\nA decade later, Spencer developed a spinal condition \u2014 perhaps caused by her auto accident \u2014 that left her paralyzed from the waist down for months.\nSpencer worked as a veterinarian for two decades in the Los Angeles area before relocating in 2014 to Richmond, where she did a regular morning segment about pet care for CBS affiliate WTVR-TV.\nIn 2014, she was inducted into the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture.\nIn addition to her mother, survivors include her brother, Jeremy, a jazz musician.\nIn a 2016 interview with Hers magazine, Spencer said it was important to do \u201cwhat it is that you think is going to make you happy.\u201d\n\u201cYou really have to live life for you at that minute,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just try to have fun. Be lighthearted and be happy while you\u2019re here, because you never know when that time is going to end.\u201d\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"
