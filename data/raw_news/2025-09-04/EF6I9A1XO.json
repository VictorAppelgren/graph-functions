  "content": "Protesters pass the local parliament building as it is engulfed in flames in South Sulawesi, Indonesia.\n\nProtests in Indonesia sparked by economic hardship have elicited a heavy-handed response from police, triggering concerns that the Southeast Asian nation could be returning to its authoritarian past.\n\nAs police trucks have been spray-painted with anti-law enforcement slogans, President Prabowo Subianto has denounced the demonstrations as \u201ctreason and terrorism\u201d while seeking to assuage wide-ranging discontent.\n\nThousands have taken to the streets in major cities in the last week, joined at times by rioters setting fire to government buildings and looters ransacking the homes of politicians. At least 10 people have died and hundreds have been injured in the ensuing unrest.\n\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of student unions met with lawmakers and demanded an independent investigation into the police violence, portending further protests.\n\nFrustrations in the world\u2019s third-largest democracy have been building since Prabowo, a former military general and businessman, took power last year, implementing austerity measures that have cut billions from public services such as healthcare and education.\n\nMany ordinary Indonesians criticize the government for primarily serving the interests of the wealthy elite even as youth unemployment soars and wages stagnate.\n\nThe initial wave of demonstrations began Aug. 25, with thousands gathering outside the country\u2019s parliament to decry one stark example of such inequality: a $3,000 housing allowance for lawmakers that was nearly 10 times the minimum wage in Jakarta.\n\nThe discontent escalated into violence when a 21-year-old motorcycle taxi driver was fatally struck by an armored police vehicle speeding through the crowd.\n\nPrabowo and his police chief have apologized for the incident, and one of the officers involved in the crash has been fired.\n\nAt a televised news conference, Prabowo stressed that the right to peaceful assembly should be protected but that \u201cthe state must step in to protect its citizens.\u201d\n\nNeither these measures, nor the president\u2019s promise to scale back the lawmakers\u2019 perks, have quelled the outpouring of public anger, which has been met with a police response that human rights groups have decried as excessive.\n\n\u201cNobody should die while exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,\u201d said Montse Ferrer, Amnesty International\u2019s regional research director for East and Southeast Asia.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations called for an investigation into the \u201calleged use of unnecessary or disproportionate force by security forces.\u201d\n\nSince the demonstrations began, Indonesian police have used tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets against protesters, some of whom have lobbed back Molotov cocktails and rocks. Authorities have arrested over 3,000 people.\n\nTwo deaths have been attributed to the police crackdown: a pedicab driver in the city of Solo who died last week while being treated for tear gas exposure, and a college student who died Sunday after apparently being beaten by police.\n\nSuch incidents have resurfaced the Indonesian public\u2019s festering distrust of the police force, said Jacqui Baker, a scholar of Indonesian security and policing at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia.\n\n\u201cOrdinary people have long repeated a saying \u2018report a chicken, lose a buffalo,\u2019 meaning if you engage the police in routine law enforcement ... you are likely to suffer more material loss than the original theft,\u201d she said.\n\nIn recent years, civic groups have accused police of dozens of extrajudicial killings and torture.\n\nMany of the country\u2019s policing problems stem from a three-decade-long period of authoritarian rule under then-President Suharto that ended in 1998.\n\nWith the police remaining wedded to political interests even after the country\u2019s democratization, Baker said, the \u201chistorical sense of entitlement has generated a deeply corrupt, violent and predatory force that is widely hated by ordinary people.\u201d\n\nPresident Prabowo himself is accused of human rights abuses, such as the abduction of dissidents, under Suharto\u2019s rule. Critics say he is now pulling the country back into authoritarianism by expanding the military\u2019s involvement in civilian institutions. Prabowo denies these claims.",

Dozens of protesters were seen running with stolen goods including furniture and gallons of cooking oil.\nEgbetokun, the police chief, said officers \u201caimed at ensuring peaceful conduct.\u201d But, he added, \u201cregrettably, events in some major cities today showed that what was being instigated was mass uprising and looting, not protest.\u201d\nThe police chief\u2019s claim was disputed by rights groups and activists.\n\u201cOur findings so far show that security personnel at the locations where lives were lost deliberately used tactics designed to kill,\u201d Sanusi said.\nOn Wednesday night, another bomb that exploded at a roadside market in Borno state killed at least 16 people, police said.\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility, but analysts suspected the Islamic militant group Boko Haram, which has since 2009 waged an insurgency in Nigeria and neighboring countries in the Lake Chad region.\nBoko Haram and its splinter group the Islamic State West Africa Province have contributed to a humanitarian disaster in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad, with more than 35,000 people killed and 2.6 million others displaced over the last 15 years.\nThe groups want to install an Islamic state across the four countries but mainly in Nigeria, whose more than 200 million people are divided almost equally between a mainly Christian south and a predominantly Muslim north.\nThe Nigerian government has claimed progress against the insurgency, but Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have expanded into other regions, including central Nigeria, where the capital, Abuja, is located, according to experts and public records on counterterrorism.\nAsadu writes for the Associated Press.

At least two police stations were razed by angry protesters.\nKenyans demonstrated Wednesday in 23 of 47 counties across the country calling for an end to police brutality and better governance. Thousands chanted anti-government slogans, and the protests morphed to calls for President William Ruto to resign.\nMany protesters were enraged by the recent death of a blogger in custody and the shooting of a civilian during protests over the blogger\u2019s death.\nThe country\u2019s Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen on Thursday assessed damage to businesses in the capital, Nairobi, where goods were stolen from multiple stores. He said police would follow up with owners whose CCTV cameras captured the thieves to ensure swift arrests.\nAt least two families have identified their deceased kin at the Nairobi mortuary. One relative, Fatma Opango, told local media that her 17-year-old nephew was gunned down in Rongai area in the outskirts of Nairobi.\n\u201cI came across his photo in a group online and I started searching for him at the hospitals hoping he had survived,\u201d she told journalists at the mortuary.\nMurkomen on Thursday defended the conduct of police officers during the protests, saying the \u201cgovernment has your back.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no police officer who committed any excess yesterday, they foiled a coup and they deserve our defense,\u201d Murkomen said, adding that police \u201cdon\u2019t carry guns as toys.\u201d\nIn downtown Nairobi, businesspeople counted their losses after looters raided their shops and set some shops on fire.\nIn one of the buildings where smoke was still billowing Thursday morning, a phone seller told journalists that she lost stock worth $6,000.\nKenyans mobilized Wednesday\u2019s protests on social media platforms to mark the one-year anniversary of huge anti-tax protests, when demonstrators stormed parliament and at least 60 people were killed. Twenty others are still missing.\nParliament and the president\u2019s office were on Wednesday barricaded with razor wire and protesters were unable to use the roads leading to the two establishments.\nMusambi writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "Police use force to break up protests at a university in Turkey\u2019s capital\n- Share via\nISTANBUL \u2014 Police used pepper spray, plastic pellets and water cannon against protesters in Turkey\u2019s capital early Thursday, the latest clash in the country\u2019s biggest antigovernment protests in over a decade.\nThe demonstrations began last week following the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Imamoglu was jailed pending trial on corruption charges many see as politically motivated and is also accused of supporting terrorism. The government insists the judiciary is independent, but critics say the evidence is based on secret witnesses and lacks credibility.\nEarly Thursday, student demonstrators tried to march and gathered to read a statement near the gates at Middle East Technical University, pro-opposition broadcaster Halk TV and local media reported. They were met by security forces who deployed pepper spray, water cannon and plastic pellets. A standoff ensued where the students hid behind a barricade of dumpsters until the police charged to detain them.\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said prosecutors issued warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people.\nMelih Meric, a legislator with Imamoglu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party or CHP, was seen soaked with water and suffering from pepper spray exposure.\n\u201cMy student friends only wanted to make a press statement, but the police strictly did not allow it, this is the result,\u201d Meric said in social media videos.\nNearly 1,900 arrested\nInterior Minister Ali Yerkikaya said Thursday that nearly 1,900 people have been arrested over eight days of massive protests across the country. He said that 1,879 suspects were detained, including 260 who were jailed pending trial. A further 468 were released under judicial control while their cases continue. Proceedings are ongoing for 662 other people.\nThe minister said some faced charges for drug offenses and assault, adding that 150 police officers had been injured. He did not specify the nature of other charges but offenses such as resisting police and not complying with a ban on protests and gatherings have been cited previously.\nDemonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of largely peaceful protesters have swept across major cities, including opposition-organized rallies outside Istanbul City Hall. Other major protests have been held in Istanbul\u2019s districts of Kadikoy and Sisli districts in recent days.\nA media workers\u2019 union says Turkish authorities have detained several journalists from their homes.\nSome demonstrations have been marred by violence as police used water cannons, tear gas, plastic pellets and pepper spray to break up protests that have been banned in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.\nPolice continued to carry out house raids targeting protesters Thursday morning. Most of those detained in their homes appear to belong to left-wing parties, trade unions and civil society groups.\nEleven journalists were arrested and sent to jail Wednesday after covering the protests. At least eight were released under judicial control a day later, the Media and Law Studies Assn. said, but still face charges relating to the protests.\nTurkey\u2019s broadcasting authority, meanwhile, issued a 10-day airwave ban on opposition-supported channel Sozcu TV, the station said. The penalty was issued for \u201cinciting the public to hatred and hostility\u201d during broadcasts leading up to Imamoglu\u2019s imprisonment.\nRadio and Television Supreme Council member Ilhan Tasci said that other channels backing the opposition were fined and handed program suspensions over their protest coverage.\nThe arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu has intensified political tensions, triggering Turkey\u2019s largest wave of protests in more than a decade.\nBBC reporter Mark Lowen was deported from Turkey following his arrest Wednesday, the British news broadcaster said. He was detained at his hotel and held for 17 hours before being issued a notice describing him as a \u201cthreat to public order,\u201d according to a BBC statement Thursday.\nMayor and more than 100 others pending trial\nImamoglu, the Istanbul mayor, was detained in a dawn raid on his home last Wednesday and later remanded to prison. He faces charges stemming from two investigations into the opposition-controlled Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality \u2014 a corruption case and one alleging support for terrorism.\nThe mayor is the main challenger to Erdogan in an election currently scheduled for 2028 but which is likely to take place earlier.\nJustice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said Thursday that 106 people had been arrested in both municipality investigations, with 51 in jail pending trial, including Imamoglu. Those detained include municipal officials and business figures accused of crimes such as bribery, extortion and bid-rigging.\nMany see the case against Imamoglu as politically motivated. Protesters often say they have come out against Turkey\u2019s democratic backsliding and increasing authoritarianism, as well as the country\u2019s bleak economic outlook.\nImamoglu was confirmed as the CHP candidate for presidential elections the same day he was sent to prison He has performed well in recent polls against Erdogan, and his election as mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in 2019 was a major blow to the president.\nBadendieck and Wilks write for the Associated Press."
