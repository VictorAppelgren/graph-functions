      "summary": "European governments are increasing military budgets, which is lifting demand for industrial metals—particularly copper, nickel, and steel—by up to 6% by 2027. Defense spending already accounts for about 3% of global industrial metals demand, and the boost is expected to raise global copper demand growth from 2% to 2.4% annually. The surge has propelled defense stocks, with the MSCI Europe Aerospace and Defense Index up 72% YTD, and could push copper prices toward $10,000–$10,750 per metric ton in 2026–2027, though high inventories may temper near‑term gains.",
