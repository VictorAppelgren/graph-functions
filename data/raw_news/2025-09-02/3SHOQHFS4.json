  "content": "Russia and China have signed a legally binding memorandum for the construction of a new gas pipeline through Mongolia to China, Gazprom chief Alexei Miller announced in Beijing on Tuesday, according to Russian news agencies.\n\nThe price of gas supplied via the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline would be lower than for Europe, Miller noted, pointing to reduced transport costs.\n\nGazprom and the China National Petroleum Corporation also signed documents to boost gas deliveries through the existing Power of Siberia pipeline from 38 billion cubic metres per year to 44 billion cubic metres, according to the reports.\n\nThe 6,700-kilometre-long Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, including 2,700 kilometres on Russian soil, is due to have a capacity of 50 billion cubic metres per year. The contract is set for 30 years, according to the Russian reports.\n\nMiller described the pipeline as the \"largest, most extensive and capital-intensive gas project worldwide,\" without giving details on the costs.\n\nEstimates suggest it will cost tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe announcement follows a meeting of Russian President Vladimir Putin with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Kh\u00fcrels\u00fckh in Beijing.\n\nThe timeline for the construction of the new pipeline remains unclear. Negotiations on the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline have been ongoing for five years, with Moscow and Beijing unable to agree on the price.\n\nHaving largely lost the European oil and gas market following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has been pressured by China to offer hefty discounts, with media reporting that Beijing wanted to pay domestic Russian gas prices.\n\nHowever, according to the Wall Street Journal, the recent conflict between Israel and Iran, including US attacks on Iran, has reignited Chinese interest in the project, due to concerns about supply security from the Middle East.",

The new line will deliver gas to China at lower transport costs than the existing Power of Siberia route, which will see deliveries rise from 38\u202fbillion to 44\u202fbillion cubic metres annually. The project, described by Gazprom as the world\u2019s largest gas pipeline, is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars, but construction timelines remain unclear. The deal follows heightened Chinese interest amid Middle East supply concerns and Russia\u2019s need to diversify after losing European gas markets.",
