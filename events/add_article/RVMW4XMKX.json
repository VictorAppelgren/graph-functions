      "summary": "The article discusses the importance of financial literacy and household balance sheets, highlighting how skills learned in home economics can impact financial management. It notes that the median net worth of U.S. households is around $190,000, but significant disparities exist, particularly among lower income quintiles.

The piece emphasizes that while digital literacy is important, financial literacy is crucial for enhancing household financial security.",
