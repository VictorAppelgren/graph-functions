  "description": "Oasis are bringing their reunion tour to Dublin's Croke Park on Saturday 16 and Sunday 17 August.",
  "content": "Oasis in Dublin: Croke Park, tickets and everything you need to know\n\nIt's the most anticipated tour of the year - or, for those who came of age during the Britpop days of the 90s, the decade. Oasis are back for their first gigs on Irish soil since 2008, with the Oasis Live '25 reunion tour arriving in Dublin for two sold out performances at Croke Park on Saturday 16 and Sunday 17 August. Tickets for all UK and Ireland dates sold out in less than a day after brothers, and band leaders, Liam and Noel Gallagher announced the reunion in 27 August last year. If you're planning to make your way to Dublin's Croke Park for two nights of being a Rock 'N' Roll Star, then do we have everything you need to know right here? Definitely Maybe.\n\nWhere are Oasis playing in Dublin?\n\nCroke Park, the island of Ireland's largest stadium and the home of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), will be the venue for Oasis' Irish shows. The ground has a capacity of more than 80,000, meaning more than 160,000 people could see Oasis over the two nights (although some may have been lucky enough to snag tickets for both shows).\n\nCan I still get tickets to Oasis?\n\nThe big question for many - but Oasis' UK and Ireland dates have been sold out across all venues in the face of huge demand. However, there is still hope - limited tickets can be bought from the official Ticketmaster resale site, where fans who can no longer go sell their seats. However the tickets can come and go quickly.\n\nWhen does the concert get underway?\n\nDoors open at 17:00 BST, with strictly no camping or queueing allowed outside Croke Park (more on that below). With several entry ways into the stadium, it is important to know which colour gate you enter through, which can be found on your ticket information. Support acts are expected to begin at 18:00 BST. Oasis have typically been starting their two-hour set about 20:15 BST. The concert is expected to end about 22:30 BST.\n\nWhat will security be like at Oasis?\n\nConcert promotor MCD have said patrons are advised to allow sufficient time to travel to the event and pass through security checks. No camping of queueing is allowed at the venue ahead of time - if you do turn up early, you will be turned away at restricted area points around Croke Park. MCD say this is to avoid disruption to residents of the area's around the venue. Strict security checks will be in operation, with everyone subject to be searched as a condition of entry. Searches can also take place once inside the venue, MCD said. There are strictly no camping/collapsible chairs permitted on site and gig goers are especially advised not to bring large bags or backpacks as they may experience delays or refused entry. There will be no storage facilities on site. And a final word - there are no re-admissions to the concert. If you leave, you won't get back in.\n\nWho are supporting Oasis in Dublin?\n\nThe band have had two support acts throughout the tour - and both are big names from Britpop's heyday. Richard Ashcroft, former frontman of 90s rock band The Verve, will play before Oasis take the stage. Ashcroft has a long association with the Gallagher brothers and one of the band's most beloved songs - Cast No Shadow from 1995's (What's the Story) Morning Glory - was written about him. The Liverpudlian indie rock band Cast are also performing, opening the show. Similar to the Gallagher brothers, Cast frontman John Power has an Irish connection from his Wexford-born father. Last year Power received his an Irish passport. Oasis will also be augmented by a brass section, and backing singer Jess Greenfield, who is part of Noel's side project the High Flying Birds.\n\nHow do I get to Croke Park?\n\nWhat's the weather going to be like for Oasis in Dublin?\n\nLiam and Noel Gallagher's parents, Peggy and Thomas, are both Irish and emigrated to England. Peggy left Charlestown, County Mayo in 1961 at age 18, originally working as a housekeeper in Manchester. It was in Manchester where she met Thomas Gallagher, who hailed from the County Meath village of Duleek. Speaking to the Irish Mail on Sunday in June, Peggy, 82, said she was hoping to attend one of the Croke Park shows even if she has to \"hobble around\" after having knee replacement surgery earlier this year.",

      "text": "Plan to ban dynamic ticket pricing after Oasis sale\n- Published\nA number of Fianna F\u00e1il senators and TDs (Irish MPs) are seeking to introduce legislation in the Republic of Ireland that would ban a process known as 'dynamic pricing' following price increases for Oasis gigs in Dublin.\nThere has been widespread criticism of dynamic pricing over the past week.\nDynamic pricing meant that on Ticketmaster, where tickets to the reunion tour were originally sold, prices rose in line with demand.\nThe cost of some standing tickets at Croke Park in Dublin rose from \u20ac176 (\u00a3148) on pre-sale to more than \u20ac400 (\u00a3337).\nTicketmaster has defended the way it sells tickets.\nLast week, Oasis announced two concerts at Croke Park on 16 and 17 August, along with a further 15 other nights at venues in the UK.\nTwo more gigs have since been announced for Wembley in London.\nMove to ban practice\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Act came into effect in 2021 and banned the reselling of tickets above face value.\nOn Thursday, Fianna F\u00e1il Senator Timmy Dooley, Niamh Smyth TD (MP) and Jim O\u2019Callaghan TD will introduce an amendment to that bill.\nMr O\u2019Callaghan said: \u201cThe 2021 Act protected fans from the experience of missing out on tickets and seeing those same tickets for sale on a secondary site for far more than they can afford or would be happy to pay.\n\u201cIt now must be extended so we can protect fans from the experience of seeing \u2018in demand\u2019 tickets jumping significantly above the asking price that was initially advertised.\u201d\nThe UK government has already said there will be a review looking at the transparency and use of dynamic pricing, including the technology around queuing systems which incentivise it.\nSchellion Horn, competition economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that dynamic pricing was about setting the price around supply and demand.\nThat means as demand for tickets goes up, then the price rises to match that.\n'Must be nipped in the bud'\nSenator Timmy Dooley said: \u201cThis is about protecting consumers from being ripped off by technological practices.\n\"People attending any event, not just concerts, should be confident that when they are waiting in an online queue to purchase a ticket they will pay the price that was initially advertised.\n\u201cOver the weekend, this was not the case for fans of Oasis. After waiting in an online queue fans were met by \u2018in demand\u2019 tickets that were for sale at over \u20ac400 each.\u201d\nMr Dooley said the practice of dynamic pricing \u201cmust be nipped in the bud before it becomes common practice\u201d.\nHe added that fans \u201cdeserve fairness and transparency\u201d.\nWhat is dynamic pricing?\nDynamic pricing is when a charge varies according to market demand, rather than having a fixed cost.\nTicketmaster has said it does not set prices and that it is down to the \"event organiser\" who \"has priced these tickets according to their market value\".\nT\u00e1naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin has said there is a role for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to investigate the pricing of the Oasis gig tickets.\nIn a statement, the CCPC said that under consumer law in Ireland, people should be clearly informed of the full price of a product, including fees, before they buy.\nOasis hit out at Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing this week.\nIn a statement issued to PA Media, the band said: \"It needs to be made clear that Oasis leave decisions on ticketing and pricing entirely to their promoters and management.\"\nThey added they had \"at no time had any awareness that dynamic pricing was going to be used\" in the sale of tickets for the initial dates.\nOasis said tickets for the new Wembley dates would be handed out via a \"staggered, invitation-only ballot process\".\nWill this proposal become law?\nThe bill will now be brought to the Seanad for debate before being debated in the D\u00e1il. It will then be voted on.\nOnly when both Houses have passed a bill can President Michael D Higgins sign it into law.\nThe bill is being introduced as a Private Members' Bill (PMB).\nFine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party are currently in a coalition government.\nA spokesperson for the Green Party in the Republic of Ireland has said that as the bill is a PMB, it will have to be discussed at Cabinet before a decision will be made on whether or not to support it.\n'It's pure greed'\nGreen Party Councillor for Lisnasharragh Brian Smyth tried to get tickets for one of the Oasis gigs at Croke Park.\nThe only tickets available when he got through the online queue were platinum tickets or packages. The platinum ticket on offer started at \u20ac353.50 (\u00a3297.96) and the fan packages started at \u20ac420.25 (\u00a3354.19) and went as high as more than \u20ac500.\nGiven the high ticket prices, he made the decision not to purchase one.\nAllow X content?\nThis article contains content provided by X.
