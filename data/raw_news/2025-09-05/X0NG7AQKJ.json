  "title": "Reclaiming the stack: Europe\u2019s bid for digital sovereignty",
  "description": "Gustaf Sahlman, CEO of Swedish ID management firm Curity, argues Europe must reclaim its tech stack to secure digital sovereignty.",
  "content": "The entanglement of tech and politics has become impossible to ignore \u2014 especially in the United States, where the lines between Silicon Valley and Washington are rapidly dissolving.\n\nAt President Trump\u2019s inauguration, the CEOs of Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet took prominent seats \u2014 even ahead of cabinet nominees \u2014 an unmistakable sign of how closely US tech giants are now intertwined with national policy agendas. Just days earlier, outgoing President Biden had warned of a rising \u201ctech industrial complex.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t just symbolism. It reflects a broader shift: US tech firms are aligning themselves with a domestic industrial strategy that treats cloud, AI, and digital infrastructure as tools of geopolitical power. For Europe, the implications are becoming harder to ignore.\n\nFrance\u2019s AI and digital minister has since warned of digital \u201cpredators\u201d undermining European autonomy. In Germany, government agencies have started phasing out Microsoft Teams in favour of domestic collaboration tools. And in Denmark, a nationwide migration to open-source Linux systems is underway.\n\nThese are not isolated incidents. They signal the early stages of a digital sovereignty movement \u2014 one driven as much by pragmatism as by politics. For Europe, reclaiming control over digital infrastructure is no longer a fringe idea. It\u2019s a strategic imperative.\n\nEurope\u2019s dependency on foreign hyperscalers is deep and longstanding. The majority of government services, healthcare systems, and private sector infrastructure run on platforms controlled by Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google. This reliance has become so entrenched that it has long gone unnoticed \u2014 until now.\n\nConsider the US CLOUD Act, which gives American authorities the right to access data stored on US-owned servers, even if that data resides in Europe. For EU citizens and enterprises, this creates a fundamental contradiction: their data is simultaneously subject to local privacy laws like the GDPR, and to foreign surveillance laws they cannot influence.\n\nVendor lock-in compounds the problem. Many organisations find themselves tied to proprietary ecosystems with limited portability, unable to move or replicate workloads across providers without significant cost or risk. Worse still, operational decisions, such as product changes, pricing, or data handling practices, are increasingly made without European input.\n\nCloud infrastructure has become critical infrastructure. The question is no longer whether it matters who controls it, but what happens when those controls sit thousands of miles away, in different jurisdictions with different interests.\n\nEuropean governments are beginning to act. France has launched substantial investments in domestic cloud initiatives, supporting providers like OVHcloud and investing in sovereign platforms that have \u201cSecNumCloud\u201d certification. Germany, meanwhile, has taken steps to reduce its reliance on non-European providers across federal agencies. In the case of Denmark, the shift to Linux isn\u2019t just about cost-saving. It\u2019s about control, transparency, and security \u2014 hardly surprising considering Trump\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in Greenland.\n\nThese moves are not reactive or symbolic. They are part of a broader shift toward digital self-determination \u2014 one that recognises sovereignty as a foundation for resilience. For too long, Europe\u2019s digital future has been outsourced. Now, there is a growing realisation that true independence requires owning the stack \u2014 from infrastructure and identity to data and application logic.\n\nThis movement is not about anti-American sentiment. Nor is it an argument for economic protectionism. European digital sovereignty is not a rejection of global collaboration \u2014 it\u2019s a recalibration of risk.\n\nGovernments and enterprises alike are waking up to the reality that resilience cannot be achieved through over-reliance on a narrow set of providers. When infrastructure is dominated by a handful of foreign vendors, the system becomes brittle, not strong.\n\nEurope should move towards a more robust approach defined by:\n\n\n\nFor identity and access management in particular, open protocols like OAuth and OpenID Connect enable multi-cloud orchestration. This means that if an organisation needs to switch providers or host in a new region, their identity layer can remain consistent and secure \u2014 a crucial capability in an era of geopolitical turbulence and accelerating cyber threats.\n\nThe path to digital sovereignty does not require a revolution. But it does demand focus and follow-through.\n\nA practical approach begins with auditing existing digital dependencies \u2014 not just at the infrastructure level, but across the full digital stack. From there, organisations should identify where resilience and portability are weakest, and where they are most exposed to external decisions beyond their control.\n\nThis assessment should inform a phased diversification strategy. That might mean gradually shifting workloads to sovereign clouds, adopting open-source alternatives to proprietary software, or decoupling key components \u2014 such as authentication or API management \u2014 from single-vendor ecosystems.\n\nGovernments have a role to play, not only in policy and procurement, but in investing in skills and local innovation ecosystems. Sovereignty is not a checklist item \u2014 it is a capability that requires sustained support to build and maintain.\n\nIn a world where digital systems underpin every aspect of life, from education and healthcare to finance and national defence, infrastructure control is no longer a technical issue. It is a matter of strategic independence.\n\nEurope has a choice to make. Continue relying on foreign platforms for its most sensitive digital functions, or invest in a future it can truly own.\n\nSovereignty is not about isolation. It\u2019s about agency \u2014 the power to shape a digital future that reflects European values, laws, and long-term interests.",

      "text": "When the modern-day internet began emerging in the early 2000s, finding hosting services and resources to run the new wave of dynamic web applications was hard. You needed a database to store application data. These were slow, expensive, and unreliable, regularly bringing applications to a grinding halt when a single instance failed. You needed a server to run interpreted languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby. These were equally expensive, often needed configuration, had security issues, and frequently ran out of memory or CPU resources, again bringing applications to a grinding halt.\nFor anyone on a small budget, running web 2.0-era applications required constant configuration tweaking, tight performance streamlining, and cost reduction, all within the typically tight confines of what a provider would even let you change and manage yourself.\nBetween those heady days and now, an increasing patchwork of hosting providers emerged to cope with the complexity and scale that web applications demanded.\nFor the past 10 years, a significant proportion of applications have moved to a new generation called \u201ccloud hosting\u201d. The term \u201ccloud\u201d is a bit vague, and there\u2019s a popular (but not altogether accurate) phrase that says, \u201cThe cloud is just someone else\u2019s computer\u201d. The cloud abstracts and simplifies the complexity of managing the infrastructure mentioned above. Instead of thinking about servers, you think of services and instances of services.\nIn the modern infrastructure world, when a database is struggling, you add another instance. If you have so many database and application instances that you\u2019ve lost track of what\u2019s happening, add another service or three for that, too.\nTaking this abstraction to an extreme, \u201cserverless\u201d has reached its peak popularity in the past few years. This approach aims to reduce servers and services to something more like a function call. Of course, a server still handles all these function calls and responses behind the scenes, but the argument is that you shouldn\u2019t need to worry about that and should only focus on sending and receiving data.\nMore than 20 years later, web-based application developers\u2019 lives are surely easier, aren\u2019t they?\nNo, not really. There are many issues with developing and maintaining apps that run in the cloud. Thankfully, several European operators are trying to make developers\u2019 lives easier again.\nBefore getting to them, here\u2019s a quick terminology guide.\n- Private cloud: Services used by only one customer.\n- Public cloud: Services shared by more than one customer.\nIn both cases, customer data and details remain private, and everything could run in one or more locations. The main difference is that the provider carves out a digital tranche of territory just for that customer. This is probably defined in software, but it could be in hardware, and it could be a dedicated server running remotely or locally to the customer.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s dig into the problems in the cloud computing world.\nThe cloud is consolidated and monopolised\nCloud computing has hundreds of providers, yet most people only think of three: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) \u2014 known as the \u201chyperscalers\u201d of the hosting industry.\nThe web is a big place, brimming with publicly and privately available sites, so precise numbers of what runs where are hard to come by. However, according to statistics from builtwith.com, about 12% of websites \u2014 approximately 86.8 million in total \u2014 run on AWS. The other two \u201conly\u201d host roughly another 12% combined. If you look at hosting companies that call themselves \u201ccloud\u201d, then according to techjury.net these percentages increase to 32% for AWS, 23% for Azure, and 10% for GCP.\nYet with these statistics, defining what constitutes a website is complicated. Hyperscalers offer hundreds of different services that developers use for one or more parts of an application, some of which perform crucial functions that break an application if unavailable.\nThis has caused problems in the past. Remember the various times when large amounts of online services were unavailable? That was probably due to one of these major companies experiencing an outage. This has led to many developers taking a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud approach with their applications, spreading risk by hosting services across multiple providers. This solves a technical issue but brings more revenue to all cloud providers and increases complexity.\nThis consolidation puts a tremendous amount of power into a handful of companies. If they change their policies, thousands of businesses could be left without a place to run. More concerning is that all of the top three \u2014 in fact, all of the top five \u2014 are US companies, except for Alibaba, based in China.\nThe US already has data privacy, security, and law enforcement policies that concern many companies and jurisdictions, and while all the companies mentioned provide hosting options in a global variety of jurisdictions, what if politics in the US no longer respected these digital borders? No matter how unlikely some things can seem, consolidation is always dangerous.\nDiversifying the cloud\nDevelopers and their companies do not want to completely switch away from the cloud. Rather, they are looking for new options from the hyperscale hosts, especially in Europe, where there is a mixture of increased regulations and insecurity around using American services, alongside a degree of nationalism encouraging people to use European services.\nThese trends create new global opportunities for alternative hosting providers, new and old, especially in Europe.\nI spoke to three of the largest hosting providers in Europe to find out if they are noticing the same trends and what they think the next 20 years of web hosting might look like. Two of them \u2014 France\u2019s OVH (the host of around 4% of websites) and Germany\u2019s Hetzner (around 5.5% of websites) \u2014 have existed since the late 1990s, before the web 2.0 revolution and \u201ccloud\u201d was a term. The third is the UK\u2019s Civo, which is just seven years old, but has founders with many more years of experience helping companies bring their applications to the internet.\nThe cloud hasn\u2019t lived up to its promise\nAs developers rushed to the cloud, it promised to make developing and running large, complex applications easier and more cost-effective. Anyone who has sat back to look at the myriad tools and processes they now have to use and maintain for a cloud-native application might wonder how true that is. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape map has become so large that other tools and working groups are needed to help people navigate it.\nWhile the hosts of yesteryear would charge a reliable and steady amount per month, hyperscale cloud companies tend to charge by usage, which leads to unpredictable and spiky costs that are often hard to interpret and act upon. A recent report from cloudzero states that more than 20% of respondents have no clear idea of their cloud costs, which can consist of thousands of rows of data. A report from IT support firm AAG found that 82% of respondents find cloud spending challenging.\nThe European difference\nOVH, Hetzner, and Civo all said the interaction points to the hyperscalers have become overly complex, with too many layers of abstractions needed to get started. People are now accustomed to more user-friendly interfaces. If AWS arrived today with its byzantine UI, the service might struggle to attract as many users.\nFor Europe\u2019s cloud competitors, this presents an opportunity. \u201cWith everything we do, we put ourselves in the shoes of a user,\u201d said Dinesh Majrekar, CTO of Civo. \u201cBy using sensible defaults and clear cost indications, we aim to make it possible to scroll to the bottom of any form and create what you need.\u201d\nHetzner\u2019s approach is similar. As their spokesperson, Christian Fitz, told me, \u201cWe offer a straightforward user interface and an easy setup process, ideal for users who need cost-effective servers without complex administration.\u201d\nCost efficiency\nOne of the biggest motivations in the current climate is cutting costs. The move to the cloud promised to save users money, or at the least, ensure they only spend money on resources when needed, rather than pay for idle machines. However, as the AAG report mentioned earlier shows, companies are now paying more than ever for running services. Granted, actual usage is likely also increased. For many, the issue is the inconsistent monthly bills and the lack of transparency in the relationship between services, usage, and costs.\nIn recognition of how big this disconnect is, there\u2019s now an entire foundation, the FinOps foundation, dedicated to maximising the business value of the cloud, and OpenCost, an open-source tool that helps show the cost of infrastructure decisions, was recently welcomed into the CNCF.\nAround the time of KubeCon EU 2024, Broadcom had recently acquired VMWare and announced significant pricing changes. VMWare had been a popular option for running a private cloud, and while Broadcom rolled back some of the pricing changes, the experience caused many to look for more open and standards-based options for private cloud hosting. All three hosts emphasised the importance of allowing customers to switch between providers. The most controversial of these policies is charging for egress, i.e. the cost of moving data from a cloud service, which can make multi-cloud hosting prohibitively expensive.\nOVH has pledged not to apply these charges. Yaniv Fdida, the company\u2019s Chief Product and Technology Officer, said, \u201cWe have no fees on egress or traffic in and out. The cloud should be free. This enables our customers to balance workloads and have free choice. This is part of our tagline, and as far as tools are concerned, we use open standards.\u201d\nThis is a growing trend amongst providers. As Majrekar notes, \u201cWe recently got rid of egress charges altogether. So that\u2019s something you don\u2019t have to worry about.\u201d\nA trustworthy cloud\nPerhaps due to anxieties about keeping valuable data in other territories, national pride, or regulatory reasons, European companies often look to alternatives to the hyperscale hosts.\nFor OVH, that provides a chance to offer a more trustworthy service.\nAs an older company, OVH runs its own data centres but also produces a lot of its own hardware in locations in Europe and North America. The hyperscalers make a lot of their own hardware too, but the only hosts I could find that make hardware in Europe are OVH and Hetzner. This creates what OVH calls the \u201ctrusted cloud\u201d, where they can guarantee higher data sovereignty thanks to knowledge of the supply chain behind the hardware that processes customer data.\nThis doesn\u2019t just lead to increased trust but also, as Fdida put it, an increased ability to innovate.\n\u201cBecause we are not tied to any third-party suppliers, we can really accelerate our time to market and our durability and longevity,\u201d he said.\nA less wasteful cloud\nWhile the hyperscale hosts rush to open power plants to meet the high energy demands for generative AI applications, smaller hosts are taking different approaches. Sustainability is one area where European providers (and global providers\u2019 European operations) excel and have the potential to lead the world as other regions start to pull back from sustainability commitments.\nHetzner has made the issue a key selling point. As Fitz, their spokesperson, told me, \u201cOur commitment to environmentally friendly hosting spans many years; in Germany, we power our data centres exclusively with hydropower, and in Finland, we also use wind power. Hosting that aligns with sustainability goals is becoming increasingly important. \u201c\nCivo, meanwhile, partners with the UK\u2019s Deep Green to run graphical processing units (GPUs) that many AI-heavy processes use. Deep Green uses multiple methods to reuse the heat that servers generate. For example, the company submerges servers in a special liquid, heating that water and using it for other purposes. While Deep Green already has 1,500 sites around the UK, it\u2019s unclear how many of these are used by Civo.\nDeep Green and Civo aren\u2019t the only partners trying this idea in Europe. Swiss host Infomaniak does something similar. These projects are a great example of how Europe\u2019s typically denser cities can use colocation.\nOne aspect of making sustainable data centres that is often missed is the embedded carbon in buying and decommissioning servers. OVH has addressed this by recycling and reusing much of its hardware, keeping older machines running for less intensive use cases.\nThe future of the cloud\nLooking back over nearly 30 years of web hosting, you can see many changes in demands, requirements, and ways the industry handles them. If the sudden surge in demand for new AI tools is anything to judge by, it\u2019s hard to make predictions.\nFdida thinks the next challenge for providers will be quantum computing.\n\u201c Quantum will drastically change the way we look at workloads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a pioneer in Europe and have been delivering simulators of quantum computing in our cloud for the last two years. And we have a real one hosted in our facilities with a company. We believe that it takes time to materialise how quantum can disrupt completely because it\u2019s a new paradigm of looking at computing, right?\u201d\nAnother issue for the future will be complexity. Mark Boost of Civo hopes that moving forward will also mean a return to simpler times.\n\u201cBefore the cloud, you had hosting companies, you had FTP, and you could just move between providers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAmazon pretty much defined this new market in the early days and has created this world of complexity, which means that freedom of movement is so difficult. I\u2019d love to see us get to that place, and I think the future will be that.\u201d\nGet the TNW newsletter\nGet the most important tech news in your inbox each week."

Denmark\u2019s Minister for Digital Affairs, Caroline Stage, tells Politiken that \"digital sovereignty\" is now a priority under the ministry\u2019s new four-year digitalization strategy.\nThe decision will also help the ministry avoid the costly undertaking of managing computers on Windows 10, which loses official support in October. However, Stage is leaving some leeway for the ministry to reverse course. \u201cIf phasing out proves to be too complicated, we can revert back to Microsoft in an instant,\u201d she says.\nLast year, a German state office announced a similar effort to transition 30,000 employees to Linux and LibreOffice.\nIn Denmark\u2019s case, two other major cities, Copenhagen and Aarhus, also want to phase out Microsoft software. Both municipalities cited President Trump's contentious stance toward Europe as a reason. Politicians in the country have also been calling for reducing Denmark\u2019s dependence on US tech companies in favor of backing open-source alternatives."

      "text": "The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping tariffs have ruffled feathers across the world \u2014 and reignited Europe\u2019s push for digital sovereignty.\nOne of the key focus points has been Europe\u2019s cloud infrastructure, which is currently dominated by US tech giants: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Together, the \u201cbig three\u201d account for more than 50% of the continent\u2019s cloud market.\n\u201cEurope has been heavily reliant on US tech and cloud for decades,\u201d said Mark Boost, CEO of UK-based web hosting company Civo. \u201cBut there are alternatives, where France, Germany, and the UK have full control of their data and cloud landscape.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s tariffs, Boost added, had \u201ccemented the idea that Europe can no longer afford to rely on the US for its digital infrastructure.\u201d\nThankfully, Europe has loads of homegrown cloud providers. The largest is France\u2019s OVHcloud, which runs the world\u2019s largest data centre by surface area. Others include Finland\u2019s UpCloud, Switzerland\u2019s Exoscale, Germany\u2019s IONOS, and France\u2019s Scaleway (the cloud provider of choice for French AI unicorn Mistral).\nThese alternative cloud providers may not match the scale and breadth of services offered by the US hyperscalers. They do, however, offer something very attractive in these uncertain geopolitical times: data sovereignty and privacy.\nAs Alexander Samsig, senior consultant and partner at Norwegian tech consultancy Funktive, put it in a recent blog post: \u201cIn 2025, the choice of a cloud provider isn\u2019t just about technology or price.\u201d\nBoost echoes that sentiment. \u201cA sovereign European cloud could foster an ecosystem defined by fairness and transparency, in which domestic providers can compete, and customers have maximum freedom to choose the service that\u2019s right for them,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s not a pipedream, either \u2014 Europe has cut its dependence on powerful American tech before and can do it again.\nEuropeans once relied entirely on the US for GPS access, but today, smartphone users on the continent can access navigation through the EU\u2019s Galileo satellite system. Launched in 2016, Galileo is one of the world\u2019s best satellite networks, and unlike others, it\u2019s a civilian system designed with secure service provision at its core. It cost around \u20ac10bn to build and deploy.\nIf Europe is truly committed to building sovereign cloud infrastructure, it will need to back up its ambitions with significant investment.\n\u201cAllocating funding for domestic sovereign clouds would also go a long way to supporting domestic industries, and would send a clear signal that Europe can chart an independent path from the US and China,\u201d said Boost.\nPolitical momentum on this front looks to be building. In a speech yesterday, France\u2019s AI minister, Clara Chappaz, called on the continent to \u201cwork as a pack\u201d to take on US \u201cpredator\u201d tech firms, particularly in the cloud services sector.\nTo shield Europe from US tech dominance, Chappaz urged the bloc to enforce its digital rulebook, stand up to Trump\u2019s \u201cidiotic\u201d trade war, and hit back with digital taxes on Big Tech \u2014 if required.\nShe also slammed \u201csovereignty washing\u201d \u2014 when US cloud giants partner with EU firms to appear sovereign \u2014 and backed strict standards like France\u2019s SecNumCloud certification, which disqualifies foreign-owned providers based on shareholding caps.\nChappaz said Europe is finally \u201cwaking up\u201d to the need for true cloud independence. The minister also claimed that both OVHcloud and Scaleway saw record client growth since Trump took office.\nEurope\u2019s digital sovereignty will be a hot topic at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

  "argos_summary": "Europe is accelerating a digital\u2011sovereignty agenda that seeks to reduce dependence on U.S. cloud giants by investing in domestic providers such as France\u2019s OVHcloud and Germany\u2019s IONOS, and by adopting open\u2011source platforms like Linux and LibreOffice in government agencies. The push has been spurred by U.S. tariffs and the CLOUD Act, which expose EU data to U.S. surveillance, prompting policy moves such as France\u2019s SecNumCloud certification and Denmark\u2019s planned phase\u2011out of Microsoft software. These initiatives aim to secure data control, enhance resilience, and foster a competitive European cloud ecosystem over the next few years.",
