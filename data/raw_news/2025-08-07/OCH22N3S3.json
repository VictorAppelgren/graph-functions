  "content": "Welcome to Bloomberg's Banking Industry Monitor. Every Thursday we'll deliver you the top news of the global banking industry with emerging trends, winners and losers and market opportunities. Sign up now if you're not already on the list.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s never too early to talk about bonus season, especially if payouts are going to be bigger this year \u2014 which they are, thanks to a volatile market. Equity traders are likely to be especially blessed, perhaps with 30% increases, but the same can\u2019t be said if your remit is retail and commercial banking. And if you\u2019re at Macquarie, bear in mind that its executive pay plan is under fire.\n\n\n\nIn less uplifting news, financial pros are trying to understand what happened at Jane Street, after India\u2019s authorities accused the firm of messing with prices. Jane Street has said it did nothing wrong. UBS meanwhile is paying the price for something it didn\u2019t do \u2014 about $300 million for missteps inherited from Credit Suisse.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump figured in more than a few banking developments this week, with tariffs putting a damper on US bank results in Europe. The president meanwhile was chatting with Big 6 bankers about a potential public offering for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 even while asserting that two, including JPMorgan Chase, had refused to do business with him in the past. It wouldn\u2019t be for lack of branches; Chase opened 1,000 new offices in the past seven years, for a total of nearly 5,000. \u2014 Rick Green\n\nThe following was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.",
