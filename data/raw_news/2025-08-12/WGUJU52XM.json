  "description": "Washington state Sen. Braun, the Republican minority leader of the state Senate, will be vying for a competitive, conservative-leaning district in southwestern Washington that was carried by President Donald Trump last year.",
  "content": "CHEHALIS, Wash. \u2014 Washington state Sen. John Braun announced Tuesday that he will run next year for the Republican nomination for the U.S. House seat held by Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez.\n\nBraun, the Republican minority leader of the Democratic-controlled state Senate, will be vying for a competitive, conservative-leaning district in southwestern Washington that was carried by President Donald Trump last year.\n\nBraun said in a statement issued by his campaign that he would work to secure borders and maintain national defense. The statement said Braun is the president of a family-owned manufacturer of emergency vehicles who served in the Navy for 31 years.\n\n\u201cI know how to fight bad policy \u2014 and how to craft good policy that makes a difference for people here in Southwest Washington. I look forward to working with President Trump on a positive agenda that gets America back on the right track,\u201d he said.\n\nThe six-term Republican who previously held the seat, Jaime Herrera Beutler, did not make it out of the primary that year. Right-wing constituents angry about her vote to impeach Trump instead cast their lot with Joe Kent, a former Army special operations soldier who promoted Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 election was stolen and touted conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez beat Kent by less than a percentage point in 2022. Heading into a rematch with Kent last fall, she was considered one of the most vulnerable members of Congress but won reelection by nearly 4 points.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez has described political polarization as destructive to democracy and used a nuts-and-bolts approach to governing.\n\nSome progressives in her district have said she has not pushed back hard enough against Trump\u2019s second presidency. But some consultants say her approach could help boost her support among independents and moderate Republicans.\n\nFederal elections filings show that Democrat Brent Hennrich, a former movie theater operations manager who has dismissed Gluesenkamp Perez\u2019s moderation as the wrong approach, and Republican businessman Antony Barran are also running for the seat.",

      "text": "U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat from southwest Washington who has established a reputation for breaking with her party on certain partisan votes, has done so once again.\nGluesenkamp Perez, a second-term member of Congress, was one of just 10 Democrats who voted with the majority Republican party on Thursday to censure Rep. Al Green, a Texas Democrat, for interrupting President Donald Trump during his address to Congress Tuesday.\nGreen, who was removed from the chamber after his outburst, later said he disrupted the speech to protest Trump\u2019s efforts to slash Medicaid funding. He is the fourth House Democrat to receive the formal reprimand in the past two years, NBC News reported.\nGluesenkamp Perez was the only Democrat from the Pacific Northwest to depart from her party on the vote. All five of Oregon\u2019s Democratic House members \u2014 three of whom walked out of the address in protest \u2014 voted against the censure.\n\u201cWhen you knowingly break House rules, as Rep. Green did, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to face consequences,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement to The Oregonian/OregonLive. \u201cCongress should respect the co-equal office of the presidency, regardless of who holds the job, do our constitutional duty, and stop with the theatrics at these events.\u201d\nThe rural Skamania County resident has long touted her ability to cross party lines on difficult votes, a trait that has vexed fellow Democrats and the liberal among her constituents. In 2023, Gluesenkamp Perez was one of 22 Democrats who voted to censure a fellow caucus member for making pro-Palestinian comments following the Hamas attack on Israel that year.\nAnd while many Democratic members of Congress have committed to actively oppose Trump and his agenda, Gluesenkamp Perez has not strayed from her promise to work with lawmakers of any party.\n\u201cPartisan tensions are flaring in the media \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t eliminate the need to solve the problems that matter to Southwest Washington and that most of us agree on,\u201d she said in a statement ahead of the presidential address.\nGluesenkamp Perez in November defeated Republican Joe Kent for the second consecutive election to continue representing Washington\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, a Trump-leaning district that includes much of the state\u2019s southwest corner.\n\u2014 Carlos Fuentes covers state politics and government.

      "text": "Months into her second term, U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of southwest Washington continues to make headlines for her unique approach to politics in today\u2019s hyperpartisan Congress.\nBut her most recent eye-catching statement in an interview with The New York Times had nothing to do with her self-described centrism. In her conversation with Times columnist and podcast host Ezra Klein, Gluesenkamp Perez said she prefers to not give her 3-year-old son toys to play with.\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking to a lady who doesn\u2019t give my child toys,\u201d the Democrat said in response to a soundbite of President Donald Trump acknowledging that his tariffs might raise prices on playthings. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in dirt and string and sticks.\u201d\nGluesenkamp Perez, who in November defeated Republican opponent Joe Kent in a rematch from 2022, told The Oregonian/OregonLive in a follow up statement she believes many adults undervalue \u201chands-on\u201d experiences that can improve children\u2019s imagination and confidence.\nHer own son mostly plays with \u201creal tools, hand-me-downs from his older cousins, and spends a lot of time outside,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to believe that kids need to be entertained \u2014 parenting is more fun when a child knows their parents are available, interested, and confident in their child\u2019s inner world and creativity,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez said.\nThat sentiment from Gluesenkamp Perez will shock few of her longtime observers. Early in her first term, the auto repair shop co-owner-turned-politician told a crowded town hall that she felt more comfortable on the dirt roads of her district than the streets of Washington D.C. She has also said she prefers not to wear suits to avoid coming across as unapproachable.\nPolitical pundits quickly labelled Gluesenkamp Perez as a freshman member to watch after she narrowly won election in 2022 in a district that has reliably voted for Trump. She has continued to draw national attention for touting her commitment to rural voters in her district, which stretches from coastal communities to timber country deep in the Cascade Mountain Range.\nGluesenkamp Perez\u2019s attitude towards new toys extends to most modern technologies and reflects her general economic philosophy. She described herself as a luddite in early 2023 and told the Times that her stove and washing machine were both built in the 20th century.\nThe Democrat says her preference for durable, years-old technology reflects her desire to uplift American workers who create such sturdy appliances and goods.\nApart from toys, the recent hour-long interview mostly focused on Gluesenkamp Perez\u2019s approach to a second Trump administration and how her message to voters has differentiated herself from many members of her own party.\nWhile many Democrats at the national level have taken a strong stance against Trump\u2019s international trade policies, Gluesenkamp Perez has offered a quieter, more nuanced response. After all, she has long expressed a commitment to boosting manufacturing and growing jobs in the United States \u2014 both of which Trump has cited as primary goals of implementing tariffs.\n\u201cAt a broader level, tariffs are a tool,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez said in the Times interview. \u201cA tool can be used destructively, or it can be used productively. And it depends on how it\u2019s wielded.\u201d\nGluesenkamp Perez has taken significant criticism from some of her liberal constituents for statements they view as catering to Republicans. Although she reliably sides with her Democratic colleagues on most votes, she crosses the aisle more than almost any other member of her party, sometimes on controversial issues.\nFor instance, Gluesenkamp Perez was one of only four Democrats last month who voted for the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would have required individuals to present proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Gluesenkamp Perez later said the proposed policy was a \u201ccommon sense\u201d vote that her constituents supported while many Democrats slammed the bill for potentially creating barriers to voting access.\nGluesenkamp Perez also is quick to criticize members of her own party, saying they are out of touch with voters or rushing to oppose Trump without good reason. For example, she told Klein she has been confused by Democrats\u2019 inconsistent messaging on tariffs and economic philosophy.\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s weird is watching the Democratic Party suddenly become the defenders of the stock market and Nasdaq,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez said. \u201cThat\u2019s a weird thing to me.\u201d\n\u2014 Carlos Fuentes covers state politics and government.

      "text": "The road to retaining Republican control of the U.S. House of Representatives runs through southwest Washington.\nThat\u2019s the assertion Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson made at an August fundraiser for Joe Kent, a military veteran endorsed by former President Donald Trump who is running for a second time to represent Washington\u2019s 3rd Congressional District after narrowly losing in 2022.\nThat year, Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, who had never held elected office, shocked the political world by beating Kent in a district that had voted for Trump by nearly four percentage points in 2020 and sent a Republican to Congress in six consecutive elections. She prevailed by fewer than 3,000 votes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a leaning Republican district. It\u2019s a district that mainstream, normal Republicans should have no problem winning,\u201d said Dean Nielsen, a veteran Seattle-based political consultant. \u201cJoe Kent is different.\u201d\nKent has largely aligned himself with Trump-endorsed policies, including supporting the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, and received strong support from the district\u2019s most conservative voters. Gluesenkamp Perez, meanwhile, has campaigned on her rural roots and commitment to strengthening the working class and advocating for farmers and small businesses.\nThe two candidates are preparing for a rematch that experts anticipate could be one of the closest races in the country. Nearby, in Oregon\u2019s 5th District, Democratic state lawmaker Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer in another of the nation\u2019s most competitive races.\nThis year\u2019s race between Gluesenkamp Perez and Kent has received national attention and drawn huge spending, with national groups contributing millions of dollars in hopes of helping their party claim a majority in the U.S. House. Democrats need to net four seats to retake the majority.\n\u201cEverybody in the country who follows politics is watching that district,\u201d said Stuart Elway, a longtime pollster based in Seattle.\nA moderate Democrat\nThe 3rd District spans a vast geographic area, stretching from small coastal communities to deep timber country located in the Cascade Mountain Range. The bulk of the population, however, lives in a relatively small area centered around Vancouver, the largest city in Clark County. About two-thirds of registered voters in the district live in that county.\nGluesenkamp Perez, 36, lives in rural Skamania County in the southeastern part of the district and prides herself on being a staunch advocate in Congress for rural, working class people. Prior to entering office, Gluesenkamp Perez helped her husband run an auto shop in Portland, which the two opened after she graduated from Reed College in 2012 and still own.\nDespite attending one of the country\u2019s most liberal colleges, Gluesenkamp Perez has solidified herself as a moderate in Congress, co-chairing the Blue Dog Coalition. And she has made national headlines for her willingness to vote against her party when she thinks it will benefit her district.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many Democrats running for Congress who pose in their brochure with a chainsaw in front of an old growth tree,\u201d Elway said.\nIn a 2023 ranking compiled by The Lugar Center and Georgetown University\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy, Gluesenkamp Perez ranked fourth among Democrats and 12th overall for most bipartisan members of the 435-member U.S. House of Representatives.\nPerhaps the most significant example of Gluesenkamp Perez departing from her party was her vote last year against President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan. She was one of only two Democrats who voted against the bill, citing its lack of support for career and technical education.\n\u201cMy district only accounts for 3% of the federally-issued student debt in the state \u2014 it was not a good deal for us,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez told The Oregonian/OregonLive. \u201cI\u2019m not here to score points for a political team. I\u2019m here to fight for our way of life in southwest Washington.\u201d\nGluesenkamp Perez has championed legislation to support small businesses and farmers. Last month, she introduced a bill that would establish zero-interest loans for farmers to buy land designated for specialty crops. Last year, she voted against advancing the farm bill out of the House Agriculture Committee, saying that it did not go far enough in supporting family farms.\nGluesenkamp Perez has used her platform to bring several powerful federal officials, including Biden senior adviser Mitch Landrieu and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, to give them an up-close look at the district.\nThree months into her term, she took U.S. Small Business Administration director Isabel Guzman to a Vancouver climbing gym so she could hear about the owner\u2019s experience applying for pandemic-era federal grants and brought Xochitl Torres-Small, the undersecretary of the federal Department of Agriculture, to a rural property to hear from farmers about their biggest needs.\n\u201cA lot of my colleagues seem to think they can just send an email and that will yield results for their community,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez said. \u201cI know that it takes work to make our issues human-scale to the federal government. You got to bring them out here and talk about things in concrete terms.\u201d\nGluesenkamp Perez\u2019s focus on her constituents, experts say, is likely the reason that she has racked up endorsements from numerous labor unions and trade groups. Her long list of supporters include the state\u2019s largest unions representing police and sheriffs, firefighters, farmers and teachers.\n\u201cShe\u2019s done a lot of outreach and really stepped up in a way that a lot of people in Congress have not in the past,\u201d said Lorne Bulling, political director for Ironworkers Local 29, which represents ironworkers in Oregon and southwest Washington. \u201cShe\u2019s been incredibly accessible and always has made time.\u201d\nTrump-endorsed challenger\nKent\u2019s polarizing views have made him a divisive candidate since he first ran in 2022.\nThe 44-year old from Yacolt, a small town 30 miles northeast of Vancouver, has a compelling background that resonates in a district that reveres its veterans. Kent served in the U.S. Army for two decades before becoming a field operative for the CIA. He then worked as a foreign policy adviser for the Trump administration. His first wife, a Navy cryptologic technician, was killed in a 2019 bombing in Syria.\nIf elected, Kent said his top priorities would include cutting unnecessary government spending, securing the southern U.S. border and imposing large tariffs on foreign imports, all Trump priorities.\n\u201cEverything these guys have tried has failed,\u201d Kent said, referring to Democrats and the Biden administration, during a packed September town hall in Vancouver. \u201cThe economy is being destroyed because of their policies. The border\u2019s wide open. Fentanyl is flooding the district. We\u2019re on the cusp of a major nuclear exchange and World War III on multiple fronts on the world stage, the list goes on.\u201d\nKent has received strong support from the district\u2019s most conservative voters. \u201cWhat he is focused on is being a Trump Republican, and that has not changed\u201d since he ran in 2022, said Mark Stephan, a political science professor at Washington State University in Vancouver.\nKent has shifted his stance on some controversial issues, including abortion. Kent said in 2022 that he fully supported a national abortion ban, calling abortion a \u201cstain on our democracy.\u201d He now says he supports each state enacting its own laws.\nKent declined multiple interview requests from The Oregonian/OregonLive through his campaign manager and didn\u2019t respond to a list of emailed questions.\nWhen Kent ran for the seat in 2022, The Associated Press reported that he had close ties with several known right-wing extremist groups and activists. Kent hired a campaign consultant that year who was a member of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group. Kent was also an ally of Joey Gibson, the founder of a Christian nationalist group that held demonstrations in Portland that often resulted in physical confrontations with left-wing activists.\nAfter facing backlash in 2022 for working on social media strategy with internet personality Nick Fuentes, who has espoused white supremacist beliefs, Kent appeared on a podcast to address the controversy. While he sought to distance himself from Fuentes, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with there being a white people special interest group.\u201d\nTrump also received criticism for dining with Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago in November 2022.\nNielsen, the Seattle political consultant, said Kent\u2019s extreme views and ties have likely cost him the support of some moderate voters. \u201cJoe Kent really turns off a lot of moderate voters and even more traditional conservatives that don\u2019t really approve of the MAGA style,\u201d he said.\nKent\u2019s supporters have tried to downplay those ties to far-right groups and individuals. \u201cIt was a lot of (Kent being) guilty by association,\u201d said Jim Walsh, a Republican state lawmaker and chair of the Washington State Republican Party. \u201cAs I understand it, he knew some people who were connected to the Proud Boys.\u201d\nAlong with his endorsement from Trump, Kent has support from several conservative members of Congress and from the county and state Republican party chapters. However, his campaign website does not provide a list of his endorsements like most campaigns do. Kent\u2019s campaign manager didn\u2019t respond to an email asking for a full list of endorsements.\n\u201cHe\u2019s genuine, he believes in work and in self-reliance, self-actualization,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThese are things that southwest Washington values.\u201d\nTrading blows\nGluesenkamp Perez and Kent have embraced starkly different campaigning strategies, a contrast that was on full display Wednesday at their first debate, held in Longview.\nGluesenkamp Perez says her proven commitment to the district, including its rural, working class voters, makes her worthy of another term. Kent, meanwhile, focused on national issues, criticizing Democrats\u2019 handling of the U.S.-Mexico border and the economy.\n\u201cWe actually saw working class wages rise under President Trump. We can easily bring that back,\u201d Kent said. \u201cPresident Trump just needs a Congress that\u2019s actually going to support him and not fight him.\u201d\nFederal data shows that wages steadily increased during much of Trump\u2019s administration, following a trend that began under President Barack Obama. But the most rapid increases came during the pandemic when lower wage workers were disproportionately impacted by layoffs.\n\u201cYou can hear clearly that this is about partisan politics for him. It\u2019s about delivering a Republican majority,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez responded. \u201cI\u2019m not here for that. I\u2019m here for us.\u201d\nSince Gluesenkamp Perez entered Congress last year, Kent has aggressively attacked her voting record. He has criticized her support for a Biden-sponsored bill that blocked local policies restricting transgender students from using the bathroom of their choice. He has also opposed her backing of the Interstate Bridge replacement between Portland and Vancouver, arguing instead for the construction of a new bridge farther down the Columbia River that he says would alleviate congestion while saving costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to send someone to Washington, D.C., who\u2019s not going to prioritize simple party politics, the military industrial complex and big pharma infringements on our basic civil liberties,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to actually represent the people.\u201d\nIn defense of her voting record, Gluesenkamp Perez said that she has always acted in the district\u2019s best interests. \u201cIf he\u2019s saying that my accomplishments and my values, my record in D.C. are small, then he\u2019s saying transportation for rural veterans is small ... supporting the timber industry and our paper and pulp industries is small,\u201d she said. \u201cThose things aren\u2019t small. They\u2019re our values.\u201d\nPolitical experts and insiders say they aren\u2019t surprised by the differing tactics.\n\u201cRepublicans are trying to talk about the border all the time. The border and the economy are the two issues they think they have,\u201d pollster Elway said. On the other hand, Gluesenkamp Perez is \u201cobviously very attuned to her district, very oriented toward the local constituency, much less so on the national issues. She\u2019s trying to localize the race and he\u2019s trying to nationalize it.\u201d\nWhile the 3rd District race largely fell under the national radar in 2022, it hasn\u2019t this time around.\nGluesenkamp Perez had raised more than $6.7 million as of mid-July, and Kent had raised $1.4 million as of mid-August, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The candidates will report updated campaign finance data later this month.\nNational groups have spent millions of dollars to flood the Portland media market with attack ads against both candidates. Outside groups have dropped more than $4 million to oppose Kent and almost $1.9 million to oppose Gluesenkamp Perez, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has devoted a whopping $2.7 million to attack Kent while the House Majority PAC, the largest super PAC helping to elect Democrats to the U.S. House, has spent $1.15 million against him, according to Open Secrets.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee has allotted nearly $1.8 million to attack Gluesenkamp Perez, Open Secrets reported.\n\u201cThe House is on the knife\u2019s edge, and this race is probably the closest of any of them,\u201d Elway said. \u201cSo from their standpoint, they\u2019ve got to spend that money. ... It could come down to this one.\u201d\n\u2014 Carlos Fuentes covers state politics and government. Reach him at 503-221-5386 or cfuentes@oregonian.com.\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "First-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez has defeated Republican Joe Kent in the race to represent southwest Washington in Congress.\nAs of 6 p.m. Thursday, Washington election officials reported that Gluesenkamp Perez led by 51.3% to 48.3%, a difference of 11,000 votes. That margin has eroded just slightly since election night.\nIt compares to her winning edge of fewer than 5,000 votes in 2022.\nThe fact that Gluesenkamp Perez has a glide path to victory, while Kent lacks a plausible path to winning, is primarily because the largest share by far of untallied ballots are in Clark County, where roughly two thirds of 3rd District voters live. The county still has an estimated 40,000 votes to count, according to state election officials, and so far 56% of Clark County\u2019s votes have gone her way. There are negligible numbers of outstanding ballots in other of the district\u2019s counties, according to reports from county election offices.\nIn 2022, Gluesenkamp Perez, who had never held elected office, shocked the political world by beating Kent in a district that had voted for former President Donald Trump by nearly four percentage points two years earlier. Experts expected this year\u2019s race in Washington\u2019s 3rd Congressional District to again be one of the closest in the country.\nOREGON ELECTION 2024: Live Results Page | Election Live Updates\nThe race received national attention and drew huge spending, with national groups contributing millions in hopes of helping their party claim a majority in the U.S. House.\nThe balance of power in the U.S. House has yet to be determined. Democrats needed to net four seats to take control of that chamber. As of Thursday night, Republicans needed to win seven more seats for control and Democrats needed 18. Competitive races throughout the country had yet to be called.\nKent largely aligned himself with positions embraced by Trump, including supporting the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, and received strong support from the district\u2019s most conservative voters. Gluesenkamp Perez, meanwhile, campaigned on her rural roots and commitment to strengthening the working class and advocating for farmers and small businesses.\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful for this vote of confidence in the work I\u2019ve done to set aside national politics and represent our community in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez said in a Thursday statement.\n\u201cLike two years ago, pundits made a fundamental mistake by viewing this race through a partisan lens,\u201d she said. \u201cOur community has never seen ourselves this way, and it\u2019s not how we evaluate who merits our vote for Congress.\u201d\nGluesenkamp Perez lives in rural Skamania County in the southeastern part of the district and prides herself on being a staunch advocate in Congress for rural, working class people. Prior to entering office, Gluesenkamp Perez helped her husband run an auto shop in Portland, which the two opened after she graduated from Reed College in 2012, and still own.\nDespite attending one of the country\u2019s most liberal colleges, Gluesenkamp Perez has solidified herself as a moderate in Congress, co-chairing the Blue Dog Coalition. And she has made national headlines for her willingness to vote against her party when she thinks it will benefit her district.\nIn a 2023 ranking compiled by The Lugar Center and Georgetown University\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy, Gluesenkamp Perez ranked fourth among Democrats and 12th overall for most bipartisan members of the 435-member U.S. House of Representatives.\n\u201cI think 90% of people in southwest Washington agree on 90% of things, regardless of their political identity,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez said in her statement. \u201cWe are not the sort of place where we define ourselves and our neighbors by our bumper stickers.\u201d\nShe has also brought several powerful federal officials, including Biden senior adviser Mitch Landrieu and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, to the district.\nGluesenkamp Perez\u2019s focus on her constituents, experts said, is likely the reason she racked up endorsements from labor unions and trade groups. Her long list of supporters included the state\u2019s largest unions representing police and sheriffs, firefighters, farmers and teachers.\nKent served in the U.S. Army for two decades before becoming a field operative for the CIA. He then worked as a foreign policy adviser for the Trump administration. Kent\u2019s first wife, a Navy cryptologic technician, was killed in a 2019 bombing in Syria.\nIf elected, he promised to cut unnecessary government spending, secure the southern U.S. border and impose large tariffs on foreign imports, all Trump priorities. Along with an endorsement from Trump, he was endorsed by several conservative members of Congress and the county and state Republican party chapters.\nGluesenkamp Perez had raised nearly $10.7 million and Kent had raised $2.3 million as of mid-October, according to federal filings. Outside groups dropped nearly $10.3 million to oppose Kent and almost $6.2 million to oppose Gluesenkamp Perez, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics.\nLatest local politics stories\n- Oregon will lose billions due to Trump tax bill, state analysis finds\n- Oregon\u2019s new statewide shelter system has 4,800 beds; here\u2019s a map\n- ICE arrests Guatemalan workers heading to harvest berries near Woodburn, advocate group says\n- Oregon small businesses grapple with loss of federal aid for minority-owned startups\n- Gov.
