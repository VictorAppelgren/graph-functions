      "title": "Are Investors Undervaluing Amplitude, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMPL) By 37%?",
      "summary": "Amplitude Inc. (NASDAQ:AMPL) is currently trading at $11.43, well below its DCF‑derived fair value of $18.19, implying a 37% intrinsic discount and a >20% undervaluation relative to the 12‑month analyst target of $15.67. The valuation uses an 8.4% discount rate, a 3.1% terminal growth rate, and a 10‑year free‑cash‑flow projection, yielding a total equity value of $2.4 billion. Despite being unprofitable and projected to remain so for the next three years, the company has a cash runway of over three years and is considered a strong buy by analysts. The consensus view is that the stock offers significant upside, with the price expected to rise toward the fair value over the medium term.",
