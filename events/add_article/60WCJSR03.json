      "summary": "Crude and gasoline prices fell in September, with WTI down 2.6% and RBOB 3%. The decline is driven by concerns over global energy demand amid President Trump's new tariff regime, weaker U.S. payroll and ISM data, and a 2‑week low in the S&P 500 that dampened confidence. A stronger dollar and expectations of a supply glut from OPEC+ also weigh on prices. The market remains cautious ahead of the August 7 tariff effective date and upcoming OPEC+ meetings.",
