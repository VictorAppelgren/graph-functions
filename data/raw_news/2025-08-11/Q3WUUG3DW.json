  "description": "Billionaire Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg owns the largest private collection of Faberg\u00e9 eggs in the world.",
  "content": "Gemfields, a colored gemstone miner listed on the London stock exchange, sold the fabled brand to tech entrepreneur Sergei Mosunov\u2019s U.S. company SMG Capital. Gemfields will receive $45 million when the deal closes later this month, and the remaining $5 million through quarterly royalty payments. The company said it will use the money from the sale to help fund its mining operations for rubies in Mozambique and emeralds in Zambia. Sean Gilbertson, the chief executive of Gemfields, said the company would miss the \"marketing leverage and star power\" that came from owning Faberg\u00e9, despite the fact the brand has struggled in recent years amid a downturn in the luxury goods market. Faberg\u00e9 has been one of the most renowned jewelers in the world for almost 200 years but has seen revenue fall in recent years\u2014it reported revenues of $13.4 million in 2024, down from $15.7 million the previous year and $17.6 million in 2022.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here: joinsubtext.com/forbes.\n\n\u201cFaberg\u00e9\u2019s unique heritage, with ties to Russia, England, France and the USA, opens significant opportunities for further strengthening its position in the global luxury market and expanding its international presence,\u201d Mosunov, a Russian national based in the U.K., said in a statement. \u201cWe feel a deep sense of responsibility and incredible inspiration for the work ahead.\"\n\nThe House of Faberg\u00e9 jewelry company was founded in 1842 in St. Petersburg, Russia, by Gustav Faberg\u00e9. His son, Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9, was commissioned by Emperor Alexander III in 1885 to create an extravagant Easter gift for his wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna, and the famous Faberg\u00e9 eggs were born. Known as \"First Hen,\" the original product is made of gold and coated with white enamel, with a gold hen set with ruby eyes hidden inside. The emperor continued to have them made each year, reportedly giving Faberg\u00e9 complete creative freedom, and 50 were ultimately made for the Russian Imperial Family, known as the \"Imperial Eggs.\" Nineteen other eggs were made for the aristocracy and other elites. When the Romanov family fell during the Russian Revolution of 1917, the 50 Imperial Eggs were scattered all over the world, and some remain lost to this day. The eggs were crafted from gold or silver and encrusted with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires and other precious stones. They often included hidden items inside, like a miniature Trans-Siberian Railway train made of gold or a tiny, working replica of the Imperial coach used in Nicholas II's coronation. Today, Faberg\u00e9 makes fine jewelry and egg objects inspired by the original eggs. They\u2019re priced starting at $60,000.\n\n7. That's how many Imperial Easter Eggs are still missing. Eight were missing until 2014, when a buyer at a Midwestern flea market bought one for about $14,000. Kieran McCarthy, a London antiques dealer, told PBS News an anonymous buyer purchased the egg with hopes of making a small profit reselling it for its gold content. It was then authenticated as one of the real eggs. It features a Vacheron Constantin watch and sits atop a jeweled gold stand.\n\nThe most expensive egg is known as the Third Imperial Easter Egg, which was made in 1887. It has a solid gold case covered in sapphires and diamonds and houses a women's watch with diamond-set gold hands. It was once valued at $33 million and is owned by an anonymous private collector.\n\nBillionaire Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg owns 15 Faberg\u00e9 Easter Eggs, making him the largest private collector in the world. Vekselberg bought nine Imperial Eggs from the Forbes media family, at the time the world's largest private collection, in 2004 for just over $100 million. He also owns two Kelch, eggs made for Russian nobleman Alexander Ferdinandovich Kelch, and four other eggs. At the time of his purchase from the Forbes family, he said the collection represented \u201cperhaps the most significant example of our cultural heritage outside Russia. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to give back to my country one of its most revered treasures.\" Vekselberg\u2019s eggs are on display at the Faberg\u00e9 Museum in St. Petersburg. The British royal family also owns three Imperial Eggs, originally purchased by King George V and Queen Mary, King Charles's great-grandparents.\n\nVekselberg is worth an estimated $9.4 million as of Monday, making him the 328th-richest person in the world. He is a Ukrainian-born aluminum baron who made his first million selling scrap copper from worn-out cables and later turned several medium-size aluminum smelters and bauxite mines into Sual Holding in 1996. He later made his fortune in oil. His $120 million superyacht, Tango, was seized by Spanish police and the FBI in Palma de Mallorca in April 2022.",

      "text": "1. The first Faberg\u00e9 Egg was created for the Russian Royal Family.\nThe famous Faberg\u00e9 eggs were first created in 1885 when Emperor Alexander III commissioned Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 to create a spectacularly extravagant Easter gift to cheer up his young, homesick wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna.\nFaberg\u00e9\u2019s original idea was to create an egg containing a diamond ring in the centre; however, the Emperor had other ideas and gave strict instructions that the final finished egg must contain a ruby pendant.\nThe egg had an opaque white enamelled outer shell which opened by twisting the two halves of the egg to reveal the first surprise \u2013 a matt yellow gold yolk. Following that, was an enamelled, chased gold hen that held a replica of the Imperial Crown with a precious ruby pendant egg.\nHis young wife was so impressed by her exquisite gift that the Emperor continued to have them made each year.\n2. Faberg\u00e9 made a total of sixty nine spectacularly jewelled eggs.\nIn total, sixty nine spectacularly jewelled Easter eggs were made by Faberg\u00e9 between 1883 and 1917. Fifty of these were made for the Russian Imperial family and are known as the \u2018Imperial Eggs\u2019. The other eggs were made for the aristocracy and the industrial and financial elite. Known as Faberg\u00e9 eggs, they are a symbol of overt luxury, but of the original sixty-nine, unfortunately only sixty-one remain.\nB\u00e9atrice Ephrussi de Rothschild presented this egg to Germaine Halphen upon her engagement to B\u00e9atrice\u2019s younger brother, \u00c9douard Alphonse James de Rothschild.\nUpon the hour, a diamond-set cockerel pops up from the top of the egg, flaps its wings four times, then nods his head three times, crowing all the while. This lasts for fifteen seconds before the clock strikes the hour on a bell.\n3. Eight eggs are currently still unaccounted for.\nWhen the Romanov family fell during the Russian Revolution of 1917, the fifty Imperial Eggs were sadly looted and scattered all around the world.\nOne of the missing eggs, the Imperial Faberg\u00e9 N\u00e9cessaire Egg, was crafted in 1889 and was exquisitely set with diamonds, emeralds and rubies, and was intended to hold beauty tools. It was last seen at Wartski in June 1952 where it was sold to a mysterious buyer simply named \u2018A Stranger\u2019 for \u00a31250.\n4. One was found at a flea market.\nIncredibly, in 2014, an American scrap metal dealer purchased the golden egg at a flea market for $13,300 (\u00a38000), not realizing what he had found. When he failed to sell it on because prospective buyers thought it to be over priced, he decided to research the piece further. Only to discover that he was in fact the owner of a long lost Imperial Egg worth \u00a320 million. The egg now belongs to a private collector.\nThe egg, known as the Third Imperial Egg, was given to Empress Maria Feodorovna for Easter in 1887.\nThe reeded yellow gold egg opens by pressing the brilliant cut diamond, to reveal a Vacheron Constantin watch with diamond set gold hands that is hinged, allowing it to stand upright. The egg is supported on an elaborate sabl\u00e9d gold stand, stood on lion paw feet and encircled by finely chased coloured gold garlands, suspended from three cabochon blue sapphires and topped with rose diamond set bows.\n5. Faberg\u00e9 also made eggs for another wealthy Russian family.\nAnother patron of Faberg\u00e9 at the same time as the Romanov\u2019s was Alexander Kelch. Kelch commissioned a total of seven eggs for his wife Barbara as well as the famous Kelch Gothic Revival silver service; considered by Faberg\u00e9 to be the most important silver masterpiece created by his workshop.\nWhilst the eggs created for other families were incredibly luxurious, none matched the extravagance of the Imperial eggs.\nThe Kelch Chanticleer Egg\n6. Who owns them now?\nFaberg\u00e9 eggs are unsurprisingly the ultimate collector\u2019s piece. Not only are they incredibly elusive and part of possibly the largest Easter egg hunt in the world, but their craftsmanship and beauty are simply immeasurable.\nKing George V and Queen Mary were both keen collectors of Faberg\u00e9 and in 1933, purchased three of the Imperial eggs for their own collection \u2013 The Mosaic Egg, The Colonnade Egg and The Basket of Flowers Egg. The collection now belongs to their daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, along with many other Faberg\u00e9 items which she has also added to the collection.\nTen of the Imperial Eggs are on display at Moscow\u2019s Kremlin Armory Museum.\nMany of the eggs belong to museums and private collectors.\nOne private collector, Viktor Vekselberg, owns a total of fifteen Faberg\u00e9 This makes him the single largest owner of Faberg\u00e9 eggs in the world. He owns nine Imperial, two Kelch, and four other Faberg\u00e9 eggs. In a 2013 documentary by BBC Four, Vekselberg revealed that he had spent just over $100 million purchasing the nine Faberg\u00e9 Imperial eggs from the Forbes collection.\nThe Colonnade Egg, The Mosaic Egg with surprise and The Basket of Flowers Egg.\nOwned by Queen Elizabeth II.\n7. Each egg took a year or more to complete.\nA team of highly skilled craftsmen worked in complete secrecy on each egg. Faberg\u00e9 was given complete freedom with the design and execution of the eggs, with the only prerequisite being that there must be a surprise hidden within each one.\nThe Gatchina Palace Egg\n8. Faberg\u00e9 didn\u2019t just make eggs.\nAlthough Faberg\u00e9 is most famous for his Imperial Eggs, these only represent a small proportion of what the famous Faberg\u00e9 Jewellery House created.\nThere was, of course, the jewellery and the silverware but also snuff boxes, table clocks, and even miniature items of furniture. In fact, any objet d\u2019art you can think of, Faberg\u00e9 has most likely made it.\nFor Faberg\u00e9, it was all about the design and innovation, not about what the item itself was. He took inspiration from the history of European arts as well as traditional Russian crafts to create his iconic pieces.\nFrom left to right:\n- Jewelled parcel-gilt silver-mounted oak presentation desk. Circa 1906.\n- Faberg\u00e9 diamond tiara. Circa 1890.\n- Rare Faberg\u00e9 Imperial silver rhinoceros automaton. Circa 1909.\n- Carved hardstone model of a street painter. Circa 1916.\n- Silver and Cloisonn\u00e9 Enamel Kovsh. Circa 1908 \u2013 1917.\n9. Faberg\u00e9 made a one of a kind \u2018Imperial\u2019 Egg in 2015.\nPaying homage to the Imperial tradition, Faberg\u00e9 collaborated with the Al-Fardan family, one of the world\u2019s most renowned collectors of pearls, to create a truly exquisite egg in the style of the famous Imperial Eggs. Drawing inspiration from the formation of a pearl within an oyster, the stunning Pearl Egg has a mother of pearl shell which opens up to reveal a unique 12.17ct grey pearl sourced from the Arabian Gulf which has exceptional purity and a highly unusual shade of grey."

      "text": "\u00d7\nThe spectacular Faberg\u00e9 Egg has a rich history. But how much does the most expensive Faberg\u00e9 Egg cost?\nWe can tell you now that the most expensive Faberg\u00e9 Egg once had a valuation of a cool $33m! But which Faberg\u00e9 Egg was it?\nFirst, here's a little information about the story behind these iconic creations.\nWhat is a Faberg\u00e9 Egg?\nThe jewellery company House of Faberg\u00e9, based in Saint Petersburg, began in 1842\nThe jewellery company House of Faberg\u00e9, based in Saint Petersburg, began in 1842. While Gustav Faberg\u00e9 founded the firm, his son Peter Carl would oversee the creation of almost all these now famous and iconic eggs.\nMade between 1885 and 1917, there were once 69 eggs, with estimates suggesting that 57 still exist today.\nNeedless to say that at Westland London, while we have many fine premier antiques in stock, we don't sell Faberg\u00e9 Eggs! Those that are not lost are now in private collections or museums, while some are sitting in the homes of very lucky individual owners.\nThe most well-known are the Imperial eggs - there were 52, of which 46 survive. Created for Russian tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II, the stunning jewelled eggs were Easter presents for their wives and mothers.\nThe first Faberg\u00e9 Egg\nIt opened to reveal a 'surprise' - a gold yolk design containing a small hen sitting on straw\nIn the year 1885, Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 created the Hen egg. It opened to reveal a 'surprise' - a gold yolk design containing a small hen sitting on straw, all gold as well.\nThe hen also had a surprise - inside there was a miniature diamond Imperial crown plus a ruby pendant. The egg was a present from Alexander III to his wife.\nThe egg was a resounding success for the House of Faberg\u00e9. Just a few weeks later, it formally became a supplier as a 'goldsmith by special appointment' to the Imperial Crown.\nAlexander III commissioned another egg for the following year. Allegedly, Peter Carl had free reign to choose a design, as long as each egg was unique and contained a surprise inside.\nThis second Imperial egg is known as the Hen with Sapphire Pendant. While today the Hen egg has an owner, the subsequent Hen with Sapphire Pendant egg is lost.\nUntil relatively recently, it appeared the 'third' Imperial egg was lost too. That all changed in 2011 when it was re-discovered, having gone missing during the second half of the 20th century.\nThe most expensive Faberg\u00e9 Egg\nWe do know that the egg once had a $33m valuation\nA scrap dealer found it in America - then it sat in his kitchen for several years!\nShortly after it was identified by Wartski and now it's the most expensive Faberg\u00e9 Egg ever, known simply as the Third Imperial Easter egg.\nA collector purchased it for an undisclosed amount in 2014, but we do know that the egg once had a $33m valuation.\nIt has a solid 18k gold case covered in sapphires and diamonds. Inside the egg, there's also a 14k gold Vacheron Constantin Lady's watch - it has a white enamel dial with openwork diamond-set gold hands.\nDesigned in the Louis XVI style, Alexander III presented it to his wife Maria Feodorovna on Orthodox Easter back in the year 1887.\nHere are some of the most expensive Faberg\u00e9 Eggs in the world:\n- Third Imperial Easter, from 1887, valued at $33m\n- Rothschild Clock, from 1902, valued at $25.1m\n- Imperial Coronation, from 1897, valued at $18m\n- Winter, from 1913, valued at $15.6m\n- Bay Tree, from 1911, valued at $15m\nSo as you can see, the typical Faberg\u00e9 Egg price, for one of the most coveted designs, is several million!\n\u00d7\nFinal thoughts\nWatch out for imitations on the market\nAlexander III died in 1894, the year of the 10th Imperial egg. His son, Nicholas II, continued the tradition and presented many eggs in the following years to either his wife or his mother.\nA few private clients also commissioned Faberg\u00e9 to create similar eggs, including the Rothschild family.\nAs mentioned, we don't have Faberg\u00e9 Eggs here at Westland. And if you're a collector, as Christie's advises, watch out for imitations on the market.\nBut if you're interested in antiques from this period, take a look at our collection of Victorian and Edwardian era pieces, including fireplaces.\nAnd staying with jewellery and decorations, check out our antique jewelry identification guide or even our to learn more about the wide range of imprinted symbols.\nOur latest stock is here and if you have any queries, please don't hesitate to contact us."

      "text": "The imperial eggs\nThe celebrated series of 50 Imperial Easter eggs was created for the Russian Imperial family from 1885 to 1916 when the company was run by Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9. These creations are inextricably linked to the glory and tragic fate of the last Romanov family. They were the ultimate achievement of the renowned Russian jewellery house and must also be considered the last great commissions of objets d\u2019art . Ten eggs were produced from 1885 to 1893, during the reign of Emperor Alexander III; 40 more were created during the rule of his dutiful son, Nicholas II, two each year, one for his mother, the dowager, the second for his wife.\nThe series began in 1885 when Emperor Alexander III, through the intermediary of his uncle, Grand Duke Vladimir, commissioned an Easter egg from Faberg\u00e9 as an Easter present for his wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna. Initially planned by Faberg\u00e9 to contain a diamond ring, the actual finished version, following specific instructions of the Emperor, included a ruby pendant of great value. After the first commission, Faberg\u00e9 was bestowed \u2018goldsmith by special appointment to the Imperial Crown\u2019, and the legend continued over the next 31 years. According to Faberg\u00e9 family tradition, the company was given complete freedom for the future Imperial Easter Eggs. Not even the Emperor knew what form they would take. The only stipulation was that each one should contain a surprise.\nThe Imperial Eggs\nImage courtesy of the Forbes Collection\nThe Hen Egg\nInspired by an 18th century original, the Hen Egg has an opaque white enamelled outer \u2018shell\u2019, opening with a twist to reveal a first surprise - a matt yellow gold yolk. This in turn contains an enamelled chased gold hen that once held a replica of the Imperial Crown with a precious ruby pendant egg within. The drop by itself cost more than half of the egg\u2019s total price (both lost, being only known from an old photograph).\nHeritage Hen Locket\nThe Heritage collection draws inspiration from Faberg\u00e9\u2019s historical masterpieces. Traditional materials and complex traditional techniques, such as the delicate art of guilloch\u00e9 enamelling and hand-engraving, make up the signature elements of this colourful and opulent collection.\nImage courtesy of the Getty Images\nThe Mosaic Egg\nThe Mosaic Egg is a triumph of technical brilliance and artistic finesse. Commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II for Empress Alexandra, it features a delicate micro-mosaic of precious gems set in platinum to resemble petit point embroidery. Designed by Alma Theresia Pihl, the egg\u2019s intricate beauty is matched by its heartfelt surprise\u2014a miniature portrait of the imperial children\u2014making it one of the most cherished treasures of the Imperial Faberg\u00e9 collection.\nMosaic Egg Pendant\nIn a compelling mix of impeccable craftsmanship and the finest gemstones, the Faberg\u00e9 Imperial collection celebrates rhythms of the seasons. Exceptional white diamond, pearl and coloured gemstone pieces demonstrate the superlative Faberg\u00e9 hand artisanship.\nImage courtesy of The Royal Collection\nThe Basket of Flowers Egg\nImperial Easter egg, basket-shaped, silver-gilt and oyster guilloch\u00e9 enamel mounted with rose diamond trellis and oval handle with four bows, blue enamel splayed base with rose diamond trellis. Egg contains wild flowers, leaves and husks of enamel on gold. The Tsarina kept the egg in her study at the Winter Palace. Each of the 50 Imperial Easter Eggs made by Faberg\u00e9 was unique, its design and execution of the highest possible standard using the finest raw materials. The bouquet of wild spring flowers would have particularly appealed to Tsarina Alexandra, who owned several of Faberg\u00e9\u2019s flower studies.\nIn Bloom\nIntroducing two limited-edition eggs to our objet d\u2019art collection, which pay homage to our rich heritage, fusing the iconic egg with the iconic flower studies for which Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 was renowned. The Faberg\u00e9 Wild Strawberry Egg and Faberg\u00e9 Water Lily Egg are each destined to become future heirlooms and - limited to just 10 numbered editions per design - are collectors\u2019 pieces which truly celebrate the beauty of nature and the past, present, and future of Faberg\u00e9.\nThe Peacock Egg\nThe Peacock Egg features a transparent egg, placed horizontally, both its halves carved from rock crystal, each set into a heavy mount with a clasp. One half is inscribed with the monogram of Maria Fedorovna, the other with the year 1908. Inside, a peacock in multi-color enamel is poised amid the branches of a golden tree, strewn with flowers of precious stones and enamel. The mechanical bird can turn its head and spread its tailfeathers.\nPeacock Watch\nThe Compliqu\u00e9e Haute Horlogerie collection upholds Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9\u2019s tradition of surprise and meticulous execution with a new and spectacular time display, which won the prestigious 2015 Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve (GPHG) \u2013 the Swiss watchmaking industry\u2019s highest honour \u2013 in the \u2018High-Mechanical\u2019 category. The highly original display of the collection features a fan at the heart of the watch, a movement exclusively developed for Faberg\u00e9 by Agenhor Manufacture. It thus perpetuates the ingenious and freethinking spirit of Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9; the display in the Compliqu\u00e9e Peacock timepiece pays homage to the famous \u201cPeacock Egg\u201d of 1908."

      "text": "Faberg\u00e9, the jeweller famed for its imperial Russian Easter eggs, has been sold to a technology investor in a $50m (\u00a337m) deal.\nGemfields, which mines coloured gemstones in Africa, has agreed to sell Faberg\u00e9 to SMG Capital, a US investment company controlled by the tech backer Sergei Mosunov.\nThe struggling miner, which bought Faberg\u00e9 in 2013 for $142m from the private equity company Pallinghurst, put the company up for sale in December, when political unrest in Mozambique prompted it to temporarily freeze operations at its ruby mine.\nFaberg\u00e9, which was founded in 1842 and taken over and transformed by Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 in 1882, is one of the most renowned jewellers in the world but has come under pressure amid a downturn in the luxury goods market. It made revenues of $13.4m in 2024, down from $15.7m the previous year.\nSean Gilbertson, the chief executive of Gemfields, described the deal as \u201cthe end of an era\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cFaberg\u00e9 has played a key role in raising the profile of the coloured gemstones mined by Gemfields and we will certainly miss its marketing leverage and star power.\u201d\nMosunov, a venture capitalist and startup investor, said it was a \u201cgreat honour \u2026 to become the custodian of such an outstanding and globally recognised brand\u201d. Mosunov is a Russian national based in the UK.\n\u201cFaberg\u00e9\u2019s unique heritage, with ties to Russia, England, France and the USA, opens significant opportunities for further strengthening its position in the global luxury market and expanding its international presence,\u201d he said.\nFaberg\u00e9 is best known for the ornate eggs it made for the Russian royal family before the 1917 revolution. The jeweller began making Imperial Easter eggs when tsar Alexander III first commissioned them as a present for his wife, tsarina Maria Feodorovna, in 1885. There are 50 Imperial Easter eggs in collections around the world.\nDuring the Russian revolution, the Bolsheviks seized the Faberg\u00e9 workshops and closed down production. The family fled across Europe to Germany, Finland and Switzerland.\nThe brand was revived under various iterations over the course of the 20th century, and was sold for $180m in 1984. Three years later it acquired the Elizabeth Arden brand for $700m. In 1989, the consumer goods group Unilever then bought Faberg\u00e9 for $1.55bn. The brand was relaunched by the Faberg\u00e9 family in 2009.\nWhile Faberg\u00e9 is best known for its multimillion-pound Easter eggs, with a collection valued as high as \u00a352m when auctioned in 2004, it has a number of other highly valued collector ranges, as well as lines of jewellery and watches.\nThis spring the Castle Howard Faberg\u00e9 range was put up for auction, an array of animal models carved from stones such as topaz and nephrite.\nGemfields said it would use proceeds from the sale to help fund its mining operations in Mozambique and Zambia.\nShares in the miner, which is dual listed on London\u2019s junior stock market and Johannesburg\u2019s exchange, have fallen by about 70% from their peak in 2023, as the miner has struggled against oversupply in the emerald market. In June the company told investors that the opening of a new mine in Mozambique had been delayed because of problems around illegal mining and work permits."

      "text": "ZOOM Faberg\u00e9 Eggs - Coronation Egg\n1897 Easter gift to Alexandra, workmasters Michael Perchin & Henrik Wigstr\u00f6m\nCoronation Egg (1897)\nMaterials -\nEgg: varicolored gold, translucent lime-yellow and opaque black and blue enamel, diamonds, off-white velvet lining\nCoach: gold, platinum, strawberry red enamel, diamonds, rubies, rock crystal\nDimensions -\nHeight of egg: 127 mm. (5 in.)\nLength of miniature: 93 mm. (3 11/16 in.)\nOwner: The Link of Times Foundation Collection, Russia\nThe Coronation Egg and its coach are probably the most recognized of the creations of the House of Faberg\u00e9. This superb red gold egg, enameled translucent lime-yellow on a guilloche sunburst field, is enclosed by a green-gold laurel leaf trellis-work cage, mounted at each intersection by a yellow-gold Imperial double-headed eagle, enameled opaque black and set with a diamond. A large portrait diamond is set at the top of the egg, within a cluster of ten brilliant diamonds. Through the table of this stone, the monogram of the tsarina can be seen, the crowned A described in rose-cut diamonds and the Russian F in cabochon rubies set in an opaque enamel plaque.\nThe surprise concealed inside this elaborate shell is an exact replica of the Imperial coach used to carry Alexandra Fedorovna to her coronation in Moscow in May 1896. In yellow gold and translucent strawberry-colored enamel, the coach is surmounted by the Imperial crown in rose-cut diamonds and six double-headed eagles on the roof; it is fitted with engraved rock crystal windows and platinum tires and is decorated with a diamond-set trellis in gold and an Imperial eagle in diamonds on either door. It is perfectly articulated in all its parts, even to the two steps that may be let down when the doors are opened, and the whole chassis is correctly slung. The interior is enameled with pale blue curtains behind the upholstered seats and footstool, and has a daintily painted ceiling with a turquoise-blue sconce and hook set in the center. The hook may have once held a tiny egg-shaped, briolette-cut emerald pendant, which is now missing along with the original display case and the egg\u2019s stand.\nThe Coronation egg commemorates the coronation of Nicholas II and Alexandra Fedorovna in Moscow\u2019s Uspenski Cathedral on a cloudless, blue day, May 26 (OS), 1896. The celebrations, however, turned to disaster the next day, when hundreds died and thousands were injured in a stampede for free beer and coronation souvenirs at Moscow\u2019s Khodynka Meadow.\nGeorge Stein, who made the exact replica of the coronation coach, spent 15 months \u2013 sometimes working 16 hours day \u2013 to complete it. He used the money he received for making the miniature coach to buy a less grand form of transport\u2014a bicycle!\nThe egg has had only a few owners:\n- Easter 1897 - presented to Alexandra Fedorovna and housed in Alexandra Fedorovna\u2019s study at the Winter Palace\n- ca. 1927 sold by the Antikvariat, Moscow, to Emanuel Snowman of Wartski, London\n- 1934 bought by Charles Parsons, London\n- 1945 bought back by Wartski\n- 1979 sold by Wartski, with the 1898 Lilies of the Valley Egg, for $2,160,000 to Forbes Magazine Collection, New York\n- 2004 returned to Russia, its country of origin, after a private sale for an undisclosed sum to Viktor Vekselberg"

      "text": "Related Content\nPress Release\nSpeech\nWashington\nThis is archived content from the U.S. Department of Justice website. The information here may be outdated and links may no longer function. Please contact webmaster@usdoj.gov if you have any questions about the archive site.\nNote: Footage of the seizure is available here. View the statement from the Attorney General on today's seizure here.\nSpanish law enforcement today executed a Spanish court order freezing the Motor Yacht (M/Y) Tango (the Tango), a 255-foot luxury yacht owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. Spanish authorities acted pursuant to a request from the U.S. Department of Justice for assistance following the issuance of a seizure warrant, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which alleged that the Tango was subject to forfeiture based on violation of U.S. bank fraud, money laundering, and sanction statutes. Separately, seizure warrants obtained in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia target approximately $625,000 associated with sanctioned parties held at nine U.S. financial institutions. Those seizures are based on sanctions violations by several Russian specially designated nationals.\nAccording to documents filed in this case, the U.S. investigation alleges that Vekselberg bought the Tango in 2011 and has owned it continuously since that time. It further alleges that Vekselberg used shell companies to obfuscate his interest in the Tango to avoid bank oversight into U.S. dollar transactions related thereto. Additionally, after Vekselberg was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department on April 6, 2018, the warrant alleges that Vekselberg and those working on his behalf continued to make U.S. dollar payments through U.S. banks for the support and maintenance of the Tango and its owners, including a payment for a December 2020 stay at a luxury water villa resort in the Maldives and mooring fees for the yacht. Vekselberg had an interest in these payments and therefore a license was required from the Treasury Department, which was not obtained.\n\u201cToday marks our taskforce\u2019s first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \u201cTogether, with our international partners, we will do everything possible to hold accountable any individual whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s action makes clear that corrupt Russian oligarchs cannot evade sanctions to live a life of luxury as innocent Ukrainians are suffering,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. \u201cToday the Department of Justice delivers on our commitment to hold accountable those whose criminal activity strengthens the Russian government as it continues to wage its unjust war in Ukraine. That commitment is one we are not finished honoring.\u201d\n\u201cToday we announce another example of the FBI using our worldwide presence and partnerships, as well as our expertise and experience, to track and seize illicit money and assets, to counter threats to our safety and national security,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cWe will continue to use every lawful tool to go after designated Russian oligarchs' assets \u2013 however and wherever they hide them.\u201d\nThe seizure was coordinated through the Justice Department\u2019s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export restrictions, and economic countermeasures that the United States has imposed, along with its allies and partners, in response to Russia\u2019s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2 and run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will leverage all the Department\u2019s tools and authorities against efforts to evade or undermine the economic actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression.\n\u201cThe seizure of this luxury yacht demonstrates our determination to hold accountable those who support Vladimir Putin\u2019s unwarranted invasion of another sovereign nation,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia. \u201cWe will continue to use every tool to enforce the sanctions aimed at Putin\u2019s regime and the oligarchs who support it. Working with our federal and international partners, we will be unflagging in our efforts to bring to justice those who violate these sanctions, and to seize assets where appropriate and lawful.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s seizure of Viktor Vekselberg\u2019s yacht, the Tango, in Spain is the result of an unprecedented multinational effort to enforce U.S. sanctions targeting those elites who have enabled Russia\u2019s unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine,\u201d said Director Andrew Adams of Task Force KleptoCapture. \u201cFor those who have tied their fortunes to a brutal and lawless regime, today\u2019s action is a message that those nations dedicated to the rule of law are equally dedicated to separating the oligarchs from their tainted luxuries. This seizure is only the beginning of the Task Force\u2019s work in this global effort to punish those who have and continue to support tyranny for financial gain.\u201d\n\u201cThe FBI will continue to work with its partners to protect the integrity of the banking system and support the enforcement of sanctions programs,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Michael F. Paul of the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Field Office. \u201cFBI agents and analysts, regardless of where they are assigned around the world, will work tirelessly to ensure those who attempt to evade sanctions are held accountable.\u201d\n\u201cThe Russian invasion of Ukraine was an unprovoked act of aggression that has targeted the lives and well-being of millions of people and threatened international security,\u201d said Acting Special Agent in Charge Ricky J. Patel of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York. \u201cFor decades, the Putin regime has been supported by a group of Russian oligarchs that abused their power for private gain to amass untold riches. As DHS\u2019s investigative arm, HSI stands at the forefront of combatting global networks that seek to violate U.S. law and exploit our nation\u2019s financial systems. Working with our partners at the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI, we will hold Putin\u2019s oligarchs accountable and deny them the lavish lifestyles they cherish.\u201d\nUpon receipt of a request from the United States pursuant to a bi-lateral treaty for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, the Spanish central authority for mutual legal assistance forwarded the request to a Spanish prosecutor, who obtained a freezing order from a Spanish court. The order was executed by Spain\u2019s Guardia Civil on April 4.\nThe Tango, International Maritime Organization number 1010703, is believed to be worth approximately $90 million or more. The yacht is now in Mallorca.\nThe burden to prove forfeitability in a forfeiture proceeding is upon the government.\nThe matter of the Tango is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis Field Office with assistance from the FBI Legal Attach\u00e9 Office in Madrid and the HSI New York Field Office.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Karen P. Seifert for the District of Columbia and Paralegal Brian Rickers and Legal Assistant Jessica McCormick for the District of Columbia are handling the seizure. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in working with the Spanish authorities, as well as the Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS)."
