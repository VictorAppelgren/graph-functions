      "feedback": "**Edit checklist – keep the focus on the dollar (Z7O1DCHS7) and tighten any drift into equity‑market or labor‑market detail.**\n\n1. **Sentence on equity‑market concentration**  \n   *Current:* “Equity‑market concentration adds an additional layer of risk. The S&P 500’s top ten stocks now account for 40 % of the index, an all‑time high, and a weak earnings cycle in tech could trigger a sharp market pullback (FAN5RYW6T).”  \n   *Action:* Keep the first clause (it links to dollar via risk‑off flight) but delete the second clause about the 40 % figure and tech earnings. If you want to retain the tech‑earnings point, add a closing phrase that explicitly ties it back to dollar weakness, e.g., “…which would amplify risk‑off sentiment and further weaken the dollar.”  \n\n2. **Sentence on labor‑market and Fed‑cut expectations**  \n   *Current:* “Moreover, the labor market’s weak growth has already prompted expectations of a September Fed cut, but the Fed may only lift stocks if the labor market holds, implying that a weak labor market could simultaneously support a dollar decline and a stock market pullback (FAN5RYW6T).”  \n   *Action:* Trim to “Weak labor‑market growth has pushed September Fed‑cut expectations, which, if realized, would support a dollar decline (FAN5RYW6T).” This keeps the dollar link and removes the stock‑market side.  \n\n3. **Key‑risk bullet (3)**  \n   *Current:* “(3) a sharp equity‑market sell‑off driven by tech earnings weakness, which would amplify risk‑off sentiment and further weaken the dollar (FAN5RYW6T)(Z7O1DCHS7).”  \n   *Action:* Re‑phrase to “(3) a sharp equity‑market sell‑off driven by tech earnings weakness, which would amplify risk‑off sentiment and further weaken the dollar (FAN5RYW6T).” The dollar reference is already present; just ensure the sentence ends with the dollar clause.  \n\n4. **General tightening**  \n   *Action:* Remove any redundant phrases that do not add dollar‑specific insight (e.g., “the dollar index has already fallen 10 % year‑to‑date” can be shortened to “the dollar index is down 10 % YTD”).  \n   *Action:* Ensure every sentence that references a non‑dollar metric (e.g., yield‑curve steepening, euro, yen) ends with a clear dollar implication (e.g., “which weakens the dollar relative to risk‑free assets”).  \n\nAfter these edits the draft will remain strictly dollar‑centric, with all supporting evidence (Z7O1DCHS7, FAN5RYW6T) explicitly linked to dollar movements.",
