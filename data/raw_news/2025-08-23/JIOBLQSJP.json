  "description": "Multiple postal services around Europe say they are suspending the shipment of many packages to the United States amid a lack of clarity over new import duties.",
  "content": "The end of an exemption on tariff duties for low-value packages coming into the United States is causing multiple international postal services to pause shipping to the U.S. as they await more clarity on the rule.\n\nThe exemption, known as the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, allows packages worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. A total of 1.36 billion packages were sent in 2024 under this exemption, for goods worth $64.6 billion, according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agency.\n\nIt is set to expire Friday. On Saturday, postal services around Europe announced that they are suspending the shipment of many packages to the United States amid confusion over new import duties.\n\nPostal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Italy said they will stop shipping most merchandise to the U.S. effective immediately. France and Austria will follow Monday.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Royal Mail said it would halt shipments to the U.S. on Tuesday to allow time for those packages to arrive before duties kick in. Items originating in the U.K. worth over $100 \u2014 including gifts to friends and family \u2014 will incur a 10% duty, it said.\n\n\u201cKey questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,\u201d DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, said in a statement.\n\nThe company said that starting Saturday it \u201cwill no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S.\u201d\n\nA trade framework agreed on by the U.S. and the European Union last month set a 15% tariff on the vast majority of products shipped from the EU. Packages under $800 will now also be subject to the tariff.\n\nThe U.S. duty-free exemption for goods originating from China ended in May as part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value Chinese goods. The exemption is being extended to shipments from around the world.\n\nMany European postal services say they are pausing deliveries now because they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the U.S. before Aug. 29. They cite ambiguity about what kind of goods are covered by the new rules, and the lack of time to process their implications.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of different instructions from US authorities ... Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23. Mail shipments not containing merchandise will continue to be accepted,\u201d Poste Italiane said in a statement Friday.\n\nShipping by services such as DHL Express remains possible, it added.\n\nBjorn Bergman, head of PostNord\u2019s Group Brand and Communication, said the pause was \u201cunfortunate but necessary to ensure full compliance of the newly implemented rules.\u201d\n\nIn the Netherlands, PostNL spokesperson Wout Witteveen said the Trump administration is pressing ahead with the new duties despite U.S. authorities lacking a system to collect them. He said that PostNL is working closely with its U.S. counterparts to find a solution.\n\n\u201cIf you have something to send to America, you should do it today,\u201d Witteveen told the Associated Press.\n\nAustrian Post, Austria\u2019s leading logistics and postal service provider, stated that the last acceptance of commercial shipments to the U.S., including Puerto Rico, will take place Tuesday.\n\nFrance\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time for the French postal service to prepare for new customs procedures.\n\n\u2033Despite discussions with U.S. customs services, no time was provided to postal operators to re-organize and assure the necessary computer updates to conform to the new rules,\u2033 it said in a statement.\n\nPostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no solution can be found by Aug. 29, all its members will probably follow suit.\n\nNellas and Anderson write for the Associated Press and reported from Athens and New York, respectively.

      "text": "Trump injects a new dose of uncertainty in tariffs as he pushes start date to Aug. 7\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For weeks, President Trump was promising the world economy would change on Friday with his new tariffs in place. It was an ironclad deadline, administration officials assured the public.\nBut when Trump signed the order Thursday night imposing new tariffs, the start date of the punishing import taxes was pushed back seven days so the tariff schedule could be updated. The change in tariffs on 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands was potentially welcome news to countries that had not yet reached a deal with the U.S. It also injected a new dose of uncertainty for consumers and businesses still wondering what\u2019s going to happen and when.\nTrump told NBC News in a Thursday night interview the tariffs process was going \u201cvery well, very smooth.\u201d But even as the Republican president insisted these new rates would stay in place, he added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that somebody doesn\u2019t come along in four weeks and say we can make some kind of a deal.\u201d\nTrump has promised that his tax increases on the nearly $3 trillion in goods imported to the United States will usher in newfound wealth, launch a cavalcade of new factory jobs, reduce the budget deficits and, simply, get other countries to treat America with more respect.\nThe vast tariffs risk jeopardizing America\u2019s global standing as allies feel forced into unfriendly deals. As taxes on the raw materials used by U.S. factories and basic goods, the tariffs also threaten to create new inflationary pressures and hamper economic growth \u2014 concerns the Trump White House has dismissed.\nQuestions swirl around the tariffs despite Trump\u2019s eagerness\nAs the clock ticked toward Trump\u2019s self-imposed deadline, few things seemed to be settled other than the president\u2019s determination to levy the taxes he has talked about for decades. The very legality of the tariffs remains an open question as a U.S. appeals court on Thursday heard arguments on whether Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an \u201cemergency\u201d under a 1977 law to charge the tariffs, allowing him to avoid congressional approval.\nTrump was ebullient as much of the world awaited what he would do.\n\u201cTariffs are making America GREAT & RICH Again,\u201d he said Thursday morning on Truth Social.\nOthers saw a policy carelessly constructed by the U.S. president, one that could impose harms gradually over time that would erode America\u2019s power and prosperity.\n\u201cThe only things we\u2019ll know for sure on Friday morning are that growth-sapping U.S. import taxes will be historically high and complex, and that, because these deals are so vague and unfinished, policy uncertainty will remain very elevated,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, a vice president of economics at the Cato Institute. \u201cThe rest is very much TBD.\u201d\nThe new tariffs build off ones announced in the spring\nTrump initially imposed the Friday deadline after his previous \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April resulted in a stock market panic. His unusually high tariff rates announced then led to recession fears, prompting Trump to impose a 90-day negotiating period. When he was unable to create enough trade deals with other countries, he extended the timeline and sent out letters to world leaders that simply listed rates, prompting a slew of hasty agreements.\nSwiss imports will now be taxed at a higher rate, 39%, than the 31% Trump threatened in April, while Liechtenstein saw its rate slashed from 37% to 15%. Countries not listed in the Thursday night order would be charged a baseline 10% tariff.\nTrump negotiated trade frameworks over the past few weeks with the EU, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 allowing the president to claim victories as other nations sought to limit his threat of charging even higher tariff rates. He said Thursday there were agreements with other countries, but he declined to name them.\nAsked on Friday if countries were happy with the rates set by Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said: \u201cA lot of them are.\u201d\nThursday began with a palpable sense of tension\nThe EU was awaiting a written agreement on its 15% tariff deal. Switzerland and Norway were among the dozens of countries that did not know what their tariff rate would be, while Trump agreed after a Thursday morning phone call to keep Mexico\u2019s tariffs at 25% for a 90-day negotiating period. The president separately on Thursday amended an order to raise certain tariffs on Canada to 35%.\nEuropean leaders face blowback for seeming to cave to Trump, even as they insist that this is merely the start of talks and stress the importance of maintaining America\u2019s support of Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has already indicated that his country can no longer rely on the U.S. as an ally, and Trump declined to talk to him on Thursday.\nIndia, with its 25% tariff announced Wednesday by Trump, may no longer benefit as much from efforts to pivot manufacturing out of China. While the Trump administration has sought to challenge China\u2019s manufacturing dominance, it is separately in extended trade talks with that country, which faces a 30% tariff and is charging a 10% retaliatory rate on the U.S.\nMajor companies came into the week warning that tariffs would begin to squeeze them financially. Ford Motor Co. said it anticipated a net $2 billion hit to earnings this year from tariffs. French skincare company Yon-Ka is warning of job freezes, scaled-back investment and rising prices.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s new tariffs will survive a legal challenge\nFederal judges sounded skeptical Thursday about Trump\u2019s use of a 1977 law to declare the long-standing U.S. trade deficit a national emergency that justifies tariffs on almost every country.\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking for an unbounded authority,\u201d Judge Todd Hughes of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit told a Justice Department lawyer representing the administration.\nThe judges didn\u2019t immediately rule, and the case is expected to reach the Supreme Court eventually.\nThe Trump White House has pointed to the increase in federal revenues as a sign that the tariffs will reduce the budget deficit, with $127 billion in customs and duties collected so far this year \u2014 about $70 billion more than last year.\nNew tariffs threaten to raise inflation rates\nThere are not yet signs that tariffs will lead to more domestic manufacturing jobs, and Friday\u2019s employment report showed the U.S. economy now has 37,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than it did in April.\nOn Thursday, one crucial measure of inflation, known as the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that prices have climbed 2.6% over the 12 months that ended in June, a sign that inflation may be accelerating as the tariffs flow through the economy.\nThe prospect of higher inflation from the tariffs has caused the Federal Reserve to hold off on additional cuts to its benchmark rates, a point of frustration for Trump, who on Truth Social, called Fed Chair Jerome Powell a \u201cTOTAL LOSER.\u201d\nBut before Trump\u2019s tariffs, Powell seemed to suggest that the tariffs had put the U.S. economy and much of the world into a state of unknowns.\n\u201cThere are many uncertainties left to resolve,\u201d Powell told reporters Wednesday. \u201cSo, yes, we are learning more and more. It doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re very close to the end of that process. And that\u2019s not for us to judge, but it does \u2014 it feels like there\u2019s much more to come.\u201d\nBoak writes for the Associated Press. AP writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report."

      "text": "The U.S. and EU release a bare-bones account of their trade deal, but it\u2019s a work in progress\n- Share via\nAmerican and European Union officials released a bare-bones account Thursday of their trade deal that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States, but they left blank key areas such as wine and spirits, as well as steel, and indicated that talks would continue on those and a slew of other important sectors.\nThe two sides said the document was only \u201ca first step in a process that can be further expanded to cover additional areas.\u201d They are dealing with the vast range of goods traded between the two economies in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, involving $2 trillion in annual trans-Atlantic business.\nThe three-and-a-half-page text represents a political commitment and is not legally binding. It contrasts with the typical format for trade agreements, which can be hundreds of pages long and carry legal force.\nThe key provisions are the 15% tariff on most EU goods, a zero rate on U.S. cars and other industrial goods exported to the 27-member EU, and a range of exceptions to the 15% rate for aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, with other sectors to be added for goods crucial to each other\u2019s economies. Those goods would face lower tariffs from before President Trump\u2019s tariff onslaught.\n\u201cThe EU has agreed to open its $20 Trillion market,\u201d Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said on X. \u201cThe second largest in the world behind the great USA.\u201d\nHe said the deal was \u201ca major win for American workers, US industries, and our national security. Tariffs should be one of America\u2019s favorite words.\u201d\nEuropean officials have had to defend the deal against dismay from businesses and member governments at the higher tariffs and criticism that the EU gave away too much. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sold the deal as granting quick relief from the even higher U.S. tariff on EU cars of 27.5% and as opening the way for further negotiations that could exclude more goods from the 15% tariffs. The deal provides that the lower tariff on cars would apply retroactively from Aug. 1 if the EU can introduce legislation to implement its part of the deal by then, which EU officials say they will do.\n\u201cFaced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our member states and industry and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade,\u201d Von der Leyen said. \u201cThis is not the end of the process.\u201d\nThe chief EU trade negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, echoed those sentiments. \u201cThe alternative was a trade war with sky high tariffs ... it builds confidence. It brings stability,\u201d he said.\nEconomists say higher tariffs slow economic growth and will be reflected in higher consumer prices.\nOne category of goods not excluded from tariffs on EU goods was wine and spirits, which had enjoyed zero tariffs on both ends since a 1997 trade deal. Sefcovic said EU officials had not won an exemption \u201cyet\u201d but hoped to in future talks and that \u201cdoors are not closed forever\u201d on that issue.\nThat means American distillers face zero tariffs in Europe the short term, but also the possibility of EU retaliation down the line, said Chris Swonger, president and chief executive of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. \u201cWithout a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits, American distillers do not have the certainty to plan for future export and job growth without the fear of retaliatory tariffs returning,\u201d Swonger said in a statement.\nThe EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including wine and spirits, until Feb. 5, 2026.\nProposals to exempt a certain amount of EU steel imports, known as a tariff rate quota, have been left unresolved pending more talks.\nThe 15% tariff is much higher than tariff levels on both sides from before Trump began imposing his tariffs, when they averaged in the low single digits. The tariffs are paid on the U.S. end, either absorbed by American businesses importing the goods, lowering their profits, or passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices at the cash register.\nThe deal also includes nonbinding EU commitments to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and for EU companies to invest $600 billion in the U.S. In both cases, the money would come from private companies and is based on an assessment by the European Commission on what companies were planning to spend.\nMcNeil, McHugh and Hussein write for the Associated Press."

      "text": "What U.S. consumers can expect from new tariffs on imported goods\n- Share via\nAmerican businesses and consumers soon will have a better idea of how President Trump\u2019s foreign trade agenda might affect them now that the United States has imposed higher tariffs on products from dozens of countries.\nIt\u2019s been nearly 100 years since the nation had an overall import tax rate as high as the one set Thursday. But the individual effect on business costs and consumer prices could vary as much as the tariffs applied to goods of nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, from complicated economies like the European Union to the small African nation of Lesotho.\nExports from a majority of them are getting taxed at 15%. For a handful of countries in Asia, the rate is 19%. Products from the rest are subject to taxes of 20% to 50%. Meanwhile, a 55% tariff on Chinese-made goods is scheduled to take effect next week if a U.S.-China trade deal is not agreed on before then.\nBusinesses that rely on goods imported from India are preparing for a 25% tariff to take effect as President Trump\u2019s trade war with once-strong trade partners continues.\nBusinesses in the U.S. and abroad have been dealing in various ways since February with Trump\u2019s fluctuating tariffs on specific products and countries. Many automakers appeared to have absorbed the costs for now. But recent government data indicated that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June.\nBecause tariffs are a tax on imports, economists have expected U.S. consumers to foot at least part of the bill eventually.\nThe country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president\u2019s earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. That\u2019s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the nonpartisan policy research center.\nThe projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August.\n\u201cRetailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new increased tariffs will significantly raise costs for U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,\u201d Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to the Associated Press.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the tariffs and where U.S. consumers are most likely to notice effects:\nHow we got here\nTrump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.\nThe president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday.\nIn the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump\u2019s first term shields most of those countries\u2019 products from punishing duties.\nThe president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India\u2019s tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration.\nOther duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren\u2019t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs.\nTariffs are already impacting prices\nThe U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased.\nShoppers should be prepared to pay more for clothes and shoes because the combined tariffs \u201cdisproportionately affect clothing and textiles,\u201d according to the Budget Lab at Yale. It estimates that shoe prices will go up 39% temporarily and stay 19% above where they are now. For apparel, the Budget Lab put the comparable figures at 37% and 18%.\nOverall, Americans face an average tax of 18.6% for imported products, the highest rate since 1933, the research center said.\nFood and drink prices will climb\nThe tariffs will almost certainly result in higher food prices, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. The U.S. simply doesn\u2019t make enough of some products, like bananas or coffee, to satisfy demand. Fish, beer and liquor are also likely to get more expensive, the foundation said.\nThe U.S. Wine Trade Alliance and other alcohol industry trade groups sent a letter to Trump that warned a 15% tariff on European wines and spirits could result in more than 25,000 American job losses and cost the industry nearly $2 billion in lost sales.\n\u201cMr. President, we need toasts, not tariffs, as we head into the most important season for our industry,\u201d read the letter dated Wednesday.\nWine distributors and retailers avoided price increases before now by accelerating shipments from France and other EU countries earlier in the year. But with the EU\u2019s tariff rate raised to 15% on Thursday, customers may see European wines costing 30% more in September, U.S. Wine Trade Alliance President Ben Aneff said.\nCar prices hold steady \u2014 so far\nSome automakers already raised prices to counteract tariffs. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump\u2019s trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S.\nFor the most part, automakers waited for details instead of passing on tariff costs to consumers. But that could change.\nGeneral Motors said July 22 that the effect of the tariffs could get more pronounced in the third quarter of the year. GM has estimated the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year.\nToyota reported Thursday a 37% drop in profits in the April-June quarter, cutting its full-year earnings forecasts largely because of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nStill a clouded picture\nEven with so many new tariffs kicking in, the tariff situation remains fluid. Trump\u2019s use of an emergency powers law to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. The case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nMoreover, the tariffs on goods from China haven\u2019t been finalized. Consumers may start seeing more effects when the administration ends a tax exemption for small parcels sent from other countries.\nTrump last week signed an order to suspend the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption that has allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. International e-commerce companies have widely used the rule to avoid paying customs charges.\nTrump withdrew the exemption in early April for goods shipped from China and Hong Kong tariff-free. It is now set to be eliminated for low-value packages from every country Aug. 29.\nD\u2019Innocenzio and Durbin write for the Associated Press.

  "argos_summary": "The U.S. is set to end the de\u2011minimis duty\u2011free exemption for packages under $800, prompting European postal operators\u2014including Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, the UK, and others\u2014to suspend shipments to the United States pending clarification on new tariff rules. The change follows a trade framework that imposes a 15% tariff on most EU goods and extends duties to low\u2011value parcels, raising uncertainty about customs data transmission and duty collection. While the U.S. administration delays the start date of broader tariffs to August 7, the pause reflects confusion over which goods are covered and how duties will be enforced. Postal services warn that without clear guidance, shipments may be delayed or face additional charges, and some operators have already halted commercial deliveries to the U.S. as of late August. The move underscores the broader tension between U.S. trade policy and European logistics providers amid ongoing tariff negotiations.",
