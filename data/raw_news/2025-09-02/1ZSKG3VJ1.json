  "description": "More than 360 people, including 130 children, have died from hunger since the start of Israel\u2019s genocidal war on Gaza.",
  "content": "More than 360 people, including 130 children, have died from hunger since the start of Israel\u2019s genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nA total of 185 people in Gaza died \u201cdue to malnutrition\u201d in August, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, as an additional 13 people, including three children, have died in 24 hours since then as the catastrophic effects of Israeli-induced famine in the enclave worsen.\n\nThe statement issued on Tuesday said more than 83 people, including 15 children, had died since the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a United Nations-backed global hunger-monitoring system, declared last month that parts of Gaza were undergoing a full-blown famine.\n\nThe Health Ministry also said 43,000 children below the age of five were suffering from malnutrition along with more than 55,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women. Two-thirds of pregnant women were suffering from anaemia, the highest rate in years, it added. Mothers and newborns are the most at risk from malnutrition.\n\nThe total number of hunger-related deaths in the besieged enclave now stands at 361, including 130 children, since the start of Israel\u2019s genocidal war on Gaza on October 7, 2023.\n\nIsrael has killed at least 63,557 people in Gaza and wounded 160,660 during the war.\n\nThe IPC declared on August 22 that 514,000 people in the Gaza Strip, close to a quarter of the enclave\u2019s population, are experiencing famine. It expected the number to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\n\nThe IPC made its declaration after more than 22 months of war, during which Israeli forces have destroyed medical facilities, schools, infrastructure and bakeries; blocked the entry of aid into the besieged Strip; and targeted and killed Palestinians seeking food aid.\n\nThis is the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to Deir el-Balah in central Gaza and Khan Younis in the south by the end of this month.\n\nAfter the IPC\u2019s declaration, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the famine a \u201cman-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself\u201d.\n\nGuterres said Israel had \u201cunequivocal obligations\u201d under international law as an occupying power to ensure food and medical supplies enter Gaza.\n\nHumanitarian organisations have demanded action. For its part, Israel rejected the findings, saying there was no famine in Gaza despite the IPC\u2019s overwhelming evidence.\n\nAt least 54 Palestinians, including several aid seekers, were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza since dawn on Tuesday, Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum reported at midday from Deir el-Balah. Israeli attacks are now focused on Gaza City as the Israeli army bombs it and tries to forcibly displace its residents to the southern part of the enclave.\n\n\u201cCivilians on the ground are bearing the brunt. There are still hundreds of thousands of families in Gaza City,\u201d Azzoum said. \u201cThey refuse to leave because they know that there are no safe spaces in central and southern Gaza and they would rather stay close to their communities and what\u2019s left of their houses.\u201d\n\nOnce teeming and crowded with residential buildings, Gaza City had been home to one million Palestinians, nearly half of Gaza\u2019s population, but it is now a landscape of rubble.\n\nThe world\u2019s top genocide scholars formally declared that Israel\u2019s war on Gaza meets the legal definition of genocide, marking a landmark intervention from leading experts in the field of international law.\n\nThe International Association of Genocide Scholars, a 500-member body of academics founded in 1994, passed a resolution on Monday stating that Israel\u2019s policies and actions in Gaza fulfil the definition of genocide set out in the 1948 UN Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.",

      "text": "Israeli soldiers \u2018ordered\u2019 to shoot unarmed Gaza aid seekers: Report\nThe Israeli news outlet, Haaretz, reports that soldiers operating near food aid sites in Gaza have deliberately fired upon Palestinians.\nIsraeli soldiers have deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being \u201cordered\u201d to do so by their commanders, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports.\nIsrael ordered an investigation into possible war crimes over the allegations by some soldiers that it revealed on Friday, Haaretz said.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsWar and Waste in Gaza\nIn an age of abundance and ceasefires, Gaza starves, and the war won\u2019t stop\nAt least 549 Palestinians have been killed and 4,066 injured while waiting for food aid distributed at sites run by the Israeli-and United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the Gaza Government Media Office said on Thursday. The GHF has been a source of widespread criticism since its establishment in May.\nAccording to the Haaretz report, which quoted unnamed Israeli soldiers, troops were told to fire at the crowds of Palestinians and use unnecessary lethal force against people who appeared to pose no threat.\n\u201cWe fired machineguns from tanks and threw grenades,\u201d one soldier told Haaretz. \u201cThere was one incident where a group of civilians was hit while advancing under the cover of fog.\u201d\nIn another instance, a soldier said that where they were stationed in Gaza, between \u201cone and five people were killed every day\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a killing field,\u201d that soldier said.\nMethod of \u2018control\u2019\nThe Israeli army \u201cstrongly rejected\u201d the accusations in the report, according to a military statement published on Telegram. \u201cAny allegation of a deviation from the law or [military] directives will be thoroughly examined, and further action will be taken as necessary. The allegations of deliberate fire toward civilians presented in the article are not recognized in the field,\u201d it said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz condemned the report, calling it \u201cblood libel\u201d on the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), according to a statement carried by The Times of Israel news outlet.\n\u201cThe IDF operates under difficult conditions against a terrorist enemy that operates from within the civilian population,\u201d they said. \u201cIDF soldiers receive clear orders to avoid harming innocent civilians, and they act accordingly.\u201d\nAccording to Haaretz, the Military Advocate General has told the army\u2019s General Staff\u2019s Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism, which reviews incidents involving potential violations of the laws of war, to investigate suspected war crimes at these aid sites.\nOne of the authors of the report, Nir Hasson, told Al Jazeera that the Israeli directive to fire on civilians is part of a method to \u201ccontrol\u201d the aid seekers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a practice of \u2026 controlling the crowd by fire, like if you wanted the crowd to run off [from] a place, you shoot them at them, even though you know they are unarmed \u2026 You use fire to move people from one point to another,\u201d he said from West Jerusalem.\nWhile the journalist and his colleagues do not know the name of the commander who might have issued such a directive, Hasson said that he would likely hold a position high up in the army.\nDespite this practice at these sites, most Israelis and the army\u2019s troops still believe the war on Gaza is just, even while some cracks are emerging in this understanding, the journalist said.\n\u201c[There are] more and more people who are asking themselves if this war is necessary, but also what is the humanitarian price the Gazan population is [paying] for this war,\u201d he said.\n\u2018A death trap\u2019\n\u201cWar crimes\u201d are taking place at GHF aid distribution sites in Gaza, the enclave\u2019s Government Media Office said in a statement, referencing \u201cthe shocking confessions\u201d published by Haaretz.\n\u201cThe report\u2019s direct military orders to fire on unarmed civilians who pose no threat, and the use of heavy machine guns, artillery, and shells against peaceful gatherings waiting for food, are further evidence that the Israeli occupation army is pursuing a systematic policy of genocide under the false guise of \u2018relief\u2019,\u201d the statement added.\nReporting from Amman, Jordan, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hamdah Salhut said the Haaretz report is \u201cshocking\u201d.\n\u201cPeople in Gaza have said these distribution centres have now become a death trap for Palestinians,\u201d Salhut said. \u201cAid groups have said that Palestinians are left with no choice \u2013 to either starve to death, or die seeking the very little food that is offered in the distribution centres run by the GHF.\u201d\nThe GHF operates four sites in Gaza \u2013 one in the centre and three in the south \u2013 and attacks on aid seekers have only increased since an Israeli blockade was lifted and the Foundation started distributing food at the end of May.\nOn Friday, medics said six people were killed by gunfire as they tried to get food in southern Gaza.\nThe GHF has come under intense condemnation by aid groups, including the United Nations, for its \u201cweaponisation\u201d of vital items.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a report of that nature to acknowledge that there have been massive violations of international law [in Gaza],\u201d UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in response to a question from Al Jazeera about the Haaretz report. \u201cAnd when there is a violation of international law, there must be accountability,\u201d he added at a press conference in New York.\nElsewhere on Friday, medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials, MSF, called the GHF\u2019s aid distribution sites \u201cslaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid\u201d.\nSince Israel began its war on Gaza in October 2023, at least 56,331 people have been killed, with 132,632 wounded in Israeli attacks, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry reported."

It means mothers unable to breastfeed because they, too, are starving,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\u201cNo woman should be forced to give birth in famine conditions. No child should begin life starving. Every day of inaction condemns more mothers and newborns to suffering.\u201d\nUNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell repeatedly warned of \u201cunmistakable\u201d signs of spreading malnutrition: \u201cchildren with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat; babies dying from hunger and preventable disease; parents arriving at clinics with nothing to feed their children\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no time to lose.

      "text": "What has led to a famine being confirmed in Gaza?\nThe UN-backed IPC has found that Gaza now faces famine after 22 months of Israel\u2019s war on the Palestinian territory.\nA United Nations-backed global hunger monitor has determined that famine is now occurring in Gaza City and its surrounding area.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) had previously warned that Gaza was on the verge of famine, but now says for the first time that the events of the past few months \u2013 including a new Israeli offensive, increased displacement and weeks of total Israeli blockade of the territory \u2013 have made famine a reality in Gaza.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 itemsNetanyahu approves Gaza City seizure despite ordering truce talks to resume\nIsraeli data shows 83 percent of Gaza war dead are civilians: Report\nThe IPC experts warn that famine will spread to other areas of Gaza if nothing is done to stop Israel\u2019s war and ramp up humanitarian aid. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nWhat were the main findings of the report?\nThe main finding is that famine is no longer a threat to Gaza \u2013 it is now a reality. The IPC says that more than 500,000 people in the Gaza Strip now face \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d, the highest level in its food insecurity classification, \u201ccharacterised by starvation, destitution and death\u201d.\nIn the Gaza Governorate, which includes Gaza City, the IPC found that 30 percent of the population is facing catastrophic conditions, with 50 percent facing an \u201cemergency\u201d, the level below. Conditions in North Gaza governorate are believed to be \u201cas severe \u2013 or worse \u2013 than in Gaza Governorate\u201d, but the IPC is unable to classify the area because of limited data.\nThe IPC also projects that famine will also be present in Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis governorates by the end of September. The IPC already determines that 25 and 20 percent of the population in those governorates respectively, are already classified as being in a level 5 catastrophe.\nIt also projects that 132,000 children between five and six years of age will suffer from acute malnutrition before June of next year, as well as 55,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women and 25,000 infants needing urgent nutrition support.\nRafah, the southernmost governorate in Gaza, was not analysed by the IPC because it has been largely depopulated of Palestinians as a result of Israeli military operations.\nHow did the IPC conclude that a famine has begun in Gaza?\nThe IPC has a five-stage food insecurity classification, with \u201ccatastrophe\u201d the worst. A catastrophe is classified as when \u201chouseholds experience an extreme lack of food and/or cannot meet other basic needs even after full employment of coping strategies\u201d.\nIn a level 5 catastrophe, \u201cstarvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition are evident\u201d.\nHowever, a famine classification is separate from this. For a \u201cfamine with reasonable evidence\u201d to be declared, as it now has in Gaza, there must be clear evidence that two of three thresholds for acute food insecurity, acute malnutrition and mortality have been reached. The thresholds are that at least 20 percent of households \u201chave an extreme lack of food and face starvation and destitution\u201d, that acute malnutrition in children under five affects 30 percent or more, and that there are at least two deaths per 10,000 per day as a result of food insecurity.\nWhat does the IPC say has caused the famine in Gaza?\nThe IPC blames four factors it says are \u201cman-made\u201d: conflict, displacement, restricted access, and food system collapse.\nIsrael\u2019s war in Gaza has already killed more than 62,000 Palestinians in the 22 months since it began. The IPC points out that fatalities and injuries rose dramatically in July, with an average of 119 deaths a day, nearly double the average of the previous month.\nIsrael\u2019s continued offensives have led to many rounds of displacement for Gaza\u2019s population \u2013 with the IPC reporting that 1.9 million people have been displaced more than once since the start of the war. The constant moving and lack of safe accommodation have contributed to the deterioration of Gaza\u2019s food security situation, along with the destruction or inaccessibility of 98 percent of Gaza\u2019s cropland and a ban on fishing activity.\nTo make matters worse, Israel imposed a total blockade on supplies of food and other goods, including water, medicine and fuel, to Gaza in mid-March. It has since lifted the total blockade, but severe restrictions on imports remain.\nWhy is the IPC determination so important?\nThe IPC is recognised as the main tool the international community and the UN use to determine food insecurity levels around the world.\nThe data the IPC provides is vital in heading off future food crises and preventing famine. It can also rally the international community to act early enough to stop famine from taking place, or end a famine once it has started.\nThe process of classifying a famine is complicated and there are multiple stages, with input from a wide array of bodies and groups, before it goes to a Famine Review Committee made up of \u201cleading independent international food security, nutrition and mortality experts\u201d. In the IPC\u2019s words, this committee must \u201cconduct a review to ensure technical rigour and neutrality of the analysis before the results are confirmed and communicated\u201d.\nThe IPC has previously classified famines in Somalia in 2011, in South Sudan in both 2017 and 2020, and in Sudan in 2024.\nWhat has the reaction been?\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the famine a \u201cman-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\u201d.\nGuterres said Israel had \u201cunequivocal obligations\u201d under international law to ensure that food and medical supplies entered Gaza, as it is the occupying power.\n\u201cFamine is not only about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cPeople are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing.\u201d\nHumanitarian organisations are demanding action.\n\u201cToday\u2019s findings must be a wake-up call for the international community,\u201d said David Miliband, the president of the International Rescue Committee. \u201cWithout immediate, unhindered humanitarian access and a ceasefire, more lives will be lost to starvation and disease.\u201d\nFor its part, Israel has rejected the findings, saying there was no famine in Gaza, despite the evidence from the IPC.\n\u201cOver 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets,\u201d Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement."

It called on Israel to halt \u201cdeliberate attacks on civilians, including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other essentials; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement\u201d.\nSergey Vasiliev, professor of international law at the Open University of the Netherlands, told Reuters the declaration reflected a consensus that has taken root in academia. \u201cThis legal assessment has become mainstream within academia, particularly in the field of genocide studies,\u201d he said.\nIsmail al-Thawabta, head of Gaza\u2019s Government Media Office, said the \u201cprestigious scholarly stance reinforces the documented evidence and facts presented before international courts\u201d. He added that the resolution \u201cplaces a legal and moral obligation on the international community to take urgent action to stop the crime, protect civilians, and hold the leaders of the occupation accountable\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s growing legal woes\nThe resolution came as Israel faces a separate case at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, where it is already accused of genocide.\nThe International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nSince Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, more than 63,000 Palestinians have been killed, nearly all residents have been displaced at least once, and most of Gaza\u2019s buildings have been destroyed or damaged.\nA UN-backed global hunger monitor has confirmed the famine in parts of Gaza, a direct result of Israel\u2019s blockade and bombing campaign that has deliberately restricted food, water, and medicine.\nIAGS has previously recognised genocides in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Armenia, and Myanmar. The UN convention it cites defines genocide as crimes committed \u201cwith intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\u201d.\nThe resolution also said Hamas\u2019s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023 constituted international crimes but emphasised that these acts do not justify genocide.\nHundreds of UN human rights staff last week urged High Commissioner Volker Turk to explicitly label Israel\u2019s campaign as genocide, underscoring growing international consensus."

They are trying so hard to find a safer place, but the Israeli army keep attacking every corner in the city,\u201d he said.\nFurther south, in Deir el-Balah, Israel targeted a group of citizens inside Al-Mazra\u2019a School. Later, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital announced the death of Anas Saeed Abu Mughsib, Wafe reported.\nMedical sources said that in total, at least 59 people were killed in Israeli attacks across the Strip on Monday.\n\u2018Man-made famine in the 21st Century\u2019\nAlready displaced by war multiple times, Gaza City residents now face the twin threats of war and famine.\nHunger caused by Israel\u2019s months-long blockade led to the deaths of three infants on Monday. Children account for more than a third of the nearly 350 deaths from hunger and starvation in the enclave since Israel\u2019s war began in October 2023.\nAuthorities say the number of humanitarian aid trucks that Israel has allowed into the Strip in the last month has only met 15 percent of the starving population\u2019s needs.\nYet, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a report in August from the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises, the Integrated Food Security Classification (PIC), that famine was under way in Gaza City, calling it an \u201coutright lie\u201d.\nOn Monday, United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs David Lammy acknowledged the United Nations-backed IPC declaration, saying he was \u201coutraged\u201d by Israel for not allowing enough aid to enter Gaza.\n\u201cThis is not a natural disaster, it\u2019s a man-made famine in the 21st century,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe need a massive, massive humanitarian response to prevent more deaths, crucial NGOs, humanitarians and health workers allowed to operate, and stockpiles of aid on Gaza\u2019s borders released.\u201d\n\u2018Power-hungry ruler\u2019\nMeanwhile, in Israel, mourners gathered for the separate funerals of Idan Shtivi and Ilan Weiss, captives taken from Israel during the October 2023 Hamas attack, whose remains were recovered in an Israeli military operation in Gaza last week.\nSome expressed anger at the government for not reaching a deal with Hamas to end the fighting and return the remaining captives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horror, it\u2019s profound sadness and grief beyond words to describe the anger, the insult to the hostages, the insult to the fallen, the insult to the soldiers sent once again to Gaza,\u201d mourner Ruti Taro told The Associated Press news agency.\n\u201cNo one knows why, except for the power-hungry ruler,\u201d he said.\nIsraeli news site Ynet reported on Monday that Israeli army chief Eyal Zamir had warned of the implications of Netanyahu\u2019s intention to take over Gaza without making any post-war plans.\n\u201cYou are heading to a military government,\u201d Zamir reportedly told a meeting of the Israeli security cabinet late on Sunday. \u201cYour plan is leading us there. Understand the implications\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s war on Gaza has so far killed more than 63,000 Palestinians. About one million inhabitants of Gaza City, many of whom have already been displaced multiple times, are now being forced out under sustained Israeli attacks, with no safe zones to flee to in the enclave."

There is hardly any fighting going on, but heavy artillery and bulldozers are moving from one street to the other, destroying all of these residential clusters,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe majority of people in those areas do not have the luxury to pack up and leave because there is no safety anywhere.\u201d\nAnother Palestinian journalist was also killed on Sunday. A source at al-Shifa Hospital told Al Jazeera that Islam Abed was killed in an Israeli attack on Gaza City and that she worked for Al-Quds Al-Youm TV channel.\nThe Government Media Office said the \u201cnumber of martyred journalists has risen to 247\u2033 since the war began.

Then hundreds of thousands fled under Israel\u2019s forced evacuation threats before many returned, joined by thousands of other displaced from the south, during a January-to-March ceasefire, which Israel broke.\nFedaa Hamad, who was displaced from Beit Hanoon, said she has \u201cno plans to leave\u201d Gaza City this time despite Israel\u2019s latest warning.\n\u201cWe are tired from the first displacement. Where are we going to go? Is there a place in the south? We cannot find it,\u201d she said.\nAkram Mzini, a resident of Gaza City, said he would not leave \u201cbecause displacement is very difficult\u201d.\n\u201cWe were displaced to the south before, and displacement in the south is not simple and it is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cLife is difficult, so we will stay in our home, and whatever God wants will happen.\u201d\nElsewhere in Gaza on Sunday, an Israeli attack on the centre of Deir el-Balah killed at least four people, Al Jazeera Arabic reported.\nEarlier, medical sources said an Israeli bombardment killed at least one person and wounded several in the city, located in the central part of the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli forces have killed at least 78 Palestinians across Gaza since dawn, including 32 aid seekers, according to medical sources.\nSince the war began, Israel has killed at least 63,459 people and wounded 160,256.
