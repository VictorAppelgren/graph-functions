  "description": "Democratic lawmakers demand inquiry into whether citizens civil rights have been violated during immigration crackdown",
  "content": "June 2025 photo of federal agents detaining a person after an immigration hearing inside the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building in New York City.\n\nAmerican citizens have been increasingly caught up in the immigration crackdown: a four-year-old boy with cancer deported to Honduras, doctoral student filming a raid in Hollywood detained for 25 hours, an Illinois man held for 10 hours in detention.\n\nIncreasingly frustrated that the aggressive tactics are sweeping up American citizens, Democratic members of Congress have been pressing for a full accounting of the citizens detained.\n\nOn Friday morning 49 Congress members, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Representatives Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), sent letters to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari and two other immigration oversight offices asking them to open an investigation into encounters with American citizens and \u201cdetermine whether DHS is violating Americans\u2019 civil rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cICE policy makes clear that, by law \u2018ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen,\u201d the legislators wrote. \u201cHowever, in recent high-profile cases, ICE has erroneously arrested U.S. citizens, at times appearing to use violent physical force.\u201d\n\n\u201cICE has even deported U.S. citizens: in multiple cases, ICE has deported U.S. citizen children along with their undocumented parents, reportedly against the families\u2019 wishes. Particularly in Latino and Native American communities, Americans increasingly fear that their citizenship will not protect them from being swept up in DHS\u2019s immigration enforcement activities.\u201d\n\nFor months Democratic members of Congress have been demanding the Trump Administration answer pointed questions, to little avail.\n\nThe letters were sent to Cuffari, Troup Hemenway, acting officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and Joseph Guy, director for the Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman. The latter two of those offices have been hollowed out under the Trump Administration, which had attempted to abolish them completely.\n\n\u201cThe administration owes the American people answers, particularly as Republicans in Congress just approved record funding for immigration enforcement, which threatens to put even more citizens at risk,\u201d said Warren.\n\nThe Trump Administration has adamantly defended their actions.\n\n\u201cDHS enforcement operations are highly targeted and are not resulting in the arrest of U.S. citizens,\u201d said department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in response to The Times\u2019 inquiry about the number of Americans detained, arrested and deported under the administration.\n\n\u201cWe do our due diligence. We know who we are targeting ahead of time,\u201d she said. \u201cIf and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement are trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability. \u201c\n\nIn the case of Romero, the four-year old with stage-4 cancer, DHS pointed out at the time his mother had a final deportation order and said she chose to be deported with her children. Her lawyers contend the mother, who was arrested during a check-in with immigration officials in Louisiana, was never given a choice and was prohibited from talking to lawyers. They filed a lawsuit last month, along with another mother who also was deported with her 2-year-old citizen daughter.\n\nJennifer Iba\u00f1ez Whitlock, a policy expert at the National Immigration Law Center, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement used to publish data related to citizens booked-in and arrested, but that was mandated through appropriations and is no longer required.\n\nCurrently available data shows that in fiscal year 2025 there were no citizens deported and seven arrested. There was 3,700 parents of citizens removed and 6,341 arrested. The data is aggregated and does not show the location, reason for enforcement, outcome or length of detention \u2014 as lawmakers are asking for.\n\nWhitlock suspects the data is an undercount based on the number of cases she has seen in the media.\n\nThe immigration crackdown is expected to expand considerably. Congress approved a $170 billion budget for border and immigration enforcement earlier this summer, giving the agency the largest boost in generations. President Donald Trump wants 10,000 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents to be hired.\n\nImmigrant advocates fear with more capabilities, enforcement levels will explode and exacerbate encounters with citizens. Already they said, the White House has given agencies wider latitude than they had before.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the agency unleashed like never before,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, associate director of policy of National Immigrant Justice Center. \u201cICE is just picking up people, whoever is nearby and there is a lot of racial profiling happening.\u201d\n\nHe points to Julio Noriega, a 54-year-old U.S. citizen who was among those picked up in sweeps in early January in Chicago and placed in handcuffs.\n\nNoriega had been looking for work when agents picked him up and took him to an ICE processing center before looking inside his wallet, according to court documents. The Center and the ACLU of Illinois attorneys said he was detained for 10 hours and then released without his arrest ever being documented. Lawyers argued DHS violated a 2022 settlement requiring agents have probable cause to believe that a person is in the country illegally before arresting them and then reporting it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any transparency about warrantless arrests, we don\u2019t have transparency about how many U.S. citizens are being swept up and being arrested, \u201c he said. The data on citizen detained, he said, isn\u2019t always being captured.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many U.S. citizens are being detained beyond the media accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on these agencies to produce this information. These are serious issues.\u201d\n\nThe letter asks the oversight bodies to provide by Sept. 5 detailed information on stops, arrests, detentions and deportation of citizens including a breakdown by month, location, reason for enforcement action, outcome, and length of time in ICE custody.\n\n\u201cIt should send chills down everyone\u2019s spine if just one U.S. citizen is detained without due process during an ICE raid,\u201d said Padilla. \u201cThis is not a question of rights of immigrants versus rights of Americans, it\u2019s about ensuring that due process is afforded and protected for everyone, which the Fifth Amendment guarantees.\u201d\n\nDebra Fleischman, the former Chief of Staff at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said verifying somebody\u2019s citizenship can sometimes be complicated, but officials should be explaining how that works.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily automatically inappropriate to have arrested or held a U.S. citizen, but they certainly should not be deporting them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that they are encountering U.S citizens much more often than they have historically just because the scope of their interior enforcement activities are so much larger than they ever have been.\u201d\n\nEduardo Casas, an attorney for Job Garcia, the doctoral student who was detained after filming a raid at a Home Depot in Hollywood said he has been asking immigration officials for information about citizens detained and arrested during the Los Angeles sweeps this summer, but has so far been rebuffed.\n\n\u201cThey are not being transparent,\u201d said Eduardo Casas, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. \u201cWe know that citizens are being caught up in this broader enforcement paradigm that centers around mass deportation. The way they try to accomplish mass deportation is by pushing the boundaries of civil liberties in the same way that they\u2019ve done for people like Job.\u201d\n\nCasas said he interviewed other citizens present during raids and a pattern emerged. People filming angered agents, who then arrested them and took them to detention centers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll take people as far as detention centers, and then say that you may be charged, and then they let them go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also not very always a very formal process.\u201d",

      "text": "- Share via\nFirefighters on Friday continued battling the Canyon fire, which exploded to nearly 5,000 acres late Thursday, forcing thousands of residents in northern Los Angeles County and eastern Ventura County to evacuate.\nTaking advantage of cooler temperatures overnight, crews were able to make some inroads against the fast-moving blaze, halting any additional spread and reaching 25% containment by Friday morning, Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Dowd said. But he said the fight ahead remains challenging, given scorching weather and a parched landscape that, together, can foster extreme fire growth.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still expecting hot and dry conditions today,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cWe still have record-low fuel moisture in the area, so we\u2019re not letting our guard up.\u201d\nTwo small structures, likely sheds or outbuildings, have been confirmed destroyed in the blaze, Dowd said. Officials have not yet confirmed any homes or businesses damaged. Some video from the scene showed at least one building engulfed in flames, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear the extent of any additional damage.\nThe Canyon fire quickly became the largest of several fires sparked during days of intense heat in Southern California. To the north in Santa Barbara and San Luis Opisbo counties, the much larger Gifford fire has burned nearly 100,000 acres.\nThe Canyon fire broke out amid 100-degree temperatures and moderate onshore winds that hit up to 25 mph \u2014 a dangerous recipe when combined with the exceptionally dry vegetation.\nOn Thursday \u201cwe were seeing significant plume development, we were seeing very rapid fire growth\u2026 within certain areas of the fire,\u201d Dowd said.\nAnd those conditions were again expected Friday and into the weekend, though temperatures may drop a degree or two.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ripe for fires and fire spread,\u201d said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard. He said temperatures may peak Friday at 98 degrees around the Canyon fire, but the heat, winds, low humidity and parched landscape would continue to create elevated fire conditions through the weekend.\n\u201cAlthough a few degrees of cooling is expected through the weekend, a very warm air mass will remain in place. An onshore flow regime will keep temperatures from exceeding record levels, but temperatures are expected to remain above seasonal normals as high pressure aloft lingers over the southwestern United States,\u201d the weather service said in a Friday morning forecast.\nVentura County officials said the fire broke out around 2 p.m. Thursday near Holser Canyon Road, northeast of Piru \u2014 a small, unincorporated town not far from Castaic Junction.\nThe fire was initially reported to be about 30 acres, but within about two hours that estimate jumped to over 1,000 acres, according to Ventura County officials. By Friday morning, the fire had burned 4,856 acres and was spreading east toward Castaic and Interstate 5 in L.A. County.\nThe Canyon fire is threatening areas around Piru and Castiac. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nAbout 2,500 residents and 700 structures remained under evacuation orders, mostly in northern Los Angeles County near Castaic, while an additional 14,000 people and more than 4,700 structures were affected by evacuation warnings, according to Dowd.\nMore than 250 firefighters remained assigned to the incident, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\nL.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents the Santa Clarita Valley, urged residents to heed evacuation alerts.\n\u201cExtreme heat and low humidity in our north county have created dangerous conditions where flames can spread with alarming speed,\u201d Barger said in a statement. \u201cIf first responders tell you to leave, go \u2014 without hesitation. The Eaton fire showed us how quickly devastation can strike.\u201d\nAn evacuation center was opened in the East Gymnasium of the College of the Canyons, at 26455 Rockwell Canyon Road in Santa Clarita.\nLake Piru Recreation Area is closed until further notice, as is Piru Canyon Road, which connects the town of Piru to the lake.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about the fire\u2019s proximity to the Pitchess Detention Center, where about 5,000 inmates are housed in four jails. The center is east of the 5 Freeway and fell just outside an evacuation warning zone Thursday evening.\nSenior staff attorney Melissa Camacho said she was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the growing fire.\n\u201cJanuary\u2019s Hughes fire burned within a half-mile of the jails and not a single person incarcerated there was evacuated,\u201d Camacho told The Times. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking that, less than eight months later, the 5,000 people in the jails and their loved ones will spend another sleepless night watching a fire and praying that it doesn\u2019t reach them.\u201d\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department, which operates the facility, said it was actively monitoring fire conditions and was in constant communication with fire and county officials.\n\u201cSimilar to evacuation plans implemented at Pepperdine University in Malibu, the Fire Department has advised that a shelter-in-place strategy is the safest option for custody staff and inmates, given the building construction type and current fire behavior,\u201d agency spokesperson Nicole Nishida said in a statement. The area around the building has been cleared of brush and has wide defensible space, she said."

      "text": "- Share via\n- The Trump administration recently released a cache of classified files on the 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California, leaving attorneys for convicted gunman Sirhan Sirhan combing for new evidence in a case that has spawned many conspiracy theories.\nThe assassin concealed himself behind an ice machine in a crowded kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel with an eight-shot revolver. A small, wiry, pockmarked young man with curly hair and a hard-to-place accent, he loitered in the area for hours, asking kitchen workers if his target would be coming that way.\nIn the Embassy ballroom, Robert F. Kennedy, 42, New York senator and brother of a slain president, had just declared victory in the June 4, 1968, California Democratic primary. The ecstatic crowd chanted, \u201cWe want Bobby! We want Bobby!\u201d To study photos of the crowd is to see expressions of unembarrassed love, the kind few candidates inspire.\nKennedy\u2019s admirers revered him as a secular saint, a figure of hope in a brutal, tumultuous decade. But he was despised on the right and divisive on the left. In East Los Angeles, Mexican American crowds had greeted him rapturously; in Van Nuys, his campaign cars were pelted with stones.\nIn this series, Christopher Goffard revisits old crimes in Los Angeles and beyond, from the famous to the forgotten, the consequential to the obscure, diving into archives and the memories of those who were there.\nAssassinations had already left an indelible blight on the decade. John F. Kennedy was killed in 1963. In 1965, it was Malcolm X.\nIn April 1968, when Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, it fell to Robert F. Kennedy to break the news to a largely Black crowd in Indianapolis. He spoke of the \u201cstain of bloodshed that has spread across our land,\u201d and of the possibility of compassion. He said a white man had killed his brother. He quoted Aeschylus, his favorite poet.\nScores of cities exploded into rioting, in the wake of King\u2019s murder. Indianapolis did not, and Bobby Kennedy\u2019s admirers did not think it irrelevant that he had been there.\nShaking hands with kitchen workers, Kennedy waded through the Wilshire Boulevard hotel in the first minutes of June 5, headed to the Colonial Room to talk to reporters. The pantry was a shortcut.\nLater, his staffers would say the campaign did not want their candidate seen among uniformed LAPD, who were poisonous to voters they needed, particularly after the Watts riot of three years earlier. His protection was a thin scrim of hotel security and rent-a-cops hired for crowd control.\n***\nThe journalist Pete Hamill had encouraged Kennedy to run for president, writing, \u201cIf you won, the country might be saved.\u201d Owing to JFK\u2019s death, he perceived an air of \u201calmost permanent sadness\u201d in Kennedy\u2019s eyes.\nThat night, he accompanied Kennedy as he moved through the Ambassador pantry, which he described it as \u201ca long grubby area\u2026the sort of place where Puerto Ricans, blacks and Mexican-Americans usually work to fill white stomachs.\u201d\nKitchen workers pressed forward to touch him. Then the gunman emerged \u2014 a messenger, Hamill wrote, \u201cfrom the secret filthy heart of America.\u201d Hamill saw him with his right foot forward and his right arm extended, firing.\nTwo .22-caliber bullets hit Kennedy in the back and a third entered behind his right ear, fragmenting in his brain. An Associated Press reporter said the shots sounded \u201calmost like a brief burst of machine-gun fire.\u201d\nRosey Grier, a hulking defensive tackle for the Los Angeles Rams who was in the crowd, rushed in to pin the gunman against a serving table. \u201cGet the gun, get the gun!\u201d people screamed, but the gunman managed to empty his eight-shooter. Five bystanders were hit but not fatally.\nSome were yelling for instant vigilante justice, while others cried, \u201cDon\u2019t kill him! No Jack Ruby!\u201d Already haunting the scene was the dread of a reprise of Dallas, where Ruby gunned down Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK\u2019s assassin.\nNow the younger Kennedy, fatally wounded, lay beside the ice machine on the dirty floor. Somebody put rosary beads in his hands, and his wife, Ethel, mother of his 11 children, touched ice cubes to his cheek.\n***\nThe gunman refused to identify himself at first, and police could not place his accent. He was arraigned as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d in an early-morning courtroom session convened without advance word to the press or public, with the goal of avoiding \u201canother Dallas.\u201d\nHis name was Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, 24, an identity confirmed because he left his fingerprints with a job application at Hollywood Park racetrack. A Jordanian who immigrated to the States at 12, he lived with his mother in a white-frame house in Pasadena.\nHis life had been a chronicle of failures and accumulating resentments. He\u2019d failed out of Pasadena City College. He\u2019d found a job at a health food store, but couldn\u2019t keep it. He\u2019d tried to be a jockey, but horses kept throwing him. He\u2019d been reduced to the low-status task of walking the horses, but he couldn\u2019t keep that job either.\nSirhan frequently expressed \u201canti-Jewish feelings,\u201d acquaintances told The Times, and his supreme hatred was the existence of the state of Israel. Kennedy, who had reported in British Palestine for the Boston Post in his early 20s, had become a stalwart supporter of the Jewish state and in a recent interview had proposed selling it 50 Phantom fighter jets.\nIn one of his notebooks, Sirhan had written, \u201cKennedy must be assassinated before June 5, 1968.\u201d That was the one-year anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War in which Israel had defeated a coalition of Arab armies. Sirhan had missed his timeline, as it happened, by just a few minutes.\n\u201cRFK must be disposed of like his brother was,\u201d Sirhan wrote in a journal found by investigators, a theme he stressed in many scribbled notes. \u201cRobert Fitzgerald Kennedy must soon die die die die die die die die die die.\u2026 My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more the more (sic) of an unshakable obsession\u2026. Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated assassinated assassinated assassinated.\u201d\nAt his trial, Sirhan\u2019s legal team did not dispute that he had killed Kennedy and said he acted alone. Their goal was to spare him the death penalty by convincing jurors it was second-degree murder. It was the act of an \u201cimmature, emotionally disturbed and mentally ill youth\u201d who had killed in a trancelike state, said defense attorney Emil Berman.\nHe had been traumatized by the sight of political violence as a child, the attorney said, and news of the Arab-Israeli conflict unleashed blinding rage. \u201cIn his fantasies, he was often a hero and savior of his people,\u201d Berman said. With the trial in headlines worldwide, the Palestine Liberation Organization distributed posters of Sirhan praising him as \u201ca commando, not an assassin.\u201d\nSirhan\u2019s angry outbursts became a regular feature of the trial. He was enraged at the release of his notebooks, of his poor school grades, of his 89 score on an IQ test. At one point, he announced he wanted the gas chamber. \u201cI killed Robert F. Kennedy willfully, premeditatedly, and with 20 years of malice aforethought,\u201d he told the court, later explaining it was a reference to the 1948 birth of Israel.\nTaking the stand, Sirhan testified that he could change the color of a candle flame with the power of his mind. He said he not remember committing the shooting. He said he\u2019d been drunk. He delivered a screed on the history of the Middle East, telling his attorney, \u201cZionism is more inimical to me than communism is to you.\u201d\nDefense psychiatrists said Sirhan suffered paranoia and social maladjustment, that he viewed Kennedy as a surrogate for the father who had abandoned him, and that mirrors at the Ambassador Hotel might have initiated his homicidal trance.\nProsecutor Lynn Compton ridiculed the claims.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t buy it, like I don\u2019t buy it,\u201d he told jurors, \u201cthen there\u2019s nothing left but plain old cold-blooded first-degree murder.\u201d\nJurors convicted him and gave him death, a sentence commuted to life in prison in 1972 when the state Supreme Court ruled capital punishment unconstitutional. Sirhan\u2019s release was among the demands a year later, when the Black September terrorist group kidnapped the U.S. ambassador and two other Western envoys in Sudan. (The U.S. refused; the three were executed.)\nIn a 1989 interview with journalist David Frost, Sirhan again disavowed any conspiracy in Kennedy\u2019s death, suggesting it was at odds with his mistrustful nature; he knew how a collaborator could easily become a witness against him. He claimed to feel remorse, while at the same time comparing himself to a Jew who had been given the opportunity to kill Adolf Hitler.\nBy his 2016 parole hearing, Sirhan\u2019s rhetoric had changed. He was now insisting he had not even done the crime, buoyed by conspiracy theorists positing that he had somehow been hypnotically programmed to fire his gun in order to divert attention from the real shooter.\n\u201cLegally speaking, I\u2019m not guilty of anything,\u201d he said.\nIt was not until 2021, however, that he convinced a parole panel that he should go free, a decision supported by the victim\u2019s third son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is now the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services.\nRFK Jr. described Sirhan\u2019s guilt as \u201ca fiction.\u201d He believed a security guard had done it, perhaps as part of a CIA scheme. When he met the 77-year-old Sirhan in prison, he wrote, he found him \u201cgentle, humble, kindhearted, frail and harmless.\u201d\nMost of the Kennedy family rejected the plea for parole, as did Gov. Gavin Newsom, noting that Sirhan refused to take responsibility for his crime. His lack of insight made him a continued threat, the governor wrote, and described him as \u201can ideological lightning rod\u201d who might inspire further political violence.\n\u201cSirhan, one man with a gun, acting alone, inflicted grievous harm to our country,\u201d Newsom wrote.\nThe Trump administration recently released a cache of classified files on the assassination, and Sirhan\u2019s current attorney, Angela Berry, said a team of researchers is combing them for new evidence. \u201cSo far there hasn\u2019t been anything of use,\u201d she said.\nThe investigative journalist Dan Moldea, who studied the case for years, went into it believing there was a good case for a second gunman but emerged with a book, \u201cThe Killing of Robert F. Kennedy,\u201d that meticulously debunked the theories. (One popular theory involved gouges in the pantry walls misidentified as holes from unaccounted-for bullets.) After multiple prison interviews, Moldea came to believe Sirhan was intent on using him.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why not admit you did it, instead of this bulls\u2014 that you were drunk and don\u2019t remember anything?\u2019 \u201d Moldea told The Times in a recent interview. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Listen, why should I admit guilt when I got you out there coming up with exculpatory evidence saying I didn\u2019t do it?\u2019 \u201d\nAuthor Mel Ayton, who has written extensively about Sirhan, said the killer was a chronic failure who believed the murder would make him a hero.\n\u201cWhat [Sirhan] thought would be a redeeming feature of his life is his politics, which has been ignored by conspiracy writers,\u201d Ayton told The Times.\nHe said crackpot theories have found oxygen in historical amnesia: \u201cIf there\u2019s no motive, they can promote their idea that he was just an innocent patsy.\u201d\nIn a foreword to Ayton\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Making of an Assassin: Why Sirhan Sirhan Murdered Robert Kennedy,\u201d former FBI profiler John Douglas (with Mark Olshaker), describes Sirhan as both \u201ca mentally unstable and angry nobody and a driven, mission-oriented ideologue.\u201d\nWell before he did it, Sirhan expressed his plans, not just in writing but in conversation. At the 1969 trial, a Black trash collector named Alvin Clark testified about arguing with Sirhan a few weeks before the California primary.\nTo Clark, Kennedy was the man who had paid to bring the murdered Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s body home to his family.\nSirhan said, \u201cI\u2019m planning on shooting him.\u201d\nClark replied, \u201cIf you do, you\u2019ll be killing one of the best men in the country.\u201d"

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Once again, the media is shamefully peddling a false narrative in an attempt to demonize our ICE enforcement agents, who are already facing a 300% surge in assaults again them. The media and Democrat politicians are force-feeding the public false information that US citizen children are being deported.\nThis is false and irresponsible. In both of these cases the mothers had a final order of deportation. Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates. Both mothers choose to deport with their children.\nJenny Carolina Lopez-Villela illegally entered this country three times in September 2019, March of 2021, and August 2021. She and her older daughter were deemed inadmissible to the United States the first time she entered the country and both her and her daughter were given final orders of removal in March 2020. When she was taken into ICE custody in April 2025, she chose to bring her younger daughter, who is an American Citizen, with her to Honduras and presented a valid United States passport.\nReachel Alexas Morales-Valle entered this country illegally and was released into the interior in 2013. She was given a final order of deportation in 2015. In February of 2025, she was arrested by Kenner Police Department in Louisiana for speeding, driving without insurance, and driving without a license. When she was taken into ICE custody in April 2025, she chose to bring both children, who are American citizens, with her to Honduras and presented a valid United States passport for each child.\nDHS takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected. Parents, who are here illegally, can take control of their departure. Through the CBP Home App\u2014 the Trump Administration is giving parents illegally in the country a chance to take full control of their departure and self-deport, with the potential ability to return the legal, right way and come back to live the American dream. It is free and available for all mobile devices."

      "text": "- Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office investigates abuses\n- Current, former staffers say move undermines oversight\nThe Department of Homeland Security is dismantling the office that investigates civil rights violations in immigrant enforcement and other departmental work as President Donald Trump aims to downsize federal agencies.\nEmployees in the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties received news of the closure in a meeting Friday afternoon, according to a Senate aide and four people in the meeting or briefed on it in real time. Bloomberg Government first reported on the development. DHS is also slashing the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which helps members of the public resolve problems with immigration benefits, according to the department.\n\u201cThese offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS\u2019s mission,\u201d agency spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a text message confirming reductions in force in both offices. \u201cRather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.\u201d\nDHS is also cutting staff in the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which looks specifically at detention conditions, because it \u201chas misused taxpayer funds by facilitating complaints that encourage illegal immigration,\u201d McLaughlin said.\nThe personnel in the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will be placed on administrative leave and then terminated, the Senate aide said.\nCivil rights advocates and lawmakers had raised alarm in recent days that deep cuts to DHS oversight were imminent and would undermine oversight as the Trump administration ramps up immigrant detention and deportations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an office that serves a fire alarm function,\u201d said University of Michigan law professor Margo Schlanger, who led CRCL for two years under then-President Barack Obama.\nConservative critics have derided the office as a liberal activist group bent on weakening immigration enforcement. Project 2025, backed by the Heritage Foundation, recommended slashing the entire unit in favor of a single officer who reports to DHS\u2019s general counsel.\n\u201cA decision to eliminate the CRCL office or make significant reductions in CRCL staff will jeopardize DHS\u2019s ability to comply with statutory requirements and to protect the civil rights and civil liberties of the American people,\u201d Democratic Sens.\n\u2018Literally Dangerous\u2019\nCongress established the civil rights officer position while creating DHS in 2002, tasking the appointee with ensuring that efforts to combat domestic threats didn\u2019t infringe on basic rights and liberties.\nThe role has grown into an office of around 150 people, as of CRCL\u2019s latest congressional report. It\u2019s divided into sections that review DHS employees\u2019 discrimination complaints, advise the department and its agencies on policies that implicate civil rights, and investigate alleged violations.\nThe team\u2019s budget and staff increased dramatically in just the past few years, from $25 million and 97 employees in fiscal 2019 up to nearly $46 million and 144 employees in fiscal 2023. Congress has since reduced annual funding to around $43 million.\nSome of the growth stems from an expanding set of responsibilities lawmakers have given to CRCL, including reviewing immigration enforcement agreements with local law enforcement agencies. Statutory responsibilities will be moved to other parts of DHS, people briefed on Friday\u2019s meeting said.\nThe office lacks veto power over agency actions that raise concerns, but it can influence how policies are crafted and carried out. During Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, for example, CRCL advised DHS agencies on intelligence gathering and the expanded use of artificial intelligence to identify potential bias problems.\nCompliance officials in the office regularly visit immigrant detention and holding facilities to review conditions. CRCL was instrumental in shedding light on family separation during Trump\u2019s first term, uncovering that officials weren\u2019t properly tracking children and parents to be able to reunite them, said Schlanger, the Obama-era official.\nThat type of oversight is more important now than ever, advocates say, as DHS\u2019s Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement aim to ramp up immigrant detention and mount the biggest deportation campaign in history.\n\u201cAs the number of detention facilities owned and operated by the private prison industry grows, and those companies reap millions of dollars in profits from President Trump\u2019s mass deportation policies, CRCL must be allowed to investigate conditions of detention and its continued full funding is crucial to carrying out those responsibilities,\u201d Katherine Culliton-Gonz\u00e1lez, who led CRCL during part of Biden\u2019s term, said. She\u2019s now chief policy counsel at the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\nThe results of scaled-back oversight are dire, said former CRCL career official Scott Shuchart, who later served as a Biden ICE appointee.\n\u201cIt is literally dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople die in ICE custody. People die in CBP custody. And sometimes it happens for unpreventable reasons and sometimes it happens for preventable reasons.\u201d\n\u2018Considerable Waste\u2019\nThe Heritage-backed Project 2025 provided a playbook last year for dismantling the DHS civil rights office. The project noted federal mandates require a civil rights and civil liberties officer at DHS, but not an entire unit.\nThe current size and scope of the office duplicates inspector general work and \u201cresults in considerable waste of limited component resources,\u201d the document said. The authors called for downsizing to a single officer with a focus on equal employment opportunity compliance and civil rights incidents within DHS headquarters \u2014 allowing subagencies to handle their own investigations.\nTrump disavowed Project 2025 on the campaign trail last year but has since embraced many recommendations.\nTrump\u2019s Early Actions Mirror Project 2025 Plan He Once Dismissed\nThe cuts at CRCL and other offices come as Homeland Security officials work to carry out a White House directive to plan broad reductions in force and reorganizations. The offices were also among the few parts of DHS eligible for earlier deferred resignation offers.\nTrump \u2018Buyout\u2019 Risks Immigration Enforcement Watchdog Cuts\nPeters and Durbin, the top Democrats on the Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, argued in their letter this week that DHS must \u201cfully support\u201d the agency\u2019s CRCL officer with staff and resources to comply with the congressional mandate for the position.\nTo contact the reporter on this story:\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story:"

      "text": "\u2018A good day\u2019: Detained U.S. citizen said agents bragged after arresting dozens at Home Depot\n- Share via\nA 37-year-old U.S. citizen who was tackled to the ground and arrested after filming federal agents at Home Depot on Thursday said he was held for more than an hour near Dodger Stadium, where agents boasted about how many immigrants they arrested.\n\u201cHow many bodies did you guys grab today?\u201d he said one agent asked.\n\u201cOh, we grabbed 31,\u201c the other replied.\n\u201cThat was a good day today,\u201d the first agent responded.\nThe two high-fived, as he sat on the asphalt under the sun, Job Garcia said.\nGarcia was released on Friday from a downtown federal detention center. No apparent criminal charges have yet to be filed. He is one of several U.S citizens arrested during enforcement operations in recent days. Department of Homeland Security officials say some have illegally interfered with agents\u2019 jobs.\nIn response to questions about why Garcia was arrested and if he\u2019d been charged, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in L.A. recommended a reporter contact the Department of Homeland Security.\nDHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment.\nGarcia said he was shaken by what he heard while he was detained.\n\u201cThey call them \u2018bodies,\u2019 they reduce them to bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cMy blood was boiling.\u201d\nGarcia, a photographer and doctoral student Claremont Graduate University, had been picking up a delivery at Home Depot when someone approached the customer desk and said something was unfolding outside.\n\u201cLa migra, La migra,\u201d he heard as he walked out. He quickly grabbed his phone and followed agents around the parking lot, telling them they were \u201cf\u2014 useless\u201d until he came to a group of them forming a half-circle around a box truck.\nA Border Patrol agent radioed someone and then slammed his baton against the passenger window, his video shows. Glass shattered. He unlocked the door as people shouted.\nIn the video, a stunned man can be seen texting behind the wheel. He had apparently refused to open his door.\nIt\u2019s unclear from the footage what happened next, but Garcia said an agent lunged toward him and pushed him.\n\u201cMy first reaction was to like push his hand off,\u201d he recalled. Then, he said, the agent grabbed his left arm, twisted it behind his back and threw his phone.\nThe agent brought him to the ground and three other agents jumped in, Garcia said\n\u201cGet the f\u2014 down sir\u201d and \u201cgive me your f\u2014 hand. You want it, you got it, sir, you f\u2014 got it. You want to go to jail, fine. You got it,\u201d an agent can be heard saying in the video.\n\u201cYou wanted it, you got it,\u201d the man yelled.\nAn agent handcuffed him so hard \u201cthat there was no circulation running to my fingers,\u201d Garcia said.\nPinned down, Garcia had difficulty breathing.\n\u201cThat moment, I thought I could probably die here,\u201d he said.\nThe agent put Garcia\u2019s phone back in his pocket. The recording kept running.\nAs Garcia was put into a vehicle, his video captured an agent twice saying: \u201cI\u2019ve got one back here.\u201d\n\u201cYou got one what?\u201d Garcia shot back. \u201cYou got one what?\u201d\nHe said an agent told him in broken Spanish to \u201cwait here,\u2019 though it could not be heard on the video.\n\u201cI f\u2014 speak English, you f\u2014 dumbass,\u201d he clearly shouts back.\nNo agent asked if he was an American citizen, he said. Nobody asked for identification.\n\u201cThey assumed that I was undocumented,\u201d he said later in an interview.\nThe video ends after about four minutes, while he is waiting in the van.\nImmigration agents arrest dozens around Home Depot in Hollywood, shattering the lives of the vendors and their families who created a makeshift community there.\nGarcia asked an agent to get his wallet from his car, so he could prove he was a U.S. citizen. Another agent retrieved his ID, but he remained handcuffed.\nThey were so tight, his hands began to swell.\nThe agents switched him to handcuffs that looked like shoelaces. They took off around a corner, stopped to shuffle him into another van and sped off down the 101 Freeway.\n\u201cI smeared my blood in their seat,\u201d he said. And he thought, \u201cThey\u2019re going to remember me.\u201d\nWith him in the van was a Mexican man, face downcast, who said his wife was six months pregnant.\n\u201cMy wife told me not to go to work today,\u201d the man said. \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d he said she told him.\n\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI wish he was the one who got away when they were trying to grab me.\u201d\nOn what he described as a ramp going into Dodger stadium near Lot K, Garcia was taken out of the car and told to sit on the asphalt as agents shuffled detainees into different vans and processed them for about an hour. A woman ran his background for criminal offenses.\nIt felt surreal and enraging.\n\u201cThey were trying to build some sort of case,\u201d Garcia said. He told The Times he was arrested at 17 for driving without a license.\nAfter they transported him, agents later fingerprinted him and tried to interrogate him.\nThe agent said they wanted to \u201ctake your side of the story.\u201d\nGarcia declined.\nHe said he overheard an agent tell someone, \u201cTrump is really working us.\u201d\nWhile held at a downtown detention facility, he met Adrian Martinez.\nMartinez, a 20-year-old Walmart worker and also a U.S. citizen, had been arrested on Tuesday while he tried to stop the arrest of a man who cleaned a shopping center in Pico Rivera. The two spoke for about 10 minutes, as Martinez waited to go to court.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Walmart kid, right?\u201d he asked him.\nGarcia told him what had unfolded outside the Home Depot.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened to me,\u201d he said Martinez told him. \u201cThey were bullying this older guy. I didn\u2019t like that so I went and confronted them and they put their hands on me and I pushed their hands off.\u201d\nU.S. Atty. Bill Essayli posted a photo of Martinez on X and said he \u201cwas arrested for an allegation of punching a border patrol agent in the face after he attempted to impede their immigration enforcement operation.\u201d Martinez was charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to impede a federal officer.\nThe complaint makes no reference to a punch, but alleges that Martinez blocked agents\u2019 vehicles with his car and then later a trash can.\n\u201cA complaint generally contains one charge and does not include the full scope of a defendant\u2019s conduct, or the evidence that will be presented at trial,\u201d said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in L.A. \u201cConsidering this is an active case, we will not be providing further comments outside of court proceedings.\u201d\nMartinez was released Friday on a $5,000 bond.\n\u201cU.S. Attorney Essayli and U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino outrageously alleged that Adrian assaulted a federal agent,\u201d Martinez\u2019s attorneys said in a statement. \u201cHowever he has not been charged with an assault charge because he didn\u2019t assault anyone, and the evidence of that is clear.\u201d\nGarcia said his cellmate was worried about these protests. He asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think the protesters who are out there destroying property, rioters, is a bad look?\u201d\n\u201cRioting is the language of the unheard,\u201d he said, riffing on a quote from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr."

      "text": "Masked robber put L.A. family in boarded-up closet. DNA revealed he was no stranger\n- Share via\n- A Woodland Hills family was held captive by a suspect who forced them into a closet and boarded up the doors.\n- Los Angeles County prosecutors allege the masked man was no stranger to the family.\nLara Starr had just walked in through the door when she saw a masked man holding a gun inside her Woodland Hills home.\nStarr assumed this was part of a game called Water Assassins that her son, a high school senior, played with his classmates.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t totally unusual for kids to be creeping around our house with big squirt guns,\u201d she said.\nStarr testified at a preliminary hearing Wednesday in a Van Nuys courtroom, where she described a bizarre and disturbing series of events that began the afternoon of March 3.\nShe, her son and husband were held captive by a man who forced them into a closet and boarded up the doors with plywood. Starr and her spouse testified that the man said he intended to empty their retirement accounts. If they resisted, he promised to burn down the house with them trapped inside.\nAuthorities say illegal card games hosted at mansions in Encino, Sherman Oaks and the Hollywood Hills bring together Israeli organized crime figures, Latino gang members and gamblers who racked up debts as high as $1.5 million.\nThe man eventually charged with kidnapping, robbing and threatening her family turned out to be no stranger to Starr. But when she first saw the person standing in her hallway dressed in a long sleeve white shirt, dark pants, balaclava and blue latex gloves, she had no idea who he was.\nOne of her son\u2019s friends had taken the squirt gun game too far, she thought. Thinking she\u2019d call his bluff, she turned to walk away.\nSomething hard crashed into the back of her head. The intruder shoved her against a wall and threw her to the ground.\n\u201cThere was blood everywhere,\u201d she said.\nThe intruder held out some zip ties. \u201cBehave,\u201d he said.\nStarr slipped the ties around her wrists, and the intruder cinched them tight.\nHe dragged Starr to her feet and zip tied her to a chair inside a walk-in closet attached to the master bedroom. She asked what he wanted. Money, he said.\nStarr told him where to find the keys to their safe, which held about $3,000 in cash belonging to her in-laws, who\u2019d been displaced by the Palisades fire.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, \u201ctake the cash and go.\u201d\nAfter dragging Starr\u2019s son into the closet and zip tying him to another chair, the intruder offered to put a compress on her head, which was leaking blood.\nHe spoke in \u201ca sort of Eastern European accent,\u201d Starr testified, but lapsed at times into \u201cother unidentified accents.\u201d As they waited for her husband to return, the masked man rambled about himself.\nHe\u2019d been smuggled through the \u201cport of Atlanta\u201d inside a shipping container, he said. Describing himself as a kind of indentured servant, he said he\u2019d been \u201cforced to work in a criminal enterprise, and if he didn\u2019t, he would be killed,\u201d Starr testified.\n\u201cHe made a point of saying he knew a lot about us,\u201d Starr recalled. The intruder said he\u2019d watched the family\u2019s comings and goings by hacking into a neighbor\u2019s surveillance system that provided a view of their driveway. He also, oddly, knew the names of the people who lived in the house before Starr did.\nTwo hours crept by. Then Starr heard the sound of her husband punching in the code to their door and the click-clack of his cycling shoes on the floor.\nManuel Quintero, alleged to be a member of the Mexican Mafia prison syndicate, is charged with killing the owner of El Farallon, a popular Lynwood nightclub.\n\u201cYou can hear him walking through the house, trying to figure out what was going on,\u201d she testified.\nThe intruder pointed a gun at the bedroom door, \u201cwaiting for him to turn the corner,\u201d Starr said.\nCraig Didden testified he was met with a gun pointed at his face.\n\u201cRelax,\u201d the masked person holding the gun said.\nThat voice sounds familiar, Didden recalled thinking.\nThe intruder ordered Didden to send emails to his and his wife\u2019s employers and his son\u2019s school, explaining they\u2019d be gone for the next few days. Didden testified that he tried his best to type with his wrists zip tied together while the man read over his shoulder.\nIt would take five days to transfer all of the money from their retirement accounts, the intruder told the family.\n\u201cHe said he had a number of tools to get us to cooperate,\u201d Starr testified, \u201cbut worst case-scenario, he\u2019d leave us zip tied in the closet and burn the house down.\u201d\nWhen the suspect brought them snacks \u2014 bananas, beef jerky and sparkling water \u2014 Starr felt the ordeal had veered into the absurd. \u201cIt just seemed so incongruous to zip tie someone in their closet,\u201d she said, \u201cand then bring them a bottle of Perrier.\u201d\nLeft in the darkened closet, Starr testified she heard the whir of an electric drill as the intruder boarded up the doors with sheets of plywood. After the house fell silent, they rifled through pockets of clothes inside the closet, finding a manicure kit and a ninja star inside a box of childhood mementos. Using these tools and a nail file that Starr had slipped in her pocket when she used the restroom, they cut the zip ties and came up with a plan.\nOnce the light peeked through a gap in the closet doors, Didden called out for water. Hearing nothing, he kicked the plywood off the doors and crawled out. The three climbed out of a bathroom window, scaled a fence in the backyard and banged on the window of a neighbor who called 911.\nStarr and Didden walked through their home with officers from the Los Angeles Police Department. Starr testified her and her mother\u2019s engagement rings were missing. So was a string of pearls she\u2019d worn at her wedding and her great-grandfather\u2019s pocket watch.\nThe doorjambs had been screwed shut and food was scattered around the kitchen. In trash cans in the kitchen and bathroom, detectives found ripped blue latex gloves, Deputy Dist. Atty. Catherine Chon said in court.\nPolice tested the gloves for DNA. After receiving the results, they arrested Rodolfo Christopher Gil \u2014 the son of Starr and Didden\u2019s next-door neighbor.\nStarr testified that she and Gil\u2019s family, while \u201cnot terribly close,\u201d were \u201cpleasant neighbors.\u201d She\u2019d known Gil for the 15 years she\u2019d lived next to his family.\n\u201cWe share a driveway,\u201d she said.\nIn a motion for bail, Gil\u2019s attorney said the 35-year-old father of one has no \u201cprior violent criminal history.\u201d According to a tax return attached to the motion, Gil reported being self-employed and earned about $40,000 in 2024, including more than $13,000 in unemployment benefits.\nHis lawyer, Paul Geller, asked Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Diego Edber to dismiss the charges against Gil, saying they weren\u2019t supported by evidence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible this was a replica gun,\u201d he told the judge.\nIn a war for control of L.A.\u2019s Armenian underworld, federal authorities say rival crews of gangsters engaged in a series of dramatic shootings and kidnappings across the San Fernando Valley.\nEdber ruled he\u2019d heard enough testimony for Gil to stand trial on 16 counts of kidnapping, assault, false imprisonment, burglary, robbery and criminal threats.\nA sheriff\u2019s deputy led Gil back to a jail cell in handcuffs as he nodded to his family in the courtroom audience.\nIt\u2019s unclear if they still live next door to Starr and Didden."
