  "description": "Agentic AI streamlines public services through automation",
  "content": "Across the UK's public sector, digital transformation is no longer a future goal, it's a daily necessity. From healthcare to local councils, teams are under growing pressure to deliver more, more efficiently. With Labour now in government, the focus must shift from AI hype to tangible, measurable outcomes that improve both public services and the lives of citizens.\n\nAI adoption in the UK is already accelerating across the public sector. According to the National Audit Office, 70% of respondents in government bodies last year were piloting and planning AI use cases - and this number is only increasing.\n\nAmong recent innovations, agentic AI stands out for its potential to reshape public service delivery. Agentic AI doesn\u2019t just assist users it acts on their behalf, it is like an invisible colleague, giving public sector workers time back to concentrate on higher-value tasks. For example, it can automatically draft responses to citizen inquiries, process routine paperwork, or generate policy briefs by summarizing large volumes of legislative and research data.\n\nTo see widespread adoption and demonstrate its immense potential to revolutionize UK public services, agentic AI cannot be locked behind expensive paywalls or complex integrations. Instead, it should be embedded into the platforms already used by millions quietly working in the background to remove friction and unlock capacity.\n\nBuilt with four core agentic skills \u2013 reasoning, memory, task action, and orchestration \u2013 agentic AI uses these skills to complete tasks and act autonomously under human oversight to support public servants in their day-to-day work. Take the example of administrative overhead in healthcare, education, or local government - often the invisible weight negatively impacting productivity and morale. In roles like community health visits or social work, professionals frequently spend as much time on documentation as they do with people. With the help of agentic AI instead of spending time after each consultation writing up a report, agentic AI can do so in their place without asking. This means trained professionals can get on and do what they do best and trained for: supporting people.\n\nOr imagine a local council meeting where decisions are made about community projects. With the help of agentic AI, the meeting's key points can be summarized instantly, action items can be identified, and follow-up communications can be drafted \u2013 automatically without manual intervention. Agentic AI can also analyze and develop content based on uploaded documents which can be a huge benefit for officials across the civil service and local government. Whether it's creating campaign briefs or drafting policy documents, agentic AI can help public servants get over the hurdle of producing a first draft, giving them more time to focus on strategic or higher-value initiatives during their day. In resource-constrained teams - common in the public sector - it\u2019s like gaining an extra pair of hands.\n\nWith the right permissions, agentic AI can do much more than summarize meetings. It can even understand schedules and book meetings on team's behalf, under the user's discretion.\n\nTechnology is only part of the equation. For agentic AI to serve its purpose, adoption must be transparent, inclusive, and focused on solving real-world problems. Public trust is paramount, and any AI deployed in public services must meet high standards for privacy, bias mitigation, and accountability. That\u2019s why implementation matters as much as innovation.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to implement agentic AI is by integrating it into tools that people already use every day. Whether it be for communication, collaboration, education, service delivery, or operations. These are the platforms and systems that employees, students, and citizens are already comfortable with. Embedding AI into these familiar environments builds user confidence, simplifies training and education, and accelerates adoption by meeting people where they are, rather than introducing entirely new workflows.\n\nCrucially, being transparent isn\u2019t just a matter of ethics, it\u2019s a prerequisite for public trust. Building confidence in AI starts with inclusive design, rigorous governance, and a commitment to using these tools to solve real-world challenges. When citizens see that AI is being applied responsibly and with their interests in mind, it becomes more than a technological advance; it becomes a public asset.\n\nAgentic AI has the potential to reshape public services by automating routine tasks, supporting better decisions, and allowing frontline workers to focus on people rather than paperwork. It supports the broader goal of building a public sector that is more efficient, responsive, and centered around citizens\u2019 needs.\n\nTo realize this vision, public-private collaboration will be essential. The public sector must continue to set the direction - anchored in fairness, transparency, and service to citizens - while tech providers must ensure that innovation is accessible, responsibly deployed, and truly supportive of the people on the frontlines.\n\nAgentic AI is not a distant vision but rather a present opportunity. If embraced wisely, it can be the catalyst that powers Labour's vision for a reimagined, modernized public sector.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Brainpower unleashed: agentic AI and beyond bots\nAgentic AI orchestrates intelligent automation, empowering future-proof digital transformation\nWhat truly separates us from machines? Free will, creativity and intelligence? But think about it. Our brains aren't singular, monolithic processors. The magic isn't in one \u201cthinking part,\u201d but rather in countless specialized agents\u2014neurons\u2014that synchronize perfectly.\nSome neurons catalog facts, others process logic or govern emotion, still more retrieve memories, orchestrate movement, or interpret visual signals. Individually, they perform simple tasks, yet collectively, they produce the complexity we call human intelligence.\nNow, imagine replicating this orchestration digitally. Traditional AI was always narrow: specialized, isolated bots designed to automate mundane tasks. But the new frontier is Agentic AI\u2014systems built from specialized, autonomous agents that interact, reason and cooperate, mirroring the interplay within our brains.\nLarge language models (LLMs) form the linguistic neurons, extracting meaning and context. Specialized task agents execute distinct functions like retrieving data, analyzing trends and even predicting outcomes. Emotion-like agents gauge user sentiment, while decision-making agents synthesize inputs and execute actions.\nThe result is digital intelligence and agency. But do we need machines to mimic human intelligence and autonomy?\nChief Technology Officer, Edge Platforms, EdgeVerve.\nEvery domain has a choke point\u2014Agentic AI unblocks them all\nAsk the hospital chief who\u2019s trying to fill a growing roster of vacant roles. The World Health Organization predicts a global shortfall of 10 million healthcare workers by 2030. Doctors and nurses pull 16-hour shifts like it\u2019s the norm. Claims processors grind through endless policy reviews, while lab technicians wade through a forest of paperwork before they can even test a single sample.\nIn a well-orchestrated Agentic AI world, these professionals get some relief. Claim-processing bots can read policies, assess coverage and even detect anomalies in minutes\u2014tasks that would normally take hours of mind-numbing, error-prone work. Lab automation agents could receive patient data directly from electronic health records, run initial tests and auto-generate reports, freeing up technicians for the more delicate tasks that truly need human skill.\nThe same dynamic plays out across industries. Take banking, where anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) processes remain the biggest administrative headaches. Corporate KYC demands endless verification steps, complex cross-checks, and reams of paperwork. An agentic system can orchestrate real-time data retrieval, conduct nuanced risk analysis and streamline compliance so that staff can focus on actual client relationships rather than wrestling with forms.\nInsurance claims, telecom contract reviews, logistics scheduling\u2014the list is endless. Each domain has repetitive tasks that bog down talented people.\nAI is the flashlight in a dark basement\nYes, agentic AI is the flashlight in a dark basement: shining a bright light on hidden inefficiencies, letting specialized agents tackle the grunt work in parallel, and giving teams the bandwidth to focus on strategy, innovation and building deeper connections with customers.\nBut the true power agentic AI lies in its ability to solve not just for efficiency or one department but to scale seamlessly across multiple functions\u2014even multiple geographies. This is an improvement of 100x scale.\n1. Scalability: Agentic AI is modular at its core, allowing you to start small\u2014like a single FAQ chatbot\u2014then seamlessly expand. Need real-time order tracking or predictive analytics later? Add an agent without disrupting the rest. Each agent handles a specific slice of work, cutting development overhead and letting you deploy new capabilities without ripping apart your existing setup.\n2. Anti-fragility: In a multi-agent system, one glitch won\u2019t topple everything. If a diagnostic agent in healthcare goes offline, other agents\u2014like patient records or scheduling\u2014keep working. Failures stay contained within their respective agents, ensuring continuous service. That means your entire platform won\u2019t crash because one piece needs a fix or an upgrade.\n3. Adaptability: When regulations or consumer expectations shift, you can modify or replace individual agents\u2014like a compliance bot\u2014without forcing a system-wide overhaul. This piecemeal approach is akin to upgrading an app on your phone rather than reinstalling the entire operating system. The result? A future-proof framework that evolves alongside your business, eliminating massive downtimes or risky reboots.\nYou can\u2019t predict the next AI craze, but you can be ready for it\nGenerative AI was the breakout star a couple of years ago; agentic AI is grabbing the spotlight now. Tomorrow, something else will emerge\u2014because innovation never rests. How then, do we future-proof our architecture so each wave of new technology doesn\u2019t trigger an IT apocalypse? According to a recent Forrester study, 70% of leaders who invested over 100 million dollars in digital initiatives credit one strategy for success: a platform approach.\nInstead of ripping out and replacing old infrastructure each time a new AI paradigm hits, a platform integrates these emerging capabilities as specialized building blocks. When agentic AI arrives, you don\u2019t toss your entire stack\u2014you simply plug in the latest agent modules. This approach means fewer project overruns, quicker deployments, and more consistent outcomes.\nEven better, a robust platform offers end-to-end visibility into each agent\u2019s actions\u2014so you can optimize costs and keep a tighter grip on compute usage. Low-code/no-code interfaces also lower the entry barrier for business users to create and deploy agents, while prebuilt tool and agent libraries accelerate cross-functional workflows, whether in HR, marketing, or any other department.\nPlatforms that support PolyAI architectures and a variety of orchestration frameworks allow you to swap different models, manage prompts and layer new capabilities without rewriting everything from scratch. Being cloud-agnostic, they also eliminate vendor lock-in, letting you tap the best AI services from any provider. In essence, a platform-based approach is your key to orchestrating multi-agent reasoning at scale\u2014without drowning in technical debt or losing agility.\nSo, what are the core elements of this platform approach?\n1. Data: Plugged into a common layer\nWhether you\u2019re implementing LLMs or agentic frameworks, your platform\u2019s data layer remains the cornerstone. If it\u2019s unified, each new AI agent can tap into a curated knowledge base without messy retrofitting.\n2. Models: Swappable brains\nA flexible platform lets you pick specialized models for each use case\u2014financial risk analysis, customer service, healthcare diagnoses\u2014then updates or replaces them without nuking everything else.\n3. Agents: Modular workflows\nAgents thrive as independent yet orchestrated mini-services. If you need a new marketing agent or a compliance agent, you spin it up alongside existing ones, leaving the rest of the system stable.\n4. Governance: Guardrails at scale\nWhen your governance structure is baked into the platform\u2014covering bias checks, audit trails, and regulatory compliance\u2014you remain proactive, not reactive, regardless of which AI \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d you adopt next.\nA platform approach is your strategic hedge against technology\u2019s ceaseless evolution\u2014ensuring that no matter which AI trend takes center stage, you\u2019re ready to integrate, iterate, and innovate.\nStart small and orchestrate your way up\nAgentic AI isn\u2019t entirely new\u2014Tesla\u2019s self-driving cars employs multiple autonomous modules. The difference is that new orchestration frameworks make such multi-agent intelligence widely accessible. No longer confined to specialized hardware or industries, Agentic AI can now be applied to everything from finance to healthcare, fueling renewed mainstream interest and momentum. Design for platform-based readiness.\nStart with a single agent addressing a concrete pain point and expand iteratively. Treat data as a strategic asset, select your models methodically, and bake in transparent governance. That way, each new AI wave integrates seamlessly into your existing infrastructure\u2014boosting agility without constant overhauls.\nWe list the best IT Automation software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner.

Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is an all-in-one website hosting and building platform. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute.

GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point.

Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI voice generators\n1.

Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2.

This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4.

It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

This is especially useful so that no matter where any individual is, they can remain in contact with the rest of their team and provide the latest updates and information that everyone needs.\nProductivity tools also include essential management features, to prioritize schedules and work to deadlines, such as for time management and task management. The also interface needs to be simple and easy to use so that managers do not become bogged down in administrating it all. Additionally, everything needs to be presented in a clear way so that contact management information is easy to find and action.\nThere are also other tools that can help improve productivity and efficiency, simply by making complex tasks simpler and easier to do. This could be anything from managing backups to social media monitoring, or the best CRM software.\nBelow we list what we think are the best productivity apps currently available.\nYour Complete Productivity Suite. Email, Docs, Meetings, and AI in One Place. Upgrade to Google Workspace and save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe\u2019ve also highlighted the best business productivity gadgets.\nThe best productivity tool of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest productivity tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office is probably the platform most people think of first when it comes to office productivity suites, with the cloud-based Microsoft 365 being the latest incarnation.\nWhat ensured that MS Office became a market leader is the comprehensive way data can be covered by different applications and moved between them, making working more efficient and hassle-free. With Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook forming the core programs, these cover everything from documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and emails - in effect covering most essential office needs. In addition to that, OneDrive offers online saving and backups to keep your files safe.\nWhile there are alternatives to MS Office, most rivals attempt to play catch-up with Microsoft rather than provide innovative new features, and MS Office still remains the office suite with the most comprehensive range of features. And even if you do use one of these alternatives, the chances are you are going to be working with document formats created specifically for MS Office, and handle data from customers and suppliers who are using the MS Office platform.\nWhile MS Office does have its critics, the bottom line is that nobody does office productivity better than Microsoft, and the core applications in Office have yet to be bettered.\nThe yearly Personal plan costs around $70 / \u00a365 / AU$105 and includes up to 1 TB of cloud storage per user for up to 5 devices.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest productivity tool for collaboration\nReasons to buy\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nThere are three paid tiers: Premium (priced at around $9 / \u00a310 / AU$15 per user per month when billed annually), Business (costing around $20 / \u00a321 / AU$30 per user per month on a yearly basis) and Enterprise. Premium tracks team projects and includes many extra features such as advanced searches, a workflow builder and custom fields. The Business plan offers everything in Premium plus added resources such as portfolios, advanced reporting and time tracking.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest productivity tool for versatility\nReasons to buy\nTrello is a smartly designed and popular service for managing, organizing and sharing everything from simple to-dos to major project management tasks.\nGetting started is as easy as dragging cards onto a Trello board. Cards can represent single tasks, with priorities and deadlines attached. But they can also be more substantial checklists, with attached files and pictures, containing hyperlinks to point somewhere else.\nAnd there's a whole library of Power-Ups, custom cards which allow you to integrate a host of third-party services into your workflow: Box, Evernote, GIPHY, GitHub, Hangouts, Join.me, Mailchimp, OneDrive, Salesforce, Slack, SmartDraw, SurveyMonkey, Twitter, ZenDesk and more.\nTrello has plenty of collaboration tools to help you manage your projects, and a stack of ingenious features to ensure it's user-friendly. Just one example: the Cloud Aging power-up visibly ages cards if they've not been accessed for a while, fading them out, maybe turning them yellow and even cracking. This isn't just a visual gimmick \u2013 it allows users to instantly see underused cards on even the busiest of boards, a real timesaver.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest productivity tool for features\nReasons to buy\nBitrix24 provides a vast suite of powerful business tools: collaboration, instant messaging, telephony, project management, document handling, scheduling, employee management, and more.\nIf you prefer to keep things simple then you can concentrate on the excellent CRM, which is a capable system all on its own. Contacts and communications are logged, leads assigned to sales managers, emails sent, calls recorded, quotes and invoices issued. Detailed reports keep you up-to-date and there's convenient access via the mobile app.\nBitrix24's unusually generous free account supports 12 users and includes 5GB storage, but if you need more, the Plus account offers more features.\nOverall, Bitrix24 is offers a powerful suite of tools that is especially going to be handy for small businesses and start-ups to help them develop and grow through improved productivity, all in one platform.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review.\nBest free productivity app\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTodoist straddles the categories of time management tools and to-do lists, with an element of project management thrown in for good measure. Despite touching on multiple genres, the tool remains easy to use, making it possible to manage multiple project with ease, and see at a glance what you still have to do.\nThe website or app gives you a daily and weekly overview of what work you have to do, what appointment you have, or whatever else you choose to track. If you're working with a group of people and find that your workload is getting a little heavy, you can delegate tasks to others.\nThe free version limits you to working with five people and having 80 active projects on the go at any one time, and this should be more than enough for most people, but Premium and Business plans are available for a fee. Todoist offers integration with dozens of apps and services so it can tie in neatly to your existing workflow.\nRead our full Todoist review.\n2. RescueTime\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRescueTime not only tracks the time you spend doing different things on your computer or mobile \u2013 such as visiting particular websites or using specific apps \u2013 it does so automatically. Running in the background as it does, RescueTime quietly logs your activity without serving as a distraction.\nIt's possible to set yourself targets and alerts, and the idea is that these goals will help you to develop better working habits. It enables you to see just how you spend your day on your digital devices so you can better understand where the time has gone. There free version of the app enables you to look back at three months of data for analysis, but paid-for packages (which start at $6 per month) have no limits and includes a number of extra features.\nFor most people, the free version will be more than enough, and the fact that it is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and ChromeOS means that it is possible to track work across multiple devices and platforms.\n3. Beeminder\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBeeminder is quite a unique tool that can be used to track and monitor everything from running or trips to the gym, to logging how often you write, or managing a to-do list. Available as an app, or usable online, Beeminder is endlessly flexible \u2013 you define your goal (whatever that may be) and you are tasked with logging your progress. There is a degree of gamification to things here; you're aiming to stick to the 'yellow brick road', which means that, at least on average, you are hitting your targets.\nAnything that can be plotted on a graph can be tracked \u2013 number of words written, number of hours worked, number of contracts signed \u2013 and sticking within the golden zone can be hugely incentivizing. If you're willing to commit fully, you can add your credit card details to your account so you can be fined for failing to stay on track. Beeminder is not for everyone one, but it is so unique, it is well worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.\n4. Toggl\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nToggl is described by its developers as \u2018insanely simple time tracking\u2019, and that's a pretty fair summary. If you take a look at the website, it is the premium versions of the service that are pushed, but there is a free version suitable for teams of up to five people.\nToggl is available for multiple platforms and synchronization means that you can move between devices and stick track your work. There's a lot to explore here, including manual and automated track of activity, a Pomodoro timer, automatic detection of idle time, reminders, integrations with various apps and services and much, much more.\nThe beauty of Toggl, however, is that it is so flexible and customizable. What ever you're looking to monitor, you can probably bend it to your will. The detailed reports are impressive, but it's a bit of shame to see that there is no invoicing option in an otherwise feature-packed tool.\n5. Clockify\nReasons to buy\nClockify grabs the idea of clocking on and off for a shift and runs with it. It is a very simple tool, but that's precisely what will make it so appealing to people \u2013 after all, if you're busy with work, you don't to be overwhelmed with a complex tool for tracking what you're doing!\nClockify is essentially a basic stopwatch so you can easily record how long you spend working on different project. Just start the timers, and you can add labels, descriptions and project details, and just hit stop when you're done. You can configure timers to start as soon as you open your browser so you don't need to remember to do so.\nClockify integrates with Trello, Asana, Jira, Todoist and more, and you can use the website and apps to view details reports and breakdown of how you have spent your time. If you would like to keep Clockify available at all times without the need to dedicate a browser tab to it, you'll be pleased to hear that there is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that keep it just a click away. There are also mobile apps, and desktop versions for macOS, Windows and Linux.\nBest productivity tool FAQs\nWhich productivity tool is best for you?\nWhen deciding which productivity tool to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free platforms may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, free and budget software options can sometimes prove limited when it comes to the variety of tools available, while higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require.\nHow we tested the best productivity tools\nTo test for the best productivity tools we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service.

      "text": "How Agentic AI transforms enterprise automation\nAgentic AI enables secure, adaptive automation within enterprise constraints\nThere\u2019s a lot of noise in enterprise AI right now. Under mounting pressure to deliver faster, safer digital services, businesses are turning to the next evolution in automation: Agentic AI.\nNo, this isn\u2019t bolting on a chatbot and calling it digital transformation. AI agents are built to understand your organization, operating within your domain constraints with real autonomy. These agents operate inside your business, using your data to automate decisions, adapt to real-world problems in milliseconds, and embed themselves directly into operational workflows.\nThey blend the general reasoning power of today\u2019s large language models with domain- specific intelligence grounded in company data. That might be clinical records, compliance frameworks, or engineering logs - whatever your business runs on. The result? Systems that take action: surfacing insights, automating tasks, and adapting based on your company policies and workflows.\nChief Marketing Officer at Vultr.\nWhy it matters now\nDemand for automation is growing, as are expectations around compliance, transparency, and data governance, especially in Europe. Agentic AI offers a response to both: scalable intelligence, designed to work inside complex regulatory frameworks.\nThat matters in sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services, where data security, explainability, and reliability aren't negotiable. These aren\u2019t markets where \u201cgood enough\u201d is acceptable. Customers simply can not tolerate hallucinated responses or unreliable systems where their data hits the public domain.\nAgentic AI is safer. Not because it\u2019s slower or more cautious, but because it\u2019s built for the environment it\u2019s deployed into.\nInside the architecture\nAgentic systems rely on a layered approach, with different types of agents operating across an organization:\n- Human assistance agents support real-time decisions, generating summaries, highlighting next steps, and assisting in code review or sales workflows. They keep humans in control while removing friction from day-to-day tasks.\n- Transactional agents manage system-to-system workflows. They handle onboarding, verification, or inventory reconciliation autonomously when appropriate, with escalation when edge cases arise.\n- Autonomous agents identify and solve problems independently. In domains like DevOps, logistics, or diagnostics, they monitor environments, anticipate failures, and act proactively rather than reactively to resolve these types of issues. These agents work in tandem rather than in isolation. Together, they form an intelligent layer across enterprise systems - learning, adapting, and coordinating actions in ways that were previously siloed or manual. True digital transformation across the enterprise.\nVector-based context\nKey to all of this is the use of custom vector databases. Vector databases enable AI agents to fetch relevant, security-controlled context from sensitive data without actually exposing that data in its original form to the agent. This is a game-changer for regulated industries. Rather than relying on generic training data from the public internet, this draws directly from the institutional knowledge inside your firewalls.\nThat means better accuracy, stronger compliance, and fewer surprises. It also means outputs that reflect your standards, rather than what\u2019s statistically likely.\nEuropean inferencing\nAgentic systems are already transforming highly regulated sectors in Europe. In healthcare, they reduce administrative overheads, improve triage, and accelerate innovation while protecting patient privacy. In manufacturing, they\u2019re powering predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and real-time field service. Within finance, these agents enhance fraud detection, refine compliance, and provide hyper- personalized services.\nAgentic AI adoption is particularly strong in regions with tighter data controls - namely France, Germany, and the Nordics - because these systems respect the boundaries enterprises are required to operate within.\nThese systems increasingly rely on serverless inference, which allows businesses to scale their AI infrastructure without wedding themselves to their maximum theoretical usage. That\u2019s critical in Europe, where innovation budgets are often tight, and sovereign infrastructure matters. Agentic AI is being built to meet those regulatory requirements from day one.\nYes, Europe\u2019s regulatory environment slows things down. But that friction forces better thinking. It pushes enterprises to build with trust, accountability, and explainability. Creating market conditions where sustainable AI can thrive.\nGDPR, the EU AI Act, NIS2 and other regulatory frameworks define the standards by which responsible AI can scale. As US start-ups chase MVPs and launch before the proper guardrails are in place, European enterprises may end up with AI that\u2019s more compliant and generally more effective in the long term.\nThe next step\nAgentic AI marks a turning point in how businesses interact with their data and workflows. It moves beyond static automation to deliver systems that act, learn, and improve within the constraints enterprises define.\nThis is not a plug-and-play future. It\u2019s a future that demands thoughtful design, domain- specific strategy, and an unflinching focus on outcomes. The rewards will be sustainable and significant for the organizations that build smart and scale responsibly. The hype in off-the-shelf, plug-and-play solutions will fade. Agentic AI infrastructure is built for the latest ways of working. Enterprises that invest now and build with intent will lead in the next stage for what\u2019s next.\nWe've featured the best AI writer.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Quire\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nQuire allows you to manage and visualize projects that don\u2019t require advanced functionality.\nQuire works by letting you map out tasks and thoughts in a simple to-do list format that can easily be rearranged and assigned to team members. Once tasks have been defined in the app, you can visually organize and assign these tasks using a Kanban board built into the system. The software makes it easy to flip between task lists and the Kanban board as needed.\nThe beauty of Quire is that it also offers a number of visual representations of your task list that you can choose from, including pie charts, project summaries, and graphs. All the basic visual data representations are there except for Gantt charts, the one strike against this platform.\nOverall, though, Quire delivers a streamlined interface that works very well for exploring workflows and improving project management. It strikes a good balance between simplicity and power, earning it a place among the best data visualization tools available right now.\nBest data visualization tool for flowcharts\n5. Casual\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThere are many ways in which you can visually organize your project. If your preferred style is flowchart-based organization, you\u2019re going to love Casual.\nInstead of Kanban boards or Gantt charts, Casual is built exclusively around a single flowchart interface where you organize projects by drawing lines between tasks, and assign team members to each step in the flowchart. Each team member gets a task list based on the flowchart, but essentially project managers that use Casual track progress through the single-pane flowchart.\nIn terms of price plans, all tiers share the same features. The only differentiating feature is the number of users. For example, the personal tier supports two users while the enterprise tier supports fifty or more. There is currently a free 14-day trial on all tiers, so you can see if it's for you before committing to an ongoing subscription.\nCasual is easily the best data visualization tool if you prefer to work with flowcharts and have a project that can be represented in that format.

      "text": "What Agentic AI really means for enterprise\nBusinesses can unlock unprecedented gains with Agentic AI, but how?\nAutomation has been a cornerstone of industrial revolutions throughout history, driving productivity, efficiency, and profitability. From Britain\u2019s late 18th and 19th-century industrial revolution to the United States\u2019 post-World War II boom, automation has radically transformed economies and societies.\nToday, we stand on the brink of a new wave of automation, powered by agentic AI, which promises to revolutionize business operations in unprecedented ways. In fact, our recent research found that 82% of organizations plan to integrate AI agents by 2027.\nUK Chief Technology & Innovation Officer at Capgemini UK.\nWhat are AI agents, really?\nAI agents are, at their core, software programs that interact with their environment, collect data, and autonomously perform tasks to meet predetermined goals. They represent an evolution from traditional automation technologies like robotic process automation and machine learning that have powered enterprise operations for the past two decades.\nAn agentic AI workflow employs technology such as Large Language Models (LLMs) that perform specific tasks and integrates these in a system that can interact with users and perform tasks autonomously and effectively. Unlike their predecessors, AI agents can perceive, reason, and act in changing environments to achieve their goals, often deciding independently how to reach them, thanks to the explosion in advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in recent years.\nThe benefits of agentic AI in enterprises are widespread. We will undoubtably see enhanced customer service, IT support, and overall business functions because of agentic systems in the coming years. By automating complex tasks and integrating with external tools such as web searches, APIs, and dedicated databases, AI agents can execute more sophisticated tasks and collaborate with each other, driving productivity and efficiency.\nBusinesses can use agentic AI to improve and differentiate their offers to customers ahead of competitors, adding communication channels and styles that appeal to specific customer bases. They will also reduce the cost of operations as trust in agents is built, and human oversight is reduced.\nHow to make AI agents that can transform organizations\nTo build agentic AI systems that deliver real impact and return on investment, businesses have a clear set of tasks. AI agents must have defined roles, need to be able to easily find and locate the data they will use, seamlessly define the tasks or goals they will execute, and set boundaries with guardrails.\nMultiple agents, each with its own specialized role, can cooperate in a decentralized structure to solve more complex tasks collaboratively. For example, in processing insurance claims, one agent verifies documentation, another evaluates policy criteria, and a third processes payments, completing the task jointly and the user only needing to engage with one interface.\nAs organizations transition toward agentic systems, it\u2019s vital that leaders collaborate closely with AI specialists to effectively design and streamline these processes. Integrating AI agents into existing systems can be complex and disruptive if not managed carefully. Building an architecture that accurately reflects real-world activities requires creating digital descriptions and definitions of business operations.\nClearly defined tasks can then be mapped to AI agents as needed. Designing systems for human/AI collaboration needs to be front of mind, ensuring that AI agents collaborate seamlessly with human workers. This involves careful orchestration to maintain human oversight and compliance with safety regulations.\nData quality and optimization is an easily-overlooked element to consider for the entire agentic architecture. Fragmented data will block AI agents from working effectively. Organizations must assess data quality, implement robust governance and security measures, develop pipelines for real-time data availability, and continuously enhance processes through feedback loops.\nGovernance strategies are also essential for managing AI agents. Human intervention must be a safeguard in case decision-making from AI agents appears to be biased, inaccurate, or breaches company ethics. Testing for compliance and failure, including for bias, fairness, and operational performance, is non-negotiable.\nSystematic logging of agent activity, capturing performed tasks, actions taken, evaluation metrics, and the agent\u2019s internal state, is necessary for effective monitoring and error tracing.\nUse of agentic AI across industries\nThe integration of AI agents in various sectors is already underway, and there are huge benefits to be reaped for enterprises. In customer service, we\u2019re seeing AI agents automatically draft responses to customer queries based on historical interaction data, taking ownership of client issues and resolving them without human input.\nFor example, an AI agent can request more information from a customer, analyze the enquiry, and offer a solution, even overriding standard procedures if circumstances justify making an exception. This level of autonomy and adaptability enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nIn financial services, AI agents can create personalized investment strategies and dynamically monitor client portfolios. They can also detect fraud by identifying suspicious transactions and initiating appropriate responses.\nLooking at life sciences, AI agents can support drug discovery by extracting actionable insights from drug mechanisms, disease progression, and clinical outcomes. They can refine clinical trial design and monitor real-time data for mid-trial adjustments, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of research.\nManufacturing and retail sectors can also benefit from AI agents. Smart camera-based process monitoring can improve shopfloor performance and safety compliance, while agentic systems monitor shelves in-store and warehouses, automatically triggering stock replenishment using stock-keeping unit codes.\nThe future of agentic AI\nThe agentic AI future is here, and it\u2019s set to revolutionize business operations. Organizations must seize this moment to review their processes for suitability and unlock unprecedented gains in productivity and cost saving. As expertise in adoption spreads, more sectors will join the agentic AI journey, transforming how we work and interact.\nBy harnessing the autonomous, goal-oriented, and adaptive capabilities of AI agents, enterprises can supercharge their functions and stay ahead of the competition. The future of business is agentic, and the time to embrace this transformative technology is now.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

This means that routine office documents cannot be simply filed in an office, and instead need to be archived online. This is where cloud storage really comes into its own, as many service providers can also accommodate document sharing and syncing for organizations.\nHowever, a Document Management Software (DMS) platform isn't simply about archiving information securely online, as much as making the whole process of document management easier, covering everything from branded templates, improving workflows, working with collaboration tools, as well as being able to sort through sometimes technical information. And that's on top of general document editing and management tasks.\nGood document management software also has to be able to work with different digital file types, not just from office software, images and designs, and anything else you could imagine previously being printed on paper, including from legacy file formats. These days it will also cater for online document e-signing software .\nHowever, a lot of suppliers and contractors will still deal with paper, so any DMS needs to have a document scanning solution, often working as a standalone or part of an OCR scanning software package, so that any such paper invoices, receipts, or other documents can be scanned so that a digital copy can be archived while the paper version is recycled.\nThe paperless office has been a long-time in coming, but it's finally here for those who want to embrace it. Below we list the best document management software solutions currently available.\nWe've also featured the best alternatives to Microsoft Office.\nThe best document management software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest document management software for business\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDocHub offers a complete document management software solution, letting users handle a wide range of tasks through the online service.\nWe were quite impressed when we reviewed the service, finding it a feature-rich solution for businesses. Of course, this includes essentials like collaboration tools, electronic signatures and filling in forms. But there\u2019s also unlimited cloud storage for documents (a rarity), integration with Google and Dropbox, and the ability to edit and modify digital documents. In other words, this is the complete package.\nWith a user-friendly interface, getting around DocHub is very simple, very intuitive. If you\u2019re looking for free document management software, DocHub does include this option. However, it\u2019s limited to five eSignatures and three sign requests a month, with other limitations attached. Great for trying the service to see if it\u2019s right for you, but to get the most from it, you\u2019ll likely want to opt for the monthly/annual subscription, DocHub Pro, which starts at $10 a month on an annual plan. This includes unlimited eSignatures, sign requests, and more.\nRead our full DocHub review\nBest document management software for complex workflows\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPandaDoc offers a lot more than just the option to fill in forms and sign docs. The software allows you to create complex documents from scratch and track their progress from the very beginning to the signing of contracts.\nYou can choose the pre-made templates or go with a blank slate. Either way, you have a very powerful layout designer in your hands. It\u2019s really flexible as you can easily add videos, images, and similar as well as make a simple text document.\nPandaDoc has several pricing plans with the cheapest one called Essentials. This gets you unlimited document uploads and e-signatures, real-time tracking and notifications, rich media drag-and-drop document editor, document analytics, and a few more things.\nNext in line is the Business plan which adds some more goodies, including CRM and Zapier integrations, custom branding, a content library, and more. There\u2019s also an Enterprise option for large companies with complex document workflows, and for that, you need to contact the sales department directly.\nTo create an account you\u2019ll need your email, name, phone, and some details regarding your business or company. The software doesn\u2019t ask you to create your own signature when creating the account, instead, you\u2019ll have to find that on your own by going to the profile settings. From there you can then pick the font and color of your signature.\nApart from being available on desktop, PandaDoc also has apps for Android and iOS.\nRead our full PandaDoc review.\nBest document management software for automated workflows\nReasons to buy\nWhen it comes to document management, M-Files aims to improve internal workflows, and to ensure important information is kept secure at all times. Its customers include many large corporations such as Comcast and Yokohama.\nThere\u2019s a single vault for a plethora of files, and you can easily find them by client, project, date, status or other criteria. The software aims to avoid duplication \u2013 it\u2019s quite common to end up with two copies of the same report, or possibly more.\nM-Files will alert you if a document has been saved twice by analyzing names and project data. You get some great integrations too, including Microsoft Office and Salesforce CRM.\nThere is a free trial available, but pricing isn\u2019t stipulated on the site, so you have to get in touch for a quote.\nRead our full M-Files review\nBest document management software for digital workspaces\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDocuWare takes a cloud-based approach to document management. It integrates cloud storage and office automation to create a digital workplace. This paperless approach to the full spectrum of office tasks is another example of the digital transformation which is driving many processes these days.\nDocuWare offers services to create a \u2018cloud workflow\u2019 when it comes to documents. It allows services to be purchased on a small scale as needed, and then as use-case scenarios are created, and reliability is ensured, the service can be scaled up for a larger deployment.\nMobile apps that can integrate into this workflow are also offered, facilitating the likes of scanning receipts on the go, approving invoices for speedy payment, and signing forms directly on the device.\nWhile DocuWare does offer a demo and free trial, the pricing of course, depends on the services chosen, therefore requiring the prospective buyer to get in touch for a custom quote.\nRead our full DocuWare review\nBest all-in-one document management software\n5. Templafy\nReasons to buy\nTemplafy is one of the best document management tools out there. The system aims to integrate essential office suites and solutions used by businesses on a daily basis.\nIf there\u2019s one thing that can be frustrating, it\u2019s having to create brand documents using different software. This can become time-consuming and fragmented, but Templafy can help. With it, you can create a range of files within the system and manage them from a single feed.\nThe software is compatible with a range of devices and uses the cloud to let you access all your documents across computers, tablets and smartphones. There are also automatic compliance checks, and you can give feedback to employees easily, too.\nContact is required for a pricing quote, and not surprisingly, the exact cost depends on the number of users, features and add-ons chosen.\nBest document management software for compliance\n6. MasterControl\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWithin big organizations, there are often processes and regulations put in place to ensure documents are compliant and follow company guidelines. But when you have a ton of files, it can be hard to follow such rules.\nMasterControl Document Control Software, which is used by some of the world\u2019s largest regulatory bodies, is document management software that addresses complex regulations and standards around the globe. It aims to reduce compliance cost and increase internal efficiency.\nThe system fully automates routing, delivery, escalation and approval of vital documents. It also sports a centralized, secure archive where you can store and search for business files.\nThere is no indication of a free trial, and pricing requires contacting the company for a quote.\nBest document management software for collaboration\n7. XaitPorter\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019re looking for a cloud solution for creating documents, then you should definitely check out XaitPorter.\nThe great thing about this system is that it\u2019s extremely flexible. You\u2019re able to collaborate and work on documents with colleagues simultaneously, and you can easily share feedback with each other. It also manages all aspects of workflow, so you don\u2019t have to worry about formatting, numbering and layout.\nXaitPorter has some useful tricks on the integrations front, as well. The software can work with Salesforce, Oracle, SAS, Microsoft 365, OpenText and Dropbox. And it\u2019s currently used by over 45,000 firms across the globe.\nWhile there is a demo available, there is no free trial, and pricing requires getting in touch for a quote.\nAlso consider these document management solutions:\nWhile there are a number of dedicated office and document platforms we could mention, not least Office 365, LibreOffice, and Adobe Document Cloud, these are more focused on creating documents and managing those, rather than managing and storing documents from multiple sources and formats. Therefore we'll continue this list by featuring some of the other DMS solutions worth considering:\nSamepage is a little different to standard document management as it's more about creating a single focal point for all communications, projects, and document sharing tools. The aim is to simplify everything in a single app as opposed to having multiple software applications for different tasks. The interface is simple and easy to use, with collaboration built into the heart of it. In that regard it makes Samepage a potentially flexible solution to cover multiple needs.\nDokmee advertises itself as an enterprise content management solution, to organize, secure, and manage files. It supports a number of document formats, and also provides document imaging and data capture as part of its service. Everything can be smartly indexed using AI, with files automatically stamped for indexing, as well as rules-based routing to make storage and archiving easier, which is all done through secure hosting in the cloud. As expected, collaboration is supported, with permissions and auditing options available for easier file management.\neFileCabinet is a document management software solution that uses smart automation to organize, name, and store files according to their content. Templates are available to customize the document folder tree throughout your system. Permissions, file/folder expiration, and notifications can also be set up for file sharing and for sending file requests, all of which is done using a secure URL. General accessibility rules can also be set up according to company policy.\nAbbyy are perhaps most famous for their file reader and scanning services, but they also provide a digital document archiving service which allows for the secure storage and use of documents. Access can be tracked and logged, and existing documents can be reused and edited as required for reissue. Meta keywords can be applied for easy search on top of normal search functions, and distributed easily via the web or email as required. One potential limitation is that Abbyy services are primarily built to store documents in PDF format.\nBest document management software: FAQs\nWhich document management software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which document management software to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget-priced software options can sometimes prove limited when it comes to the variety of tools available, while higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require.\nHow we tested the best document management software\nOur team of experts have tested a wide range of essential office software, including the best PDF editors and the best eSignature software. Whether we're looking at CRMs or DMS, we take the same rigorous review process to test out these tools.\nTo test for the best document management software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

He has spent over 7 years testing website builders, building websites using AI, and writing extensively about business and marketing topics.\nDuring his time at TechRadar, Owain has been invited to speak and live blog from some of the top website builder events and has interviewed key executives from the best website builders including Wix, Hostinger, Squarespace, and GoDaddy.\nHow we pick the best AI website builder\nJust because a website builder leverages AI doesn't automatically make it better than other options. AI is just a tool, and like all tools, it is how platforms apply it that dictates its value.\nOur team of experts have tested and reviewed 80+ website builders, combining extensive desk based research with hours of hands-on experience. Here is what we look for when finding and ranking the AI website builders in this guide:\nEase-of-use\nThe majority of website builders are targeted at beginners, helping them to create a website with no or little coding knowledge required. So, ease of use is one of the biggest factors that we assess when picking the best AI website builders.\nIf the AI website builder we are testing is complex or counterintuitive, this can negatively impact its score.\nSpeed\nOne major benefit of using an AI website builder is the time it will save you. So, if the platform requires you to take any lengthy or unnecessary steps, this can negatively affect the experience and therefore impact how we rate the platform.\nAll websites built by AI will need some level of editing in order to make it fit to represent your business online. This can range from making small adjustments through to practically starting from scratch. During the testing process we assess the speed of AI website generation, this includes seeing how long the AI tajes to produce a website and how much much editing time may be required to reach your finished product.\nNote: The results of an AI-powered website builder are often dependent on the input. Typically, the more information you give the AI, the more closely the end result will match what you have in mind.\nResults\nUltimately, unless the website you end up with looks great and works smoothly, it isn't fit for purpose.\nWe get hands-on experience with every AI website builder we review, putting it through its paces to see how well our website turns out. Then, we ask questions about the results such as:\nHow good does the website look? Is it bespoke to our needs? What is the quality of AI-generated content produced? How well does the website work?\nOverall experience\nWhen it comes to website builders AI is often part of a much larger website building experience. When testing AI website builders, we call upon our extensive knowledge to offer insight into the wider experience on offer from the platform.\nThis will include looking at the overarching website editing experience and additional features such as SEO and blogging tools - many of which are also AI-powered.\nValue for money\nFinally, we research whether the AI tools a platform offers are available on all or just some plans. We then assess the value for money those plans offer.\nBest in class\nAll of the AI website builders we recommend on this list are suitable for most users. However, we also consider each on its unique merits and offer a 'best in class' title to highlight who may benefit most from each one.\nFor example, Squarespace is well-known for its stunning templates and popularity amongst freelancers, designers, artists, and photographer. With this in mind, we have awarded Squarespace as the best AI website builder for creatives.\nYou can find out more about how we test website builders in our full guide.\nHow to choose the best AI website builder\nThere is an awful lot of hype around AI website builders, so it can be easy to get confused. This short guide will ensure you get the most out of AI when selecting a website builder.\nYour goals\nStart by detailing what you want to achieve. In many cases, this will help you quickly eliminate some options and add the rest to your short list. For example, if you are looking to sell online, then picking a website builder with advanced ecommerce features is going to be important.\n1. Define your budget\nNext you can remove any options that don\u2019t meet your budget. After all, it doesn\u2019t really matter how good a website builder is if paying for it seriously eats into your profit each month.\nWhat level of customization is offered after AI generation?\n2. Test the user experience\nOnce you have whittled down your options, try getting hands on with the website builders. Many builders offer a free option or a free trial. Test out all the features, see if you can create a site that looks and works how you want, ask yourself how intuitive you find the AI prompting process, and ensure that it isn\u2019t lacking in any key areas.\n3. Assess the results\nUltimately, if your website isn\u2019t going to look great and offer a great user experience at the end of the process, then the website builder you choose isn\u2019t worth the investment.\nLuckily, an AI website builder will usually let you create the basis of your website within seconds, making it quick and easy to get a fair idea of what your website will look/work like. There is little worse than spending hours building your website, only to find you can't get it to look and work like you want it to.\n4. Try out additional AI tools\nOnce you have tested the website builder and reviewed the results, ask yourself what level of customization is offered after AI generation?\nMany website builders also offer other AI-powered tools that can make building and managing your website quicker and easier. These tools range from AI content and image creation to AI powered alt text and page description generation.\nYou should also consider which other, non AI powered tools you may need to help you achieve your goals and their availability on the platforms you are considering.\nWant to know how more about how to pick the best website builder? We asked the experts.\nBest AI website builders FAQs\nWhat is an AI website builder?\nAn AI website builder is a tool that uses artificial intelligence technology to simplify the website creation process. It employs sophisticated algorithms and machine learning capabilities to guide users through the entire website creation process.\nBy automating tasks such as content generation, design customization, and even SEO optimization, AI website builders enable users to build beautiful and professional-looking websites with minimal effort and technical expertise.\nAs a rule, these platforms provide a wide variety of customizable templates and other options, ensuring that users can create unique and engaging websites tailored to their specific needs.\nTo learn more you can read our fill guide to what is an AI website builder?\nAre there any limitations to using AI website builders?\nAI website builders come with many of the same benefits and limitations of using a normal website builder.\nFor example, using an AI website builder makes the website building process much quicker and easier than coding a website from scratch. However, it can also limit the level of customization and flexibility you have over your website\u2019s design and functionality.\nAI website builders can also be a little more expensive when compared to a traditional route of picking one of the best web hosting providers and coding your own site.\nMany businesses are happy to accept these limitations in exchange for the convenience and ease of use that an AI website builder offers.\nHow do AI website builders work?\nEach AI website builder on this list works in a slightly different way.\nSome, such as Squarespace, take a multiple choice approach where you can select the answers that most closely match what you are looking for. This approach is great for those who may not have a clear vision for their website and need some guidance. Others, such as Wix, use a chatbot approach where you are asked questions and then can answer them however you want. This is a good approach if you know exactly what you are looking for and find it easy to translate your vision into words.\nOnce the AI website builder has collected all the information it needs via one of the methods outlined above, it will then generate a template, text, and images based on that information.\nWhich AI website builder comes with a free domain?\nMany of the platforms in this guide come with a free domain. This includes Wix, Hostinger, Squarespace, Duda, and Jimdo.\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that all of these only offer a free domain for the first year, so you will need to pay extra for the review from year 2 and beyond.\nWhich AI website builder is best?\nWix offers the best AI website builder on the market. It earns this spot thanks to its extensive range of AI tools, including a full AI website builder, AI image and text creators, AI marketing assistant, and AI layout tool. With premium plans starting at $17/mo, it is also highly affordable.\nDo I actually need an AI website builder?\nUsing an AI website builder often requires a trade off. Using one will undeniably make the website building process faster, letting you focus on other important parts of the business. However, using one can also be a little more restrictive than using a non-AI website builder, meaning they aren\u2019t best suited for everyone.\nEntrepreneurs and small businesses can benefit from AI website builders as it allows them to complete an essential task efficiently. Agencies can also benefit as it allows them to speed up the repetitive tasks they undertake on a daily basis.\nUltimately, an AI website builder isn\u2019t essential, but can be very beneficial in many cases.\nWill I need to edit my AI built website?\nAlthough AI can create a website for you that is fully populated with images and text, this tends to offer you a starting point, rather than a finished product. You will almost certainly need to edit this content in order to bring it in line with your brand and make your website look and feel the way you want it to.\nWhat makes the best AI website builder?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to naming the best AI website builder. In this guide I give Wix the top spot because it is the best option for most people, in most cases. This, of course, doesn't always mean it is the right option for you.\nHowever, the best AI website builders do all have some similar features in common. For example, they will all include tools that make it easy for those with no coding knowledge to quickly and easily build a website that meets their needs.\nWebsite builder vs AI website builder: What\u2019s the difference?\nThe main difference between a traditional website builder and an AI-powered one lies in the technology used. While a traditional website builder provides standard tools for website creation, an AI website builder leverages artificial intelligence to streamline the process further.\nUnlike standard site builders, AI-powered ones can offer personalized design recommendations based on user preferences and industry-specific best practices. They often provide automated content creation, image optimization, and even intelligent SEO guidance, significantly streamlining the website development process. This results in a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, allowing users to create sophisticated and visually appealing websites that are optimized for a seamless online presence and enhanced user engagement.\nRead a full comparison in our guide to standard website builders vs AI.\nWhat is the best AI website builder for beginners?\nFor beginners, an ideal AI website builder offers a combination of user-friendly features and comprehensive guidance throughout the website creation journey.\nPlatforms like Wix, Hostinger, and GoDaddy are popular and rock-solid choices, providing intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces, extensive template libraries, and responsive customer support to assist beginners at every step.\nThese AI-powered platforms also offer additional resources such as step-by-step guides, informative blogs, and community forums, enabling users to learn and grow their website development skills effectively. With a focus on simplicity and accessibility, these AI website builders can empower beginners to build striking websites that reflect their unique brand identity and the vision behind them.\nCan I build a website with ChatGPT?\nYes, in theory you can build a website using ChatGPT. However, there are some limitations to doing so.\nWhen you use a dedicated AI website builder it will walk you step-by-step through everything you need to know and do in order to create a website. These platform focus on making it as quick and easy as possible to create a great website, doing lots behind the scenes to create a seamless process for you.\nAs ChatGPT hasn't been built specifically to deal with website building, you will need to create your own plan on how you will approach building a website with the tool. The process will also likely take a lot of testing in order to discover excacly how to get the outputs you desire.\nYou will also need to deal with sourcing platforms for coding and your own web hosting as, although ChatGPT may be able to advise on you the best options, it cannot sign up and pay for the hosting for you.\nUltimately, building a website with ChatGPT may save you a small amount of cash, but it is likely to take a considerable amount of additional time to launch, manage, and maintain your website.\nIf you want to learn more about how you can build a website with ChatGPT check out what one of our reviewers thought when they created a website using ChatGPT.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOwain has been building websites and online stores for his own and his client's businesses for over 8 years.

      "text": "Best online collaboration tool of 2025\nSoftware for teams\nWe list the best online collaboration software, to make it simple and easy for teams to work together.\nAlthough collaboration tools had already been set up for office teams, the pandemic and subsequent lock down that saw many people working remotely has lead to a resurgence in collaboration tool features. The result is that collaboration has become the new normal in the workplace.\nSince employees can no longer be expected to work from the same location, this means the ability for teams to share, use, and edit files at a distance has become essential for productivity.\nHowever, collaboration tools aren't simply limited to office software such as Microsoft docs and spreadsheets, but could be anything from using cloud document storage for managing daily tasks, to video conferencing for online meetings. Even better is that the best collaboration tools will work just as well on mobile devices as well as desktops and laptops.\nAbove all, everything should be clear, easy to understand, simply to use and reduce misunderstanding. Every employee should be empowered to be able to speak to the right person, wherever they are in the company, to address the same problem. And then solve that problem within an acceptable workflow.\nThe days of collaborative working are here, so below we list what we think are the best collaboration tools currently available.\nThe Future of Teamwork. Co-create in Real-Time with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Start Your Google Workspace Free Trial. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe've also featured the best task management apps.\nThe best online collaboration tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online collaboration tool for comms\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSlack is without doubt a mighty collaboration tool, with millions of users around the globe. It\u2019s an incredibly smart platform, and you can get it on mobile and desktop devices. It allows for the sending of direct messages (DMs) and files to a single person or a group of employees, and there\u2019s the ability to organize conversations into different channels (perhaps for specific projects, one for technical support, general chat, and so forth).\nThe app also supports video calling. You can use the feature to talk to your colleagues about projects and work in-depth, without having to type everything into a DM. While this isn\u2019t a replacement for cloud storage services, you are able to drag, drop and share files with your colleagues directly within Slack. It\u2019s also compatible with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.\nTo round things off, Slack even has a free version, although unsurprisingly it has limitations (in terms of the number of messages stored, overall storage space and so forth).\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest online collaboration tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office may not be the first platform you think of when it comes to collaboration, but this now runs at the heart of the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office suite.\nThis is important because Microsoft Office remains the most used and therefore important office suite out there, and while there are competitors such as OpenOffice and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) they still haven't caught up to the same level of functionality and ease of use.\nTherefore as Microsoft Office is likely to be at the heart of many businesses, the move to Microsoft 365 offers a number of advantages, not least the ability for teams to collaborate directly on the same set of documents. This could be anything from work shifts in an Excel spreadsheet, to a presentation in PowerPoint, to client reports written in Word.\nAdded to this is that Microsoft Teams now comes bundled with a number of Microsoft 365 packages, allowing for Unified Communications integrated with the traditional office software.\nWhat makes Microsoft 365 more attractive is that as a cloud-hosted platform it can be used not just with Windows, but also Mac, Android, and iOS.\nOverall, Microsoft 365 doesn't simply offer a great office suite, but one that is also firmly designed for collaboration and sharing with teams.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest all-in-one online collaboration tool\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMiro is one of those online tools that aims to bridge the gap between traditional office working and the modern hybrid routine that many of us are familiar with. It is best described as a multipurpose online collaboration tool, and its list of features is pretty extensive stretching beyond the typical realms of similar software.\nThe majority of the work you\u2019ll end up doing in Miro will revolve around what it calls boards, which start off as entirely blank spaces. Setting one up from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming, which is why the company has designed templates that you can pick from the get-go.\nSome of its most commonly accessed templates include mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, product roadmaps, and timelines. Many of these will serve well as project management tools, and anybody familiar with other project management software like Airtable or Trello will already be familiar with how they work.\nOverall, we think Miro is hard to beat. Its long list of features should cover all parts of a typical business process from research and design to presentation, and its collaboration abilities are second to none. Furthermore, its transparency around security and reasonable pricing make it hard for us not to recommend it. The only thing we could wish for is better support channels.\nRead our full Miro review.\nBest online collaboration tool for tracking\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest online collaboration tool for organizing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have ever looked into project management software and online collaboration tools, then no doubt you\u2019ve come across Trello. Available on the web and with mobile apps, it lets you easily organize projects and work on them with colleagues.\nThe platform allows you to work with boards or lists, which can be organized by teams and different tasks. And within these, you can set up to-do lists and delegate amongst colleagues. There\u2019s also the option to assign comments to cards \u2013 a quick way to give feedback to others.\nFurthermore, Trello boasts a number of integrations with apps such as Evernote, GitHub, Google Drive and Slack. You can download the app for free, but there are premium options available which give access to more features.\nThe Premium pricing tier unlocks a number of additional administrative features for better organization. There's also an Enterprise edition which is priced according to the number of users required, and provides some additional organizational management features.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest online collaboration tool space\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Workspace (formerly called G Suite) is Google's answer to Microsoft 365, and more. This is one of the best platforms you can choose for an organization because it comes with a lot of features.\nThink of this software as the enterprise version of all the popular Google tools you use. For instance, you can create custom business emails for staff that uses the same interface as the popular Gmail app. People can create and edit documents collaboratively on Google Docs; you\u2019ll see any changes in real time, and anyone is free to make comments and suggestions for any changes.\nThere's Meet, a video-conferencing solution for enterprises; this tool for valuable for colleagues to stay in touch with each other, especially for remote companies. There\u2019s also Google Chat, a messaging tool for enterprises; Google Drive for file sharing; Google Sheets for spreadsheets; and a shared calendar tool that enables colleagues to keep tabs on each other\u2019s schedules. These tools are what you\u2019ll get access to as a Google Workspace subscriber.\nA Starter plan includes 30GB storage per user and a maximum of 100 participants in video meetings. The Standard plan includes 2TB of storage and up to 150 participants in video meetings. The Plus plan includes 5TB of storage per user and up to 500 participants in video meetings. There's also an Enterprise plan that offers as much storage and video meeting participants as you need; this plan has no standard pricing, so you'll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nYou can save on your Google Workspace subscription with our Google Workspace promo codes.\nRead our full Google Workspace review.\nBest online collaboration tool for mobile\nReasons to buy\nPodio describes itself as a flexible and customizable online platform for work and communication among teams. In other words, it gives you a way to organize large stacks of work and to delegate tasks between employees.\nJust like many of the other business collaboration apps out there, Podio provides you with the tools to share files, view the status of ongoing projects and get feedback on the things you\u2019re currently working on. These functionalities are combined into an easy-to-use interface.\nPodio is also equipped with quality mobile apps for when you\u2019re out and about, and need to use your smartphone or tablet, and it has an impressive amount of integration with third-party services and apps including Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and Zendesk.\nRead our full Podio review.\nBest online collaboration tool for ease-of-use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRyver is similar to Slack, aiming to give your organization a highly effective means of communication, and an easy way to talk over tasks, ensuring that deadlines are met.\nWhat makes Ryver a compelling option is the fact that you can create as many teams as you want within the app, and easily categorize them to boot. As is the case with Slack, you can use the platform to set up chats with groups and individuals.\nThere are some interesting filters, too. You can control who sees the things you say and post in the app, and obviously enough, join the teams that are most relevant to you. All company posts are located within a Facebook-style newsfeed, and you can mark posts to come back to them later on.\nThere\u2019s also a host of native clients across mobile and desktop, including Mac and Linux. There's also a premium version for enterprise which offers workflow automation, Single Sign-On (SSO), and advanced team management.\nRead our full Ryver review.\nBest online collaboration platform\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAirtable is a platform that supports extensive online collaboration and project management. You can use it to share data seamlessly within an organization for people to collaborate. This platform has extensive third-party integration, so you can sync data from other apps and ensure it is always up-to-date.\nAirtable is not just a standalone collaborative tool. It is actually a platform on which people can build collaborative apps. It touts itself as \u201clow-code\u201d, meaning you don\u2019t need sophisticated programming skills to build apps on it, although a little will help. Anyone in your organization can build an app on Airtable to foster collaboration.\nYou can start with the free plan, which has limitations on the file sizes and the number of collaborators. Thus, you\u2019ll need a paid plan to maximize your use of this platform, and you can choose from one of three such plans; Plus, Pro, and Enterprise.\nThe Plus plan supports an unlimited number of users. The limitation is that you'll get a maximum of 5GB space per base (which refers to a project) and a maximum of 5,000 records for each base. The Pro plan increases the storage space to 20GB per base with a maximum of 50,000 records for each base. The Enterprise plan is the highest, giving you up to 1TB of space per base and 100,000 records; this plan has no standard pricing, so you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nRead our full Airtable review.\nBest online collaboration tool for designers\n10. InVision\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInVision is a collaborative tool built for designers. It provides a virtual whiteboard where multiple collaborators can share their design ideas and thoughts to come up with solutions. This whiteboard allows real-time interaction so that teams within an organization can brainstorm about work-related activities.\nThe whiteboard is called Freehand, owing its name to the fact people usually use their hands to write on whiteboards.
