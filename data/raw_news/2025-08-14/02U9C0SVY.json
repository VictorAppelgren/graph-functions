  "description": "What you can learn from my mistake \u2014 and from thousands of others.",
  "content": "As I posted in this column previously, I was in a debilitating electric scooter accident back in April \u2013 toppling over the handlebars and smacking my head on the ground. Accomplished at riding these vehicles and feeling invincible, I was shocked as anyone at the extent of damage in my right elbow as a result of the fall. Essentially the nerve up and down my arm popped out of its channel. The pain was excruciating, constant and inescapable. But I\u2019m back, baby. After 10 weeks or so of physical therapy sessions and monotonous daily exercises, the nerve finally returned to its proper place. I almost never feel the numbness or pain anymore.\n\nI\u2019m back working. I can sit in a car again. I can sleep on my right side. I can use a fork to eat. I can hit a golf ball, play pickleball, and even ride my bike again. What I won\u2019t be doing: Going on an electric scooter.\n\nApparently my experience is not isolated. In a new study, ERideHero sourced electric scooter injury data from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's NEISS Database, which collects data on consumer product-related injuries from a sample of 100+ American E.R. departments. The database provides weighting scores for each injury entry, which allowed officials to extrapolate estimates\n\nThe result: In 2024, the number of e-scooter injuries rose by 80 percent, from 64,312 to 115,713. In truth, there were probably a lot more if people like me didn\u2019t report any to emergency rooms. Scary. And maybe because they ride more than older people \u2013 or because they\u2019re less versed at it \u2013 children are incurring a higher proportion of e-scooter injuries. Kids younger than 15 had more than double the number of accidents in 2024, from the year before. The age group that suffers the most injuries is 15-to-24-year-olds. More than 10,000 injuries involved riders under the influence last year, as well \u2013 68 percent of alcohol-related e-scooter injuries result in head trauma, compared to just 28 percent among non-alcohol-related injuries.\n\nThe study also points out that recent research suggests it\u2019s not that electric scooters are intrinsically dangerous, but that it\u2019s the behavior or riding style of the users that keeps injury levels high among riders and pedestrians alike. If someone isn\u2019t looking \u2013 while riding or walking \u2013 that can be a recipe for disaster. I witnessed one such incident in downtown San Diego in which an elderly person stepped off a curb and never saw a scooter rider who was flying by. Lots of blood, but somehow the pedestrian was able to walk away.\n\nThe study also revealed that helmets save lives \u2013 18.42 percent (20,960) of all e-scooter injuries in 2024 were head injuries. This doesn\u2019t include injuries to the face and sensory organs. In fact, the head and joints of the extremities commonly take the brunt of a fall. In descending order, the head, face, knee, shoulder and wrist were the top five body parts injured. The elbow \u2013 as in my case \u2013 was sixth.\n\nAs for when these accidents tend to happen, it\u2019s on the weekends when I\u2019m guessing more people are riding them. Some 16.29 percent of all e-scooter injuries in 2024 occurred on a Saturday, while 15.12 percent occurred on Sunday.\n\nWhat to make of all this: If you\u2019re going to ride an electric scooter, be smart and alert. Watch the pathway ahead of you. Don\u2019t go too fast. And wear some padding. I\u2019m guessing I\u2019ve ridden e-scooters nearly 1,000 times over the past seven years. And if I can fall, anyone can.",

      "text": "Electric Scooter Accident Report 2025\nConvenience comes at a cost that is not always clear from a product\u2019s sales tag.\nWith cars and planes, a large part of that cost is the environmental toll the vehicles continue to take. But in the case of electric scooters \u2014 which have the potential to reduce transport\u2019s toll on the environment \u2014 the cost is felt through an alarming growth in road injuries.\nOne study from UCLA found that the annual cost of e-scooter and bicycle hospitalizations rose nearly five times over between 2016 and 2024, as micromobility entered the mainstream. It also found that e-scooter injuries are more likely to involve bone fractures, paralysis or major surgery than bike injuries, and are more likely to happen to the young.\nAnd yet, there is evidence that much of this danger is avoidable. Other studies have shown that e-scooter riders are less likely to wear helmets and more likely to drink alcohol before driving, compared to other traditional and modern forms of micromobility. These are simple safety warnings to heed, and they are the norm for other forms of motorized transportation.\nTo draw attention to the dangers that come with the pleasure and convenience of e-scooter use, ERideHero analyzed the latest available figures on electric scooter injuries in the U.S. and identified the trends these injuries are following.\nWhat We Did\nWe sourced electric scooter injury data from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission's NEISS Database, which collects data on consumer product-related injuries from a sample of over 100 American ER departments. The database provides weighting scores for each injury entry, which allowed us to extrapolate estimates for the whole of the U.S. We sourced the global data on electric scooter road accidents manually from reputable news sources.\nKey Findings\n- The number of under-15s injured by electric scooters more than doubled to 17,641 in 2024.\n- The age group that suffers the most electronic scooter injuries is 15-24 year olds (23.24%).\n- 20,960 or 18.42% of all electronic scooter injuries in 2024 were head injuries.\n- Some 67.70% of electric scooter injuries in 2024 happened to males.\n- New Zealand had 654 electric scooter road accidents per million people in 2024 \u2014 in the U.S., the figure was 20 per million.\nE-scooter Injuries Rose by 80% Last Year\nFirst, we looked at the rise in the total number of U.S. e-scooter injuries over the past five years. Overall, the figure has risen 3.94 times from 29,344 in 2020 to 115,713 in 2024. The decade began with a 74% rise in injuries between 2020 and 2021, as ride shares emerged from a COVID-19 slump and the total number of shared micromobility trips since 2010 passed half a billion.\n\u201cWell-designed micromobility programs mean safer, more sustainable and resilient cities,\u201d said Corinne Kisner, Executive Director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) at the time. \u201cBy redesigning streets, lowering speeds, and prioritizing bikeway projects, local leaders can ensure that the bike and scooter boom continues to gain momentum, connecting people to the opportunities in their cities.\u201d\nHowever, while injury numbers rose by just 12% in each of the following two years, there was a shock around the corner. Between 2023 and 2024, the number of electric scooter injuries rose by 80% from 64,312 to 115,713. And recent research suggests that it is not that electric scooters are intrinsically dangerous, but that it is the behavior or riding style of their users that keeps injury levels high among riders and pedestrians alike.\n\u201cJust a step or two out the doorway I walk out and just boom. I landed right on my hip, I could hear it and feel, and I thought that's bad,\u201d pedestrian John Stamstad, victim of a hit-and-run scooter in Seattle, told King 5 News. \u201cThere was a bike lane just like, 10 feet out. I don\u2019t think the person was malicious, but he was negligent.\u201d\nChildren Are Incurring A Higher Proportion of E-scooter Injuries\nNext, we looked at how different age groups are represented in the e-scooter injury statistics. We began by examining the rise in the number of children suffering such injuries.\nThe number of injuries among under-sixes has risen 2.39 times since 2020; 2.95 times among all under-11s; and 4.85 times among all under-15s. In the last year alone, the number of children under 15 injured rose by 116% from 8,159 to 17,641.\nWe also discovered a troubling trend in injuries among children. Not only is the number of children injured by e-scooters rising dramatically each year, but the proportion of injuries that happen to under-15s has also risen, compared to other age groups. In 2024, 15.26% of all U.S. e-scooter injuries happened to those who are 14 or younger, up from 12.69% in 2023 and 10.68% in 2021.\nE-scooter injuries are generally weighted towards younger generations, with the 15-24 age-group incurring 23.24% of all injuries \u2014 just a few decimal points ahead of the second most affected age-group, 25-34-year-olds. The 0-14 age group incurs more injuries than any group from age 35 upwards.\nThe trend of young people being injured by e-scooters may be occurring as the market broadens, e-scooter use becomes \u2018normal\u2019 and cheaper or second-hand scooters become appealing gifts from parents to children.\nSome parents seem to have bought their kids e-scooters without realizing that they can go from zero to 40 km/h in seconds, says Daniel Rosenfield, a pediatric emergency physician. \u201cFrom an emotional and cognitive perspective \u2014 where you just have the ability to understand where your body is in space, how you can make turns, what's far ahead and what's not \u2014 [it is] similar to driving a car.\u201d\nE-scooter Users Are Statistically Most Likely to Damage Heads\nOne refrain that repeatedly emerges in e-scooter research is that helmets save lives. This is underlined by our own analysis, which found that 20,960, or 18.42%, of all e-scooter injuries in 2024 were head injuries \u2014 and this doesn\u2019t include injuries to the face and sensory organs. We\u2019ve mapped out the prevalence of injuries to each body part below: the head and joints of the extremities all commonly taking the brunt of a fall.\n\u201cKids need to be in appropriate safety gear,\u201d said pediatric emergency medicine physician Dr. Meghan Martin. \u201cThey should be wearing helmets, they should be wearing not flipflops or sandals but full foot sneakers, covered shoes, covered toes. They should also be in long pants, long sleeves, in case they were to crash.\u201d\n\u201cWith the introduction of e-scooters and e-bikes, we've certainly seen different types of injuries than we've seen in the past,\u201d said Dr. Graham King, St. Joseph's Health Care London's Chief of Surgery at the Roth McFarlane Hand & Upper Limb Centre. \u201cA lot of facial fractures from falling and hitting your face or head.\n\u201cThey can also be open fractures because the force is so high. These things go up to 30 kilometres per hour or more. When they hit the ground, the bones sometimes come through the skin, and have what we call compound fractures.\u201d\nTwo-thirds of E-scooter Injuries Are Incurred by Men and Boys\nIn 2024, just over two-thirds (67.70%) of e-scooter injuries were incurred by males. However, research has shown that while males are more likely to be involved in accidents \u2014in part because they take more e-scooter journeys \u2014 females who ride are 1.5 times more likely to be involved in an injury crash.\nNichole Morris, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s HumanFIRST Laboratory, says that this female susceptibility to e-scooter injuries \u201cmay suggest a need to examine potential e-scooter design issues that may not adapt well to female riders, such as handlebar height, center of gravity, and required upper body strength.\u201d\nOver 10,000 Annual E-scooter Injuries Involve Driving Under the Influence\nOf 115,713 e-scooter injuries in 2024, some 2,515 (2.17%) involved recreational drugs and 8,699 (7.52%) involved alcohol. Worryingly, a study from North Dakota State University found that, \u201cCompared with adults under age 40, children ages 10 to 17\u2026 had 7.5 times greater odds of these emergency department visits that involved drinking.\u201d\nOther research has shown that driving while intoxicated is disproportionately likely to result in a head injury; some 68% of alcohol-related e-scooter injuries result in head trauma, compared to 28% among non-alcohol-related injuries.\nRiding an e-scooter under the influence may land you with a DUI in most states, although some \u2014 such as Wisconsin \u2014 don\u2019t count an e-scooter as a vehicle for DUI purposes.\nSummer is Peak Season for E-scooter Injuries\nNext, we looked at the timing of e-scooter-related injuries. The danger peaks in the summer, with 14,424 injuries occurring in July 2024. The lowest figure was in January (3,950). However, it\u2019s worth noting that this was coming out of a year (2023-24) when injuries in general rose rapidly \u2014 we may well expect the January 2025 figure to be much higher. Indeed, December 2024 closed out at 6,266 injuries.\nFurthermore, research has shown that e-scooter riders experience a greater proportion (24.2%) of all e-scooter injuries during the winter months, compared to bicycle riders (20%).\nWeekends are the worst time of the week for e-scooter injuries. Some 18,851, or 16.29%, of all e-scooter injuries in 2024 occurred on a Saturday. Sunday (17,499 or 15.12%) was the second most likely day to get hurt.\nFridays and Tuesdays also stand out as high-impact days, although there is less than a 1.5% difference between the best and worst weekdays for injuries. In fact, U.S. e-scooter injuries are far more evenly spread throughout the week and weekend than elsewhere. At least two studies in separate German cities found that more than half of local e-scooter injuries occurred on weekends, with one study concluding that this pattern indicates the dangers of leisure-oriented use.\nNew Zealand Has Densest Cluster of E-Scooter Road Accidents\nFinally, we appraised the frequency of electric scooter-related road accidents per capita in every country.\nThe U.S. had the second most such accidents in 2025 (6,885), but such accidents are relatively infrequent compared to population size (20 e-scooter road accidents per million people). By comparison, Germany has only 8.9% more accidents in total but 350% more per capita (90 accidents per million people).\nWith 3,400 annual e-scooter road accidents among its population of 5.2 million people, New Zealand suffers the highest density of such events: 654 per million people. Unlike many other places in the world, in New Zealand it is permitted to ride an e-scooter on the road or on the sidewalk. Evidence is mounting that the prevalence of e-scooters on the streets discourages pedestrians from leaving their homes for fear of getting hurt, with advocacy group Blind Citizens NZ claiming that speed restrictions and other controls are not currently working.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that e-scooters are convenient, fun, and get you places faster,\u201d said engineering firm WSP\u2019s research manager, Louise Malcolm. \u201cBut they\u2019re also five times more likely than cycling to cause death or serious injury. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important we get the safety settings right.\u201d\nMicromobility Should Be Convenient, Not Casual\nThere is no doubt that shared and electric micromobility options like e-scooters can be convenient and fun, improving accessibility and potentially reducing some areas of ecological wear and tear (production and disposal footprints notwithstanding).\nHowever, as the technology has been rolled out \u2014 often in a landgrab scenario as brands tried to conquer the market \u2014 safety legislation and user sophistication have lagged behind.\nFor example, it is not currently the norm to wear a helmet or take training before riding an e-scooter. With a slower or more controlled introduction, these cultural patterns might have been shaped very differently. Research has found that although \u201creducing the collision speed from 25 km/h to 15 km/h can decrease the risk of head injuries to pedestrians by up to 49 percent,\u201d riders tend to default to the top available speed.\nAs such, when starting out with electric scooters, riders should follow these safety tips:\n- Always keep your eyes focused on the road ahead\n- Keep both hands on the handlebars\n- Use a proper helmet\n- Slow down before turning or looking back\n- Practice in a safe area first\n- Use both brakes, if you have them\n- Inspect your scooter regularly\n- Wear lights or hi-vis clothing\n- Use eye protection\n- Choose a reliable electric scooter\n- Know and follow your local laws\nThe streets are a communal space, and the way you ride influences both the safety of others and the example you set for new electric scooter riders.\nMethodology & Sources\nWe sourced electric scooter injury data from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission's NEISS Database, which collects data on consumer product-related injuries from a sample of over 100 ER departments in the U.S. The database provides weighting scores for each injury entry, enabling us to extrapolate the figures to represent estimates for the entire U.S. We sourced the global data on electric scooter road accidents manually from reputable news sources in each country.\nData is correct as of July 2025."
