      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Caroline Hill turned down multiple Division I women's track and field scholarships to compete for Division III Rochester Institute of Technology.\nHer talents allowed her to break the program record in the 200-meter and 300-meter early in her collegiate career. But then she had to watch both records fall to transgender teammate Sadie Schreiner, all while feeling \"uncomfortable\" sharing a locker room with her trans teammate for the next two years.\nThen, even after Schreiner was ruled ineligible to compete when the NCAA changed its transgender policy on Feb. 6, Hill alleges Schreiner continued to use the women's locker room and train with the team for another month. RIT has declined to comment on Hill's allegations.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nNow, Hill is the first of Schreiner's former RIT teammates to speak out about the experience. Hill previously joined Riley Gaines' lawsuit vs. the NCAA in early 2024 \u2013 Schreiner's first official year on her team (the 2023-24 season) \u2013 as an anonymous plaintiff. But now, Hill has come forward to put her name down publicly.\nHill claims she and her teammates were introduced to Schreiner as their future teammate in 2022. Schreiner did not officially begin to compete until 2023.\n\"He was practicing with us a little bit during the preseason,\" Hill said of the situation in 2022. Fox News Digital was unable to verify why Schreiner did not officially compete for RIT in 2022.\nWhen Schreiner began competing the following year, Hill claims the two of them were paired up as \"workout buddies\" by their coaches.\n\"We were sort of expected to be training buddies because we're both \u2018women\u2019 on the women's team running the same events,\" Hill said.\n\"Personally, I saw it as \u2018This is not fair. This is definitively unfair'\u2026 the expectation was that we are equals, being perceived as equals by the coach. That was what I had a harder time with.\"\nHill even made it a point to protest the situation to her coach and administrators, but to no avail. Hill even alleges that Jacqueline Nicholson, RIT executive director of intercollegiate athletics, told her and the other women on the team that Schreiner had \"less testosterone\" than some of them.\n\"I had a couple conversations with her. She was very firm in that \u2018This is what the NCAA is enforcing. We're supporting it,'\" Hill said. \"We even had a meeting with the women on the team where she addressed us and said, \u2018We support this athlete competing on the team. Some of you women have more testosterone than he does,\u2019 making it seem like it was totally fair and just as if we had a problem with it, that was not OK. It was very, very harsh.\"\nHill said her conversation with her sprint coach was futile as well.\n\"I was very vulnerable expressing my feelings about the male athlete competing and training with us. And he was not very empathetic,\" Hill said. \"He sort of tried to diminish my thoughts, and it was a lot of deflection. It's like, 'Well, we shouldn't be focusing on that.'\"\nHill also claims that other women on the team were supportive of competing with Schreiner.\n\"A lot of my teammates, um, were very supportive of this athlete competing and training with us,\" Hill said.\nIn Schreiner's second year on the team in 2024, the trans athlete broke Hill's program record in the 300-meter, clearing Hill's previous record, which she set her sophomore year in 2022, by 1.42 seconds.\nIn early 2025, Schreiner broke the program record in the 200-meter with a 24.46, besting Hill's best time of 25.82, which she set that same year. She ranks just behind Schreiner for second-best in program history.\nWhile Hill had to watch Schreiner break her collegiate records on the track, an even more personal dilemma awaited her in the locker room.\n\"I remember one day, I think I was changing, and all of a sudden this athlete is just in the locker room, and being very just shocked and kind of mortified obviously because it's uncomfortable to have a male in the locker room. And so actually his locker was right next to mine,\" Hill said. \"It's kind of a social area, but he really didn't talk to anyone.\"\nFORMER UPENN SWIMMER REFELCTS ON BEING TEAMMATES WITH LIA THOMAS\nHill also said Schreiner never changed in the women's locker room. Still, Hill said she actively tried to avoid changing in front of Schreiner, but that wasn't always an option.\n\"If he was like standing there doing something or whatever, I would kind of wait for him to be somewhere else before I changed,\" Hill said. \"Or there were times where I did, but I would just change as quickly as I could and, you know, I was able to just like suck it up, I guess. Not that I should have had to do that.\"\nHill spent the two years of her collegiate career sharing those spaces and competitions with Schreiner. After President Donald Trump signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order on Feb. 5, which aimed to put an end to situations like the one at RIT, the NCAA complied the next day, changing its policy to only allow biological females to compete as women.\nHill said the coaches never officially informed the female athletes that Schreiner wouldn't be competing with them anymore.\nRIT provided a statement to Fox News Digital on Feb. 12 that read, \"We continue to follow the NCAA participation policy for transgender student-athletes following the Trump administration\u2019s executive order. Sadie is not participating in the next meet.\"\nHowever, Hill alleged that this didn't mean the end of seeing Schreiner in the locker room or at practice.\n\"He was still changing with us and all that. I was sort of confused,\" Hill said. \"Utilizing our coaches, our facilities, our resources during a practice times even though the rules had been changed. So it didn't end with the rule change. He kept training with us. Not that we were training buddies, but he was always there at the same time as I was\u2026 I would say a month after [the rule change].\"\nSchreiner's attorney, Susie Cirilli of Cirilli LLC, told Fox News Digital, \"We are not responding at this time,\" in response to a request for comment on Hill's statements.\nEventually, Schreiner made an effort to compete in non-NCAA sanctioned events.\nSchreiner competed at the USA Track & Field Open Masters Championships on March 1 in New York.\nThere, Schreiner took first place in the women's 400-meter dash and 200-meter dash.\nFORMER SJSU STAR MAKES NEW ALLEGATIONS ABOUT PROBE INTO TRANS TEAMMATE'S ALLEGED PLOT TO HARM HER\nWeeks after that, Schreiner posted an Instagram video claiming to have likely competed in Schreiner's last organized track meet in the U.S. after a USATF event in Maine.\n\"I very likely just ran what will be my last meet in the United States,\" Schreiner said, later adding, \"I will find a way to keep competing, but I doubt that will be in the United States.\"\nSchreiner said USATF changed its policy on transgender eligibility from the one used by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which allows biological males to compete in the women's category, to the one used by World Athletics, which bans any athlete who has undergone male puberty from competing as a woman. The USATF's official transgender eligibility policy does now reference the World Athletics guidelines on its official webpage. It previously referenced the IOC's policy, as seen in an archive via Wayback Machine.\nThen in July, Schreiner filed a lawsuit against Princeton University after the school allegedly excluded the athlete from a May 3 women's race.\nSchreiner's lawsuit claimed the athlete attempted to participate in the women's 200-meter sprint at the Larry Ellis Invitational as one of the 141 participants unattached to a university or club. The suit alleges officials told Schreiner the athlete could not participate 15 minutes before the race began.\n\"The actions of the two Princeton officials were in blatant and willful disregard of Sadie\u2019s rights based on Sadie\u2019s rights as a transgender woman under controlling New Jersey law, thereby causing Sadie Schreiner to foreseeable emotional and physical harm,\" the lawsuit argued.\nCirilli provided an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital about Schreiner's lawsuit against Princeton.\n\"The action of the two Princeton officials were in blatant and willful disregard of Sadie\u2019s rights as a transgender woman under controlling New Jersey Law,\" the statement read. \"The actions of the defendants were utterly intolerable in a civilized community and go beyond the possible bounds of decency.\"\nMeanwhile, Hill, having graduated from RIT with a degree in graphic design, is pressing ahead as a now-public member of the Gaines vs. NCAA lawsuit.\nHill said fear of retaliation from fellow students at the school and elsewhere prevented her from speaking out against the situation earlier. But now, as the culture in America has shifted, Hill is proudly putting her name out there as an advocate to protect women's sports.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I was definitely a little worried being on campus, being on my team, um, with administration that felt strongly, I get that they were against the lawsuit\u2026 I was a little worried about my own safety and that things might escalate in a way that I couldn't foresee,\" Hill said.\n\"I feel like it's worthwhile to come forward [now] just because I have the ability to use what has happened to me as a way to show that harm is being done to women, to female athletes\u2026 it is scary to put yourself out there because I'm sure there's a lot of girls out there that feel like they can't and don't have a voice.\n\"The NCAA has definitely made it so that they, a lot of women and girls don't feel like they can speak out, so I want to do it.\"\nHill is calling for RIT to apologize to her and reinstate her as the program record-holder for the 200- and 300-meter.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

      "text": "A lawsuit from a Bucks County student who claims she was forced to compete with a trans athlete was dismissed by a federal judge.\nThe case, which was dismissed on August 1, 2025, discusses how the plaintiff, Aislin Magalengo, first encountered Luce Allen, a trans student at Plymouth Whitemarsh High School (PWMHS), at a cross-country meet. The lawsuit says that on September 11, 2024, Magalengo was competing against Allen at a cross-country meet at Quakertown Community High School (QCHS) in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. Allen won first place at the meet, while Magalengo won second.\nStream Philadelphia News for free, 24/7, wherever you are with NBC10.\nAccording to the lawsuit, after the race, Magalengo told Allen, \u201cYou are not a girl. You should not be racing against girls.\u201d\nMagalengo\u2019s parents reached out to QCHS to see if they could prevent trans people from competing in sports, but the school responded by saying they had no control over whether or not Allen could compete, since she went to a different school and school district. Magalengo continued to compete alongside Allen in future cross-country meets during the season.\nGet top local Philly stories delivered to you every morning with NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\u201cHer Amended Complaint is devoid of any factual allegations that she was subject to purposeful discrimination, other than asserting as much in the most conclusory fashion,\u201d wrote Judge Wendy Beetlestone in her decision. \u201cShe points to no instances of students assigned female at birth being treated differently than those assigned male at birth, and, as such, she has failed to plausibly state a claim for sex-based discrimination.\u201d\nMagalengo had attempted to sue the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA), the Quakertown Community School District and the Colonial School District. The PIAA and Quakertown Community School District could not be reached for comment. The Colonial School District did not comment on the case.\n\u201cEducation Law Center Pennsylvania is very pleased to see this thoughtful, well-reasoned opinion from the district court that rejected all the cisgender student athlete\u2019s claims as insufficient under law to prove she was discriminated against and \u2018forced\u2019 to participate against a trans athlete,\u201d Katrina Moon, a senior attorney at Education Law Center Pennsylvania who provided legal support to Allen, wrote in a statement.\nLocal\nBreaking news and the stories that matter to your neighborhood.\nIn Judge Beetlestone\u2019s decision, she references Doe v. Boyertown, a 2018 Third Circuit case, and says that the issues in this lawsuit have already been determined by this case. Doe v. Boyertown focused on trans people in women\u2019s spaces at schools, and concluded that trans people should not be excluded from those spaces.\n\u201cThe client\u2019s disappointed, obviously, and still believes strongly in what\u2019s happened,\u201d said Keith Altman, the lawyer who represented Magalengo. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue pursuing the issue. We think it\u2019s an extremely important issue, and it\u2019s got to be resolved.\u201d\nAltman says that he and his client are planning to appeal the case in the coming weeks.\n\u201cIt is irrefutable that males, as a general proposition, are more physically capable than females. We think that it is fundamentally unfair that somebody that simply says, \u2018Well, I identify as a female\u2019 is now able to compete with females and dominate women\u2019s athletics. It just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Altman said.\nThe Trump Administration has recently targeted trans athletes with multiple new policies, including most recently banning them from \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d visas. This case is one of many that demonstrates how public and political opinions are shifting regarding trans people and trans issues.\n\u201cAcross Pennsylvania and the country transgender and other LGBTQ+ students are afraid to be themselves in school because of these discriminatory views and policies,\" wrote Moon. \"If students are worried about their right to exist and be treated fairly, they can\u2019t focus on school and enjoy club or sports activities.\""

      "text": "The 2024-25 school year in the U.S. was beset by a series of controversies involving trans athletes playing for girls' sports teams.\nMany of these incidents have garnered national attention and ignited heated debates.\nPresident Donald Trump took aim at this issue on Feb. 5 when he signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order, but multiple Democrat-controlled states defied it.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nAs the school year and spring sports season come to a close, here is a breakdown of all the incidents that shook the nation over the last year.\nCalifornia\nCalifornia was the nation's biggest hotbed of incidents involving trans athletes in girls' sports.\nTransgender athlete AB Hernandez of Jurupa Valley High School won the girls' triple jump and high jump state championships this past weekend against the backdrop of local protests and national attention after Trump called out the situation earlier last week. California's high school sports league responded by amending its rules to accommodate female athletes who finished behind a trans athlete in the three events Hernandez competed in, granting them qualification and podium finishes they would have earned had a biologically male athlete not competed in those events.\nThis resulted in Hernandez having to share podium spots with the female athletes who finished one spot behind Hernandez after the finals on Saturday.\nMeanwhile, the protests at the meet escalated into a violent crime scene after a pro-LGBTQ protester was arrested for allegedly assaulting a conservative with a transgender pride flag, women's rights activist Sophia Lorey was police escorted out of the venue for handing out \"Save Girls Sports\" wristbands, and a plane flew over head with a banner that read \"No Boys in Girls' Sports!\"\nHowever, months before Hernandez took the titles at the chaotic track meet, a girls' cross-country controversy at Martin Luther King High School resulted in a lawsuit and student uprising.\nStudents Kaitlyn Slavin and Taylor Starling filed the lawsuit against the Riverside Unified School District after a trans athlete took Starling's varsity spot on the girls' cross-country team, and alleged the school administrators compared \"Save Girls Sports\" T-shirts the girls wore in protest to swastikas.\nThen hundreds of students at the school began to wear the shirts every Wednesday despite the school putting a dress code in place to forbid it. The school began putting the students wearing them in detention, but that did not stop the teens from wearing them. Eventually, the school stopped punishing students for wearing the shirts, and they continued to wear them every week.\nIn the fall and winter sports seasons, a transgender athlete for San Francisco Waldorf ignited national controversy for the school's girls' volleyball and basketball teams.\nDuring the girls' volleyball season, Stone Ridge Christian's team forfeited a playoff game to Waldorf. The Stone Ridge Christian girls sacrificed their season to take a public stand by refusing to face the trans athlete and were later honored by activist Riley Gaines.\nThen in February, the trans athlete was set to face Cornerstone Christian in a girls' basketball playoff game, just weeks after Trump signed his executive order. That time, it was San Francisco Waldorf's player who refused to play, skipping the game amid warnings by the U.S. Department of Education, which Fox News Digital first reported. With the trans athlete out of the lineup, San Francisco Waldorf lost the playoff game by 26 points.\nAnother California transgender high school volleyball player was booed and harassed at an Oct. 12 match between Notre Dame Belmont and Half Moon Bay High School, according to ABC 7. Half Moon Bay rostered the transgender athlete.\nDuring the Lucia Mar Unified School District board meeting in April, a high-school junior girls' track athlete at Arroyo Grande High School named Celeste Diest took the lectern to recount her experience of having to change in front of a biologically male trans athlete before practice, while that athlete allegedly watched her undress. The school board president told Diest to \"wrap it up\" while the teen cried.\nThen, at the following meeting, a girl named Audrey Vanherweg said she had to change in her car to avoid changing with the trans athlete. At the very same meeting, a trans athlete at the school also spoke.\n\"When I joined track last year, I was terrified,\" the athlete said. \"I was alone, and I feared for my life. When I started going to track practice, I was too afraid to make friends. I thought they would reject and mock me for being transgender. At my first meet, I sat alone, on the wet, muddy ground.\n\"I fear that somebody would accuse me of a heinous crime, so I walked on razor-thin ice. I never spent longer than three minutes in the locker room. I never made eye contact with people,\" the athlete said. \"And yet, people still accuse me, someone who deals with sexual harassment on a daily basis, of being a predator. So, I'm here to say that I am not the villain, I am the victim.\"\nMaine\nMaine became ground zero for Trump's campaign to force Democrat leaders to comply with his executive order in February after a spat between him and Gov. Janet Mills during a bi-partisan meeting of governors at the White House.\nThe spat occurred days after a transgender athlete for Greely High School won a girls' pole vault state title. Greely's athlete had previously competed in boys' track and field two years earlier.\n\"I watched this male pole vaulter stand on the podium, and we were all just like looking we were like \u2018We\u2019re pretty sure that's not a girl. There's no way that's a girl,'\" Presque Isle student Hailey Himes previously told Fox News Digital. \"It was really discouraging, especially for the girls on the podium not in first place. So that motivated me to fight for them.\"\nMeanwhile, another trans athlete in the state for North Yarmouth Academy has beaten multiple girls' athletes in cross-country, track and field and Nordic Skiing.\nMaine girls' athlete Cassidy Carlisle of Presque Isle High School lost big competitions to North Yarmouth's trans athlete in both cross-country and Nordic skiing.\n\"The defeat that comes with that in that moment is heartbreaking,\" Carlisle said. \"I'm just in shock in a way. I didn't believe it. \u2026 I didn't think it was happening to me.\"\nNow, both Greely's and North Yarmouth's trans athletes are set to compete in the upcoming girls' track and field state finals this weekend.\nMinnesota\nMinnesota's girls' softball season is currently at the center of national attention as a transgender pitcher is leading Champlin Park High School on a dominant postseason run.\nThe pitcher led Champlin Park to the state tournament with a dominant shutout victory in the sectional final on Thursday, and now the school will compete in the state tournament for the first time in program history on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit by three anonymous female players has been filed against the state for allowing the player to compete.\nThe law firm representing the plaintiffs, Alliance Defending Freedom, provided statements from one of the female players about her experience facing the trans athlete.\n\"Hitting against him is not only a physical challenge but a mental, too. It\u2019s a mental battle knowing that he has an advantage in the sport that I grew up playing, making it hard to even want to hit against him. His ability to get outs and spin the ball is a strong advantage, but like I said it\u2019s also incredibly mentally challenging knowing that you\u2019re competing against someone who has unfair advantages leaving you with little to no confidence,\" the player said.\n\"This issue has affected me in ways that I never imagined. It\u2019s simply unfair, and I hate that nothing is happening to change that. Boys should not be able to take girls' spots on teams just because they are capable of doing so. I hope that more girls affected by this issue will stand up against this.\"\nOregon\nOregon was thrust into the national spotlight over the issue this past weekend at the state track and field championships when two female athletes went viral for refusing to take the podium next to a trans athlete after medaling in the girls' high jump.\nThe two high school seniors, Reese Eckard of Sherwood High School and Alexa Anderson of Tigard High School, stepped down from their respective spots on the podium next to a trans athlete who represented Ida B. Wells High School.\nEckard, in fourth place, and Anderson, in third, each finished ahead of the trans athlete, who tied for fifth place. However, the two females faced the opposite direction as the other competitors received their medals from officials.\nAnderson alleges the official ordered her and Eckard to get out of the shot of photos if they were not going to stand on the podium.\n\"We stepped off the podium in protest and, as you can see, the official kind of told us 'hey, go over there, if you\u2019re not going to participate, get out of the photos,'\" Anderson alleged during an interview on Fox News Channel's \"The Ingraham Angle\" Monday night.\n\"They asked us to move away from the medal stand, so when they took the photos, we weren't even in it at all.\"\nIn early April, the Ida B. Wells trans athlete finished first place in a varsity high jump competition roughly two years after finishing last while competing against junior varsity boys.\nBack in March, a trans athlete for McDaniel High School finished in first place in the 200M and 400M races during the 6A-1 Portland Interscholastic League Championship in 2024, breaking season records.\nHOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE\nNew Hampshire\nDespite having a law in place to restrict biological males in girls' sports, three trans athletes found their way onto girls' sports teams in New Hampshire over the last year.\nPlymouth Regional High School's Parker Tirrell competed on the girls' tennis team, Pembroke Academy's Iris Turmelle competed on that school's girls' soccer team, as their families have filed a lawsuit to enable the trans athletes' respective inclusion on each team. After Trump's executive order, they expanded the lawsuit to include his administration as well.\nIn September, parents wore pink \"XX\" wristbands during a high school soccer game that Tirrell played in to show support to the female athletes involved. The protest led to Bow and Dunbarton School Districts Superintendent Marcy Kelley issuing a notice of trespass against parents Anthony and Nicole Foote, along with Kyle Fellers and Eldon Rash, according to the New Hampshire Journal.\nThe parents then sued the school district, claiming their First Amendment rights were violated. However, in mid-April, U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe ruled that the district acted reasonably in its decision to prevent parents from wearing the wristbands.\nMeanwhile, Bishop Brady High School saw its girls' soccer team boycott a game against Kearsage Regional High School over a trans athlete on that team in October.\nThe judge who made the ruling to overrule the state's laws preventing trans inclusion in girls' sports was Landya McCafferty, who is a liberal appointed to her seat by former President Barack Obama in 2013.\nWashington\nIn February, a civil rights complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights on behalf of a teenage girl in Washington state who was allegedly punished for refusing to play a basketball game against a trans athlete.\nThe complaint alleged that the Tumwater School District in Washington investigated 15-year-old Frances Staudt for \"misgendering\" the opponent and violating the district's policies against bullying and harassment on Feb. 7.\nStaudt appeared on the YouTube series \"[un]Divided with Brandie Kruse\" with her mother to discuss the situation later that month.\n\"I've had threats at me. I've had people telling me I'm going to hell. I've had people saying, \u2018Good luck having any future after this\u2019 and saying, \u2018I know all the people who are reporting your account are happy to see your downfall, and know that it\u2019s going to be a real rough time for you in your future because of your decision to post this,'\" Staudt said\nJust days later, the trans athlete involved in the incident, identified as Andi Rooks, appeared on the same show alongside the athlete's father.\n\"I've never had an issue until this game, and my goal was never to make anybody uncomfortable in any way, and I didn't even realize Frances had an issue until I got yelled at at the game,\" Rooks said. \"If she had had a conversation with me before the game, I would have sat out. My last thing I want to do is make anybody uncomfortable.\"\nRooks added that the athlete will sit out any future games if opponents are uncomfortable facing a trans athlete.\n\"If any other person or player I'm playing against is like, \u2018I don\u2019t feel comfortable with this,' I don't mind sitting out,\" Rooks said.\nThe Tumwater School District went on to pass its own rule to ban trans athletes from girls' sports, before a Department of Education investigation was launched against the district for the incident.\nThen this past weekend, Ver\u00f3nica Garcia, a transgender competitor, has been on top of the competition in the girls\u2019 400-meter races during the Washington state outdoor season in 2025 and finished in first place during the state championships on Saturday.\nGarcia, who competes for East Valley High School in Spokane, took home the title in the 2A race for the second straight year. Garcia finished first in the 2A Greater Spokane League District Championship on May 23 and won several other regular-season races over the course of the year.\nGarcia told The Seattle Times there were boos from the crowd that did not agree that biological males should compete against girls in sports. However, Garcia fired back with a defiant message after the race was over.\n\"I\u2019ll be honest, I kind of expect it,\" Garcia told the outlet. \"But it maybe didn\u2019t have their intended effect. It made me angry, but not angry as in, I wanted to give up, but angry as in, I\u2019m going to push.\n\"I\u2019m going to put this in the most PG-13 way. I\u2019m just going to say it\u2019s a damn shame they don\u2019t have anything else better to do. I hope they get a life. But oh well. It just shows who they are as people.\"\nPennsylvania\nIn May, Plymouth Whitemarsh High School trans athlete Luce Allen took first place in the Liberty Girls' 200-meter race at the SOL American Conference Championships. Allen barely defeated the second-place runner by fewer than two-hundredths of a second.\nAllen's parents had previously said that it would be \"cruel\" to \"force\" the male athlete to compete against boys and that Allen should be allowed to race against girls because that is how the athlete \"identifies.\"\n\"My child is a female in her heart and soul, and according to her medical labs. Having her play sports with males would be cruel,\" Allen's mother, Sarah Hansen said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Through an attorney, Allen released a statement that said, in part, \"If you remove the ability of trans people to compete with a team that corresponds with their gender, then you\u2019ll strip them of their opportunity to develop as people.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNew York\nIn April, a trans athlete joined the girls' varsity track team William Floyd High School despite not being on hormone replacement treatment, according to The New York Post.\nA group of female student athletes told the South Shore Press they would feel uncomfortable if they had to share a locker room with a biologically male competitor.\nWest Virginia\nBecky Pepper-Jackson, a 13-year-old freshman at Bridgeport Senior High School who has been the subject of a Supreme Court case about their participation in girls\u2019 sports, finished in third place in the discus event and eighth in the shot put competition at the West Virginia state championship in late May.\nA federal appeals court blocked a West Virginia law that would have kept biological males from competing against girls and women in sports last year. The court said the law cannot lawfully be applied to a middle school-aged trans girl who has been taking puberty-blocking medication and has publicly identified as a girl since the third grade.\nWest Virginia has since made an appeal to the Supreme Court regarding the appeals court\u2019s ruling.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

      "text": "Former University of Pennsylvania swimmer Monika Burzynska said she was assigned the locker just one over from Lia Thomas' when the transgender athlete joined the women's swim team in 2021. Burzynska previously knew the athlete as Will Thomas, a member of the men's swimming team at UPenn.\n\"He wasn't very social,\" Burzynska told Fox News Digital, adding she had only ever had short, passing conversations with Thomas.\nShe thought Thomas had already graduated when her team was dealt the news that the athlete would be transitioning to join the women's team starting in the 2021-22 season.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nWhen that season eventually began, and Thomas became a fixture in the women's locker room, Burzynska often retreated to the corner of the room to change. Other times, Burzynska timed exactly when she changed to coincide with when Thomas showered. Eventually, Burzynska opted to only change in the stalls or in the family locker across the hall.\n\"Around Lia, I wasn't going to risk anything,\" Burzynska said, regarding the possibility of the trans athlete seeing her undress.\nBurzynska has never spoken out about her experience of being on a team with Thomas until now, amid the recent news that UPenn agreed to apologize to all the female swimmers, rescind Thomas' program records, and adopt a new policy that applies strict biological definitions for males and females.\nShe said the news gave her \"a deep sense of peace and validation.\"\n\"Not only for me, but for all the girls on the team, for all the girls in the swim world and in the sport world. And I think this decision, it brought back \u2013 at least for me \u2013 a sense of fairness that had been lost,\" Burzynska said. \"Women's records belong to women and that protecting the integrity of women's sports still matters.\"\nStill, the memories of what Burzynska and others had to endure lingers.\nBurzynska identifies as someone with conservative values, but says she grew up feeling \"compassion\" for transgender people. Her views changed when she was placed next to Thomas in the locker room.\n\"I thought it must be terrible to feel like you're trapped in the wrong body. Just be so out of touch with who you really are,\" Burzynska said. \"You have these issues that are from afar and you never really quite think they're going to touch you personally until you're on a team with Lia Thomas and your locker is directly next to this biological male. And you would have never believed that you'd be facing this issue directly.\n\"And then when that happens, your views change where you still feel sorry for this person because they're clearly so deeply lost. But then it turns into more, \u2018OK, this is not fair,\u2019\" Burzynska added.\nAs a native of Colonia, New Jersey, Burzynska explained that she grew up in a liberal environment with prominent pro-LGBTQ sentiment. Those values followed her when she went to UPenn in the deep blue city of Philadelphia.\n\"We have a very, very, how should I call it, like deep LGBTQ presence on campus where the campus buildings or the dormitories, rather than flying the U.S. flag, the trans flag, the LGBTQ flag [were flown]. Whenever I visit Penn, I see it's like this huge skyscraper dorm, and they have the biggest rainbow flag you could imagine,\" Burzynska said.\n\"So I guess, in a sense, you could say it encourages it if a person is very confused about their identity, and then there's this group that seems so accepting, so loving, telling you could be whatever you want to be\u2026 that might kind of, yeah, encourage people to turn that way.\"\nBurzynska, and the other female swimmers on the team at the time, were allegedly coerced into silence and submission by UPenn administrators.\nA lawsuit by three other former Thomas teammates, Grace, Estabrook, Margot Kaczorowski and Ellen Holmquist, alleged that university officials pressured them not to speak out about their thoughts on Thomas joining the team publicly.\n\"The UPenn administrators went on to tell the women that if the women spoke publicly about their concerns about Thomas\u2019 participation on the Women\u2019s Team, the reputation of those complaining about Thomas being on the team would be tainted with transphobia for the rest of their lives and they would probably never be able to get a job,\u2019\" the lawsuit alleged.\nUPENN AGREES TO FOLLOW TRUMP'S MANDATE ON PROTECTING WOMEN'S SPORTS AFTER LIA THOMAS INVESTIGATION\nBurzynska, having grown up in a liberal New Jersey town, was already accustomed to the consequences of sharing conservative values in a liberal setting.\nBurzynska recalls, from a young age, often being criticized for having \"conservative or Republican values.\"\n\"I had been experiencing that forever. And even UPenn, I think it's every university at this point, but UPenn is very, very left-leaning. And so I was kind of ready to embrace that, that my views wouldn't be welcomed because, yeah, I've been conservative most of my life. My beliefs are grounded in faith.\"\nBurzynska recalls a futile conversation she had with her head coach, Mike Schnur, when she confronted him with concerns about being on a team with Thomas.\n\"We had this long meeting, I don't know, almost two hours long. And he said, 'Listen, Monika, I understand all your concerns. They're all valid. I don't think any of them would deter you from continuing onto your senior year and having a successful senior year. I think the one thing that would deter you is that Lia is changing in your locker room and there's nothing you could do about it,'\" Burzynska said.\n\"I told him in that meeting, \u2018What are you talking about? Like, how is this fair?\u2019 And his response was, 'It's not fair, but if you have any issues with it, come to me\u2026 Don't talk about it with everyone else. Come to me. We'll talk through it'\"\nBurzynska said she never took Schnur up on that offer, believing that he wouldn't do anything about it anyway.\nStill, she alleges she witnessed her teammates having those futile conversations with Schnur, from a distance.\nThen came the administrators that allegedly pressured the women's swimmers who objected to Thomas to go to pro-LGBTQ counseling. Burzynska said she called the counseling session \"brainwashing meetings.\"\nShe never attended the sessions.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBurzynska has since moved on from the situation and has embraced her life and career beyond it.\nStill, she admits that parts of the situation instilled \"trauma\" in her, and she is grateful that President Donald Trump's administration made it a priority to instill consequences on UPenn.\n\"Those [women's] rights at Penn were clearly compromised so it's amazing that they looked into it and Trump took it so seriously,\" Burzynska said.\nFox News Digital has reached out to UPenn for a response to Burzynska's statements.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

The judge ruled that Magalengo's complaint lacked factual allegations of discrimination, stating she failed to demonstrate that she was treated differently than other female athletes. Magalengo's attorney announced plans to appeal the decision, arguing that allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports is fundamentally unfair.",
