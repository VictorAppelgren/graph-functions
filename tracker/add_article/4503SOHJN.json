      "summary": "Corey Lewandowski, a special employee of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has reportedly exceeded the 130-day limit for his position, leading to speculation about his status and alleged use of colleagues' badges. Noem and Lewandowski, both married, have faced allegations of an extramarital affair, which they deny, despite being seen together in compromising situations at public events. Meanwhile, Noem has been actively involved in deportation raids, emphasizing a crackdown on illegal immigration under the Trump administration, which has seen a significant drop in border crossings.",
