  "title": "Google Maps' Secret Upgrade on Android 16 Could Change How You Navigate Forever",
  "description": "Google Maps is quietly testing Live Updates on Android 16, bringing real-time progress notifications to your lock screen, AOD, and status bar.",
  "content": "Google wants to improve real-time monitoring on Android 16 by adding Live Updates to Google Maps. The feature, initially introduced in the latest Android ecosystem, enables users to keep track of food deliveries, flights, rides, and now navigation.\n\nAlthough support has been limited to date, the tech giant is now rolling out the feature to one of its most popular apps.\n\nWhat Are Live Updates on Android 16?\n\nLive Updates provide users with real-time, progress-based notifications that appear on the lock screen, status bar, and Always-On Display (AOD). Rather than flipping between apps, users can easily monitor in-progress activity such as deliveries or directions without interruption.\n\nAccording to Android Authority, this feature is currently only partially deployed, with more comprehensive support to come in Android 16's Quarterly Platform Release (QPR2). The update will introduce additional system-level functionality, such as status bar chips and richer AOD integration.\n\nPixel and Samsung user reports of running Android 16 QPR2 beta confirm that Google Maps is experimenting with the integration of Live Updates.\n\nThe new Maps notification has a progress-oriented design, indicating how far you've progressed in your journey. Unlike regular notifications, these updates are seen across multiple surfaces, so users don't miss essential navigation information.\n\nThe rollout is presently narrow and does not reach all devices. That said, participants in the Google Maps beta program could have an opportunity to try out the feature ahead of the general public, subject to availability.\n\nWhen Wider Availability Can Be Expected?\n\nGoogle most recently tested this feature in March 2025, and now it seems near a formal release. Industry analysts anticipate Google Maps Live Updates to debut with the rollout of Android 16 QPR1, potentially releasing this week or the next, Police.\n\nWhen QPR2 is out, additional third-party apps are likely to take up Live Updates, pushing the feature beyond Maps. Of course, this would be a game-changer for ride-hailing apps and order tracking platforms. That's a different story for music apps.\n\nIt's a Huge Help For Navigation\n\nFrom the outside, the upgrade can appear minimalistic, but it thoroughly enhances navigation ease. With AOD and lock screen progress-based updates, drivers and commuters can quickly take a look at their devices for real-time travel updates without having to unlock or change apps.\n\nLast month, Google Maps brought the \"Your Recent Places\" section, so you don't have to do additional steps just to locate your visit history. That's a good update, especially if you want to keep track of the spots you want to visit within an area.",

      "text": "Android 16 introduced support for Live Updates, making it easier to track real-time notifications from food delivery apps, flight trackers, etc. The feature is only partially implemented in the current Android 16 build, with the first QPR release slated to add support for status bar chips and Always-On Display. App support is also sparse, with most of Google's apps also not working with Live Updates yet. That may soon change, as Google has been spotted testing Live Updates integration for Google Maps.\nSeveral Pixel and Samsung users report seeing the Google Maps Live Updates notification on their phones running Android 16 QPR2 beta (via Android Authority). As part of the change, the new Maps notification features a progress-centric style, indicating how far you've progressed in your journey. It also appears on the Always-On Display screen, status bar, and the lock screen, taking priority over other notifications.\nWhile the improvement may not seem like a big deal, it would make following navigation directions much easier.\nLive Updates in Google Maps will only appear if your phone runs Android 16 QPR2. Even then, the rollout is limited, as Google isn\u2019t widely testing the feature yet. The company was last spotted working on integrating Live Updates in Google Maps on Android 16 back in March this year.\nGoogle will likely roll out this Google Maps improvement alongside the release of Android 16 QPR1. Thankfully, we won't have to wait long, as the first Quarterly Platform Release of Android 16 is expected to arrive this week or early next week. You can join the Google Maps beta program \u2014 provided slots are available \u2014 to try your luck and get early access to Live Updates when Google starts wider testing.\nLive Updates adoption should pick up soon\nOnce Android 16 QPR2 arrives, more third-party apps should add Live Updates support. It's one of the standout features of Android 16 and should make tracking real-time, priority notifications much easier.\nBesides navigation, Live Updates in Android 16 will work with food delivery, ride-sharing, and order tracking apps. It won't work with music apps, as they cannot use the new progress-style notification template. Instead, they must use the Media-style template to gain elevated privileges to the Quick Settings panel, lock screen, and AOD."

      "text": "Google has released a new feature for maps that allows the app to save screenshots made by the user while looking for places or destinations.\nThis new feature is called \"Screenshot to Save,\" and its main goal is to transform those screenshots into useful data that users may compile right on the Google Maps app without the need for extra steps.\nGoogle Maps Transforms Screenshots to Saved Locations\nAccording to the latest GIF post of Google Maps on the X app, the navigation platform is getting a new feature that will help in saving locations of places you search for after taking a screenshot. Instead of only getting the photo of the place or area a user screenshots, Google will go the extra mile by taking into account these specific places.\nIt was revealed by the company that its Gemini AI model powers this latest feature on Maps, and it goes alongside the latest generative AI feature that allows users to \"Ask About Place.\"\nAs revealed by the company, users may take screenshots of any place they prefer to visit, which Google Maps' Gemini could analyze and suggest saving in a list.\nRead Also: Google Maps Is Adding Gemini AI That Can Now Answer Your Location Queries: What's 'Ask About Place'?\nSimplify Your Travel Plans with Google Maps' New Feature\nHowever, while the company did not note which screenshots from platforms are eligible, it showed that it could recognize a location from the likes of YouTube.\nWith this feature, users may simplify their travel plans when coming across a post from social media or the internet by taking a screenshot as Google will automatically recognize a location and search its address automatically for users to save.\nCurrently, the feature is rolling out to Google Maps' iOS version in the US and Canada. Availability for Android and other regions will be announced soon.\nGoogle Maps Features: Top Travel App For You?\nGoogle has built its Maps app to be one of the top general navigation apps in the world for different kinds of travel, including car rides, walking, cycling, and the use of public transportation. It is also an excellent platform for private car rides, including going on a road trip with friends in separate cars, with its Group Navigation feature offering a connected experience for all.\nLast year's massive update brought new features that focus on a safer and smoother driving experience for car infotainment systems and smartphones, particularly for the Apple CarPlay. This update was made available to both Google Maps and Waze, with users given the chance to be collaborative and easily share hazards, traffic, accidents, and more information on the road in real-time.\nRecently, Google has integrated more of its Gemini AI to the platform, which made it easier for users to navigate using the Maps app. Gemini AI helps answer questions and provide context behind a location.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "Google has finally spoken up to clarify that Gmail's alleged major security issues, which have been reported about lately, are \"entirely false,\" claiming that the online e-mailing service is running without any problems.\nIn these past few days, Google has been hit with reports claiming that there are current major security issues present on Gmail's services, which affect a large number of global users.\nIn the recent clarification by the Mountain View-based tech giant, it has done its due diligence to check up on the alleged security issues, only to find nothing concerning it.\nGoogle Debunks Gmail's Major Security Issues Claims\nGmail remains to be one of the largest emailing services in the world, and according to Engadget, Google has received several reports about alleged major security issues found within its platform.\nHowever, the company is now speaking up against it, debunking claims of major security issues in its platform and calling them \"entirely false.\" The company said that there were no issues present whatsoever.\nAccording to Google, there are no major security issues, but there are always phishing threats present on the platform, which they are actively trying to fight against.\nThe company claimed that they take security seriously and that all conversations and information regarding it are \"accurate and factual,\" with significant investments and developments in place to improve safety on Gmail.\nThe company is now throwing shade against the many reports about the major security issues present on Gmail, saying that the company issued an \"emergency warning\" to all 2.5 billion users worldwide about a phishing attack.\nHowever, it was revealed by Forbes' report that Google first acknowledged this issue way back in June and has finished notifying affected users in early August.\nGoogle's Previous Gmail Issues\nGoogle is one to acknowledge security issues reported to them by researchers or white hat hackers, which either independently test their systems or collaborate with them to check on the platform. One of the biggest announcements it made was back in 2023, when almost 1.8 billion Gmail users were found to be potentially compromised with a critical flaw in its newly placed security feature.\nEarlier this year, a massive threat presented itself on the email platform as AI phishing scams grew significantly, with many using the service potentially vulnerable to the attacks. Because of the severity of the attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped up and took action against them by issuing warnings and listing ways to avoid falling for the scams.\nMoreover, Google has previously issued a notice to users claiming that they should not ignore or downplay \"Suspicious Login\" alerts from the Gmail app as these are most likely users trying to open their accounts.\nUsers should not exactly trust the location tags shared by the alert as the hacker or threat actor could be using a VPN, and users should focus on the IP addresses identified by the company.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "Google Maps has always been more than just a navigation tool. In fact, it's a daily companion for finding routes, exploring new spots, and keeping track of where you've been. However, locating your visit history hasn't always been straightforward.\nThat's about to change with Google's latest update, which introduces a new way to view your recent trips directly from the Maps app.\nGoogle Maps Adds 'Your Recent Places' Section\nThe latest Google Maps update (v25.34.00.796159725) introduces a feature named \"Your recent places.\" Android Authority first noticed this section showing up above \"Your lists\" in the You tab. It is acting as an all-in-one hub for all the places you've been to recently.\nWith this enhancement, it is that much simpler to backtrack your route or visit your favorite places without having to dig into settings.\nFilters for Smarter Navigation\nTo make the user experience even more intuitive, Google has added a filter carousel with four principal options: Area, Category, Saved, and Maps history. They enable you to narrow your search within seconds.\nFor instance, clicking Category opens into sub-filters of Food & Drink, Culture, Shopping, Attractions, and Hotels. That makes it easy to find a restaurant that you just visited or the museum you visited over the weekend quickly.\nNew Features for Saving and Sharing Places\nEvery entry in \"Your recent places\" includes a bookmark icon and a three-dot menu for extra functionality. According to Android Police, this bookmark enables you to save a place straight into your lists for convenient retrieval later.\nWhile the three-dot menu provides additional features like sharing with friends, viewing more information, or deleting it from your history if you don't want others to know you went there.\nTimeline vs. Recent Places: What's New?\nGoogle Maps already had a Timeline feature, which showed a history of your visited locations when location tracking is enabled. However, that timeline is tucked deeper inside the app, making it less convenient for quick access. The new \"Your recent places\" section brings that same information upfront, making it easier to check your activity without scrolling through menus.\nRegarding its availability, Google has not yet announced any update when it will be rolled out to everyone.\nBack in May, Google Maps unveiled a screenshot scanner that allows you to track places you've seen online based on your saved photos.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Preparedness is the key, and Google Maps is now a strong ally to aid in times of crisis.\nWith new features, this navigation tool facilitates the easy identification of emergency shelters, store inventory checking, and the availability of basic commodities such as ice. Here's how to check for available ice stores during the hurricane season.\nHow to Use Google Maps to Locate Shops That Sell Ice\nGoogle Maps' \"Products Nearby\" feature makes it possible for users to search for products, like ice, and locate shops that carry them. You can use the app or the web version.\nWith this feature, you are guaranteed to have easy access to what you need without having to waste time.\nLocating Ice with the Google Maps App\nIf you're using the app, here's what you need to do:\n- Keep your app updated for the best results.\n- Enter \"buy ice near me\" or \"buy ice\" in the search bar to have proper results.\n- Scroll down the list and search for stores that are marked as \"Ice supplier\" to find the most precise matches.\n- Press the store to see details, such as store hours and phone number.\n- After selecting a store, press \"Directions\" to drive or \"Save\" to save the location for later.\nLocating Ice with Google Maps on the Web\nFor web users, Android Police recommends the following steps:\n- Go to maps.google.com or click \"Maps\" in the Google Apps menu.\n- Type \"buy ice near me\" or \"buy ice\" if you're looking in a different area.\n- Select a store from the list. You'll have three options:\n- Get a route to the store.\n- Bookmark the store for later.\n- Share the location with your mobile device for on-the-go navigation.\nCheck Google's Crisis Sheet Before Venturing Out\nIf you're taking a last-minute journey to procure ice or other essentials, it's important to remain vigilant about any crisis-related information. Google Maps has a Crisis Sheet that gives real-time alerts regarding current emergencies in certain locations.\nHow to Check for Crisis Alerts\n- Open Google Maps on mobile or the web.\n- Click or tap on the location you're going to visit.\n- If there is an active crisis, a red alert will be displayed at the top of the map.\n- Do not travel to unsafe areas by viewing this information before leaving your home. Being aware can assist you in making safer choices during crises.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission."

      "text": "Google will introduce a new desktop mode on Android 16. Thanks to Samsung, this feature will attempt to compete with its own DeX experience, letting users run apps on resizable windows, with a taskbar at the bottom for enhanced navigation and multitasking.\nHowever, while tablets are being treated to the full desktop experience, users of foldable phones will be dismayed to hear they're being excluded, at least for now.\nWindowed App Support Arrives on Android Tablets\nAndroid users have used split-screen mode to multitask among several apps for years. However, as tablets and bigger screen devices have increased in popularity, that mode has begun to feel its constraints. According to Android Police, Android 16 solves that by bringing full windowed multitasking, just like how apps behave on Windows or macOS.\nTablet owners can soon try this feature, whether their devices are plugged into an external display or not. With that, they could access the full desktop experience. That's resizable windows, a taskbar, and multi-monitor support.\nWith a linked display, Android 16 even offers drag-and-drop for windows between screens and multiple copies of the same app running at once. It's for those who love to be more productive.\nFoldables Left Out of On-Device Desktop Experience\nEven though they have big folding screens, foldable phones will not have the same native desktop functionality. Google told Ars Technica that phones such as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will merely support the windowed desktop mode on an external display, not on the device's screen itself.\nThis is a lost chance. Foldables are created to erase the differentiation between phone and tablet, providing ample display space for sophisticated multitasking. But without native on-device desktop mode, users cannot maximize their capability for productivity.\nPerhaps this restriction will be temporary. As foldables become more mainstream and popular, Google might ultimately include on-device desktop mode support for these blended devices.\nDesktop Mode Support Could Differ Between Android Brands\nWhile Google is spearheading the effort, not every Android 16 device will see full desktop mode capability. The search giant is leaving that up to individual makers. Your favorite brand, unless it's Pixel or Samsung, will likely bypass full desktop support and instead be content with simple external display mirroring.\nThat level of fragmentation can result in a muddled experience for Android users based on what device they have. On the bright side, Samsung has a good history of doing this and should bring a seamless desktop experience to its future Galaxy tablets and, potentially, some phones.\nNew 90:10 Split-Screen Mode Enhances Small-Screen Multitasking\nGoogle is also streamlining multitasking on smaller screens with a new 90:10 split-screen mode. One app can occupy 90% of the screen while another app uses the other 10%, either at the top or bottom. It's a wonderful way to keep an auxiliary app, such as a calculator, video, or chat window, in sight without sacrificing the primary task.\nSamsung has already implemented this feature in the initial Android 16-based One UI 8 beta for Galaxy S25 users, providing us with a premature glimpse of how it can improve real-world usage.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
