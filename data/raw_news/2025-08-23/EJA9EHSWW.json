      "text": "1. A rice water cleansing oil I think should be a staple in your affordable K-beauty repertoire, removing every trace of makeup while avoiding that super tight feeling of rubbing your skin raw.\nPromising review: \"This is really nice! I got it mostly as makeup remover, and it works REALLY well with only a small amount of product, so it lasts forever! I got it like a year and a half ago, I think, and I still have like 3/4 of the bottle (granted, I use it mostly when I do eye makeup, which is not that often). In general, I highly recommend! It doesn't irritate my skin and cleans very well!\" \u2014Josefina Reyes\nGet it from Amazon for $15.\nCheck out more skincare products for low-maintenance people who want high-maintenance results!\n2. A classic bottle of Garnier micellar water that's a gentle cleanser, makeup remover, toner, and all-around magical skin liquid that I'll never stop buying, because it just takes off my makeup so darn well and feels like...water.\nPsst...when Buzzfeed Reviews was still around, this was our low-priced pick for best makeup remover!\nPromising review: \"I\u2019ve tried several makeup removers over the years, but Garnier\u2019s Micellar Cleansing Water is by far one of the best. It removes all traces of makeup \u2014 including waterproof mascara \u2014 without any harsh rubbing or stinging. I love that it doubles as a toner, leaving my skin feeling fresh, clean, and hydrated. What makes this product stand out is how gentle it is. I have sensitive skin, and this doesn\u2019t cause any irritation or redness. It\u2019s fragrance-free, non-greasy, and doesn\u2019t leave any residue behind.\" \u2014Muzaffar Ahmed\nGet it from Amazon for $8.97 (available in a two-pack).\n3. A Farmacy Green Clean cleansing balm with a ~gorge~ creamy texture, natural ingredients like sunflower and ginger root oil, turmeric and moringa extract, and papaya enzymes for some added gentle exfoliation.\nPlus, the jar and all the pieces included are 100% recyclable!\nAccording to former BuzzFeed Shopping writer Christine Forbes: \"This was the first oil-based cleanser I ever used. I'm so glad I got a sample because I really sucked at taking off makeup. Luckily, this balm melted into my skin like butter. Rather than scrubbing feverishly with a water-based cleanser, I simply massaged this into my skin. Slowly, my makeup turned to brown sludge and dripped down the drain. My bare face was pretty dang clean and noticeably less dehydrated. I've repurchased this item twice since 2018 because a little goes a long way.\"\nPromising review: \"This cleanser is awesome at taking off all of my makeup at the end of the day. I love the scent and I always feel fresh afterwards!\" \u2014Michele\nGet it from Amazon for $12+ (available in three sizes and two scents).\n4. A pack of oil-free Almay eye makeup-removing pads that are made of...wait for it...100% biodegradable fibers, so you can feel a little better about using as many as you need to take off every ounce of your makeup.\nPromising review: \"These things are like magic. I have been wearing prominent eyeliner for most of my makeup-wearing career, and I had accepted as a part of life that it would always be a pain to remove. I've tried a lot of different products that people lauded as being awesome for eye makeup removal, and while some worked a lot better than others, nothing really made the process 'easy.' Now, I have found these, and they are a game-changer. I used them for the first time last night, and I could not believe it: 90% of the makeup came off with the first swipe, and the rest came off with the next. Nothing smeared. I am still incredulous this morning. From now on, this will definitely be my go-to product.\" \u2014Elana\nGet a pack of 80 from Amazon for $5.58 (available in 80- or 120-count jars and a two-pack of 120 each).\nCheck out more easy-to-use products to help you ease into a skincare routine!\n5. A DHC cleansing oil infused with olive oil and vitamin E, leaving your skin moist and healthy without stripping it of its natural oils. Japanese cleansing oils are a cult fave for skincare nerds everywhere, and now, it's your turn to obsess.\nPromising review: \"This is the best makeup remover cleanser hands down, and I've tried a lot! I wear foundation every day and wouldn't be without this. No cleanser removes makeup better than an oil-based cleanser for those who've never tried. Don't be afraid, even if you have oily or problematic skin. I do, and I believe this has actually improved my skin. I suffered from acne for a long time. My skin is better now, and this is all I use. I use it at night to remove makeup. Then, exfoliate with a microfiber cloth to remove any makeup left over, and then after showering, I use this again to wash away any residue. I then use it to wash my clean face again in the morning. That's it. No additional cleanser needed, and I find my oil production is more balanced because other cleansers, especially foaming ones, dry out your skin. Only downside is it's hard to find. Amazon is the only retailer that seems to stock it consistently.\" \u2014Dee\nGet it from Amazon for $23+ (available in three sizes and two- and three-packs).\n6. A moisturizing Neutrogena makeup remover whose balm-to-oil formula will melt away your mask for the day with supreme ease, no raccoon eyes or scrubbing to be found.\nPromising review: \"I\u2019ve used a few different brands' makeup removing balms, and so far, this is absolutely my fave! It just melts the makeup right off and doesn\u2019t burn or get gunk left in your eyes. It\u2019s very affordable. You just need a small amount each time to remove a full face of makeup. If you haven\u2019t tried a melting balm or need a new one, this is absolutely the one for you to try. So moisturizing. I love it\" \u2014Paige\nGet it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in a two-pack and as a makeup-removing stick).\n7. A makeup-erasing cloth that I still don't understand the science behind, but according to these glowing reviews, it sure as hell works: Just use some water, and gently swipe all your makeup away. Like, is it black magic?\nPromising review: \"This Makeup Eraser completely transformed my skincare routine. From the first use, I was amazed at how effectively it removes all my makeup with just water. Even stubborn waterproof mascara and long-wear foundation come off effortlessly. The cloth itself is incredibly soft and gentle on my skin. I have sensitive skin that gets irritated easily, but the Makeup Eraser feels soothing and doesn't cause any redness or discomfort. It also has two different sides: one for erasing makeup and the other for exfoliating, which leaves my skin feeling extra clean and smooth. One of the best things about the Makeup Eraser is that it's reusable. I love that I can just toss it in the washing machine after a few uses and it comes out looking and feeling brand new. This has significantly reduced my need for disposable makeup wipes, making it an eco-friendly choice that aligns with my efforts to reduce waste. Overall, the Makeup Eraser has exceeded my expectations. It's effective, gentle, and environmental.\" \u2014Brian Taylor\nGet it from Amazon for $15+ (available in 16 colors).\nThis is also on our list of products with price-defying before and afters!\n8. Or a more affordable plush microfiber makeup-removing cloth to remove ALL makeup (yes, even waterproof makeup) with just water. WATER. The other side exfoliates your face, and afterward you can just toss it into the laundry with everything else.\nPromising review: \"Okay, so I know there\u2019s a ton of reviews for how amazing this thing is, and I really thought it was going to be super overhyped. But seriously \u2014 THIS THING IS AMAZING! Usually, I have to really scrub to get my mascara off, and I\u2019ll typically lose an eyelash or two in the process, but I wet this down and wiped my face once, and everything was off my face and on the towel. And I mean wipe, there was no scrubbing. I literally did a quick wipe expecting it to be just an initial pass, then looked up into the mirror and was like, holy hell, I think it\u2019s all off. I\u2019m in total shock. I have literally never once had a cream, oil, cloth, or otherwise that so effortlessly wiped off my mascara before. There\u2019s got to be some magic going on here...my face thanks you.\" \u2014anonymous\nGet it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in six colors and multipacks).\n9. Anua heartleaf pore-clearing cleansing oil to dissolve makeup residue, blackheads, and excess sebum *without* clogging pores or over-drying skin. Reviewers say that they could actually see the oils and gunk leaving their face \u2014 kinda gross, very satisfying, and a major slay.\nBTW, a lot of reviewers say they use this as part of their double cleansing routine. As the name implies, double cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice: first with an oil-based cleanser, and again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the yucky stuff out of your pores.\nPromising reviews: \"The Anua Oil Cleanser is incredible! I\u2019ve been using it for a few weeks now, and it has completely transformed my skincare routine. It effortlessly removes all my makeup, even waterproof mascara, without any harsh rubbing or irritation. My skin feels clean, smooth, and nourished afterward, not stripped or tight like with some other cleansers. The oil is gentle yet effective at dissolving impurities, leaving my skin glowing and clear. It also helps with the occasional blemish, reducing imperfections over time. I love how it doesn\u2019t clog my pores and is perfect for my sensitive skin. Plus, it has a lovely light scent that makes the whole experience feel luxurious. Highly recommend this cleanser for anyone looking to remove makeup and treat their skin to something special!\" \u2014Rosvita Gewehr\n\"This is my first time ordering an oil-based cleanser and I\u2019m so glad I purchased this one. I originally saw this product on TikTok and wanted to see what the hype was all about. After using the cleanser on my dry face for 2\u20133 minutes, I could visibly see my white- and blackheads on my fingers. I was a little hesitant to try oil cleansing because I have acne-prone skin, however, my face has never looked better. After each use, my face is as soft as a baby's bottom and my scarring doesn\u2019t look as deep! The cleanser has a light clean scent. Not super strong! I am currently pairing this cleanser with the Anua Heartleaf soothing toner to achieve glass skin. #glassskinera\" \u2014Myshel Cagle\nGet it from Amazon for $17.69 (also available in a mild version)\n10.

I found it on TikTok, and OMG!! It works so well. I don't have to sit there and rub the crap out of my eyelashes to get the waterproof mascara off. I will admit, it doesn't take 100% of the makeup off, but about 95% of my makeup comes off. It is not water-resistant, as emulsifying it with water helps take the makeup off. I have not found a better makeup remover, and yes, that includes micellar water (which also works well but leaves my skin feeling oily). With this cleansing balm, my face feels hydrated and smooth. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!!!!! 1000/10 would recommend!!!\" \u2014Deetje Frederick\nGet it from Amazon for $14.99.\n12.

A Lancome eye makeup remover that's been kicking around for a while now \u2014 IYKYK \u2014 but is a classic for a reason. This little number makes dissolving even the most waterproof mascara look supremely easy, and I personally swear by it.\nTo use, shake the bottle to combine the oil and water phases, soak a cotton pad, and hold and press to your eye.

Chanel, Clarins, Mary Kay, Almay, Neutrogena, etc. I always come back to bi-facils. I wear waterproof mascara only, and it takes a powerful remover to get it off. I never have to tug or rub with this product, unlike others. I also have the most sensitive skin around my eyes that reacts to everything. I currently have only one eye moisturizer that I can use due to allergic reactions. This stuff is like magic!\" \u2014Original\nGet it from Nordstrom for $36+ (available in three sizes).\n16. An oil-based cleansing balm making your nighttime routine a luxurious, spa-like affair, in addition to getting rid of all the gunk that accumulates in your pores throughout the day.\nPromising review: \"I got a sample-sized version of this balm from IPSY, and I absolutely loved it, so I bought a full-sized version from Amazon with the same great results. I\u2019ve always hated removing makeup, as micellar water and other makeup remover liquids always leave residual product on my face, even after rubbing my skin raw with cotton rounds or wipes. They also tend to break me out. Not so with Banila Co.\u2019s Clean It Zero balm! I just rub a little chunk of the balm into my skin, and it instantly melts into a creamy emulsion, dissolving any and all makeup with ease. After washing it off and following up with my regular face cleanser, there is not a hint of makeup residue to be found. It\u2019s a game-changer, and everyone who wears makeup or gets their face dirty regularly should try it. Plus, I no longer have to waste cotton rounds on makeup removal, which is great for the environment!\" \u2014Janet\nGet it from Amazon for $17+ (available in 11 styles and a three-pack).\n17.

Worth every cent!\" \u2014Jenn Mehrtens\nGet it from Amazon for $24.\n18. A makeup-removing cleanser so you can wash away the built-up pollutants, crusted up foundation, general skin gunk, and all the bad vibes of the day while treating your skin to a super nourishing treat.\nPromising review: \"Great product! Thanks to this, I can actually look forward to washing my face at night whenever I wear makeup. I treat it like my own personal spa time. I wash my hands first and then dry them, since I don't wanna rub oil with dirty fingers all over my face \u2014 just the thought of that stresses me out enough to break me out! After cleaning my hands, I massage the oil all around my face for a few minutes \u2014 and I really take my time massaging it, especially around my temples to calm down any tension that I've developed throughout the day. A little does the job, but I like to use a full pump because the makeup slides right off. Then, I moisten my hands and massage the milky emulsification off, and along with it goes any makeup, including any stubborn mascara or waterproof gel liner. I've tried other makeup removers in between but always go back to this one \u2014 if you take the extra minute or two to really massage it in, I promise it won't leave a single trace of any makeup behind!\" \u2014Mahpara\nGet it from Amazon for $16+ (available in three sizes).\n19.

A Clinique makeup remover for lids, lashes, and lips that will beat up your matte lipstick, black eyeliner, and most waterproof mascara without even breaking a sweat.\nPromising review: \"I don't think there is anything this product can't remove. This remover is amazing. Takes barely any product, and it removes so much \u2014 without needing to rub hard! Plus, it doesn't irritate the eyes. You would think an oily feel would cause...I don't know...leaking of your eye product, but it doesn't. You put a little of the remover on a cotton pad, wipe, and bam! I highly recommend this. It is awesome.\" \u2014jtlopez16\nGet it from Sephora for $15+ (available in three sizes).\n22.

This is by far the best and most amazing cleansing balm I have ever used. I always found balms to irritate my eyes or leave a film, and this doesn\u2019t do either. It takes my makeup off with no burning and no second cleanse needed. The result is silky, soft skin. The search is over for finding the best cleansing balm. I have also used some of their other products, and they are equally amazing in a comfortable price range. Love this line!\" \u2014Kimeek\nGet it from Sephora for $15+ (available in two sizes).\n30.

It feels good on the skin, my oily skin is enjoying it, and it hasn't caused me to break out or have any other annoying skin problems. My face feels fresh, clean, and hydrated. And hydration + oily skin can sometimes = a scary situation, but this doesn't turn me into, how should I put this, the bottom of a bag of Five Guys fries.

An eye makeup remover so you can remove your eyeliner and mascara with ease instead of taking a wipe to your eyes and rubbing them until a few of your lashes fall out.\nHere's what BuzzFeed Shopping editor Melanie Aman has to say about it: \"This stuff is MAGICAL. I have stick-straight Asian lashes that refuse to hold a curl with wetter mascara formulas. As a result, I have to use waterproof mascara, which is a total pain to remove at night. Instead of rubbing my eyes raw with makeup removers that burn, I apply this like mascara, let it sit for a few minutes, and my waterproof mascara MELTS. Then I go in with a micellar water\u2013soaked cotton pad, and my mascara is gone in 1\u20132 passes.\"\nPromising review: \"I was skeptical because I have always struggled with removing waterproof mascara 100% on the first wash/wipe. I applied it to both my lashes and then immediately washed my face with my normal cleanser, and I felt nothing on my lashes! Like I never applied anything to them.

Use it before moisturizing or mix it in for a full-face coverage. Its rosehip, blue tansy, tamanu, and black cumin seed formula helps to fight current pimples, reduce acne scars, and even prevent future breakouts.\nHuffPost Shopping writer Haley Zovickian says, \"I have had hormonal, cystic acne since adolescence and still deal with painful hormonal acne, plus skin that's somehow dry *and* oily. On top of that, my skin has somehow become more sensitive with every passing year so I'm very careful about what I put on my face. I was initially skeptical that an oil of all things would help my skin, but I LOVE this thing. It is somehow so lightweight while feeling truly nourishing. My breakouts have cleared up since starting this product, and my skin is less oily and more even, like the oil has been balanced out.\n\"I've been looking everywhere for a skincare product with black cumin seed oil (a v underrated antibacterial and anti-inflammatory oil that helps fade pigmentation and is gentle enough to calm even eczema), so I was delighted that it was a main ingredient in this. Also, can I just say the product's push-down (instead of squeezing) dropper packaging is ingenious?!\"\nGet a 0.5 oz. bottle from Amazon for $28 or a 1 oz. bottle direct from Blume for $47."
