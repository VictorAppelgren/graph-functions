  "description": "The owners hope to launch in September after renovating the restaurant space.",
  "content": "The eatery will be in the former home of Dino\u2019s Pizza Restaurant, which closed in June after nearly three decades because its owners retired. Restaurateurs and partners Caleb Ellinas and Vincent Balisciano are currently renovating the 968 Killingworth Road space, with a goal of opening for customers in mid-to-late September.\n\nThe eatery\u2019s name, \u201cChenzo\u2019s,\u201d comes from Balisciano\u2019s nickname. \u201cWe want to become a staple here, where we welcome families, couples on date nights and people who want to come in for a glass of wine,\u201d Balisciano said.\n\nEllinas and Balisciano have been working in the industry for about a decade, since their teens, and they both have restaurant management experience. They have been searching for a place to open their own venture for about two years. Ellinas\u2019 brother has an existing martial arts studio in the same commercial plaza, so this location seemed like a perfect fit, according to the pair.\n\n\u201cOnce we saw the space, we really saw a future here,\u201d Ellinas said. \u201cPeople are really missing Dino\u2019s, but the community has been very supportive. Everyone has been amazing during this whole process.\u201d The space is being renovated, with new flooring, paint, bathrooms and a 12-seat, wood-top bar.\n\n\u201cWe are updating the space to have a modern, contemporary feel,\u201d Ellinas said. The menu will feature offerings such as homemade meatballs and Italian nachos, lobster ravioli, penne in vodka sauce, and Tuscan butter shrimp. The restaurant\u2019s primary focus will be on brick-oven pizza with both classic and unique combinations. One of the pizza selections will feature hazelnuts and local honey, for example. The focus will be on fresh and house-made ingredients, according to the pair. They plan to offer weekly happy hour specials and a half-off wine bottle night. \u201cIt will be contemporary modern Italian food,\u201d Ellinas said. \u201cWe will change the menu as we see what the area wants.\u201d The business is currently seeking applicants for a variety of positions, from bartenders to dishwashers to wait staff. Balisciano said he anticipates they will hire about eight workers.",
