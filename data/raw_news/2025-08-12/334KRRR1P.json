  "title": "West Oso ISD's after-school program to persist after federal funds released",
  "description": "This summer, news of a federal funding pause and reversal caused uncertainty for educational programs like West Oso ISD's after-school program.",
  "content": "\u2022 The funding was later released, ensuring the continuation of the program that provides academic support and enrichment activities.\n\nEvery day last school year, nearly 3 out of 10 West Oso Independent School District students stayed after the last bell of the day for the after-school program.\n\nFor free, they received extra academic support and enrichment. They gardened, cooked, visited colleges, learned to drive and practiced cosmetology. The after-school program hosted edible art events, a chili cook-off, an Earth Day extravaganza, an autism acceptance color run and a summer camp.\n\nThis summer, families were shocked to hear that the federal funding promised to West Oso ISD for the after-school program might not be coming in 2025-26 as the Trump administration announced a freeze in federal education funding.\n\nA few weeks later, the U.S. Education Department decided to release the after-school program funds, as well as other withheld federal education funding.\n\nDuring a town hall meeting ahead of the 2025-26 school year, West Oso ISD Superintendent Kimberly Moore was able to share that the after-school program would be continuing.\n\nCompared to state and local funds, federal funds make up the smallest portion of most Texas public school budgets. But in high-poverty districts like West Oso ISD, that federal portion is significant. Nearly 10% of West Oso ISD\u2019s revenue comes from federal funds, according to the district\u2019s 2024-25 budgeted financial data report. The federal after-school program funding is just a small piece.\n\nAnother local school district, Tuloso-Midway Independent School District, uses federal funds to supplement its dual language program. Tuloso-Midway ISD Superintendent Steve VanMatre participated in a July 29 webinar with several other Texas superintendents on the subject of federal funding.\n\n\"That supplemental funding was so important to giving us the enrichment and the necessary means to do things that we just couldn't support through the general fund or property taxes or state funding,\" VanMatre said during the webinar.\n\nIf the federal after-school funds hadn\u2019t been unfrozen, more than 500 West Oso ISD students would have seen their after-school program diminished and made less accessible.\n\nWhen Dawn Marshall, West Oso\u2019s Texas Afterschool Centers on Education project director, heard of the freeze, she said she felt like crying every day.\n\n\u201cBut I had to put on my game face when I went inside my campuses to let them know we were still moving,\u201d Marshall said, explaining that the team kept planning despite the uncertainty.\n\nWithout the federal grant funding, the program would have been cut down to the \u201cbare minimum.\u201d The district wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep employing the after-school program site coordinators. And whatever program it was able to offer likely would not have been free.\n\nMarshall began researching how much other area after-school programs charged and questioning parents how much they could afford to pay for their child to attend.\n\n\u201cSome said yes, they would be able to afford to pay a certain amount, but some just couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWhen I did the next call to let them know we were good to go, you should have heard the sigh of relief.\u201d\n\nMore than 95% of students in West Oso ISD are considered \u201ceconomically disadvantaged,\u201d which means they meet the federal poverty guidelines for free and reduced-price lunch. Because so many students in the district qualify, the district offers free breakfast, lunch and supper to all students.\n\nThe after-school program is most popular among elementary-aged students, many of whose parents are still working when the regular school day ends.\n\nThe Texas Afterschool Centers on Education program is funded by the federal government through the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Nita. M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Center grant. It\u2019s administered by the Texas Education Agency.\n\nThe program offers targeted academic support, enrichment, college and career readiness activities and family engagement opportunities in schools with high levels of poverty.\n\nAccording to evaluations of Texas ACE, attending Texas ACE has positive impacts for students in reading, math and career and technical education course completion, as well as lowering rates of chronic absenteeism.\n\nStudents have access to more one-on-one time with educators, Marshall said.\n\nHeading into the new school year, West Oso ISD plans to offer the full, free after-school program. The program will reinforce a districtwide emphasis on writing skills.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to move forward as if we still have years to come,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nBut remembering the uncertainty this summer, Marshall said the program will be cautious with spending. If funds are frozen at any point, Marshall hopes enough will have been saved in order to finish out the school year.\n\nFor grant-funded programs, some uncertainty is expected, Marshall said. But that uncertainty is usually tied to whether or not the program will find more funding after the grant ends. It\u2019s less usual for the uncertainty to come mid-grant.\n\nThe 2025-26 school year is the third year of the five-year after-school grant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to move forward and pray there are no pauses,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nSee which Corpus Christi schools have new principals in 2025-26",

      "text": "White House unfreezes $1 billion for after-school, summer programs\nA spokesman for the Trump administration said \"guardrails have been put in place\" to ensure the funding won't violate the president's executive orders.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Amid mounting pressure, the Trump administration is releasing more than $1 billion in paused funding for after-school and summer learning programs.\nOne of Congress's top budget makers, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said on July 18 that the White House committed to unfreeze the funding. The money, which was tied up for weeks, was already earmarked to support 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which provide tutoring and child care to students in high-poverty and low-performing schools.\nA spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget confirmed that the Republican administration's review of the program is over, states will receive the funding and the money cannot be used in violation of the president's executive orders.\nThe money is only a fraction, however, of the more than $6 billion in education funding the Trump administration put on hold on June 30, creating financial uncertainty for many districts. Though schools only receive a relatively small amount of money from the federal government each year, the delay hindered administrators' budgeting ahead of the fall. It also jeopardized programs families rely on, including for adult learners and students whose parents are seasonal workers.\nOn July 14, two dozen blue states and Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit to restore all of the paused funding.\nTwo days later, 10 Senate Republicans expressed frustration over the frozen money. In a rare break with the White House, a group that included Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins of Maine and former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky sent a letter to Russell Vought, who heads the Office of Management and Budget, saying the decision was \"contrary to President Trump's goal of returning K-12 education to the states.\"\n\"Withholding these funds will harm students, families, and local economies,\" they wrote.\nZachary Schermele is an education reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Corpus Christi schools hope to combat absenteeism in 2025-26\n- Chronic absenteeism in Corpus Christi ISD remained high last year, mirroring the previous year's rate at about 28%.\n- Low attendance negatively impacts student learning, graduation rates and school funding.\nAs schools prepare for the 2025-26 school year, local educators hope that students arrive not only for the first day of classes, but for every day after that as well.\nData from recent school years has shown a persistent problem with attendance in Corpus Christi schools.\nIt\u2019s practically a guarantee that at least some desks will be empty any given day \u2014 there\u2019s a reason schools give out perfect attendance awards. But when students are habitually absent, learning suffers.\nThough it\u2019s been years since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted education, school attendance still hasn\u2019t bounced back.\nDuring the 2024-25 school year, 27.6% of Corpus Christi Independent School District students were chronically absent, meaning they missed at least 10% of school days. That\u2019s nearly identical to the district\u2019s 2023-24 chronic absenteeism rate of 27.7%, indicating that progress on keeping children in the classroom stalled last year.\nNearly 4 out of 10 Corpus Christi ISD students were chronically absent in 2021-22, but only 3 out of 10 were in 2022-23.\nDuring a convocation ceremony for all district staff on Aug. 5, Corpus Christi ISD Superintendent Roland Hernandez stressed the importance of attendance and cultivating personal relationships with students.\n\u201cPlease, every day, do at least one thing to help foster strong attendance among our students,\u201d Hernandez told teachers.\nIf a student is absent, teachers should make sure that they know they were missed, Hernandez said. If a student is struggling, schools should offer more support, he said.\nThe school district\u2019s chronic absenteeism rate is higher than the state average. Other area school districts, including the West Oso Independent School District, have similarly high chronic absenteeism rates.\n\u201cIf we want them to learn, if we want them to become better readers, writers, mathematicians, we need them at school,\u201d West Oso ISD Superintendent Kimberly Moore said during a July 31 town hall with parents.\nThe problem isn\u2019t identical across the board; other districts such as Flour Bluff Independent School District and London Independent School District have lower chronic absenteeism rates, according to the most recent annual performance reports from 2023-24.\nData from the 2022-23 and 2021-22 school years also shows that chronic absenteeism was higher for Hispanic students than for White or Black students in Corpus Christi ISD. Special education students have some of the highest rates.\nWhen students aren\u2019t in class, they miss out on key learning, as well as the chance to interact with their peers. Numerous studies have shown that students who are often absent from class score lower in math and reading and are less likely to stay in school and graduate on time.\nBeyond the direct impact on students, low attendance can have implications for the broader school community. In Texas, public school funding is tied to average daily attendance.\nThe dollars are distributed per student. Schools only receive funding for the number of students who were present when the average daily attendance for the year was measured.\nThe greater the disparity is between enrollment and attendance, the greater the funding gaps.\nMore than 33,000 students attended Corpus Christi ISD in 2023-24, but only about 29,000 counted for funding purposes, according to state data.\nAcross Corpus Christi ISD, the attendance rate last school year was about 91%. The rate for elementary schools was a tad higher, more than 92%, but the rate for the high schools was lower, coming in below 89%.\nDistrictwide, the 2024-25 attendance rates also represent a slight decrease from 2023-24.\nThis is despite efforts to boost attendance, such as a partnership with Sames Ford Corpus Christi to give away a car through a drawing to high school students who maintained perfect attendance each six weeks.\nCorpus Christi ISD\u2019s attendance goal is 95%.\nHernandez acknowledged that many of Corpus Christi ISD\u2019s high school students have responsibilities outside of school. They work to help support their families.\nBut employers should understand that a student\u2019s focus should be on school, Hernandez said.\n\u201cTo all of our employers across the city who employ our students while they\u2019re still in school, remember that the highest priority in our students' lives is school \u2014 to not schedule them at work when they should be in classes,\u201d Hernandez said."

      "text": "Years after Corpus Christi ISD ends dual language program, other districts take it on\nWhen educating bilingual students, the largest school district in the Coastal Bend, Corpus Christi ISD, currently relies on a transitional model that aims to move students into mainstream English classrooms within a few years of starting school.\nBut another bilingual education model is growing in popularity locally, with proponents arguing the \u201cdual language\u201d model leads to better outcomes for students. Until a couple of years ago, Corpus Christi ISD had its own dual language program. Since then, other area districts, including Tuloso-Midway ISD and Gregory-Portland ISD, have launched their own.\nOver the past 10 years, the number of bilingual students in Texas has increased substantially. Across the state, 23% of students are considered emergent bilingual, which means they do not speak English as their primary language and have a limited ability to read, speak or understand English when they start school.\nThe state has historically struggled to close the achievement gap between bilingual students and non-bilingual students.\nThe graduation rate for bilingual students is lower than the rate for other students, including economically disadvantaged students. Emergent bilingual students also score below their peers in state assessments and are less likely to be considered college-ready.\nComparing bilingual education models\nTexas has approved six bilingual program models \u2013 English as a Second Language pull-out, ESL content-based, transitional early-exit, transitional late-exit, dual language immersion one-way and dual language immersion two-way.\n- English as a Second Language: In ESL programs, students are taught by ESL-certified teachers who might not be fluent in the student\u2019s native language. In ESL pull-out programs, students are placed in general education classrooms, but sometimes receive group or one-on-one English instruction from an ESL-certified teacher. An ESL program is often the best option for students if their school district does not have a teacher fluent in their native language, for example if there are less than 20 students in the same grade level who speak the same language.\n- Transitional: Students are served in both English and another language and have a bilingual-certified teacher. Early exit programs aim to transition students to English-only instruction after two to five years. In a late exit model, that transition happens between six and seven years after the student enrolls in school.\n- Dual language: The one-way model serves emergency bilingual students with the goal of success in English-only instruction after six or seven years of school. In the two-way model, emergent bilingual students are integrated in the classroom with students who are proficient in English where instruction is given in English and another language, promoting biliteracy for both sets of students.\nThe goal of the ESL and transitional bilingual program models is English proficiency.\nThe dual language, or DLI, program models have the added goals of promoting bilingualism and biliteracy.\nYears of research have shown that students in dual language programs outperform students in transitional and ESL programs.\nA 2004 study of large and small districts in 15 states showed that dual language programs are successful in closing the academic achievement gap between bilingual students and English proficient students.\n\u201cOverwhelming evidence shows that DLI programs are the only instructional programs that close the academic achievement gap between emergent bilingual students and non-emergent bilingual students,\u201d according to a 2023 update to the Texas Effective Dual Language Immersion Framework.\nThe framework cites research showing increased academic achievement, cognitive development, self-regulation, emotional control, flexibility in thinking, planning skills, engagement in higher-level learning, linguistic proficiency, graduation rates, sense of identity and self-esteem and parent engagement and satisfaction.\nIn the Coastal Bend region, most bilingual students are served by transitional early-exit programs. Years ago, Corpus Christi ISD offered a dual language program. It doesn\u2019t anymore.\nAcross the region, only a small handful of students \u2014 less than 30 in Gregory-Portland \u2014 were served in a dual language classroom last year, according to the Texas Education Agency\u2019s 2022-2023 Emergent Bilingual/English Learner Program Report.\nBut that is now changing.\nGregory-Portland ISD first began offering dual language in 2022-23. Tuloso-Midway ISD launched a program this fall.\nTuloso-Midway ISD focuses on closing achievement gaps for bilingual students\nIn line with state and national trends, bilingual students in Tuloso-Midway ISD have historically underperformed compared to other students.\n\u201cWe were unintentionally creating learning gaps for kids \u2014 asking them not to speak their native language, teaching them in a language they were unfamiliar with, meant they were getting these huge academic gaps \u2014 while they could cognitively do whatever we were asking, linguistically, they didn\u2019t understand,\u201d T-MISD assistant director of curriculum and instruction Kenna Moody said.\nBy the time their language ability caught up, students were already behind in academics.\nTo address this, Tuloso-Midway ISD turned to the dual language model. T-MISD Superintendent Steve VanMatre championed dual language in the district, instructing the leaders of Tuloso-Midway Primary School to implement a dual language program.\nThough there is a shortage of bilingual educators in the state, the school already had a well-staffed bilingual staff and was able to add two new bilingual-certified teachers.\nAdditionally, two of the school\u2019s leaders, Principal Laura Davila and assistant principal Nidia De La Cerda both have experience as bilingual educators. Some educators on staff, including De La Cerda, had prior experience as dual language teachers.\nTo start the program, Tuloso-Midway ISD turned to G\u00f3mez and G\u00f3mez, a consulting firm specializing in dual language. The firm\u2019s founders, brothers Leo and Richard G\u00f3mez, were both professors of bilingual education at universities in Texas and have been helping school districts implement dual language programs for three decades.\nThis year, the school added a dual language program in pre-K, kindergarten and first grade at Tuloso-Midway Primary School. Eventually, as these students progress through school, the district plans to offer dual language through fifth grade.\nThere are two dual language classrooms in kindergarten and first grade and one classroom at the pre-K level because not all students start school in pre-K.\nDual language is the only bilingual program offered in pre-K, kindergarten and first grade, serving all bilingual students. Until dual language is rolled out for all elementary grade levels, the district will continue to offer transitional bilingual programs.\nThrough a two-way immersion model, students whose primary language is Spanish and students whose primary language is English are placed together in classrooms with bilingual teachers.\nStudents learn to read in their native language. Math lessons are in English and science and social studies are taught in Spanish.\n\u201cWe genuinely believe that if we teach them the academic skills in their native language, the language part of things will happen by exposure,\u201d Moody said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to take their reading and phonics knowledge and transition that into either language as they get older.\u201d\nTeaching academics early in a student\u2019s native language also helps educators identify potential learning disabilities or struggles, Moody said. Otherwise, it can be hard to tell if a child is struggling because they don\u2019t have the language skills or because they need special education services. It\u2019s also easier to identify gifted and talented students earlier, Moody said.\nThe goal in dual language is for students to learn from each other, supporting and helping one another understand both languages.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the academic skills in our students \u2014 both our native Spanish speakers and our English students \u2014 how they have progressed,\u201d Davila said.\nFor English-proficient students, there\u2019s a waiting list to get into the program.\nMany of the English-proficient students in the program come from bilingual households and have family members who speak Spanish. Some have parents whose own parents spoke Spanish, but after growing up speaking English in the classroom, weren\u2019t able to maintain their own bilingual abilities.\nThis is partially due to historical practices that discouraged the use of Spanish in schools in Texas, the impacts of which are still being felt today.\n\u201cMy mom got in trouble for speaking Spanish in school, so when we were growing up, she did not want us to speak Spanish,\u201d assistant principal Lepe Chapa said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want us to have an accent because she had a bad experience with it. Now, everybody wants to be bilingual... that these kids are going to be able to grow up speaking Spanish and writing and reading in Spanish and English, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nDe La Cerda\u2019s first language growing up was Spanish. She was placed in a transitional bilingual classroom in pre-K, transitioning to an English classroom by kindergarten.\n\u201cTo see these kids not have to go through that, as a native Spanish speaker, it\u2019s something that I appreciate because these kids don\u2019t have to lose their language,\u201d De La Cerda said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help them keep it.\u201d\nOther students come from entirely English-speaking backgrounds, but their parents hope that speaking Spanish will benefit them in life.\n\u201cOur parents have been extremely supportive of the program,\u201d Davila said.\nFor Spanish-dominant students, having Spanish coursework allows parents to become more involved with their child\u2019s learning.\n\u201cThe parents are very happy with the fact that they can support them,\u201d De La Cerda said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to some parents who (had students in a transitional program) last year and are in dual language this year and they just love knowing that the kids come home, and they can help them with their reading and they can help them with science and social studies.\u201d\nRegardless of background, students in the program are engaged and excited in the classroom, school staff said.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the hallways or if we\u2019re just passing by and we walk into the classroom, the students are ready to show us their Spanish,\u201d Davila said.\nThe program has instilled a sense of pride in bilingual students, staff said.\n\u201cBefore, it was like, \u2018I have to learn everybody else\u2019s language\u2019,\u201d De La Cerda said. \u201cBut now, there\u2019s a value placed on that language and everybody notices that value.\u201d\nTo further integrate the program into the wider campus community, the school plays morning announcements and the pledge of allegiance in English and Spanish for all students and includes signs and labels in both languages in the hallways.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just in isolation,\u201d Davila said. \u201cWe are promoting biliteracy across the campus and that\u2019s only going to get better as we go on.\u201d\nBecause the two-way model relies on a consistent ratio of Spanish and English students, growth of the program is limited by the district\u2019s bilingual student enrollment.\nKindergartener Isabella Campos comes from a bilingual household. Her father Paco grew up in a Spanish-speaking household, while her mother Kandice has an English-speaking background, though her parents are bilingual.\nBoth Paco and Kandice Campos believe that being bilingual is an advantage in the workplace. Paco added that it's also important to him that his children learn Spanish so that they can remain connected with older family members.\n\"Spanish was spoken in my home, but I didn't learn to speak it well and it was lost,\" Kandice Campos said. \"We didn't want that to happen to her.\"\nHow Texas approaches bilingual education\nUntil about 50 years ago, Texas schools taught only in English.\nA 1972 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, based on a hearing held in San Antonio in 1968 and a 1969 survey of Mexican American education in the Southwest found that many schools in Texas in particular discouraged the use of Spanish on schoolgrounds.\nNorma Guzman is a professor of bilingual education and doctoral program coordinator at Texas A&M University-Kingsville. Before moving to higher education, Guzman was a school psychologist trained in bilingual assessments.\n\u201cHistorically bilingual ed was established as part of the civil rights era,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cThe initial programs were part of that social justice movement to ensure that English language learners were getting an equitable education.\u201d\nDuring the 1960s and '70s, South Texas civil rights advocates called attention to discriminatory practices against Mexican American students.\nIn the 1960s, some schools began experimenting with bilingual education models. In 1968, the Bilingual Education Act created a federal policy for bilingual education.\nCorpus Christi ISD was the subject of a 1970 court case noting that the district had knowingly implemented discriminatory practices and segregated against Mexican American students.\nIn 1972, students in Robstown boycotted school for a month in response to a lack of bilingual and bicultural programming, calling for an end to discriminatory policies against Mexican American students and for the introduction of Chicano history courses.\nFormer senator Carlos Truan, who represented Nueces and Kleberg counties in the Texas Legislature, successfully sponsored the Texas Bilingual Education Act in 1973. Truan was a state representative at the time.\nThe act directed school districts with 20 or more students in the same grade sharing the same language to institute a bilingual instruction program beginning in 1974-75. It also helped fund bilingual education programs.\nIn the early 1970s, Texas A&M University-Kingsville launched a bilingual teacher preparation program for undergraduates and a bilingual education doctoral program.\nMany early bilingual programs focused on helping student learn English so that they could be successful in mainstream classrooms. But, at the same time, another type of program gained steam \u2013 dual language.\nDual language programs often include English-proficient and English-learner students, with the goal of creating bilingual, bicultural and biliterate students.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had dual language as a form of education since the \u201860s and probably before that,\u201d Guzman said, referencing a program formed in Florida in 1963 to serve Cuban refugees.\nThe first dual language immersion bill in Texas passed in 2001, focusing on biliteracy goals. In 2019, the Texas Legislature approved a new dual language program allotment to incentivize school districts to offer dual language programs, particularly for emergent bilingual students.\nIn the 21st century, part of the appeal of dual language programs are the academic benefits to English-speaking students.\n\u201cIt has become a program of choice for districts,\u201d Guzman said.\nBut emergent bilingual students can also benefit greatly from a dual language program.\n\u201cTo have that foundational amount of instruction in their native language really is the biggest predictor of how well they\u2019re going to do academically,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cThe more time they spend in the classroom with their native language, developing that academic language, really is the key to having them transfer those skills over to the language of instruction.\u201d\nTransitional programs can sometimes be more like a \u201ccrutch,\u201d Guzman said, as opposed to a long-term solution.\nDistricts who launched dual language programs often maintained them for several years, so that children who started elementary school in a dual language program could finish elementary school in a program.\nBut Guzman said, when funding dries up, dual language programs sometimes disappear. At the same time, districts across the state and nation can also struggle to find bilingual teachers.\nCorpus Christi ISD\nCorpus Christi ISD first launched a dual language program in the mid-1990s. The program lasted until 2022, when the district shifted focus to pre-K at the Early Childhood Development Center.\nRebecca Palacios was a part of the first generation of bilingual teachers in Corpus Christi in the 1970s. She retired in 2009.\n\u201cThe biggest difference with my generation is that even though we knew Spanish, we really never got Spanish education,\u201d Palacios said. \u201cWe were punished for speaking it. Even though we were Spanish speakers and grew up with it, we never had any formal, Spanish education. It was always English.\u201d\nWhen she first became a bilingual teacher, Palacios was trained in the transitional bilingual education method.\n\u201cWe taught Spanish to get them quickly speaking English,\u201d Palacios said. \u201cThat was the whole point... basically, you\u2019re extinguishing the language \u2014 you're taking away as you move forward.\u201d\nIn the beginning, there weren\u2019t many materials in Spanish for teachers, and what did exist often relied on Spanish from Spain that differed from the vocabulary local children were familiar with, Palacios said.\nBilingual educators began working together to create and share more appropriate materials through groups like the National Association for Bilingual Education, the Texas Association for Bilingual Education and the Corpus Christi Association for Bilingual Education, a group that eventually folded over the years.\nWhen Corpus Christi ISD began implementing dual language, Palacios found it to be \u201cfar superior.\u201d Palacios has published books in English and Spanish for dual language families.\nIn 1995, Corpus Christi ISD and A&M-Corpus Christi partnered on a \u201cschool of the future\u201d with a dual language model. Palacios was selected as the lead teacher for the pre-K 3-year program.\nAfter a few years, Palacios started a dual language program at Zavala Elementary School. A federal grant helped start dual language programs at Zavala and Garcia elementary schools.\nBut the programs didn\u2019t last. Eventually the district switched back to focus on the transitional early-exit model, which is how most elementary-age emergent bilingual students are currently served.\nDuring the 2021-22 school year, the TEA's Emergent Bilingual/English Learner Program Report documents 778 students in transitional programs, about 30 in dual language and over 375 in an alternative bilingual program in Corpus Christi ISD. Over 80 non-bilingual students were also in a dual language program.\nAt the secondary level, bilingual students are served through ESL programs. The program also includes parental engagement and events. In January, the district hosted an event for students focused on supporting students on the path to college.\nIn the ESL program, teachers use strategies such as visuals with vocabulary cards, gestures and cognates to help students when there is something they don\u2019t understand. Students who speak a wide variety of languages are part of the program.\nAt the elementary level, 19 campuses offer bilingual programs. Previously, the district had a transitional program at each district elementary school. But after years with the district unable to find enough bilingual certified teachers, the district shifted to a centralized model this year.\nIn 2022-23, the district was short nearly 90 bilingual certified teachers. Under the centralized model, more bilingual students are in the classroom with a bilingual teacher.\nStudents zoned to schools without a transitional program were moved to neighboring campuses with programs. Every campus still offers ESL programs for students speaking other languages, such as Vietnamese, Chinese, Russian and German.\nIn CCISD transitional programs, students are taught by bilingual certified teachers and provided supports to help them be successful in listening, speaking, writing and reading.\nWhen a student scores high enough on a standardized test measuring English proficiency, they are reclassified and moved into English classrooms.\n\u201cWe have the bilingual early exit model where students can reclassify at the end of first grade or after having been in the program for two consecutive years,\u201d CCISD director for special programs and curriculum and instruction Zonia Lopez said.\nIn addition to gaining English proficiency, transitional bilingual programs also aim to allow students to keep their native language, Lopez said.\n\u201cThe goal, to me, of the bilingual program is to use the student\u2019s native language to acquire the English language and continue to use their native language,\u201d Lopez said.\nCooperation and engagement are currently on the rise among Corpus Christi bilingual educators. Years after the dissolution of the Corpus Christi Association for Bilingual Education, local educators have formed a new group \u2014 the Coastal Bend Association for Bilingual Education.\nThis group includes members from around the region whose schools operate a variety of different bilingual programs, including Corpus Christi ISD and Tuloso-Midway ISD.\nLooking forward, Palacios believes that for new successful dual language programs to succeed, schools need community support.\n\u201cIf you put that energy in there and that supportive piece from the community, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Palacios said.\nHere's how Driscoll Children's Hospital has provided therapy in Corpus Christi ISD\nAcademics and post-graduation readiness: Corpus Christi ISD reflects on 2022-23\nKingsville ISD switched to a shortened school week this year.

  "argos_summary": "The West Oso Independent School District's after-school program, which provides essential academic support and enrichment activities to students, will continue after federal funding was unblocked by the U.S. Education Department. The program is crucial for the district, where nearly 95% of students are economically disadvantaged, and federal funds make up a significant portion of its budget. The release of these funds alleviated concerns about potential cuts that would have affected over 500 students, allowing the program to maintain its offerings and support for families.",
