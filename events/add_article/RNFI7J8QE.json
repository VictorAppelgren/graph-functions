      "summary": "Krispy Kreme's stock has plummeted 73% from its annual highs, largely due to the failure of a costly partnership with McDonald's that was intended to expand doughnut delivery. The company has since pulled the plug on the nationwide rollout of this program, citing high infrastructure costs, and is now reevaluating its logistics to focus on more profitable delivery routes. While there is potential for a turnaround with new partnerships, investor sentiment remains cautious following the disappointing McDonald's experiment.",
