      "summary": "The article highlights the growing importance of T‑levels, England’s two‑year technical qualifications, in bridging the skills gap and meeting employer demand for industry‑ready talent. It cites a 91% pass rate and strong outcomes across sectors, while noting that only a third of employers currently offer the required industry placements. MPs and the Public Accounts Committee urge the Department for Education to launch a campaign to raise awareness, increase enrolments, and ensure sufficient placement opportunities, warning that without these measures T‑levels risk remaining a minority pursuit. The piece also discusses the government’s plan to cut low‑enrolment vocational courses while expanding T‑levels, and calls for a balanced approach that preserves alternative pathways such as BTecs to avoid leaving students without suitable options.",
