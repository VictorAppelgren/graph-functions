  "title": "3 underrated Netflix movies you should watch this weekend (August 8-10)",
  "description": "These Netflix movies were all released in 2023, and all three of them deserved more attention than they got at the time.",
  "content": "When Netflix introduced streaming, it fundamentally changed the way we watch everything. And, while streaming has come with plenty of perks, it\u2019s also given us more choices about what we can watch, which necessarily leaves us wondering what we should spend time watching.\n\nIf you\u2019ve browsed Netflix for something worthy of your time and decided that you should go to bed instead, you\u2019re not alone. We\u2019ve pulled together a list of three underrated movies on Netflix that are all worth your time.\n\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nAn original sci-fi movie with a terrific cast that didn\u2019t get the eyeballs it deserved, They Cloned Tyrone follows three people tied together by circumstance who begin to uncover a sinister government conspiracy.\n\nThe movie\u2019s premise \u2014 a man realizes that he\u2019s been cloned \u2014 is super stylish and the perfect combination of absurd and serious. They Cloned Tyrone is anchored by its three central performances and a particular reminder of how skilled Jamie Foxx and John Boyega both are when they have the right material.\n\nYou can watch They Cloned Tyrone on Netflix.\n\nGenerally speaking, it\u2019s hard to describe anything that Wes Anderson directed as underrated. The writer/director is hugely popular among film fans, and his movies usually debut to critical acclaim. Unfortunately, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, as well as three other Roald Dahl short stories that he adapted for Netflix in 2023, did not receive the attention they deserve.\n\nThis one tells the story of a billionaire who becomes enthralled by his desire to acquire a particular, rare skill and devotes his life to it. Henry Sugar is funny, moving, and among the most stylish things that Anderson has ever directed. Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect centerpiece for this odd tale.\n\nYou can watch The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar on Netflix.\n\nAn adaptation of the Alice Walker novel and 1985 film of the same name, this version of The Color Purple is a musical and a fascinating improvement on the original. It follows Celie, an introverted housewife in the Deep South who overcomes an abusive husband and a decades-long separation from her sister to find the life that she wants.\n\nFeaturing stylish musical numbers, great songs, and an enduring central story, The Color Purple also features several incredible performances, including ones from Taraji P. Henson and Danielle Brooks that deserved more attention.\n\nYou can watch The Color Purple on Netflix.",

      "text": "The best Netflix movies of 2023 include an eclectic mix of titles, from thrillers to black comedies. Netflix has fully hit its stride, and the streaming service is cranking out new movies like they\u2019re chocolates on Valentine\u2019s Day. This means a lot of great titles get lost in the shuffle. In some cases, a few negative opinions might convince you one isn\u2019t worth watching. But when it comes to movies that are polarizing, it\u2019s always a good idea to check them out for yourself.\nThe underrated 2023 Netflix movies you need to watch in 2024, however, were well-reviewed and/or well-received by audiences. But generally, they\u2019re even better than the sum of the commentary that surrounds them.\nThey Cloned Tyrone\nIt\u2019s no surprise that a movie starring John Boyega and Jamie Foxx would be this good. But chances are, you probably haven\u2019t even heard of They Cloned Tyrone. The sci-fi comedy mystery is about a trio (which also includes The Marvels\u2019 Teyonah Parris) who uncover a sinister conspiracy relating to government cloning. The unlikely team of pseudo investigators, which includes a drug dealer, his customer, and a sex worker, are now deep in a situation they never thought imaginable.\nOriginal, fun, and delightfully satirical, They Cloned Tyrone has been praised by reviewers as being provocative and clever. The \u201cexceptional cast\u201d has also received high marks. The movie only received a limited release in theaters, after which it began streaming on Netflix last summer. It has all the makings of becoming a cult classic that is only truly appreciated long after release.\nStream They Cloned Tyrone on Netflix.\nYou Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah\nMost people have a preconceived notion when they think of an Adam Sandler movie. But as the funny man has proven time and time again with performances in movies like Punch-Drunk Love, Uncut Gems, and Hustle, there are layers to him and he can pull off more serious roles and writing. In You Are Not So Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, however, Sandler takes a back seat to his real-life daughter, Sunny, who stars as Stacy, a young woman who can\u2019t wait for her big Bat Mitzvah. She\u2019s sharing it with her best friend, Lydia (Samantha Lorraine). But as teenage drama would dictate, their mutual crush on a boy named Andy (Dylan Hoffman) gets in the way.\nA sweet coming-of-age story, some initially screamed nepotism at Sandler\u2019s casting of his own daughters (not to mention wife) in the movie. But the result proves that Sandler\u2019s confidence in their performances was not unfounded. He might deliver a dud movie every now and then, but You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah is not one of them.\nStream You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah on Netflix.\nPamela, A Love Story\nYou might think you know everything there is to know about actress and model Pamela Anderson, her relationship with Tommy Lee, and that infamous sex tape. But Pamela, A Love Story is completely different from what you might expect it to be. A documentary, the movie takes you into the private (and quiet) life of Anderson, who regales with stories of her career and personal struggles, from the most rewarding moments to the most difficult.\nShe\u2019s honest, open, and presents as a mother first who lives for her children (and always has). Not everything is what it seems. Anderson might conjure up a specific idea in your head, but Pamela, A Love Story will have you gaining new respect for the woman who was thrust into the spotlight as a sex symbol and became the poster girl for a trend she never wished to be part of.\nStream Pamela, A Love Story on Netflix.\nOld Dads\nHow could the combination of Bill Burr, Bobby Cannavale, and Bokeem Woodbine be anything but comedy gold? In Old Dads, three men in their 50s sell their business to millennials and find themselves dealing with an entirely new cultural and generational world that has seemingly left them behind. Combined with navigating parenthood in this same strange space, the men put their foots in their mouths at every turn.\nAccording to critics, Old Dads is not worth the watch. It\u2019s described as a cookie-cutter bro comedy that\u2019s obnoxious and vulgar. Would you expect anything more? Knowingly go in expecting just that, and Old Dads is actually quite relatable. Indeed, on review aggregator sites like Rotten Tomatoes, critics pan the movie but the audience score screams loud and clear that this movie is sorely underrated. Fans of Burr\u2019s stand-up comedy and Cannavale\u2019s signature eccentric style will appreciate every moment. \u201cOld dads\u201d across the nation will be raising their fists in the air and belly-laughing all the way through.\nStream Old Dads on Netflix.\nLeave the World Behind\nBased on the 2020 novel by Rumaan Alam, Leave the World Behind is a different kind of horror story. The technology we have become so reliant on, like our phones, internet, and TVs, slowly stops working. Other strange things are happening that suggest some type of technological breakdown. Is the end nigh?\nIn one of those rare instances, critics seem to love Leave the World Behind while audiences have not responded as positively. If you\u2019re a fan of Sam Esmail\u2019s other projects, including Mr. Robot and Homecoming, you\u2019ll appreciate the tone and slower pacing of Leave the World Behind. If you\u2019re looking for intense, fast action, it might not be the right movie for you. But there\u2019s no denying that the apocalyptic psychological thriller will spark conversation, which is really its ultimate intention. With strong performances from Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, and Kevin Bacon, some might see Leave the World Behind as just another copycat Black Mirror-esque apocalyptic warning story about technology and the future. But it\u2019s smart, suspenseful, beautifully acted, and well worth your time and the watercooler chats you\u2019ll inevitably have after watching it.\nStream Leave the World Behind on Netflix."

      "text": "Netflix is leaning into summer blockbuster season with a fury of great action and adventure this month. It wouldn\u2019t be the summer without some terror in the ocean from Jaws, one of the most influential horror movies of all time. Speaking of influential, Mad Max: Fury Road changed action movies for the better and has a legitimate claim for best of the 21st century.\nWith over 3,000 movies on the service, it can be intimidating to choose one. This guide will help you narrow down your choices. Also, check out the most popular movies on Netflix to see what\u2019s trending on the service.\nLooking for something else? We\u2019ve also rounded up the best new movies to stream, the best shows on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime, and the best movies on Disney+.\nWatching from abroad? Use a Netflix VPN to access your country\u2019s catalog from anywhere in the world. Want to watch on the go? We can show you how to download movies on Netflix.\nEditor\u2019s Picks\nJaws (1975)\nWhen the most influential blockbuster of all time is on a streaming service, it must be featured in a \u201cbest of\u201d list. The aforementioned blockbuster is Jaws, Steven Spielberg\u2019s seminal classic about a great white shark terrorizing the residents of a small beach town in New England. When the mayor refuses to close the beaches, it leads to several deaths and causes widespread panic.\nPolice Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) finally receives approval to hunt the shark. Along with oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and boat captain Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody heads out to sea to kill the shark. The three men quickly learn that in the battle of man versus beast, the beast takes no prisoners.\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n30 years after Beyond Thunderdome, George Miller helmed his magnum opus, Mad Max: Fury Road. While traveling across the Wasteland, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is captured by Immortan Joe\u2019s War Boys and brought to his fortress, the Citadel. Meanwhile, Joe\u2019s top lieutenant, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), escapes in an armored truck, the War Rig, with Joe\u2019s five wives.\nDuring the confusion, Max escapes the Citadel and eventually links up with Furiosa. The road warrior cuts a deal with Furiosa and agrees to help the women escape to freedom. The ensuing chaos is some of the most thrilling and captivating chase sequences captured in cinema.\nNonnas (2025)\nFood is love, and that phrase provides the heartbeat for Nonnas, a family dramedy helmed by Stephen Chbosky. Brooklyn native Joe Scaravella (Vince Vaughn) finds himself at a crossroads in life after the death of his mother. After receiving his mother\u2019s life insurance money, Joe opens an Italian restaurant in Staten Island.\nDespite having no culinary experience, Joe believes the secret to a restaurant\u2019s success lies with the chefs. Joe hires four grandmothers (Lorraine Bracco, Talia Shire, Brenda Vaccaro, and Susan Sarandon), or \u201cNonnas,\u201d to cook his mother\u2019s recipes. It\u2019s a huge gamble, but Joe believes that once customers experience his place, it will bring them back to their childhood.\nOther Netflix Movies\nPig (2021)\nNever get between a man and his pig. In 2021, Pig gave Nicolas Cage his John Wick moment, not because this is a bloody action tale of revenge. It\u2019s really not that at all. But it was easily the high point of Cage\u2019s recent career and a chance to see him once again inhabit a purely unique character that only he could play. Rob Feld (Cage) used to be one of the most famous chefs in Portland. Some would say that he\u2019s fallen pretty far since then, but he is content to gather truffles with the help of his pig. When the pig is stolen, Rob figures out pretty quickly who did it. And that was their first mistake, because Rob isn\u2019t going to stop until he has that pig back.\nBarbarian (2022)\nBarbarian made quite splash in theaters when it hit theaters in 2022 and propelled writer/director Zach Cregger to the top of the horror genre. The key to this film\u2019s appeal is to go into it with as little information as possible, so we won\u2019t be sharing major spoilers here.\nGeorgina Campbell and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd star as Tess and Keith, a pair of strangers who are accidentally booked at the same rental cabin. During a nasty storm, Keith invites Tess to stay with him for the night, and it sounds like the set up to every rom-com ever. Trust us, it\u2019s not. There are strange things happening in this rental that you have to see to believe. And to even describe what comes next would be to ruin the surprise.\nFear Street: Prom Queen (2025)\nAfter four years, R.L. Stein\u2019s Fear Street series continues with Fear Street: Prom Queen. The year is 1988, and the school outcast, Lori Granger (India Fowler), is taking a bold swing by going out for prom queen. Everyone knows the queen bee, Tiffany Falconer (Fina Strazza), is going to win.\nOr so everyone thought. Lori is making it a much closer contest than expected, possibly because someone is killing the other girls involved with the prom. Lori and Tiffany may not see eye-to-eye, but they may both be feeling the heat when the killer turns their eyes towards them.\nThe Wild Robot (2024)\nIf you\u2019ve wondered why The Wild Robot is so acclaimed, it\u2019s because it has an unusually large amount of heart for a DreamWorks Animation movie. It\u2019s also gorgeously rendered, and it features strong performances by Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the rest of the cast. Nyong\u2019o voices Roz, a robot that was left behind on a deserted island by accident.\nRoz may not have been built for the wild, but she takes to it. She even makes friends with some of the animals and takes it upon herself to raise an orphaned goose named Brightbill (Kit Connor). Roz wouldn\u2019t go back to her old life if she could, but she may not have a choice when another robot, Vontra (Stephanie Hsu), comes to collect her.\nSmile (2022)\nSmile surprised everyone when it vastly outperformed expectations in theaters and became a breakout horror hit. That\u2019s pretty good for a movie that almost went straight to Paramount+. Writer and director Parker Finn continued the story from his short film, Laura Hasn\u2019t Slept, and put the scares on a larger scale. Laura Weaver (Caitlin Stasey) only has a small role in the film, but her death is the catalyst for everything that happens to Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon), a therapist who tried to treat Laura.\nRose didn\u2019t believe Laura was cursed, and even witnessing her horrific suicide didn\u2019t confirm anything supernatural. But seeing Laura\u2019s death is all it took for the curse to pass to Rose. Now she sees people flashing sinister smiles at her everywhere she goes. By the time Rose realizes that she really is cursed, it may be far too late to save herself.\nPaddington in Peru (2024)\nIt\u2019s been far too long between Paddington Bear movies, so much so that the entire Brown family had to be recast for Paddington in Peru. After living in London with the Brown family, Paddington (Ben Whishaw) receives a letter informing him that his aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) misses him and that she has been acting strangely.\nHenry (Hugh Bonneville) and Mary Brown (Emily Mortimer), along with their children, accompany Paddington back to Peru. Upon their arrival, they discover that Lucy has gone missing under suspicious circumstances. To find her, Paddington and the Browns will have to venture into the jungles of Peru and solve a mystery along the way.\nHeart Eyes (2025)\nThere have been horror films with romance before, but it\u2019s hard to think of another rom-com horror movie like Heart Eyes. The title character is a serial killer whose personalized touches include murdering couples and wearing the ridiculous heart-eye mask.\nIn theory, Ally McCabe (Olivia Holt) shouldn\u2019t have to worry about getting murdered by Heart Eyes. She just broke up with her boyfriend. But she has the bad fortune to catch Heart Eyes\u2019 attention when she goes out to dinner with a co-worker named Jay Simmons (Mason Gooding). Heart Eyes mistakes the pair as a couple and makes it his mission to murder both of them. In the process, Jay is framed for Heart Eyes\u2019 crimes and the killer is far from done with this pair.\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024)\nThey say you never forget your first love, and that may be why Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) is still lusting over Lydia Deetz (Winona Ryder) 36 years after they last met. Not that Lydia would ever call what she had with that creep \u201clove.\u201d She only agreed to marry him to save her dead friends.\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice begins with Lydia as the widowed mother of Astrid Deetz (Jenna Ortega) and addicted to pills that dull the power of her ability to see ghosts. Astrid believes her mother\u2019s a charlatan until she gets a glimpse of the supernatural when they visit Lydia\u2019s childhood home. Before long, Astrid\u2019s stuck in the afterlife, and Lydia has to reunite with Beetlejuice to rescue her daughter. And Beetlejuice will only help Lydia if she agrees to marry him. Unfortunately for Beetlejuice, his first ex-wife, Delores LaFerve (Monica Bellucci), has escaped confinement, and he\u2019s at the top of her hit list.\nHavoc (2025)\nCharlie (Justin Cornwell) and Mia (Quelin Sepulveda) are a pair of thieves who are in serious trouble in Havoc. While trying to pay off a debt Mia owes to a local Triad boss, she and Charlie are thrust into a coup for control of the gang that sends them on the run and accuses them of murder.\nLawrence Beaumont (Forest Whitaker), a very wealthy businessman running for mayor, is Charlie\u2019s father, and he has a vested interest in keeping his son safe. Beaumont also has a cop, Patrick Walker (Tom Hardy), on his payroll with explicit instructions to find and protect Charlie at all costs. That won\u2019t be easy as the Triads and the police pursue Charlie and Mia wherever they hide.\nThe Hating Game (2021)\nLucy Hale plays the similarly named Lucy Hutton in The Hating Game, and she\u2019s really got her rom-com persona down. Thanks to a corporate merger, Lucy is the new co-worker of Josh Templeman (Austin Stowell), her counterpart from another publisher. And they decide pretty quickly that they don\u2019t like each other and don\u2019t want to work together.\nTheir rivalry comes to a head in the form of a bet. They both go out for a promotion and whoever loses has to quit the company. Lucy is pretty sure she will win, but less sure how she feels about Josh after they develop a mutual attraction. Is their potential relationship real or just a ploy for a job?\nTalk to Me (2023)\nWelcome to the supernatural high of the season. For most reasonable people, playing around with an embalmed hand that lets spirits of the deceased enter into your body may seem like a bad idea for an evening\u2019s entertainment. But horror movies like Talk to Me are filled with people who have bad ideas, but usually not for long.\nA group of friends have been using the hand to consort with spirits because they feel a high when the ghosts leave their bodies. This is done with the understanding that the connection has to be broken in 90 seconds or else the spirits will take over their bodies. It\u2019s all fun and games until Mia (Sophie Wilde) won\u2019t let her best friend\u2019s younger brother, Riley (Joe Bird), break the connection in time. The consequences for that decision will be severe.\nDespicable Me 4 (2024)\nAs a villain, Gru (Steve Carell) was never quite evil enough to be truly despicable. By the time of Despicable Me 4, Gru has a wife, Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig), three loving adoptive daughters, and a son, Gru Jr. (Tara Strong), who doesn\u2019t seem to like his father very much.\nWhile attending his high school reunion, Gru runs afoul of his old nemesis, Maxime Le Mal (Will Ferrell), who decides that he\u2019s overdue for revenge. To protect their family, Gru and Lucy go undercover with their children in another town. Unfortunately for them, Gru\u2019s reputation as a former bad guy precedes him, and it won\u2019t be long before Maxime and his killer girlfriend, Valentina (Sof\u00eda Vergara), track them down.\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023)\nThe most recent live-action adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons is a surprisingly accessible story, thanks largely to a streamlined story centered on Chris Pine\u2019s charming rogue thief, Edgin Darvis. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves opens with Edgin escaping from prison alongside his best friend, Holga Kilgor (Michelle Rodriguez), simply because they want to reunite with Edgin\u2019s young daughter, Kira (Chloe Coleman).\nEdgin and Holga also suspect that their former partner, Forge Fitzwilliam (Hugh Grant), won\u2019t live up to the promises he made them. When they realize the full extent of Forge\u2019s deception, Edgin and Holga recruit a would-be sorcerer, Simon Aumar (Justice Smith), and his shape-changer ex, Doric (Sophia Lillis), to rob Forge\u2019s vaults and reclaim custody of Kira. In the process, they may have to save the entire realm from the plans of an evil red wizard.\nSaturday Night (2024)\nSaturday Night Live gets an origin story in Saturday Night, a fictionalization of the final 90 minutes before the taping of the first SNL episode in 1975. Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle) is the man who has to keep it all together in these critical minutes, even though it\u2019s clear that NBC has no faith in his ability to deliver the show that he promised.\nFuture comedy legends Chevy Chase (Cory Michael Smith), John Belushi (Matt Wood), Gilda Radner (Ella Hunt), Dan Aykroyd (Dylan O\u2019Brien), and more have their own drama. This grand comedy experiment could have fallen apart at any time, and it may take a miracle to get everyone on the same page.\nBack in Action (2025)\nThe title of Back in Action is fitting since it marks Cameron Diaz\u2019s return from retirement and Jamie Foxx\u2019s first movie since he suffered a debilitating stroke. Diaz and Foxx have also shared the screen two times before in Any Given Sunday and a remake of Annie, but this time, they play secret agents Emily and Matt. After a close call 15 years ago, Matt and Emily faked their deaths and started a family.\nIn the present, Emily and Matt have two children, Alice (McKenna Roberts) and Leo (Rylan Jackson), who have no idea that their parents used to be spies. After the couple accidentally goes viral, it reveals their survival to their old enemy, Balthazar Gor (Robert Besta). And Gor isn\u2019t willing to simply let bygones be bygones as he goes after their family with his heavily armed men.\nWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl (2024)\nIt\u2019s refreshing that even two decades after the last Wallace & Gromit movie, their latest stop-motion animated film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, looks and feels very much like its own thing. That gives it a timeless quality as well. The new story finds Wallace (Ben Whitehead) and his loyal canine friend, Gromit, in a pickle, largely of Wallace\u2019s own making.\nWallace has invented a smart gnome he calls Norbot (Reece Shearsmith), which can perform chores and be helpful around the house. The duo\u2019s old enemy, Feathers McGraw, hacks into Norbot and uses him to create a gnome army under his control. And if Wallace and Gromit can\u2019t thwart this plan, then their proverbial gooses are cooked.\nThe Six Triple Eight (2024)\nDid you know that there really was a battalion of all-Black women during World War II? The story of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion could have been lost to time if not for Kevin M. Hymel\u2019s 2019 article in WWII History Magazine, which has been adapted here by Tyler Perry, who wrote and directed The Six Triple Eight.\nFollowing the loss of someone close to her during the war, Lena Derriecott King (Ebony Obsidian) signs up for the war and finds herself in a unit commanded by Major Charity Adams (Kerry Washington). The women of the 6888 want to do more than just stay on the home front. However, their only mission in Europe involves untangling a staggering amount of mail between the soldiers on the front lines and their families. Lena eventually realizes this is important to the war effort, even as the women face the daunting task ahead of them.\nIt Ends with Us (2024)\nIt Ends with Us is based on the bes-selling book by Colleen Hoover, and its behind-the-scenes drama between stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni almost overshadowed the success of the movie itself. Lively plays Lily Bloom, a woman who meets and becomes infatuated with a surgeon, Ryle Kincaid (Baldoni).\nTheir fairy tale romance turns for the worse when Lily discovers that Ryle is an abusive lover. Ryle becomes very jealous upon learning about Lily\u2019s renewed connection with her old boyfriend, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar). Lily has genuine feelings for both men, but feels trapped in the same cycle of violence that doomed her parents\u2019 relationship.\nCarry-On (2024)\nLike Die Hard 2, Carry-On is an action thriller set on Christmas Eve in a busy airport. Unfortunately for TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton), his promotion came on the wrong day at the wrong time. An enigmatic traveler (Jason Bateman) wants Ethan to wave a package through uncontested. If Ethan refuses, then his girlfriend, Nora Parisi (Sofia Carson), will be killed.\nEthan\u2019s back is to the proverbial wall, and if he can\u2019t find a way to thwart the plan, then Nora may not be the only casualty. He needs a way to save Nora, and his options are running out fast.\nKung Fu Panda 4 (2024)\nSometimes the student must become the teacher. Kung Fu Panda 4 finds Po (Jack Black) at a crossroads in his life. For years, he\u2019s been the Dragon Warrior and the protector of the Valley of Peace. But now, Po is being called upon to pass his mantle on to a younger warrior and take on a more spiritual role.\nThe truth is that Po doesn\u2019t want to change anything, and he\u2019s also preoccupied by the arrival of The Chameleon (Viola Davis), a sorceress who may be the greatest threat he\u2019s ever faced. When Po goes to confront her, he\u2019s joined by Zhen (Awkwafina), a thieving fox who might be Dragon Warrior material. That\u2019s assuming, of course, that this fox isn\u2019t a snake in the grass.\nWoman of the Hour (2024)\nAnna Kendrick is making her directorial debut with Woman of the Hour, a film in which she also stars. The premise of this movie is off-the-wall bonkers and yet based on a true story. Kendrick plays Cheryl Bradshaw, a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978. That TV romance game show also featured a serial killer named Rodney Alcala (Daniel Zovatto) as one of the men vying for Cheryl\u2019s favor on the episode in question.\nNo one on The Dating Game could have guessed that Rodney was a murderer, but there\u2019s something very clearly off about him. It\u2019s a bizarre chapter in TV history now immortalized in this film.\nBad Boys: Ride or Die (2024)\nFor their fourth time out as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence sent their respective characters on the run in Bad Boys: Ride or Die. In the last movie, Mike and Marcus lost their captain, Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano), to an assassination. Now, Captain Howard\u2019s name is getting dragged through the mud after he\u2019s posthumously framed for crimes he didn\u2019t commit.\nWhen Mike and Marcus attempt to clear Howard of these charges, they find themselves framed, too. Once they\u2019re on the wrong side of the law, the guys learn who their friends really are. The rest of the Miami PD is gunning for them, and they\u2019re running out of options fast.\nRebel Ridge (2024)\nAaron Pierre establishes himself as an action hero in the Netflix original film Rebel Ridge. Terry Richmond (Pierre) only wanted to come into town and bail out his cousin, Mike Simmons (C.J. LeBlanc), so they could rebuild their lives together. But when corrupt cops seize Terry\u2019s cash, it leaves him without any way to get Mike out of jail.\nTerry tries to be reasonable with Chief Sandy Burnne (Don Johnson), only for these dishonorable men to go back on their word and keep his stolen money while Mike suffers. Now, Terry has to take the law into his own hands to get justice, and not even dirty cops can stand in his way.\nThe Union (2024)\nMike McKenna (Flight Risk\u2018s Mark Wahlberg) never really expected to see his high school sweetheart, Roxanne Hall (Halle Berry), ever again. But their paths converge in the action comedy called The Union because Roxanne needs someone she can trust. During the last two decades, Roxanne has become a secret agent of immeasurable skill, but most of her colleagues have been killed after their identities were exposed.\nRoxanne gives Mike a chance to become a spy because she knows she can rely on him. Compared to Roxanne, Mike is really winging it as their mission takes them all over Europe. But there may just be something left in their romantic connection if they can both make it home alive.\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024)\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F puts Eddie Murphy back into the title role for the first time since 1994. Axel Foley is a Detroit cop who has barged into Beverly Hills\u2019 jurisdiction on a case three times before. And Beverly Hills Police Captain Cade Grant (Kevin Bacon) is really upset that Axel is at it again.\nAxel doesn\u2019t care about the consequences because this is personal. Someone is targeting his adult daughter, Jane Saunders (Taylour Paige), and only her ex-boyfriend, Detective Bobby Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is willing to help Axel save her. However, Axel may still have some other friends left in the police department, and he\u2019ll need them when everything comes crashing down on him.\nHit Man (2024)\nRichard Linklater\u2019s Hit Man could have scored a full theatrical release in part because Glen Powell is one of the breakout stars of 2024. But instead, it\u2019s now a Netflix original that was co-written by both Powell and Linklater. The former is headlining the film as Gary Johnson, a man who has found his calling as an undercover operative for the police.\nGary pretends to be an assassin, and he helps the police arrest his would-be clients. It\u2019s a good racket for Gary until he meets Maddy Masters (Adria Arjona), a woman who wants her husband killed so she can escape his physical abuse. Maddy is the first \u201cclient\u201d that Gary has ever been real with, and he doesn\u2019t want to see her get arrested like his other marks. As much as Gary might try to believe otherwise, helping Maddy and getting emotionally involved with her may bring his life crashing down around him.\nGodzilla Minus One (2023)\nThere is an English dub of Godzilla Minus One on Netflix, but the original Japanese voice track has better performances. This is one of the best Godzilla movies ever made in part because the creature is allowed to be a fearsome monster instead of a heroic giant. It\u2019s also notable for featuring a strong focus on the human side of the story, especially with the main character K\u014dichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki).\nIn the last days of World War II, Shikishima can\u2019t bring himself to fulfill his duty as a kamikaze pilot. A chance encounter with Godzilla only brings more shame upon Shikishima. During the aftermath of the war, Shikishima forms an unexpected bond with Noriko \u014cishi (Minami Hamabe) and the infant child she adopted. Yet Shikishima\u2019s inability to let go of his regret may destroy him before Godzilla can get around to killing him and everyone else in Japan.\nAnyone But You (2023)\nAnyone but You is one of the rare rom-coms to become a smash hit, while also solidifying Sydney Sweeney as a star \u2026 and keeping her out of movie jail for co-starring in Madame Web. Sweeney plays Bea, a young woman who forms an instant connection with a guy named Ben (Twisters star Glen Powell). But after a great first date, things end very badly and they both blame each other.\nBea and Ben are unwillingly drawn back into each other\u2019s orbit at the wedding for Halle (Hadley Robinson) and Claudia (Alexandra Shipp). Despite being unhappy about their reunion, Bea and Ben also have their own reasons to make the other guests believe that they\u2019re a couple. And then the sparks start to fly between them again.\nThe Wages of Fear (2024)\nIn 1953, Georges Arnaud\u2019s The Wages of Fear was brought to the big screen by director Henri-Georges Clouzot who turned it into arguably one of the greatest action thrillers ever made. Director Julien Leclercq has a lot to live up to with the modern remake, which is a Netflix exclusive.\nThe names and faces may be different, but the story remains largely unchanged from the original. An oil fire is out of control, and the only way to put it out and save lives is with controlled explosions using nitroglycerin. Franck Gastambide, Alban Lenoir, Ana Girardot, and Sofiane Zermani play a group of disparate and desperate individuals who agree to transport the nitroglycerin across hundreds of miles of dangerous terrain. At the end of their journey is a payday that could change their lives forever, assuming they live long enough to get paid.\nYour Lucky Day (2023)\nWinning the lottery should be one the best days in anyone\u2019s life. But in Your Lucky Day, Sterling (Angus Cloud) didn\u2019t actually win. He killed someone to get his hands on the winning ticket, and he left witnesses: Amir (Mousa Hussein Kraish), Abraham (Elliot Knight), and his girlfriend, Ana-Marlene (Jessica Garza).\nNot even Sterling can kill that many people in cold blood, which is why he tries to bargain with them. He\u2019ll share some of the money from the ticket if they help him hide his crime. This plan has multiple problems, but Sterling\u2019s hostages and would-be accomplices simply can\u2019t deter him from this course of action. He\u2019s going to get this lottery money if it\u2019s the last thing he does \u2014 and it might be.\nOrion and the Dark (2024)\nAlmost everyone is afraid of the dark when they\u2019re a kid. The problem with Orion (Jacob Tremblay) is that he\u2019s scared of everything, not just the dark. The animated adventure, Orion and the Dark, gives Orion a chance to conquer his fears alongside an unexpected companion: The living embodiment of Dark (Paul Walter Hauser).\nRather than let this kid lose years of his life to a laundry list of fears, Dark takes Orion out for a wild night to prove that he doesn\u2019t have to be defined by the things that he\u2019s afraid about. It\u2019s a gesture of friendship from Dark, but can Orion finally let go of his phobias and embrace life?\nThe Killer (2023)\nDavid Fincher\u2019s latest thriller, The Killer, shows us that the life of a professional assassin, as played by Michael Fassbender, can be pretty mundane and boring \u2026 right up until he accidentally misses his target. From that point on, the assassin\u2019s life is anything but boring. And suddenly, even his contact, Hodges (Charles Parnell), is ghosting him.\nNot even fleeing the country is enough for the assassin to evade an international manhunt, as well as two rival assassins, The Expert (Tilda Swinton) and The Brute (Sala Baker), who have been hired to take him out."

      "text": "After a crackling start, Jeremy Saulnier\u2019s Rebel Ridge, Netflix\u2019s latest original hit, falters. Its director doesn\u2019t seem sure what kind of movie it should be, or how realistically it should present the consequences of unjust policing. This uncertainty compromises its effectiveness both as an entertainment and as a work of social consciousness.\nThe movie stars Aaron Pierre as Terry Richmond, a former nonlethal combat trainer for the U.S. Marine Corps. As the film opens, Terry is biking to Shelby Springs, Louisiana, with $36,000 in cash to bail out his cousin from the local jail. When cops detain him on false pretenses, Terry does everything he knows he\u2019s supposed to do as a Black man to avoid police brutality. He\u2019s polite, calm, patient, and respectful. The cops let him go, but they seize his money, supposedly because they believe it\u2019s illicit, but really because they are little more than shakedown artists with badges.\nNote: This article contains spoilers for Rebel Ridge and other films.\nThe movie starts out as intensely political\nThe opening scenes dramatize two major issues with American law enforcement: What Black people face at the hands of (mostly) white policemen in America. And the very real issue of civil asset forfeiture, where law enforcement can seize private property on the suspicion that it\u2019s illicit, without ever arresting or charging the owner \u2014 and never return it. It\u2019s a provocative start for a mainstream action movie to engage these polarizing hot-button issues with this degree of realism.\nTerry needs his money back badly. His cousin is due to be transferred to the local prison for holding in a few days, where Terry fears he will be killed by the mob while in custody. He goes to the police station and asks for just enough returned to him to pay the bail. Though the local police chief (Don Johnson in vintage form, channeling every racist small-town cop in the history of the movies) insults and threatens him, Terry is able to make a deal to spring his cousin. Things go from bad to worse when he returns the next morning to discover that the chief has betrayed him. Before long, the cousin is killed.\nRebel Ridge isn\u2019t Rambo\nWith the tension near boiling, it seems like a foregone conclusion that the movie will enter the familiar territory of First Blood and similar films where the wronged veteran takes on the small-town cops in a private war. The irony of First Blood, of course, is that John Rambo kills his countrymen with the skills he\u2019s acquired to defend them. Rambo became so associated with Reagan-era values that it\u2019s easy to forget he was initially a long-haired drifter resisting the lawmen who would trample the rights he sacrificed so much to protect.\nTerry finds himself in a similar situation when his status as a distinguished former Marine affords him little respect. With the viewer\u2019s sense of outrage piqued by the police corruption, they are primed to live vicariously through a bloody tale of justifiable revenge. It\u2019s the sort of dramatic situation that can get viewers questioning how much violence they are willing to tolerate in the face of injustice.\nParallels with Saulnier\u2019s other films\nAnother reason it seems as though Saulnier will embrace blood-drenched retribution is because he\u2019s done so in his past movies: the effective micro-budget revenge thriller Blue Ruin (also featuring an excellent Don Johnson performance), Hold the Dark, and Green Room.\nGreen Room, about a punk band targeted by Oregon skinheads after they witness a murder, is a freak show of gore and sadism. It\u2019s horrifying, yet brilliantly well-made \u2014 on par with a chilling masterwork like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Both movies unflinchingly present the worst of humanity from a sociological remove, feeling no need to offer commentary.\nHold the Dark, which stars Jeffrey Wright as a wolf expert who travels to Alaska to help solve a mystery, is not quite as visceral as Green Room (few films are). But it also features graphic violence, as well as a bloody shootout between locals and rural law enforcement (the cops are the good guys in this one). The shootout, in which a dozen cops are torn to shreds by an M-60, is as well-staged as any since the famous bank robbery gunfight in Heat, and the carnage is even more brutal.\nDespite this onscreen history \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 Saulnier has said in interviews he wanted to make a movie less driven by killing than his previous films. Terry, therefore, is no cop killer. He specializes in no-lethal combat, disabling his opponents with martial arts, bean bag cannons, tear gas, etc. It\u2019s commendable that Terry refuses to kill, though it does seem to soften the film a bit. If this is Saulnier\u2019s strategy to get the viewer to consider their own desire for onscreen bloodlust, then he\u2019s successful, but it blunts the impact of the film\u2019s overall message.\nIll-fitting genres\nInstead of fleeing to the woods to drop from trees onto the heads of his enemy (Roger Ebert joked that Rambo always seems to know exactly which tree the villain will stop underneath), Rebel Ridge\u2018s Terry enters into a partnership with a court clerk (AnnaSophia Robb), and together they peel back the layers of corruption in local law enforcement, showing how the entire town is funded by civil asset forfeiture. The middle acts attempt to weave the labyrinth mystery plot of a movie like L.A. Confidential. Perhaps as a nod to Curtis Hanson\u2019s 1997 masterpiece, James Cromwell, who played the corrupt police captain in that film, even appears as a compromised judge in Rebel Ridge.\nIt\u2019s an uneasy alliance of genres, but this approach has precedence in Saulnier\u2019s work. Hold the Dark is also a genre mash-up: crime thriller, supernatural mystery, and wilderness adventure film, with bits of Iraq War movie thrown in for good measure. Like Rebel Ridge, it\u2019s compelling, even gripping, for long stretches. Also, like Rebel Ridge, never quite coalescing around one genre compromises its effectiveness.\nThe mystery unfolding at the center or Rebel Ridge also drags down the pace. The charged tension of the opening act prevents the viewer from asking obvious questions about the plot, like where is Terry riding his bike all the way from? Wouldn\u2019t a rental car have made more sense given the distance he has to travel? If he\u2019s had a brilliant career as a Marine combat trainer, why is he now trying to save his pennies working at a Chinese restaurant? The owner of the restaurant, while patching up Terry\u2019s gunshot wound, is revealed to have been a medic during the Korean War. But wouldn\u2019t that make him something like 95 years old?\nThe shift to investigative story not only slackens the tension and diverts the viewer\u2019s attention with such questions, it undercuts the earlier realism that has made the racist policing and civil asset forfeiture feel so urgent and awful.\nThis begs the question of how political should a movie like this be? Netflix feature productions aren\u2019t exactly known for their social consciousness or political provocation, though Saulnier has said he wrote the screenplay with Tony Gilroy\u2019s 2007 movie, Michael Clayton, in mind. But few films balance thriller elements with social/political commentary as deftly as that film does, and it\u2019s a feat Gilroy pulled off again with the first season of Andor (he\u2019s really good at it). Rebel Ridge leans into the politics, but not far enough, or with the right balance, to be the blisteringly realistic takedown of social ills it starts out as.\nThe ending doesn\u2019t add up\nThe ending is a big letdown, not only because it fails to honor the maverick spirt seen in the beginning, but because it also seems like a direct rebuke of Saulnier\u2019s earlier work. The survivors in Green Room are happy to kill the people that killed their friends. There is no theme that violence can lead to empathy or destroy one\u2019s soul. In Hold the Dark, the killers escape unpunished into the wilderness, literally leaving the hero to the wolves.\nRebel Ridge, in contrast, takes a last-minute turn that can almost be described as Pollyannaish, as the villainous cops suddenly decide to help save the heroes just as all seems lost. Small town Southern cops are too often presented as one-dimensional racist yokels in movies (for a complex portrait of a small town Southern cop, check out Carl Franklin\u2019s 1992 masterpiece One False Move), and it\u2019s appealing that the basic goodness of some of them is affirmed here. But this twist is not set up in a way that\u2019s convincing. It leads to a last scene that is ambivalent at best, confusing at worst.\nGreen Room is as punk rock as the group at its center. It never flinches, gets in and out fast, and delivers its energy in one sustained burst. Rebel Ridge is more like a double album by a successful band given over to its own excesses. There are some great tracks for sure, but a lot of filler. Saulnier is at his best when he doesn\u2019t pull any punches with his material, and when he picks a genre and sticks to it.\nRebel Ridge is streaming on Netflix."

      "text": "Prime Video\u2019s audience loves their favorite accountant. Ben Affleck reprised his role as the brilliant Christian Wolff earlier this year in The Accountant 2. After the action thriller\u2019s theatrical run, The Accountant premiered on Prime Video in early June. The movie nearly reached 80 million worldwide viewers on Prime Video, making it Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 second most-watched film of all time.\nLike many streaming services, Prime Video has a top 10 for the most popular films on the service. One of the selections, Wicked, is an excellent movie to watch this month. Read this guide for recommendations on what to stream on Prime Video.\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\n-\nThe Fire InsidePG-13 2024\n-\nHomefrontR 2013\n-\nMission: Impossible - Dead ReckoningPG-13 2023\nThe Accountant 2 (2025)\nOne of the world\u2019s most brilliant minds, who moonlights as a vigilante, returns for a sequel in The Accountant 2. Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an accountant for some of the world\u2019s most nefarious criminals. When the body of Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) is found with \u201cfind the accountant\u201d on his arm, U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) asks Christian to help find the killer.\nKing was trying to track down a Salvadoran family and went to an assassin for help. Christian can\u2019t do this job alone, so he recruits his mercenary brother Brax (Jon Bernthal) as backup. The ensuing investigation leads to an organization of killers who will do anything to keep their secrets buried. Unfortunately for this criminal ring, they are going up against two highly skilled soldiers in Christian and Brax.\nWicked (2024)\nThe Tony Award-winning stage musical finally received its long-awaited feature film adaptation. Directed by Jon M. Chu, Wicked follows the lives of Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), a green-skinned introvert, and Galinda (Ariana Grande), the bubbly social butterfly. These two opposites form an unlikely friendship at Shiz University in the Land of Oz.\nAfter a tumultuous meeting with the Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum), the two women go down different paths, as Elphaba becomes the Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda assumes the mantle of Glinda the Good. Wicked is the first of a two-part adaptation. Part two, Wicked: For Good, premieres later in 2025.\nMoneyball (2011)\nHow can you not be romantic about baseball? In a career-defining performance, Brad Pitt plays a general manager looking to shake things up in Moneyball. Oakland A\u2019s general manager Billy Beane (Pitt) faces an uncertain offseason. His three best players are set to depart in free agency, and the team\u2019s owner does not want to overspend for players. Forced to sign players on a tight budget, Billy transforms his entire philosophy as a baseball evaluator.\nWith the help of the Ivy League-educated Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), Bill starts searching for underutilized and undervalued players to build his roster for the 2002 season. This sabermetric approach revolutionized the game of baseball. Who knew a bunch of guys talking in a room about baseball could be so riveting?\nThe Fire Inside (2024)\nThe Fire Inside is based on the true story of Olympic gold medalist, Claressa \u201cT-Rex\u201d Shields (Ryan Destiny), the first American woman to do so in boxing\u2026 twice. That\u2019s not a spoiler for the movie, because Claressa\u2019s Olympic triumph isn\u2019t the ultimate destination, it\u2019s just a stop along the way. The film movingly conveys Claressa\u2019s connection with her coach, Jason Crutchfield (Bryan Tyree Henry), and there\u2019s an understated bond between them. As much as Claressa has to fight her battles in the ring, she\u2019s got a lot of struggles in her daily life as well. Winning Olympic gold hasn\u2019t given Claressa the access to endorsements or lucrative deals that could pull her up to another level. All she ultimately has is her faith in herself and the support of the people closest to her.\nHomefront (2013)\nJason Statham doesn\u2019t always get surrounded by a strong supporting cast in his action flicks, but he\u2019s got a good lineup of colleagues with him in Homefront. Statham plays Phil Broker, a former DEA agent who has retired to raise his daughter, Maddy Broker (Izabela Vidovic), in peace.\nThat peace doesn\u2019t last long as Phil runs afoul of Cassie Bodine (Kate Bosworth), the mother of one of Maddy\u2019s classmates. Cassie enlist her brother, Morgan \u201cGator\u201d Bodine (James Franco), to get Phil out of the way. And through Gator, Phil\u2019s location is leaked to some of the most dangerous men he put away in the DEA.\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023)\nEthan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Grace (Hayley Atwell) have a meet-cute in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning that\u2019s worthy of any rom-com. They might have even had a romantic spark if she wasn\u2019t trying to steal something he needs to save the world. Regardless, Ethan and Grace spend a lot of time joined at the wrist \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 because Ethan\u2019s racing against time to stop an AI known as The Entity.\nThis time, even the U.S. government doesn\u2019t want Ethan and his team to succeed, because if America can control The Entity then it will control the future. All of the other countries have the same mentality, but The Entity is the one really in control. And its reach extends to the real world, where it forces Ethan to make life-and-death decisions. He knows The Entity needs to be destroyed, but it may already be too late for that.\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)\nShia LaBeouf has one of his most moving performances in The Peanut Butter Falcon, which casts him as a crab catcher named Tyler. After literally burning his bridges with his former colleagues, Tyler hides out in the wilderness for their retribution. That\u2019s where he meets Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down syndrome who is also on the run after escaping a facility.\nZak and Tyler emotionally bond, and they decide to stick together to help the former achieve his dream of learning how to wrestle under the legendary Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church). Eleanor (Dakota Johnson), the woman in charge of Zak\u2019s medical care, pursues the duo because she truly cares about Zak\u2019s well-being. And when she sees how well Zak and Tyler are together, she has to question whether bringing Zak home is the right move.\nAnother Simple Favor (2025)\nAfter the events of A Simple Favor, Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) would have to be crazy to have anything to do with Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) ever again. Crazy or desperate. Stephanie\u2019s blip of fame since sending Emily to prison is largely burned out in Another Simple Favor. When Emily is released from prison and invites Stephanie to her destination wedding in Italy, she reluctantly accepts.\nStephanie isn\u2019t the only one from Emily\u2019s old life invited to the wedding. Emily\u2019s ex-husband, Sean Townsend (Henry Golding), and her mother, Margaret McLanden (Elizabeth Perkins), also made the trip. Regardless, Stephanie is expecting a double cross from Emily. And she\u2019s right to be suspicious, but the dangerous twist won\u2019t necessarily come the way she expects.\nConclave (2024)\nThe pope is dead in Conclave, meaning his successor must be chosen. Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), the dean of the College of Cardinals, will oversee the election of the next pope. And it\u2019s more than just a choice between the four major candidates. Whoever is chosen will shape the future of the Catholic Church itself.\nThe election may take place behind closed doors in Vatican City, but the secrets that emerge could end the careers of some and potentially spark more scandal in the church. There\u2019s a surprising amount of intrigue in the selection process, and the film also boasts a stellar supporting cast that includes Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini.\nGladiator II (2024)\nIt only took 24 years for a sequel to Gladiator to reach theaters. Russell Crowe\u2019s character remains dead, but Lucius Verus Aurelius (Paul Mescal) carries on the tradition of losing his family and being sold into slavery in Gladiator II. Connie Nielsen reprises her role as Lucilla from the first film, and she was the one who sent Lucius away for his own safety.\nIn Lucius\u2019 absence, Rome is ruled by not one but two mad emperors: Geta (Joseph Quinn) and Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). As Lucius climbs the ranks of the gladiators, a former slave named Macrinus (Denzel Washington) wants to use him to get the emperors out of the way. But Lucius is his own man, like his father before him.\nG20 (2025)\nAction hero Presidents aren\u2019t a new thing, but Viola Davis\u2019 character in G20 might be the first female action hero president. As far as President Danielle Sutton (Davis) knew, this year\u2019s G20 summit in South Africa was supposed to be an ordinary meeting of leaders from across the globe.\nThe Boys\u2018 Antony Starr co-stars in the film as Rutledge, the leader of the terrorists who take the security team by surprise and capture the world leaders. President Sutton manages to get free. And if she wants to save her family and her fellow leaders, then she\u2019ll need to get her hands dirty and do it herself.\nVal (2021)\nEven years before Val Kilmer became a star in Hollywood, he kept home movies from his childhood to his teens and beyond. It was the story of Kilmer\u2019s life that no one had seen until directors Ting Poo and Leo Scott put it all together as Val.\nThis documentary is also a family affair for Kilmer, his ex-wife Joanne Whalley, and their children, Mercedes and Jack. Since Kilmer had lost his voice during his battle with throat cancer, Jack Kilmer stepped in to read the words written by his father as he looked back at everything he went through to become the man he wanted to be.\nHolland (2025)\nWhat\u2019s eating Nancy Vandergroot (Nicole Kidman) in Holland? She\u2019s got a great thing going in this small town with overtly Dutch roots. Nancy\u2019s got a fine husband, Fred Vandergroot (Matthew Macfadyen), and their son, Harry (Jude Hill), is unusually well-behaved.\nIt\u2019s so perfect that the slightest imperfection alerts Nancy that maybe things aren\u2019t so rosy after all. For an optometrist, Fred sure takes a lot of out-of-town trips. Nancy\u2019s pretty sure that means Fred\u2019s having an affair, and she turns to her new friend, Dave Delgado (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), to help her prove it. What they find isn\u2019t what Nancy expected, which turns her world upside down.\nTransformers One (2024)\nTransformers One is the origin story of the franchise\u2019s leading hero and villain: Optimus Prime and Megatron. At this point in their history, Optimus is known as Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth), while the future Megatron is D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry). Both are miners on Cybertron, and good friends as well.\nAfter befriending B-127 (Keegan-Michael Key) and their former boss, Elita-1 (Scarlett Johansson), Orion and D-16 discover that Cybertron\u2019s ruler, Sentinal Prime (Jon Hamm), has betrayed the planet to their enemies. Orion and D-16 are both outraged by this revelation, but they aren\u2019t on the same page about how to handle it. That leads to the beginning of a rift between them that will have dire consequences for the future.\nTwisters (2024)\nThe new Superman, David Corenswet, has a small role in Twisters, which may be significant years down the line. But he\u2019s not the prime attraction here, and neither are Daisy Edgar-Jones or Glen Powell, the two topline stars who have top billing. Instead, it\u2019s the tornadoes themselves that are the stars of Twisters, especially when the film veers into cartoonish levels of destruction.\nYears ago, storm chaser Kate Carter (Edgar-Jones) had a radical idea that tornadoes could be potentially weakened through her experimental method. When the experiment fails, Kate and Javi (Anthony Ramos) are the only survivors from their team. In the present, Javi lures Kate out of retirement to retry her experiment. While back in the field, Kate encounters a YouTube storm chaser, Tyler Owens (Powell), whom she initially dislikes. When the chips are down and the winds are blowing, Kate will be glad to have Tyler on her side.\nThe Accountant (2016)\nThe Accountant 2 is coming very soon, so it\u2019s worth revisiting the original film ahead of time. Ben Affleck plays the unnamed title character in The Accountant, and he\u2019s the best criminal accountant that the underworld can buy. The Accountant\u2019s autism helps his mind crunch numbers and detect fraud inside criminal organizations. In other words, he can sniff out a rat who\u2019s stealing money from his fellow crooks.\nHis latest client is Living Robotics, after an internal client, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), uncovers startling irregularities in the company\u2019s records. Co-owner Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart) hired the Accountant to sort things out, but what he discovers is a deadly conspiracy that won\u2019t only target him. Dana will also become a target because she knows too much about the fraud.\nSmile 2 (2024)\nSmile 2 is an unusual sequel in that the events of the first film aren\u2019t really necessary to understand what\u2019s happening in this one. Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) has no idea who Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is or what happened to her in Smile, and the person who unintentionally connects them is a police officer named Joel (Kyle Gallner). Before long, Skye finds herself plagued by the same curse that afflicted Rose and Joel, and she doesn\u2019t know what to make of all of the creepy smiles she sees on everyone\u2019s faces.\nSkye isn\u2019t just some random woman; she\u2019s a pop star on the verge of even greater stardom. But the curse has a way of getting under its victims\u2019 skin and driving them insane. Skye is no exception, and as the curse stalks her wherever she goes, she rapidly loses the ability to tell what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\nPicture This (2025)\nBridgerton\u2018s Simone Ashley leads the cast of Picture This as Pia, a young woman struggling to keep her photography business afloat as her family prepares for the month-long build-up to the wedding of her younger sister, Sonal (Anoushka Chadha).\nDuring one of the wedding events, a spiritual advisor tells Pia that she will find the love and career success that she has always wanted somewhere in the next five dates that she goes on. Pia doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in that prediction, but the thought of it hangs over her head with every romantic encounter that she has. She also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend, Charlie (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), who is part of the wedding party on the groom\u2019s side. Seeing Charlie again makes Pia reexamine their relationship, and it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the prediction about her love life was wrong.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was such a massive hit both in theaters and on streaming that it\u2019s kind of redeemed everything that happened after the first Super Mario Bros. movie. Animation was clearly the way to go for this adaptation, as Mario (Chris Pratt), Luigi (Charlie Day), and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) look like they stepped out of a Nintendo Switch and into a breathtaking video game world.\nThe story serves as an origin for the Mario brothers, as they accidentally find themselves transported to the Mushroom Kingdom just as it\u2019s under attack by Bowser (Jack Black) and his army of Koopa Troopas. When Luigi gets captured by Bowser, Mario has to discover his inner hero alongside Peach and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) as they search for allies in their struggle.\nBlink Twice (2024)\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t have an on-screen role in Blink Twice, Zoe Kravitz made her directorial debut with this movie. Naomi Ackie headlines the cast as Frida, a young woman who scores an exclusive invitation from billionaire Slater King (Channing Tatum) to visit his private island alongside her best friend, Jess (Alia Shawkat).\nFrida and Jess are lavished with gifts and attention alongside the other female guests on the island. However, Frida notices that she\u2019s experiencing gaps in her memories. When Jess goes missing, Frida is the only one left who remembers her friend. There\u2019s something sinister going on, and this may not be Frida\u2019s first time on Slater\u2019s private island.\nIn the Land of Saints and Sinners (2023)\nLiam Neeson\u2019s action thrillers are kind of a dime a dozen, but In the Land of Saints and Sinners is one of his best. Neeson plays Finbar Murphy, a World War II veteran living in Ireland during \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in the \u201970s. To support himself, Finbar has started working for a crime boss, Robert McQue (Colm Meaney), as an assassin.\nFinbar also befriends a younger contract killer named Kevin (Game of Thrones\u2018 Jack Gleeson), but one of their mutual targets is the brother of Doireann McCann (Kerry Condon), a formidable woman who won\u2019t back down from her revenge. Doireann is determined to avenge her brother, no matter who she has to kill to do it.\nThe Fall Guy (2024)\nStunt man Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is burned out on Hollywood in The Fall Guy. It\u2019s hard to blame him after witnessing the injuries he suffers early in this movie. Unfortunately, Colt ruined his relationship with Jody Moreno (Emily Blunt) while he was torching his bridges to the entertainment industry. Nearly two years later, Colt reenters Jody\u2019s life when she\u2019s gotten the chance to direct her own movie.\nJody isn\u2019t exactly happy to see her ex again, but she needs her help. Her star, Tom Ryder (Kraven the Hunter\u2018s Aaron Taylor-Johnson), has gone missing, and this is more than just an actor on an extended bender. Without Tom, there is no movie to be made, and Jody\u2019s career will be over before it starts. Thus, Colt is drawn into a bigger mystery as he tries to locate Tom and make amends with Jody.\nA Quiet Place: Day One (2024)\nTypically, alien invasion movies involve humanity putting up a fight. But in A Quiet Place: Day One, the battle is over before it even begins, as humans can\u2019t withstand an attack by sightless alien hunters. Sam (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) witnessed the carnage herself while on a day out with her cat in the city.\nSam quickly realizes that her survival hinges on her ability to be quiet. Another survivor, Eric (The Fantastic Four: First Steps\u2018 Joseph Quinn), might be the last friend she ever makes. Sam and Eric must stick together if they want to escape New York City and evade the hunters now roaming the Earth.\nThe Bikeriders (2024)\nThe Bikeriders is loosely based upon the experiences of author Danny Lyon, a character portrayed by Mike Faist in this adaptation. But the film is largely reworked into an original story that focuses on three characters: Kathy (Jodie Comer), her lover, Benny (Austin Butler), and the leader of the Vandals Motorcycle Club, Johnny (Tom Hardy).\nJohnny had high-minded ideals when he founded the club in the 1960s. Over the course of the next decade, Johnny and his friends are almost unrecognizable in what they\u2019re willing to do for the club. Despite Benny\u2019s love for Kathy, he keeps getting drawn back into Johnny\u2019s vision for the club, even when it may destroy him.\nKnives Out (2019)\nDaniel Craig sheds his James Bond persona like a separate skin in Knives Out. Craig steps into the role of Southern sleuth Benoit Blanc, a man whose accent is just shy of Foghorn Leghorn territory. However, the voice somehow works for this comedic murder mystery. Ana de Armas has a standout turn as Marta Cabrera, the loyal housekeeper of a wealthy author, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).\nAfter Harlan dies, his spoiled extended family is stunned to discover that his entire fortune has been left to Marta. The family does not know that Harlan was murdered. Plus, Marta is horrified to discover that the evidence points back to her just as Blanc begins his investigation.\nAbigail (2024)\nScream\u2018s Melissa Barrera reunites with directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett for Abigail, a film that is very much unlike her previous genre movies. Barrera plays Joey, a military veteran who has hit hard times. That\u2019s why she agreed to work with Frank (Dan Stevens) and a group of other criminals to kidnap a young girl named Abigail (Alisha Weir).\nJoey tries to form a connection with Abigail to assure the young girl that she will remain safe before learning that the latter is the daughter of a dangerous crime lord, Kristof Lazaar (Matthew Goode). However, the greatest threat to the kidnappers is Abigail herself, because she\u2019s more than she appears to be. When Abigail strikes, it\u2019s lethal.\nCanary Black (2024)\nYou can tell that Canary Black has been on the shelf for a while since it has the late Ray Stevenson in one of his final roles. But it\u2019s also a showcase for Kate Beckinsale to get back into her action heroine mode, which she\u2019s been doing for about two decades now. Beckinsale plays Avery Graves, a CIA operative who has kept her husband, David Brooks (Rupert Friend), in the dark about who she really is and what her job entails.\nWhen terrorists kidnap David, they blackmail Avery into retrieving a file called Canary Black that could lead to an attack on her country. Stevenson plays Avery\u2019s mentor and boss, Jarvis Hedlund, and even he\u2019s not sure he can trust her when she goes rogue. But if Avery can\u2019t find a way out from under the terrorists\u2019 control, she may lose everything she holds dear.\nMonkey Man (2024)\nDev Patel made his directorial debut with Monkey Man, a film in which he also stars as the main character. And despite the title, Patel\u2019s character doesn\u2019t actually transform into a monkey or even go by that name. The audience only knows him as Kid, a man who will do anything to get his revenge on Rana Singh (Sikandar Kher), the corrupt police chief who murdered his mother.\nKid does wear a monkey mask when he\u2019s in the ring for an underground fighting circuit. However, his real disguise is pretending to be an ordinary waiter at a high-end brothel so he can rise through the ranks and get close enough to assassinate Rana no matter what his vengeance costs him.\nTerrifier 2 (2022)\nArt the Clown (David Howard Thornton) is back for another round of terror in Terrifier 2. Some evil entity has resurrected Art yet again, and he goes on another rampage. A teenager named Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) is haunted by dreams of Art and she\u2019s convinced that her late father knew how to stop the clown once and for all.\nArt must sense the same thing, since he kidnaps Sienna\u2019s brother, Jonathan (Elliott Fullam), and terrorizes their family. Now, Sienna has to save her brother, but first, she must live through her encounter with Art.\nChallengers (2024)\nYou may have to pay close attention to Challengers, because the story doesn\u2019t take place in chronological order. Zendaya stars as Tashi Duncan, a rising tennis star romantically drawn to two other players on the pro tour: Patrick Zweig (Josh O\u2019Connor) and Art Donaldson (Mike Faist).\nBoth young men want Tashi for themselves, but only one of them is willing to play dirty to get her. Even when one of them wins Tashi\u2019s heart, it doesn\u2019t end the romantic entanglement between this trio as their lives unfold and intersect over several years. Ultimately, the battle between these two men is going to come back to the place where it all began: on the tennis court.\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)\nIn the long wait between Shrek movies, Antonio Banderas\u2019 Puss in Boots has been keeping the franchise alive. But in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, time is almost up for the title character. Puss relies on his nine lives to survive the epic adventures. And now that Puss is on his very last life, he\u2019s truly scared about his potential fate \u2014 so much so that he abandons his identity and tries to live as a normal cat.\nHowever, Puss learns that there may be a way to restore his lost lives if he can find a magical wishing star. Puss isn\u2019t the only one looking for the star, nor the only one who desperately needs what it can offer him. This quest reunites Puss with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), and forces him to reevaluate what he really wants.\nSnack Shack (2024)\nSnack Shack is a coming-of-age comedy set in 1991. A.J. Carter (Conor Sherry) and his friend, Moose Miller (Gabriel LaBelle), are 14-year-olds whose schemes to get money almost always backfire on them. At least until they hit upon the idea of running the local Snack Shack for the summer.\nTheir bond of friendship is tested when A.J. meets Brooke, his attractive new neighbor. Because Moose makes the first move on Brooke, this creates tension between him and A.J., who isn\u2019t willing to simply back off. As Brooke begins to reciprocate A.J.\u2019s feelings, his friendship and lucrative partnership with Moose may come crashing down.\nBob Marley: One Love (2024)\nBob Marley: One Love is a music biopic that takes place late in the life of reggae superstar Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir). After Bob and his wife, Rita Marley (The Marvels actress Lashana Lynch), narrowly survive an assassination attempt in his native Jamaica, it sends him into a creative tailspin that threatens to derail his dreams.\nBefore Bob can resume his message of peace, he has to face his own inner demons and work out his issues with Rita. Bob Marley didn\u2019t have a lot of time in this world, but the film shows that he made the most of what he had and left a lasting legacy of music behind.\nAmerican Fiction (2023)\nAmerican Fiction casts The Batman Part Two\u2019s Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Thelonious \u201cMonk\u201d Ellison, a college professor and a novelist whose books sell very poorly. Monk is also upset that another writer, Sinatra Golden (Issa Rae), has found massive success while seemingly pandering to Black stereotypes. So Monk writes his own novel as a satire of Golden\u2019s books before submitting it for publication.\nMuch to Monk\u2019s surprise and horror, his satire is embraced by the publisher and the general public. The satire of the piece goes unnoticed, as the book becomes so popular that it starts taking over Monk\u2019s life, even though he made sure that his real name wasn\u2019t listed as the author. But once the book is out and Hollywood comes knocking, it may be too late.\nThe Idea of You (2024)\nThe irony of the premise of The Idea of You is that the romantic entanglement of Sol\u00e8ne Marchand (Eileen\u2018s Anne Hathaway) with boy band lead singer Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine) would probably be more of a fantasy for Sol\u00e8ne\u2019s daughter, Izzy (Ella Rubin), than for Sol\u00e8ne herself. But one unplanned encounter between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes soon leads to several others.\nThere is an age gap between Sol\u00e8ne and Hayes that does come up in the film, but the bigger issue between them is the celebrity gap. As long as Hayes is a world-famous musician, he and Sol\u00e8ne may never be able to enjoy a normal romance without being hounded by the press.\nRoad House (2024)\nIn this remake of the popular 1989 movie starring Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Elwood Dalton as a former UFC fighter who has fallen on some hard times. Road House gives Elwood a chance for redemption when Frankie (Jessica Williams) recruits him to be the bouncer at her bar, which shares its name with the title of the film.\nElwood\u2019s fighting skills go a long way towards keeping order at The Road House, much to the anger of a local mobster, Ben Brandt (Billy Magnussen). Elwood took care of Brandt\u2019s regular goons with ease, but he\u2019ll have a much harder time handling Knox, an enforcer for Brandt who is played by an actual UFC fighter, Conor McGregor.\nThe Other Zoey (2023)\nThe Other Zoey is not a remake of the Sandra Bullock rom-com While You Were Sleeping. But romantic comedy fans may notice some similarities between the two. Josephine Langford stars as Zoey Miller, a high school student who is definitely not the girlfriend of soccer star Zach MacLaren (Drew Starkey), whose girlfriend is also named Zoey (Maggie Thurmon).\nWhen Zach suffers a head injury that gives him partial amnesia, he mistakes Zoey for his girlfriend, and his doctors warn her not to upset him with the truth. So Zoey carries on the deception and gets closer to Zach on a lavish vacation. At the same time, Zoey also feels attracted to Zach\u2019s cousin, Miles Maclaren (Archie Renaux), who shares many of her views about love and life. So, which guy does Zoey really want? You\u2019ll have to watch the film to find out.\nRole Play (2023)\nEmma (The Flight Attendant\u2018s Kaley Cuoco) and Dave Brackett (David Oyelowo) are just about as happy as a couple could be in Prime Video\u2019s Role Play. The Bracketts have two children and a beautiful home in a New Jersey suburb. What they\u2019re lacking is the passion in the bedroom that they used to have before starting a family.\nFor their anniversary, Dave and Emma take a trip to New York and indulge in some role play. That turns out to be a mistake when Bob Kellerman (Bill Nighy) blows Emma\u2019s cover and exposes her as an international assassin. Now, Emma has to use her skills to protect her family and keep her marriage to Dave intact.\nTotally Killer (2023)\nAmazon Studios\u2019 Totally Killer seems to welcome comparisons to Back to the Future, and it\u2019s one of the more unique blends of sci-fi, comedy, and horror. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u2019s Kiernan Shipka stars as Jamie, a teenager who is very familiar with the story about how her mom, Pam (Julie Bowen), survived the Sweet Sixteen Killer 35 years ago. It\u2019s something that Jamie has heard about many times in her life.\nWhen the Sweet Sixteen Killer returns in the present, Jamie finds herself transported back in time to 1987, when her much younger mother (Olivia Holt) was apparently one of the mean girls in school. Yet if Jamie can\u2019t protect Pam in the past then she may not have a future to go home to."

      "text": "Celebrities, politicians, and regular Instagram users have fallen for yet another hoax claiming the social network has changed its rules to make \u201ceverything you\u2019ve ever posted\u201d public \u2014 including deleted posts. It\u2019s not real: There hasn\u2019t been any rule change and posting a picture of a big block of text wouldn\u2019t protect you if it did.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no truth to this post,\u201d Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Instagram owner Facebook, told Digital Trends in a statement.\nThe fraudulent post is similar to dozens of others that have also spread on Facebook and Twitter in recent years, claiming that \u201cChannel 13 News talked about the change in Instagram\u2019s privacy policy\u201d without posting the fraudulent text, \u201cyou will be tacitly allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in the profile status updates.\u201d\nThe image looks like someone took a similar block of text about Facebook and replaced the word \u201cFacebook\u201d with \u201cInstagram\u201d \u2014 every instance of \u201cInstagram\u201d is bolded and not level with the rest of the text. According to the fact-checkers at Lead Stories, which called the image \u201cfake news,\u201d that\u2019s exactly the case: The same image has been circulating on Facebook for years.\nDespite the obviously sketchy nature of the post, a surprisingly large amount of actors, musicians, and even politicians were duped by the scam. Rick Perry, the current U.S. Secretary of Energy and former Texas governor, posted the image, along with Rob Lowe, Usher, Julia Roberts, Judd Apatow, Taraji P. Henson, and Tom Holland.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B1Z8l28nzA8/\nEven Instagram head Adam Mosseri posted that the image and its claims were a complete hoax.\n\u201cHeads up!,\u201d Mosseri wrote on his Instagram story. \u201cIf you\u2019re seeing a meme claiming that Instagram is changing its rules tomorrow, it\u2019s not true.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s plenty to be concerned about when it comes to Instagram and Facebook\u2019s use of your images and data, posting a big block of legal-sounding text doesn\u2019t do anything to protect you.

      "text": "While Netflix and TV mean the same thing for some people, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that finding something worth your time is all that easy. If you\u2019ve ever found yourself scrolling through Netflix searching for just the right movie or show, then you know that the recommendations you get aren\u2019t necessarily always perfect.\nIn light of the limitations of the algorithm, we\u2019ve pulled together a list of three underrated shows that are all available on Netflix and all well worth your time. Take a look:\nWe also have guides to the best new movies to stream, the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on HBO Max, and the best movies on Disney+.\nOutlander (2014-)\nAlthough this show debuted to critical acclaim and has maintained a devoted fandom throughout its long run on the air, Outlander is no longer as beloved or popular as it once was. The series is romantic high fantasy and follows a woman living in the 1950s as she\u2019s transported 200 years into the past.\nShe finds herself torn between the husband she left behind and the new man she\u2019s falling for in the past. Breathtakingly romantic, Outlander is definitely a show about love and all of its many complications and dramas, but it\u2019s incredibly good at being that.\nYou can watch Outlander on Netflix.\nWet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (2015)\nThe 2001 film Wet Hot American Summer remains, in some ways, the ideal gonzo comedy of its era. Nothing in the movie makes much sense, and none of it really has to, in part because it features a cast filled with people who would go on to become major stars.\nFirst Day of Camp attempts to recapture the magic of that original film and succeeds to a larger extent than you might expect. Not every single joke lands, but as a vehicle for laughs, you could do a lot worse than this revival series, which managed to get even Paul Rudd to show up for a moment.\nYou can watch Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp on Netflix.\nChef\u2019s Table: BBQ (2020)\nA show that\u2019s guaranteed to make even the vegetarians amongst us hungry, Chef\u2019s Table: BBQ is a food travelogue that hones in on barbecue in all of its various forms and travels all around the world to sample them.\nWhile Netflix offers many excellent food documentaries, this season of Chef\u2019s Table uniquely enhances your appreciation for a type of cuisine that has been integral to most people\u2019s lives for years. Barbecue has plenty of long, beautiful traditions, and Chef\u2019s Table: BBQ shines a spotlight on all of them.\nYou can watch Chef\u2019s Table: BBQ on Netflix."
