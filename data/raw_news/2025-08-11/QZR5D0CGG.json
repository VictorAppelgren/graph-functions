  "content": "Monday.com Ltd. MNDY shares are volatile Monday after the company reported second-quarter 2025 results.\n\nWhat To Know: The software company posted revenue of $299 million, up 27% year over year, driven by strong demand from enterprise customers and growth in its customer base. The company also added a record number of net new customers generating over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR), while its monday CRM product reached $100 million in ARR just three years after launch.\n\nDespite the revenue growth, profitability metrics were mixed. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $45.1 million, up from $38.4 million a year ago, but the operating margin slipped to 15% from 16%.\n\nThe number of paying customers with more than 10 users rose 8% to 61,803. Large customers also grew sharply, with those generating over $50,000 in ARR up 36% and those over $100,000 in ARR up 46% from the prior year.

Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude share-based compensation.\nmonday.com believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to monday.com's financial condition and results of operations. monday.com management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare monday.com performance to that of prior periods, for trend analysis and for budgeting and planning purposes. monday.com believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing monday.com financial results to the results of other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nManagement does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in monday.com financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation tables of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. monday.com urges investors to review these reconciliation tables and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the monday.com business. Management is not able to forecast GAAP operating income (loss) on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting share-based compensation expense, the amounts of which may be significant in future periods. Management is not able to forecast GAAP net cash provided by operating activities on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting property and equipment purchases and capitalized software costs, the amounts of which may be significant in future periods.\nDefinitions of Business Key Performance Indicators\nNet Dollar Retention Rate\nWe calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from customers as of the 12 months prior to such period end (\"Prior Period ARR\"). We then calculate the ARR from these customers as of the current period end (\"Current Period ARR\"). The calculation of Current Period ARR includes any upsells, contraction and attrition. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the Net Dollar Retention Rate. For the trailing 12-month calculation, we take a weighted average of this calculation of our quarterly Net Dollar Retention Rate for the four quarters ending with the most recent quarter.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (\"ARR\")\nIs defined to mean, as of the measurement date, the annualized value of our customer subscription plans assuming that any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook and market positioning.
