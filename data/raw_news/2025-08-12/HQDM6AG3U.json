NEW YORK, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pony AI Inc. (\u201cPony.ai\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: PONY), a global leader in achieving large-scale commercialization of autonom",
  "content": "Dr. Leo Wang, Chief Financial Officer of Pony.ai, commented, \u201cWe delivered strong results in the second quarter, with total revenues growing 76% year-over-year, reflecting the effectiveness of our go-to-market execution. Our robust Robotaxi fare-charging revenues growth once again underscores our progress in building a scalable and recurring monetization model and enhancing long-term business visibility. As Gen-7 mass production gains momentum and we maintain disciplined investment, we are well positioned to accelerate the large-scale commercialization.\u201d\n\nDr. Tiancheng Lou, Chief Technology Officer of Pony.ai, commented, \u201cOur leading position in the Robotaxi industry is built on two key pillars, fully-driverless and scale, both of which we have already achieved. With extensive real-world testing and operations across diverse conditions, we have demonstrated our commitment to rigorous engineering practices, the reliability of the autonomous driving stack and the strong generalization capabilities powered by our proprietary PonyWorld. With mass production underway, we are not just on track to reach 1,000 vehicles but building the foundation for sustained future growth.\u201d\n\nDr. James Peng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pony.ai, commented, \u201cThis quarter marked a significant milestone in our journey toward large-scale production and deployment, further solidifying our leadership in the Robotaxi industry. Since mass production started two months ago, over 200 1 Gen-7 Robotaxi vehicles have rolled off the production line, putting us firmly on track to hit the year-end 1,000-vehicle target. Our robust Robotaxi revenues more than doubled, with fare-charging revenues surging by over 300% year-over-year. The path toward positive unit economics is also clear, as we made substantial improvements in key cost items such as remote assistance and vehicle insurance. These achievements are underpinned by our rapid scaling and operational breakthroughs in all four tier-one cities in China, coupled with expanded presence in Dubai, South Korea and Luxembourg. As we enter the second half of this pivotal year of mass production, we are driving strongly toward positive unit economics and accelerating our multi-year growth trajectory.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pony AI Inc. (\u201cPony.ai\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: PONY), a global leader in achieving large-scale commercialization of autonomous mobility, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nLeading National Presence \u2014 Launched fully-driverless commercial operations in Shanghai; the ONLY Company commercially operating fully-driverless Robotaxi services across all four tier-one cities in China.\n\nKicking off Robotaxi Scaling-up, a Strong Validation of our Scalable Fully-Driverless Advantage\n\u2022 Mass production and operations of multiple Gen-7 Robotaxi models. 1) We kicked off mass production of the Guangzhou Automobile Group (\u201cGAC\u201d) and Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation (\u201cBAIC\u201d) Gen-7 Robotaxi models in June and July, respectively. With over 200 already produced, we\u2019re accelerating toward our 1,000-vehicle target by the end of 2025. 2) We initiated operations in all four tier-one cities, collectively accumulating over 2 million kilometers of on-road autonomous driving mileage. This showcases the safety and stability of our entire autonomous driving stack in complex real-world scenarios. 3) We have made significant progress in cost efficiency, driven by an improving remote assistant-to-vehicle ratio and lower vehicle insurance. We are confident of achieving a 1:30 ratio by the end of 2025, enabling one remote assistant to monitor 30 vehicles.\n\u2022 Two key pillars for technological advancement: fully-driverless and scale. 1) By achieving fully-driverless operations on a large scale, we have already established ourselves as one of the leading Robotaxi companies worldwide. 2) Among all participants in the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (\u201cWAIC\u201d) 2025 in Shanghai, we were the only provider offering fully-driverless and on-demand ride-hailing services to the public. In addition, we were the only one to remain fully-operational during extreme weather conditions, including typhoons and heavy rainstorms.\n\u2022 Accelerating commercial deployment and expanding ecosystem at scale. 1) Growing user adoption, increasing fleet of deployed Robotaxi vehicles and optimizing operational strategy collectively propelled our fare-charging revenues growth, establishing a sustainable monetization model. 2) We entered into a strategic partnership with Shenzhen Xihu Corporation Limited (\u201cXihu Group\u201d), Shenzhen\u2019s largest taxi operator, to jointly deploy a fleet of over 1,000 Gen-7 Robotaxis in Shenzhen over the coming years.\n\u2022 Scaling up service availability to a wider user group. 1) Registered users on our platform surged by 136% year-over-year in the second quarter. 2) We secured testing permits for Gen-7 Robotaxis in all four tier-one cities, laying out a solid foundation for public-facing commercial deployment. 3) In July, we started fully-driverless commercial Robotaxi services to the public in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong New Area, the heart of Shanghai\u2019s financial district and luxury retails. 4) We extended Robotaxi services from 15 hours per day to full 24/7 coverage in certain areas of Guangzhou and Shenzhen to better fulfill rising user demand.\n\nExpanding Global Presence by Entering New Markets and Deepening Our Existing Footprint\n\u2022 Strategic collaboration with local partners. We have reached a strategic collaboration with Dubai\u2019s Roads and Transport Authority (\u201cRTA\u201d) to integrate our autonomous driving technology into the city\u2019s future transportation ecosystem. The collaboration will deploy our autonomous driving technology through a multi-phase roll-out, starting with supervised Robotaxi trials in late 2025.\n\u2022 Advancing operations to cover diverse environments. We have advanced our presence in South Korea by securing nationwide permits, enabling Robotaxi operations across the country. In Gangnam district, Seoul, we are navigating complex urban traffic and challenging conditions, including winter snowfall. In the second quarter, we further launched nighttime and early-morning operations.\n\u2022 Ongoing positive regulatory and testing progress. Following the testing permit granted earlier this year in Luxembourg, we launched road testing in the city of Lenningen in the second quarter in partnership with Emile Weber, Luxembourg\u2019s leading mobility and fleet service provider.\n\n1 As of August 11, 2025, 213 Gen-7 Robotaxi vehicles had been produced.\n\u2022 Total revenues were US$21.5 million (RMB153.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 75.9% from US$12.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was mainly driven by robust growth in both Robotaxi services and Licensing and Applications revenues.\n\u2022 Robotaxi services revenues were US$1.5 million (RMB10.9 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 157.8% from US$0.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. Revenues from both fare-charging and project-based engineering solution services demonstrated rapid growth, with fare-charging revenues surging by over 300% year-over-year. The strong growth was primarily driven by expanding user adoption, growing demand in tier-one cities and an increased fleet of deployed Robotaxi vehicles. We also continued to optimize our pricing and operation strategies across diverse user bases, leading to improved user engagement and service efficiency.\n\u2022 Robotruck services revenues were US$9.5 million (RMB68.2 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing a decrease of 9.9% from US$10.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease primarily reflected our proactive operation optimization to focus on high-margin revenues.\n\u2022 Licensing and applications revenues were US$10.4 million (RMB74.6 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing a significant increase of 901.8% from US$1.0 million in the second quarter of 2024. The growth was mainly driven by increased orders and deliveries of autonomous domain controller (\u201cADC\u201d) products, supported by rising demand from both new and existing clients in the robot-delivery segment.\n\u2022 Total cost of revenues was US$18.0 million (RMB128.9 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 47.0% from US$12.2 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\u2022 Gross profit was US$3.5 million (RMB24.8 million) in the second quarter of 2025, compared to gross loss of US$41 thousand in the second quarter of 2024.\n\u2022 Gross margin was 16.1% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to negative 0.3% in the second quarter of 2024. The significant gross margin improvement was mainly driven by our focused strategy on prioritizing high-margin revenues sources within Robotaxi and Robotruck services to reduce gross margin variability. We also made solid progress in optimizing Robotaxi unit economics, particularly key cost items such as remote assistance and vehicle insurance.\n\nOperating expenses were US$64.7 million (RMB463.7 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 75.1% from US$37.0 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in share-based compensation expenses reflected the normalization of expense recognition following our IPO in November 2024, as vesting is no longer contingent on IPO completion. Non-GAAP2 operating expenses were US$57.5 million (RMB412.1 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 58.5% from US$36.3 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in mass production, alongside employee expenses aimed at strengthening R&D capacity for Gen-7 Robotaxi vehicles.\n\u2022 Research and development expenses were US$49.0 million (RMB351.2 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 69.0% from US$29.0 million in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were US$44.1 million (RMB315.6 million), representing an increase of 53.3% from US$28.7 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was mainly due to i) investments in mass production for the Gen-7 vehicles and ii) increased employee compensation and benefits to strengthen technological capabilities.\n\u2022 Selling, general and administrative expenses were US$15.7 million (RMB112.5 million) in the second quarter of 2025, representing an increase of 97.3% from US$8.0 million in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were US$13.5 million (RMB96.5 million), representing an increase of 78.2% from US$7.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to i) increased personnel expenses in preparation for large-scale commercial deployment and ii) increased professional service fees.\n\u2022 Loss from operations was US$61.3 million (RMB438.9 million) in the second quarter of 2025, compared to US$37.0 million in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP loss from operations was US$54.1 million (RMB387.3 million), compared to US$36.3 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\u2022 Net loss was US$53.3 million (RMB381.6 million) in the second quarter of 2025, compared to US$30.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP net loss was US$46.1 million (RMB329.9 million) in the second quarter of 2025, compared to US$30.3 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\u2022 Basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share was both US$0.14 (RMB1.00) in the second quarter of 2025, compared to US$0.92 in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share was both US$0.13 (RMB0.93) in the second quarter of 2025, compared to US$0.91 in the second quarter of 2024. Each American depositary shares (\u201cADS\u201d) represents one Class A ordinary share.\n\u2022 Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and long-term debt instruments for wealth management were US$747.7 million (RMB5,356.1 million) as of June 30, 2025. In the second quarter of 2025, financing activities provided cash of US$33.1 million, showing an increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. This was mainly due to employee share sales following the expiration of the lock-up period, resulting in funds collected on behalf of employees for future distribution.\n\n2 Non-GAAP financial measures exclude share-based compensation expenses and changes in fair value of warrants liability, and such adjustment has no impact on income tax. For further details, see the \u201cUnaudited Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\u201d set forth at the end of this earnings release.\n\nPony.ai will hold a conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Tuesday, August 12, 2025 (8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong Time on the same day) to discuss financial results and answer questions from investors and analysts.\n\nFor participants who wish to join the call, please complete online registration using the link provided below prior to the scheduled call start time.

Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to USD were made at the rate of RMB7.1636 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June 30, 2025, in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or USD amounts referred could be converted into USD or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all. For analytical presentation, all percentages are calculated using the numbers presented in the financial statements contained in this earnings release.\n\nThe Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss attributable to Pony AI Inc., non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share, and non-GAAP free cash flows, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and changes in fair value of warrants liability, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company\u2019s past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company\u2019s management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company\u2019s operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\nThe Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company\u2019s performance.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \u201cUnaudited Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\u201d set forth at the end of this earnings release.\n\nPony AI Inc. is a global leader in achieving large-scale commercialization of autonomous mobility.
