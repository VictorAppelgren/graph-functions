  "content": "The kids are all right.\n\nThe \u201cMost Conservative College\u201d in the country is just a short drive from liberal Los Angeles, according to the 2026 Best Colleges guide from the Princeton Review.\n\nThe Princeton Review is a leading tutoring, test prep, and college admissions services company.\n\n\u201cThe colleges we profile in our \u2018Best Colleges\u2019 book are a truly select group. They constitute only about 15% of America\u2019s nearly 2,400 four-year institutions,\u201d said Rob Franek, Editor-in-Chief of The Princeton Review and the book\u2019s lead author.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t rank colleges based on our opinion of them nor would we crown a school \u2018best\u2019 overall,\u201d Franek explained.\n\n\u201cOur goal since day one on this project,\u201d he continued, \u201chas been to provide multiple resources to help college applicants answer what is for most the toughest question in their journey to college, \u2018Which college is best for me?\u2018\u201d\n\nTo help answer that, the new guide features two-page profiles of all 391 schools, as well as 50 ranking list categories, such as \u201cMost Religious Students\u201d and \u201cHappiest Students\u201d \u2014 including Grove City College in Pennsylvania and Claremont McKenna College in California.\n\nBut the school with the most conservative students is Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, California, with an undergraduate population of just 372.\n\nThomas Aquinas is a private, conservative, Catholic liberal arts institution, located in Ventura County, near Los Angeles.\n\nIt was established in 1971 and is known for its use of the Socratic method, where all classes are discussion-based and led by professors \u2014 called tutors \u2014 who guide conversations through questions.\n\nThe small student-to-faculty ratio \u2014 11:1 \u2014 fosters a close-knit environment where tutors are deeply engaged, approachable, and supportive, often interacting with students outside the classroom.\n\nThe population is nearly evenly split between men and women and students from in and out of state, but predominantly (63%) white.\n\nThe college community is described as friendly, faith-centered, and intellectually driven. Many students are motivated by their Catholic beliefs and are seen as studious, kind, and eager to help others.\n\nMeanwhile, just up the coast, sits the school with the most liberal students \u2014 Reed College in progressive Portland, Ore.\n\nFounded in 1908, Reed is a private liberal arts institution with an undergraduate enrollment of 1,346.\n\nReed College advertises a student-driven environment. With 38 majors, 17 minors, and two dual-degree programs, Reed emphasizes personal inquiry through a structured curriculum that includes a yearlong humanities course, broad distribution requirements, and a senior thesis.\n\nReedies are known for being academically passionate, inclusive, and deeply involved in learning \u2014 often pursuing niche interests outside their majors. The school is particularly welcoming to LGBTQIA+ and gender minority students.\n\nThe population is nearly evenly split between men and women, but mostly (85%) students from out of state and 58% white.\n\nNotably, Reed ranks among the top schools nationally for the percentage of graduates who earn PhDs. Many alumni also go on to earn advanced degrees or become leaders in their fields.",

      "text": "Location\nLocated in the progressive, dynamic city of Portland, Oregon, Reed's campus encompasses 116 acres of rolling lawns and winding paths, a century of distinct periods of architectural design, over 2,000 trees representing more than 125 species, and a 28-acre watershed that is home to a growing population of wildlife and native plants. Century-old Tudor gothic buildings are interspersed with modern, LEED-certified centers and residence halls.\nReed is also a gateway to the natural wonders of the Pacific Northwest and a point of entry to the energy and excitement of Portland. Campus sits at the intersection of several vibrant neighborhoods. Many students spend their free time visiting the city's food carts, exploring the Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge, and heading downtown to visit Powell's City of Books, the world's largest independent bookstore.\nBeyond the borders of the city, the windswept beaches of the Oregon Coast and the snow-capped mountains of the Cascade Range are both just an hour and a half away. Many students take advantage of the college's proximity to the great outdoors by going on day trips through Reed's outdoor education center, spending a weekend at the Reed-owned ski cabin on Mount Hood, or using Reed's backpacking co-op to stock up on gear for their own adventures.\nCampus Facilities & Equipment\nThe social center of the college is the Gray Campus Center. It includes a commons building, student union, kitchen, dining room, private meeting rooms, student activities offices, bookstore, and mail services.\nAt the physical center of campus is the canyon, a beautiful wooded area surrounding a spring-fed lake and emergent marsh. A walking trail around the lake provides numerous opportunities to observe migratory birds and other woodland wildlife.\nReed's Performing Arts Building is another vital community space that represents the college's commitment to the important role the arts have played throughout Reed's history. The departments of music, dance, and theatre are housed in one building that includes rehearsal and performance space, scene and costume studios, collaborative spaces, a multimedia lab, and offices.\nHousing at Reed includes traditional residence halls, as well as co-ops and language houses. All communities on campus have access to full kitchens and ample common spaces for group studying and spontaneous conversation. Reed's newest residence hall, Trillium, opened in 2019 and has earned a LEED Platinum certification.\nOff-Campus Opportunities\nReed has partnered with 80 universities and programs in over 30 countries and territories to provide opportunities for off-campus study. Domestic programs include Howard University in Washington, D.C., and Sea Education Association in Massachusetts. In addition, Reed provides study abroad opportunities in Argentina, Australia, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Palestine, Peru, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, Tanzania, Turkey, Turks and Caicos, and the United Kingdom. Students may also arrange independent study plans in consultation with appropriate faculty members.\nIf \"you are looking to party or become enthralled in a sports culture\" or Greek life, Reed is not the school for you, as students here \"pride themselves on the amount of work they have to do.\" That said, \"Reedies are also very laid-back, making sure that time for work has corresponding times for play.\" That's how you wind up with traditions like the Thesis Parade, in which costumed seniors burn their notes and drafts in a bonfire, or \"themed dances where you get to dress up, dance, and let loose.\" The college has \"a program called 'The Gray Fund' which helps fund all types of activities that are completely outside of academics,\" and these \"can be as extensive as weeklong trips, or as simple as visits to the local cat Caf\u00c3\u00a9.\" The pool hall is a massively popular meeting space, and there are weekly events \"where students gather for pool tournaments and hanging out.\" Since this bunch is generally creative, many here \"play a lot of board games, have radio shows at the station, knit or crochet, or play musical instruments.\" Downtown Portland \"is very easily accessed by bus\" and students also \"take day trips to the Oregon coast and go into the mountains near the city.\""

      "text": "I had no idea I was pregnant until I gave birth on the toilet \u2014 on my vacation\nShe thought she was going no. 2 \u2014 but it turned out to be kiddo no. 3.\nHelen and Michael Green, both 45, were on vacation in Toronto, Canada, for a 10-day road trip with their 6-year-old daughter Darcy \u2014 though they had no idea Helen was nine months pregnant.\nThey arrived at their Holiday Inn hotel room on May 21 and tucked into bed by 11 p.m.\nLess than three hours later, the Brit from Bristol woke up with stomach pains and ran towards the bathroom with the sudden \u201curge to push.\u201d\n\u201cI had no idea what was happening, my body just took over,\u201d she shared with SWNS. \u201cAfter two massive pushes, there was a baby, so I picked her up out of the loo and held her in my arms.\u201d\nImagine her husband\u2019s shock when he woke up to the sound of a crying infant.\nMichael immediately called the first responders, and a fire crew arrived within 10 minutes to take them to Mount Sinai Hospital.\n\u201cI was in such a daze, we could hardly work out what was going on,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if the baby was well or whether it was full term. We didn\u2019t even check to see whether it was a boy or a girl \u2014 a paramedic told us.\u201d\nHelen had experienced what medical pros call a cryptic pregnancy \u2014 despite experiencing regular periods along the way.\n\u201cI had no idea at all that I was pregnant; everything seemed completely normal,\u201d Helen said. \u201cI worked, exercised, wore the same clothes and ate the same food as usual.\u201d\n\u201cEven the doctors at the hospital were really surprised.\u201d\nHelen had no symptoms during the pregnancy and experienced a series of miscarriages after giving birth to Darcy, so she assumed she was perimenopausal.\n\u201cIn the hospital, they kept asking me about the pregnancy, and I couldn\u2019t answer them, I just kept saying \u2018I don\u2019t know.'\u201d\nHelen, who also has an 18-year-old son, Harry, claimed she had \u201cmassive bumps\u201d during her two previous pregnancies.\nThough it was \u201csuch a huge, huge shock,\u201d the family is overjoyed with the \u201clovely surprise\u201d of their now 11-week-old daughter, Olivia, whom they named after one of the nurses in the hospital.\n\u201cShe just came along and it feels like she\u2019s always been with us,\u201d Helen said. \u201cEverything feels complete now. She has made us all so happy.\u201d\nMichael, who works in financial services, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy and still feels surreal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a bonkers time. She\u2019s such a joy!\u201d\nFamily and friends were reportedly dumbfounded when Helen and Michael sent text messages that said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, but Helen is in the hospital,\u201d along with a picture of Darcy holding Olivia.\nMom and baby were discharged the following day, but because Olivia had no documents, they couldn\u2019t leave Canada and had to wait for the birth certificate and passport.\n\u201cRegistering her birth was a nightmare. All we had were discharge papers from hospital,\u201d Helen explained. \u201cThere was confusion over whether she was a home birth because she was born in a hotel, or a hospital birth because the placenta was delivered in a hospital.\u201d\nThey had to get signed documents from doctors and paramedics, and said the whole process was \u201cvery draining and stressful.\u201d\nThe family combated their bureaucratic woes by taking their four-day-old to one of Toronto\u2019s architectural marvels, the CN Tower, visiting Niagara Falls \u2014 twice \u2014 and attending three baseball games.\n\u201cUltimately, we got an extended holiday and had a really really special time together,\u201d Helen said. \u201cIt was very hard not knowing how long we would be there, and very stressful on week days chasing the birth certificate and passport, but great at the weekends when all the offices were closed and there was nothing we could do about it.\u201d\nThe family was eventually able to fly home on June 25 \u2014 more than a month after their Canadian tour began \u2014 and spent an estimated $12,200 more than they expected, including about $5,400 in hospital fees, over $2,700 in hotels, and nearly $1,400 for the hire car, flights home, baby equipment and living costs.\nBut they said that travel insurance will hopefully cover most of those costs.\n\u201cGetting your head round having a baby is hard, but it\u2019s something else when you didn\u2019t know you were pregnant,\u201d Helen said.\n\u201cWithin a few days, it just started to feel familiar that I had a baby, and such a joy.\u201d"

      "text": "The Princeton Review\u2019s Best Colleges for 2026 Rankings Are Out\nLists of Top 25 Colleges in 50 Categories Based on 170,000 Students'\nRatings & Reports About Their Schools\nNEW YORK, August 12, 2025 / \u2014 The Princeton Review\u00ae \u2014one of the nation\u2019s leading education services companies\u2014has reported its 2026 Best Colleges rankings.\nThe company's 50 categories of college rankings posted on PrincetonReview.com today. They are also published in The Best 391 Colleges: 2026 Edition (Penguin Random House, $26.99) which went on sale today. Widely known for its multiple categories of student survey\u2013based ranking lists, The Princeton Review's popular college guide is in its 34th annual edition.\nThe 50 ranking lists each name the top 25 colleges (of those in the book) in a specific category. Among them are lists on subjects of high interest to parents including Great Financial Aid and Best Career Services. Others report on subjects students often inquire about on campus tours\u2014Best Campus Food, Best College Dorms, College City Gets High Marks, and Profs Get High Marks.\nAll the ranking lists are based on The Princeton Review's surveys of students attending the schools in the book who rate their own colleges on dozens of topics and report on their campus experiences at them. The rankings reported today are based on data from the company's surveys of 170,000 students at the 391 schools in the book (about 435 per school on average). The surveys were conducted in 2024\u201325 and/or the previous two academic years.\nA new ranking list\u2014Most Politically Moderate Students\u2014was added to the project this year in consideration of the rising political polarization in the country. It, as well as two related lists that have long been in the book\u2014Most Politically Liberal Students and Most Politically Conservative Students\u2014is based on a survey question that asks students their assessment of their personal political views.\nA summary below reveals the #1 colleges on the lists mentioned above (as well as the top colleges in other high interest categories). A summary that follows provides further detail about the annual Best Colleges project and the 2026 edition and rankings.\nSome of The Princeton Review's 50 categories of Best Colleges ranking lists and the #1 colleges on the lists for 2026 are:\n- Professors Get High Marks \u2014 #1 Sarah Lawrence College (NY)\n- Best Classroom Experience\u2014 #1 Washington and Lee University (VA)\n- Best-Run Colleges \u2014 #1 High Point University (NC)\n- Great Financial Aid \u2014 #1 Washington and Lee University (VA)\n- Best Career Services \u2014 #1 Bentley University (MA)\n- Best Student Support and Counseling Services \u2014 #1 Seton Hall University (NJ)\n- Best Health Services \u2014 #1 University of Virginia\n- Best Campus Food \u2014 #1 University of Massachusetts\u2014Amherst\n- Best College Dorms \u2014 #1 Washington University in St. Louis (MO)\n- Most Beautiful Campus \u2014 #1 The University of the South (TN)\n- Most Politically Conservative Students \u2014#1 Thomas Aquinas College (CA)\n- Most Politically Liberal Students \u2014 #1 Reed College (OR)\n- Most Politically Moderate Students \u2014 #1 University of Richmond (VA)\n- Most Religious Students \u2014 #1 Grove City College (PA)\n- LGBTQ-Friendly \u2014 #1 College of the Atlantic (ME)\n- College City Gets High Marks \u2014 #1 American University (DC)\n- Lots of Race/Class Interaction \u2014 #1 Harvey Mudd College (CA)\n- Friendliest Students \u2014 #1 Claremont McKenna College (CA)\n- Happiest Students \u2014 #1 Texas Christian University\n- Their Students Love These Colleges \u2014 #1 Washington State University\nA special feature in the new edition of the book, Statistical Stand-Out Schools for 2026, identifies colleges in the book with compelling distinctions based on data from The Princeton Review's institutional survey for the project. Among them are college(s) in the book with the:\n- Highest Average Need-Based Scholarships \u2014 $74,113 / Williams College (MA)\n- Lowest Public School In-state Tuition & Fees \u2014 $6,368 / University of South Florida\n- Lowest Private School Tuition & Fees \u2014$21,538 / William Jewell College (MO)\n- Lowest Average Undergraduate Debt \u2014 $7,242 / City University of New York: City College\n- Most Diverse Student Body \u2014 City University of New York: Brooklyn College\n\"The colleges we profile in our 'Best Colleges' book are a truly select group. They constitute only about 15% of America's nearly 2,400 four-year institutions\" said Rob Franek, Editor-in-Chief of The Princeton Review and the book's lead author. \"While they vary by locale, type, size, and campus culture, each one offers its students an academically outstanding undergraduate education. In our opinion, they are the nation's best undergraduate colleges and ideal choices for students seeking their 'best-fit' college.\"\n\"The colleges that make our ranking lists do so entirely as a result of their own students' opinions of them,\" Franek added. \"We don't rank colleges based on our opinion of them nor would we crown a school 'best' overall. It is what the students attending the colleges in this book tell us about their experiences at their schools that determines on which lists the schools appear in our book. Our goal since day one on this project has been to provide multiple resources to help college applicants answer what is for most the toughest question in their journey to college, 'Which college is best for me? '\"\nFranek can be seen in a video that posted today on the company's YouTube channel reporting on the release of The Best 391 Colleges. In the video, he cites extraordinary facts about the top colleges on three of the book's most popular ranking list categories.\nAbout The Princeton Review's Best Colleges Book and Rankings\nPublished since 1992, The Princeton Review's Best Colleges book profiles schools the company's editors and staff deem the nation's best based on data gathered from their survey of administrators at more than 2,000 schools as well as input from college advisors and admissions experts. The profiles feature information on admission and aid application requirements, acceptance rates, accepted students' test scores, and enrollment and student body demographics. They also share The Princeton Review's Inside Word about the school's admission and acceptance trends and report the company's ratings (scores from 60 to 99) of the schools in eight categories including Admissions Selectivity and Financial Aid. The book's 50 ranking lists (each of which name the top 25 colleges in a specific category) are entirely based on surveys of students attending the schools. Information on the student survey, survey method (which uses a Likert scale), methodology, and basis for each ranking list is here.\nOther features in the book include a list titled Great Schools for 22 of the Most Popular Undergraduate Majors. It is based on data from the company's institutional survey and opinions of The Princeton Review's National College Counselor Advisory Board. (New on this list in the 2026 edition are suggestions of great schools for Artificial Intelligence majors.) Five Honor Rolls list in alphabetical order the colleges in the book with distinctive attributes. One names the Tuition-Free schools. Three others name the schools in the book that received the company's highest (99) rating score for Financial Aid, Fire Safety, and Green (i.e. commitment to sustainability and the environment). A Mental Health Services Honor Roll names the colleges with exceptional commitments to providing mental health and well-being services for their students. The book also includes the company's Best Value Colleges, Best Colleges for Game Design and Best Colleges for Entrepreneurship Studies ranking lists.\nThe Best 391 Colleges is one of more than 150 books developed by The Princeton Review and published by Penguin Random House. Other college-related books in the line include College Admission 101 (May 2022), Essays That Kicked Apps (September 2023), and Paying for College (2026 edition on sale September 16, 2025).\nAbout The Princeton Review\nThe Princeton Review is a leading tutoring, test prep, and college admissions services company.

      "text": "DEAR ABBY: My parents divorced when I was in high school, and Dad kept the house I grew up in. I\u2019m in college across town and have my own place, but I still visited Dad often. As a teenager, it used to be my job to cook the family dinner two nights a week. I loved it and continued to cook when I was visiting.\nDad now has a serious girlfriend who has moved in with him. She\u2019s uncomfortable with a \u201cguest\u201d being in \u201cher\u201d kitchen and says it\u2019s appropriate for me to only be in the living room when I visit. If I want a glass of water, I\u2019m supposed to ask her for it. She calls it being a good host, but it feels like a power move to push me out. Dad says it\u2019s her house and her rules.\nI\u2019m sad that what was my home for 18 years is now off-limits. I get that she\u2019s insecure about the relationship and wants to put some distance between me and my dad, but I no longer feel welcome in the house I grew up in because she\u2019s so rigid. I have invited them (both) to my place, but they haven\u2019t accepted. What do I do now? \u2014 PUSHED OUT IN ARKANSAS\nDEAR PUSHED: Your father\u2019s girlfriend appears to be both controlling and insecure, and your father has made clear that he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat. Under the circumstances, you have no choice but to follow the new \u201chouse rules.\u201d If you can abide by them, visit your dad. If you can\u2019t reconcile yourself, then you may have to wait for him to miss your presence in his life before he will consent to be a guest at your place. (What a sad state of affairs. I\u2019m sorry.)\nDEAR ABBY: I am an animal person. I love all kinds, but when it comes to dogs, I don\u2019t like the smell, the mess, the fur, the jumping, the slobbering and the general mayhem of an untrained dog. My spouse\u2019s family has many dogs, big and small. They\u2019re not trained \u2014 the family prefers them that way. They think it\u2019s \u201ccute\u201d when they jump or climb on a visitor\u2019s lap. They believe it\u2019s a way to \u201cwin people over.\u201d Their dogs are allowed on the furniture, making it very smelly. They also feed them while we are at the dinner table.\nI understand people love their pets and treat them like family, and I wouldn\u2019t expect them to change their ways for me. But I also don\u2019t see why I should subject myself to something that disgusts me.\nIs there a polite way to tell them I am not comfortable eating or visiting in their home? I\u2019ve learned the quickest way to pick a fight is to say \u201cI don\u2019t like dogs\u201d to a dog person. (I have a cat but would never dream of dragging her out in public or to someone\u2019s home.) My in-laws also allow smoking in their home. I am a non-smoker. I don\u2019t do bad smells well. Have you any advice? \u2014 IN THE DOGHOUSE IN FLORIDA\nDEAR \u201cDOGHOUSE\u201d: I sure do. Be open and honest with your dog-loving in-laws. Tell them exactly what you have written to me, and (trust me on this) you won\u2019t be subjected to their hospitality again. Problem solved.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips. Contact Dear Abby at http://www.DearAbby.com or P.O. Box 69440, Los Angeles, CA 90069."

      "text": "Gen Z\u2019s latest obsession \u2014 coming out as \u2018graysexual\u2019: What it means, and how they\u2019re discovering they\u2019re \u2018gray\u2019\nThey\u2019re not gay \u2014 they\u2019re \u201cgray.\u201d\nA surprising number of people are choosing to identify as \u201cgraysexual,\u201d with many now sharing the moment they realized they were \u201cgray.\u201d\nGraysexuality exists in what many describe as a \u201cgray area\u201d between being allosexual \u2013 experiencing regular sexual attraction \u2014 and asexual \u2014 experiencing none. Those who identify as graysexual may feel sexual attraction rarely, inconsistently, or only under specific circumstances.\nReddit users are posting in the r/Graysexuality subreddit \u2014 a growing online community of over 8,300 members \u2014 about their experiences dating and being intimate.\nIn one post, user @The_Archer2121 explained that they had spent much of their life assuming they were just a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d Crushes came \u201cdecades apart,\u201d rarely lasted long, and they often didn\u2019t feel sexual attraction \u2014 even to their own boyfriend.\nAs Dan Beeson, a graysexual man from London, told Cosmopolitan UK, \u201cGraysexual\u2026 is not \u2018I just don\u2019t fancy it tonight\u2019. For me, it\u2019s being completely devoid of sexual desire in bouts, which can last months, and then one day waking up and realising that instinct has returned.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d been aware my drive for sex wasn\u2019t as regular as others, but I just put it down to my own relationship with sex. That may still be true, but finding out others were having similar feelings and there was at least a community of some number of us was reassuring,\u201d he added.\nOthers online chimed in with similar stories.\nOne user said they only ever felt \u201ctrue\u201d sexual attraction once in their life, explaining, \u201cWhen I see someone attractive, I don\u2019t have that \u2018I\u2019d hit that\u2019 internal feeling. I just want to be near them.\u201d\nAnother recalled being pressured to experiment with sex in college, confused about why their peers seemed to experience desire so intensely and frequently. \u201cEnded up getting married (not a good life choice), and things didn\u2019t go well in the sexual department.\u201d\n\u201cI was constantly ridiculed and pressured into doing things that I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d\nThat mismatch in sexual expectations eventually led the person to discover graysexuality through online communities.\nOne person wrote that their attraction would \u201cturn on\u201d only every few months, making them flip-flop between identifying as allosexual and asexual, until they found graysexuality \u2014 and a sense of peace.\nInterest in graysexuality is growing rapidly \u2014 especially with Gen Z.\nOn platforms like TikTok and YouTube, videos exploring the term are gaining thousands of views. Creators like podcaster Mark (@notdefining) have helped bring nuance to the identity, describing it as \u201ca bit of sexual attraction\u2026 but to a low degree.\u201d\nMany assume that graysexual people don\u2019t want romantic relationships or are simply repressed. But as psychotherapist Jane Czyzselska explains, \u201cIt can be hard in both queer and wider culture to confidently own a sexuality that acknowledges desire differently.\u201d\nShe encourages those exploring the label to reflect on what contexts spark or suppress desire, and to trust their own changing boundaries. \u201cNo one should tell you who you should be or who you are,\u201d she says.\nThe term graysexual first appeared on the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) in 2006 and has since become an important identity for those who never quite fit into the binary of sexual or asexual. Some people who identify as graysexual may also relate to terms like demisexual \u2014 sexual attraction only after a strong emotional bond \u2014 queer, or pansexual.\nAs one Reddit user summed it up: \u201cI was so repressed in this regard out of pure confusion\u2026 It was such a relief to finally have a word for how I feel.\u201d\nThe rise of identities like graysexuality comes amid what researchers are calling a \u201csex recession\u201d \u2014 with younger generations reporting fewer sexual partners and less interest in sex overall.\nBut rather than a simple lack of desire, experts like writer Carter Sherman argue it\u2019s more nuanced, involving social media pressure, body image issues, and political anxieties."
