  "title": "Chime Leans on Cost Edge to Win \u2018Unhappily Banked\u2019",
  "description": "Chime\u2019s first outing as a public company was a success, and CEO Chris Britt did not hedge on ambition. He waited about 30 seconds into the company\u2019s first",
  "content": "Chime\u2019s first outing as a public company was a success, and CEO Chris Britt did not hedge on ambition. He waited about 30 seconds into the company\u2019s first earnings call to tell the audience that he wants nothing less than for Chime to become \u201cthe largest provider of primary account relationships in the U.S.\u201d\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nAnalysts focused less on headline numbers and more on how Chime plans to expand its user base, the durability of member spending, the maturing economics of its earned-wage access feature and whether proposed bank data fees could impact its model. Management\u2019s message: keep widening the top of the funnel, prove out unit economics on new products and lean on a cost base the company says undercuts banks.\n\nBritt said Chime is making it easier for newcomers to try the service before committing their paychecks. The company has broadened \u201cDay One\u201d access by expanding funding rails and enabling features like Apple Pay and mobile check deposit immediately. It is also offering introductory access to value props that used to sit behind a direct deposit \u201cpaywall,\u201d including the Credit Builder card and peer-to-peer payments. The aim is to lift activation and funding rates and let some prospects \u201cdate a bit before they get married\u201d to direct deposit.\n\nSpend per active member has been pressured by new user mix, as these lighter-weight newcomers dilute averages. Underlying trends, management said, remain steady among more tenured direct deposit users, with engagement concentrated in nondiscretionary categories such as food, gas and utilities. Moderating inflation has also taken some wind out of nominal growth rates, Britt added.\n\nMost of the analyst questions concerned earned wage access. A year after launch, MyPay \u2014 Chime\u2019s earned\u2011wage access feature \u2014 is already a roughly $300 million revenue-run-rate business, with attach rates increasing. Members can access up to $500 of earned wages; it\u2019s free if they wait, or $2 for instant delivery. Loss rates improved faster than planned in the quarter, from just over 160 basis points of advance volume in Q1 to about 140 basis points in Q2, and the company is targeting roughly 1% at steady state. Those improvements, plus strong usage, tripled MyPay\u2019s transaction margin quarter over quarter, executives said. The company reiterated in its release that MyPay\u2019s momentum helped drive higher ARPAM and margin progress.\n\nAsked about JPMorgan\u2019s move to charge for access to customer data, Britt said consumers should be able to move their data without fees and noted Chime\u2019s exposure is limited because it owns the primary account relationship for most members. He also pointed to recent CFPB posture suggesting such pricing is unlikely \u201canytime soon.\u201d He added that even if charging became the norm, the company might be a net beneficiary given its primary account position.\n\nThe CEO opened the call by laying out Chime\u2019s stated advantages: cost, product velocity, primary status, and brand.\n\u2022 Cost structure. Chime says it can serve customers at about one-third the cost of a large bank and one-fifth that of a regional bank. The company is migrating onto \u201cChime Core,\u201d its proprietary ledger and processing system, to improve unit costs and speed. It also rolled out a GenAI voice bot that more than doubled satisfaction scores versus the legacy system; management says AI already automates most support interactions and has reduced cost-to-serve nearly 30% since 2022.\n\u2022 Product innovation. Beyond MyPay, Chime is scaling Instant Loans \u2014 small, short-duration installment loans for pre-approved members \u2014 and \u201cChime Plus,\u201d a free tier that packages higher savings rates, cash-back offers and priority support.\n\u2022 Primary account relationship. Chime claims most active members use it as their primary account, averaging 55 transactions a month and checking the app about five times a day \u2014 behavior that underpins payments-based revenue and cross-sell. More than half of new members still come from organic and referral channels, helping keep acquisition costs in check.\n\u2022 Management cited unaided brand awareness of 40% \u2014 on par with the largest U.S. banks \u2014 and recent campaigns featuring high\u2011profile ambassadors.\n\nBy the numbers, revenue rose 37% year over year to $528 million in the quarter ended June 30. Payments revenue grew 19% to $366 million; platform-related revenue (which includes MyPay) climbed 113% to $162 million. Active members increased 23% to 8.7 million; average revenue per active member (ARPAM) rose 12% to $245; purchase volume increased 18% to $32.4 billion. Gross margin was 87% and transaction margin 69%. Guidance calls for Q3 revenue of $525 million to $535 million and full\u2011year revenue of $2.135 billion to $2.155 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin of about 4% for 2025.\n\nAs Britt framed the market Chime is chasing: \u201cIt isn\u2019t the unbanked. It\u2019s the unhappily banked.\u201d",

      "text": "\u201cContrary to what you may read, we have no problem with data sharing but only if it is done properly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt must be authorized by the customer \u2014 the customer should know exactly what data is shared and when and how it is used; third parties should pay for accessing the banking system and payment rails.\u201d\nHis words have become reality \u2014 with implications for financial services, and particularly for data aggregators that have relied on that data to act as a bridge between FinTechs and financial institutions.\nDigital Data Tariff\nJPMorgan told FinTechs that it will charge for access to its customers\u2019 bank information. The fees are likely a work in progress, open to at least some negotiation, but early indications are that they would bring hundreds of millions of dollars to JPMorgan.\nIn terms of the economics, the fees could equate to multiples of the values of the transactions themselves, which means a heavy hit to FinTechs\u2019 profit margins, if they have profits at all.\nIt\u2019s not too far-fetched to draw a parallel with tariffs. Just as businesses that import goods face a tax on that activity, so too would the importing of data from the banks to create new products and services come with an arguable \u201ctax\u201d on that activity.\nPaving the Path\nRule 1033 is not officially dead, but it\u2019s seemingly on life support. A judge is gearing up to decide on vacating the rule via summary judgment, which opens the door for fees on third parties to be levied.\nAs put forth by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the rule had stated that FinTechs would be granted free data access; banks pushed back in court that they should be able to charge for that data.\nThe President Donald Trump administration ushered in an about-face, filing in court that the CFPB overstepped its bounds.\n\u201cThe statute itself simply dictates that data providers \u2018make available to a consumer\u2019 their consumer\u2019s financial data, yet the rule regulates beyond the scope of the statute by mandating that data providers make consumer data available to other commercial actors in a costly and complicated data-sharing system,\u201d the CFPB said.\nFor aggregators such as Plaid, which act as middlemen between banks and FinTechs, and for the FinTechs that rely on transaction volumes \u2014 while connecting to the aggregators rather than by building their own direct bank-by-bank connections \u2014 to boost top lines, the impact could be devastating.\nThat\u2019s because JPMorgan, the largest bank by asset class, has a reported 80 million customers across its retail and commercial lines.\nEarly trading activity Monday (July 14) underscored some of the uncertainty that lies ahead, as shares of Affirm were down nearly 1%, Sezzle was off 1.3% and PayPal was up 3.5%.\nFor Plaid, there is some insulation from the vagaries of the market, as it is not publicly traded. Plaid CEO Zach Perret told PYMNTS in June that financial institutions must allow data movement in and out of their systems to enable consumers to use a range of applications.\n\u201cOne of the bigger concerns I have would be the inconsistency among banks regarding data,\u201d he said, and lack of standardization of data information and flows has resulted in instances where, for example, banks blocked access to cryptocurrency applications, leading consumers to switch banks.\nThe Pass-Through Effect?\nIn accessing bank data for all manner of activities \u2014 such as verifying bank accounts or underwriting credit \u2014 fees would be passed along to FinTechs, and possibly to FinTechs\u2019 end clients.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cDigital Transformation and Instant Payments Fuel Business Disbursement Efficiency\u201d found that in some cases, consumers are willing to pay for speed and convenience when it comes to money movement. Nearly half of disbursement receivers said they are open to paying higher fees for instant transactions when funds are urgently needed. Specifically, 27% are willing to pay a slightly higher fee, and 20% are willing to pay a much higher fee.\nFor FinTech startups, particularly for denizens of the PYMNTS FinTech IPO Index, which is populated with firms that are not yet cash flow positive, margin pressures might force a reckoning of business models.\nPerret told PYMNTS in the June interview that regulatory uncertainty \u201cwill make for a period of chaos.\u201d\nPYMNTS Intelligence found that only about 1 in 10 consumers have used open banking payments (which means that they are sharing their bank account data)."
