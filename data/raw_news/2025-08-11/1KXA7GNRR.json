  "title": "What a Trump Bid for Cut of Chip Revenue Means for China",
  "description": "A revenue-for-exports deal between the US government and two of the world\u2019s biggest chipmakers opens a new front in a trading regime turned upside down by Donald Trump. Bloomberg's Minmin Low and Tom Giles break down what we know so far. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "I deal with Jensen, who is a great guy, and Nvidia. The chip that we're talking about, the H20. It's an old chip. China already has it, in a different form, different name, but they have it. Or, they have a combination of two, will make up for it and even then some. So Blackwell is super duper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that, although it's possible I'd make a deal... A somewhat... Enhanced in a negative way. Blackwell. In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it. But that's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years. But the H20 is obsolete. You know, it's one of those things, but it still has a market. Alright. So, Minmin. The President signaling there may be a scaled back version of the Blackwell chip, may be made available to China, but would China want it? We were discussing yesterday that they're a little bit unsure about some of the security vulnerabilities of the Nvidia chips that they're allowed to access now. That's right. China can now only access the H20 chips, which is the older version. And this is something that Nvidia has said can't be scaled back even more. But the latest Blackwell chip, a scaled down version of that, may still be attractive to China, though. The reason why China has not been so hot on the H20 chips is not only because it's not very advanced. China can already produce chips that can achieve the same level of impact if it combined some of its existing chips together. And so that's one, plus the security risk. So of course, China will still want some sort of reassurance that those chips Nvidia is selling to China will not contain any backdoor to the US government. But the advancement of the next line of chips, that could potentially be something that China would be interested to get its hands on. But of course, as you said, the security risks are still there. That's something that both sides will have to work out. And China will likely continue to pour resources to try to reduce its reliance on US chips. To get a little more on this. Let's bring in Tom Giles now. Tom, Minmin mentioned the security risks from the China point of view, but what are the security risks from the US point of view, this sort of technology subject to export controls? Is that now up for negotiation? Well, you know, for the right price, we can rethink just how concerned we are about the national security implications. But specifically with regard to chips, the US government has historically put strict limits on what kinds of chips can be sold to China. And as Trump said in that clip, that if there are scaled back versions, if there are ones that are not the most advanced, he'd be willing to cut a deal with a company like Nvidia, like the one that's already been announced with AMD and Nvidia on another chip. He'd be willing to make some compromises, make some concessions. The argument being these are not the most advanced chips, the argument being that, well, these don't have the same national security implications that the most advanced chips do. What this is, is a recognition of the vital importance of the Chinese market to these chip companies. And it also is a recognition that that Chinese customers are interested in getting in Nvidia, AMD chips, within reason. Remember that Chinese chip makers are starting to catch up and that sends, you know, that sound, that gives U.S. chip makers a lot of fear and trepidation. They say we need to stay in the market. We need to stay ahead of companies like Smic, like Huawei, and we need to continue to sell our chips into the Chinese market. And they're willing to make concessions. 15% in order to continue to do that.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the implications of the President's proposal for a reduction in chip revenue to China, which is seen as an attempt to reduce its reliance on US chips. However, Minididallah, the author of the article, suggests that China may be open to a scaled back version of the Blackwell chip, which Nvidia has stated cannot be reduced further. The article also discusses the security risks of the H20 chips China is currently only able to access these chips. The security risks are still present, but both sides will need to resolve this issue. The US government has traditionally limited what types of chips can be sold to China and is known for its strict export controls. The author suggests that if there are scaled back versions of these chips that are not the most advanced, Trump may be willing to cut a deal with a company like Nvidia, willing to make compromises.",
  "shortSummary": "President Trump's proposal to cut chip revenue for China may require concessions like the H20 and Blackwell chips, despite China's security concerns and potential market interest.",

While China currently has access only to the H20, there is potential interest in a scaled-down version of the Blackwell chip, despite concerns over security vulnerabilities. The U.S. government has historically imposed strict export controls on advanced chips, but there may be room for negotiation on less advanced models to maintain market presence in China, as U.S. chip makers face increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers.",
