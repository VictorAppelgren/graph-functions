      "feedback": "This draft shows solid structure but needs sharper causal rigor, tighter horizon discipline, and tighter sourcing discipline to reach world-class quality. Edit 1: harden the causal chain by spelling out explicit stepwise links from tariff signals (SGB2PAZGK) to import compression, to domestic-capex reallocation (semiconductors, EVs, AI/data-center infra), and then to earnings/valuation re-pricing, anchoring each step with first-principles drivers (real-rate differentials, terms-of-trade shifts, productivity dynamics, policy-reaction functions) and the stated tariff path (10% baseline to 145%) with precise numbers cited. Edit 2: enforce a formal four-item format with 2 Up and 2 Down, and ensure each line is a single sentence: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, and tether every numeric claim to a source ID (e.g., 4VN4UTWX1, SGB2PAZGK, I2SJU04DF, Z5IA1CYUF, 22PL3Q360, O4ZEED2EB) to avoid soft assertions. Edit 3: adopt a coherent scenario framework: define base, upside, and downside with 2–3 explicit catalysts (tariff clarity, capex milestones, energy-cost stability, EV-margin inflection) and clear invalidation rules (durable tariff concessions, inflation surprise, or a meaningful EV profitability turn) so probabilities update mechanistically. Edit 4: replace vague watchpoints with quantitative thresholds and milestones (e.g., tariff signaling by Q3 2025; Ford EV loss magnitude and ROIC trajectory; Spirit BHVN settlement deadline; Yemen shipping-resilience signals) and tightly align them to the 0–3 week window while avoiding scope drift into longer Netflix/Megatrend threads unless retained with a separate horizon. Edit 5: fix factual misstatements and ensure complete source coverage: correct the Starbucks reference to Laxman Narasimhan and Bezos’ compensation attribution, reconcile any conflicts across SGB2PAZGK/O4ZEED2EB/65UUBU0OR/61SVFUKBY/STBVARD8F, and prune nonessential governance notes unless they function as a true watch signal; ensure all critical sources are represented in the final framing.",
