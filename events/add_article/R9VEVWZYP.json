      "summary": "Scottish Conservative MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from the party, citing concerns over its shift towards reactionary politics under new leader Russell Findlay. Balfour, who will sit as an independent until the May Holyrood election, criticized the party for ignoring senior MSPs and lacking a positive platform for Scotland. His departure follows that of Jamie Greene, who also left the Tories, accusing them of adopting a 'Trump-esque' style and moving away from socially liberal values.",
