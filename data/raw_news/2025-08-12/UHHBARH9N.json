  "description": "GMC trucks have the reputation of an American classic, but are they still made in the United States, and who owns the legacy vehicle brand now?",
  "content": "Where Are GMC Trucks Made, And Who Owns The Company Today?\n\nThe majority of GMC trucks are made in the U.S., though \"Made in America\" doesn't always mean what it once did. GM's historic Flint Assembly factory in Flint, Michigan, is responsible for churning out the heavy-duty Sierra 2500HD and 3500HD models. It's been operational since 1947, and recently just underwent a $150 million upgrade, aimed at accommodating the production of next-gen trucks with mixed-material bodywork and trailering technology. The light-duty Sierra 1500, on the other hand, rolls out of three different assembly plants, depending on trim and drivetrain \u2014 the Fort Wayne Assembly plant in Indiana and GM's assembly complexes in Silao, Mexico, and Ontario, Canada. Models made in Silao are still offered for sale in the U.S., and according to GM, equipment and quality are standard no matter where they're made. Outsourcing is sometimes criticized, and not just for GM. However, in this case, the company's word on quality seems to hold up, with the Silao plant being one of, if not GM's most sophisticated facilities worldwide, producing over 400,000 trucks in 2023 alone. Other GMC variants, such as the Canyon midsize pickup truck, come out of Wentzville, Missouri, whereas electric models like the GMC Hummer EV are made in GM's dedicated EV facility, Factory ZERO, which straddles two cities: same old Detroit (the home of American muscle cars and big block engines) and Hamtramck. In 2020, GM invested $2.2 billion in this facility as a sign of commitment towards an all-electric future.\n\nGMC has never been a stand-alone company. Rather, it has long been, and remains, a division of General Motors (GM) \u2014 one of the largest automakers globally, the largest in the U.S. \u2014 which also owns Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, and previously Saturn, Pontiac, and Hummer (before its EV revival under GMC). The acronym \"GMC,\" which originally stood for \"General Motors Company,\" eventually came to mean \"General Motors Truck Company,\" a name it had as early as 1912 when GM merged multiple truck manufacturers under one division. With its main office in Detroit, Michigan, GM itself is a publicly traded corporation on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker GM. That means just about anyone can own a piece of it, even you. But the biggest shareholders include the same old giant institutions like Vanguard Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., and State Street Corporation, just to name a few. It was founded by William C. Durant in 1908 and rapidly grew to become one of the largest and most influential automakers in the world. Then came the 2009 financial crisis, which had GM file for bankruptcy. 40 days later, the company re-emerged as a solvent, more streamlined business with a much tighter brand focus. Pontiac, Saturn, and Hummer (at the time) were all axed out, but guess who survived \u2014 GMC. The company currently operates over 150 facilities and employs about 162,000 employees worldwide, more than 97,000 of whom are in the U.S.\n\nGMC has always been viewed as Chevy's better-dressed sibling. Same truck DNA, but glossier trims. However, GM appears to be giving it more to work with in the EV era. In fact, GMC was the first brand to roll out a car under GM's new Ultium EV platform, not Chevy or Cadillac. The GMC Hummer EV \u2014 a 9,000-pound beast with four-wheel steering, an engine that can crank out 1,000 horsepower, and a Watts to Freedom mode that sends it from 0 to 60 in roughly three seconds \u2014 was given that honor. GM claims that the car helped in validating the platform's over-the-air update capabilities, torque vectoring tech, and battery pack structure. The GMC Sierra EV shares parts of the Chevy Silverado EV's architecture, but offers more luxurious features and variants like the Denali Edition 1 that roll out off-road-ready. In 2022, GM invested $4 billion in its Orion Assembly plant, all aimed at scaling EV production under Ultium, and production was set to begin shortly after. However, GM's plans seem to have changed after announcing its intention to use the Orion plant for gas-powered full-size SUV and light-duty truck production, which is set to begin in 2027. The plant will also continue to churn out battery modules, which are then shipped to Factory Zero and used in GM's EV lineup, as has been the case since the summer of 2024.",

      "text": "GM Factory ZERO Renames An Old Plant For Its Electric Future\nGM is renaming its Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, with the future home of its all-electric vehicle production now being known as Factory ZERO. The new name \u2013 which hints that someone at General Motors may have watched a few too many superhero movies \u2013 was confirmed today, and is a nod to not only the zero emissions GM Ultium-based EVs will produce.\nIt's also, GM says, a reflection of Factory ZERO's role in pushing zero crashes and zero congestion. They're going to be a little more tricky to achieve, it seems fair to predict, though General Motors divisions like Cruise are hoping that fully autonomous vehicles will at least help on that front.\nThe Cruise Origin, a purpose-designed EV for driverless operations that has no steering wheel or other traditional controls, will be among the first of the vehicles that GM produces at Factory ZERO. The other of note is the GMC Hummer EV, a fully-electric pickup that reboots the Hummer name with a thoroughly different drivetrain from the original. GMC plans to officially unveil the Hummer EV later this month, though production isn't expected to kick off until late in 2021.\nIndeed, while Factory ZERO may have a new name on the sign, it still has some way to go before it can actually begin building cars. GM is currently splashing out $2.2 billion on the facility, upgrading Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center from what used to be the home of models like the Cadillac CT6 and Chevrolet Impala. It's actually no stranger to electrification, either, having been responsible for GM's Chevrolet Volt and Cadillac ELR plug-in hybrids.\nFor the Hummer EV, Cruise Origin, and upcoming EVs like the Cadillac Lyriq, however, the platform will be very different. They'll use GM's new Ultium architecture, a battery and platform combination that will give the automaker hitherto-impossible flexibility in vehicle size, shape, drivetrain, and range. Ultium will also allow GM to expand beyond its own nameplates, with Honda already confirmed to use the technology for EVs of its own.\nAs for Factory ZERO itself, GM has numerous ways in which it aims to cut the plant's environmental impact. There's a 516 kilowatt ground mount solar panel farm helping feed it with power, and a second bank of panels, delivering a further 30 kilowatts, on the carport. GM says it plans to use renewable energy there entirely by 2023.\nThere'll be stormwater treatment which will stockpile water for the cooling towers and the fire suppression system, along with a 16.5 acre wildlife habitat. During the conversion and upgrades, concrete waste from the old plant was used to build temporary roadways, GM says. When open, it's expected to create more than 2,200 jobs in the US.\nIt's fair to say that General Motors hasn't been the most agile of the automakers when it comes to EVs so far. Although it has experimented with PHEVs like the Volt and ELR, currently it only has a single all-electric model \u2013 the Chevrolet Bolt EV \u2013 on the books. As the Cadillac Lyriq previewed, Ultium certainly has promise; however, we'll still need to wait some time to see what Factory ZERO is actually capable of delivering in the real world."

      "text": "2025 GMC Hummer EV SUV Review: Big Price, Big Battery, But Where's The Range?\nYou can't understand the true ridiculousness of the GMC Hummer EV, without first revisiting a little history of the Hummer brand. The \"original\" civilian Hummer from the 1990s, also called the H1, was essentially a road-going version of the military Humvee, complete with endorsement from The Terminator himself.\nThe Hummer H2 got rid of the military underpinnings in favor of a GM truck chassis, yet it cranked up the machismo a significant degree. It was the Largest and In-Chargest vehicle you could get in the era (at least in spirit) and it perfectly encapsulated the Huge Ostentatious Suburban SUV stereotype. Later, the Hummer H3 toned things down a bit, and then the brand died out entirely.\nNow, in the age of the General Motors Ultium EV platform, the Hummer is back, this time branded as a GMC and an electric car. It's bigger, heavier, faster, and way sillier than any Hummer from the past. Given the brand's history, my overall obsession with weird GM products, and the Hummer's reputation, I was eager to try out the greener Hummer of the 2020s.\nStomping around\nI was tasked with stomping around Pennsylvania and Maryland in a 2025 GMC Hummer 3X SUV. The EV Hummer first launched as a truck, reminiscent of the Chevy Avalanche and Cadillac Escalade EXT. Later, it was given the big SUV treatment, fit for all of your sports-utility needs.\nUnder the \"hood\" (well, not quite, but you know what I mean), it rides on the \"electric skateboard\" architecture that is shared with the Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV. It has a three motor electric drive system that throws down 830 horsepower to all four wheels. That number makes the Hummer EV the highest horsepower and most powerful car I have ever driven.\nThat same electric platform allows all four wheels to steer, a feature GMC will never let you forget is called \"Crabwalk,\" athropod iconography and all. On the realistic end, it does allow the Hummer to have a surprisingly small turn radius given its size. \"Crabwalking\" lets the Hummer to drive diagonally, but more on that later.\nImpossible to ignore\nImmediately upon delivery, the Hummer made itself known. It's wider than most of the parking spots in my apartment complex, and it's a full several feet taller than just about every other vehicle in a significant radius. The front windshield has three wiper blades. I'm fairly tall, and the Hummer was towering over me. The huge \"grille\" lights spell out \"HUMMER\" with illumination bright enough to signal aircraft (and you could probably land a small plane on the roof). The wheels look like they could fit on an armored personnel carrier, and take a shot from an anti-tank rifle and keep going.\nHoisting myself into the seat and behind the steering wheel, I was greeted with a frankly confusing interior. The Hummer is billed as a supertruck, in the same vein as the similarly angular Tesla Cybertruck and Rivian R1S. You'd expect an interior to match the attention grabbing exterior, but that was not the case. It was actually fairly pedestrian.\nLackluster interior\nAside from the military-esque buttons that cover nearly every surface, the interior really isn't that impressive. It doesn't have leather seats and you feel like you're sitting inside of a coffin with how relatively cramped it is, despite the outside dimensions. At the same time, you and the front seat passenger are seated in a way that it feels like you're miles apart.\nIt's deeply weird. As far as comfort is concerned, the inside feels somewhere between a PlaySkool car and a run of the mill Chevy SUV; that's to say, it wasn't hateful, but it definitely didn't match the definition of plush like the Escalade IQ. Unlike the rest of the vehicle, the Hummer's interior really didn't stand out at all. There is a larger \"Sign and Signified\" debate here on what the Hummer represents as a vehicle versus what it actually is. However, I know that most people want me to talk about the crabwalking monster of an SUV.\nCrabwalking into town\nThe Hummer's Crustacean-based party trick is arguably its best-known feature. I refer to it as a \"trick\" because I cannot think of a practical application for crab-walking, apart from some very specific parking scenarios and whether or not you think mildly scaring your passengers as a \"practical application.\" I gave a lot of friends and family rides in the Hummer as it attracted more attention than most other vehicles I've reviewed, and everyone wanted to see it crab walk. Most people immediately thought it was cool, if a little bit freaky that an office building of an SUV was driving diagonally. I try to keep my cynicism at the door when reviewing cars and I even thought it was a hilarious feature.\nCrab-walking brings up my major problem with the Hummer and that's practicality. On paper, it's monstrously capable, with more power than most other cars on the road, huge mud tires, skid plates everywhere, auxiliary power ports, and lot of little cubbies and storage compartments for all of your stuff. It's billed as an off-road vehicle and I have no concerns about whether or not it can tackle tough terrain.\nHowever\u2013and this is a big \"however\"\u2013when was the last time you saw an electric car charger out in the middle of the desert or tundra the Hummer presumably calls home? It's well known that EV powertrains and battery systems don't always perform the best in cold weather. The 300 miles of estimated range on the battery according to General Motors was conservative in my estimate, and that figure was significantly lower in the cold weather of Maryland and Pennsylvania.\nA land-missile\nPerformance-wise, it's a rocket. GMC says it will do the zero to 60 sprint in 3.5 seconds. Those are sports car numbers and nearly a full second faster than GM's other super-SUV, the resolutely gas-guzzling Cadillac Escalade V-Series. It's also important to note that the Hummer weighs north of 8,500 pounds.\nIt's the automotive equivalent of a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser moving at the speed of sound. I'll leave the discussion of moving that much weight, that quickly, in populated areas between you and your moral framework, but it's definitely something to consider. It fits into the same conversation of ridiculous vehicles like the aforementioned Escalade, the Tesla Cybertruck, and about a dozen other big, heavy, and really fast SUVs.\nHonestly speaking, I can't think of a way that speed would be of service to anyone in any application apart from pulling off from a stoplight to scare the kid parked next to you in a Bullitt Ford Mustang.\nAll the self-satisfaction money can buy\nNow, there's the price. It's not inexpensive. You already knew that, and Hummer fans from two decades ago already knew that. To break it down, the 2025 GMC Hummer 3X SUV starts at $104,650. For that, you get the self-satisfaction of owning a vehicle that will likely gain the admiration of a very select few people and the confused looks and scoffs of much more. The Hummer I had was equipped with the \"Extreme Off-Road Package\" which, GMC admitted, has a notable impact on the range. I'm no engineer or scientist, but I can imagine that 35-inch mud tires aren't great for efficiency.\nThe off-road package also gives you skid plates, rear and front locking differentials, underbody cameras, and rock guards. It's a $9,995 option. This particular SUV was bedazzled in $625 \"Meteorite Metallic\" paint and came with a $350 charging cord. Add in the destination charge of $2,295, and you're looking at $117,915.\nThe Hummer is big, expensive, fast, and probably extremely capable in specific scenarios. It's also really goofy, completely impractical if you want to actually take it anywhere \"off-the-grid,\" lacks a special interior, and is full of features that don't have any real benefit apart from looking like something from the Decopada order of invertebrates.\n2025 GMC Hummer EV SUV Verdict\nI honestly wasn't thrilled with the EV Hummer. I like big, outlandish vehicles and I like EVs, but the combination that is the Hummer wasn't executed in a way that was seriously compelling outside of sheer spectacle. In a lot of categories, there a better vehicles than the GMC. As it turns out, you can in fact have too much of a good thing: the Hummer is too big, too fast, too goofy, too expensive, and too heavy.\nIn fact, I don't really know what the Hummer is for, exactly. If you just want to make everyone mad with a car, get a Cybertruck; if you want a huge General Motors branded off-roader, there's roughly a century's worth of vehicles to choose from. If you want a capable electric SUV with decent range, the Ford Mach-E, Tesla Model Y, and Kia EV9 will fit the bill. For something so big, and launched with such fanfare, I'm just not sure where the Hummer fits apart from its own extremely tiny niche."

      "text": "Everything You Need To Know About GM's Ultium EV Platform\nGeneral Motors developed its scalable EV architecture called Ultium so that it could build dedicated electric vehicles that didn't use existing internal combustion engine vehicle platforms. Most manufacturers have either launched or are working on a bespoke EV platform because this is a key step in being able to offer electric models with competitive range and performance numbers.\nUltium isn't a platform in the same sense as defined by other manufacturers. Usually, the image of a skateboard containing the battery pack, motors, and electronics is conjured up when talking about an EV platform, but that's not the case with Ultium.\nGM puts its Ultium EV tech in a variety of vehicles with different frame sizes, ranging from regular-sized models such as the Chevrolet Blazer EV to the body-on-frame GMC Hummer EV. It even powers the BrightDrop Zevo 600 electric van. All of these vehicles have Ultium batteries, motors, controllers, and all the other vital electronics, but the platforms themselves are not related.\nNot following the industry trend of tying its EV tech to a single platform, GM is allowing itself the freedom to implement it in a broader spectrum of vehicles. Back in 2020, when it officially unveiled Ultium, GM said it was envisioning as many as 19 different battery and drive unit combinations for various applications in front-, rear-, and all-wheel drive vehicles of different sizes.\nBatteries\nThe most important part of the Ultium package is the batteries. They feature cylindrical cells, like the one in your laptop battery, each capable of storing 0.37 kWh of energy, and they are usually arranged in 24-cell modules (with the cells either vertical or horizontal depending on the space constraints of the application), totaling 8.9 kWh.\nThese cells have a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry, and they can be found in all Ultium vehicles. You'll find them in the Chevy Blazer EV's battery pack, as well as in the GMC Hummer EV's battery pack. The Blazer EV's smaller 85-kWh battery pack is comprised of 10 battery modules, while the larger 105-kWh pack has 12 modules.\nThe 212-kWh pack in the Hummer EV is wired in a very complicated way, and it features 24 modules. The electric Hummer is the only Ultium EV that can run on 800 volts (only during charging), which enables it to accept 350 kW charging and add 100 miles of range in 10 minutes.\nAll other vehicles with Ultium batteries except the Hummer run on 400 volts, so they won't charge any faster than 200 kW, even if you plug them into a 350-kW charging station.\nOne cool feature of Ultium batteries is that GM has implemented a wireless battery management and monitoring system, which not only keeps an eye on cell health but can also be used to implement changes when the manufacturer launches updates.\nGM was one of the first manufacturers to implement this, starting in 2022, and it has enabled cost savings in the manufacturing process of the battery pack, since it doesn't require each cell to be physically connected to be monitored.\nMotors\nGeneral Motors has created three different motors (known as drive units) to use in its Ultium vehicles: a permanent magnet motor for front-wheel drive applications, a larger motor of the same type for use in front- and rear-wheel drive vehicles, and a smaller induction motor that can be on the front or back to serve an assist function. These motors are used in various combinations in GM Ultium vehicles, depending on the model or trim level.\nThe top-of-the-range Chevy Blazer EV SS packs a dual-motor configuration with a combined rating of 557 horsepower. It uses one of the smaller permanent magnet motors to drive the front wheels and a larger one for the rear, and it can accelerate to 60 mph from a standstill in under 4 seconds. One quirk of the Ultium architecture is that it allows GM to offer models like the Blazer EV with front-, rear-, and all-wheel drive. This is unusual in the automotive sphere, since specific car models are usually either front- or all-wheel drive, and rear- or all-wheel drive.\nPowering the top version of the GMC Hummer EV is a trio of Ultium electric motors. One in the front, and two in the rear. Together, they make 1,000 horsepower and give the 9,000-pound Hummer alarming straight-line performance \u2014 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds.\nModels\nGeneral Motors launched the Hummer EV in 2021 as the first in its line of Ultium EVs, followed by the BrightDrop Zevo 600 that same year. Cadillac introduced the elegant Lyriq electric crossover in 2022, and 2023 saw the arrival of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Blazer EV models. Buick also introduced two Ultium-based EVs in China, the Electra E4 and Electra E5, with no announced plans to offer them in America.\nNext year will mark the debut of the Acura ZDX and Honda Prologue EVs, both of which are Ultium-based electric models built on the GM BEV3 platform shared with the Blazer EV. They will be manufactured in GM facilities in the US and Mexico, respectively. The fully electric Cadillac Escalade IQ is also set to debut in 2024, and production is also expected to commence for the very exclusive Cadillac Celestiq flagship EV and the GMC Sierra EV Denali.\nAll these models are part of GM's massive $35 billion investment in electric vehicles, which the manufacturer expects to produce 30 new global EVs by the middle of the decade."
