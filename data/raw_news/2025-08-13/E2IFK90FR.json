  "content": "A crushing night in Indianapolis ended with what appeared to be a heated moment between Caitlin Clark and a referee.\n\nWith the Fever trailing the Wings by one point Tuesday with less than two seconds to go in regulation, Indiana guard Kelsey Mitchell hurled the ball toward the net for the win but clipped the backboard instead.\n\nAs the Wings celebrated the 81-80 road victory inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Clark \u2014 currently sidelined with a groin injury \u2014 walked on the court toward official Amy Bonner, with images of the interaction seemingly illustrating a chippy exchange, in which the ref appeared to point toward the bench.\n\nClark, who isn\u2019t a stranger to jawing with the refs, wasn\u2019t the only member of the Fever who appeared to take exception to the officiating Tuesday, with head coach Stephanie White chiding the \u201cdouble standard\u201d in a physical game.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to be physical, and you\u2019re going to allow us to be physical, then allow both teams to be physical. If you\u2019re going to call the holds, and you\u2019re going to call the chucks, then call it both ways, White said, according to the Indy Star. \u201cSo, I mean, I think that we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in what we\u2019re asking for, and I didn\u2019t feel like it was consistent,\u201d\n\nWhite, in her first season as coach of the Fever, \u201cwent up to the referees multiple times during breaks and timeouts to talk and get clarity on different foul calls,\u201d per the Indy Star.\n\nAliyah Boston, the Fever\u2019s first overall pick in 2023, tallied three fouls Tuesday, including a questionable call involving Wings center Li Yueru, who clamped the Fever star\u2019s arm, which became entangled in her own as she made a shot.\n\nThe Fever fell to 18-15 with the loss and are sixth in the WNBA standings.\n\nClark, the reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year, has been hampered by injuries during her sophomore campaign.\n\nShe has been out since July 15, and there is no concrete timetable as to when she\u2019ll return.\n\nThrough 13 games this season, Clark has averaged 16.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 8.8 assists.\n\nThe Fever return to action Friday against the Mystics.",

Good conversations, as I\u2019ve mentioned before. The information that we\u2019re getting is that he is moving in the direction of practicing today. We\u2019ll see in a few minutes here, but that\u2019s the information that we\u2019ve got.\u201d\nNow the Bills, who have Super Bowl aspirations once again, have a crucial piece of their offense back, led by quarterback Josh Allen.\nCook had a breakout season in 2024 when he rushed for 16 touchdowns to complement a second straight 1,000-yard campaign."

      "text": "Caitlin Clark shook her head with her hands on her hips, disgusted by what had just transpired.\nA quick exchange with referee Michael Price during the Fever\u2019s 85-77 win over the Sun on Tuesday night left the Fever\u2019s star outraged and wanting to give him even more of her mind.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just rude. Grow up,\u201d Clark said before summoning Price with a finger point during the third quarter. \u201cCome here. Unbelievable.\u201d\nWhile the main storyline out of Tuesday\u2019s game would eventually be the re-injured groin that raises questions about Clark\u2019s availability for Wednesday\u2019s anticipated matchup against the Liberty and following the upcoming WNBA All-Star break, her hot-mic spat with the referee went viral.\nClark is not one to shy away from telling referees her two cents, which has led to technical fouls during her career, and it certainly seemed she gave Price plenty more change.\nWith the Fever leading, 54-49, with 4:33 left in the third quarter at TD Garden in Boston, the Sun invoked a coach\u2019s challenge on a ball that went out of bounds.\nWhile the players left the court, Clark gave an earful to Price.\nClark and Price exchanged words, with the guard appearing confused for a second, before she exploded when he walked away from her.\nA Fever staffer held back Clark while she screamed at the referee.\nOne of the ESPN broadcasters said Clark had been saying, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\nHot mics then captured Clark\u2019s anger, before she walked toward the referee.\nClark motioned as if she had a telephone in her right hand, putting it to ear while saying something that included the words \u201ccall.\u201d\nThe pair then huddled, with Clark getting in her point across before Price responded. He eventually walked away, with Clark pointing toward him before heading toward the Indiana bench.\nClark somehow did not earn a technical foul, and she helped the Fever win despite an off night. She tallied 14 points on 4-of-14 shooting, including 1-for-7 from deep.\nHer night took a turn for the worse when she exited in the final minute due to the groin injury.\nFever coach Stephanie White said Clark will be evaluated, but it could per her status in doubt for this weekend\u2019s 3-point shooting challenge.\nClark has already missed 10 games this year \u2014 a pair of five-game stretches \u2014 due to a quad and groin injury after never missing a game during her college and high school career.\nWhite noted during her postgame presser that Clark faces physicality that others rarely encounter.\n\u201cI knew it as an opponent, and I see it as her coach,\u201d White said after her team improved to 12-10. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure why, but it just is what it is. We\u2019ve got to help her learn to adjust and use it against them in certain ways. We\u2019ve got to find some ways to make it a little bit easier for her, but the level of physicality overall in our league has been at a different level than it\u2019s been for a long time.\u201d"

      "text": "It seems that the Fever will not have Caitlin Clark back on the court for a few more weeks, according to an ESPN report.\nHolly Rowe said during a report on Sunday\u2019s nationally televised broadcast of the Fever-Sky game that the third week in August could provide the best circumstances for the WNBA superstar to return.\nClark has dealt with several injury issues this season, most recently suffering a right groin injury on July 15 against the Sun, which was the last game she has played in.\n\u201c[Clark] did see a specialist last week and no additional injury was found in that exam and scans. Stephanie White did tell us that they will be even more cautious in their approach to her return to play this time,\u201d Rowe said on air. \u201cLast time when she came back from injury, she didn\u2019t get any practice time [or] any time to ramp up her conditioning. This time, they\u2019re going to make sure she has time and practices to get rhythm and time with her teammates.\n\u201cAs you look at their schedule, the third week in August provides a few more practice days where that seems like it\u2019s realistic. While she does remain day to day, that\u2019s seems like a better timetable for a possible Caitlin Clark return.\u201d\nSunday was the fourth straight game the 2024 Rookie of the Year has missed due to injury and her 13th game this season that an ailment has kept her off the court.\nWhile Clark didn\u2019t play, she was on hand for the game, which is an often-anticipated event when the Clark-led Fever and Angel Reese\u2019s Sky square off against one another. Reese, who is dealing with a back injury, also did not play\nVideo from inside the arena showed Clark mobbed by fans looking for autographs before the game and the women\u2019s basketball talent signing for what appeared like every fan.\nSports broadcaster Kylen Mills reported on X that Clark signed autographs for fans for 20 minutes in Chicago.\n\u201cShe made her way around 2/3rd of the arena, at one point security staff tried to shuffle her into the tunnel but she kept going,\u201d Mills reported.\nThe Fever defeated the Sky 93-78."

      "text": "Indiana Fever coach Stephanie White calls out referees' \u2018double standard\u2019 after loss to Wings\nINDIANAPOLIS -- The referees had a \"double standard\" in officiating the Indiana Fever's loss to the Dallas Wings on Tuesday night, Fever coach Stephanie White said.\nThe comments came after a particularly physical game, in which the Fever (18-15) roared back from a 17-point deficit but couldn't get the final shot to go down, resulting in an 81-80 loss to the Wings (9-24).\n\"There's a double standard there, certainly,\" White said. \"But, you know, if it's going to be physical, and you're going to allow us to be physical, then allow both teams to be physical. If you're going to call the holds, and you're going to call the chucks, then call it both ways. So, I mean, I think that we've been pretty consistent in what we're asking for, and I didn't feel like it was consistent.\"\nWhite's frustration was evident on Tuesday night, as she went up to the referees multiple times during breaks and timeouts to talk and get clarity on different foul calls.\nHer frustration boiled over when she initiated a challenge on a foul on Aliyah Boston; Dallas forward Li Yueru clamped Boston's arm with her elbow as she was going for the ball, then continued to drag her arm around as she went up for a shot. In that quick sequence, Boston wasn't able to get her arm out of Yueru's grip.\nStill, even after review, officials maintained the shooting foul on Boston.\n\"I think Aliyah Boston is the worst officiated post player in the league,\u201d White said. \u201cShe never gets a call. And, you know, there's a double standard there, certainly.\"\nThe officials also had questionable consistency on two flagrant reviews on Tuesday night. The first one came just two minutes into the game, as Dallas guard Paige Bueckers landed on Sophie Cunningham's foot after jumping for a 3-point attempt. That call was upgraded to a flagrant 1 foul; Bueckers got three free throws and Dallas got the ball back.\nA similar situation came up in the fourth quarter when Dallas guard Grace Berger landed on Kelsey Mitchell's foot after a 3-point attempt from Mitchell. In both cases, the defender impeded the landing space, and the shooter fell to the ground. But Berger was not called for a flagrant foul, with the officials telling the scorer's table it was because Mitchell landed on two feet before Berger landed on Mitchell's foot.\n\"I think Kelsey Mitchell, No. 1, is held or chucked on every freaking possession and never gets a call off the ball,\" White said.\nThis isn't the first time White has called out the refs this season. She said the refs lost control of the game on June 17 when there were six technicals and three ejections in a Fever win over the Connecticut Sun, and passionately voiced her displeasure with a series of calls that led to a last-second Liberty win over the Fever on May 24.\nIn a press conference ahead of the All-Star Game in Indianapolis, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said league officiating is something they \"continue to work on,\" and that there is an independent evaluation of officials throughout the season."
