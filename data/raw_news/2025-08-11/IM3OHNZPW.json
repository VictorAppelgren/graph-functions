  "title": "An Intrinsic Calculation For UWC Berhad (KLSE:UWC) Suggests It's 50% Undervalued",
  "description": "KLSE:UWC 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore UWC Berhad's Fair Values from the Community and select yours Key...",
  "content": "Explore UWC Berhad's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\u2022 The projected fair value for UWC Berhad is RM5.36 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 UWC Berhad is estimated to be 50% undervalued based on current share price of RM2.70\n\u2022 Analyst price target for UWC is RM2.80 which is 48% below our fair value estimate How far off is UWC Berhad (KLSE:UWC) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early. We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = RM1.7b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.9%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= RM11b\u00f7 ( 1 + 9.9%)10= RM4.2b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is RM5.9b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of RM2.7, the company appears quite good value at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UWC Berhad as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.046. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. See our latest analysis for UWC Berhad\n\u2022 Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\u2022 Debt is well covered by earnings.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Malaysian market.\n\u2022 Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\u2022 Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\u2022 Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year. Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For UWC Berhad, we've put together three essential factors you should look at:\n\u2022 Risks: You should be aware of the 2 warning signs for UWC Berhad (1 can't be ignored!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does UWC's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

  "summary": "An Intrinsic Calculation for UWC Berhad (KLSE:UWC) suggests that the company is undervalued by 50% based on its intrinsic value. The projected fair value for the firm is RM5.36 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, and the current share price of RM2.70 is estimated to be 50% undervalued. The analysis uses the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to discount future cash flows to their present value. This analysis uses a 2-stage model, which combines two periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. The Terminal Value accounts for all future cash flow after this period, using a conservative growth rate and a conservative 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.7%) to estimate future growth. The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cashflows, which is divided by the number of shares outstanding. Despite these assumptions, the company appears to be quite good value at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently.",
