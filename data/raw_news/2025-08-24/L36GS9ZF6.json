  "content": "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 For President Donald Trump, the map of Ukraine on an easel in the Oval Office had an obvious message. Russia has taken a big chunk of territory in an eastern region known as the Donbas. That territory, shaded in red, was gone. Ukraine needed to make a deal to get peace, or it risked losing more.\n\nFor President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, the map, displayed at a meeting Monday with the two presidents and European leaders, presented a far more complicated picture. This was not a business deal or a poker game. This was personal.\n\nAway from the cameras, he told Trump that his grandfather had fought in World War II to free the cities of the Donbas from the Nazis. He could not just give it up.\n\nOn Wednesday, hours after he returned to Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital, Zelenskyy reiterated the point.\n\n\u201cThere were many such families\u201d who fought to free the Donbas, Zelenskyy told reporters. \u201cMany fell and many were wounded. And I explained that this is a particularly painful moment in our history and a particularly painful part of life in Ukraine. It is not as simple as it may appear to some.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear where exactly the recent flurry of diplomacy spearheaded by Trump to end the deadliest war in Europe since World War II will lead. But the Donbas \u2014 a mineral-rich territory that consists mainly of two regions, Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 will be at the center of any negotiations.\n\nAlmost the size of West Virginia, the Donbas is where much of this war has been fought. Tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides have died there for the smallest of gains. Russia is now trying to seize the last 2,500 square miles of the Donbas still under Ukrainian control.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin of Russia has demanded that Ukraine give up all of the Donbas. His demand includes even the part run by Kyiv, where more than 200,000 Ukrainians live in cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, places Zelenskyy\u2019s grandfather fought to defend.\n\nFor years, Putin has tried to use the Donbas to manipulate the Ukrainian government. Before invading, he exploited a Russian-backed insurgency in the region as a wedge against Ukraine\u2019s hopes to join Western organizations like NATO. And now, in the fourth year of this war, he wants to not just seize the Donbas, but to use it to politically torpedo Zelenskyy, analysts said.\n\nMost Ukrainians still oppose ceding any territory to Russia, polls show, and the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits surrendering it. Zelenskyy faces the choice of either supporting something unpopular with Ukrainians or risking Trump\u2019s ire.\n\n\u201cIt is a poison pill,\u201d said Vadym Prystaiko, a former foreign affairs minister. \u201cUkraine will have to swallow it and then we\u2019ll see how Ukraine will digest it.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy has avoided questions from journalists about whether he would give up land, saying he could discuss this issue only with Putin, who has not yet agreed to meet him.\n\nFormer Ukrainian officials and political analysts said the only way Zelenskyy could convince Ukrainians to cede territory would be to deliver an American-backed security guarantee. That has eluded Ukraine since Trump ruled out NATO membership.\n\nBut the guarantee would have to be strong, with some mixture of European troops and U.S. air support, for example, that would deter Russia from future attacks.\n\nBalazs Jarabik, a former political adviser for the European Union in Kyiv, said Ukraine may have reached a point where it could accept ceding territory \u201cfor a peace deal which brings Western security guarantees for Ukraine.\u201d He added, \u201cIf in exchange, it should get rid of the Donbas, I think it would.\u201d\n\nTrump has framed these territorial concessions as \u201cland swaps,\u201d suggesting that Russia, which controls nearly 20% of Ukraine, might return some territory, possibly small slivers of land in northeastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Trump administration believes \u201cthat these land swaps are really beneficial for Ukraine because they believe Donbas will fall soon, and then Ukraine will have no cards to negotiate further,\u201d said Maksym Skrypchenko, the president of the Transatlantic Dialogue Center, a research group in Kyiv.\n\nUkrainians see it differently, he added. Russia\u2019s advance in the region has been slow over the past three years. Giving up the rest of the Donbas now would also mean handing over cities and fortifications that could help Russia begin a future invasion.\n\nThe Donbas used to be seen as a pro-Russian backwater. Many of the 6.7 million residents spoke only Russian and no Ukrainian, and 9 out of 10 people voted for a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2010.\n\nWhen pro-European protests forced Yanukovych to resign in early 2014, Russia reacted swiftly. First it seized the Crimean Peninsula. Then it fomented separatist movements which, with the help of Russian troops, seized a third of the Donbas in a low-scale conflict that foreshadowed the current war.\n\nUkraine\u2019s government considered granting self-government to certain areas of the Donbas to settle the conflict after a peace accord negotiated in February 2015 in Belarus, although Putin wanted any autonomous Donbas to have veto power over Kyiv, especially over its hopes to join NATO.\n\n\u201cThe point was to turn Ukraine into a country which could not exercise its full sovereignty, especially when it came to its foreign policy,\u201d said Harry Nedelcu, a senior director at Rasmussen Global, a research organization.\n\nAs negotiations dragged on, Zelenskyy, a political novice, ran for Ukrainian president in 2019 on the promise of bringing peace with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy won. Back then, he was open to the idea of a compromise and granting \u201cspecial status\u201d to the Donbas region. He thought he could make a deal to end the war at a peace summit in Paris with Putin in December 2019. But at home, he faced political pressure to avoid any deal that would relinquish Ukrainian control over the Donbas.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like you could get along\u201d with the Russians, said Ihor Novikov, a presidential adviser at the time, noting that Moscow had agreed to prisoner swaps and seemed interested in negotiating.\n\n\u201cAs soon as that meeting in Paris happened, I think Zelenskyy was actually the first person to realize that you can\u2019t make a deal with Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he did a U-turn in Paris, and it angered Putin.\u201d\n\nIn February 2022, Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, chewing up cities in the Donbas and driving millions from their homes. Shocked by the invasion, Zelenskyy appeared to reconsider granting some form of autonomy to the Donbas.\n\n\u201cWe can discuss and find a compromise on how these territories will live on,\u201d he told ABC News a week into the invasion.\n\nBut after Ukrainian troops pushed back Russian forces, and after mass slaughters of Ukrainian civilians became public, his views changed again. He pushed for Ukraine to reclaim the Donbas, even the parts Russia had seized before the invasion.\n\nJarabik, now an analyst at R. Politik, a political analysis firm in Europe, said Ukraine then shifted from that position, embodied in the bloody battle to keep the city of Bakhmut. It began making slow retreats after long fights that forced Russia to lose many soldiers.\n\nUkraine was \u201cessentially trading territory for Russian lives,\u201d Jarabik said.\n\nAs Russia pushed on the battlefield, Zelenskyy for the first time last fall talked about the idea of temporarily ceding occupied territory to Russia in exchange for the security guarantee of joining NATO.\n\nBut in a win for Zelenskyy, Trump said last week that the United States would participate in security guarantees for Ukraine. Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state and national security adviser, is leading efforts to work out the details.\n\nWhether Russia would accept such guarantees is the real question. Ukraine wants NATO-like protections, but Russia started the war in the Donbas a decade ago in part to block Kyiv\u2019s path to NATO. Why would Russia allow serious security guarantees now?\n\n\u201cSo basically, we\u2019re back to square one,\u201d said Nedelcu, the analyst from Rasmussen Global. Unless a change is forced on Putin, he said, \u201cnothing will happen\u201d with the peace talks in the near future. Instead, he added, \u201cI see more fighting happening.\u201d",

      "text": "Vladimir Putin came to Alaska and got the red-carpet treatment, complete with a fighter jet flyover and a warm presidential handshake. The state was an ironic location for a summit, given Russia\u2019s continuing seller\u2019s remorse over having sold it to America in the mid-19th century. While expectations were low for a full ceasefire, most observers were hoping for at least a path to negotiations.\nBut as he has for months now, Putin simply continued to play rope-a-dope like a boxer in the ring, ducking both a ceasefire or even a demonstrated willingness to negotiate. A subdued President Donald Trump canceled a planned luncheon to discuss broader economic and security issues with Russia, uncharacteristically refused to take questions and flew back to D.C. to ponder next steps.\nClearly, it\u2019s going to take \u201csevere measures,\u201d to use Trump\u2019s own words, to get Moscow not to just sit at the bargaining table but stay for dinner. But what measures need to be up for discussion to convince the maximalist Putin to reduce his demands? Is there a specific checklist?\nOrdered in ascending amount of pain for Moscow, here are 10 options the White House, acting in concert with European allies, should strongly consider:\nIncrease the number of F-16 aircraft to Ukraine to at least 100.\nThis would be triple the number of Ukrainians undergoing fighter training and provide commensurate air-to-air, air-to-ground and electronic warfare capabilities. This should be done by a joint U.S.-European Union task force under the direction of the supreme allied commander of NATO.\nQuadruple the number of long-range, surface-to-surface weapons provided to Ukraine.\nThe U.S. High Mobility Artillery Rocket System is the gold standard, but European defense forces also have powerful capabilities in this area. Assign this to the EU as lead, with purchases of both U.S. and European weapons in the mix.\nProvide highly precise targeting intelligence for these missiles to Ukraine, with a detailed focus on Russian logistics systems.\nThe U.S. has spent decades studying how to reverse-engineer military logistic chains to find the critical nodes and destroy them, rendering the supply chain useless. Assign this targeting effort to a combined task force of U.S. Transportation Command and U.S. Strategic Command, both run by two combat commanders with deep experience.\nBegin sharing technology and hardware of unmanned vehicles among the EU, U.S. and Ukraine.\nPut particular emphasis on maritime unmanned systems (air, surface and subsurface). Target the remaining ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Use the U.S. Navy\u2019s expert Task Force 59, based in the Persian Gulf, which has experimented with maritime unmanned warfare extensively.\nConfiscate the $300 billion in Russian assets in Western banks, including the $10 billion in U.S. institutions.\nThen, use the money to set up a trust fund, of which the profits are applied to Ukrainian military spending in perpetuity. Have a joint U.S.-EU team of expert financiers manage the investment of the funds, the way that the board of directors at a large foundation does.\nImmediately apply secondary sanctions on global purchases of Russian oil and gas.\nThese must be universally placed on any nation doing business, including China. Track and impound the Russian \u201cshadow fleet\u201d that is engaged in such activities, with an eye toward confiscating at least 10 such tankers each month.\nProvide NATO-like security guarantees to Ukraine (but without fully bringing them formally into the alliance).\nExpand NATO cooperation with every element of the Ukrainian military, especially through the NATO Centers of Excellence, e.g. NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense in Tallinn, Estonia; Air Operations in Lyon, France; and Maritime Security in Istanbul.\nSend European military training and advisory troops into Ukraine.\nTarget an initial force of 5,000 experts, with self-protection capability working at all levels (with higher priority than that of tactical, front-line) with the Ukrainian military. Focus on intelligence, unmanned vehicle warfare, cybersecurity, maritime warfare and logistics. This would be an EU military mission akin to the counter-piracy or Balkan security efforts the European\u2019s routinely execute.\nPlan and execute a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\nIt would be defensive in nature, but include air assets for every NATO nation and operate under the control of the supreme allied commander of the alliance through a task force set up at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. About 100 combat aircraft, including the dedicated NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control System (E-3 Sentry) force, would help maintain the zone.\nFormally admit Ukraine into the NATO Alliance.\nObviously, this would be a \u201cnuclear option,\u201d and there would be difficulty getting it through the NATO formal process. (Look at the one-year delay to admit Finland and Sweden, the ultimate no-brainers.) But as the ultimate threat to Putin, it would be powerful.\nAs Trump and his team consider their options to put sufficient pressure on Putin, the items on this list could be initially threatened and deployed one by one as necessary. And certainly, Ukraine conceding some of its territory already in Russian hands would have to be part of a final agreement. There are carrots as well as sticks to be used on Moscow, including sanctions relief and the return of their funds. But more sticks appear to be needed to get Putin to make a deal.\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com/opinion. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."

      "text": "BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A Ukrainian man suspected to be one of the coordinators of undersea explosions that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines between Russia and Germany in 2022 was arrested in Italy on Thursday, authorities said.\nThe 49-year-old was detained in the early hours in San Clemente, a village inland from Italy\u2019s Adriatic coast and 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the resort of Rimini, after Italian authorities were alerted to his possible presence in the country, police in Italy said.\nOfficers raided a bungalow where the suspect was staying with his family for a few days. Police said he surrendered without resistance.\nThe man was detained on a European arrest warrant that was issued Monday by German authorities. German federal prosecutors identified him only as Serhii K. in line with local privacy rules.\nHe was taken to jail in Rimini after his arrest. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how soon he might be handed over to German authorities.\nUndersea explosions on Sept. 26, 2022, damaged pipelines that were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The damage added to tensions over the war in Ukraine as European countries moved to wean themselves off Russian energy sources, following the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nProsecutors have given little detail so far on their investigation, but said two years ago they found traces of undersea explosives in samples taken from a yacht that was searched as part of the probe.\nIn a statement Thursday, German prosecutors said Serhii K. was one of a group of people who placed explosives on the pipelines and is believed to have been one of the coordinators. They said he is suspected of causing explosions, anti-constitutional sabotage and the destruction of structures.\nThe suspect and others used a yacht that set off from the German port of Rostock, which had been hired from a German company using forged IDs and with the help of intermediaries, prosecutors said.\nThey didn\u2019t give any information on the other people aboard the yacht or say anything about who else might have been involved in coordinating the suspected sabotage, or about a possible motive.\nGerman Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig praised what she called \u201ca very impressive investigative success.\u201d She said in a statement that the explosions must be cleared up, \u201cso it is good that we are making progress.\u201d\nThe explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which was Russia\u2019s main natural gas supply route to Germany until Moscow cut off supplies at the end of August 2022.\nThey also damaged the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which never entered service because Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in February of that year.\nRussia has accused the U.S. of staging the explosions, a charge Washington has denied. The pipelines were long a target of criticism by the U.S. and some of its allies, who warned that they posed a risk to Europe\u2019s energy security by increasing dependence on Russian gas.\nIn 2023, German media reported that a pro-Ukraine group was involved in the sabotage. Ukraine rejected suggestions it might have ordered the attack and German officials voiced caution over the accusation.\nSwedish and Danish authorities closed their investigations in February 2024, leaving the German prosecutors\u2019 case as the sole probe.\n___\nGiada Zampano in Rome contributed to this report"

      "text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russia launched a rare drone and missile attack on western Ukraine overnight, officials said Thursday, striking targets including an American-owned electronics plant and injecting further uncertainty into the U.S.-led efforts to end the 3-year-old war.\nThe aerial assault on a part of Ukraine that has largely not experienced such focused attacks was one of Russia\u2019s biggest this year and came as Moscow objects to key aspects of proposals that could end the fighting.\nU.S. President Donald Trump discussed the war with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last week before hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday.\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted \u201centerprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex,\u201d including drone factories, storage depots, missile launch sites and areas where Ukrainian troops were gathered. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilian areas of Ukraine.\nBut in a post on X, Zelenskyy wrote that \u201cthe Russians practically burned down an American company producing electronics \u2014 home appliances, nothing military.\u201d\n\u201cThe Russians knew exactly where they lobbed the missiles. We believe this was a deliberate attack against American property and investments in Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote, adding: \u201cTelling attack, right as the world awaits a clear answer from Russia on negotiations to end the war.\u201d\nTrump last month questioned Putin\u2019s commitment to ending the war, saying the Russian leader \u201ctalks nice and then he bombs everybody.\u201d\nIn a social media post Thursday, Trump criticized his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not providing Ukraine with more weaponry it needs to \u201cfight back.\u201d\n\u201cIt is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offensive. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.\u201d\nThe White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Trump is considering changes to the types of weapons the U.S. will provide to Kyiv.\nThe push for peace\nRussia has fired nearly 1,000 long-range drones and missiles at Ukraine since Monday\u2019s White House talks, according to Ukrainian tallies.\nEuropean countries are discussing how they can deploy military assets to deter any postwar Russian assault on Ukraine. But the Kremlin won\u2019t accept the deployment of any troops from NATO countries, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday that making security arrangements for Ukraine without Moscow\u2019s involvement was pointless.\nPutin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy to discuss peace terms, Lavrov said Thursday, but only after key issues have been worked out by senior officials in what could be a protracted negotiating process because the two sides remain far apart.\nUkrainian and European leaders have accused Putin of stalling in the peace efforts in the hopes that his bigger army, which has been making slow advances, can capture more Ukrainian land.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a conference call Thursday with the national security advisers of European countries expected to play a role in future security guarantees for Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said. In addition to the national security advisers from Britain, Finland, France, Germany and Italy, officials from the European Commission and NATO also joined the call. The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to outline a discussion that had not been publicly announced.\nMilitary leaders from the U.S., Ukraine and these five European countries met Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington to work out military options, said Joseph Holstead, a spokesperson for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. His statement gave no details about what specifically was discussed at the meeting, which also included NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander in Europe.\nBut an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about the discussions said, \u201cEverything is being considered and nothing is being ruled out,\u201d regarding security guarantees for Ukraine, apart from U.S. boots on the ground.\nMilitary chiefs and their staffs are looking at a variety of options including \u201chow big\u201d the security guarantee is and what happens if it is implemented with or without a ceasefire, the official said, noting that European defense chiefs acknowledged its their \u201cresponsibility to secure Europe.\u201d\nThe Pentagon\u2019s policy chief, Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, attended meetings with European military leaders this week to personally convey that the U.S. military plans to play only a minimal role in any security guarantee for Ukraine, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in a statement.\nWestern Ukraine is struck\nRussia launched 574 drones and 40 ballistic and cruise missiles overnight, the Ukrainian air force said. The attack mostly targeted western regions of the country where much of the military aid provided by Ukraine\u2019s Western allies is believed to be delivered and stored. The strikes killed at least one person and injured 15 others, according to officials.\nA U.S. electronics plant near the Hungarian border was struck, according to Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine. The Flex factory is one of the biggest American investments in Ukraine, Hunder told The Associated Press.\nAt the moment of impact, 600 night shift workers were on the premises, and six were injured, Hunder said. Russian attacks on Ukraine since it launched its invasion have damaged property belonging to more than half of the chamber\u2019s roughly 600 members, he added\n\u201cThe message is clear: Russia is not looking for peace. Russia is attacking American business in Ukraine, humiliating American business,\u201d Hunder said.\nIn the western city of Lviv, one person was killed and three were injured as the attack damaged 26 residential buildings, a kindergarten and administrative buildings, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on Telegram.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump started the week declaring a diplomatic breakthrough in his bid to prod Moscow and Kyiv closer to peace, announcing he had begun arranging for direct talks between Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nFour days later, the Republican president\u2019s optimism has diminished. Russia\u2019s top diplomat made it clear Friday that Putin won\u2019t meet with Zelenskyy until the Ukrainians agree to some of Moscow\u2019s longstanding demands to end the conflict.\nIt\u2019s a stinging setback for Trump, who had been touting his diplomatic blitz as resulting in indisputable momentum for a deal to halt a conflict he vowed as a candidate to end on Day One in office.\nTrump said Friday he expected to make a decision on his next actions in two weeks if direct talks aren\u2019t scheduled. He raised the possibility of imposing new sanctions or tariffs on Russia, a threat he has previously floated but not followed through on.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see whether or not they have a meeting,\u201d Trump told reporters in an Oval Office appearance. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see. If they don\u2019t, why didn\u2019t they have a meeting, because I told them to have a meeting. But I\u2019ll know what I am going to do in two weeks.\u201d\nTrump has touted a breakthrough that wasn\u2019t\nTrump announced Monday that he had begun making the arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting soon after concluding White House talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders as well as speaking by phone with Putin.\nEuropean leaders cheered the president\u2019s tone at the White House meeting, when he made vague promises to back European security guarantees for postwar Ukraine.\nTrump also appeared to ease European anxiety heightened by his comments after his Alaska summit with Putin days earlier, when he appeared to tilt toward the Russian leader\u2019s demand for Ukraine to give up land seized by Russia. The European leaders even offered guarded optimism that Trump was making headway after he announced his plans for direct talks, followed potentially by three-way negotiations involving him.\nBut uncertainty has grown in recent days about Putin\u2019s commitment to Trump\u2019s peace-making efforts as Russian officials raised objections about cornerstones of the nascent proposals on the negotiating table.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy to discuss peace terms but only after key issues first are worked out by senior officials. That could involve a protracted negotiating process because the two sides remain far apart.\n\u201cThere is no meeting planned,\u201d Lavrov said in a taped interview for NBC\u2019s Sunday show \u201cMeet the Press with Kristen Welker.\u201d \u201cPutin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda is ready for a summit, and this agenda is not ready at all.\u201d\nRussia injects uncertainty into any headway on security guarantees\nUkraine wants Western security guarantees to deter any postwar Russian attack, and U.S. and European officials are scrambling to come up with detailed proposals of how that might work. But Lavrov said earlier this week that making security arrangements for Ukraine without Moscow\u2019s involvement was pointless.\nPutin, meanwhile, on Friday made a visit to Sarov, a closed city about 370 kilometers (230 miles) east of Moscow that has served as a base for Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons program since the late 1940s. The visit offered a not-so-subtle reminder that Russia is one of the world\u2019s foremost nuclear powers.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t moderated his position in any significant way,\u201d said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and former British ambassador to Belarus.\nEven as Trump touted his plan for peace talks, Russia on Thursday launched one of its biggest aerial assaults so far this year, focusing on western Ukraine in the barrage of 574 drones and 40 ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\u201cThe Russians are trying to do anything to avoid the (summit) meeting. The issue is not the meeting itself, the issue is that they do not want to end the war,\u201d Zelenskyy said Friday alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who was visiting Kyiv.\nRutte said Trump wants to \u201cbreak the deadlock\u201d with Putin and engage the United States in providing security guarantees for Ukraine.\nRutte explained that guarantees under discussion would rest on two \u201clayers.\u201d The first, to take place after a peace deal or long-term ceasefire, would focus on making the Ukrainian armed forces \u201cas strong as possible.\u201d The second would involve security commitments provided by Europe and the United States.\nEurope\u2019s chief diplomat warns of Putin \u2018trap\u2019\nThe European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief said Friday that the possibility of Ukraine ceding land to Russia as part of a peace deal to end their three-year war is \u201ca trap\u201d set by Putin.\nThe Russian leader is demanding Ukrainian concessions in return for halting his army\u2019s invasion, but granting him those demands would amount to rewarding the country that started the fighting, Kaja Kallas said.\nThe recent talk about handing Putin concessions is \u201cexactly the trap that Russia wants us to walk into,\u201d Kallas said in an interview with the BBC.\n\u201cI mean, the discussion all about what Ukraine should give up, what the concessions that Ukraine is willing to (make), whereas we are forgetting that Russia has not made one single concession and they are the ones who are the aggressor here, they are the ones who are brutally attacking another country and killing people,\u201d she said.\n\u201cRussia is just dragging feet. It\u2019s clear that Russia does not want peace,\u201d Kallas said. \u201cPresident Trump has been repeatedly saying that the killing has to stop and Putin is just laughing, not stopping the killing, but increasing the killing.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Emma Burrows in London contributed.\n___\nFollow the AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

      "text": "NEAR POKROVSK, Ukraine \u2014 On a map, the gains hardly seem noticeable, measured in hundreds of yards, not hundreds of miles. But as President Donald Trump presses Ukraine and Russia to make a deal to end their war, President Vladimir Putin of Russia is pushing to capture as much land as possible along a front line that stretches about 750 miles, almost the distance from Chicago to New York.\nAs ever growing swarms of surveillance drones make any movement on the battlefield dangerous, the Russians are sending in small groups of soldiers on foot who are harder to detect. They effectively sneak past the Ukrainian troops, regroup and then attack, repeating this cycle as they inch forward.\nThese groups gained some territory earlier this month, especially in the crucial eastern Donetsk region near the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Larger formations of Russian troops also outflanked some Ukrainian defenses with drones and sheer numbers, raising fears that the front line could start to crumble as the most concerted effort at peace talks in three years gets underway.\nUkrainian forces have largely pushed the Russians back from their recent gains and stabilized the front line after moving in reinforcements, according to interviews and battlefield maps. The fighting, however, remains intense. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, said Wednesday that Russian troops were stepping up their offensive actions in the north of Donetsk while continuing to push toward Pokrovsk.\n\u201cGiven that political negotiations and deals are starting to emerge, Putin is trying to use the short amount of time left to grab as much territory as he can,\u201d said Col. Dmytro Palisa, commander of Ukraine\u2019s 33rd Mechanized Brigade. His team recently moved to an area near Pokrovsk, which Russian troops have been trying to capture for more than a year.\nOn Sunday, he sat on a dark blue pleather couch inside a dugout near the fighting. Bombs could be heard in the distance. The makeshift room, built of plywood and netting, smelled like soil.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care how many Russian soldiers die or how much equipment is lost,\u201d Palisa said of Putin. \u201cWhat matters to him now is to seize as much of the Donetsk region as possible. This, in turn, could have a negative consequence for us, because it would force us to enter any negotiations from a weaker position.\u201d\nIt has been a long time since this was a fast-moving war. Russia gained much of the territory it now holds in 2014, when it seized the Crimean Peninsula and then fomented the proxy war that followed in eastern Ukraine, and in the early months after launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russia\u2019s control over Ukrainian territory has been close to 20% for the past year.\nBut recently, Ukrainian defenses along a front line running through the east and south of the country have at times flagged. Russian troops captured twice as much territory in May, after starting their spring offensive, than they had the month before.\nWhile the Ukrainian military has stemmed significant territorial losses, the most battle-hardened brigades are exhausted after being used to plug holes and engage in the most serious fighting wherever it exists.\nThe Azov brigade was recently moved to the Pokrovsk area, along with brigades like the 33rd and the 59th. Many soldiers have been fighting since 2022; some, since 2014. Despite a draft of all men ages 25 to 60, despite flashy billboard campaigns featuring soldiers riding giant cats, the Ukrainian army is having difficulty recruiting new soldiers. Last month, Ukraine even adopted a law allowing citizens older than 60 to voluntarily enlist.\nTo understand what is happening in the war, look no further than Donetsk, a focal point on the battlefield and in peace negotiations.\nPutin insists that Donetsk, which makes up the core of a historical area known as the Donbas, belongs rightfully in Russia. At his meeting with Trump in Alaska on Friday, Putin seemingly convinced the U.S. president that Ukraine needed to give up the entire Donbas to Russia to achieve peace.\nBut Russia controls only about three-quarters of Donetsk.\nIn the Ukrainian-controlled area of western Donetsk, roughly the size of Delaware, fighting is fierce. The small groups of soldiers that Russia is using, numbering two, three or four, have exploited gaps in the Ukrainian front line near the town of Dobropillia.\nIt is this area where drones and missiles are now pounding villages on a regular basis, destroying post offices and schools. It is where Russia has been unable to turn small gains on the battlefield into actual breakthroughs, despite suffering huge losses. And it is where Putin and Trump want Ukrainian soldiers to walk away, after an 11-year fight, in exchange for a peace deal.\nThe battlefield map maintained by DeepState, a Ukrainian group with ties to the military, shows Russian incursions growing in early August about 12 miles northeast of Pokrovsk, with small fingers of troops making gains to the west and the north.\nThis area has little strategic significance but definite opportunity. By Aug. 11, the Russians had pushed about 8.5 miles north in two long incursions that resembled rabbit ears, east of Dobropillia, the map showed.\nAnd then, on Aug. 15, the map showed the Ukrainian troops severing the rabbit ears from the rest of the Russian forces, effectively trapping the Russians who were there.\n\u201cTheir goal is to rush forward as far as possible, stop and hold a line,\u201d Palisa said. \u201cThey simply charged ahead and settled in place. There wasn\u2019t any deep strategic meaning behind it.\u201d\nAt least 21 Russians had surrendered in the previous three days, he said. \u201cThose who don\u2019t, we destroy,\u201d he added.\nVitalii Piasetskyi, the chief sergeant of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade, said his brigade\u2019s units were operating in two directions, including between Kramatorsk, one of the two major cities in Donetsk, and Dobropillia, \u201cwhere the enemy has managed to infiltrate deep into our defensive lines.\u201d He said the unit had stormed and cleared small settlements.\n\u201cThis is the tactic they are now using \u2014 infiltration that succeeded just beyond the limits of our area of responsibility,\u201d Piasetskyi said. He said mechanized assaults had become rare, because of the large number of drones in the air that can detect the movement of armored vehicles, trucks and motorcycles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a creeping offensive,\u201d he explained. His forces have discovered and eliminated many of the small groups of Russian troops. \u201cBut some of these groups do get through,\u201d Piasetskyi said.\nA soldier from the 1st Corps Azov of the Ukrainian National Guard stationed at the front near Dobropillia played down the seriousness of the recent Russian incursion. But the soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said Russian offensive actions had increased after the most recent flurry of peace talks ended.\nBoth Piasetskyi and Sgt. Oleksandr Karpiuk, of the \u201cInquisition\u201d unmanned systems battalion in the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, reiterated a frequent complaint from the front line \u2014 that the Ukrainian army does not have enough personnel, not enough drones.\nUkraine also does not yet have the technology to stop specialized Russian drone units that attack supply routes, Karpiuk said. The main current defense is to set up netting shields along roads and on vehicles.\nThe Russian units have inflicted a toll on Ukraine\u2019s drones. The large Ukrainian attack drone known to the Russians as Baba Yaga \u2014 named for a Slavic folklore witch who lived in a hut that stood on chicken legs \u2014 used to make an average of 70 flights before being shot down. Now it can barely make 10, Karpiuk said.\n\u201cWe need to admit that these units are working,\u201d Karpiuk said of the Russians. \u201cAll these new drone units are a new threat to us.\u201d"

      "text": "Moscow and Kyiv appear to remain far apart on what terms they would accept to end the war that began with Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nAmid a rapid run of diplomacy that included talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, followed by a White House summit between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, the Russian leader has maintained maximalist conditions for any potential settlement to the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II. Ukraine and Russia remain at an impasse over key issues, including the matter of a ceasefire as negotiations proceed, Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory and security guarantees for a postwar Ukraine.\nAfter the Trump-Putin meeting on Friday in Alaska, which ended early without a deal, Trump said \u201cmany points were agreed to\u201d and \u201cvery few\u201d are left. After his subsequent meeting with Zelenskyy, he said peace was \u201cwithin reach.\u201d\nBut he has spelled out few details, and wide gulfs seem to remain.\nMoscow spelled out detailed demands in a document handed to Ukrainian representatives during a round of direct negotiations in June. Russian state media outlets published the memorandum \u201con the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.\u201d Whether all of those positions stand, or some have been amended in talks, is unclear.\nTrump said Monday he is trying to set up a direct meeting between Ukraine, Russia and the United States \u201cas soon as we can.\u201d\nHere is where Russia and Ukraine stand on a deal.\nTerritory\nThree-and-a-half years into the war, Russia controls about one-fifth of Ukraine. Moscow says it wants to keep that and then some. The Kremlin has ruled out ceding any of the land it has seized.\nRussia annexed Crimea, including Sevastopol, in 2014, although it remains internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, it has illegally annexed other regions, including all of Luhansk, much of Donetsk and large parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But Ukraine continues to hold strategic territory in Donetsk.\nIn its June memorandum, Russia said a \u201ckey parameter\u201d of a final settlement is the international legal recognition of the incorporation of all five of those regions into the Russian Federation.\nIn an essay published in 2021, Putin argued that Russia and Ukraine were \u201cone people \u2014 a single whole\u201d and that Ukrainian sovereignty was \u201cpossible only in partnership with Russia.\u201d He accused the West of using Ukraine as an aggressive \u201canti-Russia project.\u201d\nZelenskyy has long emphasized that Ukraine would not surrender sovereign territory. He said ahead of his meeting with Trump that the issue of territory is so important it should only be discussed \u201cat the trilateral \u2014 Ukraine, the U.S., Russia.\u201d\nTrump said Monday after meeting with Zelenskyy that \u201cwe need to discuss the possible exchange of territory,\u201d while taking into account the current war lines. Swapping land to Russia remains unpopular in Ukraine and would pose constitutional challenges.\nRussia\u2019s terms also include demilitarizing Ukraine, which would leave the country with a small army incapable of deterring future attacks. Moscow\u2019s demands as of June included establishing a maximum number of Ukrainian armed forces, weapons \u201cand their permissible characteristics.\u201d\nThe Kremlin also said it would need confirmation that Ukraine did not possess and would not accept nuclear weapons.\nUkraine gave up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in 1994, in exchange for security guarantees from Russia that have not borne out.\nNeutrality and security guarantees\nTo justify his aggression in Ukraine, Putin cited the possibility of further expansion of NATO. Ukrainian membership in NATO, a defense alliance that requires member states to defend fellow members if they are attacked, is anathema for Putin.\nIn June, Russia said a key parameter of a peace agreement would be the \u201cneutrality of Ukraine,\u201d a refusal to join military alliances and coalitions, as well as international treaties that break neutrality.\nZelenskyy has said he sees eventual Ukrainian membership in the alliance as a key security guarantee. Before this week\u2019s meeting, Zelenskyy also said he \u201cconsider(s) EU accession to be part of security guarantees.\u201d\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump said that for Ukraine, there is \u201cno getting back\u201d Crimea and \u201cNO GOING INTO NATO.\u201d \u201cSome things never change!!!\u201d Trump said.\nNATO is larger than it was before the war began; Sweden and Finland were spurred to join. But U.S. commitment to the alliance has increasingly come into question under Trump.\nDuring the war, Russia has framed itself as fighting an existential battle against the \u201ccollective West\u201d because of NATO\u2019s support for Kyiv in its fight against Russia.\nUnder Article 5 of the NATO treaty, if a member country is attacked, other alliance members will consider it an armed attack on all members and take appropriate action.\nU.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News a day ahead of Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit that the United States is \u201cpotentially prepared to be able to give Article 5 security guarantees, but not from NATO \u2014 directly from the United States and other European countries,\u201d with the United States in a supporting role.\nWitkoff said Putin agreed to \u201crobust security guarantees\u201d while meeting with Trump, although Russia did not make public specific concessions.\nAfter meeting with Trump on Monday, Zelenskyy said the U.S. and European leaders discussed security guarantees.\nAs of June, the Kremlin had ruled out the presence of foreign peacekeepers in Ukraine \u2014 especially from NATO countries. It said a peace agreement would require a ban on military activity of third states on the territory of Ukraine.\nSanctions relief\nU.S. sanctions imposed on Russia by the Biden administration have weakened the Russian economy and hindered its military sector. Trump has signaled a willingness to discuss easing sanctions as part of a peace deal.\nPublicly, the Kremlin maintains that all sanctions are illegal and must be lifted. Privately, however, Moscow would welcome any relief from U.S. sanctions, as it would undermine Western unity in enforcing economic restrictions, according to analysts. Russia is particularly interested in lifting restrictions on transnational payments and the sale of gas and oil.\nIn its June memorandum, the Kremlin said it required a \u201cgradual restoration\u201d of diplomatic and economic relations with third countries. It also asked for the lifting of all economic sanctions between Russia and Ukraine.\nIn a trade spat with India, Trump has pressured the country to stop buying Russian oil.\nOne of the most significant measures Russia faced was the freezing of over $300 billion in Russian central bank assets held in the West. The European Union last year adopted a plan to use the interest generated from these frozen assets to support Ukraine.\nLast year, Putin condemned this strategy as \u201ctheft.\u201d Paris has proposed using the assets as collateral, allowing them to be seized if Moscow were to violate a potential ceasefire agreement.\nIn its June memorandum, the Kremlin said an agreement would require a \u201cwaiver of mutual claims\u201d in connection with \u201cdamage caused in military operations.\u201d\nReturn of civilians and soldiers\nZelenskyy on Monday said a key part of a deal would be the return of thousands of abducted children to Ukraine.\n\u201cThis should be one of our main priorities also in these negotiations to make sure that the children come back to Ukraine to their families,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the White House on Monday.\nZelenskyy also said he wants to bring home imprisoned soldiers and civilians, including journalists.\nIn May, Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners."
