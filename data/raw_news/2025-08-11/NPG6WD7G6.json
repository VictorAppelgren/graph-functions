  "description": "The Recon is a stackable, packable cooler with handy features. We packed it to the brim and took it camping to find out if it excels, or falls short of expectations.",
  "content": "It was a hot afternoon in Central Oregon when I pulled a cold beer from the Dometic Recon. \u201cI really dig the color,\u201d said a buddy, reaching blindly into the slurry of ice melt, fingers searching for a solitary can. We sat back in our camp chairs to unwind and reflect on the day\u2019s adventures as the Recon sat stoically in the corner of our campsite. It was day three of testing Dometic\u2019s stackable, packable cooler over a long holiday weekend to see if the Swedes had built something capable. My verdict? They had.\n\nWhile the Recon is not inexpensive, it\u2019s appointed with unique features and it keeps food and drink cold for days. True to Dometic\u2019s style, it also looks good\u2014the shape, colors and materials remind me of a crate you might find in a sci-fi game. But is it worth picking up a Recon when a Yeti Tundra costs about the same? Or is it worth the price when the RTIC Ultra-Light Cooler costs less and offers more capacity? Read on to learn more about the Dometic Recon\u2014why I like it, and where it falls short.\n\u2022 Easy access\u2014lid opens from both sides, and is removable\n\nMost hard-sided coolers are defined by their insulation, which makes it easy to overlook the importance of a reliable lid. But the lid is actually the single element of a cooler you\u2019re most likely to interact with, whether you\u2019re opening and closing it, standing on it or using it as a cutting board.\n\nDometic must have spent quite a bit of time mulling over the Recon\u2019s lid, because it\u2019s truly the most versatile one I\u2019ve come across. Of course, it opens and closes as any lid should, but it does so from either side thanks to sets of pivoting latches, which makes it far easier to access contents if, say, the cooler is awkwardly packed in the car, or fading daylight makes it tougher to see the details. I really wish more coolers would adopt this feature.\n\nSince both sides of the lid can come undone, it\u2019s no surprise that the lid is also fully removable\u2014simply unlatch all four fasteners and pop it off to efficiently pack it full, grab a lot of stuff or even set up a communal open-top food and drink bin. I didn\u2019t find this feature to be quite as useful in the real world as the dual-opening mechanism, but it did come in handy when rinsing the cooler with a hose after the long weekend.\n\nThe lid love doesn\u2019t stop there, either. The metal latch catchers on the body of the cooler double as bottle openers, and the top of the lid is sunken in and finished with a layer of rubber. I found it much easier to use the lid as a makeshift table for preparing food than similar hard-sided coolers with flat, plastic tops that offer very little grip. The lid also makes the Recon easier to stack with other Recon coolers or accessories, but we\u2019ll get to that in a bit.\n\nMost hard-sided coolers are assembled via a process known as rotational molding, or rotomolding, which heats and rotates plastic inside a mold to create a hollow, durable part, like the body of a cooler. The Recon, however, is made via injection molding, a process in which melted plastic is injected into a mold to form solid parts.\n\nAlthough rotomolding is technically better for insulation\u2014the hollow parts it creates can be filled with insulative material, like foam\u2014injection molding is generally lighter, which can benefit a jam-packed cooler that\u2019s going to be heavy.\n\nCarrying the fully-packed Recon from my car to the campsite wasn\u2019t much of a hassle; I found the setup to be fairly light even though parts like the lid, handles and latches are a bit more robust. All that is to say, the Recon doesn\u2019t feel much lighter than similarly sized coolers, but it isn\u2019t heavier, either, in spite of what it adds.\n\nI tested the container\u2019s insulation by filling it with ice, drinks and food, and monitoring contents over the weekend. Although outside temperatures never crested 80 degrees, the Recon kept everything cold without issue. I unscrewed the drain plug once each day to let water trickle out, but ice remained by the time I returned home and unpacked the cooler after three days of camping. I don\u2019t think its thermal retention is as good as Yeti\u2019s insulation, but it\u2019s on par with RTIC\u2019s, which I would expect at this price.\n\nUseful Accessories And Added Features, At No Extra Cost\n\nCoolers often come with basic accessories, like a dry basket, bottle opener, storage tray or what have you, and Dometic throws in a plastic divider and basket to organize contents. The divider looks and feels like a chopping board but Dometic doesn\u2019t explicitly say it\u2019s safe to use on food, so even though I did, I can\u2019t recommend you do the same. Tiny slats in the cooler\u2019s interior allow you to reposition the divider based on what you\u2019re packing, so it\u2019s fairly versatile for a simple piece of plastic.\n\nElsewhere, the Recon hides other features. In addition to the latches that double as bottle openers, a small magnet seated under the plastic shell, just above the drain plug, allows you to unscrew the plug and affix it to the cooler for safe keeping.\n\nFinally, the Recon is a stackable, packable cooler\u2014a feat made possible because it\u2019s flat on all sides. The flip-up handles sit flush with the sides of the cooler when stowed away, and only the lid is slightly indented to stack other Recon models on top, which comes in handy if you\u2019re packing the car or organizing gear. I really didn\u2019t think a cooler with flat sides would wow me (it\u2019s not the most groundbreaking concept), but it was useful when cramming the cooler next to storage boxes in the garage. And if you decide to invest in the Recon ecosystem, you\u2019ll appreciate it even more because of the Tetris-like synergy between coolers.\n\nThe Recon is smart and sleek, but it isn\u2019t perfect. For example, Dometic says the injection-molded shell is designed to cut weight, but the model I tested weighs just as much as similarly-sized coolers from the competition.\n\nIn fact, weighing in at 25.1 pounds empty, the Recon is heavier than the Yeti Tundra 45 (24.6 pounds) and the 52-quart RTIC Ultra-Light (21 pounds), even though the latter is bigger and offers more space. Ultimately, I don\u2019t think the Recon\u2019s selling point is what the scale says.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to overlook the Recon\u2019s sticker price. The medium-size, 43-quart cooler I tested retails for $325, or about the same as the Yeti Tundra 45 if you pick it up on Amazon. It\u2019s obvious Dometic put a lot of thought into getting the Recon line right, but some folks may have trouble justifying the sticker price.\n\nIf you can pick up a larger cooler like the RTIC Ultra-Light that\u2019s just as efficient, and save $100, you probably will. I think the Recon is priced fairly based on what it offers, but I also think you can get by with an similar cooler for less if you\u2019re already invested in Dometic\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe Recon is Dometic\u2019s latest take a on a hard-sided cooler, and it nailed the design. I really like the dual-opening, removable lid, squared sides and handy features, from the bottle openers to the magnetic drain plug. I also love the design\u2014no other cooler I\u2019ve tested receives as many compliments as this one. I might go so far as to say it\u2019s the best-looking piece of gear I\u2019ve tested in recent memory. Dometic put on a design masterclass that deserves recognition.\n\nWith that said, the Recon is on the heavy side, and it\u2019s pricey. At the end of the day, I think it\u2019s a great buy if you already own Dometic products, or want to build out a Dometic collection to ensure seamless functionality across products. It\u2019s also a great buy if you\u2019re a fan of good design\u2014I imagine there are quite a few of you out there. It may not be a groundbreaking cooler, but it\u2019s good at what it does and makes off-grid living just a little easier, in minor but meaningful ways.\n\nTo thoroughly test the Dometic Recon, I packed it with ice, food and drinks before heading out on a camping and mountain biking trip in Central Oregon. Over the course of three days, I opened the cooler periodically to grab essentials, and I monitored ice retention by gauging how much ice melted each day, draining any water at night to prevent it from building up. I also assessed the cooler\u2019s portability by moving it around the campsite from time to time, and I dropped it, tipped it over and used it as a seat to test its durability. On the way to and from the campsite, I packed it into a loaded SUV to evaluate how well it fit among other equipment.\n\nThe Forbes Vetted team reviews equipment and apparel that\u2019s designed to make off-grid living a little easier. Whether you\u2019re camping or hosting a backyard barbecue, your cooler of choice should keep food and drinks cold for hours if not days on end.\n\u2022 Author of this guide and Forbes Vetted gear editor, , has over six years of experience testing outdoors, health and wellness products. As an avid runner, skier, cyclist and backpacker, he spends tens if not hundreds of hours each year evaluating products, from coolers and camp stoves to running shoes and massage guns.\n\u2022 In addition to testing the Dometic Recon, Vigliotta worked closely with Forbes Vetted staff writer Steven John to thoroughly test and identify the best coolers over the course of several months. They spent considerable time reviewing models from Yeti, RTIC, Engel, Canyon and more.\n\u2022 This article was reviewed by Forbes Vetted executive editor , who has decades of experience reviewing tech, gear and fitness products. He wrote our roundup of the in which he personally tested and compared more than 15 ebikes.\n\u2022 By testing the Recon away from home for days on end, we\u2019ve learned just how capable it is, and how it stands to improve. Ultimately, our goal is to recommend coolers that aren\u2019t just insulative but also durable, portable and built to meet different needs.",

      "text": "A cooler\u2019s job isn\u2019t just to keep things cool. Instead, the best coolers need to offer multi-day ice retention, rugged durability and smart features that are convenient and easy to use. As avid campers, beachgoers, tailgaters and backyard party hosts, we tested seven coolers from brands like Yeti, RTIC and Coleman to identify the best models you can buy right now. Based on our findings, the RTIC Ultra-Light Cooler came out on top because it\u2019s spacious, secure, thoughtfully designed and keeps ice frozen for days.\nTo find the best coolers, we tested models in real-world conditions. From ice retention to durability to drainage, no stone was left unturned. Along the way, we found models we liked, including the Coleman Pro that weighs less than 20 pounds, and the Yeti Tundra 45 that features class-leading insulation. Of course, not every cooler impressed us, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve broken down the highs and lows of each model to help you choose one that meets your needs. Find our recommendations below.\nI was impressed with the RTIC Ultra-Light Cooler from the moment I picked it up, primarily because it\u2019s truly lighter than other coolers of the same size. And when I started testing it, I remained impressed in almost all regards. Upon adding 20 pounds of ice and sealing it shut, I checked in every eight hours, and even after an entire day, there was hardly any water at the bottom. Fast forward five days and plenty of ice remained to keep things cold. Only the Yeti Tundra 45 had better insulation results.\nIt pained me to push this cooler off a camp table and drop it on asphalt, but I need not have worried: Aside from a few minor scuffs, it looked good as new. It also stayed securely shut through every fall\u2014I found no issues with the rubber latches or the gasket, and impacts didn\u2019t cause it to leak. T-style latches pop into place with minimal effort and keep the lid closed.\nTo actually test the seal of this RTIC cooler, I filled it halfway with water, secured its lid and turned it on its side. While it was not exactly a waterfall, water did start leaking from the lid almost immediately. I was a bit off-put by this result, but as I would learn after testing multiple models, a leaky cooler is the norm, not the exception.\nConsidering this cooler has not one but two drain ports, I was a bit let down by the drainage experience. When half-filled with water, it took only a few minutes to empty with both valves open, but there was a fair amount of water left behind that sat below the reach of the drains. Fortunately, tipping it over to let the remaining water escape quickly solved this problem.\nI was already sold on this cooler because of its weight, ice retention and ease of closing, but a few thoughtful extras made it more compelling. These include a dry pouch set into the top of the cooler lid and a built-in bottle opener. Ultimately, this is a durable, insulative model that isn\u2019t perfect, but it checks almost every box and doesn\u2019t cost a fortune to own, unlike some of its rivals. For that reason, it\u2019s my top recommendation if you\u2019re looking for a combination of performance, features and price.\nWhile the RTIC Ultra-Light bills itself as lightweight, the Coleman Pro is more than a pound lighter. It\u2019s easy to carry even when fully-loaded, and it would be a breeze for two people to haul. The design stood up to durability testing without issue, though it took on more cosmetic damage compared to the other coolers I tested. Granted, coolers are meant to be used and abused, but this one held onto grass strains and the plastic shell looked a little beat up when dropped on pavement.\nThe Coleman Pro was also the outright loser in terms of leaking when positioned on its side\u2014water flowed out like a river. If you\u2019re concerned about spills, the poor seal is worth considering. And yet, while it isn\u2019t watertight, the lid is easy to close. Unlike models that feature stiff rubber latches, the Pro\u2019s steel latch closes effortlessly, which is a plus for those rare moments when you only have one free hand, like fishing.\nAs much as I was let down by the leakage, I was pleased with this cooler\u2019s ability to drain quickly and efficiently. I opened up its single drain valve and let the cooler do its thing, and within a few minutes, almost every last drop was gone. No water remained after leaving it open in the sun for just 15 minutes.\nHard-sided coolers are notoriously heavy and difficult to carry, even when empty, but the Coleman Pro sheds weight to make hauling your goods just a little easier. While the lightweight design comes at the cost of insulation, it should still keep food and drink cold for a couple of days. At $200, it\u2019s a well-priced model for fast-and-light adventures to the beach, campsite and beyond.\nThe Yeti Tundra 45 blew away the competition in terms of ice retention. After six days, it still contained chunks of ice, long after the ice melted in every other cooler. Finally, I had to call it and give up\u2014this cooler\u2019s insulation outlasted even our testing protocol. And beyond insulation, it felt incredibly rugged, with a certified bear-resistant construction that showed no signs of damage after multiple drops. Yeti gained recognition years ago for its insulation and durability, and these qualities are still present today.\nFunny enough, the Tundra 45 offers best-in-class insulation, but it was also one of the leakiest coolers I tested, second only to the Coleman Pro. Naturally, you might think a cooler that leaks so easily has a poor seal, but that\u2019s not the case here. When I secured the lid with the rubber latches and pushed down firmly on the top, I detected no air leaks. And as noted, it stayed closed during drop tests. This leads me to believe Yeti has simply mastered the art of rotomolded insulation.\nLike many of its rivals, the Tundra 45 has tie-down slots and multiple points for padlocks. These aren\u2019t special features, but they\u2019re worth mentioning, and you can find a lot of accessories on Yeti\u2019s website, though you\u2019ll pay more for the convenience they provide.\nAt the end of the day, this cooler is expensive, and you can probably get by with weaker insulation to save money, as evidenced by the cheaper RTIC Ultra-Light. But if you truly need class-leading insulation for hunting trips, van life or hot summer festivals, this is the cooler to buy.\nI was surprised to discover the cooler with the largest capacity\u2014Engel\u2019s 60-quart UltraLite Cooler\u2014was far from the heaviest. In fact, it was only 1.5 pounds heavier than the Coleman Pro, which makes it a great option for camping trips when you need to schlep it from the car to the campsite full of food and drink. It shrugged off multiple drops, save for a few scuff marks, and lost nothing in terms of performance or functionality. Based on my findings, it should stand up to the rigors of the great outdoors.\nLike almost every other cooler I tested, the Engel UltraLite was a slow but steady leaker. With that said, it\u2019s remarkably easy to open and close the lid\u2019s dual latches. There was a slight learning curve, but a few failed attempts helped me get the hang of it. And to my surprise, this cooler was the drainage winner\u2014upon unplugging the drain, I stood back and watched all the water clear out in about seven minutes.\nEngel includes a simple basket for dry goods, and a built-in bottle opener comes in handy as well. While it\u2019s fair to say most coolers in this guide are good for camping, the UltraLite wins out thanks to its lightweight build, reliable insulation and rugged durability. And at just $240, it delivers a better value than Yeti or Canyon, offering 25% more capacity at a lower price in a cooler that\u2019s easy to carry wherever adventure takes you.\nThe RTIC Ultra-Light Wheeled Cooler faces steep competition as more wheeled models hit the market, but it remains a durable, versatile design that ultimately won over our tester. Thanks to a set of plastic puncture-resistant wheels and a solid metal handle attached to the side, it\u2019s easy to maneuver over roots, rocks, sand and pavement. And when you combine that all-terrain prowess with top-tier insulation (it retained ice for five days), durability and a reasonable sticker price, you\u2019re left with a wheeled cooler that looks good on paper and performs as it should in the real world.\nThe Ultra-Light Wheeled Cooler\u2019s biggest competition is probably the Yeti Roadie 48, a model we also tested and loved. Unlike the RTIC\u2019s solid metal handle, the Yeti features a telescoping suitcase-style handle that rises from the back. It\u2019s incredibly maneuverable but relies on more moving components, and dropping it at the wrong angle can actually bend the handle if it\u2019s extended. RTIC\u2019s handle is shorter, so the cooler is kind of awkward to pull behind you, but it\u2019s ultimately stronger and still easy to use. Therefore, it inches out the Yeti Roadie.\nBeyond wheels and handles, the Ultra-Light shook off multiple drops, including one on hard pavement that forced the wheels to absorb the impact. Inside, a rubber storage net built into the lid serves as a hammock of sorts for dry goods, and a single drain port evacuates water efficiently. RTIC also attaches a metal bottle opener to one of the corners, and rubber T-latches are easy to lock into place.\nThe RTIC isn\u2019t going to beat Yeti when it comes to insulation, but it\u2019s comparable in almost every other way, and nearly $200 less. If you\u2019re looking for a wheeled cooler that keeps things cold for days, can take a beating and doesn\u2019t sweat varied terrain, this is a great option.\nOther Coolers We Tested\nHere are a couple of other coolers we tested that didn\u2019t quite make our list of top picks. These models aren\u2019t bad by any means, but they don\u2019t stand out as the best options for a particular preference.\nYeti Roadie 48: This is an excellent wheeled cooler that features a suitcase-style handle, durable wheels, effortless latches and a deep bin for taller objects, like bottles of wine. It didn\u2019t make the list of winners because the handle is made with a lot of moving parts that can break, and while the cooler offers best-in-class insulation, it\u2019s a lot more expensive than similar models, like RTIC\u2019s Ultra-Light Wheeled Cooler.\nCanyon Coolers Outfitter V2: This cooler earned high marks for its insulation and strong seal that refused to leak, even when the cooler was tipped on its side for an hour. While we found it to be a well-rounded model, it didn\u2019t wow us for any particular reason, and at $300, it\u2019s a bit more expensive than the competition without offering any distinct advantages.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted gear team is comprised of outdoor equipment and apparel experts who perform exhaustive research, conduct interviews and spend time with products in the field. From coolers to electric bikes to GPS watches, we evaluate products that are often considered investments to help you make more informed buying decisions.\n- This guide was written by Forbes Vetted staff writer Steven John, who has covered outdoor products for over a decade and spent time recreating outside for much longer than that. He tested coolers from RTIC, Yeti, Coleman, Engel and others over the course of multiple weeks to find the best models available right now.\n- This guide is overseen and edited by Forbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta, an outdoor enthusiast who spends as much time exploring the landscapes of the Pacific Northwest as he can. Vigliotta helped test wheeled coolers for this guide by rolling them up and down hills, dropping them from tables and subjecting them to other destructive experiments.\n- We spoke with several experts for additional insights and opinions on all things coolers. These include: Andrew Straley, chief gear expert for Kampgrounds of America; Joel Fletcher, a Gearhead with Backcountry.com; and Tom Callahan, senior vice president of product development at 4Patriots, a company specializing in emergency preparedness products.\n- Because new and updated coolers are released regularly, we revisit and revise this guide as needed to keep it up to date with the latest recommendations and information. It was first published in May 2025.\nHow We Tested The Best Coolers\nTo identify the best coolers, we created a testing protocol that focused on four key variables: durability, ice retention, locking method and seal, and additional features. With insights from Straley, Fletcher and Callahan, we evaluated each cooler\u2019s performance, testing everything from insulation and construction to latches and drain plugs. Below is a breakdown of how we tested coolers, and the expert advice that guided us along the way.\nDurability\nTo find out just how tough these coolers are, we dropped each one from waist height (around three feet) onto a hard surface, multiple times from multiple angles. We also left them outside for days, rolled them up and down hills, knocked them over, slammed them shut and treated them with the kind of disrespect that only real-world use can deliver. Afterwards, we inspected them for cracks, broken latches and lid separation.\nIce Retention\nTo test how long each cooler could keep contents cold, we ran a side-by-side experiment under controlled conditions. First, we brought all coolers to room temperature with their lids open for an hour, then added the same amount of ice and recorded a baseline internal temperature. We then placed the coolers in a shaded, sheltered area away from direct sun and rain to level the playing field.\nEvery eight hours, we opened each cooler to gauge the ice level, note how much was left and measure the internal temperature. To simulate real-world use, we opened each cooler for two minutes every 12 hours and continued testing until all the ice had melted (save for the Yeti Tundra 45, which refused to give in after six days). We compared results based on how long each cooler held ice and how quickly the ice levels dropped.\nSeal, Locking Mechanism And Drainage\nA cooler\u2019s ability to keep things cool isn\u2019t just about insulation\u2014it\u2019s also about how it seals and drains. To test for leaks, we filled each cooler halfway with water, closed the lid and tilted it in multiple directions before leaving it on its side, watching for drips around the lid, drain plug and seams.\nFrom there, we applied pressure to the lid to see if it flexed, created air gaps or failed to stay shut. And finally, we checked how efficiently each cooler drained by opening the drain plug and timing how long it took to empty, noting which models had leftover standing water inside.\nAdditional Features\nA lot of modern coolers come with additional features, from built-in bottle openers to dry racks and cutting boards. Coolers outfitted with convenient extras, like bottle openers, drain ports and padlock slots earned additional points, and we made note of coolers that included larger accessories, though these didn\u2019t earn more points because some brands make you pay for them. Ultimately, these features shouldn\u2019t dictate which cooler is right for you, but they can factor into the decision process.\nHow To Pick The Best Coolers\nThe best coolers aren\u2019t cheap, so take your time when determining which one will meets your needs. Keep the following considerations in mind to help you find a durable, reliable model for adventures to come.\nIce Retention\n\u201cIn my experience, value ice retention over all else,\u201d says 4Patriot\u2019s Tom Callahan. \u201cThere is something to be said for never having to make a late-night ice run again.\u201d Most modern coolers can keep contents cold for days at a time, but some models offer better insulation than others. Consider household names like Yeti, RTIC, Canyon and Coleman that have extensive track records when it comes to reliable insulation. All of the coolers we tested kept ice in its solid form for at least an entire day.\nCapacity\nCooler capacity is measured in quarts, though a lot of brands also list the number of 12-ounce cans it can hold. We tested medium-sized models that fell within the 45- to 60-quart range, but the right capacity depends on your unique circumstances.\u201cSizing will be dependent on how many people are going to be using the cooler and how long you will be out,\" says Joel Fletcher. \"A 25-quart cooler will get one person by for a day trip or overnight adventure, whereas if you are going to be spending a week on the river or on an overland trip, a 100-plus-quart cooler will be what you need.\u201d\nWeight And Portability\nLift a cooler that weighs 20 pounds and do the same with a cooler that weighs 30 pounds, and you\u2019ll quickly realize the extra weight adds up fast. Add food and drink to the equation, and a cooler that feels light when empty can be unwieldy or even impossible to lift on your own when fully loaded. Most of the coolers in this guide weigh less than 30 pounds when empty, so it\u2019s more important to look for thoughtful features like grab handles, straps or wheels that make them easier to transport.\nDurability\nAny decent cooler can survive the occasional drop or bump without issue, but take time to consider the level of hardship your cooler may face. Do you need one that can \u201cwithstand being strapped to the back of a raft or the bed of a truck,\u201d asks Fletcher? Or one that can handle the added weight when used as a seat or step stool? All of the coolers covered in this guide are rugged and capable, though some are more prone to popped latches or cosmetic damage than others. Look for well-known brands with strong warranties to make sure your cooler serves you for years to come.\nAdditional Features\nNever let bells and whistles sell you on a cooler, but if you\u2019re on the fence between two models that have similar ice retention and capacity ratings, look for extras like a built-in bottle opener, non-slip feet, a dry basket and other extras that will make the experience that much more enjoyable."

      "text": "To find the best electric bikes on the market, I tested a dozen top-rated options over more than a year by assembling, measuring and, of course, riding them. After a thorough evaluation, I found the Ride1Up Prodigy V2 to be the best electric bike overall: It has a responsive mid-motor design, low-maintenance belt drive, continuous variable transmission and other high-end features\u2014all at an affordable price tag.\nBut that\u2019s not only the electric bike worth considering. Whether you need an ebike for commuting, off-roading, mountain biking or carrying pets and groceries, there\u2019s an option that can do the job just as well, if not better than, a traditional bike. To make the most informed decision, read on to see the top four ebikes I tested, and what I loved about each. For more recommendations, take a look at our guides to the best folding electric bikes and electric bikes for seniors.\nRide1Up has found itself in this guide on a number of occasions in the past, thanks to a family of bikes that all tend to offer excellent build quality and features that punch above their weight class. In other words, you can usually find design elements in Ride1Up bikes that you\u2019d have a lot of trouble finding at the same price point in most other bikes. The Prodigy V2 is no exception, and having spent a fair bit of time on the seat of the original Prodigy, I can say with confidence that the V2 is a substantial improvement over the original model\u2014which was already a good ride.\nA Smooth Ride Over All Terrain\nThere\u2019s no question that the Prodigy 2 is an ebike; it weighs a formidable 61 pounds\u2013not something you\u2019ll want to carry around or hang on a rack\u2013and has a chunky downtube that clearly houses a battery. Even so, the styling is clean and elegant, with gorgeous, sculpted contours.\nIt\u2019s built around a 250W Brose mid-drive motor that spins the rear wheel via a Gates Carbon belt. Not only is the belt quieter than a chain, but it requires less maintenance (you never have to grease it, for example) and should last longer as well. That alone makes this a great ride. But perhaps the coolest feature in the Prodigy 2 is the Enviolo Continuously-Variable Transmission. It\u2019s a fully internal stepless gear system that lets you shift continuously from the lowest gear to the highest just by twisting a collar on the handlebar. And as you twist the collar, a cool analog graphic on the handlebar depicts the terrain as getting hilly or flat, so you always know which way to turn the collar and its effect on your gearing. The difference between an ordinary multi-gear bike and one with a CVT is like night and day, making this bike a joy to ride over all terrain. And it\u2019s hard to find a bike with a CVT in this price range; for example, you can favorably compare the $2,700 Prodigy V2 to the $5,000 Gazelle Ultimate C380 HMB, the only other bike in this roundup with a similar drivetrain.\nPremium Features For An Elevated Experience\nThere\u2019s a lot more here that I loved. The bike also has an adjustable front suspension which contributes to the smooth and comfy riding experience, along with premium brakes, integrated front and rear lights and a 28 mph top speed with four levels of pedal assist. And you don\u2019t have to pay extra for the rear storage rack. You can get the Prodigy V2 in a step-though or step-over frame, and if you want to save some money, it\u2019s available with a chain drive rather than the belt, for $300 less.\nLong-Term Testing Notes\nSix months later, the Prodigy V2 continues to be my bike of choice for most rides. The smooth and stepless Continuously-Variable Transmission is a joy to use, and I love the handlebar display which shows you visually what gear you\u2019re in. After using the Prodigy V2\u2019s CVT, it feels like going back to the stone age when I ride any other bike. I do wish this bike were lighter; at over 60 pounds, it\u2019s a pain to lift and move around, and it\u2019s too heavy to hang on the wall of my garage or for some car bike racks\u2013so it\u2019s clearly not the best choice for everyone.\nThe 2025 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.\nIt\u2019s hard to find a quality electric bike for much under $1,000\u2014it just isn\u2019t practical to make an ebike for much less. Per Leo Raudys, CEO of Call2Recycle, the first industry-wide ebike battery recycling program in the U.S., \"If the battery itself costs perhaps $600, and the entire bike is only a little bit higher than that, then you have to ask questions like, \u2018How good are the components? How good do I feel about the engineering? Is it going to hold up over time?\u2019 It gets pretty difficult to do that at that price.\" Still, a handful of quality ebikes are available in this price range. Lectric\u2019s XP 3.0 might be among the least expensive bikes you can buy, but it\u2019s so thoughtfully designed that it\u2019s a genuinely good choice for first-time ebike buyers and city riders on a budget.\nA Powerful Model With Space-Saving Features\nThe Lectric XP 3.0 is powered by a 1,000-watt rear hub motor with a 500-watt-hour battery that can get you up to 65 miles on a single charge (in my testing, I\u2019d say you could expect closer to 45 miles in real-world riding conditions). It\u2019s a Class 3 bike that tops out at 28 mph on pedal assist and 20 mph with the twist throttle. The Lectric XP 3.0 has lights, fenders, 3-inch fat tires with hydraulic brakes and\u2014surprisingly\u2014a hydraulic suspension.\nOf course, I buried the lede: This is a foldable bike, collapsing to about half its normal size, thanks to a locking hinge in the middle of the frame. Unfortunately, I feel like I\u2019m fighting a fat octopus every time I fold it. This bike weighs a hefty 64 pounds, and you need to be careful when you handle it lest you end up with a pinched finger. But the fact that it folds makes it easy to throw in the back of a minivan or store in the corner of the garage.\nWide Range Of Useful Accessories\nOne of the things I love most about the XP 3.0 is its wide array of accessories. This is a utility bike, after all, and you can add a cargo package with racks and baskets, or get a pet trailer that hitches to the back. You can also add a passenger seat for a second rider as well.\nOf course, no $1,000 bike is going to be perfect. The small 20-inch wheels mean the ride is bumpier than what you\u2019d get from a bigger tire, and the industrial aesthetics won\u2019t please everyone. But the stuff you do get is compelling. The black-and-white digital display is big, easy to read and tells you everything you need to know to have a great ride. The price is the major selling point, however, and after riding this bike a lot, it seems to me that Lectric has made the right choices to balance cost against performance.\nLong-Term Testing Notes\nWhile this bike originally shipped with mechanical brakes, Lectric enhanced later iterations with hydraulic brakes. Customers with the original mechanical brakes (including myself) got an unexpected gift from Lectric: an easy-to-install hydraulic brake upgrade kit, free of charge. That sort of thing really endears me to this brand, and the bike itself is holding up well. It\u2019s built like a tank (which admittedly continues to be an annoyance when I want to put it in the back of my car), which suggests it may literally outlive me.\nThe 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.\nRad Power\u2019s RadRunner 3 Plus isn\u2019t going to win any beauty awards; it\u2019s utilitarian through and through, with a heavy, angular frame that sits on squat 20-by-3.3-inch fat tires. But all that practicality shapes the RadRunner 3 Plus into the best utility ebike on the market.\nA Versatile Bike With Impressive Operation\nThis Class 2 bike can power its way up to 20 mph using either pedal assist or the twist throttle. The smaller tires are very grippy, making them awesome for almost any sort of road or trail condition, and the ride is smoother than I expected, thanks to the suspension in the front fork. The beefy 750-watt hub motor gave me a thoroughly authoritative ride; it aggressively raced up a steep incline that taxed many other ebikes during ride tests. That said, it sometimes feels a little jerky in operation, but that\u2019s going to be true of any bike with a cadence sensor: The pedal assist is either on or off, and it takes a pedal rotation or two to engage the motor. But I was really impressed with the components in the RadRunner, including a seven-speed Shimano shifter and Tektro hydraulic brakes. Despite this bike\u2019s formidable weight (more on that later), I was able to bring it to a stop very quickly.\nThis is a general-purpose ebike; you can use it to commute around town or go for weekend joyrides, and I used it for both. But the RadRunner 3 Plus was born to be a utility bike, and Rad Power gives you a lot of options to configure the design based on your needs. Need to carry cargo? There\u2019s a locking hardshell console you can mount between your legs, for example, which I found handy for stowing personal items. You can add front and rear baskets, a tow-behind trailer and even a passenger seat.\nHeavier Design May Require Expert Assembly\nI also loved the controls and display. Rad Power includes two consoles on the handlebars; the power unit on the left prominently reports the level of pedal assistance, while another display shows your speed and other details. That\u2019s all you get, though; there is no mobile app to sync with here.\nThe lack of mobile phone connectivity is just one way this bike feels a tad old school. It\u2019s the heaviest bike I tested by far, clocking in at over 75 pounds. It was almost impossible for me to hoist it onto my car\u2019s trailer hitch bike rack by myself, but I managed to pull it off. The battery isn\u2019t hidden in the downtube but is semi-integrated into the frame, removable with a key (when you first get started, you might think the key locks the bike, but don\u2019t be fooled). It also was among the least-assembled bikes to arrive at my doorstep. If you\u2019re somewhat mechanically inclined, you should be able to put it together yourself. If, however, you open the box and it looks like a random collection of pinball machine parts, you might want to drive it to a local bike shop for assembly. That is what I did, despite videos online to help you assemble it.\nThe battery also has its own display for charge status, which I really appreciated, and I managed to get about 40 miles on a single charge. Your mileage may vary depending on terrain and how much you lean on the motor to get around.\nLong-Term Testing Notes\nYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a better utility ebike than the Rad Power\u2019s RadRunner 3 Plus\u2014I couldn\u2019t. Since I have several bikes in my garage for long-term testing, each one has its own very specific role. The RadRunner is my cargo bike, and I use it to make trips to the grocery store once or twice a week. With baskets in front and rear along with the storage console in the middle, there\u2019s more than enough room to bring a few bags of sundries home. And the ride remains comfortable\u2014I genuinely appreciate the adjustable seat considering that many utility bikes don\u2019t offer that option.\nEven if you\u2019re not a road-racing fan, you know Greg LeMond, the three-time Tour de France winner who is probably the most well-known American cyclist (Lance Armstrong notwithstanding). LeMond has his own bike brand, and the LeMond Prolog is its flagship ebike.\nEffortless Riding In A Luxury Package\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way right up front: The Prolog is a $5,500 bike, and that\u2019s if you don\u2019t upgrade to the electronic shifter, which is another $800. With so many other, more affordable bikes on the market, you may be wondering why anyone would spend that much money for an ebike. Simply put, because it\u2019s a work of art, in motion and at rest. The bike is visually stunning with its clean, aerodynamic lines and not the slightest indication it\u2019s an electric bike without close inspection. The aesthetics are absolutely impeccable.\nAnd when you climb aboard? I have never had so much fun on an ebike. Weighing in at just 27 pounds, it\u2019s lighter than my traditional non-electric bike, and that means it flies like the wind, easily accelerating from a cold stop whether or not the electric motor is engaged. It handles like a dream, and if I had $5,500 to spend on an electric bike, I would spend it on the Prolog without hesitation.\nElegant, User-Friendly Design\u2014But Lacks Security Features\nYou\u2019re not paying for a lot of \u201csmart\u201d features with the Prolog. Yes, you can connect to the bike via a mobile app that gives you control over the pedal assist and a detailed dashboard while you\u2019re riding (though you\u2019ll need to buy your own phone mount). Instead, most of that money is going into the paperweight carbon fiber frame and the breathtaking styling, along with a Shimano 11-speed GRX shifter and other deluxe components, like the Shimano BL-RS600 hydraulic disc brake lever. The front and rear lights are elegantly integrated into the frame, and a single button on the top tube turns on the bike and controls the pedal assist (if you choose to keep your phone in your pocket). You also get a limited lifetime warranty on the frame and wheels (and two years on the LeMond components)\u2014something almost unheard of in a world of ebikes, where you tend to get just one or two years of protection.\nYou might be tempted to think the Prolog is just a sport bike, but you can easily use it for day-to-day city bike duties. Options include adding a rack, basket and range-extending battery, if you want more than the maximum of 70 miles that LeMond claims (based on my testing, it\u2019s closer to 55 miles in real-world conditions). And don\u2019t worry that the 250-watt Mahle rear hub motor won\u2019t be able to deliver the goods. This bike handled all the terrain I tested the other bikes on, and easily scaled the steep overpass that I cannot pedal on leg power alone.\nNot everyone has $5,500 to spend on an ebike, so for many folks (myself included) this is an aspirational choice. But therein lies a serious problem: Whether or not you consider this affordable, a bike that costs this much money should have some built-in security\u2014GPS tracking, a hub lock or even a lockout that prevents the bike from turning on without the app. I\u2019d be wary of leaving a bike this precious around town without a beefy chain and lock. But that aside, if you have the money to invest in the LeMond Prolog, you will not be disappointed.\nLong-Term Testing Notes\nAfter a few months, the Prolog continues to have all the same limitations I identified in the original review. It\u2019s terrifyingly expensive, which makes me worry about theft whenever I take it into town, and as a sports bike, it certainly isn\u2019t handy for cargo. But after a year, it still rides like a dream\u2014the best bike I have ever owned, electric or otherwise. It\u2019s so light that you don\u2019t even need pedal assist to start moving from a cold stop, and I am constantly amazed that it really delivers the range that LeMond promises.\nThe Best Electric Bikes Compared\nElectric bikes come in a variety of builds, but the right one for you depends on your specific needs and budget. Below, I break down how my top picks compare across a variety of key factors such as battery, weight and top speed.\nOther Electric Bikes I Tested\nVelotric T1 (4.5, $1,599): The Velotric T1 packs so much into such an affordable frame\u2014and rides so well\u2014that it was nearly my favorite bike. Its affordability also makes the Velotric\u2019s host of high-end smart features (including a fingerprint reader and mobile app compatibility) all the more impressive. However, it\u2019s currently out of stock, which is ultimately why it\u2019s not on my list of winners.\nUrtopia Carbon 1 Pro (4, $2,199): I really wanted to love the Urtopia Carbon 1 Pro more than I did. It\u2019s a lightweight and fun ebike with a lot of high tech under the hood. However, the display is very hard to read in direct sunlight, and I found the voice feature to be sketchy on the open road.\nVvolt Alpha II (4, $1,899): The Alpha II is a fairly lightweight bike that gets almost everything right. You get speeds up to 20 mph with 5 levels of pedal assist and thumb lever throttle for no-pedal acceleration. I wasn\u2019t thrilled with the single-speed drivetrain, though, which led to a lot of free-spinning ghost pedaling.\nBrompton P Line 4-Speed (4, $4,230): Brompton\u2019s P Line is immediately distinguished by its tiny 17-inch wheels. It\u2019s also a folding bike, collapsing to little more than a pair of overlapping wheels. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve to folding it (I had to watch a video a dozen times before I could fold it the first time), and the battery pack has to be physically removed to fold the bike up.\nVanMoof S4 (4, $2,648): The VanMoof S4 is packed with exciting tech, but the ride itself is underwhelming; you have to use the VanMoof app to change pedal assist levels because the button on the bike only triggers the throttle-like turbo boost mode. And after coasting, you often have to pedal a few full revolutions before the gears engage, which is disconcerting and uncomfortable.\nGazelle Ultimate C380 HMB (4, $4,999): The Gazelle Ultimate C380 HMB features a superb Enviolo 380 Trekking Manual stepless gear system, just like the one built into the Ride1Up Prodigy V2. That said, it\u2019s overpriced compared to Ride1Up, heavy enough to be inconvenient and isn\u2019t available direct-to-consumer (you have to visit a Gazelle dealer bike shop).\nCannondale Adventure Neo Allroad (3.5, $1,340): The Cannondale Adventure Neo Allroad is a solid and fun all-around adventure bike, but in a lot of ways, it feels like a step down from Ride1Up\u2019s Prodigy. It\u2019s similarly heavy, which can make it hard to move around, but it lacks the Prodigy\u2019s Shimano shifter. I also feel like it doesn\u2019t compete well with similar models from other brands.\nGocycle G4i (3.5, $3,999): The G4i is a great bike, albeit a luxury one. The fork-shaped kickstand is ultra-secure, but annoyingly you can only deploy it from one side of the bike. The torque sensor adjusts power to the wheels based on how hard you pedal, but the only way to change power levels is via the unintuitive mobile app.\nHow I Tested The Best Electric Bikes\nWhen selecting the products for this roundup, it was important to include the most popular and common ebikes on the market\u2014the ones that Forbes Vetted readers are most likely to consider. I included both direct-to-consumer ebikes (from online, mail-order brands) and models that you need to visit dealerships to purchase. I assembled a cross-section of bikes in styles most people want to ride, like commuter and city bikes, folding bikes, off-road bikes and utility bikes that can carry cargo. I then tested 12 bikes for over a year to evaluate their performance.\nAssembly\nOnce all the bikes were on hand, I evaluated how easy they were to assemble. Some come fully assembled, while most are partially built and can be finished with some simple tools in less than an hour. A handful of bikes required substantial assembly; if you\u2019re not already a confident bike mechanic, you\u2019ll want to factor another $100 into the price to have a local bike shop assemble it for you. The bottom line is that I noted the overall difficulty (and potential expense) of the initial out-of-box experience.\nRide Experience\nI took every bike on a handful of 10-mile treks across city streets, onto dirt and grassy paths and on a paved bike path that cuts across a substantial part of the state of Michigan. I noted each bike\u2019s comfort, handling, shifting and braking. In other words: How well did it work as an actual bike?\nPower And Range\nAs with any electric vehicle, it\u2019s important to understand how much power the motor delivers and what kind of range you can expect to get. To assess how well the motor could power the bike, I paid attention to pedal assist and throttle response on level ground as well as on a particularly steep overpass that I am physically unable to scale on a traditional bike with leg power alone. I also tracked real-world range, although this can vary enormously depending on a wide variety of factors.\nSmart And Security Features\nI love so-called smart features, and I explored whatever each bike offered, like integrated displays, electronic shifting and high-tech security. Some bikes had few or none of these capabilities, while others were veritable props from a science-fiction story. I assessed how easy these features were to use and whether they were practical or useful. Bikes with integrated anti-theft or security features tended to score better.\nHow To Pick An Electric Bike\nWhen you shop for a bike, start with how you expect to use the bike most often. In addition, make sure to consider the style of ebike, the class and additional features, like security, brakes and the motor.\nBike Style\nThere are a lot of different bike styles, and some tend to overlap, but here are the most common ebikes you\u2019ll encounter:\n- Commuter and city bikes. These are everyday bikes you use to get around town on paved roads, but some are also \u201chybrid\u201d bikes that can handle off-roading as well.\n- Fat tire bikes. You know you\u2019re looking at a fat tire bike when the tires are a couple of inches wide. All that surface area adds up to a lot of traction, which is great for riding on sand, snow and soft off-road surfaces.\n- Utility bikes. These don\u2019t look that sexy, but they let you bolt on baskets in front or back, drag a cargo trailer and sometimes even add a passenger seat. These are workhorse bikes you can use to go grocery shopping or make Grubhub deliveries. In fact, cargo bikes are a subset of the utility bike category.\n- Mountain bikes. Designed for intense off-road adventures, a good mountain bike has wide tires and a beefy suspension system to let you go up and down steep and rugged terrain. Mountain bikes that only have front suspensions are often called hardtails.\n- Sport bikes. Also known as performance bikes, these follow in the footsteps of racing bikes. They\u2019re light, have paper-thin tires, and let you go fast with manual pedal power, with or without electric assistance.\nClass\nSimilarly, ebikes come in three different classes that determine how fast it can go and what it\u2019s like to ride it. Keep in mind though that some cities and municipalities have banned Class 3 bikes on trails and bike paths, categorizing them not as \u201cbikes\u201d but as powered vehicles, like mopeds or motorcycles.\n- Class 1 ebikes have a top speed of 20 mph using pedal assistance (PAS). The motor is designed to cut off if you exceed 20 mph, and no Class 1 bikes include a throttle.\n- Class 2 models have a throttle that can propel the bike up to 20 mph whether you\u2019r pedaling or not\u2014and can go up to the same maximum speed with pedal assist.\n- Class 3 bikes have a top speed of 28 mph when using pedal assistance, and may optionally include a throttle. The throttle (if there is one) can be used to accelerate the bike without pedaling, but it\u2019s limited to a maximum of 20 mph. To reach the top speed of 28 mph, you need to use pedal assist.\nTerrain\nConsider where you plan to ride your electric bike. If you ride in a flat area, a 250-watt motor is a good fit. However, if you plan to ride in an area with a lot of hills, you\u2019ll need a more powerful motor with at least 500 watts.\nAccessories\nSome ebikes come with equipped with certain accessories, while others require you to purchase those separately. Evaluate what additions you might appreciate before making your purchase. For example, many bikes\u2014especially utility and commuter bikes\u2014feature attachment points that let you bolt on storage racks and baskets, a passenger seat and more. Those who plan to commute to work on an ebike may also want to invest in a model with fenders, which come in handy to shield you from splashing dirt, mud and water while riding.\nSecurity\nBikes get stolen. A lot. So while you should always lock your bike when you step away, I love when security comes integrated with many modern ebikes. Look for models with additional helpful safety features, like GPS tracking and hub locks, to help keep your ebike safe.\nFolding Capability\nSome ebikes are designed to fold down to a more compact size for easier storage or transport. Riders with limited space in their homes and offices or those who frequently travel with their bikes in vehicles or RVs may prefer this more portable style of bike. It\u2019s worth noting that models with folding designs often feature smaller wheels, which can lead to a slightly bumpier ride.\nTechnical Specs\nThe technical specifications are also important. Not a bike mechanic? No problem\u2014here are some things to keep an eye on:\n- Motor. If you plan to ride mainly on city streets or have a limited budget, you can stick with a hub motor that\u2019s built into the wheel itself. For adventurous terrain and a better riding experience, consider a mid-drive motor that\u2019s in the middle of the bike and generally require a custom frame to be engineered around it.\n- Sensor. The most common are cadence and torque sensors. A cadence sensor are usually built into bikes with hub motors and are the least expensive form of ebike. Torque sensors, on the other hand, are typically found in bikes with mid-motors and smoothly match the power of your pedaling.\n- Pedal assistance. Ebikes are easier to ride when they include both multiple levels of pedal assistance (PAS) and a mechanical or electronic shifter. Single-gear ebikes that rely just on PAS can be awkward to handle when the terrain isn\u2019t level.\n- Hydraulic brakes. Ebikes are heavier than traditional bikes and can go a fair bit faster, so you want a lot of stopping power. Avoid mechanical brakes (more common in very inexpensive ebikes).\n- Throttle. Not all ebikes have a throttle. Class 2 ebikes and some Class 3 ebikes have a throttle that can accelerate without pedaling. The real question, though, is whether you need a throttle. It can be helpful, especially on hilly terrain. But consider a throttle a convenience that most riders can do without.\n- Mobile app. If you\u2019re a nerd, look for ebikes that work with an app. Some ebikes sync with a mobile app that lets you customize the bike\u2019s performance in detail, as well as see your speed and PAS on a big beautiful screen when riding. Bonus points for apps that track your cycling stats and workout.\n- Other components. When in doubt, look for name brand components. Is the shifter designed in-house by the bike brand? It\u2019s probably fine, but a Shimano shifter is probably going to work more smoothly and last longer.\nMy Expertise\nI have been a technology journalist since the 1990s with countless writing credits at publications as diverse as Forbes, PC World, Digital Camera Magazine, CNET, TechHive and Insider (not to mention authoring nearly three dozen books). I have managed to mix that with a love of biking. As an early adopter of electric bikes, I have written and reviewed many models from their earliest days on the market, building a small collection of ebikes in my garage that I use to get around town and go on long weekend recreational treks. I\u2019ve stayed abreast of the latest developments in electric biking while testing numerous models over the last decade.\nTo help me navigate the ebike universe, I also leaned on the expertise of four unabashed experts in the field:\n- Alyssa Mcadam, head mechanic for ebike reseller Upway.\n- Leo Raudys, CEO of Call2Recycle, which operates the first industry-wide ebike battery recycling program in the U.S.\n- Ash Lovell, Ph.D., the electric bicycle policy & campaign director at PeopleForBikes.\n- Levi Conlow, the CEO of Lectric Bikes.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThis story\u2019s edits and updates are overseen by our seasoned gear team. We\u2019ve researched, tested and reviewed a wide variety of outdoor equipment and apparel.\n- Our gear team includes: gear editor Cam Vigliotta, who holds a degree in kinesiology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst; and Kari Molvar, an expert in athletic apparel and an avid runner.\n- In addition to the best overall electric bikes, we\u2019ve covered electric bikes designed for specific uses and groups, including electric bikes for seniors and folding electric bikes. Our coverage also extends to hybrid bikes, mountain bikes and more.\n- We revisit this article regularly to ensure our recommendations and buying advice are up to date.

      "text": "A cooler\u2019s job isn\u2019t just to keep things cool. Instead, the best coolers need to offer multi-day ice retention, rugged durability and smart features that are convenient and easy to use. As avid campers, beachgoers, tailgaters and backyard party hosts, we tested seven coolers from brands like Yeti, RTIC and Coleman to identify the best models you can buy right now. Based on our findings, the RTIC Ultra-Light Cooler came out on top because it\u2019s spacious, secure, thoughtfully designed and keeps ice frozen for days.\nTo find the best coolers, we tested models in real-world conditions. From ice retention to durability to drainage, no stone was left unturned. Along the way, we found models we liked, including the Coleman Pro that weighs less than 20 pounds, and the Yeti Tundra 45 that features class-leading insulation. Of course, not every cooler impressed us, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve broken down the highs and lows of each model to help you choose one that meets your needs. Find our recommendations below.\nI was impressed with the RTIC Ultra-Light Cooler from the moment I picked it up, primarily because it\u2019s truly lighter than other coolers of the same size. And when I started testing it, I remained impressed in almost all regards. Upon adding 20 pounds of ice and sealing it shut, I checked in every eight hours, and even after an entire day, there was hardly any water at the bottom. Fast forward five days and plenty of ice remained to keep things cold. Only the Yeti Tundra 45 had better insulation results.\nIt pained me to push this cooler off a camp table and drop it on asphalt, but I need not have worried: Aside from a few minor scuffs, it looked good as new. It also stayed securely shut through every fall\u2014I found no issues with the rubber latches or the gasket, and impacts didn\u2019t cause it to leak. T-style latches pop into place with minimal effort and keep the lid closed.\nTo actually test the seal of this RTIC cooler, I filled it halfway with water, secured its lid and turned it on its side. While it was not exactly a waterfall, water did start leaking from the lid almost immediately. I was a bit off-put by this result, but as I would learn after testing multiple models, a leaky cooler is the norm, not the exception.\nConsidering this cooler has not one but two drain ports, I was a bit let down by the drainage experience. When half-filled with water, it took only a few minutes to empty with both valves open, but there was a fair amount of water left behind that sat below the reach of the drains. Fortunately, tipping it over to let the remaining water escape quickly solved this problem.\nI was already sold on this cooler because of its weight, ice retention and ease of closing, but a few thoughtful extras made it more compelling. These include a dry pouch set into the top of the cooler lid and a built-in bottle opener. Ultimately, this is a durable, insulative model that isn\u2019t perfect, but it checks almost every box and doesn\u2019t cost a fortune to own, unlike some of its rivals. For that reason, it\u2019s my top recommendation if you\u2019re looking for a combination of performance, features and price.\nWhile the RTIC Ultra-Light bills itself as lightweight, the Coleman Pro is more than a pound lighter. It\u2019s easy to carry even when fully-loaded, and it would be a breeze for two people to haul. The design stood up to durability testing without issue, though it took on more cosmetic damage compared to the other coolers I tested. Granted, coolers are meant to be used and abused, but this one held onto grass strains and the plastic shell looked a little beat up when dropped on pavement.\nThe Coleman Pro was also the outright loser in terms of leaking when positioned on its side\u2014water flowed out like a river. If you\u2019re concerned about spills, the poor seal is worth considering. And yet, while it isn\u2019t watertight, the lid is easy to close. Unlike models that feature stiff rubber latches, the Pro\u2019s steel latch closes effortlessly, which is a plus for those rare moments when you only have one free hand, like fishing.\nAs much as I was let down by the leakage, I was pleased with this cooler\u2019s ability to drain quickly and efficiently. I opened up its single drain valve and let the cooler do its thing, and within a few minutes, almost every last drop was gone. No water remained after leaving it open in the sun for just 15 minutes.\nHard-sided coolers are notoriously heavy and difficult to carry, even when empty, but the Coleman Pro sheds weight to make hauling your goods just a little easier. While the lightweight design comes at the cost of insulation, it should still keep food and drink cold for a couple of days. At $200, it\u2019s a well-priced model for fast-and-light adventures to the beach, campsite and beyond.\nThe Yeti Tundra 45 blew away the competition in terms of ice retention. After six days, it still contained chunks of ice, long after the ice melted in every other cooler. Finally, I had to call it and give up\u2014this cooler\u2019s insulation outlasted even our testing protocol. And beyond insulation, it felt incredibly rugged, with a certified bear-resistant construction that showed no signs of damage after multiple drops. Yeti gained recognition years ago for its insulation and durability, and these qualities are still present today.\nFunny enough, the Tundra 45 offers best-in-class insulation, but it was also one of the leakiest coolers I tested, second only to the Coleman Pro. Naturally, you might think a cooler that leaks so easily has a poor seal, but that\u2019s not the case here. When I secured the lid with the rubber latches and pushed down firmly on the top, I detected no air leaks. And as noted, it stayed closed during drop tests. This leads me to believe Yeti has simply mastered the art of rotomolded insulation.\nLike many of its rivals, the Tundra 45 has tie-down slots and multiple points for padlocks. These aren\u2019t special features, but they\u2019re worth mentioning, and you can find a lot of accessories on Yeti\u2019s website, though you\u2019ll pay more for the convenience they provide.\nAt the end of the day, this cooler is expensive, and you can probably get by with weaker insulation to save money, as evidenced by the cheaper RTIC Ultra-Light. But if you truly need class-leading insulation for hunting trips, van life or hot summer festivals, this is the cooler to buy.\nI was surprised to discover the cooler with the largest capacity\u2014Engel\u2019s 60-quart UltraLite Cooler\u2014was far from the heaviest. In fact, it was only 1.5 pounds heavier than the Coleman Pro, which makes it a great option for camping trips when you need to schlep it from the car to the campsite full of food and drink. It shrugged off multiple drops, save for a few scuff marks, and lost nothing in terms of performance or functionality. Based on my findings, it should stand up to the rigors of the great outdoors.\nLike almost every other cooler I tested, the Engel UltraLite was a slow but steady leaker. With that said, it\u2019s remarkably easy to open and close the lid\u2019s dual latches. There was a slight learning curve, but a few failed attempts helped me get the hang of it. And to my surprise, this cooler was the drainage winner\u2014upon unplugging the drain, I stood back and watched all the water clear out in about seven minutes.\nEngel includes a simple basket for dry goods, and a built-in bottle opener comes in handy as well. While it\u2019s fair to say most coolers in this guide are good for camping, the UltraLite wins out thanks to its lightweight build, reliable insulation and rugged durability. And at just $240, it delivers a better value than Yeti or Canyon, offering 25% more capacity at a lower price in a cooler that\u2019s easy to carry wherever adventure takes you.\nThe RTIC Ultra-Light Wheeled Cooler faces steep competition as more wheeled models hit the market, but it remains a durable, versatile design that ultimately won over our tester. Thanks to a set of plastic puncture-resistant wheels and a solid metal handle attached to the side, it\u2019s easy to maneuver over roots, rocks, sand and pavement. And when you combine that all-terrain prowess with top-tier insulation (it retained ice for five days), durability and a reasonable sticker price, you\u2019re left with a wheeled cooler that looks good on paper and performs as it should in the real world.\nThe Ultra-Light Wheeled Cooler\u2019s biggest competition is probably the Yeti Roadie 48, a model we also tested and loved. Unlike the RTIC\u2019s solid metal handle, the Yeti features a telescoping suitcase-style handle that rises from the back. It\u2019s incredibly maneuverable but relies on more moving components, and dropping it at the wrong angle can actually bend the handle if it\u2019s extended. RTIC\u2019s handle is shorter, so the cooler is kind of awkward to pull behind you, but it\u2019s ultimately stronger and still easy to use. Therefore, it inches out the Yeti Roadie.\nBeyond wheels and handles, the Ultra-Light shook off multiple drops, including one on hard pavement that forced the wheels to absorb the impact. Inside, a rubber storage net built into the lid serves as a hammock of sorts for dry goods, and a single drain port evacuates water efficiently. RTIC also attaches a metal bottle opener to one of the corners, and rubber T-latches are easy to lock into place.\nThe RTIC isn\u2019t going to beat Yeti when it comes to insulation, but it\u2019s comparable in almost every other way, and nearly $200 less. If you\u2019re looking for a wheeled cooler that keeps things cold for days, can take a beating and doesn\u2019t sweat varied terrain, this is a great option.\nOther Coolers We Tested\nHere are a couple of other coolers we tested that didn\u2019t quite make our list of top picks. These models aren\u2019t bad by any means, but they don\u2019t stand out as the best options for a particular preference.\nYeti Roadie 48: This is an excellent wheeled cooler that features a suitcase-style handle, durable wheels, effortless latches and a deep bin for taller objects, like bottles of wine. It didn\u2019t make the list of winners because the handle is made with a lot of moving parts that can break, and while the cooler offers best-in-class insulation, it\u2019s a lot more expensive than similar models, like RTIC\u2019s Ultra-Light Wheeled Cooler.\nCanyon Coolers Outfitter V2: This cooler earned high marks for its insulation and strong seal that refused to leak, even when the cooler was tipped on its side for an hour. While we found it to be a well-rounded model, it didn\u2019t wow us for any particular reason, and at $300, it\u2019s a bit more expensive than the competition without offering any distinct advantages.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted gear team is comprised of outdoor equipment and apparel experts who perform exhaustive research, conduct interviews and spend time with products in the field. From coolers to electric bikes to GPS watches, we evaluate products that are often considered investments to help you make more informed buying decisions.\n- This guide was written by Forbes Vetted staff writer Steven John, who has covered outdoor products for over a decade and spent time recreating outside for much longer than that. He tested coolers from RTIC, Yeti, Coleman, Engel and others over the course of multiple weeks to find the best models available right now.\n- This guide is overseen and edited by Forbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta, an outdoor enthusiast who spends as much time exploring the landscapes of the Pacific Northwest as he can. Vigliotta helped test wheeled coolers for this guide by rolling them up and down hills, dropping them from tables and subjecting them to other destructive experiments.\n- We spoke with several experts for additional insights and opinions on all things coolers. These include: Andrew Straley, chief gear expert for Kampgrounds of America; Joel Fletcher, a Gearhead with Backcountry.com; and Tom Callahan, senior vice president of product development at 4Patriots, a company specializing in emergency preparedness products.\n- Because new and updated coolers are released regularly, we revisit and revise this guide as needed to keep it up to date with the latest recommendations and information. It was first published in May 2025.\nHow We Tested The Best Coolers\nTo identify the best coolers, we created a testing protocol that focused on four key variables: durability, ice retention, locking method and seal, and additional features. With insights from Straley, Fletcher and Callahan, we evaluated each cooler\u2019s performance, testing everything from insulation and construction to latches and drain plugs. Below is a breakdown of how we tested coolers, and the expert advice that guided us along the way.\nDurability\nTo find out just how tough these coolers are, we dropped each one from waist height (around three feet) onto a hard surface, multiple times from multiple angles. We also left them outside for days, rolled them up and down hills, knocked them over, slammed them shut and treated them with the kind of disrespect that only real-world use can deliver. Afterwards, we inspected them for cracks, broken latches and lid separation.\nIce Retention\nTo test how long each cooler could keep contents cold, we ran a side-by-side experiment under controlled conditions. First, we brought all coolers to room temperature with their lids open for an hour, then added the same amount of ice and recorded a baseline internal temperature. We then placed the coolers in a shaded, sheltered area away from direct sun and rain to level the playing field.\nEvery eight hours, we opened each cooler to gauge the ice level, note how much was left and measure the internal temperature. To simulate real-world use, we opened each cooler for two minutes every 12 hours and continued testing until all the ice had melted (save for the Yeti Tundra 45, which refused to give in after six days). We compared results based on how long each cooler held ice and how quickly the ice levels dropped.\nSeal, Locking Mechanism And Drainage\nA cooler\u2019s ability to keep things cool isn\u2019t just about insulation\u2014it\u2019s also about how it seals and drains. To test for leaks, we filled each cooler halfway with water, closed the lid and tilted it in multiple directions before leaving it on its side, watching for drips around the lid, drain plug and seams.\nFrom there, we applied pressure to the lid to see if it flexed, created air gaps or failed to stay shut. And finally, we checked how efficiently each cooler drained by opening the drain plug and timing how long it took to empty, noting which models had leftover standing water inside.\nAdditional Features\nA lot of modern coolers come with additional features, from built-in bottle openers to dry racks and cutting boards. Coolers outfitted with convenient extras, like bottle openers, drain ports and padlock slots earned additional points, and we made note of coolers that included larger accessories, though these didn\u2019t earn more points because some brands make you pay for them. Ultimately, these features shouldn\u2019t dictate which cooler is right for you, but they can factor into the decision process.\nHow To Pick The Best Coolers\nThe best coolers aren\u2019t cheap, so take your time when determining which one will meets your needs. Keep the following considerations in mind to help you find a durable, reliable model for adventures to come.\nIce Retention\n\u201cIn my experience, value ice retention over all else,\u201d says 4Patriot\u2019s Tom Callahan. \u201cThere is something to be said for never having to make a late-night ice run again.\u201d Most modern coolers can keep contents cold for days at a time, but some models offer better insulation than others. Consider household names like Yeti, RTIC, Canyon and Coleman that have extensive track records when it comes to reliable insulation. All of the coolers we tested kept ice in its solid form for at least an entire day.\nCapacity\nCooler capacity is measured in quarts, though a lot of brands also list the number of 12-ounce cans it can hold. We tested medium-sized models that fell within the 45- to 60-quart range, but the right capacity depends on your unique circumstances.\u201cSizing will be dependent on how many people are going to be using the cooler and how long you will be out,\" says Joel Fletcher. \"A 25-quart cooler will get one person by for a day trip or overnight adventure, whereas if you are going to be spending a week on the river or on an overland trip, a 100-plus-quart cooler will be what you need.\u201d\nWeight And Portability\nLift a cooler that weighs 20 pounds and do the same with a cooler that weighs 30 pounds, and you\u2019ll quickly realize the extra weight adds up fast. Add food and drink to the equation, and a cooler that feels light when empty can be unwieldy or even impossible to lift on your own when fully loaded. Most of the coolers in this guide weigh less than 30 pounds when empty, so it\u2019s more important to look for thoughtful features like grab handles, straps or wheels that make them easier to transport.\nDurability\nAny decent cooler can survive the occasional drop or bump without issue, but take time to consider the level of hardship your cooler may face. Do you need one that can \u201cwithstand being strapped to the back of a raft or the bed of a truck,\u201d asks Fletcher? Or one that can handle the added weight when used as a seat or step stool? All of the coolers covered in this guide are rugged and capable, though some are more prone to popped latches or cosmetic damage than others. Look for well-known brands with strong warranties to make sure your cooler serves you for years to come.\nAdditional Features\nNever let bells and whistles sell you on a cooler, but if you\u2019re on the fence between two models that have similar ice retention and capacity ratings, look for extras like a built-in bottle opener, non-slip feet, a dry basket and other extras that will make the experience that much more enjoyable."

      "text": "There are few better ways to spend long sunny days than at the beach. You can surf, read, play in the sand and, when you have one of the best beach coolers on hand, enjoy your preferred cold beverages and fresh eats, even on the hottest summer days. When you pick the right beach cooler\u2014perhaps our top pick, the RTIC 32-Quart Ultra-Light Cooler\u2014and pack it with enough ice or ice packs, even hours of blazing summer sun won\u2019t warm up your food and drink.\nBefore selecting the beach coolers featured in this guide, we spoke with experts, consulted Forbes Vetted staffers and relied on our own experiences with many of these models. From the wheeled RovR RollR 45 to the backpack-style Hydro Flask Day Escape, we\u2019ve got you covered with the best options for a day by the water. Find our recommendations below, along with expert insights and advice to make the buying process a little easier.\nThe Ultra-Light from RTIC looks like a hefty piece of hardware, but it\u2019s surprisingly light at just 13 pounds when empty. And even when you take full advantage of the 32-quart capacity\u2014enough room for 30 pounds of ice, or 48 12-ounce cans\u2014this cooler is still easy to move about. It also packs in some clever features, like a built-in bottle opener, tie-down points and non-skid rubber feet that prevent it from sliding about.\nRTIC coolers are known for their rugged reliability, but they tend to show wear more noticeably than other brands we\u2019ve tested. That said, this is still a durable and highly efficient cooler with rock-solid insulation, so if you don\u2019t mind that it picks up scrapes and scratches, it\u2019s a lifetime purchase that will keep goods cold no matter how many days you spend at the beach\nColeman\u2019s Classic Series Hard Cooler proves you don\u2019t have to pay top dollar for a decent chilly bin. Insulation, durability and capacity are all adequate for a day at the beach, and the only thing we\u2019d like to see is a latch or two to keep the lid shut. As it is, if the cooler falls over, there\u2019s a good chance all your goods will spill onto the sand, so don\u2019t let the kids or distracted friends tip it over. Do, however, enjoy the impressive 80-can capacity and three-day ice retention, even in temperatures as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIf you need a boost, this Coleman is also tough enough to support someone weighing up to 250 pounds using it as a seat or step stool, which is impressive considering it weighs less than nine pounds. And when the lid isn\u2019t being used as a seat, it doubles as a small table thanks to four recessed cupholders. Ultimately, it\u2019s not going to be as insulative or durable as other top-tier models, but it\u2019s great for casual trips to the beach and other summer adventures.\nThe RollR 45 from RovR is one tough piece of hardware. It can shrug off drops, rolls and other accidents without popping open, or popping a tire. Those nine-inch wheels roll right over dirt, grass, gravel and of course, sand without breaking a sweat. And you\u2019ll need the wheels\u2014this thing weighs almost 30 pounds when empty, which makes it difficult to lift from shelves or into the back of the car based on our testing. Thankfully, once it\u2019s on the ground and ready to roll, deploying the suitcase-style handle makes moving it from A to B an absolute (ocean) breeze.\nInside, you\u2019ll find a plastic dry bin to separate food and utensils from ice and ice melt, though you won\u2019t find any water in the bottom for quite some time\u2014the insulation is outstanding, even in direct sunlight. What you will find is an assortment of compatible RovR accessories sold separately, including cupholders, a cutting board and even a large storage bin, all of which attach to the cooler in some way. It\u2019s pricey, but if you\u2019re willing to spend a bit more on reliable wheels, insulation and accessories, you\u2019ll never wrestle with a heavy cooler again.\nBest Soft Beach Cooler\nA Plush And Portable Chilly Bin\nYeti Hopper Flip\nWeight: 4.5 pounds | Capacity: 18 quarts | Locking method: Zipper | Special features: Yes | Warranty: 3 years\nThe Yeti Hopper Flip can hold a generous assortment of 12-ounce cans (30, to be exact) provided there\u2019s no ice, or you can stash a 12-pack, plenty of snacks and enough ice to keep contents cold for a day at the beach. It features a rugged, waterproof zipper that keeps sand and seawater out, and you can haul it from the side handles, a top handle or an included shoulder strap. And unlike a hard-sided cooler, it\u2019s easy to stuff in the car or wedge into a canoe\u2014the soft walls bend and flex, unlike the rigid plastic on a traditional hard-sided cooler.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to toss, stuff or otherwise push this cooler to its limits, either. It\u2019s backed by a strong three-year warranty, and in classic Yeti fashion, it can handle just about anything you throw at it, save for a shark encounter. It can also double as a dry bag to safely stash food, clothing and even electronics if you want to strap it to a paddle board or kayak. Of course, you\u2019re going to pay a bit more for a Yeti, but if you\u2019re looking for a reliable soft cooler that\u2019s a step above the rest, this is a great option.\nBest Backpack Beach Cooler\nA Comfortable Way To Carry Lots Of Food And Drink\nHydro Flask Day Escape\nWeight: 2.7 pounds | Capacity: 21 quarts | Locking method: Zipper | Special features: Yes | Warranty: 5 years\nCarrying a fully-loaded cooler across hot sand is no easy task, even if you\u2019re sharing the load with others. Tossing those cans into a backpack that disperses the load, however, makes the process a whole lot easier. And the best backpack cooler for the job is the Hydro Flask Day Escape that features padded and adjustable shoulder straps as well as an adjustable sternum strap that helps balance the load. When empty, this backpack cooler weighs a mere 2.7 pounds, yet it\u2019s rated to keep things cold for up to 36 hours if loaded with enough ice.\nBased on our experience, the backpack\u2019s zipper can be stubborn, probably because it\u2019s leak-resistant, but that\u2019s a tradeoff you\u2019ll be willing to make at the beach. Like the Yeti Hopper Flip, it also doubles as a dry bag for water sports, or even winter sports if you want to bring it to an apres scene. Hydro Flask finishes the design with a mesh pouch and gear attachment loops to secure your keys or one of the best Bluetooth speakers.\nBest Small Beach Cooler\nSnacks, Drinks And Essentials For Two\nIgloo Tag Along Too\nWeight: 4.1 pounds | Capacity: 11 quarts | Locking system: Side lid locks | Special features: No | Warranty: 1 year\nA cooler is a lot like a suitcase: You tend to overpack it \u201cjust to be safe\u201d but rarely use everything inside, which is why a compact option like the Igloo Tag Along Too is usually all you really need. This small cooler will hold more than enough food and drink for those low-key beach outings, and it takes up far less space than a big, bulky cooler when you\u2019re not using it. Measuring just 13.07 x 9.33 x 13.07 inches, it\u2019s smaller than your standard carry-on luggage, but it still fits 14 12-ounce cans.\nThe Tag Along Too\u2019s lid is secured in place by little wings attached to the shoulder strap, and when it\u2019s open, the lid is designed to sit upright for easy access. If you were to load this compact cooler with ice alone, you could expect it to insulate for more than two days, which is plenty long enough if you\u2019re packing for two, or spending an afternoon by the water.\nThe gear team at Forbes Vetted never recommends products without throughly evaluating them first. That means research, hands-on testing, conversations with experts and a thorough review of online ratings left by verified buyers. From traditional coolers to beach chairs and wagons, we seek out only the best products for a day by the water.\nForbes Vetted staff writer Steven John wrote this article and relied on his years of experience testing and evaluating coolers to make sound recommendations. He also spent time with some of these brands while testing coolers as part of our larger hard-sided cooler guide.\nThis story was edited by Forbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta, an avid outdoorsman who regularly tests gear and apparel in the field. He has experience with the RTIC, RovR, Yeti and Hydro Flask models featured in this guide.\nWe also spoke with experts in the cooler space, including Jeremy Yamaguchi, CEO of Cabana, and Jonathan Inaba, a buyer with Sun & Ski Sports. Their insights helped us find coolers that are durable, reliable and perfect for the beach, and they even recommended specific models that meet different needs.\nHow We Chose The Best Beach Coolers\nYour cooler is indispensable if you want to spend any meaningful amount of time relaxing in the sand. As your source of sustenance, hydration and libations, it\u2019s important to invest in a cooler that\u2019s built for the demands of a sizzling summer day. Here\u2019s how we made our selections:\nFirst, we established the metrics by which we would evaluate all beach coolers, such as portability, capacity, insulation and durability. Then, we looked into cooler categories to identify different types of coolers that meet different needs, whether you\u2019re looking for a wheeled cooler or a backpack cooler.\nNext, we found several contenders for each category and compared them side by side, considering variables like ice retention, locking systems and special features.\nFinally, we came up with a final collection of coolers worth buying and compared our notes with online reviews. The result: an assortment of top-tier coolers that keep contents cold and have no issue outlasting the elements.\nHow To Shop For Beach Coolers\nPortability\nYour beach cooler does you zero good if it\u2019s too heavy and clunky to haul across the sand. Look for models with big handles, wheels and shoulder straps, as these make it easy to move your cooler from point A to point B.\nMost hard-sided coolers are fairly heavy, but backpack and soft-sided styles are great alternatives, and they\u2019re just as reliable when it comes to insulating. \u201cFor beach coolers, I prefer ones that you can sling over your back,\u201d says Yamaguchi. \u201cI like the Hydro Flask Day Escape insulated cooler, which can be worn like a backpack.\u201d\nCapacity\nCapacity is one of the more important things to consider, so think about how many people you\u2019re packing for and how long you\u2019ll be at the beach. A small beach cooler, around 10 to 20 quarts, is perfect for one or two people, while a group or family may need a cooler that\u2019s 40 quarts or bigger. Keep in mind that bigger coolers can hold more food, drinks and ice, but they\u2019re also heavier and harder to carry.\nInsulation\nReliable insulation keeps your food and drink cold for hours, so look for a cooler with thick walls and a tight-fitting lid to keep the cold in and the heat out. Some coolers\u2014including the ones we recommend in this guide\u2014are made with thicker insulation to keep contents cold for days. If you\u2019ll be in the sun for hours, better insulation means your goods will stay colder, longer. Again, good insulation can make a cooler heavier, so find one that balances your needs.\nDurability\nSand, sun and saltwater can be tough on materials, which is why it\u2019s worth looking for a cooler made from strong, weather-resistant plastic or fabric. Sturdy hinges, durable handles and watertight zippers are also important\u2014the more rugged the design, the longer it will last and handle wear and tear."

  "argos_summary": "The Dometic Recon cooler is a stylish and functional option for outdoor enthusiasts, featuring a dual-opening, removable lid and robust insulation that keeps contents cold for days. While it is heavier than some competitors and priced similarly to high-end models like Yeti, its unique features, such as bottle opener latches and stackable design, make it a strong contender. However, potential buyers may find better value in alternatives like the RTIC Ultra-Light Cooler, which offers similar performance at a lower price.",
