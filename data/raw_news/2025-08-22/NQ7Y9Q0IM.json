  "content": "A sinkhole the size of a 10p piece has sparked chaos and closed an entire road for more than a week.\n\nThe tiny hole has led to the closure of a 79-metre stretch of road in Cowes on the Isle of Wight, more than 3,000 times the circumference of the sinkhole itself.\n\nIsland Roads, the local highway authority, said the closure was necessary due to a 'larger void' beneath the road surface.\n\nLocals were quick to voice frustration, though, with Josie Parsons saying there were far worse roads on the island needing attention.\n\nShe said: 'Oh come on, Island Roads. I know of worse roads than that 10 pence hole. Have you got no sense?\n\n'The sooner your contract with the council ends, the better; it can't come soon enough as far as I'm concerned.\n\nOthers, like David Johnson, joked about the pace of repair, saying: 'I've just spoken to Island Roads and they said they are waiting for an expert from the mainland to arrive to assess the situation. They expect repairs will be completed by Christmas.'\n\nOne man said he initially thought the closure was an April Fool's joke. 'I've just checked my calendar. Thought this was an April Fool joke. Or is that the council,' he said.\n\nSinkholes happen when the surface layer of the ground collapses.\n\nThe largest on record is in rural Chongqing, China, measuring 537 metres wide and 626 metres deep.\n\nWork to fix the Cowes sinkhole is scheduled to start on Tuesday, August 26, after the road was first closed on August 18. It is expected to remain shut until at least August 29.\n\nAn Island Roads spokesperson told the BBC: 'The appearance of initially small holes of this nature are very often a sign of larger voids beneath the road surface.\n\n'This was the case in this instance, and following an inspection, the road was closed for safety reasons.\n\n'The site has now been taken over by Southern Water, who will begin significant work to address the underlying issue on Tuesday once the necessary parking restrictions have been issued.\n\n'There are several very short diversions in place and, given there are only a few parking spaces in this section of road, we hope disruption to residents and road users will be minimal.'\n\nSouthern Water said: 'Our teams will start work on Tuesday to fix a section of broken sewer beneath St Mary's Road.\n\n'We are not able to say how long the work is likely to take until we have investigated further, but we will keep local residents informed of progress.\n\n'We apologise for any inconvenience caused while we carry out the repair.'",
