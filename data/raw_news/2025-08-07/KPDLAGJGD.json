  "description": "WHEATON, Ill., August 07, 2025--First Trust Advisors L.P. (\"First Trust\"), a leading exchange-traded fund (\"ETF\") provider and asset manager, announced today that it has launched a new ETF, the First Trust RBA Deglobalization ETF (Nasdaq: DGLO) (the \"fund\"). The fund seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield (before the fund\u2019s fees and expenses) of the RBA U.S. Deglobalization Index (the \"index\").",
  "content": "\" DGLO is our latest exciting product within our long-standing association with First Trust, \" said Richard Bernstein, CEO, CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors (the \"index provider\"). \"RBA has been a leader in understanding and investing in deglobalization, and this new index and ETF are built upon that knowledge. Investors now have the opportunity to invest in a major structural shift in the economy via a broad range of companies that could benefit from deglobalization.\"\n\nThe index is designed to track the performance of U.S. companies that may benefit from accelerating deglobalization and its implications. It provides exposure to industrial, energy and materials companies focused on infrastructure, aerospace & defense, transportation and other services, as well as cybersecurity companies, which the index provider believes are inflation beneficiaries and may benefit from increased deglobalization and geopolitical conflict. To be included in the index, companies are also evaluated and assigned a \"Deglobalization Score\" based on their percentage of revenue coming from the U.S., positive 12-month forward earnings estimate, Net Debt to EBITDA less than the company\u2019s sub-industry average, and exposure to the aerospace & defense industry.\n\nThe global economy is undergoing a significant transformation as countries shift towards local production and reduce their reliance on international supply chains, a phenomenon known as deglobalization. This process involves decreasing economic interconnectedness and interdependence between countries, characterized by a decline in international trade and investment, as well as a reduced dependence on global supply chains. \"Globalization reshaped markets, creating distinct winners and losers, but as the pendulum swings toward deglobalization, new risks and opportunities may arise,\" said Ryan Issakainen, CFA, Senior Vice President and ETF Strategist at First Trust. \" DGLO targets companies poised to benefit from this shift, many of which are overlooked by ETFs tracking broad market indices.\"\n\nWHEATON, Ill., August 07, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- First Trust Advisors L.P. (\"First Trust\"), a leading exchange-traded fund (\"ETF\") provider and asset manager, announced today that it has launched a new ETF, the First Trust RBA Deglobalization ETF (Nasdaq: DGLO ) (the \"fund\"). The fund seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield (before the fund\u2019s fees and expenses) of the RBA U.S. Deglobalization Index (the \"index\").\n\nFor more information about First Trust, please contact Ryan Issakainen at (630) 765-8689 or RIssakainen@FTAdvisors.com.\n\nFirst Trust is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the fund\u2019s investment advisor. First Trust and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (\"FTP\"), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately held companies that provide a variety of investment services. First Trust has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $278 billion as of June 30, 2025 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. First Trust is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. First Trust and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. For more information, visit https://www.ftportfolios.com.\n\nYou should consider a fund\u2019s investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 or visit www.ftportfolios.com to obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about a fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nYou could lose money by investing in a fund. An investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed. There can be no assurance that a fund's objective(s) will be achieved. Investors buying or selling shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Please refer to each fund's prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for additional details on a fund's risks. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.\n\nUnlike mutual funds, shares of the fund may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation/redemption units. If a fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at a premium or discount to a fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting and the bid/ask spread may widen.\n\nCurrent market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. For example, changes in governmental fiscal and regulatory policies, disruptions to banking and real estate markets, actual and threatened international armed conflicts and hostilities, and public health crises, among other significant events, could have a material impact on the value of the fund's investments.\n\nA fund is susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. Such events could cause a fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss.\n\nInformation technology companies and cyber security companies are generally subject to the risks of rapidly changing technologies, short product life cycles, fierce competition, aggressive pricing and reduced profit margins, loss of patent, copyright and trademark protections, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. Cyber security companies may also be smaller and less experienced companies, with limited product lines, markets, qualified personnel or financial resources.\n\nEnergy companies are subject to certain risks, including volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels, international politics, terrorist attacks, reduced demand, the success of exploration projects, natural disasters, clean- up and litigation costs relating to oil spills and environmental damage, and tax and other regulatory policies of various governments. Oil production and refining companies are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding air emissions and the disposal of hazardous materials and may be subject to tariffs. In addition, oil prices are generally subject to extreme volatility.\n\nEquity securities may decline significantly in price over short or extended periods of time, and such declines may occur in the equity market as a whole, or they may occur in only a particular country, company, industry or sector of the market.\n\nAn index fund will be concentrated in an industry or a group of industries to the extent that the index is so concentrated. A fund with significant exposure to a single asset class, or the securities of issuers within the same country, state, region, industry, or sector may have its value more affected by an adverse economic, business or political development than a broadly diversified fund.\n\nA fund may be a constituent of one or more indices or models which could greatly affect a fund's trading activity, size and volatility.\n\nThere is no assurance that the index provider or its agents will compile or maintain the index accurately. Losses or costs associated with any index provider errors generally will be borne by a fund and its shareholders.\n\nIndustrials and producer durables companies are subject to certain risks, including the general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess capacity and consumer demand and spending trends. They may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, labor relations, and government regulations.\n\nLarge capitalization companies may grow at a slower rate than the overall market.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund.\n\nA fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares due to a limited number of market makers. Decisions by market makers or authorized participants to reduce their role or step away in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of a fund's portfolio securities and a fund's market price.\n\nMaterials and processing companies are subject to certain risks, including the general state of the economy, consolidation, domestic and international politics and excess capacity. Materials companies may also be significantly affected by volatility of commodity prices, import controls, worldwide competition, liability for environmental damage, depletion of resources and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control devices.\n\nLarge inflows and outflows may impact a new fund's market exposure for limited periods of time.\n\nAn index fund's return may not match the return of the index for a number of reasons including operating expenses, costs of buying and selling securities to reflect changes in the index, and the fact that a fund's portfolio holdings may not exactly replicate the index.\n\nA fund classified as \"non-diversified\" may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, a fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nA fund and a fund's advisor may seek to reduce various operational risks through controls and procedures, but it is not possible to completely protect against such risks. The fund also relies on third parties for a range of services, including custody, and any delay or failure related to those services may affect the fund's ability to meet its objective.\n\nA fund that invests in securities included in or representative of an index will hold those securities regardless of investment merit and the fund generally will not take defensive positions in declining markets.\n\nHigh portfolio turnover may result in higher levels of transaction costs and may generate greater tax liabilities for shareholders.\n\nThe market price of a fund's shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the fund's net asset value (\"NAV\") as well as the relative supply of and demand for shares on the exchange, and a fund's investment advisor cannot predict whether shares will trade below, at or above their NAV.\n\nTrading on an exchange may be halted due to market conditions or other reasons. There can be no assurance that a fund's requirements to maintain the exchange listing will continue to be met or be unchanged.\n\nFirst Trust Advisors L.P. (FTA) is the adviser to the First Trust fund(s). FTA is an affiliate of First Trust Portfolios L.P., the distributor of the fund(s).\n\nThe information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person.
