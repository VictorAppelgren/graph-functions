  "content": "A hare-y situation has thrown the Big Apple\u2019s infamous \u201cfake heiress\u201d Anna Delvey back in the spotlight.\n\nThe scammer-turned-model got ripped by animal lovers after several rabbits she used in a glamorous photoshoot were found dumped in Prospect Park last week.\n\nActivists quickly drew the link to Delvey, who had posted photos from the downtown Manhattan shoot at around the same time as the rescues, with the caption \u201cour bunny daycare is open.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese animals were left in a park to die right after this photoshoot. Living things are not your photo props,\u201d artist Alison Kuo commented under Delvey\u2019s Instagram post.\n\nDelvey claims she was totally oblivious, telling Page Six on Monday: \u201cI do not eat meat, and I had no involvement in the acquisition, transport, or return of these animals. I would never condone these actions.\u201d\n\nBut the same can\u2019t be said for Christian Batty, a 19-year-old assistant on the photoshoot, who wrote in a statement on social media that he \u201cpanicked\u201d when he realized he\u2019d be responsible for the floppy-eared \u201cprops.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I realized the rabbits were being surrendered to me, I panicked,\u201d he wrote in the hare-brained confession, which Delvey shared on her own Instagram account Sunday.\n\n\u201cAt 19, with no experience caring for animals \u2026 and no knowledge of available resources, I felt overwhelmed and made the worst possible choice,\u201d Batty wrote. \u201cBelieving, mistakenly, that there were existing rabbits in that area, I released them [in Prospect Park], thinking that was my best option. That belief was wrong, and I regret it deeply.\u201d\n\nThree of the abandoned bunnies are now in the foster care of animal rescuer Terry Chao, who said that she and two neighbors had rescued Parker, a harlequin lop, on August 4 and Moon, also a harlequin, three days later.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Chao said she drew was notified about Delvey\u2019s photoshoot on Saturday \u2014 and was already familiar with it because Batty had initially alerted her to see if she would lend the team her own Instagram-famous rabbit.\n\n\u201cAnon posts calling out Christian & Anna started appearing on the NYC Rabbits group & Reddit piecing the evidence together. It was undeniable these were the exact same bunnies from her shoot,\u201d Chao wrote.\n\n\u201cThe pressure worked & a confession was issued,\u201d she said, adding that Batty went to Prospect Park with her to help rescue a third missing bunny, a gray fur-ball who has since been named Joaquin, after the actor.\n\nThe trio had been obtained by Batty \u2014 a friend of Delvey\u2019s hairstylist on set \u2014 from a Yonkers woman looking to surrender her leporine models on a local Facebook group, rescuers said.\n\nA fourth rabbit, Benito, was borrowed from its owner, who wrote on Instagram that they \u201chappened to see Anna Delvey\u2019s story that she needed a bunny for a photoshoot and thought it would be nice for him to meet other rabbits.\u201d\n\nThe owner said they were told the other bunnies in the shoot \u201calso came from a loving home.\u201d\n\nBatty said the faux heiress was \u201cnot involved in anything beyond the photoshoot and did not realize the situation until today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI lied to Anna, and the rest of the team about the rabbits,\u201d Batty\u2019s statement said.\n\nDelvey, real name Anna Sorokin, once tried to scam her way to the top of New York\u2019s social scene and was convicted in 2022 of scamming banks and businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe real-life inspiration for the Netflix series \u201cInventing Anna\u201d now touts 1.1 million Instagram followers \u2013 and regularly poses with her ankle monitor since she was released from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody while she fights being deported to Germany.\n\nKathy Nizzari, of animal advocacy group Lights Out Coalition, told The Post that rabbit dumping in Prospect Park is \u201cfairly common\u201d \u2013 despite the offense carrying a punishment of up to one year in prison and/or a fine of up to $1,000, if convicted.\n\nAnimal rescue sources familiar with dumping at Prospect Park estimated at least six rabbits unrelated to the Delvey photo shoot were found last week alone.\n\n\u201cThis happens way too often \u2014 usually by pet owners \u2014 but it never occurred to me a photographer would do such a thing,\u201d said Mary Beth Artz, a local rescuer at the Brooklyn park, \u201calthough it often happens with photographers around Easter time with ducklings and chicks.\u201d\n\nEdita Birnkrant, executive director of animal advocacy group NYCLASS, called on Delvey to \u201cdonate a hefty sum to local rescue groups,\u201d naming the organization They All Want to Live.\n\nSuch groups \u201chave to go to extraordinary effort and expense to rescue, vet and rehome animals like this, who are dumped in parks and left to slowly die due to cruel and irresponsible actions of adults who should know better,\u201d Birnkrant said.",

  "summary": "Animal lovers have protested after several rabbits used in Anna Delvey's photoshoot were found dumped in Prospect Park, New York City. Activists linked the rabbits to Delvey, who had posted photos from the shoot with the caption \"our bunny daycare is open\" on Instagram. Delvey claims she was unaware of the animals' fate and had no involvement in their acquisition, transport, or return. However, her assistant, Christian Batty, a 19-year-old assistant, claimed he made the wrong decision to abandon the rabbits. Three of the abandoned bunnies are now in the foster care of animal rescuer Terry Chao, who claims they were the exact same rabbits from Delvey\u2019s shoot. The incident has sparked outrage among animal advocates and led to the resignation of Delvey and a year in prison and fine of up to $1,000.",

Her loss is deeply felt by the entire Rockingham County Public Schools (RCPS) family,\u201d a tribute on Facebook read."

A 50-second teaser gives a sneak peek into director Shonda Rhimes\u2019 multipart exploration of the notorious fraudster, which promises an upbeat TV adaption of the Russian-born German\u2019s convincing connivery.\nJulia Garner, 27, stars as the pretend socialite, who went by Anna Delvey while she swindled Manhattan\u2019s elite out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. The rest of the cast includes Laverne Cox, Arian Moayed, Katie Lowes, Alexis Floyd, Anders Holm, Anna Deavere Smith, Jeff Perry, Terry Kinney and Anna Chlumsky.\nThe show is set to premiere on Netflix on Feb. 11, 2022, and is part of Rhimes\u2019 deal with the streaming giant.\n\u201cBut is Anna New York\u2019s biggest con woman, or is she simply the new portrait of the American dream?\u201d the Netflix synopsis ponders, adding that the miniseries will significantly explore the Instagram-famous faux-blue-blood\u2019s relationship with the reporter investigating her, portrayed by Chlumsky.\nThe series is based on the convicted scammer\u2019s successful New York City social heist, for which she was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison. Sorokin was convicted in 2019 of grand larceny and other raps for stealing $200,000 from businesses and for fraudulently trying to score a $22 million loan to launch a Manhattan art club.\nHowever, Sorokin was released in February for good behavior, claiming she was a celebrity in prison, before being taken back into custody for visa issues.\nThe source material for the show will work from Jessica Pressler\u2019s New York Magazine article \u201cHow an Aspiring \u2018It\u2019 Girl Tricked New York\u2019s Party People \u2014 and its Banks.\u201d Pressler also wrote the article that inspired the 2019 Jennifer Lopez film \u201cHustlers.\u201d\nSorokin, who remains in ICE custody, insists that she had no ill will when she fooled her community, various hotels, banks and private jet operators out of all that cash.\n\u201cI never had a fraudulent intent \u2026 And I guess that\u2019s what should really count,\u201d she said in a September interview. \u201cI would like to show the world that I\u2019m not this dumb, greedy person that they portrayed me to be.\u201d\nAs for what the future holds for her, she responded, \u201cI guess it remains to be seen.\u201d"

      "text": "Bunnies abandoned in Brooklyn park after Anna Delvey photoshoot\nGet me hare and makeup!\nAnna Delvey has found herself in a scandal over some homeless bunny rabbits, Page Six ears.\nThe famed scammer-turned-model did a photo shoot over the weekend, featuring some bunnies on leashes.\nBut there was an outcry online after someone later found the very same rabbits abandonded in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park. (Delvey had posted behind-the-scenes images from the shoot on her Instagram, and a concerned local uploaded images of rabbits they\u2019d found in the park \u2014 and somehow someone noticed they were the same rabbits).\nThe trouble seems to have begun when Delvey and an up-and-coming young photographer, a hair stylist and a pal got together in a pretty ad hoc group to put together a shoot that had no specific purpose and \u2014 perhaps crucially \u2014 no specific boss.\nPhotog Jasper Soloff \u2014 who has shot stars including Dove Cameron, Tinashe, Pamela Anderson and Billie Eilish \u2014 cooked up the idea of having having Delvey walking rabbits down West Broadway in the shots.\nIt appears that someone involved in the shoot (apparently slightly over-eager to help) told the gang that they\u2019d get hold of some bunnies but \u2014 rather than using the professional animals wranglers that exist for exactly this kind of thing \u2014 they found someone online who was giving away some free rabbits in Yonkers.\nAnd then didn\u2019t know what to do with them after the snaps had been taken.\nA member of the loose group eventualy copped to turning the bunnies loose, saying that they tried to return them to the person they\u2019d got them from, but \u201cpanicked\u201d when they couldn\u2019t get in touch with the owner, and left them in the park because they \u201cbelieved, mistakenly, that there were existing rabbits in that area.\u201d\nDelvey told Page Six, \u201cI do not eat meat, and I had no involvement in the acquisition, transport, or return of these animals. I would never condone these actions.\u201d\nAfter reviewing messages between Delvey and the team behind the shoot, it does indeed appear that Delvey \u2014 who saw the rabbits for the first time when she was picked up from her apartment for the job \u2014 wasn\u2019t involved in procuring the animals, and had no reason to believe that they wouldn\u2019t be properly taken care of.\nIt appears that she only discovered something was amiss after the online kerfuffle about the saga began.\nAn attorney for Soloff today us, \u201cThis was not Jasper\u2019s photoshoot.\u201d\n\u201cJasper had no knowledge or input as to how the bunnies were obtained or what happened to them after the photo shoot,\u201d said Gary Adelman of Adelman-Matz.\n\u201cThankfully the bunnies are safe and being cared for. Jaspar is a huge animal lover, has grown up and cared for animals, such as birds, cats, dogs, parakeets, iguanas, and has a lovely dog named Tinkerbell and would never be involved in the harming of any animal,\u201d said the lawyer.\nThe leporine models are now being fostered.\nMeanwhile, paging Pixar \u2014 if you want to option this article for a movie about some suburban rabbits who, in a twist of fate, become glamorous models in New York City and end up going on a haywire adventure through the city\u2019s seedy underbelly, you know where to find us. It even has a happy ending!"

      "text": "Anna Delvey says she doesn\u2019t want to be a \u2018spectacle\u2019 with bedazzled ankle monitor\nAnna Delvey is being a \u201cpain\u201d with constant complaints about her ankle monitor, according to sources \u2014 but the \u201cFake Heiress\u201d told The Post it\u2019s not about style, she just doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cstared at\u201d when she goes out.\nDelvey \u2014 whose real name is Anna Sorokin \u2014 has been forced to wear the GPS tracker since she was released from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody on $10,000 bond in October 2022 while she fights being deported to Germany.\nAt her now-monthly ICE check-ins in New York, Delvey, 33, has been a \u201cpain in the ass,\u201d apparently complaining the device is \u201cnot fashionable,\u201d according to US Department of Homeland Security sources.\nBut Delvey \u2014 who was the inspiration for Netflix series \u201cInventing Anna\u201d \u2014 insisted that she just doesn\u2019t want the \u201cspectacle\u201d that comes with wearing an ankle monitor.\n\u201cEvery time I go out, what\u2019s being written is I\u2019m sporting the ankle bracelet or I\u2019m flaunting it,\u201d Delvey said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t seem to want to acknowledge that I don\u2019t have a choice but to wear it.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s just like I would not want to make such a spectacle out of this. I would love to be able to go out, and not be stared at or like not every delivery person asking me if I killed my husband, or something.\u201d\nStill, Delvey has taken to blinging out her ankle monitor, and one ICE source derisively calling her the \u201cbedazzled b\u2014h.\u201d\nOn her way to a court appearance in June, Delvey \u2014 who is also fighting a 2019 grand larceny conviction for conning well-heeled New Yorkers and businesses out of $250,000 while posing as a German aristocrat \u2014 sported the letter \u201cA\u201d in rhinestones on her ankle bracelet.\nDelvey is not allowed to bedazzle the gear, but was not specifically told she couldn\u2019t do so, according to sources familiar with ICE\u2019s monitoring program.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wearing one for almost two years. I think, once or twice, it\u2019s my right to bedazzle it,\u201d she said tongue-in-cheek, during a video interview Thursday from her business partner Kelly Cutrone\u2019s house upstate in Cold Spring, NY.\nDelvey said the jewels, \u201ccome off after one shower and they don\u2019t interfere with anything and don\u2019t damage the bracelet.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the ankle bracelet is a bad look necessarily. I think whenever I wear it I\u2019m able to make it work,\u201d she added.\n\u201cI think the biggest hurdle is the over knee boots but the fall season is still upon us. So far I\u2019ve had bigger issues to worry about.\u201d\nShe\u2019s asked ICE to provide her with a newer and more subtle alternative \u2014 the VeriWatch wrist tacker.\nBut ICE rejected her request because the judge who set her bond conditions specifically ordered her to wear an ankle monitor, she claimed.\nDelvey said she plans to discuss with her lawyers potentially making a motion to the judge to swap the ankle contraption for a wrist one.\nShe said people associate ankle bracelets in pop culture with Lindsay Lohan \u2014 who infamously had to wear one for driving drunk \u2014 and don\u2019t realize that someone can be saddled with one as part of an immigration case.\n\u201cEverybody just assumes the worst,\u201d Delvey said.\n\u201cBut it was the least [important] thing on my list of asks,\u201d she noted.\nThe so-called SoHo scammer has been pushing for fewer restrictions while she fights deportation and recently clinched wins when she was granted a social security number and the right to be able to work in the US, Page Six reported Wednesday.\nShe was also granted the right to be able to travel within a 75-mile radius of her home, which currently is about 60 miles from New York City.\nDelvey also successfully petitioned the immigration judge to allow her to use social media again after claiming it violated her right to free speech.\nBut the question of whether she will ultimately be allowed to stay in the country long-term is still up in the air, as is whether her conviction \u2014 for which she served two years in prison \u2014 will be upheld.\n\u201cI feel like I have spent the majority of my adult life in the states,\u201d Delvey explained of why she continues to fight deportation.\n\u201cAll of my friends are here. All of my projects and everything I\u2019ve been working on are here. And it would be extremely difficult for me to ever come back if I were to leave.\u201d\nSoon after Delvey served her prison sentence and was released on Feb. 11, 2021, ICE swept her up and put her behind bars for another 18 months for overstaying her visa.\nShe was then released to home confinement to her East Village apartment in October 2022 and was only allowed to leave for her then-weekly check-ins.\n\u201cI was great to be in the middle of things but also all I was able to do is to have people come over, and it started feeling like a zoo,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was fun for a bit for the first couple of months, but then it just became really taxing, especially [because] my building did not have many amenities, and it seemed like it made total sense to move upstate for a bit.\u201d\nWith her ICE check-ins now being monthly and her gaining the ability to travel in the state, Delvey can carry out work for her new \u201cpop up\u201d fashion PR company with Cutrone called OutLaw Agency.\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited for the fashion week. We have so many things in the works. And yeah, we\u2019re just working nonstop. It\u2019s the busy season,\u201d Delvey said.\nAfter the budding publicist gets through New York fashion week next month, she said she will look for a new Manhattan apartment that isn\u2019t like the \u201cprison\u201d of her old pad where she was confined for over a year-and-a-half.\n\u201cIts a different feel to be able to leave your apartment,\u201d Devley said of whatever new place she moves to. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be moving into a new prison.\u201d\nDelvey said her criminal conviction would likely negatively impact her ability to come back to the US if she were to lose her deportation case and be kicked out of the US.\nAnd since she overstayed a visa waiver in the time before she was arrested, there would be an automatic 10 year ban on her return.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a difficult case and quite a challenge,\u201d Delvey said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard so many \u2018No\u2019s\u2019 from legal teams and so many people who told me that I\u2019m never going to get out of jail back when I was in ICE custody, and I should just stop wasting my time and stop wasting my money and go to Europe and live my life and it feels great to prove people wrong.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown \u2014 and warns NYC could be next\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 and warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitian Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending the authority.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump cited many high-profile recent crimes in the capital, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the near-fatal stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals lawlessly cruising about town on unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too\u2026I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, teasing apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nDC officials say they won\u2019t resist\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser, an elected Democrat, confirmed Monday afternoon that she would comply with the federal takeover.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work every day to make sure it\u2019s not a complete disaster, let me put it that way,\u201d Bowser said at her own press conference, at which she called Trump\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point is this: Everybody should follow the law, the police and the community. And that\u2019s the case now, it was the case last week and it was the case the week before,\u201d she said.\nThe mayor added that she was particularly concerned that \u201call law enforcement be identifiable by uniform, a badge, a jacket, so that people know that they are law enforcement.\u201d\nTrump first ordered federal officials, including members of the FBI, DEA and Border Patrol, onto the streets of DC the night of Aug. 7-8. Photos circulating on social media and in the press showed those agents wearing clearly identifying uniforms.\nMPD Chief Pamela Smith confirmed she had a meeting set for later Monday with two federal officials, whom she did not name, about next steps.\nSmith added she was interested in receiving help to enforce outstanding warrants for criminal suspects, saying there are \u201cthings that the federal government is also very useful for.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be an opportunity for us to come together and collaborate on being able to go out and execute warrants,\u201d the police chief said.\nAhead of Trump\u2019s announcement, Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday that \u201cwe do need the federal government\u2019s help\u201d and specifically requested assistance rebuilding the city jail.\nBowser recently invoked curfews in parts of the city in a bid to keep teens off the street as early as 7 p.m., but also has claimed crime rates are going down in the city, pointing to official data.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that DC police commander Michael Pulliam, whose district included the densely populated Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPulliam\u2019s police union defended him and accused MPD leadership of ordering subordinates to falsify violent crime data.\nDC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton endorsed Trump\u2019s takeover, saying in a Fox News interview: \u201cWe completely agree with the president that crime in the District of Columbia is out of control and something needs to be done with it.\u201d\nNew York, Chicago, LA in crosshairs\nTrump announced at his press conference that other cities may be next, saying at one point that \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while\u201d \u2014 and also name-checking Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting very strongly with DC, and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly as they say.\u201d\nTrump additionally announced plans for federal legislation that would override state laws barring judges from applying cash bail requirements to criminal defendants.\nIf necessary, Trump added, ordinary military members could be deployed to join the National Guard and the local cops.\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump summed up his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"
