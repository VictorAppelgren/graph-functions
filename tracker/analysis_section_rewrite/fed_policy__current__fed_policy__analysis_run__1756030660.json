      "feedback": "Strong start on 0–3 weeks framing, but needs a tighter, counterbalanced, world-class upgrade. The causal chain should be sharpened from policy signals (Jackson Hole easing tilt and BoJ wage‑growth pickup) to cross‑asset risk appetite, to named names (JOBY, OPEN) price action, to valuation readthrough, with explicit invalidation rules. Actionable edits in one compact paragraph: (1) rebuild as a crisp base/bull/bear scenario set anchored to concrete policy catalysts in the sources (e.g., Jackson Hole easing tilt cited for Fed sentiment; Ueda’s Jackson Hole remarks signaling potential later BoJ hikes; Trump’s political risk as a separate macro risk). (2) add a tight transmission mechanism map: policy signal → funding/discount rates or risk premia → multiples and flows into high‑beta equities (JOBY, OPEN) → immediate price and volatility responses; tie this to the observed moves (JOBY +125% last quarter; OPEN +636% last quarter) and to the valuation gaps (JOBY PB 14.2x with a 12‑month target of 10.83; OPEN at 5.01 with a 12‑month target of 1.39). (3) crystallize levels and invalidation: specify explicit watch levels and what constitutes invalidation; e.g., base case remains valid while JOBY/OPEN hold above the analyst‑target thresholds (JOBY: fair value target 10.83; OPEN: target 1.39). A break below those thresholds would invalidate the long‑bias scenario; additional near‑term triggers to monitor include Jackson Hole communications for Fed path and any BoJ wage/price signals, plus the next earnings/guidance updates for JOBY and OPEN; (4) demand precise quantification, not generic statements: cite exact numbers from sources (JOBY price 14.95, 1Y return 192.56%, PB 14.2x; OPEN price 5.01, target 1.39, debt/equity ~344.8%, 1Y return 122.67%); (5) expand monitoring to reflect cross‑asset and cross‑border risk: BoJ wage growth and potential rate moves (K0WFSW29E), U.S. policy cues (TXVQ5ZQ0N, H9WSBYP3D), and the consumer/credit context from S7M6BJSRT on loan costs (origination 1–8%, fixed vs variable, APR vs rate). (6) fix formatting and ensure each assertion ties to a cited source; avoid conflating finance‑sector anecdotes with policy drivers. With these edits, the piece will deliver a coherent, first‑principles-driven 0–3 week view, explicit catalysts and thresholds, a clear three‑scenario framework, and a tightly sourced, numerically grounded set of levels to watch next.
