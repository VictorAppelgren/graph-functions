  "description": "Monster Hunter Wilds' director wanted Omega in the game",
  "content": "\u2022 Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki Yoshida says Omega will appear in the Monster Hunter Wilds crossover because the game's director wanted it to happen\n\u2022 Yoshida also says there are many Final Fantasy 14 players on the Monster Hunter team\n\u2022 The upcoming Omega Planetes boss was designed for both casual players and hardcore players\n\nAccording to Final Fantasy 14's director, Naoki Yoshida, Monster Hunter Wilds' upcoming collaboration with the MMO will feature Omega because the Monster Hunter team wanted it to happen.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with TechRadar Gaming at Gamescom 2025, Yoshida explained in pretty simple terms why the crossover will feature the automaton as opposed to a fantasy creature like Final Fantasy 14's Shinryu or Nidhogg.\n\nIt turns out, Monster Hunter Wilds' director Yuya Tokuda and executive director Kaname Fujioka wanted Omega to make an appearance because they wanted to explore a new worldview in the game.\n\n\"The first and foremost, the people who said that they really want Omega to make an appearance was the Monster Hunter team,\" Yoshida said.\n\n\"So, with regards to the reason why that is, it just so happens that last year at Gamescom, I went out drinking with Mr. Tokuda, who's the director of Monster Hunter Wilds, and also Mr. Fujioka, who's the executive director for the game platform. They told me that in they wanted to achieve a sort of world view which behind it there lies an unknown civilization and it's a little bit different to Monster Hunter, what you could see in Monster Hunter before, and for that reason they wanted Omega to make an appearance because it would expand on that world view which they have in the game and that battle experience.\"\n\nYoshida added, \"And also at the same time in the Monster Hunter team, there are many Warriors of Light as well, similar to all of the players, and they remember the experiences they had battling Omega in Final Fantasy.\"\n\nIf you're familiar with Final Fantasy 14's Omega raid series, you'll know that the backstory of Omega and its questline is considered be quite sad. For this reason, some changes have been made for when the automaton makes an appearance in Monster Hunter Wilds, although some mechanics will remain familiar.\n\n\"They wanted to kind of replicate that sort of experience in the game, so of course, there are certain mechanics, for example, and so they wanted to see how they could create that sort of experience within the game,\" Yoshida explained.\n\n\"As Final Fantasy 14 players, when we think about what happened with the battle with Omega, we think about the Warrior of Light had the battle with Omega, and then we remember that there was that small Omega that we have now, which has, we could think of it that it has a heart and it travels around with Alpha the Chocobo, and so from the Final Fantasy 14 player's perspective, if they were to battle Omega, they might not be able to attack Omega because they they would feel bad and they would feel sorry for attacking the Omega that they know.\n\n\"And it's for this reason why we decided that in the content that will be implemented in Monster Hunter Wilds, it would be the same body of Omega, but inside it would be a different AI as it were, and that's the reason why the Omega monster in Monster Hunter Wilds is called Omega Planetes, and in terms of the story, in the collaboration content on Monster Hunter Wilds side, the Alpha and Omega will make an appearance, and they will join the hunter as they go up against Omega Planetes, and you can look forward to the reason why that happens in the story.\"\n\nIn addition, Yoshida said that the Final Fantasy 14 development team has been in charge of supervising the story and thinks it will be an enjoyable experience for both communities.\n\nThe director also confirmed that when it comes down to battle mechanics, the fight against Omega Planetes was designed for both casual players and hardcore players in mind.\n\nThe collaboration was announced as part of Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live. More details, including a release date for the crossover, is expected to be announced at a later date along with information about the Free Title Update 3.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Here are the three biggest things we learned from the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date trailer\n\u2022 Everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 from the Sekiro anime to the new Ghost of Yotei mode\n\u2022 New Resident Evil Requiem gameplay teaser solidifies it as my most anticipated game of 2026 so far",

      "text": "Here are the three biggest things we learned from the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date trailer\nThe game finally arrives next month\nIn case you missed the long-awaited announcement, Hollow Knight: Silksong officially launches next month on September 4.\nDeveloper Team Cherry also shared a full-length gameplay trailer showcasing some familiar things we already knew about the Metroidvania indie, along with a few interesting titbits that hadn't been revealed until now.\nI've selected the top three things that stood out to me, so let's break them down.\nA new crafting system\nThe first thing that stood out from the trailer was what appears to be a new crafting system. The first Hollow Knight game didn't offer this feature at all, and instead had multiple shops around the map where players could obtain new items, or they could upgrade their primary weapon, the Nail, by talking to a smith.\nFrom the brief gameplay snippet, it looks like players will be able to craft a number of items, including handy gadgets, such as a Sting Shard, which is described as a \"vicious stabbing trap\", a Magma Bell that \"wards against the deadly lava and heat\", and even a portable Crafting Kit that will allow players to \"craft finer, sharper, and deadlier tools... if that is your wish\".\nPlayers will need various materials for each item, as well as Rosaries, Silksong's new form of currency.\nVarious locations to discover\nThough it was quick, the trailer also gave us with a first look at the game's world map. Silksong takes place in the kingdom of Pharloom, ruled by silk and song - hence the name!\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLike the previous game, players will be advancing through various lands, only this time they'll uncover a new kingdom filled with coral forests, mossy grottos, gilded cities, and misted moors as they ascend to the shining citadel.\nNow we have an idea of where some of those places will be and what they will be called, including the Deep Docks, Hunter's March, Greymoor, The Marrow, Bellhart, Shellwood, Bone Bottom, and more.\nThe map can only be seen for a few seconds in the trailer, but it looks like it will be expanded in each direction the more the player explores.\nAn abundance of boss fights\nBy far the most exciting part of the trailer was the reveal of how many enemy encounters Silksong will have. According to Team Cherry, there will be over 200 foes to battle, as well as \"over 40 legendary bosses\" to vanquish.\nThough a specific number wasn't shared, we're expecting Silksong to feature at least as many boss fights as Hollow Knight did in its base game, which was 47 in total, counting the variations.\nWe even got a brief look at a few in the trailer, including a pair of cockroach-like enemies, a giant toad that can suck Hornet in with its breath, a scorpion with giant pincers, and more.\nWhen Hollow Knight: Silksong launches next month, it will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, Asus ROG Xbox Ally, and ROG Xbox Ally X.\nYou might also like...\n- Everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 from the Sekiro anime to the new Ghost of Yotei mode\n- New Resident Evil Requiem gameplay teaser solidifies it as my most anticipated game of 2026 so far\n- The Hollow Knight: Silksong appearance at Opening Night Live 2025 was disappointing, but thankfully there's more information on the way\nDemi is a freelance games journalist for TechRadar Gaming.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nComing off the back of two legendary expansions, Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail has its work cut out for it. Thankfully, it\u2019s a superb foundational expansion that evolves the world of the game in meaningful ways with a main scenario quest line chock full of excellent characters and phenomenal, culturally-rich worldbuilding. Even early on, content is some of the most engaging it\u2019s been in years, with phenomenal dungeon, raid, and trial design.\nPros\n- +\nExcellent main scenario with wonderful characters\n- +\nNew jobs are very welcome additions\n- +\nEngaging and challenging encounter design\n- +\nBreathtaking graphical improvements\n- +\nAnother phenomenal soundtrack (thanks, Soken)\nCons\n- -\nMain story pace occasionally drops off\n- -\nOverall progression remains largely unchanged\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nPlatform reviewed: PC\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S\nRelease date: July 2, 2024\nFinal Fantasy 14: Dawntrail is the fifth major expansion for the increasingly popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), and for many of us who are caught up in terms of story and content, it\u2019s one that has some impossibly large shoes to fill.\nIn terms of story at least, Dawntrail is coming off the back of two unequivocally legendary expansions in Shadowbringers (2019) and Endwalker (2021). The former launched the game\u2019s popularity into the stratosphere, while the latter wrapped up the decade-long Hydaelyn/Zodiark saga with terrifyingly high stakes and arguably one of the most satisfying conclusions in gaming history.\nDawntrail isn\u2019t that, opting instead to kick off a brand new story arc in an entirely new region far to the west. And honestly, that\u2019s perfectly okay. If you go in with the right expectations, Dawntrail still provides an incredibly fulfilling main scenario experience, rich with incredible worldbuilding, infectiously likable characters and a focus on a diverse range of cultures and their histories. While not quite as expertly paced as those two expansions that came before it, I once again felt beyond satisfied once the credits had rolled.\nWhere Dawntrail has other expansions beat, however, is in the quality of its encounter design and the noticeably higher challenge provided by even the non-high level content. While never back-breakingly hard (outside of Extreme trials and Savage raids, that is), you nonetheless have to dial in much more frequently. As a result, I\u2019m extremely confident in the direction Creative Studio 3 has opted to take here, and I can\u2019t wait for Dawntrail to be expanded in future patches.\nGo west\nDawntrail takes you, the Warrior of Light, to an entire continent you\u2019ve yet to explore: Tural. Quite unlike large swathes of Eorzea - where everyone sounds like they\u2019re from Wigan - Tural is a veritable cultural hotpot strongly inspired by various South American regions. The sprawling capital city of Tuliyollal is where your journey begins after a particularly perilous trip across the seas.\nIn Dawntrail, your goal is to aid Wuk Lamat, one of four claimants to Tuliyollal\u2019s throne in its rite of succession. Objectives are twofold here; in order for Wuk Lamat to become Dawnservant, you must help her locate the legendary city of gold which her father - the current sitting ruler - discovered the gateway to decades ago.\nOf course, this is far easier said than done. Opening the entrance to the golden city first requires you to find seven keystones entrusted to several cultural figureheads across Tural. By completing their tasks, you'll earn those keystones.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhile nearly every aspect of Dawntrail forms a complete and satisfying whole, my favorite addition has to be the Pictomancer job. As a previous Red Mage and Summoner main, I feel Pictomancer is the most unique and most fun casting job Final Fantasy 14 has had to date. I\u2019m strongly considering making it my main job for Savage raid progression.\nBut as mentioned, this is a four-way race, and those other three are equally as keen on becoming Dawnservant as Wuk Lamat is. First there\u2019s Koana, Wuk\u2019s adopted brother who spent much of his life studying to the east in Sharlayan. As a result, he\u2019s incredibly sharp-minded, and wishes to utilize Sharlayan\u2019s technologies to help Tural prosper.\nThen there\u2019s Zoraal Ja, the current ruler\u2019s son and a man of very few words. Driven by pure ambition, Zoraal Ja makes for a terrifying presence during the rite of succession\u2019s various trials. Lastly, there\u2019s Bakool Ja Ja, something of a scoundrel who typically resorts to underhanded tactics to eke out every advantage he can.\nThere\u2019s a rich tapestry of characters here, but Dawntrail makes it clear that Wuk Lamat is the expansion\u2019s protagonist - and it\u2019s one of the smartest things Creative Studio 3 has done here with Dawntrail\u2019s plot. Initially, Wuk Lamat comes across as very naive and inexperienced despite her heart of gold.\nWhile some may find this to be irksome, she\u2019s also a distinctly human character; she\u2019s afraid of heights, gets seasick and has a serious case of imposter syndrome. However, she grows exponentially over the course of the story. Wuk\u2019s passion for her country and love of her people is what gives her an edge over the competition. And crucially, she learns to recognize when people cannot be reasoned with, and becomes unafraid to perform drastic actions should the need arise. I think she\u2019s a wonderful addition to Final Fantasy 14\u2019s cast and I hope she sticks around for the long run.\nTo go any further would spoil Dawntrail\u2019s story, but despite the seemingly lower stakes, the narrative is filled with its own twists and turns that form an unpredictable and entertaining plot, despite the occasional stint where the story\u2019s pacing tends to drop off a little.\nThis pace is the weakest aspect of Dawntrail\u2019s main scenario. It\u2019s by no means awful, mind, but it\u2019s a little more uneven than Shadowbringers and Endwalker.\nLet me paint a picture\nAs with prior expansions, Dawntrail adds two new playable jobs (or classes for the uninitiated). This time we have two new damage-dealing jobs that add plenty of flair to the game. First is the melee DPS, Viper, which makes use of twin swords that can be combined into a single double-edged blade.\nViper can feel incredibly busy at first, with multiple combos, buffs and debuffs to maintain uptime on. It\u2019s also a relatively fast-paced job, even by melee DPS standards, leading to a playstyle that\u2019s both rapid and demanding. Thankfully, it is still fairly navigable; a yellow border around skills on your hotbar indicates which button you should be pressing next. This makes it very easy to keep track of fights while keeping your hotbars in your peripheral vision.\nThe second new job - and my favorite of the two - is Pictomancer. This is a casting DPS that utilizes aether-infused paint and motifs to deal damage and provide buffs to allies. Like Viper, Pictomancer initially seems more complex than it actually is, especially as its rotation is a bit more free-flowing than most other DPS roles. But after a little practice, you\u2019ll be quite literally painting up a storm in no time.\nAs usual, a number of existing jobs have also received updates and - in some cases - major reworks. Monk, for example, feels excellent now thanks to a smart streamlining of its rotation. Instead of needing to upkeep a damage buff and a damage-over-time effect, one of your combos now generates orb stacks that effectively power up your more hard-hitting skills. On top of that, additional utility has been granted in the form of two extremely powerful ranged attacks.\nHealer job Astrologian has also had a much-needed rework. Its card drawing system now has some additional depth, and there\u2019s much more utility. Additionally, Astros now have two stacks of Lightspeed on a shorter cooldown, allowing them to instantly cast both damage and healing abilities more frequently.\nThe broader picture is that now, at Level 100, most of Final Fantasy 14\u2019s jobs are beginning to feel somewhat complete. For example, jobs like Warrior and Reaper have seen very little changes outside of one or two new abilities or burst phase enders. The only real dud I\u2019ve noticed is Summoner, which feels largely unchanged from its controversial Endwalker rework outside of the new form for Bahamut. Summoner, I feel, definitely could use more juice and I hope Creative Studio 3 considers looking over the job in future patches.\nLocked in\nDawntrail\u2019s launch features all the party-based content we\u2019ve come to expect from a new expansion: eight four-player dungeons (three of which are max level \u2018Expert\u2019 dungeons), three eight-player trials (essentially large-scale boss encounters, two of which have \u2018Extreme\u2019 difficulty variants) and the first of three eight-player raid tiers (which contains four boss fights with \u2018Normal\u2019 and \u2018Savage\u2019 variants).\nProgression, then, isn\u2019t anything we haven\u2019t seen before. That may be frustrating to some players hoping for something a little different as we kick off a brand new story arc for Final Fantasy 14. However, I feel this setup does play to this expansion\u2019s benefit, especially as the overall challenge has seen a noticeable uptick at the casual level. Around the time you reach the Level 95 dungeon, you\u2019ll definitely feel like you have to lock in more as bosses begin throwing out more creative mechanics. It leads to a latter half that\u2019s genuinely thrilling, without ever treading into unfair territory.\nThe Level 100 Expert dungeons, especially, surprised me with their difficulty compared to Endwalker\u2019s. You have to learn and pay attention, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for parties to get caught up on a boss or two during progression. Should you fail, you can now respawn directly outside the boss room which is a huge timesaver and a smart way to eliminate the previous \u2018walk of shame\u2019 - which had players trudge through an entire empty section of dungeon just to get back to a boss.\nThis steeper difficulty also applies to Dawntrail\u2019s eight-player raid series; The Arcadion. Set up to be a quintessential tournament arc for our Warrior of Light, this first tier features four fights with some wonderfully inventive mechanics. As an example, the first encounter\u2019s boss begins to break the brittle platforms beneath them partway into the fight. Next, they target a player whom they\u2019ll launch into the air after a few seconds. Said player will need to adjust their position so that, after being launched, they land on a tile that hasn\u2019t been broken. Otherwise, they\u2019ll plummet to their death. It\u2019s a brilliantly thematic mechanic that really helps set the tone of the raid going forward.\nThe sights and sounds\nLastly, I\u2019d be remiss to not talk about the graphical overhaul that\u2019s arrived as of Dawntrail\u2019s release. The fundamental look of the game hasn\u2019t changed much, but a much-needed upgrade to lighting, shadows and texture quality allow for a jaw-dropping facelift.\nIt\u2019s partly why I\u2019m glad that Dawntrail\u2019s initial zones are relatively realistic in their design. The jungles of Kozama\u2019uka, the rocky mounts of Urqopacha, and the swampy forests of Yak\u2019tel all look breathtaking thanks to the overhaul. Certain weather conditions, like rain, are especially slick here, with light realistically bouncing off of wet surfaces.\nIt\u2019s not just the new Dawntrail zones that have seen this upgrade, either. Checking out some older content, I was amazed by how much the overhaul has transformed some areas. While many locations have only received a light touch, dungeons like Syrcus Tower have received such an impressive upgrade that I almost didn\u2019t recognize them at first.\nCharacter models have seen a significant upgrade, too. Light interacts with skin more naturally than before. The au ra race\u2019s horns are far more detailed, and touches like the way light shines through the softer parts of ears is wonderful attention to detail.\nAnd of course, composer Masayoshi Soken has provided a near-immaculate soundtrack for the expansion; Dawntrail features some of his best work yet. New town and zone themes are some of my favorites to date, and later dungeon and trial themes are particularly hard-hitting, spanning orchestral, metal and drum-and-bass genres.\nAccessibility\nFinal Fantasy 14 in general offers numerous accessibility settings through its options menus. Your heads-up-display (HUD) can be fully customized for size, opacity and even complexity. UI elements such as player, NPC and enemy names can also be color-coded to your liking as well.\nElsewhere, in the dedicated accessibility settings tab, there are options for clear visual alerts and three distinct colorblind filters (protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia).\nFinally, Final Fantasy 14 has full controller support across consoles and PC, with a dedicated 'cross hotbar' system designed around the face buttons, d-pad and triggers. PlayStation controllers including the DualSense and DualShock 4 also have touchpad support, allowing you to control a mouse cursor with the controller. Finally, holding LB/L1 and pressing in the right stick brings up a virtual mouse which can be moved with the analog stick and left/right click is assigned to the triggers.\nShould I play Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail?\nPlay it if...\nYou\u2019re all caught up with the story so far\nIn this case, you\u2019re already invested in the Final Fantasy 14 experience, and Dawntrail provides yet another high-quality expansion with an exceptional main scenario and deeply engaging content.\nYou want to be surprised\nWithout spoiling anything, Dawntrail\u2019s second half is astonishing in its creativity, and the writers maintain the ability to present mature themes in some incredibly impactful ways.\nDon't play it if...\nYou\u2019re just getting started\nWell, here it\u2019s probably more accurate to say that you can\u2019t play Dawntrail. At least not before playing through the base game and the four expansions before it.\nHow we reviewed Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail\nAs was the case with prior expansions, it took me roughly 30 hours to clear Dawntrail\u2019s main scenario quest line. This took my Monk job from Level 90 to the new maximum of Level 100. Upon clearing, I went back and leveled more of my favorite jobs including Reaper, Warrior, Pictomancer, and Astrologian to get a feel for their changes and what the new vocations bring to the game.\nBefore going ahead with this review, I also made sure to wait for The Arcadion raid tier to be released, which came two weeks after the expansion\u2019s launch. Since then, I\u2019ve cleared the \u2018Normal\u2019 mode version of the raid tier each week for the weekly rewards, played almost every day to earn tomestone currency for better gear, and have successfully completed the first of two Extreme trials.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nMonster Hunter Wilds is a bold and bustling continuation of its predecessor\u2019s approach to streamlining the once-niche series. By stripping away some of the more frustrating elements of the past, and focusing on getting players into hunts as quickly as possible, Monster Hunter Wilds has the potential to launch the series to new heights. Aside from some head-scratching omissions, Monster Hunter Wilds is a collection of the greatest hits from past games, one that finally delivers on the promise of a truly vibrant and living open world.\nPros\n- +\nSeamless open world\n- +\nSeasonal changes are breathtaking to behold\n- +\nCampaign is all killer, no filler\n- +\nBringing along a second weapon is a true game-changer\n- +\nNew Focus Mode is the best addition in over a decade\nCons\n- -\nLack of a central hub does rob the game of some charm\n- -\nVisuals can be inconsistent with some areas looking washed out.\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nMonster Hunter Wilds has some rather big shoes to fill. For one, it\u2019s the sequel to the record-breaking blockbuster that was Monster Hunter World, a game that saw the long-running, and oftentimes niche franchise reach a whole new group of altogether more mainstream gamers. It also follows Monster Hunter Rise, which, while not as big as World, was extremely successful as an originally exclusive Nintendo Switch game, and introduced a host of new traversal systems.\nPlatform reviewed: PS5 Pro\nAvailable on: Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, PC, PS5\nRelease date: February 28, 2025\nIn many ways, Wilds has had to walk a tightrope between the approaches showcased in previous games, providing something for the new fans, while appealing to those that have stuck around over the past 20 years. By streamlining the formula that shined bright in Monster Hunter World, and by finally offering a seamless open world, Monster Hunter Wilds manages to hit all of the right notes, while avoiding some of the more frustrating elements that have plagued the series since its inception.\nLet's skip to the good part\nLoading up a brand new Monster Hunter game is usually a mixed experience. To truly access the really good stuff, that being the High Rank endgame content, you need to first beat the campaign. In the past couple of games, this has been easy enough, though the shoehorned systems present in Monster Hunter Rise (Rampage Mode), and Monster Hunter World (colossal Elder monster battles) really dragged things out, extending the runtime of stories that were fun, but forgettable.\nMonster Hunter Wilds is an entirely different beast with regards to its campaign, which is streamlined, slight, and punchy. For one, there\u2019s no \u2018gimmick\u2019 to speak of, with the headline feature being the seamless open world with dynamic seasons and wildlife. There are no on-rails giant monster battles, no filler quests spent in quasi-tower-defense modes, just epic monster hunts, one after the other. One annoying side character aside, this is the best Monster Hunter campaign ever, punctuated by a final boss fight that\u2019s already among my all-time favorites in all of gaming.\nThe reverence that Monster Hunter Wilds shows for every single one of its monsters shines through from the very beginning. Doshaguma, a monster featured in the beta, and one that wasn\u2019t particularly interesting at first, is introduced into the main game with an exhilarating sequence, as lightning sparks all around, and other monsters come to join in on the hunt. Several moments like these bookend other major hunts in the campaign, with every single main fight being a show-stopping event.\nThe Monster Hunter Wilds campaign is a globe-trotting adventure that encourages you to spend as little time in your base camp as possible. There\u2019s still fun to be found in crafting new gear, building new loadouts, and specializing your Item Pouch, but largely, you\u2019ll be encouraged to be out and about as much as possible.\nOne casualty of expanding the open world to include multiple hub villages is that the main hub, which you\u2019ll have seen if you played the beta, doesn\u2019t really measure up to the more dedicated locales like Astera, found in previous games. Much more focus has been applied to Pop-Up Camps, with Monster Hunter Wilds once again encouraging the player to set out and claim small pieces of the world outside, rather than get too settled at the ramshackle Base Camp in the Windward Plains. It\u2019s a strange choice, though one that does tie into the game\u2019s overall mantra. Cooking a meal in your camp just isn\u2019t as fun as watching a team of Palico chefs preparing dishes for you back at Kamura Village or Astera, however.\nSomeone call Attenborough\nThe vast open world of Monster Hunter Wilds is the main draw that sets the game aside from its predecessors. For the first time in the series, the map is an interconnected, seamless, and dynamic one. From camp, to hunt, to Field Investigations, there are no menus or loading screens getting in your way as you adventure. Of the handful of different regions that make up the world around you, each is visually distinct from one another, fostering its own specific collection of flora, fauna, and resources. Not only that but there are seasons to reckon with here as well. Fallow will strip away some of the biodiversity of a region, turning areas like the Windward Plains into dusty deserts, populated by only the hardiest of creatures.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nInclemency then rolls in, bringing sandstorms, riling up certain insects to boost passive effects that can be used on a hunt, and in some cases, completely changing the landscape. After the storm clouds fade, the season of Plenty comes about, and let me tell you, the change in conditions are seriously impressive. Gone are the barren dry lands of the Fallow, and the cloudy skies of Inclemency, as you look out over an Edenic environment teeming with creatures.\nThe campaign does a masterful job of leading you through this cycle for the first time, and the sheer dynamism of the world never really loses its charm. This doubling down on creating a living, breathing natural world follows the path laid in Monster Hunter World. This time though, the variety in the life that occupies each region is genuinely breathtaking.\nOnce I was given the freedom to explore at my leisure, I spent hours simply riding through each region, watching as small monsters and other endemic animals went about their routines. Pink-furred apes snooze peacefully in the sun, small birds can be seen riding on the backs of large reptiles, pecking and pruning as they go. Whether you\u2019re there to witness it or not, there\u2019s a natural cycle to the world of Wilds, and meticulous detail, from the huge raptors that soar in the sky, to the lines of tiny leaf-cutting ants that walk in formation across the branches of trees. You can practically hear David Attenborough narrating the whole thing.\nA story of seasons\nMonster Hunter games are rarely praised for their graphical fidelity, as they tend to put more resources into dynamic worlds and overlapping systems than boosting the resolution. Thankfully, Monster Hunter Wilds is very impressive to behold, though like a lot of other modern games this generation, does have some issues with looking washed out in certain environments. Some regions like the forest are impossibly dense, and I was regularly taken aback by just how many small monsters could be on screen at once. In fact, entire herds can be seen in some moments, running alongside large monsters as you give chase.\nPerformance-wise, the game runs smoothly on PlayStation 5 Pro, especially in the Prioritize Framerate mode. There is quite a hit to visual fidelity, but with how frenetic fights can get, you\u2019re going to want those 60 frames per second (fps). What Monster Hunter Wilds may lack slightly in pure graphical prowess, it more than makes up for in the way its seasons change the world. Atmospheric fog effects, dust clouds that precede huge sandstorms, and puddles that follow the heavy rain all look spectacular, refreshing the palette with a complete change of scenery just before any one locale starts to overstay its welcome.\nFocus, Hunter!\nMonster Hunter Rise introduced a bunch of new systems into the mix, primarily focused on speeding up traversal, and the overall mobility of hunters. In this respect, Monster Hunter Wilds does feel a little bit limited in comparison, and it took me a few hours to adjust to the fact that I didn\u2019t have my Wirebugs or Switch attacks on me anymore.\nThe Seikret, your trusty mount, is on par with the Palamute from Rise in terms of speed and does have a glide ability that\u2019s a neat addition, though functionally pretty useless. Seikrets don\u2019t help you in battle directly, but your Palico is still there to provide support if you hunt solo. If you\u2019d rather not squad up with other players, non-player character (NPC) Hunters can be called into Hunts, a feature that absolutely needs to become a staple for the series moving forward. Overall, combat is faster than in World, and decidedly flashier, though don\u2019t expect to be darting around in the air all that much, or pulling off acrobatic spinning finishers with every weapon like in Rise.\nPerhaps the biggest game-changer is the ability to bring two weapons into battle with you. As a Long Sword main, I finally started to experiment with Bowguns, and even the Hunting Horn, largely due to how easy and fast it is to swap and experiment with new weapons. After a few hours, I was trying different combinations to best counter a particular monster\u2019s moveset, experimenting with the Hunting Horn\u2019s weaponized jazz while applying status effects to my allies.\nIt\u2019s easier than ever to try out each of the 14 weapons on offer in Monster Hunter Wilds, and I\u2019d wager that many players will be encouraged to put down their old faithfuls to give some of the weirder loadouts a whirl. Focus Mode switches up the way Hunts play out too. Now, you can hold down the left trigger and aim your weapon, landing hits in the direction of your choice. This is the kind of addition that makes you wonder how it wasn\u2019t included sooner, giving previously awkward weapons like the Hammer new maneuverability and depth. Focus Mode also ties into the new Wounds system, which sees glowing red spots appear on monsters after you\u2019ve done damage to certain areas. Focus Strikes hone in on these weak spots, triggering dazzling special moves that in some cases, like the Insect Glaive, can add final flourishes to tried and tested combos.\nMonster Hunter Wilds introduces Offset attacks, which can be used to stun monsters if timed while a monster is attacking. It also adds Power Clashes, which trigger when you\u2019ve achieved a succession of Perfect Guards. The latter is a real sight to behold, as your target rams its head into the guard of your weapon, and you\u2019re forced to push it off, stunning it and opening things up for follow-up attacks. One thing that\u2019s a little disappointing, however, is that there are some weapons, like the Dual Blades, that don\u2019t make use of these systems at all. This has happened in previous games, namely Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, but with weapon switching being as easy as it is here, it\u2019s not as much of a let-down to have your favorite weapon left out of some of the new combat updates.\nIt\u2019s clear that Monster Hunter Wilds is a bold step forward for the series, one that\u2019ll likely draw in even more players than the gargantuan Monster Hunter World. Of course, it\u2019ll take some time for the game to settle, and for the true meta to emerge among the community. With post-launch support (you can read what's planned for the next few months in our Monster Hunter Wilds roadmap article), Capcom is in prime position to make this a truly remarkable multiplayer experience, and with new monsters like Mizutsune already announced for later this year, we\u2019re expecting big things from Wilds moving forward.\nShould I play Monster Hunter Wilds?\nPlay it if\u2026\nYou want to jump into the Monster Hunter series for the first time\nMonster Hunter Wilds is the most accessible, most user-friendly game in the series yet. It still has some incredibly obtuse systems, but the campaign acts as a great tutorial to cover the main systems and combat options. By allowing you to switch between two weapons, it\u2019s also easier than ever to get to grips with the game\u2019s diverse array of swords, axes, and bowguns.\nYou\u2019re looking for hundreds of hours of multiplayer fun\nWhile the campaign for Monster Hunter Wilds can be beaten in around 20 hours, the endgame content offers up so much more, with hunts that are great to jump into with friends. If you\u2019re looking for a new multiplayer game to get into, this is one that\u2019s likely going to be supported for a long time to come.\nDon\u2019t play it if\u2026\nYou\u2019re an old-school Monster Hunter purist\nMonster Hunter Wilds is a continuation of what World set out to do, and that\u2019s to open up the series to more players by streamlining more complicated systems. By doing this, it\u2019s a very different game to that of the older entries in the series. The combat is excellent, and the monsters are diverse, but if you\u2019re expecting the depth of something like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, you won\u2019t find it here.\nAccessibility\nMonster Hunter Wilds offers some accessibility options, namely in button mapping and colorblindness assistance (Trichromatic, Protanope, Deuteranope, Tritanope), but its convoluted control schemes could be tricky for some. Though the series has definitely streamlined its approach to combos for certain weapons, you\u2019re still going to be managing a bunch of quick menus, weapon gauges, and aiming reticles at once. A simplified control scheme would be a welcome addition, especially for more complicated weapons like the Insect Glaive, which require multiple buttons to be pressed and held at once to execute moves. There are some basic auditory settings, motion sickness reduction, and an arachnophobia mode as well.\nHow I reviewed Monster Hunter Wilds\nI played Monster Hunter Wilds for 30 hours on the PlayStation 5 Pro. During that time I completed the campaign (in around 18 hours) and then cleared through the start of the post-game content. In general, I tried to tackle side quests as they appeared and set out into each new region to explore for a while after they unlocked. There were three graphics options available during the pre-release period: Prioritize Resolution, Balanced, and Prioritize Framerate. I played the vast majority of the game in the Prioritize Framerate mode, keeping it at a solid 60fps.\nOn PS5 Pro, I played the game using a 4K Samsung TV (Samsung 43-inch RU7400 Dynamic). I used a PS5 DualSense Edge controller, with the Razer Blackshark V2 gaming headset connected via the controller port. My time with the game has confirmed that it really does earn its place on our best PS5 Pro games list too.\nHaving started with Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate on Nintendo Switch, I\u2019ve poured hundreds of hours into Monster Hunter since. Monster Hunter Rise is where I spent the most time, and I absolutely consider it to be one of the best Switch games, but recently I\u2019ve gone back to Monster Hunter World to prep for the release of Wilds.

Fleeting Bubbles has now arrived, and will run through until July 22.\nA Challenge Quest where you use specific equipment to race the clock! Participate to earn an exclusive pendant. In past games, this has meant having to try out different weapons, with only a few usable during the quest. As such, it's a good idea to get some experience with a wider variety of weapons, maybe give the Hunting Horn a go?\n- Fleeting Bubbles: Mizutsune - July 8 - July 22\nYou Might Also Like...\nJake is a freelance writer who currently works regularly with TRG.

      "text": "- Monster Hunter Wilds' second free title update arrives on June 30\n- Iconic monsters Lagiacrus and Seregios will be making their grand return\n- The game will also have a collaboration event with guitar brand Fender\nThe June 26 Capcom Spotlight included a new Monster Hunter Showcase presentation, and we now know much more about the upcoming second free title update for Monster Hunter Wilds as a result.\nArriving Monday, June 30, we already knew that the flagship monster for Free Title Update 2 is to be Lagiacrus, an aquatic 'Leviathan' type monster that fights both on land and underwater. Now, Capcom has confirmed that some underwater combat sections will be built into the Lagiacrus fight. Let's just hope it's not nearly as miserable as it was in Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate.\nMonster Hunter 4 Ultimate favorite Seregios will also be making a surprise return in Monster Hunter Wilds. An incredibly nimble flying wyvern, Seregios hadn't been revealed until last night's showcase.\nAs well as these two returning monsters, Free Title Update 2 will also bring a new Arch Tempered fight, this time with Wilds' gargantuan Uth Duna. Like with Rey Dau in the first update, players can expect to earn materials for an enhanced armor set should they manage to take down this ultra challenging monster.\nLater on in the update's roadmap, on August 27, Monster Hunter Wilds is set to launch a collaboration with legendary guitar maker Fender. During the event, players can take on a quest that lets them receive a gesture that has their hunter shredding with a limited-edition Rathalos Telecaster.\nAs for miscellaneous and quality-of-life updates, Free Title Update 2 is bringing plenty of those. Chief among these is the new Layered Weapon system, which lets hunters change the appearance of their weapons to others they've unlocked - so long as they've completed that weapon's upgrade tree.\nWe can also expect a new summer-themed festival, photo mode improvements, another wave of cosmetic downloadable content (DLC) and more.

I previously worked for the UK's Official PlayStation Magazine, and now cover all things gaming at TechRadar.\nGood afternoon gamers!\nThis is the very start of my Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 coverage. If you're just tuning in, then don't worry - you haven't missed anything yet!\nWith the show set to take this evening, I'll be walking you through the build up, sharing the latest news as it happens, and a few of my own personal predictions then bringing you a steady stream of announcements once the broadcast begins.\nICYMI: the latest Nintendo Direct is underway\nIt's not technically part of Gamescom, but the timing of this latest Nintendo Direct is definitely deliberate and likely an attempt by Nintendo to squeeze in their own short presentation before attention shifts to the big Opening Night Live show.\nThe Direct is focused on the upcoming racing game Kirby Air Riders, and is our first real look at the title since its announcement back the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct earlier this year.\nThe broadcast is currently live right now, so you can tune in if you're interested in learning all about it.\nIs Hollow Knight: Silksong news on the cards?\nHollow Knight: Silksong is easily one of the most anticipated games right now. A sequel to the 2017 indie hit, fans have been waiting for more news about this upcoming instalment for more than six years.\nCould we hear more about it tonight? It's definitely likely, as presenter Geoff Keighley has been teasing something Silksong related.\nYesterday, he posted a photo of himself wearing a clown nose to his X / Twitter account, captioned \"First time? See you tomorrow for Gamescom ONL.\" It might not seem like much, but it's a reference popular meme featuring the protagonist of Hollow Knight wearing a similar clown costume.\nFirst time? \ud83e\udd21 See you tomorrow for @gamescom ONL. pic.twitter.com/59ef5sFysJAugust 18, 2025\nHe actually posted the original meme last year, alongside clarification that there would be \"no Silksong\", so this seems like an intentional call-back.\nHopefully we're in for some kind of exciting update regarding the game tonight.\nWe're in for a live music performance\nGeoff Keighley has confirmed that we will be in some music tonight.\nIt will be the first ever live performance of music from the popular RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from composers Alice Duport-Percier and Lorien Testard.\nExactly which songs will be performed is currently up in the air, but lovers of the game definitely won't want to miss this...\nShare your own thoughts or predictions\nHave any burning Opening Night Live thoughts or predictions?\nYou can send them my way by posting to X / Twitter and tagging us @techradar! Alternatively, you can email me directly using the handy email button at the top of my author page.\nWhether you have created your own bingo card, have a list of wild hopes and dreams, or just want to offer some comments on the whole Opening Night Show, I'll be sharing the very best contributions here on this page throughout the evening.\nJust remember to keep it PG, or I'll get in big trouble with my boss and we don't want that, do we?\nExpect a Lords of the Fallen 2 reveal\nIt looks like Lords of the Fallen 2 will be revealed later tonight, following a fairly transparent teaser posted by the official Lords of the Fallen X / Twitter account.\nThe image, which shows part of a character in gothic armor, features the word \"tonight\" with the letter \"i\" replaced by the Roman numeral for two.\nThe knightmare looms\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZR1KNE9wa1August 19, 2025\nI was a fan of the latest Lords of the Fallen game, which released back in 2023. In fact, I did a expansive cover feature with a multiple-page preview of the title back when I worked on the UK's PlayStation Magazine, so it's a series that's pretty close to my heart\nDespite the name, Lords of the Fallen 2 would actually be the third Lords of the Fallen game. That's because of 2014's Lords of the Fallen, which is not to be confused with its 2023 successor.\nOur agents on the ground have arrived\nI might be stuck behind a computer screen this year, but that doesn't mean that we don't have some agents on the ground right now.\nMy colleagues Rhys and Rob reached Cologne, Germany, this morning and are currently scouting things out and attending a few early appointments ahead of Opening Night Live.\nThey tell me it's quite quiet over there at the moment, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm expecting all of that to change as the show nears.\nThere will be a ZZZ car at Gamescom 2025\nThis is a bit of a weird one, but I have received confirmation that there will be at least one automobile present in the halls at Gamescom 2025.\nIt's a special version of the Aston Martin Vantage coupe, with custom artwork based on the Victoria Housekeeping Co. faction from Zenless Zone Zero.\nIt will be showed off at the game's booth in Hall 6, booth C-031, where visitors will be able to bask in all of its glory. Those going to the booth will also be able to complete check-in missions, and win prizes including a special 1:18 scale model of the Aston Martin car.\nYou can find full details on the competition via the X / Twitter post below.\nAston Martin \u00d7 Zenless Zone Zero Collab: Gamescom Event AnnouncementDear Proxies, complete missions at the event site to receive exclusive collab merch! You'll also have a chance to win a limited edition 1:18 scale model car of the 2024 Aston Martin Vantage!#zzzero\u2026 pic.twitter.com/6JsKf8qBh7August 18, 2025\nLast year Hoyoverse had a huge booth in the public area, and I expect Gamescom 2025 to be no different.\nThe brand's presence at the trade show also suggests that there will be some interesting announcements during the Opening Night Live show, potentially new seasonal content for games Zenless Zone Zero or Genshin Impact.\nWe're going to learn all things Black Ops 7\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be getting an expansive trailer as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025. The follow-up to the successful Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, this next entry takes the series back to a futuristic setting for the first time in years.\nIt's set in 2035 and will feature a co-op campaign set right after the events of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. As usual, you can expect expect a wealth of multiplayer modes and a separate zombies mode too.\nThe game was first revealed back in the June Xbox Games Showcase, with a trippy cinematic trailer that showed off its dark tone and plenty of futuristic technology.\nWe also know that Black Ops 2 protagonist David Mason will be returning. Leaks also indicate that fan-favorite villain Raul Menendez will play an import role in the plot, which is set to take place across both Japan and Avalon - a fictional European city featured in Black Ops 6.\nThe game is set to release on November 14, 2025, so it's about time we learned more about it.\nWe've finally got some Hollow Knight: Silksong news!\nThis is not a drill - we finally have some official news about Hollow Knight: Silksong!\nDeveloper Team Cherry will be hosting a 'Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement' in just under 48 hours time.\nWhat will this 'special announcement' be? It's too early to say, but I think that it's almost certainly going to be a release date of some kind.\nBloomberg reporter Jason Schreier is claiming that there won't be a Silksong release date tonight, but I wouldn't be surprised if we still see a trailer.\nNot feeling the hype? Check out this sizzle reel\nYou can catch a Gamescom Opening Night Live sizzle reel over on the official Game Awards YouTube channel, potentially giving us some insight into what's in store.\nIt features loads of titles, with some of the most significant being Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Ghost of Yotei, and Resident Evil Requiem. I also spotted some Silent Hill f in there, not to mention a clip from the Fallout TV show.\nJust under three hours to go...\nWe're now just under three hours away from the start of the Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show!\nThat's plenty of time to get anything done that you might want out of the way before the action begins. You're going to want to make sure that you have a clear schedule, as this year's show is shaping up to be massive.\nQueues are starting to form\nGeoff Keighley has posted an update from the Opening Night Live 2025 venue, showing plenty of eager gamers waiting to get in to the show.\nFans have been lining up all day to get into @gamescom ONL tonight -- see you all soon!! pic.twitter.com/RCrwRXajDDAugust 19, 2025\nTickets are currently sold-out, so I'm expecting the hall to be absolutely packed tonight.\nDon't forget about the pre-show!\nThe main Gamescom Opening Night Live stream might be the biggest attraction, but that doesn't mean that you should forget about the pre-show.\nSet to start 30 minutes before the main event, Keighley has already confirmed that it will \"have multiple new game announcements\".\nThey're generally smaller titles than the ones that that are featured in the main event, but if you have an interest in indies you might see something that you really like the look of.\nYou'll be able to watch it via the regular Opening Night Live stream too, so it's the perfect thing to have on in the background before the event begins in full.\nThe cutest gaming hardware of Gamescom?\nRemember those early appointments that I mentioned? My colleague Rob has just been to see ASUS and spotted some absolutely adorable PC hardware.\nIt comes as part of the Asus x Hatsune Miku collection, with special TUF gaming gear based on the design of the iconic virtual singer. All of it looks incredible, and I'd love to have it as part of my PC setup.\nI most like the look of the special edition TUF Gaming H1 Gen 2 headset, not to mention the TUF Gaming Mini Wireless Mouse and TUF Gaming K3 Gen 2 keyboard. Of course, the matching TUF Gaming P1 mouse pad is an essential too.\nCould this be the cutest gaming hardware that we will see over Gamescom? It's a definite possibility.\nWe'll be getting new info on the Fallout TV show\nWe already know that we will be seeing more of the Fallout TV show tonight in a first look at its second season.\nI was a big fan of the original season, which is an Amazon Prime Video exclusive. The storytelling isn't the best around, but it's still an impressively faithful adaptation of the games' world. It's got plenty of action and a surprising amount of gore, but also the franchise's trademark comedic elements to balance it all out.\nI'm hoping that we will see some other Fallout reveals tonight on top of the show, ideally a remaster or remake of one of the older games. With the second season on the way, it would be the perfect time to revisit Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas.\nPlayable Silksong has been sighted!\nFull #SilkSong Nintendo Booth @ Gamescom pic.twitter.com/xMdlIQpfwpAugust 19, 2025\nHere's some big news for anyone waiting for Hollow Knight: Silksong out there.\nThe game will apparently be available to play at a large Gamescom booth in a demo that seems to be running on Nintnedo Switch 2 systems.\nThe information comes from a streamer, who has posted some interesting videos that they claim were taken from inside the halls at Gamescom.\nThe demo stations currently appear to be password protected though, so I don't think we're going to see any real gameplay until the event is fully open.\nJust one hour to go...\nHere's an important time reminder for you!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show is now exactly one hour away with the pre-show set to begin in just 30 minutes.\nGrab some snacks and get comfy, because it will be here before you know it...\nOur on-site team are starting to head to the venue\nI've just received an update from our crew on the ground, who are now busy making their way over to the Opening Night Live venue.\nI'll be able to give you some updates on what the atmosphere is like over there once they arrive!\nThe first Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 images are here!\nThe Xbox store page for Black Ops 7 has been updated ahead of the show, giving us our first look at some in-game screenshots!\nWe see plenty of robots, as you might expect given the futuristic setting, and what are likely some launch multiplayer maps. There are also some soldiers wearing very Black Ops 2 inspired body armor, plus a glimpse of the Zombies crew.\nYou can see them all for yourself here.\nWe've arrived!\nOur team has arrived at Gamescom 2025!\nHere's the current situation outside the convention center. It's not super busy, but we already know from Keighley's posts that lots of people are waiting indoors for Opening Night Live 2025 to begin.\nLook at that lovely clear sky though. I'm a little jealous...\nThe pre-show has officially begun\nHold on to something! The Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 pre-show has officially begun. Now is the time to get the stream open in your browser window (or tune in above), as the announcements start right now.\nThe pre-show is usually home to smaller indie games, with the bigger reveals saved for the main event. That doesn't mean that it isn't worth watching though, as you might see something that you really like the look of.\nFresh photos from the show\nMy team on the ground has been feeding me a steady stream of photos from inside the hall, where the atmosphere looks electric.\nYou can browse some of them above, including a beautiful selfie from both Rob and Rhys. Look how happy they are!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show has started!\nIt's happening folks!\nThe Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 show has now started.\nThe man, the myth, the legend Geoff Keighley is on stage right now, so expect the announcements to start coming thick and fast.\nOf course, I'll be here to keep you up to date with everything as it happens.\nHere's a look at Keighley's outfit for the night - not too shabby. Not sure about the tan shoes, though...\nHe's currently welcoming the audience to the show and has said that \"E3 didn't die, it just moved right here to Germany.\"\nHe has now moved on to the usual talk about the industry, reflecting on the success of indie games Peak and Date Everything...\nWe've now moved onto Hollow Knight: Silksong, which Keighley promises will launch this year! There's some gameplay on screen too!\nWas that it? That was about ten seconds of Silksong action. Hopefully the upcoming Team Cherry stream will shed a lot more light on the game.\nWe're starting with Black Ops 7!\nIt looks like we're going to kick things off properly with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7!\nThe trailer seems to be really focusing on the campaign, showing some absolutely bonkers looking visuals with scenes of twisting skyscrapers and all kinds of strangeness.\nWe're also getting a look at what I assume is the central cast of characters, which makes sense given the apparent co-op focus.\nAnd a quick look at multiplayer too it seems and zombies! Now the developers are on stage to outline some of the themes of the game and explore its 2035 setting.\nOh! Now some more details on the co-op campaign. It will be playable with up to four players, or solo if you prefer.\nIt seems that missions will be quite open this time around, which is reminding me a little too much of the incredibly lacklustre open-world levels in Modern Warfare 3.\nEver wondered if Keighley is reading an auto-cue? Our team on the ground can now officially confirm... yes!\nLords of the Fallen 2 revealed!\nNo we're on to the first proper game reveal of the show!\nIt's Lords of the Fallen 2, in a flashy cinematic trailer that showcases some impressive looking visuals. It's got the same style as its predecessor, but is set 100 years after the previous game.\nKeighley described it as both \"bloodier\" and \"faster\", which is promising! It's set to come out in 2026\nHere's an unexpected reveal!\nAn anime based on Sekiro Shadows Die Twice called Sekiro No Defeat has been unveiled. It will be available on the Crunchyroll streaming service.\nA new Lego Batman game is coming\nA new Lego game has been shown off, and it looks stunning! Lego Batman Legacy of the Dark Knight.\nIt seems to have a massive open world, plus some Arkham series inspired combat. It'll be here in 2026.\nA developer is on stage to tell us that Lego Legacy of the Dark Knight demo will be available on the show floor.\nThe game will track the entire of Bruce Wayne's journey it seems, with plenty of iconic moments and \"deep cut references\".\nAs with previous Lego games, I'm expecting a wide roster of playable characters taken from across the Batman universe.\nOn to the next game, a \"long awaited sequel\" that fans have been eager to see...\nNo, it's not Bloodborne 2.\nIt's a new Warhammer strategy game! Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4!\nIt will be out in 2026!\nSome Monster Hunter Wilds news now! A Final Fantasy 14 collaboration, plus a new Title Update that introduces a new monster.\nBoth are coming in \"late September\" - whatever that means.\nRy\u014dz\u014d Tsujimoto and Naoki Yoshida (or Yoshi-P) from Capcom have taken to the stage to discuss the crossover!\nThis upcoming crossover apparently came about after the success of a similar Final Fantasy crossover in Monster Hunter World.\nOur resident Final Fantasy 14-head Rhys, who is currently sat watching the show in Cologne, is very happy with this news it seems.\nWe've just seen some screenshots of the event in Final Fantasy 14, with a new mount and what looks like a Monster Hunter Wilds quest.\nThat is coming later this year in October.\nWhat the heck is this? Some kind of horror game, I thought it was Resident Evil at first but now I'm not sure if it's another Capcom title or not.\nTurns out it's not a game! It's a trailer for... Gamescom?\nSome Onimusha: Way of the Sword action now!\nIt looks like a lot of fun, with some meaty combat and creepy, undead enemies in an ancient Japanese setting.\nSome kind of anime game now? I think we might be back.\nWe're seeing loads of interesting visuals, it looks like it'll be some kind of factory management game? With some combat thrown in there too.\nHow unique!\nIt's Arknights: Endfield!

There's a demo available today, if you're interested in trying out a cool-looking mech game.\nA little first-person shooter game now, called Voidbreaker. It's out now!\nWe have actors on stage!\nI repeat, actors on stage. Some of the cast of the Fallout TV show are here, to discuss the upcoming season.

It's World of Tanks 2.0 - the \"biggest update in the game's history\".\nTime for some John Carpenter's Toxic Commando action in an extended gameplay trailer. It's got co-op, it's got shooting, and it's sure got some weird mutant enemies.\nThe game is set to release in \"early 2026\".\nTime for something a bit different, a game called Death by Scrolling.\nIt's a roguelike set in purgatory, with cute pixel graphics.

This is my kind of thing.\nIt's called Fate Trigger and will be playable in early 2026.\nAn online game based on the The Seven Deadly Sins anime now!

It's sequel extravaganza!\nThe latter also got a release date at long long last: 21 October 2025.\nAn Enshrouded expansion now - Enshrouded Wake of the Water set to come out in October. Good news for fans of the survival game, not such good news if, like me, you had never heard of it.\nAge of Empires 4 is coming to PS5! Complete with an all-new expansion.\nPre-order now, ahead of a November 4, 2025 release.\nNow here's something more up my street! A Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 expansion: Legacy of the Forge.\nWe've got some Cult of the Lamb news up! Is this going to be a free update, a sequel, or a new expansion? Let's see...\nThat's a \"massive paid expansion\" according to some on-screen text - that answers my question!\nIt's called Woolhaven and will be here in early 2026.\nWorld of Warcraft time!\nIt's time for a cinematic look at World of Warcraft: Midnight, the MMO's 11th expansion!\nThese cinematics are generally really high quality, so I'm looking forward to this.\nThere's been a noticeable lack of Resident Evil Requiem so far.

That's pretty cool.\nOkay, it's Resident Evil time...\nThe trailer is all about protagonist Grace Ashcroft and has confirmed that her mother Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak is going to be in the game!\nIt looks like we're seeing the hotel where parts of the game are set, presumably some time before her mother's death.\nWell, that guy is very dead.\nIt's almost over, with just one last surprise to go! A \"global announcement\" of some kind?\nA Game Science release! That's the Black Myth: Wukong developers. I suspect we're about to see another soulslike...\nWe've got two guys with comedy British accents on screen, plus a massive tiger. What could this be?\nIt's Black Myth: Zhong Kui! It'll be another single-player action RPG based on another part of Chinese mythology.\nIt's over!\nWhat did you think of the show?\nI thought it was pretty underwhelming, if I'm being honest."
