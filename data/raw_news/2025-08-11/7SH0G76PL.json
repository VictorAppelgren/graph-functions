  "title": "From hardware to software, Huawei pushes Ascend AI GPUs into the open-source arena, challenging two decades of Nvidia dominance in AI computing ecosystems",
  "description": "Huawei\u2019s CANN will need time and resources to take on Nvidia\u2019s CUDA",
  "content": "\u2022 CUDA\u2019s near 20-year dominance has locked developers into Nvidia\u2019s hardware ecosystem exclusively\n\u2022 CANN provides multi-layer programming interfaces for AI applications on Huawei\u2019s Ascend AI GPUs\n\nHuawei has announced plans to make its CANN software toolkit for Ascend AI GPUs open source, a move aimed squarely at challenging Nvidia\u2019s long-standing CUDA dominance.\n\nCUDA, often described as a closed-off \u201cmoat\u201d or \u201cswamp,\u201d has been viewed as a barrier for developers seeking cross-platform compatibility by some for years.\n\nIts tight integration with Nvidia hardware has locked developers into a single vendor ecosystem for nearly two decades, with all efforts to bring CUDA functionality to other GPU architectures through translation layers blocked by the company.\n\nCANN, short for Compute Architecture for Neural Networks, is Huawei\u2019s heterogeneous computing framework designed to help developers create AI applications for its Ascend AI GPUs.\n\nThe architecture offers multiple programming layers, giving developers options for building both high-level and performance-intensive applications.\n\nIn many ways, it is Huawei\u2019s equivalent to CUDA, but the decision to open its source code signals an intent to grow an alternative ecosystem without the restrictions of a proprietary model.\n\nHuawei has reportedly already begun discussions with major Chinese AI players, universities, research institutions, and business partners about contributing to an open-sourced Ascend development community.\n\nThis outreach could help accelerate the creation of optimized tools, libraries, and AI frameworks for Huawei\u2019s GPUs, potentially making them more attractive to developers who currently rely on Nvidia hardware.\n\nHuawei\u2019s AI hardware performance has been improving steadily, with claims that certain Ascend chips can outperform Nvidia processors under specific conditions.\n\nReports such as CloudMatrix 384\u2019s benchmark results against Nvidia running DeepSeek R1 suggest that Huawei\u2019s performance trajectory is closing the gap.\n\nHowever, raw performance alone will not guarantee developer migration without equivalent software stability and support.\n\nWhile open-sourcing CANN could be exciting for developers, its ecosystem is in its early stages and may not be anything close to CUDA, which has been refined for nearly 20 years.\n\nEven with open-source status, adoption may depend on how well CANN supports existing AI frameworks, particularly for emerging workloads in large language models (LLM) and AI writer tools.\n\nHuawei\u2019s decision could have broader implications beyond developer convenience, as open-sourcing CANN aligns with China\u2019s broader push for technological self-sufficiency in AI computing, reducing dependence on Western chipmakers.\n\nIn the current environment, where U.S. restrictions target Huawei\u2019s hardware exports, building a robust domestic software stack for AI tools becomes as critical as improving chip performance.\n\nIf Huawei can successfully foster a vibrant open-source community around CANN, it could present the first serious alternative to CUDA in years.\n\nStill, the challenge lies not just in code availability, but in building trust, documentation, and compatibility at the scale Nvidia has achieved.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 We've rounded up the best portable monitors available now\n\u2022 Take a look at our guide to the best authenticator app\n\u2022 Time to ditch the pen and paper - Modus now boasts e-paper with 75Hz refresh, enough to challenge even a tablet",

      "text": "OpenAI looking beyond Nvidia's expensive GPUs as it starts to use Google's TPU AI silicon - but will it be as easy as swapping chips?\nChatGPT maker wants to cut inference costs at scale\n- OpenAI adds Google TPUs to reduce dependence on Nvidia GPUs\n- TPU adoption highlights OpenAI\u2019s push to diversify compute options\n- Google Cloud wins OpenAI as customer despite competitive dynamics\nOpenAI has reportedly begun using Google\u2019s tensor processing units (TPUs) to power ChatGPT and other products.\nA report from Reuters, which cites a source familiar with the move, notes this is OpenAI\u2019s first major shift away from Nvidia hardware, which has so far formed the backbone of OpenAI\u2019s compute stack.\nGoogle is leasing TPUs through its cloud platform, adding OpenAI to a growing list of external customers which includes Apple, Anthropic, and Safe Superintelligence.\nNot abandoning Nvidia\nWhile the chips being rented are not Google\u2019s most advanced TPU models, the agreement reflects OpenAI\u2019s efforts to lower inference costs and diversify beyond both Nvidia and Microsoft Azure.\nThe decision comes as inference workloads grow alongside ChatGPT usage, now serving over 100 million active users daily.\nThat demand represents a substantial share of OpenAI\u2019s estimated $40 billion annual compute budget.\nGoogle's v6e \u201cTrillium\u201d TPUs are built for steady-state inference and offer high throughput with lower operational costs compared to top-end GPUs.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nAlthough Google declined to comment and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters, the arrangement suggests a deepening of infrastructure options.\nOpenAI continues to rely on Microsoft-backed Azure for most of its deployment (Microsoft is the company\u2019s biggest investor by some way), but supply issues and pricing pressures around GPUs have exposed the risks of depending on a single vendor.\nBringing Google into the mix not only improves OpenAI\u2019s ability to scale compute, it also aligns with a broader industry trend toward mixing hardware sources for flexibility and pricing leverage.\nThere\u2019s no suggestion that OpenAI is considering abandoning Nvidia altogether, but incorporating Google's TPUs adds more control over cost and availability.\nThe extent to which OpenAI can integrate this hardware into its stack remains to be seen, especially given the software ecosystem's long-standing reliance on CUDA and Nvidia tooling.\nYou might also like\nWayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

      "text": "Best open source software of 2025\nFree software for everyone\nWe list the best open source software, to make it simple and easy to do everyday tasks without having to pay for software licenses.\nOpen source software is any kind of program that anyone in the world can download, modify and distribute it without paying fees. It comes in a variety of flavors, from open source CRMs to cloud storage. This is because the developer has specifically chosen to release the source code for free under an open source license.\nSince the open source movement took off as a software development philosophy at the end of the 1990s, it\u2019s changed the world. Estimates even suggest that a mind-blowing 96% of all web servers globally are running on some form of open source Linux operating system, for example.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that open source doesn\u2019t just mean \u201cfree\u201d. Lots of companies release their software for free but maintain full copyright ownership of their code, so other developers aren\u2019t able to modify it. By contrast, successful open source initiatives are built on the hard work of potentially thousands of collaborators who have voluntarily given up their time to create something awesome.\nSuch an accessible development system has some serious advantages. Open source software is often more secure because people from around the world scrutinize new releases and bugs get reported and addressed fast. Also, people are motivated to add cool new features to open source platforms which means open source software is often just as good, if not better, than competing pay-to-use programs.\nWhile open source software is used in everything from networks to web servers, here we'll focus on the best open source software for you to download and run on your desktop or laptop.\nWe've also featured the best laptop for programming.\nThe best open source software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest open source software: Best office suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWith support for documents, spreadsheets, databases, presentations, diagrams, and mathematical formulae, LibreOffice is essentially a free version of the world\u2019s most popular office productivity suite, Microsoft 365.\nSome would actually argue that LibreOffice is the more fully-featured of the two, thanks to its dedicated developer community which is adding new tools and tricks all the time. For example, in the latest update, LibreOffice added a QR code generator tool so you can quickly create mobile-friendly links.\nAn alternative well-known open source office tool is Open Office, which offers many similar features to LibreOffice. The reason that LibreOffice has taken the top spot today is that it is much better at preserving Microsoft file formats. In other words, your formatting won\u2019t get screwed up if you need to modify a document originally written in Microsoft Word.\nThe only downside to this awesome free office software is that editing documents collaboratively online is a bit tricky. Recently, an online editing option has been added but it still requires some technical know-how to implement.\nRead our full LibreOffice review.\nBest open source software: Best media player\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nVLC (or VideoLAN Client) media player is a lightweight application created by an open source development group known as the VideoLAN project. This video and media player has been leading the industry for years in terms of popularity, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. You can use VLC media player to open audio and video files in just about any format without having to hunt down extra codecs.\nVLC also works for streaming media such as podcasts and online radio stations. But perhaps the greatest VLC media player feature is playback control. You can change almost everything about how your media is displayed from hardware optimization to adding subtitle files from third-party sources.\nLike some of the other amazing open source offerings mentioned here, VLC is constantly being upgraded with new goodies and features to explore. The latest updates to the free video player have included the ability to stream to other devices (like Chromecasts) and 360-degree video support for VR headsets.\nRead our full VLC Media Player review.\nBest open source software: Best image editor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBeloved by Linux users since its original release in 1996, GIMP is one of the most famous and best-maintained open source software tools out there. This software is about as close to image editing power and flexibility of the Adobe Photoshop platform as you\u2019re likely to get for free.\nGIMP has built-in support for layers, filters, and automatic photo enhancement. It also makes it easy to create new graphic design elements and you can really take things to the next level by downloading plug-ins created by the broader GIMP open source community.\nJust like Photoshop, GIMP has a fairly steep learning curve but anyone who puts in a bit of time is sure to appreciate its customizable interface and GPU hardware acceleration. However, if you\u2019re looking for a simple free photo editor, check out Paint.NET instead. It\u2019s not as powerful, but easier to get to grips with.\nRead our full GIMP review.\nBest open source software: Best video editor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nShotcut is open source free video editing software. It\u2019s one of those open source programs that really demonstrates how much a dedicated development community can improve a platform given time. In earlier versions, the Shotcut interface was a little bare, but later releases have added extra dockable panels, an intuitive timeline, and other touches that put Shotcut in the same league as premium video editors like Adobe Premiere Pro.\nThis video tool supports non-destructive audio and video editing, meaning you can compile effects without any quality loss. You can also use this platform to do color keying and grading operations, as well as more basic clip splicing and trimming.\nPerhaps the coolest thing about Shotcut is its ability to work with more or less any format of video, audio, or photo media. That\u2019s largely thanks to FFmpeg, an open source video framework that sits under the hood of the Shotcut program.\nRead our full Shotcut review.\nBest open source software: Best audio editor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEven two decades after its original launch date, Audacity remains one of the most widely-used open source applications. It\u2019s a free audio editor that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.\nAfter installing this nifty little package, you\u2019ll find everything you need to record, edit, and enhance sound files. What\u2019s more, thanks to the enormous developer community supporting the program, you can use Audacity\u2019s library of third-party extensions to add any features that aren\u2019t included by default. These will allow you to do everything from adding sound effects to auto-tuning your tracks.\nThe Audacity interface might look a little complex at first, but given the professional-grade tools available through the program, it\u2019s easy to see why this is the go-to application for musicians and podcast creators.\nRead our full Audacity review.\nBest open source software: Best FTP client\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFileZilla is a free file transfer protocol (FTP) client that allows you to manage server file systems remotely. If you own your own website, you\u2019ll already know that doing FTP operations through a web client can be a frustrating experience, and FileZilla provides a far more consistent and pleasant FTP experience than you can get with the default FTP applications that most web hosts offer.\nThis open source FTP tool comes with all sorts of advanced features such as support for large file transfers, synchronized directory browsing, and filename filters. In case you have any trouble getting through to your website\u2019s server, a network configuration wizard is also included.\nThe FileZilla interface might look a little confusing to first time users, but it\u2019s actually very simple to use. In the left-hand panel, you\u2019ll find a window displaying your local file system. Meanwhile, on the right, you\u2019ll see the file system of your server. To move a file from one to the other, simply drag and drop it.\nRead our full FileZilla review.\nBest open source software: Best email client\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you\u2019ve used Microsoft Outlook before, you\u2019ll know all about the benefits of being able to check multiple email inboxes in one place. That\u2019s exactly what Mozilla Thunderbird allows you to do, but with an open source twist. Thunderbird is an email client developed by Mozilla, which you\u2019ve likely heard of thanks to its other famous project, Firefox.\nThunderbird comes with plenty of cool tricks to help you deal with your email more efficiently. You can, for example, link emailed event updates with an inbuilt calendar or check the news with an RSS reader. If you need to send a contact a huge file, Thunderbird will even let you do by uploading it to a separate server and dropping a link into your message.\nRead our full Thunderbird review.\nBest open source software: Best password manager\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAlthough it didn't make it as one of our best password manager recommendations, KeePass Password Safe is still worthy of note here thanks to its simple set up and comprehensive feature set. It uses industry-standard (and near unbreakable) AES encryption and two-factor authentication to keep the details of your accounts safe and secure.\nKeePass also deserves a mention on this run-down of the best open source platforms due to its portability. Although this open source program can be installed on Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices, you can also store your database and the program on a USB stick for safekeeping.\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, an extensive selection of plug-ins is available for KeePass. You can use these to sync KeePass credential data automatically with your cloud storage service of choice or your browser.\nRead our full KeePass review.\nBest open source software: Best cloud storage\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInternxt is a cloud storage service that focuses on privacy and security, and like everything else on this list, it\u2019s open source. Internxt is available for all major desktop and mobile platforms, and there is a free plan with up to 10GB of storage.\nSince it\u2019s available on multiple platforms, the service has automatic syncing which makes sure that all of your information is up to date and saved no matter what device you\u2019re using.\nUsers can also access their files offline.\nGetting started with Internxt is fast and easy, and when you do, you\u2019re greeted with a very intuitive and clean interface on all platforms, as the service is very user-friendly. You can easily view your files and customize your folders with various options. Uploading files is done via drag and drop and you can share your files through a link. All the files uploaded are instantly encrypted on your device.\nChat support is quite responsive and if you wish to contact the support team, you can do so via email 24/7.\nThe company has several pricing plans for personal users, while business users will have to contact the company for more information. There are three personal plans - 20GB for $1.49 a month, 200GB for $4.99 a month, and 2TB for $10.99 a month.\nRead our full Internxt review\nBest open source software: Best browser\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBuilt on top of Google\u2019s open source Chromium project, Brave is a web browser that\u2019s designed to keep your browsing activity private by automatically disabling website trackers and blocking pesky ads. For even more secure browsing, it has a built-in Tor function.\nThe big advantage of using Brave is that you can access many of the Google Chrome store\u2019s thousands of extensions but enjoy a faster browsing experience than you\u2019d get with a normal Chrome browser. That\u2019s because Brave is less of a resource hog than Google\u2019s regular Chrome package, giving it a performance boost when loading pages.\nAnother interesting thing about the Brave browser is something called Brave Rewards. The idea behind this feature is that you can opt in to see certain ads and receive a small Basic Attention Token crypto coin in return. Eventually, the developers behind Brave hope this will change the way advertising works on the internet.\nRead our full Brave browser review.\nBest open source software: Best OS\n11 Linux\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nObviously this list couldn\u2019t be wrapped up without mentioning the most iconic open source software around, Linux. First released in 1991, Linux has since morphed into a huge family of different OS distros including desktop variants like Chrome OS (which you'd find on a Chromebook) and Ubuntu, and server stack solutions like LAMP.\nBack in the day, Linux was only run by a handful of coders due to the difficulty of installation and the amount of tweaking Linux systems required to run. However, in recent years, the developers behind the best known Linux distros have made a conscious effort to turn them into more user-friendly packages. It\u2019s now easier than ever to run a virtual Linux machine or re-partition your hard drive to add Linux as an extra OS.\nSeveral big-name computer manufacturers have even started selling Linux laptops directly to the public. That\u2019s probably, in part, because Linux uses completely different base code from more popular Windows and Os X systems, making it less of a target for hackers and bad actors online.\nBack in the day, users would often be put off Linux because few software manufacturers developed for the system. Fortunately, cloud applications don\u2019t care what kind of local system you\u2019re running, and as these get more popular there\u2019s less reason than ever not to give Linux a go.\nRead our guide to the best Linux distros.\nWe've also featured the best small business apps.\nBest open source software FAQs\nWhich open source software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which open source software to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as some platforms may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a different platform is much more worthwhile. There are many different open source software options out there, some better than others, but ultimately your choice will be based on whether the open source platform delivers on the tools you actually need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require.\nHow we tested the best open source software\nTo test for the best open source software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each open source software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best Authenticator App for 2025: Features and Security Reviewed and Compared\nAdd an extra layer of online security with the best authenticator app\nAuthenticator apps are security tools that enhance the security of your online accounts. They work by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of verification beyond just a username and password. Since passwords alone can be easily stolen, guessed, or leaked in data breaches, authenticator apps help ensure that even if someone has your login credentials, they still can\u2019t access your account without a second form of authentication.\nAuthenticator apps typically work by generating time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), which are unique codes that refresh every 30 seconds. When you log in to an account protected by 2FA, you'll be prompted to enter the current code displayed in your authenticator app. Because the code changes constantly and is tied to your device, it\u2019s virtually impossible for a hacker to guess. In some cases, authenticator apps can also send push notifications that you simply approve to confirm your identity.\nMany authenticator apps go a step further by offering biometric verification, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to open the app or to approve a login request. This adds another layer of protection, ensuring that even if someone has access to your device, they still can\u2019t bypass authentication without your physical presence. Overall, authenticator apps provide a simple yet powerful way to safeguard your digital identity and reduce the risk of account takeovers.\nOur security experts have been testing and evaluating authenticator apps for years, looking at how each one verifies your identity, its compatibility across devices and platforms, adherence to security and compliance standards, overall usability, and the range of additional security features it offers.\nWe've also listed the best security keys and the best password managers.\nReader Offer: Save 61% on NordPass for Business\nNordPass provides an easy-to-use and highly secure solution that most businesses will love, according to Techradar editors. Plans start at less than $1.79 per user per month - plus get 3 months extra.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best authenticator apps of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest authenticator app overall\n1. Authenticator App by 2Stable\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Authenticator App by 2Stable delivers a robust suite of features for users who value both privacy and convenience.\nOne area where the app excels is in secure cloud sync, which works through iCloud. This helps sync your 2FA codes across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even your Apple Watch. For users embedded in the Apple ecosystem, this significantly enhances the user experience. It also includes biometric authentication features adding yet another layer of protection.\nWe also like the app\u2019s backup and restore functionality that stores 2FA tokens in an encrypted format, which helps reduce the risk of being locked out if you change or lose your device.\nOther thoughtful touches include Apple Watch support, widgets for quick access, multiple import options, the ability to use the app without creating an account, and a lot more.\nThe app\u2019s biggest limitation is that it isn\u2019t available on Android devices, though the developers claim this is in the works. The $50 annual price tag could be another hindrance for many, though the app offers a feature-restricted free version that can manage two accounts.\nAll things considered, 2Stable\u2019s Authenticator app is best suited for users who view security and convenience as equally important, and don\u2019t mind paying a premium for both.\nBest authenticator app for security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeveloped by the makers of NordVPN, NordPass Authenticator benefits from the company\u2019s established reputation in digital security. That said, NordPass Authenticator isn\u2019t a general-purpose authenticator app. Instead the app is built for companies that already rely on NordPass Business for their password management needs.\nUsing NordPass Authenticator saves NordPass Business users the effort to copy codes from a separate app, as it allows all your employees to generate and use TOTP codes directly within the NordPass Business vault. This simplifies the login process for enterprise users and reduces friction in daily workflows.\nAlso, because it\u2019s part of the NordPass Business infrastructure, admins can enforce policies around 2FA usage, monitor access logs, and maintain visibility into how 2FA is being used within your organization. That level of control simply doesn\u2019t exist in standalone authenticator apps.\nOn the downside though, NordPass Authenticator lacks the robust backup and recovery features found in other authenticator apps. There\u2019s no option for cloud backups, like you get with 2Stable\u2019s authenticator app, nor the ability to restore your tokens on a new device. In the same vein, it also lacks any ability to sync tokens across multiple devices.\nNordPass Authenticator is bundled along with the NordPass Business product, plans for which start from $1.99/user/month when paid for a year, or $1.79/user/month when subscribed for two years.\nBest cross-platform authenticator app\n3. Authy\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAuthy is a popular 2FA app that\u2019s developed by Twilio. The app stands out for its ease of use and advanced features despite being available for free, and has a clean, responsive, and easy to navigate user interface.\nNot only does Authy support both Android and iOS, it also doesn\u2019t restrict you to a single device. Thanks to its multi-device sync you can access your 2FA tokens across your smartphones, and tablets.\nAlso, unlike many other apps in the genre, Authy offers more than just basic 2FA functionality. One of its most popular features is the encrypted cloud backup system. This helps you access your 2FA token even if you lose or replace your phone. You can also lock Authy behind a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition, which adds an extra layer of protection.\nYet, despite its strong feature set, Authy isn't without drawbacks. For starters, your Authy account is tied to your phone number. This makes you vulnerable to SIM swap attacks and also means you\u2019re sharing personal information with Twilio.\nAlso, once you\u2019ve set up 2FA tokens in Authy, moving them to another app isn't straightforward as there\u2019s no mechanism to export your data. So, if you ever want to switch to another authenticator, you\u2019ll have to laboriously first disable 2FA on each of your online accounts and then re-enable it using the new authenticator app.\nBest authenticator app for ease of use\n4. Google Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMany folks have a love/hate relationship with Google and if you're in the latter category, you probably want to move on to the next option on this list. For everyone else, say hello to the easiest and most basic authenticator app on the planet.\nGoogle Authenticator has been around for over a decade, is free, and will work with virtually every service that supports TOTPs. The app is as streamlined as it gets. There are no bloated menus, and you don\u2019t need to set up an account to use the app.\nFor a long time that was the extent of Google Authenticator\u2019s capabilities. But the app has received significant updates in 2025. The biggest news for Google Authenticator users is the introduction of cloud syncing. You can now backup your codes to your Google account and sync it across all your devices, whether they're Android phones, iPhones, or iPads, as long as they are logged into the same Google account. The app now also has a Privacy Screen feature, which helps protect access with your device's screen lock, PIN, or fingerprint, and facial recognition.\nDespite the improvements, there are a few areas where it lags behind some of its peers. For instance, while there is a search facility to find specific accounts, you don\u2019t get any organization features that you get with some other apps like Authy. Also, Google Authenticator remains a mobile-only app, and while it does work on iOS devices as well, unlike Duo Mobile, it can only backup and sync to a Google account.\nBest authenticator app for enterprise\n5. Duo Mobile\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeveloped by Cisco, Duo Mobile is best known for its use in corporate environments. Duo Mobile does more than just generate time-based TOTPs. It's built to work as part of a broader identity and access management system, but many of its core features make it a solid 2FA app even for personal use, especially since it\u2019s available for free.\nDuo Mobile works on Apple and Android phones, and tablets, as well as on smart watches. The app has a straightforward interface that makes it easy to manage multiple accounts.\nOne of the standout features of Duo Mobile is push-based approval. Instead of typing in a 6-digit code, supported services can send you a push notification on your phone when trying to log in. Simply tap \"Approve\" and you're in. It\u2019s fast, intuitive, and eliminates the need to manually input codes.\nThat said, the app also supports standard TOTP codes, so you can still use Duo Mobile to generate codes just like you would with other authenticator apps. The app also supports account recovery through secure cloud backups, via iCloud on iOS and Google Drive on Android.\nBut while you can back up and restore accounts, you can\u2019t actively sync the codes between devices like you can with Authy or 2Stable\u2019s Authenticator app. Similarly, Duo Mobile is a mobile-only app. So if you're looking to access your 2FA tokens from a computer or browser, you'll need to look elsewhere.\nBest authenticator app for LastPass users\n6. LastPass Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLastPass Authenticator is a good enough 2FA app, but it works best as an add-on for LastPass password manager users, rather than as a top-tier general-purpose authenticator on its own.\nThe app has a clean, user-friendly interface, and the process to add, remove, and view tokens is pretty straightforward. Like most 2FA apps, LastPass Authenticator works with virtually any online service that supports TOTPs. The app also scores for supporting fingerprint, and PIN protections, which helps keep your tokens secure if someone gets access to your unlocked phone.\nThat said, while it works as a general 2FA app, many of its interesting features are tied to your LastPass account.\nFor instance, unlike some of its peers, like Authy, which allows real-time sync across multiple devices, LastPass Authenticator only backs up and restores tokens through your LastPass account.\nIt also supports push notification for login approval, but again only when paired with the LastPass password manager. While it works on both Android and iOS, the app is strictly mobile-only, and doesn\u2019t have a desktop or browser extension.\nAll things considered, while LastPass Authenticator is functional as a standalone 2FA app, it doesn\u2019t offer much for non-LastPass users.\nBest authenticator app for Microsoft users\n7. Microsoft Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMicrosoft Authenticator is a good authenticator app, but it's primarily designed with Microsoft account users in mind. The app is available for both Android and iOS, works with any service that supports 2FA, and is fairly intuitive to use. It also offers a search function to sort through your 2FA accounts, which is helpful if you\u2019ve enabled it for several services.\nThe app also by default locks itself behind the device\u2019s biometric and PIN to add an extra layer of protection if someone gets access to your phone.\nAnd that\u2019s the extent of its non-Microsoft account linked features. The app offers an encrypted cloud backup of your 2FA tokens, but this is linked to your Microsoft Account, or iCloud for iOS users.\nAlso, if you use Microsoft services, you\u2019ll benefit from push-based logins that you can approve with a tap. Like many of its peers, Microsoft Authenticator too is a mobile-only app.\nFor a long time, Microsoft Authenticator has offered password autofill and even some basic password management functions. However, as of August 2025, these features are being deprecated to make the app a streamlined authenticator app, which further limits its appeal to non-Microsoft account users.\nBest authenticator app for Apple users\n8. Step Two\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStep Two is a good authenticator app that\u2019s designed specifically for the Apple ecosystem. While it\u2019s not the most feature-rich authenticator out there, it offers a clean, distraction-free interface that works well across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. If you regularly use multiple Apple devices, Step Two ensures your codes are available on all of them without any manual setup.\nTokens are automatically and securely synced via iCloud. This means your 2FA tokens are always backed up and restored across devices tied to your Apple ID cutting out the risk of losing access to them if you upgrade your phone.\nYou can use the app for free to manage up to 10 accounts/services. For a one-time purchase of $10, you can use Step Two to handle any number of accounts.\nThe biggest drawback of the app is that it is made exclusively for Apple platforms. This means that if you ever switch to Android, there's no way for you to transfer your tokens from Step Two.\nThe app also falls short of 2Stable\u2019s authenticator app in terms of features. For starters, it only supports the Safari browser, unlike 2Stable\u2019s that supports all the best web browsers.\nAuthenticator app FAQs\nHow to choose the best authenticator apps\nWhen deciding which authenticator app to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free and budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your authenticator app.\nHow do authenticator apps work?\nWithout fail, one of the easiest ways to begin using 2FA is by using your smartphone's camera and scanning a QR code provided by the company or website. Once you do, the authentication app gets to work by issuing an ever-changing unique code. That code is valid as the second form of identification for just a few seconds before the authentication app refreshes it.\nYou only have to scan the QR code once on a device. If you're using sync and backup (like many of the apps below), you probably won't have to scan a QR code during setup on another device. Otherwise, you will.\nThe codes are generated using a standard HMAC-Based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). However, at no time does the IETF gain access to the codes.\nIs 2FA all the protection we need?\nWhen 2FA options first arrived, many thought online vulnerability would finally end in the tech world. But, unfortunately, that isn't the case. 2FA, like every other form of online security, isn't 100% secure. Try as they might, a hacker or two will figure out a way to gain access to something they shouldn't. In January 2022, for example, Crypto.com was attacked. Nearly 500 accounts were compromised, and the thieves made off with more than $31 million in cryptocurrencies.\nDespite its imperfections, 2FA still provides better protection than passwords alone.\nHow we tested the best authenticator apps\nTo test for the best authenticator apps we first set up an account with the relevant platform. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each authenticator app to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best portable monitor of 2025: Perfect picks for presentations, business travel, and remote work\nWe tested out the top portable monitors for work, play, and streaming\nAfter testing and reviewing the best portable monitors, I've hand-picked the best of the best for every use - from business travel and remote work to streaming movies and playing games.\nMy top pick overall is the Arzopa Z1RC, which delivers an impressive 2.5K resolution on a 16in display at a great price. Having tested this one out, we found picture quality was excellent and colors remained vibrant.\nSome other top recommendations here include the professional Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2, and for those on a budget, both the KYY K3 and the AOC 16T3EA offer plenty to like for the price. And while almost all are suitable for Apple laptops, I still think the best portable monitor for MacBook Pro laptops and Macs is the stunning espressoDisplay, which just looks the part in the Apple ecosystem.\nEvery model featured in this round-up has been extensively tested, and we've assessed screen size, image quality, color accuracy, and connectivity.\nUpdate: In my latest update, I've cleaned up the Also Tested section with some honorable (and not so honorable) mentions.

A display like the Z1RC might not have every bell and whistle, but like most of the company\u2019s line-up, it\u2019s affordable and suitable for most uses, like working, streaming, presenting, and light gaming.\nThe IPS panel on the Z1RC features 2560 x 1600 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, two USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port. Dimensions run to 356 x 240 x 9mm, weighing 763g. Color coverage is fair, and we recorded 100% sRGB, 89% AdobeRGB, 95% P3, and 69% of Rec 2020. We did find the viewing angle to be somewhat narrow at 85 degrees. Nor is it the brightest portable screen we\u2019ve tested. Despite claims of 500nits peak brightness, it\u2019s arguably closer to 400, with our own tests showing the backlight hit around 337nits with a contrast of 1060:1. We also felt a protective case is a necessity if you plan to use this portable monitor for travel.\nOverall, there may be better portable monitors out there, but not at this price. Top lternatives we like include the gaming-focused Arzopa Z1FC and the 15.6in Arzopa S1 Table.\nRead our full Arzopa Z1RC review\nThe best cheap portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap portable monitor: The real stand-out feature of this display is the price, which is around $100 / \u00a3100 - and we\u2019ve seen it discounted to around $70 on Amazon, too.\n\u2705 You want a lightweight screen: We really like how light and portable this display is, even at 15.6in, weighing in at around 1.70lb / 770g.\n\u274c You\u2019re a creator: One of the weakest parts here is the color gamut, which is very low compared to other displays we\u2019ve tested. Definitely not one for accurate content creation.\n\u274c You\u2019ve got a bigger budget: For a few bucks more, there are better options out there that won\u2019t see you compromising on color reproduction and, in some cases, even boost resolutions.\nThe KYY K3 may not be the best portable monitor in the world, but for the extremely low price, it delivers everything we\u2019d expect from a cheap, lightweight display - and a few features we didn\u2019t expect. The handful of flaws we found can be pretty much overlooked considering the cost.\nDesign is nice - nothing ground-breaking, but simple and practical, and very easy to use. Power button, menu select wheel, and an audio jack can be found on the left. There\u2019s even a set of built-in speakers, although as you\u2019d expect from a budget device, audio quality is tinny. Port selection is fine. Along the right-hand side, you\u2019ll find two USB-C and a mini HDMI input, making it pretty straightforward to connect a laptop, mobile device, or games console. You\u2019ll also get a range of cable adapters for more connectivity.\nWhat we really liked is the inclusion of a full OSD menu, letting you tweak the likes of color temperature, contrast levels, and Eco modes - not every portable monitor has this, so to see it on a low-cost display is a nice touch. Speaking of color, though, the gamut here is pretty woeful. We measured 64% sRGB and 49% for both AdobeRGB and P3, which rules this out for use by creative professionals. Still, for a sub-$100 portable monitor that comes with power supply, cables, and case that doubles as a stand, and with a 1080p resolution, this little screen ticks a lot of boxes.\nRead our full KYY K3 review\nThe best portable monitor for business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want excellent resolution: With a resolution of 1440p (or 2.2K), this portable screen offers a bit more than the standard 1080p you\u2019ll find on most displays of this size.\n\u2705 You want real portability: We\u2019ve long been championing 14in as the perfect size for a business laptop, and the M14t Gen 2 fits nicely in that niche, too - big enough to see, small enough to travel.\n\u274c You need true color coverage: 100% sRGB isn\u2019t bad for a portable display, but it won\u2019t suit professional photographers and designers.\n\u274c You need a budget portable display: It may be cheaper than the Gen 1 was, but the Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 is still about $400 / \u00a3400 new.\nPart of Lenovo\u2019s Think series, the M14t Gen 2 is a 14in touchscreen portable business monitor that\u2019s overall optimal for working, watching, and low-level photo and video editing.\nWe\u2019ve used plenty of ThinkPads in our time, and while the laptops\u2019 keyboard and build quality are outstanding, the screens never stood out against the likes of Apple MacBook Pro. So, how does the ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 measure up?\nThis iteration boasts 1440p resolution, 16:10 aspect ratio, 100% sRGB color gamut, and 1500:1 contrast ratio. At $400 / \u00a3400, it\u2019s around a hundred bucks cheaper than the Gen 1 was on release (as an older model, it\u2019s decidedly cheaper now). So, in every way, it addresses the issues we had with the otherwise perfectly acceptable predecessor.\nImage quality is excellent, and we had no issues editing videos and photos, or watching YouTube videos. Text was crisp, colors were accurate, vibrant, blacks were deep. Using the touchscreen and included stylus was simple and snappy - although it\u2019s not going to be your go-to drawing tablet. Nor will it meet serious gaming needs due to high input latency. If that\u2019s not an issue, the Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 is one of the best portable computer monitors you can get.\nRead our full Lenovo ThinkVision M14t Gen 2 review\nThe best portable monitor for Mac & MacBook Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an attractive portable display: We love the slick, professional design of the espressoDisplay, which neatly fits Apple\u2019s eye-catching aesthetic.\n\u2705 You want a portable laptop monitor to boost productivity: One of the reasons we love the espressoDisplay is the boost to productivity we found from this slim, minimalist screen.\n\u274c You need a simple travel monitor for a laptop: This portable display is, like an Apple device, a bit of a statement piece as much as it is a productivity tool.\n\u274c You need a cheap portable laptop monitor: The premium build and design of this display is reflected in the price.\nThe espressoDisplay 15 is our pick for best portable for Mac,MacBook Pro, and Mac mini devices. True, most displays here are compatible with Apple devices, but the espressoDisplay\u2019s sleek design fits well with the Mac aesthetic - and it showed outstanding performance when we hooked it up to our MacBook Pro 16in. With two USB-C inputs, though, you\u2019ll find it works well with most Windows laptops, too.\nAttached to the magnetic stand, you can smoothly switch from landscape to portrait mode quickly - an essential feature for photographers and designers. There\u2019s also a Creator screen protector, adding a matte finish to the glass screen, which we found made it easier to view in direct sunlight, and write on using the espresso stylus.\nUsing the screen for everything from work communications to review writing and photo editing, the portable display never missed a beat. It felt a natural fit for a more productive and efficient working environment. We\u2019re not saying we got obsessed with the espressoDisplay, but we did find multiple reasons during the review period to work from home, just to have an excuse to use it. We also like the option of choosing a 13- or 15-in version depending on how portable you need it to be.\nRead our full espressoDisplay 15 review\nThe best portable monitor for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to play games: With a future-proof 240Hz refresh rate, this Asus portable screen is geared towards gamers.\n\u2705 You want a large portable monitor with built-in battery: The Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE boasts a 7,800 mAh battery built in, lasting up to four hours at 240Hz on a single charge.\n\u274c You want to watch or work: If you\u2019ll mostly be watching YouTube and Netflix, or using office apps, this monitor is probably overkill.\n\u274c You need a cheap portable monitor: As you\u2019d expect with specs like this, the portable monitor isn\u2019t as cheap as the sub-$100 displays you\u2019ll find on Amazon.\nA 17.3in full HD display with a 240Hz refresh rate gives the Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE the edge. The best portable gaming monitor we\u2019ve tried, this device is focused, offers no compromises, suitable for the most dedicated players.\nEven with its broad screen, the device is just 0.4in thin, weighing around 1kg, with a USB-C and miniHDMI ports along the side. In our hands, the well-built ROG Strix XG17AHPE showed no signs of bend or flex. It comes packages with a case and compact tripod, which is a thoughtful touch.\nIn use, the large portable display is vivid, crisp. When we tried games like Overwatch, Valorant, and Call of Duty, colors were popping off the screen without oversaturation, remaining distinct even in darker areas of the game. And we loved the smoothness that came with a higher refresh rate, with no ghosting and blur. Audio is loud and clear, too.\nYes, it\u2019s a bit overkill if you\u2019re presenting or Netflix-ing the night away (although it\u2019s perfectly capable of doing it). Also, while current-gen consoles are only capable of 120Hz, the refresh rate here offers in-built future-proofing, and the Switch and PlayStation still felt smooth during our gameplay tests.\nRead our full Asus ROG Strix XG17AHPE review\nThe best cheap portable monitor alternative\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a standard FHD display that won\u2019t break the bank: The AOC 16T3EA is a solid all-rounder that delivers what most need from a portable monitor at a reasonable price.\n\u2705 You want a lightweight, slimline screen for on the go work: In our tests, we found the AOC 16T3EA felt particularly good for business use.\n\u274c You need high-resolution and high color coverage: It\u2019s only 1080p, has a low 250cd/m\u00b2 brightness, and scrapes by on 56% sRGB, 41% Adobe RGB, and 41% DCI-P3 - so, this is not a display for content creators.\n\u274c You need a portable monitor for gaming: With only 60Hz refresh rate, this will be fine for single-player games on the go, but won\u2019t meet demands for high-speed multiplayer gaming.\nThe AOC 16T3EA may have some minor limitations, notably the color accuracy, it\u2019s well-priced for a portable full HD display.\nWith its 15.6in 1080p IPS display and a slim, lightweight design, we found it a very effective multi-tasking companion for on-the-go professionals. We were impressed by the 14mm profile and 870g weight, even with two built-in kick-stands tucked away around the back for portrait and landscape orientation. Helping to maintain that compact form is the inclusion of a single USB-C connection. Just plug it into any compatible Windows or Mac laptop and you\u2019re away.\nAnd this may be the first deal-breaker. There are no other ports along the display. Not even an audio jack. We also noted the disappointing brightness (just 250cd/m\u00b2), while color coverage is effectively non-existent (56% sRGB, 41% Adobe RGB, and 41% DCI-P3). And the lack of anything beyond OSD controls means we can\u2019t recommend this for content creators and photographers. But for anyone looking for a smartly designed portable second-screen, there\u2019s a lot to like.\nRead our full AOC 16T3EA review\nThe best big-screen portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a big screen: At 27in, this is one of the largest portable monitors we\u2019ve reviewed, offering plenty of screen real estate for work, collaboration, or presenting.\n\u2705 You want high resolutions: Most traditional portable displays hover around the 1080p mark, which is fine for smaller screens, but this one boasts 2.5K QHD resolution.\n\u274c You want actual portability: Yes, it\u2019s slim and fairly lightweight, but this isn\u2019t a monitor you\u2019ll want to cart around with you regularly.\n\u274c You just want a standard portable monitor: With these specs, the screen is likely overpowered if all you want to do is hook up a second screen to your laptop.\nDespite its 27in QHD IPS panel, the Asus ZenScreen MB27ACF is surprisingly slim and relatively lightweight. For me, this is ideal for a single-station set-up or use across an office where you need to key into the details or collaborate with others. I wouldn\u2019t like to be carrying this on the commute everyday, especially since it doesn\u2019t come with a case or sleeve for protection.\nThe screen is clear, with a matte anti-glare covering but no touchscreen capabilities. Specs-wise, you\u2019re looking at 2.5K resolution, 1500:1 contrast ratio, 300 nits brightness (so about average), and 99% sRGB. That feels about right, but I would've loved to see a wider color gamut so creators could benefit from the large-screen portability, too. It does have built-in speakers along the bottom. They sound nice enough, although I\u2019d still recommend external speakers or headphones for almost any portable monitor.\nAround the back is a fold-out kick-stand, which I initially found a little stiff but otherwise works well (for security, I\u2019d advise using both hands on either side of the stand to pull it into position). You can effectively set this up anywhere. Better still, Asus also supplies a monitor arm and hooks for hanging the monitor in the box. There\u2019s no battery built in, so you\u2019ll need to run it off the mains. Port selection is standard - HDMI, USB-C with DP Alt Mode, and an audio jack. It also features a 70W USB-C power delivery, too. Right now, this is a solid pick for anyone who needs a large-sized portable monitor, particularly for business-use.\nRead our full Asus ZenScreen MB27ACF review\nThe best OLED portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want OLED brightness: The standout feature of this portable computer monitor is the OLED screen that really makes colors pop.\n\u2705 You want a portable screen for on-the-go color work: While not ideal for everyone, a decent color space coverage makes this a fair choice for those working with colors.\n\u274c You don\u2019t need OLED: Not everyone using a portable monitor will need this sort of screen, which adds a fair amount to the price-tag and may be overkill for many uses.\n\u274c You need exact pantones: Color coverage is fair, but it's not precise, and the lack of high resolutions may make this unsuited for professional designers.\nThe Innocn 15A1F is one of the best portable monitors around - light, compact, a well-sized 15.6in screen at 1080p, it covers most bases. It\u2019s not the only portable OLED display out there, but it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re looking for a crisp, bright screen at a relatively affordable price.\nAlong the device you\u2019ll find two USB-C ports (one for 45W power) and a HDMI 1.4 port. This means you can easily connect it straight to a laptop or games console. However, the 60Hz refresh rate will have limited appeal to serious gamers. Using it on a Windows computer, the desktop appeared remarkably punchy, boasting inky blacks and highly saturated colours. Our only real complaint is the reflective nature of the glossy glass screen.\n400nits is the stated brightness for this panel. In our tests, it hit 406.2nits at 100% brightness setting. Impressive, but not bright enough for true HDR output. Base color coverage runs to 100% sRBG, 98.3% Adobe RGB, and 100% DCI-P3 - so, if you don\u2019t mind the limited screen size, there\u2019s potential here if you\u2019re a designer or working with color.\nRead our full Innocn 15A1F review\nThe best portable monitor for creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a creator: The real star of the show here is the color accuracy and color gamuts, which make it ideal for all types of content creator on the go.\n\u2705 You want an OLED panel: The OLED feature here make it another good pick for those who want a bright (but not too bright) panel for easy viewing even in direct sunlight.\n\u274c You want a higher resolution: While the specs are popping off almost across the board, you might expect higher than 1080p resolution - not that you need 4K with a screen this size.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: The excellent performance and build quality for this device does come at a cost.\nIf you're a content creator or creative professional who needs a portable monitor while working across multiple locations, the ViewSonic VP16 OLED is a top pick. What really caught our eye during review is the wide color gamut and overall accuracy.\nThis display boasts DCI-P3, sRGB, REC.709, and DICOM color modes that impressed us during review. it's also really easy to switch between them all using the on-screen display or the buttons located at the foot of the screen. There's Pantone validation and DisplayHDR 400 certification here, too, and ViewSonic guarantee average Delta E of less than two - in our tests, we measured it at just 0.5.\nSo, what didn't we like? Our biggest issue is that it's not a 10-bit display but 8-bit plus FRC. Resolution sits at just 1080p, which may be a deal-breaker for some. However, under review, text, photos, and videos all looked sharp, so don't let that put you off. On paper, it's pretty average brightness, too, but although we measured brightness at 402cd/m2, it's difficult to imagine anyone having problems using this even in direct sunlight. And, as usual with even some of the best portable monitors, the speakers aren't great.\nBut that's not why you'd buy a display like this - it's for the excellent color accuracy. And on that score, it's difficult to find fault.\nRead our full ViewSonic VP16 OLED review\nThe best laptop screen extender\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a triple-screen set-up: With two portable screens sitting either side of your laptop screen, the Maxfree S6 is a great productivity tool.\n\u2705 You use it at one or two locations: We found this a great addition to our home office workspace, but as a dual-screen device, it\u2019s undeniably heavy and not great for travel.\n\u274c You need a budget screen extender: Laptop screen extenders are already more expensive than a standalone display, and the Maxfree S6 is at the upper end of the scale. For a budget alternative, look to a brand like Arzopa and AOC.\n\u274c Your laptop is not between 13in and 17in: The S6 fits 13-17in laptops, so if you're running a netbook or an especially large display, it won\u2019t be suitable.\nThe Maxfree S6 is a dual-portable monitor with two 15.6in screens that unfold, sitting either side of your Windows or Mac laptop. Best for business use and multi-tasking, it\u2019s really easy to set up, with a standard-issue 15.6in IPS panel featuring 1920 x 1080 resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, and 60Hz refresh rate. A fairly low 1000:1 contrast ratio and 300cd/m\u00b2 brightness, and a very low 72% NTSC colour gamut round out this portable screen.\nWhat really sets this unit apart from other triple-monitor units is the flexibility over positioning the two screens. Each one is independent of the other, letting you place either in portrait or landscape orientation, using just one or both. Each monitor will also require its own power supply, so make sure your laptop has enough ports or you\u2019re using a USB hub.\nIdeal for use in the office or home office, given its size and weight (360.7 x 216.6 x 45mm / 2.3kg), it\u2019s certainly portable - but it\u2019s undeniably bulky, and we found using the supplied case a necessity over cramming it into a laptop bag. For a smaller, more portable option, check out our The Portable Monitor Flex 14-inch review. It's also not the cheapest laptop screen extender we\u2019ve seen out there. For low-cost alternatives, we recommend looking at models from brands like Arzopa and AOC.\nRead our full Maxfree S6 Triple Laptop Screen Extender review\nThe best small portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a tiny travel-friendly display: At just 13.3in, the CrowVi is ideal for those who want a small, lightweight portable display for travel.\n\u2705 You want a touchscreen device: Not all portable monitors we try have touchscreen, but it's a welcome addition to this small and simple unit.\n\u274c You need a bright, high-resolution screen: While we enjoyed our time with the CrowVi, it's not the brightest you can find.\n\u274c You need the thinnest portable monitor you can: It may boast a small screen, but this is certainly not the thinnest portable display we've tested.\nThe CrowVi portable monitor from Elecrow has all the bells and whistles of a modern screen while being simple and small. The glossy 13.3in FHD IPS panel is bright at 300 nits and offers an 800:1 contrast level. Being thin at less than 10mm and weighing around 350 grams, the monitor can easily be moved around. The IPS technology also provides a great viewing angle and faithful color reproduction. The supplied plastic cover doubles as a stand while protecting the screen.\nWe found the display worked right out of the box, providing superb image quality and a touch interface. The low power consumption and built-in speaker make it an essential accessory for crowded spaces like desktops. Its best feature is that it works with only one Type-C connection, providing power, display, and touch input.\nOur biggest issue using the CrowVi is its glossy screen, which can distract from serious work. The bezel isn\u2019t the smallest found on a portable display, and while using only a slide button for the menu might be economical, this renders navigating the settings time-consuming. But, perhaps, that's the trade-off for a cheap portable monitor that's on the small side compared to most. See our Read our full CrowView Note review for a larger alternative from the same makers.\nRead our full CrowVi review\nThe best dual-screen portable monitor\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want two screens with higher than usual resolution: Both of these 16in screens have a resolution of 2.5K, ideal for\n\u2705 You're a creator: There are two factors that make this model stand out to me - 100% sRGB color gamut and a touchscreen with pen support.\n\u274c You need a highly portable monitor: With its dual-screen set-up and 16in screens, it's a large and heavy device.\n\u274c You need a portable monitor for gaming: While we liked a lot of the specs here, the 60Hz refresh rate limits its use for gamers.\nThe Delta Pro Touch from monitor-makers Uperfect is a pretty impressive device, all told. Here, you get two 16in 2.5K monitors, each covering 100% of the sRGB color gamut, and both supporting touch interface. There's even a stylus included in the box, which makes it one of the best portable monitors for creators, photographers, and anyone editing images.\nAfter unboxing our review unit, we gave it the once over. Design-wise, it's fairly compact, but it's not one for everyday carry - better to set it up in one location, rather than carting around multiple locations in a day (although that's absolutely a possibility). The included kickstand also felt stable and was versatile in use.\nTesting this portable monitor for over two weeks, we connected it to a range of devices, including a MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, Dell Precision and ThinkPad laptops, and even set it up to display Apple TV on one screen and a Mac on the other. Throughout this time, we had no issues with performance at all. Thanks to the built-in screen rotation tool, it also served as a good presentation unit, letting others see what you see when folded over.\nPorts selection is straightforward enough but hardly generous, with just a USB-C and mini HDMI port, but there's already two screens here, so we wouldn't\nIt's not as widely available as I'd like - you can get it shipped worldwide from the Uperfect website, of course, but beyond AliExpress, I can't see many options out there for the UK, Europe, and Australia. Still, at the time of writing it's been heavily discounted on both sites, which may swing it for you.\nRead our full Uperfect Delta Pro Touch review\nBest portable monitor: Also tested\nNot every portable monitor we test can be considered the best, but each of these deserve an honorable mention.\nWe really liked this slick and slim portable monitor for its lightweight design and high-resolution screen.

Plug one end into your device, the other end into the display, and head into your operating system's display settings for further configurations like mirroring.\nSome portable monitors also connect to devices via USB-A, mini-HDMI, micro-HDMI, and VGA. Check your manual for full details.\nAre portable monitors compatible with all devices?\nYou'll find the best portable monitors are compatible with laptops, tablets and gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Depending on the portable monitor model, it may be possible to hook up to display to a desktop, but if you have the space for a second full-sized monitor, this will be usually be the better option for productivity gains.\nDo portable monitors have built-in speakers?\nSome of the best portable monitor models do feature built-in speakers. However, when it comes to internal speakers, we find audio quality varies greatly. Lower-priced portable monitors often having a shallow, tinny sound to them, lacking in bass. These speakers will be fine for presentations or in a pinch, but pale in comparison to those with dedicated audio systems or external speakers.\nDo portable monitors require external power?\nIt depends on the model. Some portable monitors feature a built-in rechargeable battery, while others will draw power from the connected device.\nBoth have pros and cons. A portable monitor with a battery means you can use it for longer on the go, but it will be heavier. They're also more expensive. A display without a battery is lighter to carry, but will drain your device faster if you're not connected to the mains.\nHow to choose the best portable monitor for you\nChoosing portable monitor hinges on your use case and to what device you are connecting.\nHardware & connections\nWhen selecting the best monitors for a dual set-up, most people pair a portable monitor with a USB-C-equipped laptop. When it comes to plug-and-play simplicity, these are usually the top option, ensuring both compatibility and plenty of bandwidth for any resolution a portable monitor is likely to offer. That said, many mobile screens also support mini-HDMI, micro-HDMI, USB-A, and VGA. Just be aware that it may require software and drivers, which could present a problem depending on your device to drive the display.\nScreen size & resolution\nScreen size is an important deciding factor - big enough to complete tasks, small enough to carry with you. Most of the best portable monitors are 15.6-inch panels with a 1080p resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels - although 4K portable monitors are becoming increasingly prevalent, with better color accuracy and color space coverage for creatives. However, 10 to 13in screens are available for true portability.\nRefresh rate & response time\nMost of the portable monitors we review have a refresh rate of 60Hz - standard for most monitors, except for the best gaming monitors. if gaming if your prime concern, and where every millisecond counts, check for a screen that refreshes the on-screen image faster. Look for 120Hz or 240Hz. Response times refer to how long it takes for a pixel on your monitor to change - the quicker, the better, especially for games.\nBattery\nBattery or no battery is another critical question. You can get portable screens both with and without built-in power. Cheap portable monitors tend to come without a battery, and are lighter. However, if you\u2019re using a mobile screen away from the mains, they will drain your laptop\u2019s battery pretty fast.\nBrightness\nBrightness is a significant factor, particularly for creative work and gaming. If you plan to use your portable display outside, you want as much of that as humanly possible. Most are limited, only topping out at a little over 200 nits. Aim for the brightest, highest luminance you can get - although brighter displays will use up even more battery when powered by your laptop. We always test the luminance of a device to see how well it holds up against the manufacturer's claims.\nBudget\nThe best portable monitors range in price, from as little as $50 up to hundreds of dollars for premium displays - so it's easy to find one that does everything you need at the right price. Don't forget to check Black Friday portable monitor deals and Prime Day portable monitor deals when the seasonal shopping sales are on.\nHow we test the best portable monitors\nWe've tested a range of professional displays, including the best monitors for video editing, the best monitors for MacBook Pro, and the best monitors for photo editing. We've also reviewed the best monitors and best business monitors. So, we know what to look out for when you need a second screen to take with you.\nAll devices featured in this round-up have been tested by us. We evaluate these displays across many aspects, starting with the design and dimensions, exploring weight and overall portability. Build quality is essential for the best portable monitors, and we're looking for robust devices that are designed for travel, the commute, and multi-location set-ups.\nFor screens, we look at size, avoiding - and noting - any signs of glossiness and reflectiveness when used in bright rooms or outdoors in sunlight. We also compare each display's resolution, and whether it's capable for the use. For example, we'd expect higher resolutions for photo editing than for streaming movies or presentations at work.\nWe also check brightness and viewing angles - and we always test the manufacturer's claims of brightness. In many cases, peak luminance in a real-world setting is lower than the stated specs, and we'll note this in our review. Where available or relevant, we'll evaluate color accuracy and color coverage to identify the screens with the best image quality.\nFor more, see our guide How we test, review and rate professional and business monitors on TechRadar Pro.\nWe also tested the best monitors for graphic design - and these are the ones we recommend\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best Large Language Models (LLMs) of 2025\nLLMs for business\nThe best Large Language Models (LLMs) make it simple and easy to set up, manage, and train your own AI models.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate natural and programming languages. LLMs can be used to help with a variety of tasks and each have their own degree of suitability and cost efficiency. For this guide we tested multiple individual models from the same foundational model where appropriate to find the best LLM.\nThis area of technology is moving particularly fast so while we endeavor to keep this guide as up to date as possible, you may want to check whether a newer model has been released and whether the cost efficiency for that model makes it a better choice.\nThese are the best LLMs of 2024 tested by us. We've picked one foundation LLM as best overall and selected individual models from a range of foundational models for each category.\nThe best LLMs of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest LLM overall\n1. OpenAI's GPT\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe majority of LLMs are based on a variation of the Transformer Architecture, a neural network architecture that was first documented in a 2017 research paper authored by 8 scientists working at Google. The Generative Pre-trained Transformer, also known as GPT, is one of several different foundational models used by tech firms to power the LLMs currently available on the market today. While there are several different types of GPT available today, the first, and arguably the most well-known, was introduced by OpenAI in 2018 as GPT-1.\nGPT models can be adapted by developers to tackle specific tasks and workloads, or used in a more general approach to cover a more broad range of applications. For example, Github Copilot uses a version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 that is specifically tuned to help programmers write code, while the EinsteinGPT model built into Salesforce cloud aims to enhance the experience of their customers by improving productivity for employees.\nIn November 2023, OpenAI announced they would enable ChatGPT subscribers to create custom GPTs using their own datasets, training data and even allow them to access database systems to pull data for analysis in real-time. OpenAI also plans to allow developers to publish and monetize their custom GPTs for other users and developers to use, so we might see some interesting releases over the next few years that build upon the core GPT models already available today.\nOpenAI is at the forefront of GPT development, releasing several different versions for public use over the last few years. While each subsequent release of OpenAI GPT has contained incremental improvements to its intelligence and capabilities, this has come at the price of reduced performance, and an increase to response latency and cost to use.\nGPT-3.5 was very quick and cost effective, but could often make mistakes or demonstrate bias, GPT-4 improved the capabilities and intelligence of the model at an increase cost to use and higher response latency. The latest release, GPT-4o, bucks the trend by being the most intelligent version yet, while reducing the cost to use and improving latency by a considerable margin.\nOut of the box, the GPT models from OpenAI provide a fantastic \u201cjack of all trades\u201d approach that is sufficient for most use cases today, while those looking for a more specialized or task specific approach can customize them to their needs. This makes GPT models a great option for those who need something that just works, without the need to train the models on their own datasets for them to become effective.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that, like with all LLMs on the market today, GPT models aren\u2019t immune to providing false, biased, or misleading responses. While the most recent releases are becoming more accurate and are less likely to generate bad responses, users should be careful when using information provided in an output and take the time to verify that it is accurate.\nBest LLM for coding\n2. GitHub Copilot\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGitHub is one of the largest and most recognisable developer platforms in use today and is used by many individuals and enterprises to store, manage and share their codebases, so it makes sense that they have also created an LLM for coding to help developers enhance the speed and efficiency of their work.\nGitHub Copilot is a coding assistant powered by the GPT-4 model from OpenAI that can be accessed via an extension within several commonly used IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Additionally, unlike other coding assistants, GitHub Copilot has an advantage over the competition by being natively integrated into GitHub.\nOriginally released in October 2021 and powered by OpenAI Codex, a modified version of the GPT-3 model, GitHub Copilot is a coding assistant that provides developers with a range of different tools that help them to understand new and existing codebases or code snippets, write blocks code quickly and efficiently, and help troubleshoot issues. It can also help write test cases for automated testing and can help inspire you with solutions to problems you encounter.\nIn November 2023, GitHub Copilot was updated to use the GPT-4 model to further improve its capabilities. With the recent release of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o model, it makes sense to speculate that GitHub Copilot could be updated to use the latest version in the future but there has been no confirmation if or when that may happen at the moment.\nOne of the most eye-catching features is GitHub Copilot\u2019s ability to use a prompt to generate code that can either be entirely new, or based on the project\u2019s existing codebase by suggesting entire blocks of code or auto-completing lines as you type them. GitHub states that the model has been trained using source code from publicly available code repositories, including public repositories on GitHub itself, and claims that GitHub Copilot can support any language that appears in a public repository.\nHowever, GitHub does mention that the quality of the suggestions GitHub Copilot can offer is dependent on the diversity and volume of the training data available for that language. This could mean that while GitHub Copilot will still try to assist developers with suggestions when working in more obscure or less used programming languages, the benefits developers may gain when using GitHub Copilot may be reduced compared languages that are more common and publicly visible.\nSubscriptions to GitHub Copilot are available today at 3 different feature levels and price points tailored to individual developers, small to large businesses, and Enterprises. If you\u2019d like to try before you buy, GitHub Copilot offers a 30 day free trial to the \u201cIndividual\u201d subscription tier.\nBest value LLM\n3. Meta LLama\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGiven Meta is included as one of the \u201cBig Five\u201d global tech firms, it should come as no surprise that they\u2019ve been working on their own LLM to support their products, large and small businesses, and other applications such as research and academics. The original version of Llama released in February 2023, but was only made available on a case by case basis to select groups within academia, governmental departments, and for research purposes. Llama 2, released in July 2023, and Llama 3, released in April 2024, are both available for general and commercial usage today.\nThe most attractive selling point for Llama 3 is how cost efficient the LLM is compared to others on the market. While it might not be quite as capable as the behemoth that is GPT-4o (though still quite comparable), it is still a very capable model that can match the performance of GPT-4 at a fraction of the cost.\nDepending on provider, Llama 3 costs an average of $0.90 per 1 million output tokens which is considerably cheaper compared to GPT-4 and GPT-4o, which sit at $30 and $15 respectively for the same quantity of tokens. This can make Llama 3 a very cost-effective solution for those who need to process a high volume of tokens and desire a high quality output, but have a limited budget.\nFrom its own internal testing, Meta has claimed that Llama 3 can also match Google Gemini and Claude 3 (though it\u2019s currently unclear how it stacks up against the recent Claude 3.5 Sonnet release) in most benchmarks, making the value proposition from Meta increasingly attractive when combined with how much it costs to use.\nIn addition to the significant cost reduction achieved, with LLaMA 3 is also open-source, allowing users to sign up to gain access to each of the different sized models, download them, and install them on their local systems or infrastructure instead of relying on cloud-based offerings from providers such as AWS or Azure.\nThis a considerable difference to many of the other popular models on the market which require you to exclusively utilize their services to make use of the models. The 8B (8 Billion parameter) version of Llama 3 is small enough that you could comfortably run it on a modern high end desktop, though you will need a large amount of RAM and GPU VRAM to make best use of it, though you do need considerably more for the larger 70B model. This essentially allows you to use the model for \u201cfree\u201d, aside from any initial hardware setup costs, which could be very useful to individuals, students and academics.\nAdditionally, those who may have concerns about privacy can avoid the potential risks commonly associated with sending data into the cloud for processing by hosting Llama 3 on local hardware, or owned infrastructure. Naturally the hardware you have available does factor into the overall performance of Llama 3 compared to using a cloud solution offered by providers such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS, but if your main goal is to keep your costs as low as possible, the performance sacrifice may be worth it.\nWhile the 8B and 70B Llama 3 models are highly capable, Meta is also working on a gigantic 400B version that Meta\u2019s Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun claims will become one of the most capable LLMs in the world once released.\nBest LLM for business\n4. Claude\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in March 2024, Claude 3 is the latest version of Anthropic\u2019s Claude LLM that further builds on the Claude 2 model released in July 2023. Claude 3 has 3 separate versions, Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus, each with a different level of capability and cost to use. Claude 3 Opus is the highest level and most capable version of Claude 3 that Anthropic claims has set new industry benchmarks across a range of cognitive tasks and has a higher capacity for reasoning that other models on the market today.\nOne of the areas in which Claude 3 excels is the size of the context window which helps to improve the context of responses based on the conversation history. While the original release of Claude was limited to a 100,000 token context window, both Claude 2 and 3 have an expanded context window of up to 200,000 tokens.\nIn real terms, this translates to roughly 500 pages of text, or approximately 150,000 words. For comparison, the standard context limit for GPT-4 is 32K tokens, and both GPT-4o and Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro are limited to 128K tokens. There are several business cases where this large input limit can provide significant gains, such as identifying trends within a large dataset, summarization of long form answers from customer satisfaction surveys, screening job applications based on a given criteria, and helping to iterate upon an idea or design being discussed with Claude 3.\nAs well as its ability to process large datasets, Anthropic claims that Claude 3 Opus, the most expensive tier of Claude 3, is the most intelligent model on the market today, and can has demonstrated some level of awareness based on the tasks given to it. During testing, Alex Albert, one of Anthropic\u2019s prompt engineers, gave Claude 3 Opus a task similar to finding a needle in a haystack by asking it to locate a specific sentence hidden inside a random collection of documents.\nNot only was the model able to find the \u201cneedle\u201d, but Claude 3 Opus also mentioned that the sentence appeared out of place and suggested that it was likely placed there for testing purposes. This demonstrated a surprising level of awareness not usually found within LLMs, although it remains to be seen as to whether this was something akin to true awareness, or if it simply follows the pattern of mimicking human intelligence as most LLMs attempt to do.\nThe creators of Claude, Anthropic, have a very strong foundation on alignment, aiming to Claude a better choice for businesses that are concerned not just about outputs that might damage their brand or company, but also society as a whole.\nHowever, all of this does come at a rather large cost compared to the competition. For those not looking for API access, Anthropic provides a free subscription tier that includes limited access to a chat interface at claude.ai powered by the newly released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, however all 3 models are accessible with higher usage limits by subscribing to the Pro tier.\nBest LLM for chatbots\n5. Qwen\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in February 2024, Qwen-1.5 is an LLM from Alibaba tailored that aims to match or outperform Google\u2019s Gemini and Meta\u2019s Llama models in both cost and capability. As well as a base models, Alibaba have also released a counterpart model tailored for chat scenarios as Qwen-1.5-chat\nSimilar to Llama, Qwen-1.5 is an open-source model that anyone can download for free and install on their own hardware and infrastructure. This makes Qwen-1.5 a very competitive choice for developers, especially those who have limited budgets, as the main costs with getting this model up and running are initial hardware investment and the cost to run and maintain the hardware.\nTo help support developers, Qwen-1.5 offers several different sizes of the model to fit a wide range of devices and hardware configurations. The largest and most capable version of Qwen-1.5 chat currently sits at 72B parameters, while the lightest version is as small as 0.5B. Qwen-1.5 has an input token limit of 32K (the 14B model is limited to 8K), which is a on par with GPT-4 and is significantly larger than the 4096 input token limit of Llama 2.\nAlthough it has the same input limit as GPT-4, Qwen-1.5 has the same output token limit as Google\u2019s Gemini at 8192, which is one of the higher output limits for LLMs on the market today. It should be noted that, like with other models on the market, the capabilities of the model decrease as the parameter size reduces, so keep that in mind when selecting the model size for your specific use case.\nIn benchmarks, Qwen-1.5 consistently outperforms Llama 2 in most scenarios, whilst also achieving competitive results compared to GPT-4. This further increases the attractiveness of Qwen-1.5 as it can offer near GPT-4 levels of capability at a fraction of the cost, and you can fine tune with a custom dataset to tailor the model to your specific usage needs. Plus, as you train the LLM on your own machine, you get to keep hold of your own data.\nIn a customer support scenario, this would provide you with a bot that is far more capable of understanding the issue a customer might have than the more traditional keyword or rule based chatbots commonly seen on the internet today. Qwen-1.5 would then be able to respond intelligently to customer queries based on your knowledgebase to improve first contact resolution rates and escalate more difficult or advanced issues to second line support agents.\nTo further enhance its chat capabilities, Qwen-1.5 can accept and respond in an impressive 35 languages and can offer translation services in over 150 others. Like with other LLMs, the number of tokens for inputs and outputs depend on the language being used as some have a higher token-to-character ratio.\nWhile recommending Qwen-1.5 for chatbots might seem like a bit of a curveball, its important to remember the use case you are applying this LLM to. In the case of a customer support bot, you probably don\u2019t need advanced intelligence allowing users to have the long philosophical conversations that you might with something like GPT-4o as its way out of scope for what you intend to use it for.\nQwen-1.5-7B-chat is available for use today via a web interface over at huggingface.co, while the larger models can be downloaded to run locally.\nBest multimodal LLM\n6. GPT-4o\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOpenAI is one of the most recognisable names when it comes to LLMs and is widely known for several models and products released over the last few years, including DALL-E for image generation, and ChatGPT, a chatbot based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\nReleased in May 2024, GPT-4o is the latest offering from OpenAI that extends the multimodal capabilities of GPT-4 Turbo by adding full integration for text, image and audio prompts, while further reducing the cost to users, making it an attractive option for those looking to for a language model that can fill multiple roles. OpenAI claims GPT-4o is twice as fast, half the cost, and has five times the rate limit compared to GPT-4 Turbo.\nOne of most significant enhancements in GPT-4o is Voice Mode, which allows the model to process audio in real time, and output a realistic, tone appropriate response in human sounding voice that might make you question if you are speaking to a real person. The human voice output is certainly impressive when compared to most of the text to speech applications currently on the market and does a fantastic job of imitating how a person might speak in real life by adding inflections and nuances normally heard in regular conversation.\nAdditionally, GPT-4o can utilise a camera to analyze the environment around you to help add context to the responses given. OpenAI demonstrated the Audio Mode and Vision features in a video alongside the release announcement for GPT-4o, however these features are not yet fully available for general usage.\nFull text integration in GPT-4o adds incremental improvements to evaluation and reasoning compared to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo and offers live translation into 50 different languages. Like with Audio Mode, GPT-4o further improves the ability to recognise context and sentiment from text inputs, and provide accurate summarizations, allowing responses to be more accurate and be presented in the appropriate tone. As with previous versions of GPT, GPT-4o can store and refer to historic conversations and look them up in real time to lend further context to responses.\nOpenAI is already rolling out the text and image features of GPT-4o to ChatGPT. In a first for OpenAI, those using the free tier of ChatGPT will have access to GPT-4o, although in a limited capacity that resets daily, which is a fantastic step given GPT-4 required a paid subscription to use when it launched. Plus subscribers users will have access to message limits up to 5 times higher than before, and an alpha version of Voice Mode will be made available to Plus users in the coming weeks.\nAPI access to the new text and image capabilities of GPT-4o is available for developers to use today, while the new audio and video capabilities will be made available in the API to a select group of partners ahead of a full rollout to the wider audience, however there\u2019s no current announcement for a specific date as to when the new voice and video capabilities will be made available.\nBest LLM for translation\n7. Google Gemini\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nReleased in February 2024, Gemini 1.5 is an updated version of the original Gemini LLM released in December 2023 that offers improved capabilities and performance compared to the original. As of May 2024, there are 2 versions of Gemini 1.5 available to subscribers \u2013 Pro and Flash.\nWhile Gemini doesn\u2019t appear to directly translate text itself, the translations provided are a combination of the translations provided by Google Translate, the multilingual training data Gemini has access to, and the LLM capabilities of Gemini, to produce a more fluent and natural sounding output.\nThis results in translations that flow better, make more contextual sense, and are less awkward than the more literal translations typically offered by Google Translate on its own, resulting in a much better overall translation. This combined approach means that Gemini 1.5 can be used to translate any language currently available via Google Translate, however the level to which Gemini 1.5 is able to enhance the output to improve how fluent and natural sounding it is does depend on the level of multilingual training data available to the model for each individual language \u2013 though this is a similar limitation that other LLMs also have.\nWhile other LLMs, such as and GPT-4o, also provide some translation capabilities, one of the key areas that Gemini 1.5 has an advantage is cost. Costs can quickly mount up if large quantities of text need to be translated, so being able to translate quickly and cheaply is an incredibly important factor. While GPT-4o has demonstrated some impressive translation capabilities of its own, also costs $15 per 1 million output tokens for text output.\nBy comparison, Gemini 1.5 costs only $2 per 1 million, which is significantly cheaper. An important thing to note when translating large quantities of text is that while Gemini 1.5 can accept up to 1 million input tokens at a time, output is currently limited to only 8192 tokens. The number of tokens required for an output will heavily depend on the target language for the translation, with some languages having higher token-to-character ratios than others.\nExceeding this limit can result in error messages, or truncation that leaves your translation incomplete. To obtain translations that require an output larger than the token limit, you\u2019ll need to break down your requests into smaller chunks. While 8192 tokens per response might seem quite low when considering it equates to around 6000 words, GPT-4o is currently limited to 2048 output tokens per response.\nGemini 1.5 Pro is free to use with some limitations, though a subscription is required for access to the increased 1m input token limit and higher rate limits.\nHow to choose the best Large Language Model\nEssentially it comes down to bang for buck. ChatGPT-4o is brilliant and can do pretty much what all the others can but at a cost. Claude 3, while not trained specifically for coding like Copilot also has a good reputation for creating code. Another thing to consider is access to your data and who owns what. You can train your own chatbot with OpenAI by creating an assistant but at the end of the day that stays with OpenAI. If you use an open model you can keep hold of your data and completely own your own trained model.\nBest Large Language Model FAQs\nWhat are Token limits?\nToken limits are a restriction LLMs have based on the number of tokens they are able to process in a single interaction. Without limits, or by having limits too large, the performance of an LLM can be affected, resulting in slow response times. However, if the limit is set too low then the LLM may struggle to generate the desired output. If an output limit is exceeded, the LLM may truncate an output, leaving it incomplete, attempt to reduce the size of the output by providing a less detailed output, or could simply generate an error. Some LLMs have the ability to segment responses to overcome output limits, but this isn\u2019t a universal feature for all LLMs.\nWhat is a rate limit?\nA rate limit is the number of requests that a user can make over a given period of time, often in minutes, hours or days. Rate limits are usually imposed by providers to help reduce the load on infrastructure so they can continue to provide an optimal service level. Rate limits are usually defined within the subscription tier for each product, with more expensive tiers offering increased rate limits.\nRate limits for your chosen LLM will vary depending on the provider, so consult their pricing sheets to determine which tier offers the best value for your needs.\nHow to use a local LLM / Open source LLM\nUnlike providers such as OpenAI and Google which use subscriptions to provide access to their LLMs, and are hosted on their own infrastructure, individuals and enterprises can download open source LLMs and deploy them to their own infrastructure.\nUsers have the option to deploy the model to existing hardware they already own, or purchase cloud compute or VPS instances to provide increased performance if greater capability is required.\nFor enterprises, this can present a cost effective way of incorporating an LLM into their business, while keeping costs lower and reducing privacy and data security concerns by keeping information in house rather than submitting it to a third party.\nWhat are tokens?\nLLMs don't break up language into individual words. Instead, they break language into chunks of text. These chunks can be individual characters or phrases of multiple words . These chunks of text are called tokens.\nWhen you use an LLM through an API you are paying for the amount of tokens used. For multimodal LLMs it's slightly different. The amount of effort to take an image as an input is converted to an amount of tokens. So, while it is not measuring tokens, you are still charged tokens.\nSo, tokens can be seen as a unit of currency exchanged for work done by an LLM and also a unit representing an amount of text. The general rule to estimate how many tokens a prompt will use is 1 token = 4 characters. For example, \u201cMay the force be with you\u201d contains 25 characters and would require ~6 tokens. However, this is only an estimate, and using inputs in other languages could require more tokens for the same input.\nYou\u2019ll need to consult the documentation of your LLM of choice to learn more about how their specific Tokenizer works.\nWhat is an LLM?\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is form of artificial intelligence trained using massive sets of data to allow the model to recognize and generate text across a wide range of tasks. LLMs are build upon machine learning concepts using a type of neural network known as a Transformer Model.\nMore advanced LLMs are also capable of accepting and outputting images, videos and audio as inputs for the model to recognize. These models are known as a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)\nHow we tested the best LLMs\nTo test for the best LLMs we first set up an account with the relevant platform, then we tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each LLM to see how useful its basic features were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced options.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Report claims Nvidia will sell a special version of its most powerful GPU to China to comply with US export restrictions, but that won't be enough\nCheaper, weaker GPUs might be China\u2019s golden ticket to massive AI infrastructure growth\n- A watered-down Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 is still potent enough to keep China\u2019s AI ambitions alive\n- Nvidia\u2019s workaround isn\u2019t top-tier, but it could still flood China\u2019s data centers\n- Export rules slow performance, but they can\u2019t stop parallelized AI scaling by Chinese CSPs\nIn response to US export restrictions introduced in April 2025, Nvidia is reportedly preparing a special edition of its RTX Pro 6000 GPU for the Chinese market.\nA report from TrendForce claims this new version will switch from high-bandwidth memory (HBM) to the slower but more accessible GDDR7.\nThe switch will allow the chip to comply with new regulations that prohibit GPUs with HBM-level memory bandwidth or advanced interconnect capabilities, resulting in a scaled-down GPU, but not one lacking power.\nNot the best, but enough for decent AI work\nThe RTX Pro 6000 is a potent chip. Even after being watered down, TrendForce estimates its performance will fall between Nvidia\u2019s older L40S and the L20 China edition. This places the chip well within the range of GPUs capable of meaningful AI workloads.\nWhat\u2019s driving interest is not just availability, but capability, even with the downgrade. Critics have pointed out that a cut-down version of a very powerful card is still extremely capable, especially if it's priced more affordably.\nAs a result, Chinese cloud service providers (CSPs) are expected to scale horizontally, buying more units and optimizing for larger node deployments.\nYes, this approach will be more expensive and consume more power, but that\u2019s just a numbers game - CSPs will need to increase infrastructure investment and manage higher power demands. The downside, of course, is that such workarounds are inherently inefficient.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nNonetheless, if the price per unit is right, the aggregate performance could still meet, or even exceed, current needs.\nIt may not be the fastest setup in traditional terms, but in parallelized environments, the performance gap could narrow. That said, Chinese chipmakers like Huawei and Cambricon are working to fill the gap left by restricted access to top-tier Nvidia GPUs.\nIf the special edition RTX Pro 6000 succeeds, it might delay the domestic adoption of homegrown alternatives. If it fails, it could accelerate them.\nNvidia\u2019s strategy may help it navigate current U.S. restrictions, but it remains an open question whether that will be enough in the long run.\nA weaker chip could still be one of the fastest GPUs on the market, and too powerful to ignore, especially when the line between compliance and capability is so finely drawn.\nYou might also like\n- These are the best AMD graphics cards on the market right now\n- Take a look at the best mini PCs you can buy today\n- Quantum computing startup wants to launch a 1000-qubit machine by 2031\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

      "text": "Huawei is making its Ascend AI GPU software toolkit open-source to better compete against CUDA\nHuawei is getting better at making AI GPUs. Now it wants to increase adoption of its technology on the software side\nHuawei has greenlit a plan to open-source its CANN software toolkit for its Ascend AI GPUs. According to the South China Morning Post, Huawei is making this move in order to better compete against Nvidia and its closed-source CUDA software ecosystem.\nOpen-sourcing CANN, or Compute Architecture for Neural Networks, could further speed up developer innovation and improve the usability of Huawei's Ascend AI GPUs. Furthermore, Huawei has reportedly already held talks with China's leading AI players, business partners, universities, and research institutions on how to build an open-sourced Ascend ecosystem.\nCANN is a heterogeneous computing architecture that provides multi-layer programming interfaces to help users build AI applications tailored to Huawei's Ascend AI GPUs. At a high level, it's Huawei's version of CUDA, which provides the same interfaces for Nvidia GPUs.\nHuawei's decision to open-source its CANN software kit could further enhance China's effort to build self-sufficiency from Western chipmakers and help incentivize developers to build software for its Ascend AI GPUs. The performance of those chips is catching up to Nvidia's Blackwell B-series GPUs in the right environment.\nNvidia is notorious for keeping its CUDA programming language a closed-off \"moat\" or \"swamp\", a trait that has been a key frustration for developers for years. CUDA is a tightly bound ecosystem that has very little support beyond Nvidia's own hardware, forcing developers to use Nvidia GPUs exclusively if they want to build software in CUDA.\nThere have been initiatives like ZLUDA that have attempted to bring CUDA functionality to other GPU vendors (through a translation layer), but they have largely been unsuccessful due to pushback by Nvidia.

So instead of repackaging PR blurbs and feature checklists, I decided to actually try them.\nThis guide is the result of hundreds of hours spent signing up, testing features, running real workflows, and figuring out which AI tools actually help get work done, across every major use case I could think of.\nI went deep into each tool, from image generation to email automation, chatbot building to scheduling assistants. TechRadar's team and I have personally tested every tool in this guide. So, let\u2019s get right into it.\nBest AI website builder tools\nWhen it comes to AI website builder tools, Hostinger is a standout. Their AI-powered suite covers various functionalities, making website creation effortless. The user-friendly Hostinger website builder, backed by AI, allows anyone to design and launch stunning websites easily. Boost productivity, save time, and achieve impressive results with Hostinger's AI tools.

He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is one of the best web hosting and website builder providers. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough. Built-in features cover everything from appointment booking and email marketing to social posts and eCommerce setup. It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI Notes Apps\n1. Jaime\n- What is it: An AI note-taker that records and summarizes meetings without using bots.\n- Ideal for: Founders, managers, sales teams, or recruiters who need instant, structured summaries of meetings\nAI note-taking tools handle tasks like reviewing meetings, creating summaries, or managing action items. Jamie does all of this automatically, so you can stay focused on the conversation.\nI tested Jamie in both virtual and in-person meetings. The clean interface kept distractions away, with no bots, popups, or glitches interrupting the experience.\nJust one click to \u201cstart meeting,\u201d and Jamie ran in the background. In under ten minutes post-call, Jamie dropped a polished transcript with key takeaways and action items, all neatly tagged by the speaker.\n\u2705 You want accurate meeting notes without bots: Jamie records privately in the background, no pop-ins or distractions.\n\u2705 You need summaries and transcripts fast: You get the full output in 10 minutes with tasks, decisions, and speakers tagged.\n\u2705 You care about privacy and compliance: Jamie is GDPR-compliant, and your data never gets used for AI training.\n\u274c You need live transcription: On the downside, Jamie only processes recordings after meetings end.\n\u274c You rely heavily on mobile: Jamie is currently desktop-only with no mobile app.\nYou\u2019ll also find a built-in assistant. Simply hit Command+J and the AI will help you draft emails, search meeting history, or brainstorm ideas.\nOn a call with a Spanish-speaking client, Jamie handled both languages without any glitches or wrong understandings. I also added terms like \u201cSDK rollout\u201d to the custom word list, and they came through clearly in the summary. It helped keep the transcription accurate, even when the discussion got more technical.\nThere\u2019s no real-time transcription or mobile app yet, and you\u2019ll need to manually share notes or copy content into tools like Slack.\nWhile there aren\u2019t any major bugs, the exporting options are limited. Even some users on G2 have reported issues with older conversations or audio sync.\nThat said, the summaries themselves are reliable, bot-free, and feel especially useful if you value privacy or want a clean, distraction-free way to keep track of meetings.\nBest bot-free AI notes app for private, accurate meeting summaries\nJamie captures meetings quietly in the background, transcribes them with high accuracy, and highlights tasks and key takeaways, without any bots or browser extensions. Its AI assistant helps with writing follow-ups, searching across meetings, or drafting ideas post-call. The free plan includes 10 meetings/month. Opt for their paid plans, which begin at \u20ac24/user/month with longer meetings, priority support, and more AI usage.\n2. Fireflies.ai\n- What is it: An AI meeting assistant that joins calls, records conversations, and turns them into searchable transcripts and summaries.\n- Ideal for: Teams that host regular meetings and want searchable records, auto-summaries, or integrations with CRM and project tools.\nTo see if it really works, I used Fireflies on a mix of team calls and one-on-ones. It handled speaker identification surprisingly well and got the meeting structure right almost every time.\nWhen the call ended, the summary showed up in my inbox. It was neatly organized by topic with time-stamped highlights.\nFireflies automatically joins your Zoom, Meet, or Teams calls, records the conversation, and transcribes it with solid accuracy. No reminders or setup needed.\nAfter the meeting, it delivers AI-generated summaries with action items, key highlights, and organized sections like \u201cPricing\u201d or \u201cNext Steps,\u201d so you can skip the note-taking and stay focused.\n\u2705 You want detailed, time-stamped meeting recaps: Fireflies breaks down calls into labeled sections with summaries, questions, and next steps.\n\u2705 You use apps like Slack, Notion, or Salesforce: Fireflies has direct integrations with over 60 tools for easy sharing.\n\u2705 You manage a global team: With support for 100+ languages and speaker ID, it\u2019s built for multilingual meetings.\n\u274c You need complete accuracy out of the box: Some AI summaries need edits if the call includes crosstalk or poor audio.\n\u274c You\u2019re only looking for mobile or in-person note capture: The mobile app exists, but it is more limited than the desktop experience.\nThe Fireflies Chrome extension is pretty useful for those who connect on Google Meet often. It adds a live transcript sidebar during your calls, so you can follow along in real time. And you don\u2019t need to invite the bot, just join the meeting, and Fireflies will capture everything from your browser.\nFireflies\u2019 AskFred made it easy for me to find what you needed. For example, when I asked \u201cWhat did Alex say about onboarding?\u201d and it pulled the exact response from the notes. This means you don\u2019t need to scroll through the whole transcript for a simple answer.\nIf your team relies on tools like Slack, Notion, or Google Docs, Fireflies\u2019 integrations are a real plus.\nYou can send notes to a shared Slack channel or clip soundbites into Notion to follow up later. Fireflies works quietly in the background, surfaces what matters, and saves you time after every call.\nBest AI notes app for teams that need transcripts, not just summaries\nFireflies turn every call into searchable notes, summaries, and insights, which is perfect for busy teams. With support for 100+ languages, smart filters, and deep integrations with CRMs and project tools, it becomes more than just a transcription tool. The free plan includes unlimited transcription and limited AI summaries. You can subscribe to its paid plans starting at $10/user/month with unlimited summaries, AI apps, and integration support.\n3. Notion AI\n- What is it: An all-in-one AI assistant built into Notion for writing, research, task planning, and workspace queries.\n- Ideal for: Notion power users, content teams, students, or managers who want AI help across notes, databases, and documents.\nPart of Notion workspace, Notion\u2019s AI helps you summarize, reformat, translate, brainstorm, and get answers from your notes without switching tools.\nI used Notion to tidy up a messy project doc, pull action items from team sync notes, and turn revision material into a toggle-style quiz guide\nUnlike regular AI notetakers, Notion is context-aware. Let\u2019s say you have a transcript from a writing workshop you attended. You can ask Notion to summarize something like \u201cThe importance of search intent while writing a blog.\u201d It doesn\u2019t just search keywords. It scans the entire page, or even your whole workspace, to understand what matters. Then it delivers a clear, relevant answer.\nYou can even narrow that search to a specific doc, database, or tagged goal using @mentions. It also pulls content from connected tools like Google Drive or Slack and adds citations when needed.\n\u2705 You already use Notion as your main workspace: Notion AI is built into the tools you\u2019re already using, from notes to docs to calendars.\n\u2705 You want an all-in-one AI assistant: It handles writing, editing, summarizing, translating, and even extracting data from other tools.\n\u2705 You need workspace-level search: Ask it to find updates, draft pages, or summarize anything across your workspace.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Notion at all: It only works inside Notion, so it won\u2019t help with external docs or tools unless integrated.\n\u274c You need a perfect structure every time: Some summaries or tables need edits to match your format or tone.\nThere\u2019s also an AI Chat that works like a workspace-wide command center. It runs on GPT\u20114 and Claude to help with prompts or planning. I asked for a 5K training schedule and got a full week-by-week plan with toggles.\nIf you're not sure where to begin, the Notion templates gallery is worth checking out. It comes with a bunch of pre-built layouts for everything from meeting notes and study planners to editorial calendars and startup CRMs. You can add a template, then ask AI to help you populate or personalize it instantly.\nSome features still need polishing. The study tools often require manual edits, and summaries may lose detail unless you specify it to keep the original phrasing.\nBest AI assistant for Notion users who want writing, search, and task help\nNotion brings AI tools like GPT-4 and Claude straight into your Notion docs, making it perfect for summarizing, brainstorming, writing, and workspace querying. It helps you clean up text, generate tasks, build custom dashboards, or auto-fill databases. A free trial is available in all accounts. If you want more, go for Notion\u2019s paid plan at $10/user/month with full feature access and integrations.\nBest AI voice generators\n1. Murf.ai\nMurfai.ai is by far one of the most popular AI voice generators.

They also offer different accents for each language, allowing users to select the one that suits their projects.\nCustomization features include adjusting the voice speed, pitch, and volume to suit your specific needs, and the option to choose between male and female voices, which can add more versatility to your projects.\nLike most of its alternatives, Murf.ai offers a pay-per-use model, which means that you only pay for the number of characters you need to convert to speech. You also get a free trial with 5,000 characters, to get you started with the software and allow you to test the service before committing to a plan. Murf.ai starts at $29/month or $19/ month if billed yearly.\n2. Play.ht\nPlay.ht is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that allows users to convert written text into realistic-sounding audio. The software offers a range of options for users, including male voices, female voices, and multiple languages.\nOne of the main advantages of Play.ht is its ease of use.

Premium plans start at $39.25/ month or $29.25/ month billed yearly\nHowever, note that the service may not be suitable for users who require highly specialized voices. If you need strong regional accents or unique speech patterns this might not be your suitable option.\nWhile the voices are generally of high quality, they may sound robotic and unnatural sometimes, especially when speaking longer pieces of text.\nPlay.ht is useful, efficient, and cost-effective for users who need to convert text to audio fast and easily, but it may not be the best choice for all users. It all comes down to your specific needs and requirements.\n3. Lovo.ai\nLovo.ai is a text-to-speech (TTS) software that provides AI-generated voices in multiple languages and accents.

ElevenLabs\nEleven Labs offers solid features to transform text into natural-sounding speech and to clone voices with great accuracy. It offers a level of realism that sets it apart from other similar tools. While getting started, you can train the AI with just a few voice samples to create personalized voices for a variety of purposes. Plus, you can even earn every time someone uses your voice on their project.\nIt excels with its Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature and offers four distinct AI speech models: Eleven Turbo v2 for low latency, Eleven English v1 with plenty of voices and styles, Eleven Multilingual v1 which supports 10 languages, and Eleven Multilingual v2 supporting 29 languages. Plus, you can choose from over 40 pre-made voices or create your own custom voices. It further helps in fine-tuning of stability, clarity, and style exaggeration simply by generation speed and output quality for optimal results.\nEleven Labs offers two levels of voice cloning. Instant Voice Cloning needs just a few minutes of audio to create a high-quality clone quickly. Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly. Alongside, their pricing structure is based on usage which makes it pretty expensive for heavy usage.\nFor instance, ElevenLabs AI has 4 premium plans i.e. Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. Under this, the cheapest plan starts at $5/mo and includes basic features and a 30,000-character output capacity whereas, the most expensive plan costs $330//mo and offers 2,000,000 character output and 660 custom voice slots . This could prove expensive for you if you want extensive voice synthesis and have a tight budget.\n2. Speechify\nSpeechify also coverts text to speech, with an extensive library of over 200 unique voices that include various genders, accents, and speaking styles. With Speechify, you can fine-tune specific elements on a word-by-word basis and make precise adjustments to pitch, speed, and tone.\nIt offers a video dubbing tool that automatically translates and dubs audio for videos from YouTube or uploaded files.

Similarly, Speechify\u2019s neat user interface and drag-and-drop functionality make editing straightforward and creating content very smooth.\nMoreover, Speechify also comes with cross-platform compatibility through which it works seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, computers, and makes it accessible for you across different devices. It also integrates well with many platforms like Notion, WordPress, and HubSpot.\n3.

Still, if you're more focused on having advanced voice customization or a wider variety of AI voices, then you might want to consider using a dedicated AI voice changer instead.\nBest AI translators\n1. Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2. Microsoft translator\nGiving cut-throat competition to Google, Microsoft also has a translation service of its own. The Microsoft Translator provides text, voice, and document translation across multiple languages. In our opinion, you\u2019ll make the most out of this translator if you prefer working on Microsoft\u2019s workspace. We say this because its integration with Microsoft products and its focus on business and enterprise use cases boost your productivity and save you a good amount of time.\nMicrosoft Translator extends to over 100 languages and offers many translation options. It further provides customizable translations through its Translator API and Speech service, both part of the Azure AI Services suite. This helps businesses to integrate translation capabilities into their applications, call centers, and multilingual conversational agents, all of which help in smooth and efficient communication with global customers.\nDuring our test, we used a feature called \"Live Transcribe\" that can transcribe speech in real time. This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4. DeepL\nDeepL is an AI-powered translation service famous for its accurate translations and careful focus on language nuances. It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

      "text": "Best AI writer of 2025\nQuickly generate text\nWe list the best AI writers, to make it simple and easy to create simple automated text content.\nThe word \"AI\" has been named the word of the year. ChatGPT has made waves since its introduction in late 2022. With every new iteration of this powerful tool, users have found innovative ways to use it to simplify and speed up their work.\nNow, there are many AI writing assistants on the market, competing with ChatGPT to become the king of AI-powered writing tools. These new tools aim to simplify the writing process by generating long-form content, researching keywords, creating images from text, and more.\nHowever, be warned that a lot of tools that market themselves as \"Ai writers\" are nothing more than scripts for auto-generating text, which means the quality is so poor you'll probably having to spend more on human writer/editors to correct it.\nAdditionally, AI-generated content may also lack the unique voice and style a human writer can provide and the content generated may require additional editing to ensure it's polished. On top of all this there is the constant danger of any information within the text being inaccurate.\nIn spite of all these concerns, some businesses think there are benefits of using AI writers, such as cost and time savings. These are usually businesses more focused on producing quantity rather than quality, and so are probably using AI writers to replace existing automated text generation scripts.\nAlso be warned that AI writers may not yet good enough to help with creative content and are still effectively autogenerating or replacing text based on set rules, which means text they create can read as artificial, and edits they make can sometimes seem senseless.\nIf you're interested in trying one of these tools, below we've listed the best AI writers on the market.\nYour AI Writing Assistant, Built-In. Draft, Refine, and Create with Gemini in Google Docs & Gmail. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nThe best AI writers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest AI writer overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You also need a grammar editor: Getting help from an AI writer is even better with one that also helps you with grammar, like Grammarly.\n\u2714\ufe0f Need to use it across multiple apps: With Grammarly installed on your computer, you instantly gain access to it across your favorite apps like Microsoft Word and other word processing packages.\n\u2714\ufe0f Want something that's easy to use \u2014 once you learn how to do it: Once you understand how GrammarlyGO works, it's going to make your life easier and assist you in making your text better.\n\u274c You're on a strict budget: No doubt, Grammarly itself is expensive, especially if you only want to pay for it on a month-to-month basis.\n\u274c You don't need a grammar tool: Maybe this is overkill, depending on your situation.\n\u274c You need social networking-specific tools: GrammarlyGO doesn't offer these types of tools, at least for now.\nGrammarly stands as a user-friendly writing companion, offering a wealth of features to enhance your content. Perfect for students, professionals, and writers.\nCheck out our in-depth Grammarly review for a closer look at the service, and see why it's our top AI writing pick.\nThe growing demand for writing tools underscores the need for efficient and reliable solutions. Enter Grammarly, a long-standing player in the market, designed to elevate written communication. It offers a suite of powerful features including grammar and spell-checking, style suggestions, tone adjustments, and clarity enhancements. We recommend the tool to anyone who is seeking an extra hand in their writing journey.\nGrammarly can be integrated into various writing platforms, including web browsers, MS Word, Google Docs, and more. In fact, this is a more popular choice as Grammarly provides real-time feedback on documents. Once integrated as an extension, you can use Grammarly to edit pretty much anything you write. But, it is worth noting that the Free version of the extension is quite limited and only provides suggestions for grammar.\nGrammarly is also available as a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices and is free to download. The Grammarly keyboard integrates with mobile apps including Outlook, Gmail, and Instagram to name a few, and allows users to access the Grammarly writing assistance on the go.\nGrammarly caters to all writing needs including grammar checking, style suggestions, and readability analysis. However, if you want to get the most out of the tool, you will have to upgrade to Premium or Business version of the tool as the Free version is quite limited and only tracks grammar errors. Overall, our experience using Grammarly was positive and we found the interface to be user-friendly plus the real-time feedback was an added bonus.\nPlease read our full GrammarlyGo review.\nBest AI writer for marketing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You are a marketer: Anyword is the best AI writer for marketers on the planet.

However, it is important to note that it is not a replacement for an experienced writer or editor. While it can provide recommendations for titles and automate SEO and WordPress publishing, it is not designed to produce ready-to-publish content.\nOne of the benefits of Articleforge is that it is available in seven languages, making it ideal for international blogs or multi-language sites. Users simply need to enter a few keywords and the topic they want to cover, and the platform will generate content in under 60 seconds. This auto-generated content will use the provided keywords and cover the desired topic.\nIn addition to its quick and easy content generation, Articleforge also offers various integrations, including MS Word and WordPress integrations. The platform also provides integrations with other software systems like SEO AutoPilot, CyberSEO, RankerX, SEnuke TNG, and more. These integrations are easy to use, thanks to the API key offered by the platform.\nWhile the platform is a convenient tool for creating content, its output quality falls short of expectations. As with any automated system, fact-checking is necessary for the majority of the content offered by the platform. The platform does offer better output quality with customized input. However, extensive testing is required, which can quickly exhaust the \"word meter.\"\nHowever, be warned that if you're hoping to be able to generate spam content to flood Google Search with then be warned that you're well over a decade too late, as Google implemented natural language analysis and processing to filter out junk into their algorithm a very long time ago.\nOverall, it is advisable to test it out and find a balance between the platform and tailored input to yield superior results. While it should not be relied upon as a sole source of content, using it in conjunction with other resources can help users quickly generate usable content.\nRead our full Articleforge AI writer review.\nBest AI writer for long-form writing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a great plagiarism checker: You want to create original content, right?

One of the most impressive features of Writesonic is its versatility - it supports over 25 languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Chinese, and more. This is a significant advantage for businesses that operate in multiple regions and need to produce content in different languages. However, as usual, ensure you have editors who are fluent in these languages to avoid embarrassing mistakes.\nAnother notable feature of Writesonic is its tone of voice customization tool. Users can choose from various tones, including \"Excited,\" \"Creative,\" and more. This feature adds a unique twist to the content. However, it's essential to note that the tone of voice feature may require additional editing to ensure the content is clear and coherent.

However, it may not be suitable for everyone.\nCheck out our in-depth AI-Writer review to see if it's the solution for you.\nAI-Writer is a word generator that is easily accessible and is popular among freelancers and bloggers. It may not be as extensive as Anyword or CopyAI, which are primarily aimed at marketing and sales, but it serves its intended audience well.\nOne of the most significant advantages of AI-Writer is its unparalleled sourcing capabilities. It is the only AI content generator that cites sources for \"everything it writes.\" Additionally, it updates its sources frequently, ensuring that any article generated by it sources the latest information on the subject. This is a significant advantage, particularly for those who are writing about current events or trending topics. With AI-Writer, writers can create content that is well-researched and accurate, without having to spend hours scouring the internet for sources.\nAnother significant advantage of AI-Writer is that it recognizes that not all types of content require sourcing. For instance, op-eds or personal essays don't usually require sources. AI-Writer recognizes this and hides sources and links from the main results page, making it easier for writers to focus on editing or rewriting content and not worry about sources, though arguably if looking to write professionally that's not a good habit to get into.\nOne of the drawbacks of using AI-Writer is that its extensive sourcing process can cause a minor delay in generating results compared to other AI writing tools. Although this may not be a significant issue, the noticeable delay should be mentioned. For instance, alternative tools like GrammarlyGO offer results without hesitation. However, it is worth noting that the issue with AI-Writer is primarily due to its thorough sourcing process.\nIn conclusion, AI-Writer is an excellent tool for people new to writing who want to create content quickly. It excels in sourcing capabilities, making it a go-to tool for writers who need well-researched and accurate content. While it may not be the fastest tool on the market, its thorough sourcing process is worth the wait.\nRead our full AI-Writer review.\nTechRadar's AI writer rankings\nNumerous AI writing solutions are already available in the market, and we can expect more to arrive in the future.

Whichever platform you choose, you will have to do some editing, if you want to create useful texts.\nHere are some of the factors you should consider when choosing the right tool for you:\n1. Ease of use\nTools that don\u2019t require technical knowledge or prior experience should be on the top of your list. Investment in good UI means that other aspects of the tool are also likely to be of a higher quality.\n2. Price\nWhile this may not be popular with everyone, the price should play a major role in deciding which tool to go for. Some are simply overpriced while not offering much more than their lower-priced competition. Pay attention to the amount of content each price plan offers.\n3. High-quality output\nDespite the fact that, in the end, you will be editing the texts and images the tool creates, having a tool that creates high-quality content will mean less time spent on fixing mistakes and editing.\n4.

  "argos_summary": "Huawei has announced its intention to open-source its CANN software toolkit for Ascend AI GPUs, aiming to compete with Nvidia's CUDA, which has dominated the market for nearly two decades. This move is designed to foster a more open ecosystem for developers, potentially accelerating the adoption of Huawei's AI technology. While the performance of Ascend chips is reportedly improving, the success of CANN will depend on its ability to support existing AI frameworks and attract a developer community, especially in light of Nvidia's entrenched position.",
