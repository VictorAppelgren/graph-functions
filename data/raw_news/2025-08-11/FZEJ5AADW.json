  "description": "The man known in the U.S. as Nicholas Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, is accused of sexually assaulting two women in Utah in 2008.",
  "content": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 A man accused of faking his death and fleeing the country to avoid rape charges faced an alleged victim in court Monday as a jury trial in Utah began.\n\nThe man known in the U.S. as Nicholas Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, is accused of sexually assaulting two women in Utah in 2008. Prosecutors are trying the cases separately, with the first set in Salt Lake County.\n\nRossi, 38, was arrested in Scotland in 2021 \u2014 a year after he was reported dead \u2014 when he was recognized at a Glasgow hospital while receiving treatment for COVID-19. He lost an extradition appeal after claiming he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who had never set foot on American soil and was being framed.\n\nProsecutors say they have identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.\n\nRossi appeared in court in a wheelchair, wearing a suit and tie and using an oxygen tank. The woman identified him from the witness stand, saying he\u2019s \u201ca little bit heavier, a little bit older\u201d but mostly looks the same.\n\nDistrict Judge Barry Lawrence helped clarify for the jury some of the twists and turns of the case, explaining that different people may refer to Rossi by different names. The defense and prosecution agreed it\u2019s factual that Rossi was in Utah in 2008 and had a relationship with the alleged victim that year.\n\nProsecutors painted a picture of an intelligent man who used his charm to take advantage of a vulnerable young woman. He raped her when she pushed back against his attempts to control her, said Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Brandon Simmons.\n\nThe woman, who the judge asked not be identified publicly, described a whirlwind relationship with Rossi that began in November 2008 while she was recovering from a traumatic brain injury. The two began dating after she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist and were engaged within about two weeks.\n\nThe woman described being asked to pay for their dates, cover Rossi\u2019s rent so he wouldn\u2019t be evicted from his apartment and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. Then, the relationship spiraled quickly, with Rossi \u201cbecoming controlling and saying mean things to me,\u201d she testified.\n\nThe couple got into a fight in which Rossi pounded on her car and used his body to block her from pulling out of the parking garage. She finally let him inside and drove him home but said she had no plans of continuing a relationship. She agreed to go into his house to talk, but he instead pushed her onto his bed, held her down and \u201cforced me to have sex with him,\u201d she testified. The woman described lying still, paralyzed with fear.\n\n\u201cI was a little bit more of a timid person back then, and so it was harder for me to stand up for myself,\u201d she said.\n\nDismissive comments from her parents convinced her not to go to the police at the time, she said. She did, however, try to bring Rossi to small claims court over the engagement rings but dropped the case.\n\nRossi\u2019s lawyers sought to convince the jury that the alleged victim built up years of resentment after Rossi made her foot the bill for everything in their monthlong relationship, and accused him of rape to get back at him a decade later when she saw him in the news.\n\nRossi will also stand trial in September over another rape charge in Utah County.\n\nRossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and had returned to the state before allegedly faking his death. An obituary published online claimed he died on Feb. 29, 2020, of late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. State police, along with Rossi\u2019s former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead. A year later, hospital staff in Scotland recognized his tattoos from an Interpol notice and alerted authorities. He was extradited to Utah in January 2024.\n\n\u201cThis case is like an old puzzle from the thrift store,\u201d said MacKenzie Potter, one of Rossi\u2019s attorneys. \u201cIt\u2019s 13 years old, not all the pieces are there, some pieces are from a different puzzle. And when you start going through everything, you\u2019re not going to get a complete picture.\u201d\n\nProsecutors pushed back, saying that if any \u201cpuzzle pieces\u201d are missing, it\u2019s because Rossi\u2019s attorneys fought to have some evidence dismissed.",

      "text": "Nicholas Alahverdian was known in Rhode Island as a fierce advocate for children in the state\u2019s foster care system. After his apparent death from cancer four years ago, he was memorialized in local news reports and on the statehouse floor.\nBut Alahverdian, 37, wasn\u2019t dead \u2014 he was living in the United Kingdom under a different name \u2014 and underneath his advocacy work was a trail of rape, abuse and fraud allegations that included multiple victims and spanned thousands of miles.\nIn a 2022 interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d Alahverdian denied sexually assaulting or defrauding anyone, though he previously pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault in Rhode Island and was convicted of a misdemeanor sex crime in Ohio. In Utah, where authorities have identified him as Nicholas Rossi, he is awaiting trial in two separate rape cases. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nHere\u2019s a look at Alahverdian\u2019s trail of allegations from Rhode Island to Utah and beyond.\nPROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND\nAn impressive start for a young advocate\nFor a time, the man born Nicholas Alahverdian went by Nicholas Rossi, after his adoptive stepfather. After ending up in foster care, Alahverdian began working as a page, then a legislative aide, at the Rhode Island statehouse in the 2000s.\nHis initiative and intellect impressed lawmakers \u2014 \u201cHe would read bills that most reps and senators wouldn\u2019t read,\u201d one former representative told \u201cDateline\u201d \u2014 and with their help, he later began advocating for reforms to a foster system that he said had failed to protect him from being beaten and tortured.\nAlahverdian led rallies, held news conferences and filed a federal lawsuit accusing state officials of conspiracy and other allegations. The Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families denied the allegations and settled the suit, court records show. The details of that settlement have not been disclosed.\nDAYTON, OHIO\nFiring back after being ordered to register as a sex offender\nIn January 2008, Alahverdian, then 21, had left Rhode Island for college and was living in Dayton.\nThere, he reached out to a woman on Myspace and told her he was new in town and looking for friends, the woman, Mary Grebinski, told \u201cDateline.\u201d While walking Grebinski to class at a local community college, she said that he cornered and sexually assaulted her \u2014 then apologized and pleaded with her not to speak to authorities.\nAlahverdian, who said the encounter was consensual, was charged with public indecency and sexual imposition, a misdemeanor crime indicating sexual contact against a person\u2019s will, court records show.\nAfter a trial, Alahverdian was fined and ordered to register as a sex offender. He later sued Grebinski in federal court for defamation and other allegations, alleging in part that she \u201ctargeted\u201d him with \u201ccriminal litigation because of her unfaithful relationships and infidelity.\u201d\nA judge dismissed the suit with prejudice, saying there was no basis to Alahverdian\u2019s claims.\nOREM, UTAH\nA rape kit backlog and a charge a decade later\nIn September 2008, Alahverdian was accused of raping his 21-year-old ex-girlfriend, a probable cause affidavit shows. The woman, identified in the document as K.P., told authorities that she\u2019d met Alahverdian via Myspace and dated him briefly, but broke it off after he became increasingly aggressive and borrowed money without paying her back, according to the affidavit.\nOn Sept. 13, she went to his home after he told her he\u2019d pay her what he owed her, the affidavit alleges, but instead he raped her. K.P. had a sexual assault kit completed the next day, but a backlog in testing meant that Alahverdian was not identified as a suspect until a decade later, authorities said.\nIn 2020, Utah County prosecutors charged him with rape. Alahverdian pleaded not guilty.\nA trial is set for September 2025.\nSOUTH SALT LAKE, UTAH\nA marriage proposal, a disputed loan and an alleged attack\nIn December 2008, a woman identified in court documents as M.S. accused Alahverdian of raping her at his home after they argued about breaking up.\nThey\u2019d met online, dated briefly and he\u2019d bought wedding rings after proposing, according to a probable cause declaration. But the woman described him as manipulative and said she\u2019d loaned him money that he refused to pay back.\nAt his home in South Salt Lake, the declaration alleges, he refused to let her leave and threw her on the bed and held down her wrists while forcing himself on her.\nHe was charged in the alleged attack after his identification in the earlier sexual assault case. Alahverdian pleaded not guilty and a trial is set for April 2025.\nPAWTUCKET, RHODE ISLAND\nA crying baby triggers an assault\nIn November 2010, days after Alahverdian returned to his home state and got married, he was arrested after allegedly assaulting his wife. A police report shows the alleged assault happened during an argument over a crying baby.\nShe accused him of knocking her to the ground, holding her down, grabbing her neck, striking her in the face and refusing to let her leave, according to the report, which noted that an officer photographed the woman\u2019s injuries.\nAlahverdian denied the assault, according to the report, and when he was taken into custody officers pepper sprayed him when they say he refused to stop banging his head into the police car\u2019s back window.\nHe pleaded no contest to misdemeanor domestic assault and was sentenced to probation, court records show. The couple later divorced.\nDAYTON, OHIO\nAnother relationship sours and more allegations emerge\nBy 2015, Alahverdian had returned to Ohio and established the Community Progress Institute, a nonprofit that aimed to revitalize downtown Dayton, according to his ex-wife, Kathryn Heckendorn.\nThey\u2019d met at church and married in October 2015. But in a divorce complaint filed months later, Heckendorn accused him of \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d and \u201cgross neglect of duty,\u201d saying he\u2019d borrowed $52,000 and failed to pay her back.\nIn an interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d Heckendorn said he once locked her in a bathroom for two days and had raped her when she refused to have sex with him.\nIn a divorce filing, Alahverdian denied the cruelty allegation and said the money was not a loan \u2014 it was a gift \u2014 but agreed that a divorce should be granted.\nIn an interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d he denied sexually assaulting anyone.\nMONTREAL\nA professional deal goes belly-up\nIn February 2020, TV personality Nafsika Antypas hired Alahverdian to help market her vegan cheese company and A&E television show. Alahverdian identified himself as Timothy Arthur Nicholas Knight Brown, and he described himself as an Ireland-based Ivy League graduate with a background in public relations and international law, Antypas told \u201cDateline.\u201d\nShe paid him $30,000, Anytpas said, but he never delivered.\nWhen Antypas cut off his access to her website, she said, he began sending threatening messages telling her to pay him another $40,000 or make what he described as a \u201creasonable counteroffer.\u201d Otherwise, she recalled him saying, he\u2019d ruin her reputation.\nWhen Antypas told him he was fired, she said, social media posts appeared claiming her vegan cheese was fake, as did a \u201cfraud alert\u201d website that had her passport photo framed as a mug shot.\nAntypas said she called the police and hired a private investigator to learn more about the man she\u2019d hired, but the investigator found nothing under the name Alahverdian had provided, she said.\nIt wasn\u2019t until two years later, when Alahverdian was arrested on the rape charges from Utah, that Antypas learned his real identity.\nAlahverdian \u2014 who completed one extension course at Harvard \u2014 disputed Antypas\u2019 account in an interview with \u201cDateline.\u201d Antypas paid him for \u201cwork that was performed,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not scam her out of money.\u201d\nPROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND\nAlahverdian is reported dead\nOn March 3, 2020, a local news station announced Alahverdian\u2019s death, saying he\u2019d died after a long battle with cancer.\nOn the statehouse floor, a lawmaker remembered him as a \u201cvery, very smart individual\u201d who\u2019d been a powerful advocate for change for the state\u2019s foster youth.\nAn online obituary said Alahverdian died Feb. 29, 2020, at age 32 from non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He was cremated, the obituary stated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.\nGLASGOW, SCOTLAND\nA new identity and a new accent\nIn January 2022, authorities in Utah announced that they were seeking to extradite a man believed to be Alahverdian after he was arrested in Scotland under the name Arthur Knight.\nHe\u2019d fled the United States to avoid prosecution, the Utah Public Safety Department said in a statement, and was a suspect in that state in connection with one of the 2008 rapes.\nBut in interviews with \u201cDateline\u201d and other media outlets, Alahverdian denied sexually assaulting anyone and insisted he was not Alahverdian or Nicholas Rossi.\nSpeaking with a British accent and appearing in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank and mask that he said were necessary after a recent bout of Covid, he claimed he was Arthur Knight, an Irish orphan who\u2019d become a businessman and was married to a woman whom he\u2019d met at a London museum in 2011.\nEDINBURGH, SCOTLAND\nTwo names, one U.S. rape suspect\nIn November 2022, the Scottish judge overseeing the extradition case ruled that Arthur Knight and Nicholas Alahverdian were the same person \u2014 a conclusion he reached after reviewing photographs and fingerprints, according to the judge\u2019s order.\nYet, Alahverdian wasn\u2019t extradited to the United States for more than a year, as his lawyer appealed and claimed in part that the case should be dismissed because Alahverdian was wanted for questioning in connection with an alleged rape in England, according to the U.K. wire service PA Media. No charges were ever filed in the case.\nPROVO, UTAH\nFacing trial\nTwo months ago, on Oct. 16, 10 months after Alahverdian was extradited to Utah and booked into jail, he testified during a bail hearing for the Utah County case that he was, in fact, Nicholas Alahverdian. He\u2019d moved to the U.K. and changed his name, he testified, partly because there were two \u201ccredible threats\u201d against his life made by people in Rhode Island over his foster youth advocacy.\nTo protect himself, he testified, he changed his name to Arthur Knight Brown \u2014 a name he said he\u2019d always respected. Alahverdian would not identify the people he said were threatening him in open court. That, he said, would \u201cstoke the fire they\u2019ve had to continue their actions against me.\u201d\nThe judge held a closed hearing on the matter and did not discuss those details in his ruling, though he noted that when Alahverdian left the U.S. in 2017, he was being investigated for fraud and told an FBI agent that he was moving to a country without an extradition treaty. (In an interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d Alahverdian said he had not defrauded anyone. The FBI\u2019s Utah field office would not comment.)\nThe judge ruled that Alahverdian had strong incentives to flee the area and denied him bail. Alahverdian pleaded not guilty and remains in custody in Utah County."

      "text": "A Rhode Island man faked his death to evade sexual assault charges before he was found alive \u2014 suffering from Covid-19 \u2014 and arrested in Scotland, authorities said Thursday.\nThe man, Nicholas Rossi, who also goes by the aliases Nicholas Alahverdian and Nicholas Alahverdian Rossi, is wanted in connection with allegations of a sex assault in Orem, Utah, in 2008 and an attack in Ohio in 2018, the Utah County Attorney's Office said in a statement.\nHe was arrested using another alias, Arthur Knight, at a hospital in Glasgow and is being watched by police, Utah officials said.\nUtah County Attorney David O. Leavitt admitted that had Rossi not contracted Covid and needed medical care, he would still probably be living \"off the grid\" successfully.\n\"It's a lot more difficult than people imagine,\" Leavitt said Thursday.\n\"People may not know where you are, but with social media, the world is small enough that if anyone sees a picture of you ... if you're going to be off the grid, you better stay in your house and never leave, because someone is going to see you,\" he said.\nRossi \"fled the country to avoid prosecution\" and \"attempted to lead investigators and state legislators in other states to believe that he was deceased,\" Utah prosecutors said in a statement.\nVarious news outlets in 2020 cited the memorial website EverLoved.com in reporting that Rossi had died Feb. 29 from non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\"Mr. Rossi was discovered to be living under an assumed name in Scotland,\" the Utah County Attorney\u2019s Office said. \"He has been taken into custody and the Utah County Attorney\u2019s Office is working with federal and international agencies to extradite Mr. Rossi back to Utah.\"\nLeavitt thanked Orem police, the Utah State Bureau of Investigation and his office's investigators, who he said used the latest DNA technology to follow up on the 2008 case.\n\u201cOur hats are off to the people who stuck with this and made it happen,\" Leavitt said. \"There was lots of hard work behind the scenes.\"\nRossi has been charged with one count of alleged rape, in the attack on a 21-year-old woman on Sept. 13, 2008, according to prosecutor\u2019s affidavit.\nA Rhode Island lawyer who has previously represented Rossi said Thursday that when he was informed that Rossi was reported to have died in 2020, he didn't completely buy it.\n\"I'm not going to lie to you, a part of me found it a bit suspicious,\" said the lawyer, Jeffrey Pine, who was Rhode Island\u2019s attorney general from 1993 to 1999.\nPine represented Rossi in 2018 and 2019 on a charge that he had failed to properly register as a sex offender because of a previous out-of-state sex crime conviction.\n\u201cI found the circumstances a little suspicious,\" Pine said of the reports of Rossi's death. \"But on the other hand, I accepted what his wife told me. I mean, I don\u2019t want to insult someone by saying they\u2019re not dead. So I accepted it at face value.\u201d\nHe added: \"However, there was a part of me, in my years as a prosecutor have taught me, to be a little suspicious.\"\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear Thursday whether Rossi had hired a new attorney to possibly fight extradition. Utah prosecutors claim that they have enough DNA and fingerprint evidence to extradite him."
