  "title": "Don\u2019t Buy the Dips Blindly, Warns John Stotzfus",
  "description": "John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, discusses how clients view the recent market selloff and calls this a \u201cvery interesting time\u201d for intermediate and long-term investors. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "How would you explain in the last few days, the clients? Well, I would say very simply, it is to be expected that after a tremendous run up from the lows on April 8th that we're tested and then all of a sudden we came back very powerfully over the course of, I guess, the last three weeks or so. You can't go up every day. And we've got a great catalyst for for bears, skeptics and nervous investors to take profits without FOMO right now or fear of missing out myths of what's likely a secular bull market. Because you have the Fed on Friday in Jackson Hole. Then beyond that, everybody's looking for the first week in September where you get the jobs number. What's the story going to be? Are we going to get another set of worrisome revisions? Is it going to be a big miss in terms versus expectations and all that really in the process of some really heavy duty transitions related to technology and innovation, related to A.I., as well as an administration that really, you know, for all the criticism it gets in some ways is dealing with cans that have been kicked down the proverbial road for decades by both sides of the aisle. And so with that kind of uncertainty, what happens is you get some turbulence in the market. But we say don't just buy. You don't want to buy the dips just blindly. You want to look for babies that get thrown out with the bathwater it for intermediate and long term investors. Very interesting time, I think, to see things like that. And for traders in any turbulence, that's where they make their money.",
