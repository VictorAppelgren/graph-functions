  "content": "Smartbroker Holding AG (ETR:SB1) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Smartbroker Holding AG operates as online broker in Germany. On 31 December 2024, the \u20ac208m market-cap company posted a loss of \u20ac1.4m for its most recent financial year. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Smartbroker Holding will turn a profit, with the big question being \u201cwhen will the company breakeven?\u201d In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nConsensus from 2 of the German Interactive Media and Services analysts is that Smartbroker Holding is on the verge of breakeven. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2026, before turning a profit of \u20ac100k in 2027. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 2 years from now. In order to meet this breakeven date, we calculated the rate at which the company must grow year-on-year. It turns out an average annual growth rate of 0.7% is expected, which is relatively conservative. If this rate turns out to be too low, the company may become profitable faster than analysts expect.\n\nWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Smartbroker Holding given that this is a high-level summary, though, keep in mind that by and large periods of lower growth in the upcoming years is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Smartbroker Holding\n\nOne thing we\u2019d like to point out is that The company has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 13% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.\n\nThere are too many aspects of Smartbroker Holding to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place \u2013 Smartbroker Holding's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also put together a list of essential factors you should look at:\n\u2022 Valuation: What is Smartbroker Holding worth today?

  "argos_summary": "Smartbroker Holding AG, a German online broker with a \u20ac208m market cap, posted a \u20ac1.4m loss in 2024 but is projected to break even in 2027 with an average annual growth rate of 0.7%. Analysts see a modest path to profitability, citing low debt (13% of equity) and a fair value estimate of \u20ac23.43 versus the current \u20ac12.40 price. The company\u2019s valuation is considered significantly undervalued, with a price\u2011to\u2011sales ratio of 4x against an industry average of 1.6x. The outlook is based on Simply Wall St analysis and analyst consensus forecasts.",
