      "summary": "Morningstar warns that the S&P 500’s extreme concentration—40% of the index now held by the top ten stocks, eight of which are tech firms—creates outsized downside risk if any of those names falter.  Weak labor market growth, sticky inflation, and ongoing tariff‑driven price pressures could prompt the Fed to keep rates high or cut them only to support a weakening economy, further tightening the market.  Pappalardo advises diversifying into international, small‑cap, and healthcare stocks to mitigate the concentration risk.",
