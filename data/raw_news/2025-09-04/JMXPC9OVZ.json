  "title": "Sale of Masonic Lodge building in Little Falls invites ownership of a piece of history.",
  "description": "The former Little Falls Masonic Lodge property is listed for sale. The magnificent structure designed French Gothic Style holds history in its eaves.",
  "content": "Want to purchase a Masonic Lodge? It will cost you almost half a million dollars.\n\n\u201cStep back in time, specifically 1914, and immerse yourself in a place of mystery and magnificence, a grand building where we can imagine the secret meetings, voices, and music that once echoed in the halls. Step inside one of the few modern monoliths that remain standing firm...of the Masonic Lodge.\u201d\n\nSo reads the description by River Hills Properties, the listing agent for the sale of 5 and 9 Prospect Street in Little Falls, almost 17,000 square feet of history sitting on just under half an acre for an asking price of $100 shy of half a million dollars.\n\nThe Masonic Lodge that sets \u201cmajestically\u201d on the corner of Prospect and School Streets in the city was built in 1914, amid a period between 1870 and 1920 known as \u201cThe Golden Age of Fraternalism.\u201d Architect, William Neil Smith cited the French Medieval Period as inspiring its design in French Gothic style, it is often referred to as a castle.\n\nIt is aptly constructed with stone, brick, and cement stucco and boasts terra cotta roofs with copper flashing.\n\nAt that time, the Mohawk Valley Region\u2019s location along the Erie Canal, allowed it with ease to attract immigrant labor while able to easily trade their goods along the Canal and the Mohawk, St. Lawrence, and Hudson river sheds. In a region rich with dairy farms, Little Falls enjoyed the designation of \u201cCheese Capital of the World,\u201d a period of prosperity reflected in the grandeur of their Masonic Lodge.\n\nFitting, it is, that the realtor invites you to \u201cstep inside one of the few modern monoliths that remain standing firm,\u201d as the ethereal, centuries-old international fraternal organization that is the Freemasons - referred to by author and historian Jasper Ridley as \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful secret society\u201d - began as a fraternal guild of stone masons, specifically masons who worked the finer stone that appointed the grander spaces. Sources differ in their origin, not surprising in the case of a secret society.\n\nThere is consensus that they are the oldest secular order still in existence.\n\nIn the State of New York, there are 429 operating Masonic Lodges, according to the region\u2019s Grand Lodge of New York, located at 71 West 23rd Street in Manhattan, which was established in 1781. But the Masons have been suffering a decline in U.S. membership since 1957, according to the Masonic Service Association of North America, when their population peaked at just over 4 million.\n\nAccording to Robin Mongeau, the principal of River Hills Properties, who has an office in Little Falls, and is the listing agent for the Masonic Lodge property, that decline was suffered in kind by the Little Falls chapter.\n\nIn response to the decline in their membership, the Little Falls Freemasons sold the property to Charles and Theresa Tippin, prominent citizens of the city, in 1995. The Tippin family turned one upper floor into a private residence and operated a pottery business on the lower level.\n\nThe family invited the Freemasons to continue to hold their meetings there in the Masonic Lodge Room.\n\n\u201cIt is soundproof, and you cannot see into it,\u201d Mongeau described, sharing that the room has a balcony and a giant pipe organ, similar to a church.\n\nIn 2010, when their numbers had dwindled so much that they could no longer support a lodge/chapter, the Little Falls Freemasons merged with the Masonic Lodge in Dolgeville, which remains an operating lodge in good standing.\n\n\u201cTheresa Tippin really had an invested interest in Little Falls,\u201d said Mongeau. \u201cShe was well known for embracing the community and opening up the property so everyone could enjoy the magnificence of the building.\u201d\n\nMongeau said it would not surprise her if Tippin did not charge the Masons or anyone who imagined the other uses since they sold it, which include a nursery school, a performance space, and a venue for special events.\n\nAccording to Mongeau, the property was sold in 2017 to Daniel Preston, who was based in New York City.\n\n\u201cLittle Falls attracts a lot of people from New York City,\u201d said Mongue, \u201cbecause of its great architecture at affordable price points.\u201d\n\nPreston invested approximately $6 million in real estate in Little Falls at the time, including the Overlook Mansion, Hansen Island, and the Snyder Building, in addition to the lodge, according to the realtor.\n\nPreston was no absentee landlord; he reportedly loved the little upstate city and planned to curate the properties to its benefit. Tragically, he died of cancer before he could bring those plans to life.\n\n\u201cLittle Falls lost someone who had wonderful ideas to benefit the community,\u201d said Mongeau, \u201cand he had the resources to implement them.\u201d\n\nPreston\u2019s assets were gathered into the Stay Well Trust, governed by one trustee in New York City and another in San Diego, which is endeavoring to liquidate Preston\u2019s real estate in Little Falls.\n\nMongeau speaks of being chosen to represent the properties with a palpable sense of reverence and responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t get to choose the buyers who might make an offer or which offer the Trustees accept,\u201d said Mongeau, \u201cI put what I call \u2018the vibe\u2019 out there, hoping to attract the right buyer for these properties and this community.\u201d\n\nMongeau also represents the Overlook Mansion and shared her enthusiasm that it just went under contract to one of those \u201cright buyers.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle Falls is a cool city,\u201d said Mongeau with undeniable sincerity, \u201cand they\u2019ve got a great mayor.\"\n\nAnd while the Masonic Lodge \u2013 the \u201ccastle\u201d -- on Prospect Street looks a bit out of place surrounded there by far more humble homes and businesses, Mongeau predicts, probably not for long?\n\nShe likens the recent renaissance of Little Falls to Saratoga Springs, New York States \u201cSpa City.\u201d\n\nSaid Mongeau, \u201cI feel like Little Falls is on the verge of great things.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Observer-Dispatch: Little Falls Masonic Lodge \u2018on sale\u2019 for less than $500,000",
