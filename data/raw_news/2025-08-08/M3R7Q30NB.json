  "title": "An EPA proposal could lead U.S. auto makers to shift their strategy on EVs",
  "description": "An EPA proposal seeks to revoke a key emissions finding which experts say would remove pressure on auto makers to produce EVs.",
  "content": "A new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal to revoke a landmark greenhouse gas finding could reshape the auto industry, which until now has had to abide by strict emissions guidelines.\n\nThe EPA on July 29 announced it is planning to revoke an \"endangerment finding\" from 2009 that has served as the legal and scientific basis for the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions across multiple industries, including motor vehicles, power plants, oil and gas producers and aircraft. The proposal, which still needs to go through a public comment period, focuses on regulations affecting the auto industry. If passed, it would repeal all greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.\n\n\"With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for auto makers and American consumers,\" Lee Zeldin, the administrator of EPA, stated in the announcement.\n\nStrict standards for emissions and fuel efficiency introduced during the Obama administration and expanded during the Biden administration, which also provided generous EV funding, has led many auto makers to add electric vehicles to their fleets in recent years. Others, like Volvo, have taken things a step further and committed to a fully electric future. But the landscape is shifting under President Trump, who has pushed forward a deregulatory agenda.\n\nExperts say that if this proposal passes, it will ease pressure on auto makers to produce electric cars, enabling them to adapt their mix of EV and gas-powered vehicle offerings to meet consumer demand.\n\n\"It gives auto makers a little bit better ability to build, to produce and put vehicles on market that are more closely aligned with the pace of electric adoption right now,\" said Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global.\n\nJohn Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most of the major car manufacturers in the U.S., said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the trade association is reviewing the announcement.\n\n\"At the same time,\" he added, \"there's no question the vehicle emissions regulations finalized under the previous administration aren't achievable and should be revised to reflect current market conditions, to keep the auto industry in America competitive, and to keep the industry on a path of vehicle choice and lower emissions.\"\n\nA spokesperson from the EPA said Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks and that the agency's proposal to revoke the endangerment finding \"does not prohibit vehicle manufacturers from developing EVs or different vehicles.\"",

      "text": "With five fully electric cars (EVs) already on the market and another five models in development, full electrification remains a key pillar of Volvo Cars\u2019 product strategy. Its long-term aim remains to become a fully electric car company, and it also aims to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.\nWhile Volvo Cars will retain its position as an industry leader in electrification, it has now decided to adjust its electrification ambitions due to changing market conditions and customer demands.\nGoing forward, Volvo Cars aims for 90 to 100 per cent of its global sales volume by 2030 to consist of electrified cars, meaning a mix of both fully electric and plug-in hybrid models \u2013 in essence, all cars with a cord.\nThe remaining 0-10 per cent will allow for a limited number of mild hybrid models to be sold, if needed. This replaces the company\u2019s previous ambition for its line-up to be fully electric by 2030.\nBy 2025, it expects the percentage of electrified products to come in between 50 and 60 per cent. Well before the end of this decade Volvo Cars will have a complete line-up of fully electric cars available. That will allow Volvo Cars to make the move to full electrification as and when the market conditions are suitable.\nVolvo Cars\u2019 share of fully electric cars stood at 26 per cent during the second quarter of 2024, the highest share among all its premium peers. Its electrified share \u2013 EVs and plug-in hybrids \u2013 accounted for 48 per cent.\nVolvo Cars remains committed to its long-term ambition of full electrification, and the company\u2019s long-term investment plan and product strategy remains geared towards fully electric cars. The adjustment to its ambitions is not expected to have any material impact on the company's capital expenditure plans.\nVolvo Cars continues to develop its plug-in and mild hybrid cars, providing it with a balanced portfolio that serves as a clear bridge to an all-electric future.\nSince the company laid out its ambition to go fully electric, it has launched five fully electric models: the EX40, the EC40, the EX30, the EM90 and the EX90. The EX30 is currently ranked as the third best-selling EV in Europe, according to the latest available industry data.\nAt the same time, there has been a slower than expected rollout of charging infrastructure, withdrawal of government incentives in some markets and additional uncertainties created by recent tariffs on EVs in various markets. With this in mind, Volvo Cars continues to see the need for stronger and more stable government policies to support the transition to electrification.\nThe strategic adjustments to its electrification ambitions ensure that Volvo Cars has a flexible plan that meets customer preferences and enables value creation as a business.\n\u201cWe are resolute in our belief that our future is electric,\u201d said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Volvo Cars. \u201cAn electric car provides a superior driving experience and increases possibilities for using advanced technologies that improve the overall customer experience. However, it is clear that the transition to electrification will not be linear, and customers and markets are moving at different speeds of adoption. We are pragmatic and flexible, while retaining an industry-leading position on electrification and sustainability.\u201d\nUpdated CO2 reduction path\nAs a result of its adjusted ambitions on electrification, the company is also updating its ambitions on CO2 reduction, which remain leading for the automotive industry. By 2030, the company aims to have reduced CO2 emissions per car by 65-75 per cent compared to a 2018 baseline, an adjustment of the previous 75 per cent reduction ambition.\nFor 2025, the company aims for a 30-35 per cent reduction versus a 2018 baseline, instead of the previous aim of a 40 per cent reduction.\nVolvo Cars plans to make further progress, including by working with its suppliers to continue to reduce CO2 emissions from materials across the company\u2019s value chain.\nDuring the first half of the year CO2 emissions per car were 25 per cent lower compared with its 2018 benchmark.\nStrong progress\nWith the small EX30 SUV continuing to perform strongly and the first customers of the fully electric Volvo EX90 flagship receiving their cars during this month, the excitement about the opportunities for Volvo Cars\u2019 fully electric product range is stronger than ever. The EX90 represents a paradigm shift in technology, which will power a new era of Volvo Cars.\nVolvo Cars has also seen the popularity of its plug-in hybrids grow, with the XC60 the best-selling plug-in hybrid model in Europe this year, according to industry data. Plug-in hybrids provide customers with an opportunity to experience electric driving if they are not yet ready or able to switch to fully electric cars.\nMany of the company\u2019s plug-in hybrid customers already travel widely on zero tailpipe emissions. Volvo Cars\u2019 most recent data shows that around half of the kilometres covered by the latest plug-in hybrid Volvo cars are driven on pure electric power. The company will continue to upgrade its plug-in hybrids, to further increase electric usage and range, and improve the customer experience.\nMore information about the company strategy, investment plans and product roadmap will be set out at Volvo Cars\u2019 90/90 Event and Capital Markets Day, held today and tomorrow in Gothenburg, Sweden.\nThe small print\nVolvo Cars in 2023\nFor the full year 2023, Volvo Car Group recorded a record-breaking core operating profit of SEK 25.6 billion. Revenue in 2023 amounted to an all-time high of SEK 399.3 billion, while global sales reached a record 708,716 cars.\nAbout Volvo Car Group\nVolvo Cars was founded in 1927. Today, it is one of the most well-known and respected car brands in the world with sales to customers in more than 100 countries. Volvo Cars is listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, where it is traded under the ticker \u201cVOLCAR B\u201d.\n\"For life. To give people the freedom to move in a personal, sustainable and safe way.\" This purpose is reflected in Volvo Cars' ambition to become a fully electric car maker and in its commitment to an ongoing reduction of its carbon footprint, with the ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.\nAs of December 2023, Volvo Cars employed approximately 43,400 full-time employees. Volvo Cars' head office, product development, marketing and administration functions are mainly located in Gothenburg, Sweden.

      "text": "EPA to revoke \"endangerment finding,\" landmark basis for regulating greenhouse gases\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.\nKnown as the \"endangerment finding,\" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, \"the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.\"\nSince it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations.\nBut Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would \"repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver.\"\nDuring his appearance on the \"Ruthless Podcast,\" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution.\n\"There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\" he said.\nZeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it \"is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,\" according to the EPA press release.\nBut the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits.\nRepealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA.\n\"For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,\" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. \"The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem.\"\nLegality of the endangerment finding\nIn 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health.\nTwo years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations.\n\"I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,\" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government.\n\"This body of scientific evidence met the endangerment test of the Clean Air Act,\" they told CBS News. \"It has stood the test of time and the science has only gotten stronger.\"\nThe EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review.\nThe release also said the EPA will \"update scientific data and challenge the assumptions\" of the 2009 finding with a study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which was not peer-reviewed, but says greenhouse gases \"appear to be less damaging economically than commonly believed.\"\nPlenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement.\n\"Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,\" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement.\nThe finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.\nThe EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases \"have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,\" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA.\n\"The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\"\nImpacts of the endangerment finding\nSince it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA.\nNew passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates. The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits.\nBut according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, \"undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,\" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers.\nIn addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants, has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing.\n\"Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,\" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement."

      "text": "Senate confirms Lee Zeldin to lead EPA as Trump vows to cut climate rules\nThe Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday confirmed Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a key role to help President Trump fulfill his pledge to roll back major environmental regulations, including those aimed at slowing climate change and encouraging use of electric vehicles.\nThe vote was 56-42 in Zeldin's favor.\nZeldin, a former Republican congressman from New York, is a longtime Trump ally and served on Mr. Trump's defense team during his first impeachment. He voted against certifying Mr. Trump's 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden.\nZeldin, 44, said during his confirmation hearing that he has a moral responsibility to be a good steward of the environment and pledged to support career staff who have dedicated themselves to the agency's mission to protect human health and the environment.\nZeldin repeatedly declined to commit to specific policies, however, promising instead not to prejudge outcomes before arriving at EPA. When asked by Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska whether he would roll back programs that promote electric cars \u2014 a program Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized \u2014 Zeldin stayed vague but acknowledged he has heard Republican complaints.\nMr. Trump led efforts to dismantle more than 100 environmental protections during his first term and has promised to do so again, targeting what he falsely labels an electric vehicle \"mandate\" and \"green new scam\" approved by Democrats.\nMr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has vowed to overturn Biden's biggest climate accomplishments, including tailpipe regulations for vehicles and slashed pollution from power plants fired by coal and natural gas. Mr. Trump has already moved to oust career staff at EPA and other agencies, remove scientific advisers and close an office that helps minority communities that disproportionately struggle with polluted air and water.\nDemocratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island called Zeldin the wrong man for the job.\n\"We need an EPA administrator who will take climate change seriously, treat the science honestly and stand up where necessary to the political pressure that will be coming from the White House, where we have a president who actually thinks (climate change) is a hoax, and from the huge fossil fuel forces that propelled him into office with enormous amounts of political money and who now think they own the place,\" Whitehouse said in a Senate speech.\nMr. Trump is \"under the thumb of the fossil fuel industry,\" Whitehouse said, adding that the EPA administrator \"has to be truthful and factual and support and defend our environment and our safety from climate change.''\nHe has nothing against Zeldin personally, Whitehouse added, \"but the likelihood of him standing against that fossil fuel bulldozer that is coming at him is essentially zero. And in that context, this is very much the wrong guy.\"\nRepublican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Zeldin will return the EPA to its original mission of protecting America's air, water and land \u2014 without \"suffocating the economy.\"\nBarrasso called Zeldin \"a lifelong public servant\" and a seasoned lawyer with a sharp legal mind and over 20 years of military service.\nZeldin will continue Mr. Trump's \"mission to roll back punishing, political regulations\" at the EPA, \"cut red tape\" and oversee \"a new wave of creativity and innovation,'' Barrasso said.\n\"For the last four years, the so-called experts at the Environmental Protection Agency went on a reckless regulatory rampage,'' Barrasso said, referring to the Biden administration. \"They saddled American families and businesses with higher costs and heavy-handed restrictions. They bowed to climate extremism and ignored common sense.\"\nZeldin \"will right the ship and restore balance at the EPA,'' Barrasso said, citing likely actions to repeal Biden-era rules on tailpipe emissions and power plants, along with eliminating federal subsidies for electric vehicles.\nThe League of Conservation Voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin's lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy and manufacturing and fighting climate change.\nZeldin supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He's also supported local conservation efforts on Long Island.\nZeldin said at his Jan. 16 hearing that he wants to collaborate with the private sector \"to promote common-sense, smart regulation that will allow American innovation to continue to lead the world.\"\nThe EPA under his leadership \"will prioritize compliance as much as possible,\" Zeldin said. \"I believe in the rule of law and I want to work with people to ensure they do their part to protect the environment.\""

      "text": "Biden awards $1.7 billion to boost electric vehicle production in 8 states\n(CBS DETROIT) \u2013 The Biden administration is awarding $1.7 billion to auto manufacturing and assembly facilities in eight states for electric vehicle production.\nThe funding will go to 11 \"shuttered or at-risk\" facilities in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. The investments are intended to help create and retain well-paying union jobs at the facilities, according to the release.\n\"There is nothing harder to a manufacturing community than to lose jobs to foreign competition and a changing industry,\" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \"Even as our competitors invest heavily in electric vehicles, these grants ensure that our automotive industry stays competitive \u2014 and does it in the communities and with the workforce that have supported the auto industry for generations.\"\nThe funds for the awards come from the Inflation Reduction Act, and the selected projects would reportedly create over 2,900 new jobs and ensure 15,000 union workers are retained at all the facilities, according to the White House.\nAmong the recipients are two facilities in Michigan. A General Motors plant in Lansing will receive $500 million to convert a plant to electric vehicle production, and just over $150,000 will go to a ZF plant in Marysville for e-mobility conversion.\nA $32.6 million grant will go to American Autoparts, Inc., a subsidiary of Hyundai Mobis Co., to convert the existing Ohio plant to produce chassis for electric vehicles and create a new battery system assembly plant.\nAn idled Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois will be converted to assemble electric vehicles, with help from a $334.7 million grant. And $79.7 million will go to Blue Bird Body Company in Georgia to produce electric buses.\nThe facilities that were selected for this funding will negotiate before they receive the awards, which will allow them to make a variety of products for the automotive supply chain, including parts for electric motorcycles and school buses, hybrid powertrains, heavy-duty commercial truck batteries and electric SUVs, according to the release."

      "text": "New vehicles in the U.S. must average 40 mpg by 2026, up from 28 mpg\nNew vehicles sold in the United States will have to travel an average of at least 40 miles per gallon of gasoline in 2026, up from about 28 mpg, under new federal rules unveiled Friday.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said its fuel economy requirements will undo a rollback of standards enacted under President Donald Trump. For the current model year, standards enacted under Trump require the fleet of new vehicles to get just under 28 miles per gallon in real-world driving. The new requirements increase gas mileage by 8% per year for 2024 and 2025 year models and 10% for 2026 models.\nAgency officials say the requirements are the maximum the industry can achieve over the time period and will reduce gasoline consumption by more than 220 billion gallons over the life of vehicles, compared with the Trump standards.\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department includes the NHTSA, said the rules also will help strengthen national security by making the country less dependent on foreign oil and less vulnerable to volatile gasoline prices. Gasoline nationwide has spiked to an average of more than $4.22 per gallon, with much of the increase coming since Russia, a major oil producer, invaded Ukraine in late February. It cost $2.88 per gallon just a year ago, according to AAA.\nGas prices also have helped fuel inflation to a 40-year high, eating up household budgets and hitting President Joe Biden's approval ratings.\n\"Transportation is the second-largest cost for American families, only behind housing,\" Buttigieg said. The new standards, he said, will help keep the U.S. more secure and preserve \"the freedom of our country to chart its future without being subject to other countries and to the decisions that are being made in the boardrooms of energy companies.\"\nBut auto dealers say more stringent requirements drive up prices and push people out of an already expensive new-car market.\nUndoing Trump rollback\nTrump's administration rolled back fuel economy standards, allowing them to rise 1.5% per year, which environmental groups said was inadequate to limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change. The standards had been rising about 5% per year previously.\nBut the new standards won't immediately match those adopted through 2025 under President Barack Obama. NHTSA officials said they will equal the Obama standards by 2025 and slightly exceed them for the 2026 model year.\nThe Obama-era standards automatically adjusted for changes in the type of vehicles people are buying. When they were enacted in 2012, 51% of new vehicle sales were cars and 49% SUVs and trucks. Last year, 77% of new vehicle sales were SUVs and trucks, which generally are less efficient than cars.\nSome environmental groups said the new requirements from NHTSA under Biden don't go far enough to fight global warming. Others supported the new standards as a big step toward reducing emissions.\n\"Climate change has gotten much worse, but these rules only require automakers to reduce gas-guzzling slightly more than they agreed to cut nine years ago,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Center at the Center for Biological Diversity.\nHe said the final rule is about 2 mpg short of the strongest alternative that NHTSA considered.\nSavings for motorists\nOfficials said that under the new standards, owners would save about $1,400 in gasoline costs during the lifetime of a 2029 model year vehicle. Carbon dioxide emissions would drop by 2.5 billion metric tons by 2050 under the standards, the NHTSA said.\nAutomakers are investing billions of dollars to develop and build electric vehicles but say government support is needed to get people to buy them. The companies want government tax credits to reduce prices as well as more money for EV charging stations to ease anxiety over running out of juice.\nStellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, said Friday it's investing $35 billion on electric and hybrid vehicles to become carbon neutral by 2038.\n\"These aims are critical to a sustainable future, and are more likely to be realized with government support for a widespread EV recharging network, point-of-sale EV purchase incentives and inducements to expand electric-vehicle manufacturing in the U.S.,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe NHTSA sets fuel economy requirements, while the Environmental Protection Agency develops limits on greenhouse gas emissions. NHTSA officials said their requirements nearly match rules adopted in December by the EPA, so automakers don't have to comply with two rules."

  "argos_summary": "The EPA has proposed revoking a key 2009 'endangerment finding' that established the basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions across various industries, including the auto sector. If finalized, this proposal would eliminate existing greenhouse gas standards for all vehicle types, potentially easing production pressures on automakers and allowing for a greater mix of electric and gas-powered vehicles. Meanwhile, Volvo Cars is adjusting its electrification goals in response to market conditions, aiming for 90-100% of its sales to be electrified by 2030, while also updating its CO2 reduction targets.",
