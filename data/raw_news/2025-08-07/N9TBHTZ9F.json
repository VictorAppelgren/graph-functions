  "description": "Why does the brain of some people stay sharp into their 80s and beyond? An expert explains what 25 years of exploring the brain tissue of \u201cSuperAgers\u201d has discovered.",
  "content": "The human brain shrinks as it ages, affecting the ability to remember \u2014 it\u2019s part of life. Yet there are a lucky few, called \u201cSuperAgers,\u201d who possess a brain that fights back. For these people, memories stay as sharp as they were 30 or more years in the past.\n\nCarol Siegler, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Palatine, is a SuperAger. At 82, she won the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament for her age group, which she said she entered \u201cas a gag.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve auditioned twice for \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 and did well enough on it to be invited to the live auditions. Then Covid hit,\u201d Siegler told me in 2022, when she was 85.\n\nToday, Siegler is still going strong, well on her way to her 90th birthday, said Tamar Gefen, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Mesulam Institute for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease at Northwestern University in Chicago.\n\nGefen conducts research at Northwestern\u2019s SuperAging Program, which is currently studying 113 SuperAgers. Over the past 25 years, however, 80 SuperAgers have donated their brain tissue to the program, which has led to some fascinating discoveries.\n\nCNN spoke to Gefen about those decades of work. She is a coauthor of a new analysis of the research that was published Thursday in Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia, the journal of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nCNN: How do you define a SuperAger, and what have you found out about their behavior over the years?\n\nTamar Gefen: To be a SuperAger in our program at Northwestern, a person must be over 80 and undergo extensive cognitive testing. Acceptance in the study only occurs if the person\u2019s episodic memory \u2014 the ability to recall everyday events and past personal history \u2014 is as good or better than cognitively normal people in their 50s and 60s.\n\nWe have screened close to 2,000 individuals who think they may be a SuperAger and less than 10% meet the criteria. Over the past 25 years, we have studied about 300 SuperAgers \u2014 a number of whom have donated their brain for research.\n\nOne key trait of SuperAgers is that they seem to be highly social people. They value connection and are often active in their communities. This is interesting because we know isolation is a risk factor for developing dementia, and so staying socially active is a known protective feature.\n\nAnother common thread in all SuperAgers is a sense of autonomy, freedom and independence. They\u2019re making decisions and living their lives the way that they want to live.\n\nI feel very strongly that successful aging is not just about sociability. If a person feels trapped, tethered or burdened, especially in a vulnerable state like poor health or older age, I think it can encroach on their entire psychosocial being.\n\nBut as far as healthy behaviors, SuperAgers run the gamut. We have SuperAgers with heart disease, diabetes, who aren\u2019t physically active, who don\u2019t eat any better than their similar age peers.\n\nThere is one SuperAger who drinks four beers every night. He laughs and says, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s done me wrong, but I\u2019ll never know.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have an identical twin to compare his behavior to, so would he have lived to 108 instead of 98? We don\u2019t know.\n\nCNN: Many of your most intriguing discoveries have come from studying donor brain tissue. What have you discovered about the memory center of the SuperAger brain?\n\nGefen: Our studies have shown that an area of the brain that is responsible for attention, motivation, and cognitive engagement \u2014 known as the cingulate cortex \u2014 is thicker in SuperAgers, even compared with those of people in their 50s and 60s.\n\nIn the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain, we found SuperAgers have three times fewer tau tangles when compared to their \u201cnormal\u201d peers. Abnormal formations of tau proteins are one of the key signs of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, tau also targets the neurons of the primary neurons of the cholinergic system \u2014 which is responsible for sustaining our attention in daily life. But that doesn\u2019t happen in the brain of a SuperAger. Therefore, the cholinergic system appears to be stronger, and likely more plastic and flexible for reasons that we\u2019re not sure about.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting, because I see SuperAgers as focused. They can pay close attention, engage and actively listen. How else could they recall 13 out of 15 random words after 30 minutes? I picture them engraving the words on their cortex with a chisel.\n\nSuperAger brains also have bigger, healthier cells in the entorhinal cortex, an area essential for memory and learning, that has direct connections to the hippocampus. The entorhinal cortex, by the way, is one of the first areas of the brain to get hit by Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nIn another study we examined every layer of cells within the entorhinal cortex of SuperAgers, and we painstakingly measured the size of the neurons. We found that in layer two, which is the layer that is most important for information transmission, SuperAgers had humongous, plump, intact, beautiful, gigantic entorhinal cortex neurons.\n\nIt was an incredible finding, because their entorhinal neurons were even larger than those in individuals who are much younger, some even in their 30s. That told us there is a structural integrity component at play \u2014 like the architecture, the bones, the skeleton of the neuron itself is sturdier.\n\nWe\u2019re expanding the studies of these neurons to understand their biochemical signatures, determine what makes them special, and see if these signatures are found in other types of neurons in the brain of SuperAgers. Are these same neurons particularly vulnerable in those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and if so, how and why?\n\nCNN: What have you learned from your research about how the brain of a SuperAger reacts to injury, disease and stress?\n\nGefen: We\u2019re looking at the inflammatory system in the brain of SuperAgers, with the goal of understanding how the immune cells in their brain respond to disease and adapt to stress. Inflammation, once it crosses a certain threshold, is a major component of cell loss in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and nearly all other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nCompared with the brain of same-age peers, SuperAgers have fewer activated microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, in their white matter. White matter is the brain\u2019s super highway, transporting information from one part of the brain to another.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Microglia are activated because there is some kind of antigen or disease, typically something destructive in the brain. In some cases, however, microglia and other immune cells become hyperactive and go into overdrive, thus causing inflammation and possible damage.\n\nThe brain of a SuperAger, however, has fewer activated microglia. In fact, the levels of microglia were on par with people in their 30s, 40s and 50s. That could mean there is less junk or disease in the brain of a SuperAger so the microglia have no need to be active. Or it could mean microglia are responding efficiently to in clearing out disease or toxins, and because they are more plastic and adaptable, the microglia are able to activate, respond and then calm down.\n\nAll of this is fascinating \u2014 it may be that at the cellular level, the immune system of a SuperAger brain could be stronger or more adaptive, much like the layers of cells we found in the entorhinal cortex.\n\nCNN: Whether or not you were born with the right genes to protect your brain sounds like the luck of the draw. What does that mean for the future?\n\nGefen: Genetics are tricky. It\u2019s not just whether you have a gene or not, it about how your internal and external environment works together to influence how a gene is \u201cturned on,\u201d or expressed \u2014 some may be more highly expressed, some will have lower expression. This is the epigenetic part of the puzzle.\n\nThere is a list of candidate genes that we are starting to study very carefully, these are genes that also have a role in aspects of longevity, senescence, cell repair and cognitive reserve to name a few.\n\nI\u2019m excited about that, not only for the genetics that are heritable from parents, but also genetics at the cell level, that enable each neuron or immune cell to carry out its respective job within the brain. With the technology that\u2019s advancing so rapidly, I\u2019m certain we\u2019re going to get to a point where prevention or modification at the genetic level will be part of the playbook.\n\nClearly, there is not a one target resolution for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I know we all want that one easy fix but it\u2019s just simply not going to happen.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take many teams and many specialists to come together and create a kind of personalized cocktail for prevention or treatment. I think it\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s going to take time.",

      "text": "In the largest observational study to date on \u201cSuperAgers\u201d \u2014 people in their 80s who have brains as sharp as those 30 years younger \u2014 researchers in Spain found key differences in lifestyle that may contribute to these older adults\u2019 razor-sharp minds.\nSuperAgers in the study had more gray matter in parts of the brain related to movement, and they scored higher on agility, balance and mobility tests than typical older adults \u2014 even though the physical activity levels of the two groups were the same.\n\u201cThough superagers report similar activity levels to typical older people, it\u2019s possible they do more physically demanding activities like gardening or stair climbing,\u201d said senior author Bryan Strange, director of the Laboratory for Clinical Neuroscience at the Technical University of Madrid, in a statement.\n\u201cFrom lower blood pressure and obesity levels to increased blood flow to the brain, there are many direct and indirect benefits of being physically active that may contribute to improved cognitive abilities in old age.\u201d\nThe study, published Thursday in The Lancet Healthy Longevity journal, followed 64 SuperAgers and 55 cognitively normal older adults who were part of the Vallecas Project, a long-term research project on Alzheimer\u2019s in Madrid.\nIn a battery of tests, the Spanish SuperAgers scored lower than typical older adults in levels of depression and anxiety, the study found. Mental health issues such as depression are known risk factors for developing dementia.\nSuperAgers also told researchers they had been more active in midlife, had been happy with the amount of sleep they got, and were independent in their daily living. Poor sleep is a key risk factor for cognitive decline.\n\u201cThis study adds to what we already know \u2014 SuperAging isn\u2019t just the ability to perform well on a cognitive test,\u201d said Angela Roberts, an assistant joint professor of communication and computer science at Western University in London, Ontario, in an email. She was not involved in the study.\n\u201cIt is associated with slower and less pronounced brain atrophy in regions critical for memory and language and possibly slower age-related declines in walking and mobility,\u201d said Roberts, also a principal investigator of the Northwestern SuperAging Research Program, a clinical trial led by the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\nThe study is good news for people in their 30s and 40s who may want to improve their health by incorporating more exercise, stress reduction and other healthy habits, said Dr. Jo Robertson, national screening and trials coordinator for the Australian Dementia Network at the University of Melbourne, in an email.\n\u201cThe take-home point here for people in midlife is that they need to be enthusiastically modifying lifestyle factors known to have an impact \u2014 increasing physical fitness, reducing cardiovascular risk, optimizing mental health and getting appropriate care for any mood disorders \u2014 to improve their long-term brain health,\u201d said Robertson, who also was not involved in the study.\nWhat is a SuperAger?\nMost people\u2019s brains shrink as they grow older. In SuperAgers, however, studies have shown the cortex, responsible for thinking, decision-making and memory, remains much thicker and shrinks more slowly than those in their 50s and 60s.\nTo be a SuperAger, a term the Northwestern SuperAging program coined, a person must be over 80 and undergo extensive cognitive testing. Acceptance in the study occurs if the person\u2019s memory is as good or better than cognitively normal people in their 50s and 60s \u2014 only 10% of people who apply qualify.\n\u201cSuperAgers are required to have outstanding episodic memory \u2014 the ability to recall everyday events and past personal experiences \u2014 but then SuperAgers just need to have at least average performance on the other cognitive tests,\u201d cognitive neuroscientist Emily Rogalski, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Feinberg School, told CNN in an earlier interview.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to point out when we compare the SuperAgers to the average agers, they have similar levels of IQ, so the differences we\u2019re seeing are not just due to intelligence,\u201d said Rogalski, who developed the SuperAging project.\nSuperAgers share similar traits, say experts who study them. They tend to be positive. They challenge their brain every day, reading or learning something new. Many continue to work into their 80s.\nSuperAgers are also social butterflies, surrounded by family and friends, and can often be found volunteering in the community. And as the current study found, they also stay active physically.\nMore gray matter in certain parts of the brain\nAll participants in the Spanish research underwent brain scans, blood tests and other lifestyle and cognitive assessments when they entered the study and were reexamined annually for four years.\nBrain scans showed SuperAgers had greater gray matter volume than typical older adults in areas of the brain responsible for cognitive functioning, spatial memory and overall memory. In addition, some of the most impressive changes in gray matter volume were in areas of the brain connected to motor activity or movement as well as memory.\nInterestingly, the study found SuperAgers were just as likely to have the same levels of APOE genes \u2014 including APOE4, a red flag risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 as normally aging adults. However, that finding is not new, experts say.\n\u201cSuperAgers perform better on a range of measures \u2014 memory, physical condition, speed and mental health \u2014 regardless of the levels of blood biomarkers of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Robertson, who is a senior clinical neuropsychologist at Melbourne Health in Australia.\nEarlier research has found a genetic predisposition for the ability to keep the mind sharp well into old age. Examination of donated brains of SuperAgers have found bigger, healthier cells in the entorhinal cortex \u2013 one of the first areas of the brain affected by Alzheimer\u2019s.\nBrains of SuperAgers also had many more von Economo neurons, a rare type of brain cell thought to allow rapid communication across the brain. So far, the corkscrew-like von Economo neuron has only been found in humans, great apes, elephants, whales, dolphins and songbirds.\n\u201cThe story here is not simply that (SuperAgers) are at lower risk of developing dementia,\u201d Roberts said. Instead, she said, they may have added protective factors \u2014 genetic or lifestyle or even a positive emotional outlook \u2014 that help protect them in the face of these risk factors.\n\u201cThis is a key reason to study SuperAgers \u2014 as they may help us to uncover protective mechanisms that act on known dementia risk factors \u2026 to lessen or minimize the risk of age-related cognitive decline and brain changes,\u201d Roberts said."

      "text": "As her memory faded from Alzheimer\u2019s disease in her late 50s, Tammy Maida began to lose track of her life. Car keys, eyeglasses and her purse disappeared multiple times a day. Key characters in novels she was reading were forgotten. Groceries were left in the garage. Keeping the books for the family\u2019s businesses became impossible.\n\u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d Maida told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the 2024 CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d\nAfter 20 weeks in a randomized clinical trial designed to drastically change her diet, exercise, stress levels and social interactions, Maida\u2019s cognition improved. She was able to read and recall novels and correctly balance spreadsheets again. A blood test even found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating in her brain, according to the study published in June 2024.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming back. It was really good \u2014 like I was prior to the disease being diagnosed,\u201d Maida, now 68, told a researcher on the study. \u201cAn older but better version of me.\u201d\nMaida\u2019s cognition showed additional improvement, however, after she completed a total of 40 weeks of intensive lifestyle changes, said principal investigator Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program.\nOrnish gave a study update on Tuesday at the 2025 Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in Toronto.\nWhile not everyone in the 26-person interventional group benefited, some did improve in three of four standardized tests, he said. In fact, 46% showed improvement in one test that measured changes in memory, judgment and problem-solving as well as the ability to function at home, practice hobbies and practice personal hygiene.\n\u201cAn additional 37.5% of people showed no decline in cognition during those 40 weeks,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cThus, over 83% of patients improved or maintained their cognition during the five-month program.\u201d\nThe new findings mirrored those of other studies on lifestyle interventions, he said, including the recent US POINTER study, the largest clinical trial in the United States to test moderate lifestyle interventions over two years in people who are at risk but do not yet have Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\u201cOur study complements these findings by showing, for the first time, that more intensive lifestyle changes may often stop or even begin to reverse the decline in cognition in many of those who already have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and these improvements often continue over a longer period of time,\u201d Ornish told CNN.\nAnd unlike available medications for Alzheimer\u2019s, he added, lifestyle changes have no side effects, such as bleeding and swelling in the brain that may occur with the newest class of drugs.\nEmblemHealth, a New York-based insurance company, announced Tuesday that it will be the first health insurer to cover the Ornish lifestyle medicine program for patients who have early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019\nThe lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 which he calls \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support.\nThe US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, declared in 2010 that Ornish\u2019s program for reversing heart disease was an \u201cintensive cardiac rehabilitation\u201d and that it would be eligible for reimbursement under Medicare.\nAdditional research has shown the same four-part program can lower blood sugars and heart disease risk in patients with diabetes, reduce prostate cancer cell growth, improve depression and even lengthen telomeres, the protective caps of chromosomes that are worn away by aging.\nDuring the Ornish intervention, one group of people consumed a strict vegan diet, did daily aerobic exercise, practiced stress reduction and engaged in online support groups. The rest of the participants were in a control group and were asked to not make any changes in their daily habits.\nTherapists led hour-long group sessions three times a week in which participants were encouraged to share their feelings and ask for support. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good-quality sleep.\nSupplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group, including a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic, and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom.\nIn addition to online strength training led by a physical trainer, people in the intervention attended hour-long video classes on vegan nutrition hosted by a dietitian. Then, to ensure a vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both participants and their partners were delivered to their homes.\nComplex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. While calories were unrestricted, protein and total fat made up only some 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 far less than the typical protein intake by the average American, Ornish said.\nWorking harder pays off\nPeople in the intervention group who put the most effort into changing their lifestyle have the most improvement in their cognition, said Ornish, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It! How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d Ornish said.\nThe 25 people in the study\u2019s original 20-week control group \u2014 who did not receive the intervention \u2014 had shown further cognitive decline during the program. They were later allowed to join the intervention for 40 weeks and significantly improved their cognitive scores during that time, Ornish said.\nIt all makes sense, said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d Tanzi told CNN in 2024. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d\nAdditional blood testing may offer insights\nIn the 2024 study, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed a significant improvement in the original intervention group. A\u03b242/40 measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a key symptom of Alzheimer\u2019s.\nTests that measure amyloid in different ways, however, did not show improvement, Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who specializes in blood biomarkers told CNN at the time.\nThere was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d Schindler said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d\nOver the complete 40-week program, however, a number of people in the intervention group did continue to improve their A\u03b242/40 scores, according to the study update.\n\u201cChanges in amyloid \u2014 as measured as the plasma A\u03b242/40 ratio \u2014 occur before changes in tau markers such as p-tau 218, so this is not surprising after only 40 weeks,\u201d Ornish said.\nFor Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope.\n\u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said.\n\u201cOur new findings empower patients who have early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease with the knowledge that if they make and maintain these intensive lifestyle changes, there is a reasonably good chance that they may slow the progression of the disease and often even improve it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur study needs to be replicated with larger, more diverse groups of patients to make it more generalizable,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut the findings we reported today are giving many people new hope and new choices \u2014 and the only side effects are good ones.\u201d\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

      "text": "Editor\u2019s note: CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta and writer Sandee LaMotte are part of the study covered in this story and have written about their experiences.\nWhen Penny Ashford\u2019s father was diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease at age 62, she knew the devastating brain disorder might one day steal her memory. In her late 50s, her free-floating anxiety turned to outright panic when she began struggling to find words.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell a story. I couldn\u2019t get my words out,\u201d said Ashford, now 61. \u201cI remember sitting at a dinner party one time, and I couldn\u2019t finish my thoughts. It was the most unbelievable moment.\n\u201cI came home and sobbed and told my husband, \u2018Something is wrong with me. I can\u2019t talk,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was petrified.\u201d\nToday, after a complete revamp of her lifestyle and overall health, Ashford\u2019s struggles with retrieving words have eased, while measures of amyloid and tau proteins and neuroinflammation \u2014 all hallmark signs of Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 have fallen.\nAshford knows about these improvements because she\u2019s part of a unique study tracking her progress via key blood biomarkers now being used to help diagnose early dementia. Instead of relying on painful spinal taps and expensive brain scans, these blood tests are heralded as a new, less invasive and time-consuming way to determine risk and aid in an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThe preliminary data, presented Monday at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in San Diego, analyzed biomarkers on 54 participants in an ongoing preventive neurology study called the Biorepository Study for Neurodegenerative Diseases, or BioRAND.\n\u201cThe field is primarily using various biomarkers to determine if you have dementia or not,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Kellyann Niotis, a preventive neurologist who researches risk reduction for Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\u201cNo one is really looking at the changes in these biomarkers as outcome measures, as a way of tracking progress in a person\u2019s journey to improve their brain,\u201d Niotis said. \u201cWe believe these biomarkers may show how the disease progression is being modified biologically by a person\u2019s actions.\u201d\nLess invasive test for Alzheimer\u2019s risk\nAlzheimer\u2019s blood tests are the key to widespread prevention of dementia, experts say. If people can be diagnosed in their doctor\u2019s office, they can more immediately move into preventive care and implement lifestyle changes designed to slow the progression of their disease.\nThe problem, said senior study author Dr. Richard Isaacson, is the variability in how well these new blood biomarker tests work to predict or track disease progression.\n\u201cThere is a dirty little secret in the Alzheimer\u2019s blood testing community where so many testing platforms, biotech companies, and a flurry of new blood tests are released,\u201d Isaacson said, \u201cbut it\u2019s unclear which of these tests are most accurate to track progression and evaluate response to therapies to slow progression toward dementia.\u201d\nTo address this gap, Isaacson\u2019s research team and collaborators at five sites across the United States and Canada set forth to evaluate and eventually cross-compare the clinical use of what the neurologist said he believes will one day become \u201cthe cholesterol test for the brain.\u201d\n\u201cIn the not so far future, people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond will get a baseline test to evaluate risk and help track progress over time \u2014 similar to how traditional cholesterol tests are used today,\u201d said Isaacson, founder of one of the first Alzheimer\u2019s prevention clinics in the United States.\n\u201cOur eventual goal is to offer a blood panel at cost to help democratize access and broaden the ability for people to receive care,\u201d he added.\nWhat Alzheimer\u2019s blood tests currently measure\nMeasuring levels of both amyloid and tau is key to understanding and diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia.\nAmyloid plaques play a key role in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s when small clusters gather at synapses in the brain and interfere with the nerve cells\u2019 ability to communicate. Such plaques are thought to trigger changes in tau proteins, which form into tangles in parts of the brain controlling memory.\nTau tangles are also implicated in other neurological diseases such as frontal lobe dementia, or FTD, and Lewy body dementia in which abnormal clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the brain\u2019s neurons.\nThe biomarker plasma phosphorylated tau 217, or p-tau217 for short, is a top contender in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Its cousin, p-tau 181, is also a helpful indicator.\nP-tau 217 is a \u201cbeautiful marker for Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, told CNN in an earlier interview.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really measuring amyloid, but the test is telling you it\u2019s there, and that\u2019s been backed up with objective PET (positron emission tomography) scans that can see amyloid in the brain,\u201d Carrillo said. \u201c\u2026 If you have elevated tau in your brain, however, then we know that\u2019s a sign of another type of dementia.\u201d\nAnother biomarker test is the amyloid 42/40 ratio scan, which measures two types of amyloid proteins, another key biomarker of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. At times, such tests work best when used together. In an earlier study, a combination of both amyloid and p-tau 217 tests, called the amyloid probability score, showed a 90% accuracy rate in determining whether memory loss is due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nGlial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, and neurofilament light chain, or NfL, which indicate brain inflammation and degenerative decay, are also helpful in tracking the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Dozens more biomarkers are being tested in labs around the world.\nIsaacson\u2019s team at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases is studying more than 125 individual markers from a variety of commercial and research-based tests, some of which may soon be available in a clinical setting.\nWhy investigate so many? Because personalized medicine may demand it, Niotis said.\n\u201cNeurodegenerative diseases present so differently in different people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be we will need a very nuanced, individualized approach in clinical practice to monitor the effectiveness of what we\u2019re doing for a given patient.\u201d\nHard work pays off in reduced risk\nThe ongoing preventive neurology study called BioRAND reported on 71 participants, with biomarkers being analyzed on 54 people. The other 17 people served as the control group.\nThe group of 54 received a series of personalized lifestyle recommendations designed to improve their brain. Such interventions have been shown in past research to improve memory and thinking skills by five points on a cognitive test for people with mild cognitive impairment.\nThe recommendations include a focus on blood pressure control, diet, exercise, stress reduction, sleep hygiene and weight control as well as addressing metabolic, hormonal and nutrient imbalances. Medications, vitamins and supplements are tailored to each person\u2019s unique needs.\nSimilar to a 2019 study led by Isaacson and Niotis, people who fulfilled at least 60% of the lifestyle recommendations were considered high compliance, while those who implemented less than 60% were low compliance. Periodic blood tests tracked progress in various brain biomarkers.\nThe outcome? The more work people put into change, the better their brains. Just look at Penny Ashford.\n\u201cMy blood work was terrible; my eating habits were terrible. I didn\u2019t exercise, so my muscle tone was really bad \u2014 I had no muscles in my bottom or on my thighs,\u201d Ashford said.\n\u201cI got the lecture of a lifetime,\u201d she said. \u201cThey told me, \u2018Your window is closing, your markers are so bad. Either you\u2019ve got to do this, or you\u2019re done.\u2019\u201d\n\u2018A 10 out of 10\u2019 on diet and exercise\nA lifelong sugar addict, Ashford stopped eating sweets.\n\u201cI used to think I had a chemical imbalance because I was such a crazy freak about sugar \u2014 I could polish off a whole bag of Oreos, no problem, and I love ice cream,\u201d Ashford said.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had a dessert. I haven\u2019t had ice cream. I haven\u2019t had anything except fruit since a year ago March.\u201d\nShe began an intense exercise program of cardio and resistance training, along with yoga for stress reduction, and moved to a plant-based Mediterranean style of eating. Under a doctor\u2019s supervision, she added supplements and vitamins to boost energy and lower stress.\n\u201cShe was a 10 out of 10 with her diet and exercise,\u201d Niotis said. \u201cShe lost around 30 pounds and gained lean muscle mass. It was amazing.\u201d\nA year later, Ashford\u2019s blood biomarkers told a completely different story about her brain health. Her p-tau 217 dropped by 43% and her p-tau 181 by 75%.\n\u201cWe also looked at GFAP and neurofilament light, the markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration,\u201d Niotis said. \u201cPenny\u2019s GFAP went down by 66% and her NfL went down by 84%.\n\u201cThese are really impressive changes in these markers of neuronal health,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the best part about it is it really did track with her clinical symptoms. Her word retrieval problems improved, and she felt so much better.\u201d\n\u2018I\u2019m so proud of myself\u2019\nAshford wasn\u2019t the only top performer in the study. Blood biomarkers also significantly improved across the entire group given risk reduction advice, Isaacson said, even those who were not as committed as Ashford.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost count on how many people have shown blood markers of brain disease trend in the right direction, but every time it amazes me,\u201d he said. \u201cFor over 20 years, I was told that what is happening right in front of my eyes was impossible, but the patients\u2019 stories, clinical improvements and test results speak for themselves.\u201d\nMuch more work remains before blood testing for Alzheimer\u2019s becomes a routine part of clinical practice, Isaacson said.\n\u201cOur group has a saying, \u2018Promise not to overpromise.\u2019 By this we mean it\u2019s critical to be transparent about the current limitations of these tests, and the variability across different platforms,\u201d he said.\nWhile science works out the kinks, Ashford counts herself lucky to be able to track changes in her biomarker numbers \u2014 a key motivator in her journey toward better brain health.\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge, huge,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of myself. And each success that I have empowers me to do more, keep going and not let up.\n\u201cI look back at my dad. He didn\u2019t have any of these options. I watched my dad deteriorate, and I thank God, I am so lucky. We are so lucky.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "SuperAgers are individuals over 80 who maintain cognitive abilities comparable to those in their 50s and 60s, exhibiting thicker brain cortices and fewer tau tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease. Research at Northwestern University has identified traits such as high sociability, autonomy, and active lifestyles as common among SuperAgers, contributing to their cognitive resilience. Recent studies suggest that lifestyle interventions, including diet and exercise, can significantly improve cognitive health and even reverse some symptoms of Alzheimer's in individuals already diagnosed with the disease.",
