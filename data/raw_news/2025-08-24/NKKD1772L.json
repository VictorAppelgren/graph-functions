These provisions affect your legal rights. Please read them carefully.\nTable of Contents\n1. SCOPE OF TERMS\nAcceptance. By accessing or using the Services, you agree that you have read, understood, and are legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Services. These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other policies incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and AP with respect to your use of the Services and supersede all prior or inconsistent understandings or agreements. Capitalized terms not defined in these Terms shall have the meanings set forth in our Privacy Policy or other incorporated policies.\nRight to Modify. We may modify, update, add to, or delete from these terms (together, \u201crevise\u201d) at any time in our sole discretion by posting the revised Terms on this page with an updated \u201cLast Updated\u201d date. We may also provide additional notice of material revisions, such as by email or on the Site. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions are posted, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. You are responsible for reviewing these Terms regularly to stay informed of any revisions.\nEffective Period. These Terms, including any revisions and incorporated documents, remain in effect while you use the Services. Certain provisions, by their nature, may continue in effect after you stop using the Services or after your Account is terminated (for example, license grants, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution procedures).\nDefinitions. For purposes of these Terms, \u201cuse\u201d of the Services includes any access to, interaction with, or communication through the Services, whether actual or attempted. \u201cUser\u201d means anyone who uses the Services in this way.\nNew Features. Any new features, components, or developments added to the Services are automatically subject to these Terms unless we provide notice that different terms apply. You must also comply with any additional terms that apply to third-party content, materials, software, or services accessible through the Services.\n2. USER ELIGIBILITY\nYou must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (often 18 years old by may vary) to use the Services. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction, and (b) you have the legal capacity and authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of yourself or, if applicable, the entity you represent. We reserve the right, at our sole and absolute discretion, to deny any user access to the Services, or any portion of the Services, without notice and without reason.\n3. ACCOUNT INFORMATION\nCertain features of our Services, such as participating in APNews Comments or saving preferences, may require you to register for an account with APNews (\u201cAccount\u201d).\nAccount Registration. You may be able to register using a third-party login provider (e.g., Facebook, Google), or you can create an Account directly with us. For the latter, you will be asked to provide a sign-in name (\u201cUsername\u201d), a password (\u201cPassword\u201d), and, in some cases, additional information to help us authenticate your identity in the future (\u201cUnique Identifiers\u201d). Together, your Username, Password, and Unique Identifiers are referred to as your \u201cAccount Information.\u201d When creating your Account, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information.

Acceptance of a username during automated registration does not mean it complies with our Username Requirements. We do not conduct manual review of usernames when you register for an account, but we may review them later and reserve the right to remove, modify, or replace any username that violates our Username Requirements, at our sole discretion and without prior notice.\nIf you participate in APNews Comments, your username may be reviewed automatically as part of our moderation process. Usernames that do not meet our requirements will be rejected. Comments community members may also flag usernames as potentially noncompliant. If your username is flagged and determined to be noncompliant, we may change it and notify you of the change. You may update your username in My Account, but any replacement must comply with our Username Requirements. Repeated violations may result in penalties, including suspension or termination of your Account.\nConfidentiality and Account Security. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account Information and for all activity that occurs through your Account, whether or not authorized by you. You must promptly notify us if you believe any of your Account Information has been compromised or if you need to deactivate your Account.\nWe reserve the right to change or delete your Username, Password, or Unique Identifier at any time and for any reason, without liability to you for any resulting loss or damage. We may accept or reject any account registration in our sole discretion, and we are under no obligation to maintain any Account. We will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any unauthorized use of your Account.\n4. USER CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS\nBy using the Services, you agree to comply with the following requirements (\u201cUser Conduct Requirements\u201d):\nWe reserve the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms and to involve, cooperate with, or provide information to law enforcement authorities in connection with any such violations.\n5.

DISCOVERY, AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents AP from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect AP\u2019s proprietary interests or intellectual property rights.\nBefore initiating arbitration or legal proceedings, you and AP agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve any Dispute. To begin this process, you must send a letter describing the nature of your claim and desired resolution to the address provided for Legal Matters in the Contact Us section of these Terms (see Section 20). You and we agree to meet and confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (\u201cConference\u201d) to discuss the Dispute and attempt in good faith to reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. Each party may be represented by counsel in this process. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the Conference by phone, video, or in person to attempt to resolve the Dispute. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the Conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled during this resolution period. If you and we do not reach agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after initiation of this dispute resolution process, either you or we may commence arbitration or, provided such claims qualify, file an action in small claims court or file a claim for injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction for matters relating to intellectual property infringement.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding after participating in the dispute resolution process, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at the address provided for Legal Matters in the Contact Us Section of these Terms (see Section 20). The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys\u2019 fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect. JAMS\u2019s rules are available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, we will pay them for you if you complied with the dispute resolution process set forth above. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous or you did not comply with the dispute resolution process set forth above, except that if you have initiated the arbitration claim, you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration claims initiated by you. You are still responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or videoconference, based on written submissions, in person in your hometown area (if you live in the United States), or at another mutually agreed upon location that is reasonably convenient to you. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.\nThe arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (b) resolve any Dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.\nYOU AND WE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section14.2. An arbitrator can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PAGA) OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party\u2019s claims without the written consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and we agree that no Dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration without the written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this subsection\u2019s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.\nIf any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\nNotwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to us at the address provided for Legal Matters in the \u201cContact Us\u201d section of these Terms (see Section 20).\n17. EQUITABLE RELIEF\nYou acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of our intellectual property rights, confidential information, and/or proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce these Terms. We may, without waiving any other remedies under these Terms or applicable law, or the Arbitration Agreement seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above (see Section 16). All claims or disputes arising out of, related to, in connection with, or resulting in any way from these Terms shall be heard exclusively by any of the federal or state courts of competent jurisdiction located in New York County in the State of New York, USA.\n18.

CONTROLLING LAW\nThese Terms and any action arising from, related to, or resulting in any way from these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of New York in the United States without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\n16. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPlease read the following arbitration agreement (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with us and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, including a class action waiver.\nYou agree that, in the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, related to, in connection with, or resulting in any way from your use of the Services, these Terms, the Content, or any aspect of your relationship with us (each, a \u201cDispute\u201d), such Dispute, including threshold questions of the arbitrability of such Dispute, will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d). NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY SUCH SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT\u2019S JURISDICTION. DISCOVERY, AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents AP from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect AP\u2019s proprietary interests or intellectual property rights.\nBefore initiating arbitration or legal proceedings, you and AP agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve any Dispute. To begin this process, you must send a letter describing the nature of your claim and desired resolution to the address provided for Legal Matters in the Contact Us section of these Terms (see Section 20). You and we agree to meet and confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (\u201cConference\u201d) to discuss the Dispute and attempt in good faith to reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. Each party may be represented by counsel in this process. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the Conference by phone, video, or in person to attempt to resolve the Dispute. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the Conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled during this resolution period. If you and we do not reach agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after initiation of this dispute resolution process, either you or we may commence arbitration or, provided such claims qualify, file an action in small claims court or file a claim for injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction for matters relating to intellectual property infringement.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding after participating in the dispute resolution process, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at the address provided for Legal Matters in the Contact Us Section of these Terms (see Section 20). The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys\u2019 fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect. JAMS\u2019s rules are available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, we will pay them for you if you complied with the dispute resolution process set forth above. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous or you did not comply with the dispute resolution process set forth above, except that if you have initiated the arbitration claim, you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration claims initiated by you. You are still responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or videoconference, based on written submissions, in person in your hometown area (if you live in the United States), or at another mutually agreed upon location that is reasonably convenient to you. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.\nThe arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (b) resolve any Dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.\nYOU AND WE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section14.2. An arbitrator can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PAGA) OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party\u2019s claims without the written consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and we agree that no Dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration without the written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this subsection\u2019s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.\nIf any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\nNotwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to us at the address provided for Legal Matters in the \u201cContact Us\u201d section of these Terms (see Section 20).\n17. EQUITABLE RELIEF\nYou acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of our intellectual property rights, confidential information, and/or proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce these Terms. We may, without waiving any other remedies under these Terms or applicable law, or the Arbitration Agreement seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above (see Section 16). All claims or disputes arising out of, related to, in connection with, or resulting in any way from these Terms shall be heard exclusively by any of the federal or state courts of competent jurisdiction located in New York County in the State of New York, USA.\n18. DOWNLOADING THE APP\nWe may make the App available through the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store (together, the \u201cApp Provider\u201d). The following terms apply to the App when accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store where the App may now or in the future be made available.

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, the remainder of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect. If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\n- Any amendment to or waiver of this Statement must be made in writing and signed by us. No waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.\n- You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our written consent. All our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.\n- Nothing in these Terms shall prevent us from complying with the law.\n- These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.\n- The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import.\n- If you have an account, any legal notice relating to these Terms shall be sent to the email address associated with your account, and you agree that this constitutes adequate and sufficient notice. Any legal notice to us shall be sent to the contact for legal matters (see Contact Us, Section 20, below).\n- These Terms will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.contact-us\nContent, Account Information, and General Matters.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically, as we may update it to reflect new privacy tools and user controls.\nThis section outlines the privacy choices you have depending on your location, the device you use, and how you interact with our Services.\nA. US Residents\nConsent: By using our Services, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

You may request that we maintain accurate Personal Information about you and correct any inaccuracies in Personal Information that we have collected from you, subject to exceptions within the law.\n- How to make your request:\n- Submit a request through our web form available here.\n- We may verify your identity before fulfilling the request.\n- Once you have verified your identity, we will comply with your request unless a legal exemption applies.\niv.

Processing Requests. Once your request is submitted, we will contact you with instructions for how to verify the request. We strive to complete verified requests as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with relevant law. Please note that it may take additional time to verify and fulfill agent-submitted requests. Also note that many of the above requests are subject to exceptions and limitations.\nvi. Non-Discrimination. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights or choices contained in this Privacy Policy.\nStates without Active Privacy Laws: If you reside in a state that does not currently have an active comprehensive privacy law, you may not be able to make these privacy choices at this time. As state and federal laws change, we will be updating our privacy program.\nB. Residents Outside the US\nConsent and Tracking Technologies.

We rely on digital advertising to help fund our ability to provide you with fast, accurate, and unbiased news at no cost to you. We respect your choice to limit the ads you see, and we want to make you aware of how adblockers and related technologies may interact with our Services.\n- An adblocker is a browser extension, app, or built-in feature that blocks advertisements from displaying. Adblockers may improve browsing speed and reduce clutter, but they may also impact the advertising revenue that supports free content like ours. If you use an adblocker, note that it may allow certain ads that meet specific criteria (such as \u201cacceptable ads\u201d), which may include some of the ads we serve. You can manage these settings by adjusting your adblocker\u2019s preferences. For more information, visit the Acceptable Ads website.\n- To support our ad-funded model, we may use an ad blocking recovery service\u2014a tool that detects adblocker use and helps us respond appropriately. These services may allow permitted ads to be displayed or prompt users to disable their adblocker in order to continue accessing content. We aim to balance our need to support high-quality journalism through advertising with our users\u2019 desire for control over their browsing experience.\nCCPA: The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) provides California residents with the rights to:\n- Access, correct, or delete your Personal Information:\n- You can make these requests through our Personal Information Access Request Form, available here.\n- Opt out of the sale of Personal Information and the sharing of Personal Information for cross-context behavior advertising (the following steps are the same as provided in Section 9.A):\n- You can opt out of the sharing of your name, email, and other associated Personal Information for targeted advertising through our Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information form available here.\n- You can opt out of our use of Tracking Technologies (other than those that are strictly necessary) through the \u201cYour Privacy Choices\u201d link in the footer or navigation menu in the upper left corner of the web site.\n- You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information or use for targeted advertising by using an opt-out preference signal, such as the GPC signal.
