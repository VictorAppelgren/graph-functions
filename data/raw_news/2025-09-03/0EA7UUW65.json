Precise differentiation between soft tissues and affected tissues, reduced patient exposure to eradicating radiations, increased prevalence of age related macular degeneration, increased GDP expenditure on healthcare among rapidly growing economies, increased need and adoption of non invasive tools for rapid scanning and identification of disorders coupled with increasing research to adopt these tools in the field of dentistry, gastroenterology, and gynecology are factors influencing the market growth and adoption of optical imaging systems. However, high costs of instruments, stringent regulatory approval procedures, a dearth of skilled operators, and insufficient reimbursements for optical imaging procedures are factors posing several challenges to the overall growth of the market during the forecast period.\nGlobal Optical imaging Trends\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study, Request for Free Sample Report\nOptical imaging Market Dynamics\nDRIVERS: Increasing prevalence of eye disorders due to the rising geriatric population\nThe growing prevalence of eye disorders, owing to the rising global geriatric population, is one of the key factors driving the growth of the global market. The tear layer loses stability and degrades faster in the elderly, making them more prone to eye disorders. Therefore, the risk of getting severe eye disorders increases significantly with age, particularly after 60 years. Currently, the prevalence rate of glaucoma is four times higher in individuals aged 80 years and above as compared to those aged 40 years and above. Also, the prevalence rates of several other eye disorders, such as cataract, presbyopia, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is increasing across the globe. For instance, according to Prevent Blindness (US), 24.41 million people were suffering from cataracts in the US in 2010; this number is expected to increase to 50.0 million by 2050.\nRESTRAINTS: Reimbursement challenges\nThe US is the largest market for optical imaging technologies. However, recent changes in reimbursement policies in the country are expected to affect the growth of this market. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the size of the insured population in the US has increased. However, this has also resulted in insufficient reimbursements for newly insured patients. Moreover, medical reimbursements for various optical imaging technologies are decided based on their use for intended applications.\nIn July 2020, the Centers for Medicare, and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented major changes in reimbursements for several vitreoretinal procedures. They implemented a 15% reimbursement cut for all cataract surgeries performed within the US. Thus, reimbursement changes pose a great barrier to the market growth.\nOPPORTUNITIES: Emerging economies\nEmerging countries such as India, China, Japan, and Brazil are expected to provide significant growth opportunities for players operating in the global market. These countries are some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. According to estimates from the World Economic Forum, 2020, these emerging economies contributed to around one-third of the global healthcare expenditure. The rise in geriatric population and diseases associated with it are also certain factors that create high growth opportunities for the market.\nCHALLENGES: Sustainability of small and medium-sized players\nIncreasing market competitiveness is one of the major challenges in the optical imaging systems market, especially for small and mid-tier companies. Although the global market is dominated by few players such as PerkinElmer, Inc., Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, and Abbott Laboratories, new entrants and mid-tier firms continuously strive to garner a greater market share and market visibility. However, higher costs and longer time required for the development of optical imaging products pose a major barrier for such companies.\nOptical Coherence Tomography segment accounted for the largest share in the optical imaging market by technique\nThe demand for better techniques and safer diagnostic procedures is rising as a result of changes in the medical technology sector. The demand for non-invasive diagnostic imaging modalities is driven by factors such as increasing elderly population, an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, and the need for safer diagnostic methods. This in turn fuels the market's expansion. OCT systems enables the visualisation of optically scattered, non transparent tissues, making it a useful tool for the diagnosis in various therapeutic areas.\nOphthalmology segment accounted for the largest share in the optical imaging market by therapeutic area\nThe market's overall growth for ophthalmology is likely to be driven by the growing number of ophthalmic procedures being performed every year across the globe. Nearly 3.7 million cataract procedures are performed in the US, 7 million in Europe and 20 million worldwide. With the increased awareness of optical instruments in the developing countries, the market provides great growth opportunity in these regions. Growing demand for low cost OCT systems is creating opportunities for the market to flourish in this region. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years and contribute to overall market growth. The increasing aging population, coupled with the rising prevalence of ophthalmic disorders, will play a vital role in the growth of the global market during the forecast period\nImaging systems segment accounted for the largest share in the optical imaging market by product\nThe imaging systems segment accounted for the largest share of the global market, by product in the forecast period. This segment's large share can be attributed to its wide application in ophthalmology, oncology, and other application. These systems are widely adopted as they provide real-time, 1D depth, 2D cross-sectional, and 3D volumetric images with micron-level resolution and imaging depths of up to a few millimeters with no hazardous radiation. Subsurface tissue details are hidden without OCT display in bright and sharp images, allowing for a better understanding of ocular pathology. In turn, this development helps surgeons overcome uncertainties during eye surgeries to achieve the best possible patient outcome.\nHospital segment accounted for the largest share in the optical imaging market by end user\nBased on end user, the market, by end user is led by the hospital and clinics segment Hospitals and clinics majorly adopt optical imaging technologies for ophthalmological diagnostic imaging and cancer screening procedures. These technologies are also used in cardiology, neurology, and dermatology, but to a lesser extent. This market's growth is mainly driven by the increasing clinical applications of optical imaging techniques in various therapeutic areas and the growing demand for optical imaging products by clinicians across the globe.\nGeographic Snapshot: Optical Imaging Market\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study, download the pdf brochure\nKey players in the optical imaging market include Carl Zeiss Meditec (Germany), Abbott (US), Topcon Corporation (Japan), Canon (Japan), PerkinElmer (US), Koninklijke Philips (Netherlands), Heidelberg Engineering (US), Leica Microsystems (Germany), Headwall Photonics (US), Visionix (US), Optical Imaging (Israel), Optos (Scotland), Wasatch Photonics (US), ArcScan (US), DermaLumics (Spain), Cylite (Australia), MOPTIM (Guangdong), Michelson Diagnostics (England), Thorlabs (US), Hamamatsu Photonics (Japan), iTheraMedical (Germany), Kibero (Germany), Seno Medical (US), Aspectus Imaging (Germany), and Agfa-Gevaert (Belgium).\nOptical Imaging Market Report Scope\n|\nReport Metric |\nDetails |\n|\nMarket Size available for years |\n2020-2027 |\n|\nBase Year Considered |\n2021 |\n|\nForecast period |\n2022-2027 |\n|\nForecast Unit |\nValue(USD Billion) |\n|\nSegments covered |\nProduct, Application, Therapeutic Area, Techniques and End User |\nThe research report categorizes the optical imaging market into the following segments & sub-segments:\nBy Product\n- Imaging Systems\n- Camera\n- Software\n- Lenses\n- Illuminating Systems\n- Other\nBy Application\n- Pathological Imaging\n- Intraoperative Imaging\nBy End User\n- Hospitals\n- Research Laboratories\n- Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Companies\nBy Therapeutic Area\n- Ophthalmology\n- Oncology\n- Cardiology\n- Dermatology\n- Neurology\n- Others\nBy Technique\n- Optical Coherence Tomography\n- Near infrared Spectroscopy\n- Hyperspectral Imaging\n- Photoacoustic Tomography\nBy Region\n-\nNorth America North America\n- US\n- Canada\n-\nEurope\n- Germany\n- UK\n- France\n- Spain\n- Italy\n- Rest of Europe\n-\nAsia Pacific\n- China\n- Japan\n- India\n- Australia\n- South Korea\n- Rest of Asia Pacific (RoAPAC)\n-\nLatin America\n- Brazil\n- Rest of Latin America\n- Middle East and Africa\nRecent Developments of Optical Imaging Market\n- In January 2023, Canon Medical Inc., partnered with ScImage.

      "text": "Top 10 Medical Device Technologies Market Size, Share & Trends by Type (In Vitro Diagnostics, Diagnostics Imaging, Orthopedic, Ophthalmology, Cardiology, Endoscopy, Diabetes Care, Respiratory Care & Anesthesia, Kidney/Dialysis Devices) and Region - Global Forecast to 2027\nUpdated on : Aug 28, 2024\nTop 10 Medical Device Technologies Market Size, Share & Trends\nThe global Top 10 Medical Device Technologies market, valued at US$417.7 billion in 2021, stood at US$437.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to advance at a resilient CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027, culminating in a forecasted valuation of US$577.5 billion by the end of the period. This growth is driven by trends such as the shift from centralized to point-of-care testing, increasing chronic disease prevalence due to urbanization and lifestyle changes, and growing healthcare needs in emerging economies like India, China, and Brazil. Key market players include Abbott Laboratories, Roche Diagnostics, Philips, Siemens Healthineers, and Medtronic. However, challenges such as uncertainty in reimbursement, high costs of advanced technologies, and hospital budget cuts pose significant constraints. Opportunities exist in expanding markets and advancing technologies, though the market is also expected to face limitations due to regulatory hurdles and reimbursement issues. The Asia Pacific region is anticipated to experience the highest growth rate due to its rising geriatric population and increasing demand for advanced medical devices.\nTop 10 Medical Device Technologies Market Trends\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study, Request for Free Sample Report\nTop 10 Medical Device Technologies Market Dynamics\nDriver: Gradual shift from centralized testing to point-of-care testing\nThe dominant model of laboratory testing throughout the world remains the centralized laboratory that uses automated analytical testing methods to detect target analytes. This trend is well established in clinical chemistry and hematology disciplines and extends to other areas, including immunoassays and molecular diagnostics.\nPoint-of-care devices offer advantages over conventional diagnostic procedures in affordability and ease of use and yield rapid results required for initiating decision-making. The increased adoption of POCT devices is greatly influenced by the need to make healthcare more patient-centered by organizing healthcare services around the patient than the provider. Centralized testing does not represent a convenient process for many patients because the testing process is often disconnected from the consultation. This happens particularly to those patients with a chronic disease such as diabetes who require regular monitoring, including frequent blood tests. The growth in self-monitoring of blood glucose, the largest portion of POC testing, is partly a testament to this need for more convenient and effective care.\nThe volume of testing performed outside the conventional laboratory is likely to increase in the coming years, driven by the need to deliver care closer to the patient. The menu of tests performed using POC testing devices has expanded considerably in the last two decades. This development was majorly driven by well-established technologies such as lateral flow strips, immunosensors, and the continual miniaturization of electronics & increased computing power of devices.\nHowever, while estimates of the growth potential for POC testing are positive, POC devices may be vulnerable to budgetary pressures. The burden is on the manufacturer to provide evidence of improved outcomes, but these outcomes can only be achieved through an improved care pathway. Despite having robust device design, inflexibility in the patient care pathway or poor understanding by diagnostics manufacturers may limit the adoption of POC devices.\nRestraint: Uncertainty in reimbursement\nThe unfavorable reimbursement scenario in most countries across the globe is a major factor restraining the growth of the medical devices market.\nHealthcare providers\u2014particularly in developing countries such as India, Brazil, and Mexico\u2014have low financial resources to invest in costly, sophisticated technologies. Moreover, the staff should be trained in the efficient handling and maintenance of medical devices and accessories. Maintaining medical equipment is of vital importance as improperly reprocessed devices can lead to cross-contamination and potentially expose patients to infections. This can incur additional costs. All these factors add to the cost of diagnostic or surgical procedures. Owing to the high capital, training, and maintenance costs, diagnostic or surgical procedures are generally expensive. Also, in most Asian countries, there is limited or no reimbursement for diagnostic or surgical procedures from governments.\nCurrently, the healthcare system in developing countries faces many challenges due to rising healthcare costs, increasing incidence of chronic diseases, and the growing geriatric population (coupled with the growth in age-related disorders). To counter these challenges, governments in a number of countries are focusing on redesigning their healthcare reimbursement systems. In Asian countries, there is very limited or no reimbursement available (except in Japan). Thus, limited or decreasing reimbursement rates in developed countries and undefined reimbursement policies in emerging countries restrict the adoption of diagnostic or surgical procedures globally.\nOpportunity: Growth potential of emerging economies\nIndia, China, and Brazil are relatively untapped markets for interventional cardiology. The high incidence of diabetes and the large geriatric population in these and other emerging countries offer significant growth opportunities for the interventional cardiology devices market.\nAccording to the IDF, ~77.0 million people suffered from diabetes in India alone in 2019; this is projected to reach 101.0 million by 2030. Similarly, in China, the population suffering from diabetes is projected to reach 140.5 million by 2030, from 116.4 million in 2019. In addition, increasing health awareness in the aforementioned countries is expected to increase the demand for advanced treatment methods, including interventional cardiology.\nChallenge: Hospital budget cuts\nIn response to increasing government pressure for reducing Several healthcare providers have allied themselves with group purchasing organisations (GPOs), integrated health networks (IHNs), and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) in response to growing government pressure to lower healthcare costs. In order to negotiate a fair price with the suppliers and manufacturers of medical devices, these organisations pool the purchasing power of their members. For large purchases of diagnostic imagingequipment, GPOs, IHNs, and IDNs are highly negotiable.\nHospital budgets have been drastically reduced as a result of rising prescription drug prices and a sharp decrease in the US's proposed budgetary allotment for health and human services as of 2022. According to an American Hospital Association study, federal payment reductions to hospitals will total USD 218 billion by 2028, forcing them to set aside smaller budgets every year.\nIn 2020, Nigeria decided to cut its healthcare spending by 40%. Owing to these budget cuts, most hospitals cannot afford costly imaging devices and prefer lower-priced alternatives, such as refurbished devices or upgrading existing devices. To address this challenge, market players adopt suitable strategies to meet the needs of these hospitals.\nTop 10 Medical Device Technologies MARKET ECOSYSTEM\nProminent companies in this market include well-established, financially stable manufacturers of Top 10 Medical Device Technologies.

The risk of developing diseases increases proportionately with age. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 80% of the elderly in the US suffer from at least one chronic condition. According to American Medical Association, by the year 2020 nearly 60% of individuals aged 65 and above in the US will be living with more than one chronic condition. The rapid growth in old-age population, the prevalence of age-associated diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, CVDs, cancer is expected to increase. According to GLOBOCAN 2020, about 18.1 million new cancer cases were estimated to be diagnosed globally in 2020.
