The platform directly addresses rising concerns over patient harm, physician burnout, and administrative waste caused by outdated PA systems \u2014 delivering real-time, AI-powered approvals and built-in compliance.\n\nTAMPA, Fla., Aug. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Anyone who has experienced delays in care due to the burdensome prior authorization (PA) process from insurers will find relief in EasyPA. Founded by a team of experienced physicians and technologists, this innovative startup is tackling the inefficiencies of healthcare data exchange head-on. EasyPA has launched a fully developed, market-ready solution that streamlines the PA process\u2014well ahead of the deadlines set by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Interoperability and Prior Authorization Rule (CMS0057F), which aims to modernize and reform the U.S. healthcare system and rein in bloat that cost providers an estimated $528 million in 2019. (1)\n\nEasyPA was co-founded by three healthcare powerhouses: Dr. Paola Ballester, who is CEO and Medical Director of Utilization Management at a leading children's hospital recognized for evidence-based pediatric care and academic excellence; Alex Vega, a CTO and senior AI engineer with deep expertise in electronic health record integrations and HIPAA-compliant infrastructure; and Dr. Ralph Martello, CPO/COO, a board-certified pediatric hospitalist and expert in clinical workflow automation. Together, they designed an AI-powered prior authorization platform designed by doctors \u2014 for doctors.\n\n\"The PA process is not just an annoying inefficiency\u2014it's life-threatening,\" said Dr. Martello. \"We're watching patients suffer while providers chase outdated faxes and paperwork. We built EasyPA so they don't have to wait another two years for relief.\"\n\nAccording to the American Medical Association and Medical Society of the State of New York:\n\u2022 78% of patients abandon treatment altogether because of those delays;\n\u2022 89% of physicians report burnout from spending at least 12 hours a week managing the red tape of PAs.\n\nIn some cases, the delay isn't just costly, it's deadly. Denials and holdups have resulted in patient hospitalization, permanent harm, and even death.

We built EasyPA so they don't have to wait another two years for relief.\"",
