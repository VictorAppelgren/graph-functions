  "content": "For the first time as a Jet, Garrett Wilson was voted a captain by his teammates.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest sign of the young receiver emerging as a leader, after he signed a four-year contract extension in the offseason.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some accolades since I got in the league, but this is the one that I\u2019ll probably tell my kids about first,\u201d Wilson said Thursday. \u201cThat just comes from the last three years here. I\u2019m not the most outspoken guy, I\u2019m maybe not the blueprint of the leader when it comes to a captain. But to know the guys still appreciate the way I go about things and they respond to what I do say, it means the world.\u201d\n\nThe other Jets captains named were quarterback Justin Fields, defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, right guard Alijah Vera-Tucker, linebacker Jamien Sherwood, and special-teamer Marcelino McCrary-Ball.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some added responsibility,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut all responsibilities that I\u2019m willing to bear. I can\u2019t wait to go out there and just go do it. I think it looks different based on each individual. They didn\u2019t vote me as captain to act like someone I\u2019m not. So there\u2019s always balance in that.\u201d\n\nNew Jets defensive tackle Harrison Phillips has been impressed by Quinnen Williams, the backbone to the Gang Green defense.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an All-Pro,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThe Jets media department had a title sign out there, when you walk out onto the practice field, \u2018What player is going to surprise fans this year?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Quinnen Williams.\u2019 I know people think All-Pro is as high as you can get, but I think he\u2019s going to surprise people even surpassing that.\u201d\n\nCornerback Sauce Gardner (fibula) and quarterback Tyrod Taylor (knee) were upgraded from limited to full participants in practice on Thursday.",

      "text": "Garrett Wilson gets his Jets payday with historic $130 million deal\nThe new Jets regime made possibly their biggest statement yet.\nWith two homegrown players eager for contract extensions on their hands, they committed to one of them on Monday.\nThe Jets and Garrett Wilson agreed to a four-year, $130 million extension that includes $90 million guaranteed, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter first reported and a source confirmed to The Post.\nThe star receiver is now under contract through 2030 and is the first receiver in NFL history to receive an average over $31 million after playing only three seasons.\nWilson and Sauce Gardner are two foundational pieces on a team that is hoping to turn the page this upcoming season. There is no Aaron Rodgers to consider. There is no Robert Saleh nor Joe Douglas.\nGeneral manager Darren Mougey and head coach Aaron Glenn had several reasons to start fresh after another disappointing season for Gang Green. Yet, their willingness to keep one of the core players that they inherited speaks volumes.\nMougey wasn\u2019t a big spender in free agency. The Jets signed quarterback Justin Fields on a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million guaranteed, but not any other high-profile free agents.\nWilson, who is the first Jets first-round pick to be extended after a third season since the NFL\u2019s current financial system went into effect in 2011, has a $32.5 million average \u2014 which is the fifth-highest average for a wide receiver in the league. Only receivers Ja\u2019Marr Chase ($40.25 million), Justin Jefferson ($35M), CeeDee Lamb ($34M) and DK Metcalf ($33M) make more.\nWilson and Gardner are at the top of Mougey\u2019s to-do list, and extending the 2022 Offensive Player of the Year is his biggest financial decision yet.\nIn a way, there were signs in the spring that it would come to fruition.\nWilson, along with Gardner, notably were present around the Jets camp during the offseason, including for voluntary workouts. Both could have gone on to use their absence as leverage, as many athletes often do to further push for their desired contract.\nWilson showed at every voluntary workout in the spring and it was likely a sign that negotiations between the two parties were going well.\nWilson, who turns 25 on July 22, had another impressive season in 2024 in tallying 101 catches, 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, which all are career highs in his third year.\nSince arriving as the No. 10 overall draft pick in 2022, he has played in every game and has logged over 1,000 yards each season on passes from seven quarterbacks.\nGetting a deal done made sense for the Jets and Wilson, who expressed hope to stay in New York.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful I\u2019m a Jet for life and we get this thing rolling and that all of our best days are ahead of us,\u201d Wilson said in May. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what that looks like, but I\u2019m going to go do my part to make sure that it\u2019s undeniable when the time does come.\u201d\nYet, this interest wasn\u2019t always apparent as the 2024 season was drawing to a close.\nThe highly anticipated connection between him and Rodgers never quite found its spark. Additionally, the midseason arrival of the future Hall of Famer\u2019s former teammate in Green Bay, Davante Adams, didn\u2019t improve matters for Wilson as he saw less reps and was downgraded to the second option.\nThe Jets went 5-12 last year after Wilson endured 7-10 seasons in 2022 and 2023. It all led to visible frustration on the field.\nHowever, upon the arrival of Fields, who was his quarterback at Ohio State for two years, there is a new spark seen in Wilson.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get this opportunity on this level,\u201d Wilson said of playing with Fields. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m still taking it in all the way. It\u2019s cool. We\u2019ve definitely been picking up where we left off.\u201d"

      "text": "Take flight with the Jets\nText with Brian Costello all season as he brings Sports+ subscribers the latest Jets intel from on the field and off.\ntRY IT NOWHarrison Phillips achieved his goal during last season\u2019s trip to London by sacking Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers as a member of the Vikings.\nNow, the veteran defensive tackle\u2019s first game in Green and White will come against the former Jets quarterback when they open the 2025 season Sept. 7 against the Steelers at MetLife Stadium.\nPhillips, an eight-year NFL veteran who spent his first four seasons in the league in the AFC East with the Bills, practiced with the Jets on Monday for the first time since he was acquired from Minnesota last week with a 2027 seventh-round pick for two sixth-rounders.\n\u201cThe opportunity I have here, I think all you guys know that the arrow is pointing up here,\u201d the 29-year-old Phillips said at the team\u2019s facility in Florham Park. \u201cI\u2019m really hopeful that I can make sure the arrow continues to point up and I can do whatever I can to play that part.\u201d\nBy acquiring Phillips and Jowon Briggs (from the Browns) in separate trades last Wednesday, the Jets have shored up a position that already featured one of the best in the game, three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Quinnen Williams.\nThe team\u2019s porous preseason run defense should be fortified with the additions, especially Phillips, who also served as one of Minnesota\u2019s captains last season.\n\u201c[Vikings coach] Kevin O\u2019Connell, when he told me I was being traded, talked up what\u2019s happening here, and gave me a better understanding,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve kept up with AFC East news. \u2026 But I just know how much this city wants to win, I\u2019ve known that about Jets fans for a long time, playing against these guys twice a year.\n\u201cMan, you can just feel the optimism amongst the players and the staff with the new wave of people coming in here, so I\u2019m just really excited. Initial shock, but once I peeled back the onion, this is going to be a great opportunity \u2026 I would say this is a win-now mindset.\u201d\nPhillips did not have his most productive defensive season one year ago with 56 combined tackles and two sacks in 17 games, but the Vikings are picking up $3.7 million of the $7.4 million on the final year of his contract.\nThe upgrades also enabled the Jets to deal veteran defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi back to the Chiefs, where he spent the first seven seasons of his career before signing a one-year deal worth $1.42 million with the Jets in the offseason.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that we got a chance to go and get those guys,\u201d said first-year head coach Aaron Glenn, a former defensive coordinator with the Lions. \u201cThe first thing is they fit who we are: tough, physical, aggressive, resilient men that love football.\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ve been playing against Harrison for awhile, him being in Minnesota and me being in Detroit. And I\u2019ve said this before, he was a guy when he became a free agent that we were looking at when I was in Detroit as being one of our D-tackles, and obviously Minnesota paid him. But both of those men, they really fit.\u201d\nPhillips mutually has admired Glenn in recent seasons from across the field, saying, \u201cI believe he has the blueprints of how it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cI think what\u2019s really important is there\u2019s still a foundation of players already here that this isn\u2019t a rebuild. The foundation is set and it\u2019s what pieces we can add in a short time to go out and try to accomplish something big.\u201d\nThe 313-pound Briggs spent much of his rookie season on Cleveland\u2019s practice squad, appearing in only six games with 13 combined tackles (one for a loss) and one fumble recovery.\n\u201cNothing but excitement,\u201d said Briggs, a college teammate of Sauce Gardner\u2019s at Cincinnati. \u201cI feel there\u2019s a great defense over here and I plan to add my little bit of spice that I have and try to make a great thing even greater.\u201d"

EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.
