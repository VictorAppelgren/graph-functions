      "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, September 2, 2025: Good time of year to buy a house",
      "summary": "Mortgage rates are currently flat but have trended lower over the past month, with the 30‑year rate at 6.41% and the 15‑year at 5.55%.  The Fed’s recent rate cuts and the probability of a September 2025 cut suggest rates may stay steady, but a 10‑year Treasury yield rise could keep mortgage spreads high.  Homebuyers are advised to shop lenders early, consider rate buydowns, and weigh the timing of a purchase against expected price and rate movements, especially as the best buying window remains the late September to early October period.",
