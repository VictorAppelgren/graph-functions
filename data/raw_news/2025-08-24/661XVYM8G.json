  "content": "Aug 25 (Reuters) - While Yago Dora and Molly Picklum head into the WSL finals in Fiji as top seeds and favourites for their first world titles, plenty of surf fans will be rooting for Jordy Smith as he bids for a fairytale championship after 18 years on tour.\n\nThe powerful regular-footer from Durban was touted as surfing's next big thing as a teenager and joined the world tour as a 19-year-old in 2008, finishing second in 2010 and 2016.\n\nA two-time Olympian, Smith enjoyed his best year on tour in 2025, finishing with two event wins and earning the men's second seeding going into the one-day, winner-takes-all finals.\n\n\"Something has changed, truly, with Jordy this year,\" former pro surfer now commentator Mitchell Salazar told the WSL's \"The Lineup\" podcast. \"I'm loving it, I've always been a huge fan of Jordy Smith, now at 37 years of age.\n\n\"If there's one person that's on tour at the moment that's deserving to be called world champ, then it's this guy ... If he does it, it's a Cinderella story.\"\n\nRaised on South Africa's long right-hand point breaks, Smith has put in the time to master his backhand tube-riding.\n\nThat will prove essential at Fiji's Cloudbreak reef, especially against Brazilian goofy-footers Dora and 2019 world champion Italo Ferreira, who will ride facing the waves, and Australian Jack Robinson, the Paris silver medallist.\n\nWhile other reef breaks such as Teahupo'o in Tahiti and Pipeline in Hawaii might pack more punch in a concentrated area, Cloudbreak's vast playing field and long sections for barrels, turns and aerials make it a favourite wave of many top surfers.\n\nThe event can take place on any day between August 27 and September 4, with long-range forecasts pointing to better conditions in the latter part of the waiting period.\n\nThe format sees the fifth and fourth seeds facing off, with the winner to face the third seed and so on until the final challenger faces the top seed. In a change this year, the top seeds can seal the championship if they win their first heat, otherwise it will go to a best-of-three match-up.\n\nPicklum dominated the back-end of the women's regular season, with a second and two wins in the final three events, including a spectacular triumph in Tahiti , giving her the advantage as top seed.\n\nThe 22-year-old Australian's top rival in recent years has been California's Caitlin Simmers, who became surfing's youngest world champion last year at 18 and goes into this year's finals ranked third.\n\nWSL pundit Dave Prodan thought Picklum's performance this year at heavy waves, including a win at the Paris Olympic venue of Teahupo'o, would make her hard to beat at Cloudbreak.\n\n\"Her positioning in the line-up, where she sets up her waves, and the line that she locks in on her backhand at Teahupo'o is second-to-none,\" Prodan said.\n\n\"I was so impressed and everyone in the channel was just blown away and I think that bodes very, very well for her title campaign at the WSL Finals in Fiji.\"",

      "text": "While most 2024 Olympians will be battling for glory in Paris, the world's best surfers will be going for gold 16,000km away on Tahiti, where the spinning blue barrels of Teahupo'o might be the real star of the show.\nA potent mix of beauty and brutality, Teahupo\u2019o has been the venue for many of surfing\u2019s most exciting contests and some of the sport\u2019s seminal moments since it was revealed to the wider world in the 1990s.\nTeahupo'o, which loosely translates as \u201cPile of Heads\u201d or \u201cWall of Skulls\u201d after a gruesome local legend, was picked to stage the Olympic competition because the beaches in France are mostly flat this time of year.\nHuge winter storms in the South Pacific near New Zealand generate swells of up to 15m that travel thousands of kilometres before lurching out of the deep onto a shallow reef at \u201cThe End of the Road\u201d, as Teahupo\u2019o is also known.\nA map showing a string of islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, with the island of Tahiti at the far right and the town of Teahupo\u2019o on the southern edge of Tahiti.\nA large trench carved by fresh water running off the jungle-clad mountains provides an incredibly close and relatively safe spot for spectator boats.\nWhile the biggest waves rise some 10m and are not as tall as those in Portugal's Nazare or Hawaii's Peahi, the explosive power, giant tubes and sheer volume of water set Teahupo'o apart as a hydrodynamic freak of nature.\nWhile Italo Ferreira and Carissa Moore carved and spun their way to gold in the murky, typhoon-churned waves of Japan's Shidashita beach for surfing\u2019s debut at the Tokyo Olympics, Teahupo'o breaks perfectly over a coral reef and is renowned for its heavy, hollow tubes.\n\u201cIt's a totally different wave,\u201d said Lucca Mesinas, who represented Peru in Tokyo and has also qualified for Paris 2024.\nWaves change as they near land\nWaves travel across oceans easily and become surfable only when they near shore and crash. But the shape they take is in large part a reflection of the seafloor underneath.\nA graphic showing cross sections of three waves and how the seafloor helps to create the shape of the waves as they break.:end\n\u201cJapan was a beach break and a lot of wind. It was a really hard wave to surf. And Tahiti is just an amazing island with a perfect lefthander.\u201d\n\u201cIt usually is barrelling, so it's a super nice wave. It can be really big too, and it can be really strong.\u201d\n\u201cHosting the Olympics at Teahupo'o is the best spot they could ever pick just because it's such a good wave at that time of the year,\u201d said local Vahine Fierro, who won the world professional tour\u2019s Tahiti Pro in pumping waves in May.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe - you need to live it to feel what I am talking about. But paddling into a wave as hard as you can, not knowing if you\u2019re going to make the drop or not because it is so hollow, getting into this big blue tube that just feels like time is stopping, and then coming out with the spit of the wave in your back, into the boats that are right there - it\u2019s just indescribable and the best feeling in the world.\u201d\na series of photographs showing surfers at different aspects of the surfing process, the takeoff, being deep in the barrel, and wiping out.\nThe following properties are optional and can be deleted.\nThe Olympics surfing competition will take place at Teahupo\u2019o from July 27-August 5. The schedule includes potential lay-days for when conditions are unsuitable with poor winds or if the waves are too small \u2026 or too big. A total of 48 surfers (24 men and 24 women) from 21 countries will be competing, with traditional surfing powerhouses the United States, Australia and Brazil likely to be among the medals. Host nation France will also be a strong contender with two local Tahitians in their team of four.\nSources\nFrench Hydrographic Office (SHOM); Satellite image \u00a92024 Maxar Technologies, Surfing video courtesy World Surf League; Reuters reporting\nAll photos by\nThomas Bevilacqua / REUTERS\nAdditional development by\nSudev Kiyada\nEdited by\nJulia Wolfe and Tom Hogue"
