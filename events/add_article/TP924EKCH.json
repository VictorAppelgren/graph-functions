      "summary": "Circle Internet Group’s stock dropped 28.1% in August after its first public earnings report, which showed a $482 million net loss largely due to IPO‑related costs. The company’s revenue rose 53% YoY to $658 million, driven by interest on its USDC stablecoin reserves, but the loss eroded investor confidence. The decline began before the earnings release, reflecting the typical boom‑and‑bust pattern of high‑profile IPOs such as CoreWeave and Figma.",
