  "description": "The startup entered into receivership after selling its customer list to Turo.",
  "content": "Rental car startup Kyte has shut down nearly one year after slashing staff and exiting most of its cities in the United States. The company sold its customer list to Turo in July, and then turned right around and entered into a form of receivership in California, according to a notice that went out to Kyte creditors.\n\nKyte fell behind on some of its loans earlier this year, according to the notice. That caused the company\u2019s top lender to repossess and liquidate Kyte\u2019s vehicle fleet.\n\nKyte\u2019s board of directors \u201cpursued various capital solutions\u201d to keep the company alive, the notice states. But the company wasn\u2019t able to line up financing and the board voted to wind down Kyte.\n\nWhile Kyte passed its customer list to Turo, a number of users who had pre-booked trips before the shutdown have complained that they\u2019re stuck waiting on refunds for hundreds of dollars.\n\nSome who spoke to TechCrunch said they were able to get their credit card companies to perform a chargeback, while others have had no luck. Kyte CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch in a message that chargebacks may be the quickest way for customers to get that money back.\n\nFounded in 2019, Kyte provided on-demand rental cars that it also delivered directly to customers\u2019 homes. It controlled its own fleet of vehicles, making it a bit more like ZipCar and less like the peer-to-peer offerings of players like Turo. Kyte grew to 14 markets and raised more than $300 million in financing over its lifetime, and started billing itself as the \u201cbest competitor to Hertz.\u201d\n\nThe business started coming apart in 2024, Volk told TechCrunch last year. Kyte was struggling to generate free cash flow in markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Volk said his team explored selling the business, but decided to restructure and focus on reaching profit in the two biggest markets of San Francisco and New York City.\n\nKyte\u2019s not the only startup in this sector to run into trouble \u2014 especially in the United States. Getaround, another peer-to-peer vehicle rental service, shuttered its U.S. operations in February of this year to focus on its European business. TrueCar founder Scott Painter pivoted away from vehicle subscriptions in 2024 after struggling to build up a business called Autonomy.",

      "text": "Rental car startup Kyte, which bills itself as the \u201cbest alternative to Hertz,\u201d is pulling out of almost all of its major markets in the United States and has cut its workforce roughly in half in a bid to survive after exploring a sale earlier this year.\nThe company is shrinking its operations to focus only on San Francisco and New York City (including Jersey City) as it works to reach profitability in the next 18 months, CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch. Kyte has been exiting other major markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Seattle. It started telling customers in Los Angeles that it is suspending operations in that city after November 7, as Curbivore reported Thursday.\nVolk said Kyte recently cut between 40% and 50% of its workforce. The engineering, consumer, and growth product teams were among the most heavily affected, former employees told TechCrunch.\n\u201cIn a capital-constrained environment, where capital is super expensive, we have to focus on our strongest markets,\u201d Volk said. \u201cHard decisions had to be made in order to sustain the business here.\u201d Volk noted that New York and San Francisco are Kyte\u2019s biggest markets, accounting for about 70% of its revenue.\nKyte raised $9 million in 2021 and closed a $60 million Series B in 2022, all on the premise of being a flexible, easy-to-use rental car service that would go so far as to deliver the vehicle to your door. When announcing the Series B raise, the company said it wanted to be the world\u2019s \u201clargest operator of shared, electrified, and autonomous fleets.\u201d\nThe company rapidly expanded to more than a dozen markets in the U.S., and started borrowing heavily to finance the purchase of its vehicles. The company struck a $200 million debt financing deal in 2022 with Goldman Sachs and Ares Capital, and another $250 million agreement in March 2024 with Barclays and Waterfall Asset Management.\nOver the summer, though, Volk said it was becoming clear that the unit economics of Kyte\u2019s business did not currently work well enough to generate free cash flow in those markets. He said his team explored selling the business at one point but decided to restructure instead in favor of reaching profitability first.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThat was only going to be possible if Kyte narrowed its focus, he said, hence the restructuring. Volk also said that the company recently completed a new fundraise to capitalize the restructured business, but he said he was not ready to share how much.\nThe rental and subscription car service space has gone through hard times recently, especially for companies that leaned heavily into electrification.\nHertz said in 2021 that it was going to buy 100,000 Teslas to fill its rental fleet with electric cars, but the company wound up only purchasing around 35,000. It sold the majority of those earlier this year. Autonomy, a startup created by TrueCar founder Scott Painter, fell far short of its own goal to build a fleet of 23,000 EVs; earlier this year it announced a pivot to selling software services and data.\nDespite the claims Kyte made in 2022, Volk said his company never got too deep in the process of filling its fleet with EVs \u2014 something that may have allowed the company to attempt this restructuring at all. That \u201cwas very good, retrospectively, that we did not lose a bunch of capital here on residual values falling down,\u201d he said.\nThis story has been updated with additional context about revenue and cash flow in Kyte\u2019s markets."

      "text": "Getaround, a company that helps vehicle owners rent out their cars, trucks, and SUVs to other peers, is shutting down its U.S. operations one year after cutting 30% of its North American workforce as part of a restructuring. Its HyreCar business, which it acquired in 2023 for $9.45 million, is also closing.\nThe company said in a Wednesday regulatory filing and in an email sent to U.S. customers that it is now focused on its European business where it operates in six countries, including Norway, Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Austria.\nThe email, which TechCrunch has viewed, urged customers to return car rentals by the end of Wednesday to avoid any coverage gaps and said it is \u201cat risk of no longer being able to provide liability insurance coverage in the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t, you may be personally responsible for ensuring it has the required liability insurance coverage,\u201d the email reads. Getaround said its car protection program will no longer apply to any vehicle not returned by the end of the day, meaning customers would be responsible for any damages.\nGetaround, which was founded in 2009 in San Francisco and was a TechCrunch Startup Battlefield finalist in 2011, has had a roller-coaster history.\nThe company was a VC darling, raising more than $750 million from high-profile investors, including $300 million in a 2018 round led by SoftBank Vision Fund. Other Getaround investors have included Menlo Ventures, PeopleFund, Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus\u2019 Reinvent Capital, and VectoIQ partners Steve Girsky, Mary Chan, and Julia Steyn \u2014 to name a few.\nGetaround used that money to expand into other cities and eventually Europe with its $300 million acquisition of Drivy and Norwegian car rental company Nabobil, both in 2019.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Within months of going public, it received a delisting warning notice from the New York Stock Exchange. It also went through layoffs in 2023 and 2024.\n\u201cOrderly wind down\u201d\nThe board approved on February 7 an \u201corderly wind down\u201d of the car-sharing business in United States, which includes laying off all U.S. employees, according to its regulatory filing posted Wednesday. The majority of those workers will end their employment February 14, with a few remaining to help close the business.\nGetaround estimates that it will incur charges of between $1.5 million and $2 million in connection with the reduction in force.\nThis orderly wind down may seem chaotic to any customers who had existing or planned Getaround rentals. In an email to customers, Getaround said it would support rentals (including insurance coverage) until the end of Wednesday, leaving customers with little time to return vehicles. The company has also canceled any future U.S. rentals.\n\u201cWe are working closely with hosts and drivers to return vehicles as soon as possible,\u201d the email reads. \u201cAny outstanding claims or balances will be handled through the wind-down process.\u201d\nInterim CEO and COO AJ Lee, who will be stepping down from the position, said in a statement that it has \u201cbeen an incredibly difficult decision, one that was not made lightly and only after careful consideration of various strategic options.\u201d\nLee added that \u201cdespite significant improvements in overall profitability and extensive restructuring efforts, the Company has faced an ongoing lack of liquidity which has made U.S. operations no longer viable.\u201d"

      "text": "Serial entrepreneur Scott Painter\u2019s plan to build an all-electric vehicle subscription company called Autonomy has not worked out. So he\u2019s pivoting once again to what he calls the \u201chardest build\u201d of his career.\nWhile Autonomy will continue operating the small 1,000-car fleet it assembled over the last few years \u2014 far from the stated goal of 23,000 \u2014 Painter is spinning out a new company called Autonomy Data Services, or ADS, he tells TechCrunch in an exclusive interview.\nThat new company will provide a software platform and data to automakers who want to operate their own subscription services for electric, gas, new, or even used cars. Painter also says he\u2019s in talks with car dealers, fleet operators, and even companies that sell construction and farm equipment but might want to offer subscriptions. He says an early version of the service is already generating revenue.\nPainter says ADS is negotiating with multiple automakers, including three that have already run their own subscription service in the past. The company is partnering with Deloitte to run the service; ADS will get a revenue share as the software-as-a-service provider, while Deloitte will charge the automakers (or other customers) to customize the platform.\nIt\u2019s yet another turnaround for Painter, who has had a rocky few years. After stepping down as CEO of auto retailer TrueCar in 2015 (a company he founded in 2005), he created car leasing startup Fair, which received over $300 million from SoftBank. That ended poorly, with early investors accusing SoftBank of driving the company into the ground and Painter ultimately stepping down as chairman in 2021.\nHis latest pivot didn\u2019t come easy, either.\nTo make all this happen in the first place, Painter had to convince Autonomy\u2019s investors, some of whom were underwater after the subscription service never took off as promised.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\n\u201cOur lenders had what\u2019s called senior secured status; they could have killed the company and tried to liquidate the fleet\u201d to get some of their money back, he says. But he worked with them to convert $32 million worth of debt in Autonomy into equity in ADS.\nHe also says he had to \u201cpersonally dig deep,\u201d including selling a $6 million beach house on the Pacific Coast Highway, mortgaging another property, and \u201cselling a bunch of assets that I didn\u2019t want to sell.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been the hardest build I\u2019ve ever had as an entrepreneur,\u201d he says, describing the whole process as \u201chugging the cactus.\u201d\nA six-figure acquisition for data\nAutonomy was already struggling last year when Elon Musk\u2019s aggressive price-cutting destroyed the value of the small fleet, which was mostly Teslas. (Painter, who knows Musk personally, says he has tried \u201cto impress upon Elon how important it is to be more predictable about discounting\u201d to no avail.)\nThe problem this time around is that most every major automaker has already tried subscription services. And almost every single one of them walked away from the idea.\nPainter says that happened because automakers \u201cdid not have the fidelity yet, or the understanding of how subscriptions would work.\u201d Because all of those automaker subscription services were brand new, he says, they didn\u2019t understand how customers would behave. Would they subscribe for just a few months? Or a few years?\nWithout that information, Painter argues, it\u2019s really hard to figure out pricing, and so automakers charged a lot for their subscription services \u2013 something that scared away buyers.\nThat kind of information is one of the things he plans to offer with ADS. And it\u2019s not just coming from the Autonomy customers. Painter quietly bought up the assets of bankrupt used car marketplace Shift Technologies earlier this year for less than a million dollars. In the years leading up to its collapse, Shift had bought Painter\u2019s former car-leasing startup Fair, which itself had previously acquired Ford\u2019s subscription service Canvas \u2014 bringing the remnants of his former business back under his ownership \u2014 and Uber\u2019s leasing service Xchange.\nThe data from all of those companies can be used to predict \u201chow long people stay in cars based on their customer cohort, what their FICO score is, how much income they have, so on and so forth,\u201d Painter says. This is important not just because it offers certainty, but because the flexibility of subscription services is attractive to customers with lower credit scores.\nIn addition to the customer data, Painter says he got all the source code, patents, trademarks and compliance and legal \u201cwork product\u201d from those defunct businesses, which he says should make it very easy for ADS to get up and running with customers in new markets.\nIn all, he says he got more than a terabyte, jokingly calling it an \u201castonishing avalanche of s\u2014.\u201d\n\u201cMy IT guys were just like, what are you going to do with all this stuff? It just kept coming,\u201d he says. But, he points out, the companies that generated all this data \u201cspent almost a billion dollars collectively developing software\u201d that he now owns and is using at ADS.\n\u201cI mean, when [SoftBank CEO] Masayoshi Son finds out that I was able to buy all of the Fair IP and assets for less than a million dollars, it\u2019s just, I mean, it\u2019s gonna just kill him,\u201d he jokes.\nAnd while he\u2019s gathered $2.5 million to fund the effort, the work is not done. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything that we had to do to make [ADS] an investable business. Right now we\u2019re just looking for an equity partner that will come in for somewhere between $5 [million] and $8 million,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019ll give the company two years of runway to then continue to scale with Deloitte.\u201d"
