  "title": "Trump and Putin will meet in Alaska next week, Trump says",
  "description": "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are planning to meet in the United States, multiple sources tell CBS News.",
  "content": "President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are planning on meeting in Alaska, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Trump confirmed on Truth Social the meeting will take place in Alaska on Friday, August 15.\n\nOne senior White House official told CBS News the planning for next Friday's summit is still fluid, and that it is still possible that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could end up being involved in some way.\n\nThe White House said earlier this week that Mr. Trump is open to meeting with both Putin and Zelenskyy, but Mr. Trump suggested Friday he may start by just meeting with Putin, telling reporters he plans to \"start off with Russia.\" Mr. Trump also said he believes \"we have a shot at\" organizing a trilateral meeting with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.\n\nThe expected meeting comes as Mr. Trump presses Putin to strike a ceasefire deal with Ukraine. It would be the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and an American leader since former President Joe Biden met with his Russian counterpart in Switzerland in June 2021, eight months before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFriday, August 8, is the Trump-imposed deadline for Putin to either cut a ceasefire deal with Ukraine or face hefty sanctions targeting the Russian economy, including possible secondary sanctions on countries that do business with Russia. Mr. Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods earlier this week, in part because India buys oil from Russia.\n\nThe status of those additional sanctions is unclear.\n\nMr. Trump has grown frustrated with Putin in recent weeks, as Russia has continued to pummel Ukrainian cities with drone and missile attacks. Mr. Trump has described some of his recent phone calls with the Russian president as disappointing.\n\nThe Trump administration's tone has appeared to shift in recent days. Mr. Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow for hours on Wednesday, which the U.S. president described as \"very productive.\" The White House and the Kremlin later indicated they were open to a Putin-Trump summit.\n\nThe president told reporters Friday: \"President Putin, I believe, wants to see peace, and Zelenskyy wants to see peace.\"\n\nBut the actual terms of any possible peace deal remain unclear. Russia's military occupies large swaths of eastern Ukraine, including both territories that it has captured since 2022 and ones that it annexed in a lower-intensity conflict that began in 2014.\n\nRussian leadership has indicated in the past that it wants Ukraine to withdraw its own forces from much of the country's east \u2014 possibly including areas that Russia hasn't even captured \u2014 and to end its longstanding push to join NATO. Zelenskyy has pushed back on those demands.\n\nMr. Trump said Friday he expects \"some swapping of territories\" between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. president has blamed both Zelenskyy and Putin at various points for slow progress on a ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump publicly argued with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office earlier this year, and he claimed Zelenskyy was prolonging the conflict by refusing to cede the Crimean peninsula to Russia. The Trump administration has also paused military assistance to Ukraine at least twice, before restoring the aid shipments.",

      "text": "Zelenskyy's White House meeting ends in blowup with Trump and Vance over Ukraine's future\nThe signing of a key minerals agreement with Ukraine and a scheduled news conference Friday by President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were abruptly canceled and the Ukrainian leader's visit cut short after an Oval Office meeting that included Vice President JD Vance descended into insults and chaos.\nAfterward, the Ukrainians left the Oval Office to head to a \"separated room,\" while the U.S. team stayed in the Oval Office, a White House official said. While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.\nThe contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\"\nLater in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy.\n\"They are fortunate it is not off already,\" a senior U.S. official said to CBS News on the status of U.S. aid to Ukraine.\nThe meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.\nZelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration Putin violated the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which had been signed by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\"\n\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance.\nVance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.\n\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.\nZelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.\nVance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.\n\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.\nZelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"\n\"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.\nZelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.\n\"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\"\nMr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"\nZelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.\n\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\"\nMr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.\n\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\"\nZelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.\nAmid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire?\n\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"\nEarlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.\n\"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.\n\"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.\nA White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\"\nThe meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"\n\"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"\nZelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m.\nAfter his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\nZelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.\nAs Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.\n\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\"\nAdministration sources on next steps\nHigh-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.\nWhen Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.\nNo phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.\nZelenskyy will meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday, Starmer's office said, ahead of a wider summit of European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported.\nRegarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.\nThe sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.\nWhat to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit\nMr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nOne Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.\nIn a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"\nMr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.\n\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.\nMr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.\n\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"\nMr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.\n\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.\nTop Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.\nReferring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"\nThe president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.\n\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"\nBut after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.\n\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"\nEarlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.\n\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion."

      "text": "Trump set to announce initial deal to end conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia\nWashington \u2014 President Trump plans to announce a pact for peace between two former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan and Armenia, at the White House on Friday.\nAzerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, and Armenia's prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, will be at the White House for a \"Historic Peace Summit\" and a \"Peace Signing Ceremony,\" Mr. Trump wrote Thursday night on his social media platform.\n\"The United States will also sign Bilateral Agreements with both Countries to pursue Economic opportunities together, so we can fully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region,\" the president wrote.\nAliyev and Pashinyan will attend the events in the Oval Office and State Dining Room, sources familiar told CBS News.\nThe agreement, the first ever inked between the two heads of state, comes as U.S. officials seek to deepen ties with the two countries, with energy production and transit as key attractions.\nArmenia intends to announce U.S. development rights on a 43-kilometer transit corridor to be called the \"Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,\" which will help provide access to the West, two sources familiar told CBS News.\nU.S. officials have been working for months on an Armenia-Azerbaijan deal.\nThere have been a series of conflicts between the two neighbors over the past three decades, most recently in 2023, when Azerbaijan launched an offensive in a disputed region that caused tens of thousands of ethnic Armenians to flee. A ceasefire in September 2023 averted a wider war, and the countries concluded talks over a peace treaty in March. But talks aimed at cementing the deal have stalled in the months since, with negotiations in Abu Dhabi in July failing to lead to a breakthrough.\nSpecial envoy Steve Witkoff traveled to Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, in March. Aryeh Lightstone, former CEO of the Abraham Accords Peace Institute, has made multiple trips to the region as part of peace deal talks. The Trump administration has said an Azerbaijan peace deal with its neighbor is necessary before it can join the Abraham Accords, as part of a plan to expand that agreement beyond the Arab countries that signed up to it in 2020 when they recognized Israel.\nEntry into the accords isn't expected on Friday, sources said. Both Witkoff and Lightstone are expected to be at Friday's summit.\nAzerbaijan also borders Russia, and has the potential to send oil and gas into Ukraine without going through Russia. The peace pact will open routes for goods to travel to the West without crossing Russia \u2014 or Iran, sources said.\nMr. Trump has privately expressed interest in a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in brokering peace agreements, sources have said, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said it's \"well past time\" that he be awarded one.\n\"We stopped a lot of countries from war \u2014 India and Pakistan. We stopped a lot of countries,\" he said Sunday. \"You heard about Cambodia and Thailand. We got that one done. We got the Congo, which was going on for 31 years \u2014 Rwanda, that one's done. We stopped a lot of wars.\"\nA ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine is a central priority for the White House, as discussions continue for a possible summit between Mr. Trump and Vladimir Putin as soon as next week."

      "text": "What led up to Trump's tense meeting with Zelenskyy, according to White House advisers\nPresident Trump's advisers on Saturday morning were still uncertain how to salvage a mining deal with Ukraine, which had been intended as a key first step in a Trump strategy to eventually secure a ceasefire and peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.\nWhat began as a formal meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Friday \u2014 a confidence-building step in a path toward peace between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 devolved into a feud, with finger-pointing and accusations.\nThe president's closest advisers \u2014 stunned after the debacle in the Oval Office \u2014 huddled around the Cabinet Room's oblong table for lunch, sources familiar with the events told CBS News.\nVice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were joined by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as the group rehashed what had just transpired.\nThey shared disbelief over what one source characterized as Zelenskyy badgering the president. Another official said that, had Zelenskyy kept his disagreements behind closed doors, the blowup wouldn't have happened.\nDuring the contentious meeting, Mr. Trump and Vance took an aggressive and sometimes belittling tone with Zelenskyy after he expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement given that he had repeatedly violated ceasefire deals, including the Minsk agreements, leading up to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nIn the hours after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House at the behest of Rubio and Waltz \u2014 with a joint press conference scrapped \u2014 there was discussion about whether the Ukrainian leader should fire whoever may have advised him on Friday's strategy. CBS News has reached out to Ukrainian officials for comment.\nSome of the Trump team's frustration targeted Zelenskyy's chief adviser, Andriy Yermak, whom they believed had undermined negotiations in recent days. Others said they weren't so sure it was an adviser problem.\nIt wasn't the first time Zelenskyy had clashed with his American counterpart. President Biden once hung up on Zelenskyy because of the Ukrainian president's perceived combativeness, sources familiar with the call told CBS News. The friction was kept private and officials insist the dispute was over policy \u2014 not basic facts like which country had started the war.\nIn recent days, there were signs the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal might not come to fruition. Neither side had signed preliminary paperwork that typically precedes an economic agreement of this scale.\nOn Friday morning, Graham, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, Democratic Sens. Amy Klobochar of Minnesota, Mark Kelly of Arizona and others met privately with Zelenskyy at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C. They recommended that Zelenskyy avoid being contentious, say thank you and sign the deal without changes, according to people in the room.\nDespite Vance's assertion during the White House spat that Zelenskyy hadn't said \"thank you\" for U.S. support, Kelly maintained that the Ukrainian leader was thankful for U.S. support \u2014 and said so during the meeting with senators.\n\"He has this like habitual gratitude,\" Kelly told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"He was very thankful, and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee kicked the cameras out of the room before we started to talk. That's the way this should be handled, not what \u2014 not what Donald Trump did.\"\n\"He was cornered and he was bullied in the Oval Office,\" Kelly continued, adding, \"I think Donald Trump was trying to look tough. JD Vance was trying to look tough. The only winner in that exchange is Putin.\" Kelly called the White House eruption \"a dumpster fire of diplomacy.\"\nSome Trump advisers were nervous the deal might go south before the ceremonial signing, but felt confident by the time Mr. Trump greeted Zelenskyy. They viewed it as an economic security guarantee, a shared investment binding the U.S. and Ukraine for a generation, sources said.\nZelenskyy had appealed to the West for ceasefire and post-war security guarantees, which were not explicitly included in the minerals deal. In Kyiv last month, Treasury Secretary Bessent had described the agreement as the foundation for a larger peace deal, and an economic partnership that would provide once the conflict is over a 'long term security shield for all Ukrainians.' However, the deal itself was not a ceasefire or peace agreement. Bessent described it as a very strong signal to Russian leadership of American commitment.\nKyiv had hoped for security guarantees up front that would secure a pledge by the U.S. to help keep the long term peace and prevent Russia from invading again.\nThe White House expected to finalize a version of the deal Friday that was essentially the same as one Bessent presented to Kyiv in mid-February. One modification: a provision was removed that would have placed a $500 billion cap on the value of minerals Ukraine would provide. The change was made at Ukraine's request because Zelenskyy disliked the narrative that Ukraine owed a certain repayment for past aid, people familiar with the deal said.\n\"We were trying to make it reasonable for them,\" one Trump adviser said. Trump's team privately discussed how they liked the new version better because it meant a deal could be worth more than initially conceived.\nThe minerals deal was a concept Graham had circulated as an avenue to create a new, mutually beneficial relationship for the two countries. Zelenskyy had presented it to Mr. Trump, at Graham's urging, at a meeting at Trump Tower in September.\nBut on Friday, staff quietly removed the formal ceremonial set-up from the East Room \u2014 a conference table and two podiums, and two sets of binders with unsigned documents.\nZelenskyy on Saturday arrived in London to meet with sympathetic European allies. No plans had been made for Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to speak again.\nIn the meantime, America remains the most significant military and financial backer of Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. There is $3.85 billion in military equipment already designated for delivery to Ukraine, and it is not clear if Mr. Trump will still clear it for delivery.\n\"They are fortunate it's not off already,\" a senior U.S. official told CBS News.\nAs for any further pledges of U.S. support from the Republican-led Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson recently said there's no appetite for it."

      "text": "Zelenskyy pushes back on ceding Ukrainian land in potential peace deal ahead of London talks\nZelenskyy pushes back on ceding Ukrainian land in potential peace deal ahead of London talks\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday pushed back at the idea of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia as part of any potential peace agreement, a day before American, European and Ukrainian officials are set for high-level talks in London.\nDuring similar talks last week in Paris, U.S. officials presented a proposal that included allowing Russia to keep control of occupied Ukrainian territory as part of a deal, according to a European official familiar with the matter.\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the issue is expected to be on the agenda for discussion again this week as all parties focus on finding consensus on a credible approach for ending the war that the United States can convey to the Russians.\nBut amid media reports about the U.S. proposal, Zelenskyy said the idea of ceding territory \u2014 including Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula, seized by Russia more than a decade ago \u2014 is a nonstarter.\n\u201cThere is nothing to talk about \u2014 it is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\nWeighing the U.S. proposal\nSome European allies are at least somewhat wary of the American proposal. But there\u2019s also acknowledgment by some allies that Russia is firmly entrenched wholly or partially in five regions of Ukraine \u2014 Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\nIf the goal is to obtain a ceasefire immediately, \u201cit should be based on the line of contact as it is,\u201d said a senior French official. The official was not authorized to be publicly named and spoke on the condition of anonymity according to French presidential policy.\nStill, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and aspirations to strengthen ties with the rest of the continent are a top priority for the Europeans, the European official said.\nIt remains to be seen whether the latest diplomatic efforts can lead to an endgame after more than three years of war since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor.\nThe fighting continued Tuesday as Russian drones battered the port city of Odesa and glide bombs hit Zaporizhzhia, local authorities said, as the Kremlin again warned that negotiators are unlikely to obtain a swift breakthrough in peace talks.\nRubio won\u2019t be attending this week\u2019s talks\nRetired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy for Ukraine and Russia, will represent Washington in the discussions in London, the U.S. State Department said.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio won\u2019t attend because of a scheduling issue, spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said. Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were part of the U.S. delegation in Paris last week.\n\u201cThey want diplomacy to work,\u201d Bruce said of Trump and Rubio.\nTrump said last week that negotiations were \u201ccoming to a head\u201d and insisted that neither side is \u201cplaying\u201d him in his push to end the war. That came after Rubio suggested that the U.S. might soon back away from negotiations if they don\u2019t progress.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cautioned that \u201cthe settlement issue is so complex that it would be wrong to put some tight limits to it and try to set some short time frame for a settlement, a viable settlement \u2014 it would be a thankless task.\u201d\nZelenskyy lays out mandate of Ukrainian delegation\nZelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s delegation heading to the U.K. has a mandate to discuss only an unconditional or partial ceasefire with Russia.\n\u201cWe are also ready to commit that after a ceasefire, we\u2019re prepared to sit down for talks in any format,\u201d he told reporters.\nZelenskyy added that Ukraine would only believe Russia is serious about peace once it shows results.\nWitkoff expected to visit Russia again\nPutin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Witkoff was expected to visit Moscow again this week. Ushakov provided no further details.\nWestern analysts say Moscow is in no rush to conclude peace talks, because it has battlefield momentum and wants to capture more Ukrainian land.\nRussia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting by imposing far-reaching conditions.\nLatest attacks\nOdesa came under a \u201cmassive attack\u201d by Russian drones overnight, wounding at least three people, the head of the regional administration, Oleh Kiper, wrote on his Telegram page.\nA residential building in a densely populated urban area, civilian infrastructure and an educational facility were hit, he said.\nLater Tuesday, Russia hit the southern city of Zaporizhzhia with two aerial glide bombs \u2014 a retrofitted Soviet weapon that for months has been used to lay waste to eastern Ukraine.\nThe attack killed a 69-year-old woman and wounded 24 people, including four children, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov.\nUkraine ceasefire offer still stands\nZelenskyy said in a Telegram post that his earlier offer of a ceasefire covering civilian sites still stands.\n\u201cRussia needs to be seriously prepared to talk about this,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThere are no obstacles on the Ukrainian side, and there will be none.\u201d\nPeskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said there are no plans for talks on the proposal. He said Moscow is prepared to consider such a step, but noted that reaching an agreement could take time.\n\u201cWhile talking about civilian infrastructure, it\u2019s necessary to clearly define when such facilities can be a military target and when they can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a military meeting is held there, is it a civilian facility? It is. But is it a military target? Yes, it is. There are some nuances here that need to be discussed.\u201d\nRussia launches dozens of attack drones\nThe Ukrainian air force said Russia fired 54 Shahed and decoy drones at Ukraine overnight, marking a resumption of long-range attacks that have blasted civilian areas and sown terror.\nRussia has stepped up its use of Shahed drones, expanding its production of the weapon and refining its tactics, the International Institute for Strategic Studies said in a recent analysis.\nAfter Putin declared a unilateral ceasefire on Saturday, Ukraine said it was ready to reciprocate but said Russian attacks continued. Zelenskyy asserted that Russia violated the ceasefire more than 2,900 times.\nThe Associated Press was unable to verify whether a ceasefire was in place along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.\nMeanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine are preparing for the spring-summer military campaign, Ukrainian and Western officials say.\n___\nMadhani reported from Washington.

Okay?\" he said on the plane.\n\"And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,\" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could.\"\nThe U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia.\nMr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia.\n\"I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'\" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. \"And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"\nIt's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin \"wants peace.\"\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed\" in Putin over Moscow's continued bombing of Ukraine, narrowing Russia's timeframe for a deal from 50 days to 10 or 12.\n\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\""

      "text": "Trump criticises Zelensky as Ukraine refuses Russian control of Crimea\nUS President Donald Trump has accused Volodymyr Zelensky of harming peace negotiations, after the Ukrainian president said Kyiv would not recognise Russian control of Crimea.\nWriting on Truth Social, Trump claimed a deal to end the war was \"very close\", but that Zelensky's refusal to accept US terms \"will do nothing but prolong\" the conflict.\nEarlier, US Vice-President JD Vance laid out the US vision for a deal, saying it would \"freeze the territorial lines [...] close to where they are today\".\nUkraine has long said it will not give up Crimea, a southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.\nVance said the deal would mean Ukraine and Russia \"are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own\".\nThe administration has yet to publicly offer specifics about what geographic concessions would have to be made.\nWhen asked by reporters at the White House about whether the administration was looking to recognise Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, Trump said he just wanted to see the war end.\n\"I have no favourites. I don't want to have any favourites. I want to have a deal done,\" he said.\nRecognising Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea would not only be politically impossible for Zelensky to accept, it would also be contrary to post-war international legal norms that borders should not be changed by force.\nHe has consistently rejected the suggestion that his country give up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula.\n\"There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution,\" he said.\nOvernight, Ukraine reported a Russian missile and drone attack on several regions.\nIn the capital Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said two people were killed and 54 injured, including children and a pregnant woman. Drone wreckage triggered several fires, and a number of people were trapped under the rubble of a residential building, he said.\nIn Kharkiv, in the north-east, blasts were reported in the city.\nNine people were earlier killed and dozens more wounded in the eastern Ukrainian city of Marhanets when a Russian drone hit a bus carrying workers.\nThe back-and-forth comments from Trump and Zelensky are the latest chapter in an often fractious relationship.\nIn February, the pair clashed in a fiery meeting in the Oval Office.\n- ANALYSIS: US intensifying bid to end Ukraine war - but chances of success remain unclear\n- EXPLAINED: Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?\n- UKRAINE IN MAPS: Tracking the war with Russia\n- THE MONEY: How much has the US given to Ukraine?\nTrump said on Wednesday in the Oval Office that he found it easier to deal with Russia compared to Ukraine.\n\"I think Russia is ready,\" Trump said, noting he believed they were nearing a deal with the Kremlin but aren't there with Ukraine. \"I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelensky. So far, it's been harder.\"\nHe left open the idea of meeting with the Ukrainian leader when world leaders gather for Pope Francis's funeral on Saturday.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he could end the Ukraine-Russia war in one day, but as he approaches his 100th day in office, a truce remains elusive.\n\"The president is frustrated,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. \"His patience is running very thin.\"\nVance warned on Wednesday that the US would \"walk away\" from its deal-making role if Russia and Ukraine do not come to an agreement - echoing comments last week by Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\nUS officials also pulled out of a London meeting to focus on talks in Moscow, as the pace of diplomacy to end the war quickens.\nThe London talks between officials from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine and the US aimed at securing a ceasefire were downgraded this week after Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff pulled out.\nInstead, Trump's Ukraine envoy Gen Keith Kellogg attended the talks in London, and Witkoff will head to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin for the fourth time.\nBritish diplomats said they were not entirely clear why Rubio and Witkoff had pulled out of the London talks.\nThe US state department blamed logistical reasons, but it was clear the decision was last-minute and left the Foreign Office wrongfooted.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of strategic industries, said Ukrainian negotiators would attend the London meeting on a \"very clear, narrow mandate\" to achieve a ceasefire that will \"pave the way for further talks\".\nRussia intensified attacks on Ukraine since Wednesday followed a brief lull over Easter when it halted air strikes.\nPutin called a temporary ceasefire for the Easter weekend but UK Defence Secretary John Healey told the House of Commons on Tuesday that British military intelligence had found no evidence of a let-up in attacks.\n\"While Putin has said he declared an Easter truce, he broke it,\" he said. \"While Putin says he wants peace, he has rejected a full ceasefire; and while Putin says he wants to put an end to the fighting, he continues to play for time in the negotiations.\"\nIt is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and nearly seven million Ukrainians are currently listed as refugees worldwide.\nThe conflict goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed Crimea and backed militants in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine."

      "text": "Trump administration pauses U.S. military aid to Ukraine\nThe Trump administration has paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine, the White House confirmed Monday. It's the latest fallout days after a contentious meeting between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House erupted into an open dispute in front of TV cameras.\n\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"\nThe U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons for Ukraine as it continues to fend off Russian troops three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion three years ago. But Mr. Trump's return to office has brought a marked shift in U.S. policy toward the conflict, with the president blaming Ukraine for the war Russia started.\nFriday's meeting, which was meant to precede the signing of an economic and minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, devolved into a confrontation.\nMr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. The meeting abruptly ended without signing the rare earth minerals deal, and several White House officials told CBS News that the future of military aid for Ukraine was in doubt.\nSince Mr. Trump took office in January, $3.85 billion has been available in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, U.S. officials previously told CBS News. But the Trump administration has not packaged any of that aid for a single shipment since Jan. 21, a diplomatic source told CBS News Monday. Still, there have been shipments of weapons sent to Ukraine since Jan. 20 that were promised by the Biden administration in earlier drawdowns, according to defense officials.\nThe $3.85 billion is spending authority, not congressionally appropriated funds, which means it's up to the White House to determine whether to release the aid. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere.\nSeparately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. So far, the Trump State Department has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.\nAfter Friday's meeting, Zelenskyy traveled to London for a summit with European and Canadian leaders, where he stressed the importance of Western security guarantees as part of any agreement that would bring the war to an end. He said in Ukrainian that peace with Russia was \"still very, very far away,\" but he thought that Ukraine-U.S. relations would hold.\nMr. Trump later posted a link to an Associated Press story covering Zelenskyy's comments and wrote, \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\"\n\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\" Mr. Trump added.\nMr. Trump's hardened stance on Ukraine has rankled some GOP lawmakers.\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday, \"I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It's the Ukrainians who are shedding blood. It is Putin who launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on a free, democratic and sovereign country. And I am not backing off my support for Ukraine.\"\nBefore the Trump administration's announcement Monday, Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota who serves on the Armed Services Committee, said of Ukraine, \"I'll simply say that we've got to get back on track again.\"\n\"It's critical that we get a minerals agreement put together and that we work on getting a security agreement with Ukraine,\" Rounds told reporters at the Capitol. \"They have been attacked. Russia is in the wrong, but we want to find a pathway to peace, and that means somebody has got to be the intermediary. I don't know if the president wants to be that. We need to give him the opportunity, but Russia is the aggressor, and we have to recognize that.\"\nMr. Trump said last month that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has also directed Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.\nBut Rubio said in February there was \"a long ways to go\" before peace talks could begin.\nDelegations led by Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, shortly after those comments, without Ukrainian officials present. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said after the meeting that Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\""

      "text": "Putin, Trump envoy Witkoff meet in Moscow ahead of Trump deadline for Russia to agree to end Ukraine war\nRussian President Vladimir Putin held talks with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Wednesday, days before the White House's deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or potentially face severe economic penalties that could also hit countries buying its oil.\nThe meeting lasted about three hours, Russian state media said. Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said that Putin and Witkoff had a \"useful and constructive conversation\" that focused on the Ukrainian crisis and, in a nod toward improving relations between Washington and Moscow, \"prospects for possible development of strategic cooperation between the U.S. and Russia.\"\nMr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that the meeting was \"highly productive.\"\n\"Great progress was made! Afterwards, I updated some of our European Allies. Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come,\" the president said.\nBefore the meeting with Putin, Witkoff took an early morning stroll through Zaryadye Park, a stone's throw from the Kremlin, with Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian president's envoy for investment and economic cooperation, footage aired by Russian news agency TASS showed.\nDmitriev played a key role in three rounds of direct talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul in recent months, as well as discussions between Russian and U.S. officials. The negotiations have made no progress on ending the three-year war following Russia's invasion of its neighbor.\nMr. Trump's deadline for Putin ends Friday. Washington has threatened \"severe tariffs\" and other economic penalties if the killing doesn't stop.\nA senior Trump administration official said the meeting between Witkoff and Putin \"went well.\"\n\"The Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States,\" the official said. \"The secondary sanctions are still expected to be implemented on Friday.\"\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that Witkoff was on his way back to the U.S., adding that \"hopefully there'll be some announcements here fairly soon. Maybe positive, maybe not. We'll see.\"\nMr. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Putin over Russia's escalating strikes on civilian areas of Ukraine, intended to erode morale and the public's appetite for the war. The intensified attacks have occurred even as Mr. Trump has urged the Russian leader in recent months to relent.\nOvernight from Tuesday to Wednesday, Russian forces hit a recreational center in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region, killing two people and injuring 12, including two children, regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov said Wednesday.\nRussian forces launched at least four strikes on the area and initially attacked with powerful glide bombs.\n\"There is zero military sense in this strike. Only cruelty to intimidate,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.\nWestern analysts and Ukrainian officials say Putin is stalling for time and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian forces push to capture more Ukraine land. A Russian offensive that started in the spring and is expected to continue through the fall is advancing faster than last year's push but is making only slow and costly gains and has been unable to take any major cities.\nThe situation on the front line is critical for Ukrainian forces but defenses are not about to collapse, analysts say.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll see what happens\" regarding his threat to slap tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil, which could increase import taxes dramatically on China and India.\n\"We have a meeting with Russia tomorrow,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to see what happens. We'll make that determination at that time.\"\nMr. Trump is also pressuring India, a huge buyer along with China of Russian oil. On Wednesday, he signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India for buying Russian oil, on top of a 25% tariff he ordered last week.\nStepping up diplomatic and economic pressure on the Kremlin risks stoking international tensions amid worsening Russia-U.S. relations. The Kremlin says threats to take steps against nations that trade with Russia are illegal.\nThe Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis warned in an assessment this week that there are \"clear signs that the Kremlin is preparing for a broader confrontation with NATO,\" including a military build-up along Russia's western flank with alliance countries in recent years.\nPutin has given no hint that he might be ready to make concessions. Instead, the Russian leader and senior Kremlin officials have talked up the country's military strength.\nPutin announced last week that Russia's new hypersonic missile, which he says can't be intercepted by current NATO air defense systems, has entered service.\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, meantime, warned that the Ukraine war could bring Russia and the U.S. into armed conflict. Mr. Trump responded to that by ordering the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday welcomed Witkoff's visit. \"We consider (talks with Witkoff) important, substantive and very useful,\" he said.\nMr. Trump initially gave Moscow a 50-day deadline, but later moved up his ultimatum as the Kremlin continued to bomb Ukrainian cities.\nHowever, Mr. Trump himself doubted their effectiveness, saying Sunday that Russia has proven to be \"pretty good at avoiding sanctions.\"\n\"They're wily characters,\" he said of the Russians.\nThe Kremlin has insisted that international sanctions imposed since its February 2022 invasion of its neighbor have had a limited impact.\nUkraine maintains the sanctions are taking their toll on Moscow's war machine and wants Western allies to ramp them up."

The Trump administration said the decision was made after a Pentagon review of U.S. military support and assistance to other countries. The pause was put in place because of concerns that U.S. military stockpiles were falling too low, a U.S. official said.\nMr. Trump also spoke Friday morning with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said he and Mr. Trump \"spoke about opportunities in air defense and agreed that we will work together to strengthen protection of our skies.\" Zelenskyy added that he and the U.S. president \"agreed to a meeting between our teams.\"\nSpeaking about his call with Putin, Mr. Trump told reporters in Washington overnight, \"I'm very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin because I don't think he's there.\"\nAsked on the way to a speech in Iowa Thursday if he made any progress with Putin on a potential deal on Ukraine, Mr. Trump said, \"No. I didn't make any progress with him today at all.\"\nThe U.S. president described it as a \"pretty long call\" in which he and Putin discussed a \"lot of things, including Iran.\"\n\"And we also talked about, as you know, the war with Ukraine,\" he said. \"And I'm not happy about that. I'm not happy about that.\"\nThe Kremlin said the call lasted nearly an hour. Asked about Mr. Trump's comments expressing disappointment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, \"Of course, we are paying very close attention to all of President Trump's statements.\"\nThe president and Putin spoke in mid-June, and Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as Russia's war on Ukraine continues with no end in sight. Russia has continued to launch assaults on Ukraine, stymying Mr. Trump's aspirations of a ceasefire."

      "text": "Trump says U.S. will send more weapons to Ukraine, after halting some shipments\nPresident Trump said Monday his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, days after pausing some weapons shipments.\n\"We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a White House event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday night.\nThe president said the shipments will consist of \"defensive weapons, primarily,\" saying Ukraine is \"getting hit very hard\" and \"so many people are dying in that mess.\"\n\"At President Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement later Monday night. \"Our framework for POTUS to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defense priorities.\"\nMatthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said the president has taken issue with Russia's strikes on Ukrainian cities.\n\"It is one thing to attack militaries \u2014 and we have thousands of people every week dying on the battlefield \u2014 but Vladimir Putin is attacking major cities like Odessa and Kyiv, and I think that is crossing the line,\" he told Fox's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"And I think President Trump has told Vladimir Putin that, you know, attacking citizens is just not something that you can do legitimately.\"\nAsked Tuesday about Mr. Trump's announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that \"these actions probably do not align with attempts to promote a peaceful resolution\" to the war in Ukraine, according to Russia's state-run news agencies.\nThe United States has provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in weapons and other assistance since February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country, according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.\nLast week, the White House confirmed it had decided to halt some shipments to Ukraine. A White House official said the pause was part of a broader review of weapons transfers to other countries. A U.S. official told CBS News the administration was concerned about military stockpiles falling too low.\nBut during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't know who ordered the pause in weapons shipments to Ukraine.\n\"Putin is not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people,\" the president told reporters during the meeting. \"So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that.\"\nMultiple sources with knowledge confirmed to CBS News that the State Department was cut out of the decision to pause some weapons shipments to Ukraine. Sources said the freeze was largely presented to Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a review of weapons shipments and not specifically described as a halt of arms to Ukraine. The White House was also told of the broader review for all weapons, which has been publicly discussed by the White House, Pentagon and State Department. One U.S. official told CBS News the Defense Department did not inform the White House of the pause.\nIn comments to reporters last week, Mr. Trump said his administration was still sending weapons to Ukraine, but former President Joe Biden \"emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.\"\nMr. Trump spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week. Mr. Trump told reporters he was \"very disappointed\" with the Putin call, saying he \"didn't make any progress\" with the Russian leader.\nMr. Trump also said Monday he's \"not happy with President Putin at all.\"\nMeanwhile, Zelenskyy said his call with Mr. Trump was \"very important and fruitful,\" adding the two leaders \"agreed that we will work together to strengthen protection of our skies.\"\nMr. Trump has pressed Russia and Ukraine to strike a deal to end their three-year war.\nBut his relationship with both leaders has been rocky at times. Mr. Trump \u2014 who has expressed skepticism about Ukraine aid \u2014 accused Zelenskyy in April of prolonging the conflict, and the administration briefly paused military aid to Ukraine in March, after a televised Oval Office meeting-turned-argument between the American and Ukrainian leaders. Mr. Trump has also lashed out at Putin over Russian strikes on Ukraine."

The two leaders released a joint statement after their respective news conferences affirming that \"even during periods of tension,\" they can make progress on \"ensuring predictability in the strategic sphere, reducing the risk of armed conflicts and the threat of nuclear war.\"\nBiden told reporters that Putin \"knows I will take action\" in working to stop Russia from engaging in malign activities like interfering in U.S. elections, engaging in hacking attacks, like those targeting SolarWinds and ransomware attacks on U.S. companies. Mr. Biden added Putin \"knows there are consequences\" and said Russia's credibility \"shrinks\" when it participates in cyberattacks.\nStill, when pressed by reporters on whether he was confident Putin would change his behavior, Mr. Biden said \"I'm not confident of anything.\"\nThe president also said Putin knew there would be consequences if jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies.\nPutin, meanwhile, at his press conference, did not address Navalny by name, but said Navalny had deliberately broken the law and wanted to be arrested when he returned to Russia after receiving treatment in Germany for his near-fatal poisoning. Navalny, the U.S. and western countries blame his poisoning on Russia.\nThe Russian president skirted the topic of Ukraine after NATO affirmed Ukraine's sovereignty at its recent meeting in Brussels.\nAddressing reporters on the tarmac before boarding Air Force One, Mr. Biden apologized for losing his temper with CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins, saying he was being a \"wise guy.\" Mr. Biden said his first foreign trip showed \"America is back\" and said he owes world leaders a \"\"debt of gratitude\" for backing him in Putin talks.\nMr. Biden told reporters there is a value in being both \"realistic\" and putting on a \"optimistic face\" after telling reporters they only ask negative questions. \"I started working on arms agreements going back to the Cold War.

Social media had quickly picked up on clips of the exchange.\n\"I owe my last questioner an apology,\" the president said.\nThe president boarded Air Force One at 8:33 p.m., en route for Joint Base Andrews.\nU.S. and Russia issue joint statement on strategic stability\nAs Mr. Biden wrapped up his day in Geneva, the White House released the Joint U.S.-Russia statement on strategic stability:\n\"We, President of the United States of America Joseph R. Biden and President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, note the United States and Russia have demonstrated that, even in periods of tension, they are able to make progress on our shared goals of ensuring predictability in the strategic sphere, reducing the risk of armed conflicts and the threat of nuclear war,\" the presidents wrote.\n\"The recent extension of the New START Treaty exemplifies our commitment to nuclear arms control. Today, we reaffirm the principle that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Consistent with these goals, the United States and Russia will embark together on an integrated bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue in the near future that will be deliberate and robust.

The White House later said the president was merely nodding to acknowledge the press.\nBiden calls Putin's comparison of political opponents to rioters at Capitol on January 6 \"ridiculous\"\nMr. Biden rejected Putin's comments during his press conference likening jailed and murdered political opponents to those arrested at the U.S. Capitol for their roles in the January 6 insurrection, calling it a \"ridiculous comparison.\"\n\"It's one thing for literally criminals to break through cordons, go into the Capitol, kill a police officer and be held unaccountable than it is for people objecting, marching on the Capitol and saying you are not allowing me to speak freely, you are not allowing me to do A, B, C, D,\" the president said. \"They're very different criteria.\"\nMore than 460 people have been arrested in connection with the Capitol attack.\nBiden says that if Navalny dies, the consequences \"would be devastating for Russia\"\nPresident Biden said he told Putin that if political activist and opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies, \"the consequences of that would be devastating for Russia.\"\nHe did not say what those consequences would be, and in public remarks has been vague about what actions the U.S. would take in the event of Navalny's death, or what it would do in response to further cyber attacks assessed to have been undertaken by Russian state actors.\nPutin has said he cannot guarantee Navalny will make it out of prison alive.\nBiden says Putin \"knows there are consequences\" to malicious cyber activities\nMr. Biden said he ensured that Putin \"knows I will take action\" in working to stop Russia from engaging in malign activities like interference in U.S. elections, the sweeping hack of SolarWinds and ransomware attacks on U.S. companies.\n\"He knows there are consequences,\" the president said. He added that in addition to action from the U.S., Putin's \"credibility worldwide shrinks\" as a consequence for such cyber activity.\nMr. Biden also said such action by Russia or groups linked to Russia \"diminishes the standing of a country that is desperately trying to make sure it maintains its standing as a major world power.\"\nBiden says \"I did what I came to do\"\nMr. Biden, who declined to share his goals for the meeting ahead of time, said his desired outcome for the meeting was \"to discuss and raise the issue of strategic stability\" and how to take steps forward.\nThe U.S. and Russia will launch a bilateral strategic dialogue on issues like arms control, Mr. Biden said. They also discussed cybersecurity.\n\"I talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack, period,\" Mr. Biden said, adding that he gave Russian officials a list of 16 specific entities and sectors that are off-limit for cyber attacks.\nMr. Biden described his goals for the meeting as threefold \u2014 to identify areas of practical work together; to communicate directly that the U.S. will respond to actions that imperil U.S. interests or U.S. allies; and lay out the United States' priorities and values.\n\"I did what I came to do,\" said the president. He described the meeting's tone as \"good\" and \"positive.\"\n\"There wasn't any strident action taken,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Where we disagreed, I disagreed, stated where it was. Where he disagreed, he stated, but it was not done in a hyperbolic atmosphere that is too much of what's been going on.\"\n\u2014 Melissa Quinn and Kathryn Watson\nBiden gifted Putin custom aviator sunglasses and bison sculpture\nA White House official said Mr. Biden gave Putin a crystal sculpture of an American bison, made by Steuben Glass of New York, \"a stately interpretation of one of our nation's most majestic mammals and representative of strength, unity, resilience.\"\nThe sculpture will be presented on a cherry wood base, which is symbolic of President George Washington, with an custom engraved inscription plaque commemorating the meeting between Mr. Biden and Putin, the White House said. The American bison was named the national mammal of the U.S. in 2016.\nThe president also gave his Russian counterpart a pair of custom aviators made by Randolph USA. The company produced the HGU-4/P Aviator for fighter pilots in 1978 and in the years since has provided the U.S. military and NATO partners with aviators, which are made in Massachusetts, the White House official said.\nMr. Biden is known for wearing aviator sunglasses.\nBiden begins solo press conference\nPresident Biden kicked off his solo press conference by describing some of the things he told Putin.\n\"I know there was a lot of hype around this meeting, but it's pretty straightforward to me, the meeting,\" he said.\nMr. Biden said he and Putin \"share a unique responsibility, to manage the relationship between two powerful and proud countries. A relationship that has to be stable and predictable.\"\nMr. Biden said he told Putin his agenda is \"not against Russia or against anyone else,\" but \"for the American people.\"\nMr. Biden said he \"made it clear\" that he will continue to raise human rights issues, like the cases of Alexey Navalny, and Americans Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan.\n\"Human rights is always going to be on the table, I told him,\" Mr. Biden said.\nPutin press conference ends after about an hour\nPutin ended his press conference after roughly an hour, taking questions from both Russian and foreign press.\nMr. Biden's solo press conference is expected momentarily.\nWatch the full press conference in the player below:\nPutin says no White House invite from Biden\nPutin told reporters through an interpreter that Mr. Biden did not extend an invitation for him to visit the White House and said \"no invitation was given.\" Such visits, he said, need to take place under the \"proper conditions.\"\nPutin called Mr. Biden \"very constructive, a very balanced professional man,\" and the relationship with the president \"pragmatic.\"\n\"He's very experienced, you can tell that at first glance,\" Putin said of Mr. Biden.\nThe Russian president recalled Mr. Biden talked about his mother and said the comments about the president's family \"shows the extent of his moral values.\"\n\"It seems to me that we did speak the same language,\" Putin said. \"It certainly doesn't imply that we looked into each other's eyes and found a soul or swore eternal friendship.\"\nIn 2001, then-President Bush said after meeting Putin in Slovenia that he had looked Putin in the eye and he \"found him to be very straight-forward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue.\"\n\"I was able to get a sense of his soul,\" Mr. Bush said then.\nPutin compares jailing of his political opponents to arrests of U.S. rioters from January 6 attack\nPutin compared the imprisonment and murders of opponents under his regime to the arrests of U.S. rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6.\nAn ABC News journalist asked Putin why he suppresses his political dissidents and opponents, and why he fears them. Putin responded that the Capitol rioters came to Congress with political demands and ended up facing prison sentences, and are being called domestic terrorists.\n\"It's unclear on what grounds,\" the autocrat said, despite clear charges laid out by U.S. prosecutors.\nPutin continued to try to turn back to the U.S., blasting the Black Lives Matter movement and claiming the U.S. allows disorder and destruction in its own country. Putin said Russia feels sympathy, but he doesn't want outbursts in Russia.\nPutin is known for displays of whataboutism, and for trying to equate the human rights abuses of his regime with what happens in democracies.\nPutin skirts topic of Ukraine\nPutin tried to avoid questions on Ukraine and on Russia's crackdown on opposition groups by claiming he couldn't hear them.\nThe Russian president did say the topic of Ukraine and its NATO aspirations came up and \"remains to be discussed. He said Russia will abide by the Minsk Agreement, a framework for ending the fighting in eastern Ukraine. However, the conflict there continues.\nNATO reaffirmed Ukraine's sovereignty at its recent meeting in Brussels but has not yet accepted it as a member nation. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and President Biden each indicated that Ukraine still needs to do more to fight corruption.\nDeclining to call Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny by name, Putin claims he knew Navalny was breaking law\nAsked about jailed Kremlin opponent Alexey Navalny, who was poisoned last year with the Societ-era nerve agent Novichok, Putin claimed Navalny deliberately broke the law and wanted to be arrested when he returned to Russia after receiving treatment in Germany for the near-fatal poisoning.\nNavalny, Putin alleged through a translator, \"did what he wanted to do\" when he decided to return to Moscow in January. The Russian president said the opposition leader \"deliberately wanted to be arrested.\"\nPutin never identified Navalny by his name when addressing the question from a reporter from CNN, instead calling Navalny \"this man.\"\nThe White House and Navalny himself blame the Kremlin for Navalny's poisoning. Putin has denied ordering the hit on the opposition leader.\nPutin claims talks with Mr. Biden were \"constructive\"\nIn his press conference, Putin characterized the tone of his meeting with Mr. Biden as \"quite constructive\" and said the U.S. and Russia are seeking \"common ground.\"\n\"I don't think there was any kind of hostility,\" he said, through a translator.\nBut Putin didn't address head-on concerns that ransomware attacks on the U.S. have originated in Russia. Putin, through a translator, claimed Russia has answered all U.S. inquiries about cyber attacks. He also said it's time to get rid of \"insinuations\" and \"innuendo.\"\nPutin also suggested the U.S. is the main aggressor in cyber attacks globally, not Russia.\nStill, Putin said they agreed to \"begin consultations in this respect.\"\n\u2014 Melissa Quinn and Kathryn Watson\nPutin claims he and Biden agreed to return ambassadors to their posts\nIn response to a question from a Russian reporter, Putin claimed he and Mr. Biden had agreed to return ambassadors to their respective posts in the U.S. and Russia.\nHe did not elaborate any further, and it wasn't clear when those ambassadors would return.\nPutin also said he and Mr. Biden addressed Ukraine, but not in depth.\nBiden-Putin summit concludes\nThe highly anticipated summit between Mr. Biden and Putin concluded when an expanded bilateral meeting broke at 5:05 p.m. CEST, or 11:05 a.m. ET, according to a White House official.\nThe expanded bilateral meeting began at 4 p.m. local time, meaning it lasted barely an hour, and was not split into two parts as had been scheduled. Before that was a smaller bilateral meeting.\nNext, Putin is expected to hold a solo press conference. Mr. Biden will hold a solo press conference after Putin's.\nIt is unclear when Mr. Biden's press conference will begin.\nWhite House says Biden nod didn't indicate trust in Putin\nThe White House insists Mr. Biden did not indicate trust in Putin with a nod to a reporter who shouted a question at him during a chaotic photo opportunity ahead of the summit.\nA pool reporter in the room said the president looked her \"directly in the eye and nodded his head\" in the affirmative when she asked him whether he trusts Putin.\nA couple hours after the interaction, however, the White House gave a different interpretation of what had happened.\n\"During a chaotic free for all with members of the press shouting questions over each other, the President gave a general head nod in the direction of the media. He wasn't responding to any question or anything other than the chaos,\" Psaki said in a statement.\nThe journalist involved said they were \"at the front of the room\" with only one other reporter asking questions when the exchange occurred.\nBiden and Putin shake hands before kicking off talks\nPresident Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin shook hands on the front steps of the hotel in Geneva, Switzerland that is hosting their summit on Wednesday, before going inside for the hours-long talks.\nNews cameras were allowed into the room to photograph the two leaders sitting together before the talks began. The presidents were joined in the room for the first session of discussions by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, along with translators for each side.\nPutin thanked Mr. Biden for showing initiative to arrange the summit and expressed hope that it would be a productive meeting.\nLater sessions were to see a wider group of officials from both sides join the presidents and their top diplomats.\nPutin arrives in Geneva for summit\nRussian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Geneva at about midday local time (6 a.m. Eastern) on Wednesday, flying into Switzerland from Moscow less than an hour before he was expected to shake hands with U.S. President Joe Biden.\nMr. Biden flew into Geneva on Tuesday after a week of meetings with European allies.\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov showed up at the hotel in Geneva where the summit is taking place ahead of his boss. He told Russian television in an interview aired before the meeting that Putin expected \"difficult\" talks with his American counterpart, but that Russia was approaching the summit with a \"working\" attitude, not a confrontational one.\nPeskov said there was a need by both countries to \"clear all the rubble\" in bilateral relations, noting specifically Moscow's desire to regain control of Russian-owned properties in the U.S. that were seized by the American government years ago."

      "text": "Armenia and Azerbaijan leaders join Trump to sign peace agreement at White House summit\nWashington \u2014 The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands as they joined President Trump at the White House on Friday for a peace summit where they signed an agreement aimed at ending decades of conflict.\nThe two countries in the South Caucasus signed agreements with each other and the U.S. that will reopen key transportation routes while allowing the U.S. to seize on Russia's declining influence in the region. The deal includes an agreement that will create a major transit corridor to be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, the White House said.\nMr. Trump said at the White House on Friday that naming the route after him was \"a great honor for me\" but \"I didn't ask for this.\"\nA senior administration official, on a call before the event with reporters, said it was the Armenians who suggested the name.\nAt the peace summit on Friday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said the transit corridor will \"create connectivity opportunities for so many countries.\"\n\"We are starting the path toward strategic partnership,\" he said.\nArmenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the agreement a \"significant milestone.\"\n\"We are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past,\" Pashinyan said.\nBoth leaders said the breakthrough was made possible by Mr. Trump and his team and joined a growing list of foreign leaders and other officials who have said the U.S. leader should receive a Nobel Peace Prize \u2014something he has coveted.\n\"President Trump in six months did a miracle,\" Aliyev said.\nMr. Trump remarked on how long the conflict went on between the two countries and said of the agreement, \"Thirty-five years they fought and now they're friends and they're going to be friends a long time.\"\nThat route will connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 20-mile-wide patch of Armenian territory. The demand from Azerbaijan had held up peace talks in the past.\nMr. Trump indicated he'd like to visit the route at some point, saying, \"We're going to have to get over there.\"\n\"The roadmap they are agreeing to will build a cooperative future that benefits both countries, their region of the South Caucasus and beyond,\" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Friday. She added that the new transit corridor will \"allow unimpeded connectivity between the two countries while respecting Armenia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and its people.\"\nAsked how he feels about lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump said \"very confident\" as he welcomed both leaders to the White House on Friday afternoon.\nFriday's signing adds to the handful of peace and economic agreements brokered this year by the U.S., while Mr. Trump has made no secret of his wish to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in helping to ease long-running conflicts across the globe.\nThe peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda helped end the decadeslong conflict in eastern Congo, and the U.S. mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, while Trump intervened in clashes between Cambodia and Thailand by threatening to withhold trade agreements with both countries if their fighting continued. Yet peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine have been elusive.\nThe signing of a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, also strikes a geopolitical blow to their former imperial master, Russia. Throughout the nearly four-decade conflict, Moscow played mediator to expand its clout in the strategic South Caucasus region, but its influence waned quickly after it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Trump-brokered deal would allow the U.S. to deepen its reach in the region as Moscow retreats, senior U.S. administration officials said.\nThe Trump administration began engaging with Armenia and Azerbaijan in earnest earlier this year, when Mr. Trump's key diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Aliyev in Baku and started to discuss what a senior administration official called a \"regional reset.\"\nNegotiations over who will develop the Trump Route \u2014 which will eventually include a rail line, oil and gas lines, and fiber optic lines \u2014 will likely begin next week, and at least nine developers have expressed interest already, according to the senior administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.\nSeparate from the joint agreement, both Armenia and Azerbaijan signed deals with the United States meant to bolster cooperation in energy, technology and the economy, the White House said.\nMr. Trump previewed much of Friday's plan in a social media post Thursday evening, in which he said the agreements would \"fully unlock the potential\" of the South Caucasus region.\n\"Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to 'TRUMP,'\" the president said on his Truth Social site.\nMr. Trump, Pashinyan and Aliyev gathered for the signing ceremony in the State Dining Room. That peace declaration was the first signed by both Armenia and Azerbaijan since the end of the Cold War, according to the administration.\nAmong the documents that that was set to be signed was a letter that asks the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to dissolve its Minsk Group, established in the 1990s and co-chaired by Russia, France and the U.S. to mediate the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The White House said Friday that the group is no longer relevant.\nThe two nations were locked in conflict for nearly four decades as they fought for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh.\nThe area was largely populated by Armenians during the Soviet era but is located within Azerbaijan. The two nations battled for control of the region through multiple violent clashes that left tens of thousands of people dead over the decades, all while international mediation efforts failed.\nMost recently, Azerbaijan reclaimed all of Karabakh in 2023 and had been in talks with Armenia to normalize ties. Azerbaijan's insistence on a land bridge to Nakhchivan had been a major sticking point, because while Azerbaijan did not trust Armenia to control the so-called Zangezur corridor, Armenia resisted control by a third party because it viewed it as a breach of sovereignty.\nBut the prospect of closer ties with the United States, as well as being able to move in and out of the landlocked nation more freely without having to access Georgia or Iran, helped entice Armenia on the broader agreement, according to U.S. officials.\nMeanwhile, Russia stood back when Azerbaijan reclaimed control of Karabakh in the September 2023 offensive, angering Armenia, which has moved to shed Russian influence and turn westward. Azerbaijan, emboldened by its victory in Karabakh, also has become increasingly defiant in its relations with Moscow."

      "text": "Putin needles U.S. by giving Trump envoy an award meant for CIA official whose son died fighting for Russia\nWashington \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin gave President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff an award to pass along to a senior CIA official whose son was killed in Ukraine while fighting alongside Russian forces, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nThe award, the Order of Lenin, was meant to be handed off to Juliane Gallina, whose 21-year-old son, Michael Gloss, was killed in 2024.\nGallina is currently serving at the CIA as deputy director for digital innovation. It could not be immediately determined what was done with the award.\nMultiple sources told CBS News that Putin gave Witkoff the award during his trip to Russia this week, which a Russian official said the U.S. initiated, to discuss ending the Ukraine war.\nThe gesture by Putin, known for mind games and attempts to expose adversaries' points of weakness, was likely meant to raise unhelpful questions and highlight that a CIA official's son fought for Russia in the war.\nIn a statement in April, CIA officials said the death of Gallina's son, who struggled with mental health challenges, was not a national security issue. Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News there was no indication that Gloss had been recruited by the Russian government, and that the Kremlin did not appear to be aware of Gloss's family background when it repatriated his remains.\nSpokespeople for the White House, the CIA and Witkoff didn't respond with comment for this article. A Russian embassy spokesman contacted by CBS News said there was no official comment, and no acknowledgement of the award has been publicly disclosed by the Kremlin or Russian Foreign Ministry.\nPutin's move comes at a sensitive time, as Mr. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with the Kremlin and has vowed secondary tariffs starting on Friday, even as negotiations are underway for a possible summit.\nThe Order of Lenin is a Soviet-era award meant to highlight outstanding civilian service. It has been given to high-level spies, including the U.K.'s Kim Philby, a double agent for the Soviet Union. Gallina's son was never an employee of the CIA, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nPutin, a former KGB operative, has met five times with Witkoff, who left real estate development to become Mr. Trump's envoy for sensitive peace missions. Witkoff's reliance in the past on Russian government translators during high-stakes diplomacy has drawn scrutiny.\nA source familiar with the talks told CBS News that Witkoff had a U.S. government translator with him for the encounter on Wednesday, two days before Mr. Trump's deadline for Putin to end the war or face severe financial penalties via sanctions. That same day, the Trump administration put an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods to punish New Delhi for continuing to purchase Russian oil.\nMr. Trump described the Wednesday meeting in Moscow as \"highly productive.\" The White House said the Russians were eager to continue engaging with the United States and said that secondary sanctions were due to be implemented on Friday. However, as of Friday afternoon, no such sanctions had been issued.\nOn social media, Gloss published posts of himself in Moscow and voiced his support for Russian troops. Russian media first published news of Gloss' death in April. The CIA's statement at the time said Gallina and her family had suffered \"an unimaginable personal tragedy.\"\nAn obituary for Gloss said he was \"tragically killed in Eastern Europe\" on April 4, 2024.\nGloss's father, Larry Gloss, an Iraq War veteran, told the Washington Post in an interview that he and Gallina did not know their son was in Ukraine or that he had enlisted in the Russian army.\n\"Our biggest fear while we were waiting for him to be repatriated was that someone over there [in Moscow] would put two and two together and figure out who his mother was, and use him as a prop,\" Larry Gloss said."

      "text": "Putin\u2019s uncompromising demands emerge after the latest round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks\nPutin\u2019s uncompromising demands emerge after the latest round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks\nRussia took weeks to present Ukraine with a \u201cmemorandum\u201d setting out its conditions for a ceasefire, as well as key guidelines for a comprehensive treaty to end the more than 3-year-old war. To practically no one\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s a list of the Kremlin\u2019s longstanding, maximalist demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as nonstarters.\nUkraine had set its negotiating stance before Monday\u2019s direct peace talks in Istanbul, emphasizing its readiness to declare a 30-day ceasefire immediately without preconditions that was proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Kyiv reaffirmed its refusal to abandon a bid for NATO membership and rejected acknowledgment of Russia\u2019s annexation of any of its regions.\nBoth sides have established mutually exclusive red lines that make any quick deal unlikely.\nMoscow\u2019s demands, published in the Russian media, make it clear that President Vladimir Putin is determined to ensure the fulfillment of the goals in Ukraine he set when he launched the invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\nKey points of the Russian and Ukrainian documents:\nMoscow\u2019s conditions for a 30-day truce\nRussia offered Ukraine a choice of two options for establishing a 30-day ceasefire.\nOne option is that Ukraine must withdraw its forces from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 the four regions Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured.\nThe second option, described by Moscow as the \u201cpackage\u201d proposal, presses Ukraine to halt its mobilization efforts and freeze Western arms deliveries \u2014 conditions that were suggested earlier by Putin.\nOn top of that, the document also demands that Ukraine begin demobilizing its military, halt any redeployment of forces and ban the presence of any third-country forces on its soil.\nThe \u201cpackage\u201d option further proposes that Ukraine end martial law and hold elections, after which the two countries could sign a comprehensive peace treaty.\nRussia\u2019s terms for a comprehensive peace treaty\nThe Russian document declares that conditions for peace must include the \u201cinternational legal recognition\u201d of Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and its 2022 annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\nIt says a future peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, and abandon its bid to join NATO. The document demands that Ukraine limit the size of its armed forces, recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian, ban \u201cglorification and propaganda of Nazism and neo-Nazism\u201d and dissolve nationalist groups -\u2013 conditions reflecting Putin\u2019s goals from the outset of his invasion.\nThe false allegations that neo-Nazi groups were shaping Ukraine\u2019s politics under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, have been vehemently dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies.\nIn Russia\u2019s view, a comprehensive peace treaty should also see both countries lift all sanctions and restrictions, abandon any claims to compensation for wartime damage, resume trade and communications, and reestablish diplomatic ties. It also suggests that the peace treaty between Russian and Ukraine be endorsed by a resolution of the U.N. Security Council.\nUkraine\u2019s ceasefire position also remains firm\nThe memorandum that Ukraine submitted to Moscow before the talks and shared with its allies emphasized the need for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to set stage for peace negotiations.\nIt reaffirmed Ukraine\u2019s consistent rejection of Russian demands for neutral status as an attack on its sovereignty, declaring it is free to choose its alliances and adding that its NATO membership will depend on consensus with the alliance.\nIt emphasized Kyiv\u2019s rejection of any restrictions on the size and other parameters of its armed forces, as well as curbs on the presence of foreign troops on its soil.\nUkraine\u2019s memorandum also opposed recognizing any Russian territorial gains, while describing the current line of contact as a starting point in negotiations.\nThe document noted the need for international security guarantees to ensure the implementation of peace agreements and prevent further aggression.\nThe Ukrainian peace proposal also demanded the return of all deported and illegally displaced Ukrainian children and an \u201call-for-all\u201d prisoner exchange.\nIt held the door open to gradual lifting of some of the sanctions against Russia if it abides by the agreement.\nThe opposing positions make peace seem elusive\nThe sharply conflicting demands leave little hope for any quick progress in talks.\nBy maintaining its maximalist demands, Moscow is seemingly unfazed by repeated threats of sanctions by the West or other pressure to make real concessions.\nSome observers see the Russian memorandum as a way by Moscow to formalize its negotiation position.\n\u201cEven an unsigned document gives the Kremlin a firmer diplomatic foothold,\u201d said Moscow-based defense analyst Sergei Poletaev.\nTatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center noted that the document reflects Putin\u2019s key goal of securing a \u201cfriendly\u201d Ukraine without a full-fledged military or ties of any kind with its Western allies.\nShe noted the Russian document offers Ukraine a choice between the two options because Moscow knows that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the four regions \u201cis not viable and seeks to push Kyiv toward the second as the primary course.\u201d At the same time, Moscow\u2019s memorandum appears to indicate that \u201cRussia is open to considering leaving parts of the annexed regions that it does not control to Ukraine.\u201d\nStanovaya said Moscow\u2019s maximalist demands mean that \u201cthe fighting is set to continue, even if bilateral interactions persist.\u201d"
