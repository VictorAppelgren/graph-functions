  "description": "A secretive AI startup operating under the name of Astromech has been founded by Colossal Biosciences' founders. The pair have already raised $30 million for the company.",
  "content": "In the high-stakes world of biotech and de-extinction, Ben Lamm and George Church are household names. The founders of Colossal Biosciences, Lamm and Church are true pioneers of the industry and the company has done what no other bioscience company has done before. They de-extinct the dire wolf, created the controversial woolly mouse and promise to bring the woolly mammoth back from the grave. However, it was discovered earlier this week that a recent, almost silent, filing with the SEC suggests their next frontier is something far more cryptic. A digital breadcrumb has revealed a new, secretive AI startup operating under the name of Astromech.\n\nUnearthed from the dry and opaque world of financial documents, a Form D filing from August 12th, 2025 serves as the first undeniable evidence of the new venture. This single, unassuming document, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, shows that Lamm and Church have already successfully raised a staggering $30 million for the company. The paperwork lists them as co-founders and places the venture squarely in the technology sector, formally registered in the state of Delaware. The filing is a key that unlocks a treasure chest of questions, but provides frustratingly few answers. The de-extinction duo is notoriously public, so their total silence on this new company\u2014a fourth partnership in recent years\u2014is deafening.\n\nWhat exactly is Astromech? The name itself may be a clue, a nod to the iconic repair droids of the Star Wars universe\u2014compact, automated mechanics like the beloved R2-D2. But what is it they are aiming to repair or navigate?\n\nA minimal website\u2014a neon-drenched fever dream that feels like the opening sequence from a Nintendo video game\u2014offers the only other hints. The site is a barebones portal for job seekers, featuring a mysterious, animated logo of a swirling helix of DNA. Underneath this cryptic imagery is a single, powerful mission statement: navigating the code of life. Given Church's foundational work in genomics and synthetic biology, this is more than just a tagline; it's a declaration of intent. Astromech could be attempting to chart a new course in the digital mapping of our biological destiny.\n\nThe job titles listed on the website only deepen the mystery. They aren't for engineers or biologist, but for roles that sound ripped from a sci-fi novel: \"Synthetic Data Generation Lead,\" \"Multi-Agent Coordinator,\" \"Regulatory Genomics Specialist,\" \u201cEmergent Behavior Analyst\" and \"Robotics Specialized Physical Trainer.\" These aren't just jobs; they're clues, each one a piece of a larger, still-unseen puzzle pointing to a deeply complex project in advanced AI. When reached for comment, Lamm and a spokesperson for Colossal had a stark, uncharacteristic \"no comment,\" a phrase that only adds more fuel to the fire. Whatever Lamm and Church are building, they want to keep it in the shadows for now, leaving the rest of the world to wonder: are they building the ultimate co-pilot for biology, or are they laying the groundwork for something bigger?",

      "text": "ES23, a mysterious and prolific new artist whose bold and inspiring work has captivated art lovers over the last two years, has been revealed as Eugene Shvidler.\nA successful businessman, investor and philanthropist, Shvidler has long maintained a deep but private relationship with the world of art. It\u2019s a secret he held behind a pseudonym, and he has long been quietly producing compelling and deeply personal bodies of contemporary abstract work.\nShvidler has held a keen interest in art since childhood. Growing up in a creative household in the former USSR, his parents were both mathematicians, but were also expressive, artistic individuals. According to Shvidler, this rare combination of logic and imagination would go on to define not just his worldview, but the evolution of his artistic style decades later.\nAs a child, Shvidler displayed an early aptitude for drawing, painting and playing with form. At age 10, he was accepted into an art school in Moscow \u2014 indication of his talents. But as with many artists born into turbulent times, life took him on a different course.\nAfter emigrating to the United States in 1989, he earned an MBA from Fordham University in 1992. Shvidler immersed himself in building a career and his future, and today, he\u2019s a successful businessman and investor.\nWhile developing a successful business career, Shvidler quietly nurtured his love of painting, color theory, composition and visual storytelling. Over the years, he became an avid collector and patron of the arts \u2014 frequenting galleries and museums around the world, engaging with artists, and studying both classical and contemporary movements.\nShvidler began producing large-scale works, mostly in acrylic on canvas, from his private studios. The alias allowed him the freedom to explore his creativity, take risks, and express himself away from his work as a businessman. ES23 works primarily with acrylic on canvas, often building up layers without preparatory sketches, letting the work evolve organically on the canvas. Mostly self-taught, ES23 cites admiration for artists such as Blinky Palermo, Siena, Riley, and even early Kandinsky, though his style remains uniquely his own. His signature themes include abstract geometry, human expression, memory and resilience.\nIn March 2024, he made his public debut as ES23 with the exhibition \"100 Faces in Beverly Hills, presented by Kristy Stubbs Gallery and Yares Art. The series presents stylized human forms with vibrant emotion \u2014 some whimsical and some haunting \u2014 all uniquely rendered. These are inspired by people from all walks of life: friends, mentors, religious figures, even strangers who left an impression.\nThe show received immediate acclaim, with a foreword by renowned art advisor Sandy Heller, who recognized the emotional depth, precision and originality of ES23\u2019s work. Shvidler and Heller\u2019s relationship is rooted in mutual respect and a shared belief in the power of abstract storytelling, and was pivotal in bringing ES23\u2019s work into the public eye.\n\u201cSandy has been a dear friend for many years. His encouragement and gentle advice have always meant a lot to me,\u201d said Shvidler. \u201cFor him, this isn\u2019t just \u201cwork\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a true passion and an integral part of our relationship.\u201d\nLater that year, in November 2024, a follow-up exhibition titled Part II \u2013 Not So Abstract\u201d opened at Spanierman Modern on Madison Avenue in New York City, further cementing ES23\u2019s arrival as a serious voice in contemporary abstraction.\nPlanning the debut shows took around a month and response was overwhelmingly positive. The Los Angeles event coincided with Shvidler\u2019s birthday, which made for an extra-friendly atmosphere. He was also pleasantly surprised by unexpected visitors \u2014 including people from neighboring galleries.\nWhile any future shows are tightly under wraps, big things are currently in the works for Shvidler."

      "text": "Younger audiences are becoming increasingly tired with the rhetoric on the horrors of climate change, with research showing that Gen-Z feel that their climate-related concerns are often dismissed by older generations.\nEnter: Colossal Biosciences, a Texas-based biotech and genetic engineering company working tirelessly to de-extinct several animals and bring hope to the future of nature.\nCo-founded by entrepreneur Ben Lamm and Harvard geneticist George Church, Colossal Biosciences is tapping into the cultural zeitgeist by not only making bold scientific promises, but by embracing a storytelling approach that resonates with Gen Z. High school students write in asking how they can get involved; college students express inspiration to pursue science because of Colossal Biosciences\u2019 work. Their excitement is less about nostalgia and more about agency\u2014about changing the narrative of inevitable loss.\n\u201cIf history teaches us anything, it\u2019s that we shouldn\u2019t argue with youth,\u201d Colossal Biosciences CEO Lamm said. \u201cProgress often begins with what youth culture believes in,\u201d Citing historical youth-led movements, Lamm believes the younger generation is rallying around biotech and conservation innovation.\nNot only does the company have the backing of Gen-Z, but it has also garnered support from Hollywood\u2019s greatest. Peter Jackson, Tom Brady, Tiger Woods, Sophie Turner and George R.R. Martin have all endorsed or invested in Colossal Biosciences.\nThe company is focused on creating a de-extinction toolkit that can act as a fail-safe if the government, conservationists, environmentalists and citizens fail to do what is necessary to protect animal species.\nBy 2050, nearly half of all animal species could be threatened with extinction, which could pose significant impact on the global economy. Colossal Biosciences\u2019 mission is to stop or even reverse extinction and, to date, they have announced ambitious projects related to the woolly mammoth, thylacine, dodo and dire wolf.\nThe species selection is driven by an elaborate plan to assist conservationists, environmentalists, governments and organizations all over the world to biobank genetic materials, create resilience in faltering species lines and, if absolutely necessary, recover full species from extinction.\n\u201cIt goes back to the apathy point in your research that is making everyone feel so hopeless. We need to all be advocating for genetic rescue science to be used and for lots of advancements to be made in order to save species. But, do you know how hard it is to get people to care about progress or the need for progress in genetic science?\u201d Lamm noted. \u201cAlmost impossible. Do you know how easy it is to get people talking about bringing back their favorite ancient pachyderm? Substantially easier,\u201d\nLamm explained that he doesn\u2019t believe the company\u2019s mission can succeed without public support and an interest in and understanding of the new technologies his company is inventing.\nIn early 2025, the company made a breakthrough with the colossal woolly mouse, sharing parts of the woolly mammoth\u2019s DNA and proving the scientists\u2019 ability to recreate complex genetic combinations that took nature millions of years to create.\n\u201cWe need to get people excited about saving the planet, so that we have a shot at being able to actually save it. Part of the reason we are working to bring back the woolly mammoth is so that we could get the public to pay attention to genetic science; it\u2019s one part: holy s\u2014t how amazing. And one part: you\u2019re doing what now?\u201d Lamm explained. \u201cThat combination has allowed us to talk to a lot of people about what we are working on, why it\u2019s important for conservation and how they can get involved,\u201d\n\u201cIt is going to be their planet to care for,\u201d he added. \u201cWe see it as our job to make sure there is something left for them to take care of.\u201d"

      "text": "Women make up 43.1% of scientists in the U.S. workforce, yet they account for just 34% of the broader STEM fields, according to the National Science Foundation. Within these industries, many have faced sexual harassment or undue criticism throughout their careers, especially as their work garners public attention. The numbers\u2014and the stories\u2014are sobering.\nEnter Dr. Beth Shapiro, a powerhouse in genomic science. She has directed her own lab at the UC Santa Cruz, authored critically acclaimed books and previously held the prestigious title of HHMI Investigator. Now, as the Chief Science Officer at Colossal Biosciences, a groundbreaking company leading the charge in de-extinction, Shapiro is guiding a predominantly female team to reshape the future of conservation and genomics.\nWhile leaving academia wasn\u2019t an easy decision for Shapiro, she has gone on to work on some of the most exciting projects in her career. Last year, she made history when she brought the dire wolf back from extinction. On October 1, 2024, the first two dire wolf pups, Romulus and Remus, were born; on January 31, 2025, a third dire wolf named Khaleesi was welcomed into the world.\n\u201cWhat conservation needs is bold ideas and bold action. This breakthrough showcases that humans are capable of both. We can use biotechnologies to speed up the processes of selection and adaptation,\u201d she said in a statement on the Colossal website. \u201cWith the successful birth of Colossal's dire wolf, we are one step closer to a world in which these tools are among those at our disposal to help species thrive in their rapidly changing habitats.\u201d\nShe has faced some level of criticism for the project, and the harshest are often less qualified males in the STEM field. However, Shapiro is more concerned about the next generation.\n\u201cWe get letters from kids inspired by our work \u2014 our science, conservation efforts, and commitment to bettering the planet,\u201d she explained in an interview. \u201cI worry about them losing hope when they see how women in science are often treated.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t just about Shapiro; it\u2019s about the culture of tearing down women in fields where they\u2019re already underrepresented. The stakes are high\u2014not just for the scientists, but for the future of innovation itself.\nWhat Can We Do To Change The Narrative?\nLook Beyond The Headlines\nNot all scientists are created equal. Before buying into criticism, dig deeper into the credentials of those doing the critiquing. Are their accomplishments anywhere near the level of those they\u2019re disparaging?\nCall Out Inequality\nWhen you see women\u2019s work unfairly diminished, speak up. The more we normalize respect and fairness, the better the culture becomes.\nSupport Girls In STEM\nPrograms that encourage young women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and math. Donate, mentor or simply share resources that highlight their importance.\nChallenge The Status Quo\nQuestion why women face disproportionate scrutiny. Is it jealousy, insecurity, or outdated biases? Sometimes, the problem isn\u2019t the science. It\u2019s the ego of the critic.\nCelebrate Women\u2019s Wins\nShare their successes, amplify their voices, and ensure their stories reach the audiences they deserve."
