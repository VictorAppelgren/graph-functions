      "summary": "The upcoming U.S. jobs report is expected to show modest growth of about 75,000 jobs in August, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut rates in September to support employment amid tariff‑driven hiring slowdowns. Weak job data could prompt a September rate cut, as markets already price in an 82% probability, while stronger growth would likely keep rates elevated. The report also highlights concerns that Trump’s immigration crackdown and trade tariffs are dampening hiring, potentially leading to a labor shortage that could pressure wages and inflation.",
