  "description": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - September 4, 2025) - U.S. Critical Metals Corp. (CSE: USCM) (OTCQB: USCMF) (FSE: 0IU) (\"USCM\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has retained its 100% ownership of the past-producing Haynes Cobalt Project (the \"Haynes Cobalt Project\" or the \"Property\") in the highly prospective Idaho Cobalt Belt (the \"ICB\"), adjacent to Jervois Mining's Idaho Cobalt Operations. This asset aligns with the Company's long-term strategy to maintain,...",
  "content": "The Haynes Cobalt Property covers approximately 470 acres directly contiguous to Jervois Global's Idaho Cobalt Operations, which is the only primary cobalt mine in the U.S. 4 . Within past production from three adits, the Property lies within the historic Blackbird Mining District, known for its cobalt, copper, and gold mineralization, and benefits from proximity to established infrastructure. Of particular interest, USCM expects that the mineralization associated with the adjunct property may continue across the Property borders, as indicated in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below, outlining the historic underground workings.\n\nDarren Collins, CEO and Director of USCM, comments: \"Retaining the claims comprising the Haynes Cobalt Project underscores our conviction in the long-term importance of cobalt to U.S. supply chains. We are also encouraged to see increased U.S. government support for critical metals, as evidence by the recent US$400 million equity investment in MP Materials Corp. from the U.S. Department of Defense 3 . We anticipate these strategic transactions to continue within the U.S., both by government and corporates, as issues with under supply become increasingly prevalent.\"\n\nWith the U.S. currently holding only limited strategic cobalt stockpiles and very limited domestic cobalt production, USCM views the Haynes Cobalt Project as a potentially key asset in bridging future supply needs for defense, aerospace, and energy transition industries.\n\nThe U.S. continues to address cobalt needs through imports and releases from the National Defense Stockpile. As noted by the U.S. Geological Survey, only a small portion of supply needs are addressed by domestic production - primarily recycling and byproduct streams, which results in an over 75% dependence on external cobalt sources 1 . Recently, the U.S. military, through the Defense Logistics Agency, initiated a five-year, $500 million program to acquire approximately 7,480 tonnes of cobalt for strategic defense stockpiles, marking its first major purchase since the 1990s 2 .\n\nVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - September 4, 2025) - U.S. Critical Metals Corp. (CSE: USCM) (OTCQB: USCMF) (FSE: 0IU) (\" USCM \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that it has retained its 100% ownership of the past-producing Haynes Cobalt Project (the \" Haynes Cobalt Project \" or the \" Property \") in the highly prospective Idaho Cobalt Belt (the \" ICB \"), adjacent to Jervois Mining's Idaho Cobalt Operations. This asset aligns with the Company's long-term strategy to maintain, explore, and develop a portfolio of past-producing mineral properties hosting commodities critical to United States (\" U.S. \") interests.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8837/265124_uscm1en.jpg\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8837/265124_uscm2en.jpg\n\nThe Property was explored by Noranda Exploration Inc. (\"Noranda\") from 1979 to 1981, and Noranda again further developed the Property near three historical adits, with promising results from surface and underground drilling. Table 3 describes the results of the historical holes, some of which cross the current Property border, and the tenure of the historical information makes it uncertain whether the mineralized interval is on the Property or on the neighboring property5.\n\nAdditional reconnaissance work by Noranda in 1980 defined a two-kilometer trend of tourmaline-bearing breccia rocks on the Property. Tourmaline-bearing breccia is related to cobalt mineralization at the historical workings, and elsewhere in the ICB. Two samples were collected along this trend approximately 1.5 kilometres away from the historical adits and follow-up drilling by Noranda. The two samples are described in Table 4 below6.\n\nHistorical samples from the Property also contain heavy Rare-Earth Element (\"REE\") mineralization in the form of xenotime and is associated with cobaltite mineralization. This observation of a correlation between REE and cobaltite mineralization has not yet been investigated as an exploration target and represents an intriguing aspect to the Property. A USCM Qualified Person has not done enough work to verify the results of the historical exploration.\n\nIn 2021, USCM collected rock samples from the Property with continued positive results. A total of 76 rock samples were collected from historical workings including pits, trenches and adits, as well as non-mineralized outcrops. Assay results from a select few rock samples collected in 2021 are shown in table and map below. USCM is currently planning its next phase of exploration for the Property7.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8837/265124_uscm3en.jpg\n\nReference 2: Reuters.

The RAM deposit at ICO remains open at depth and along strike, and Jervois is confident of strong potential of both resource and reserve expansion.\nIn addition, Jervois has drilled the Sunshine deposit and historical mineral resource. The historical Sunshine cobalt resource is located a short traverse to the ICO mill and concentrator.\nICO is a key asset in delivering Jervois\u2019 strategy to become a leading independent cobalt and nickel company providing metals and minerals for the world\u2019s energy transition through a western supply chain."

  "argos_summary": "U.S. Critical Metals Corp. (USCM) has retained 100% ownership of the Haynes Cobalt Project in Idaho, a past\u2011producing asset adjacent to Jervois Mining\u2019s only U.S. cobalt mine. The move comes as the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency launches a $500\u202fmillion, five\u2011year program to acquire 7,480\u202ft of cobalt, underscoring the nation\u2019s heavy reliance on imports and the strategic need for domestic supply. USCM views the Idaho property as a key asset for defense, aerospace and energy\u2011transition industries, and highlights recent U.S. government support for critical metals, including a $400\u202fmillion equity investment in MP Materials. The company plans further exploration to confirm the property\u2019s potential to bridge future supply gaps for the U.S. critical\u2011metals supply chain.",
