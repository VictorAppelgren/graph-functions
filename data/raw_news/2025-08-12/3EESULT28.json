  "title": "The 7 Best Outdoor Bluetooth Speakers, Tested By Our Tech Editors",
  "description": "After testing over a dozen different models, our tech team thinks the best outdoor Bluetooth speakers include Bose, JBL and more.",
  "content": "Any outdoor Bluetooth speaker may be exposed to the elements, can potentially suffer accidental drops and more. But the best outdoor Bluetooth speakers can brush off rainstorms and accidents with ease for peace of mind, and they can last for hours on a single charge. After testing over a dozen options, I ultimately named the Bose SoundLink Max the best outdoor Bluetooth speaker overall. It has a rugged design built to withstand heavy use, floats in water so you can easily retrieve it if you drop it in the pool and it offers a stellar audio profile.\n\nBut the Bose may not fully suit your individual needs; if you\u2019re seeking something smaller, the Bose SoundLink Flex is a great mini speaker that\u2019s also built for the outdoors. Those who want a big, beefy boombox (with some fun karaoke features) should look at the Soundcore Rave 3S. But there are other high-quality options, too. Here are the best outdoor speakers my tech team and I tested and recommend.\n\u2022 You want a lighter, more portable Bluetooth speaker\n\nOf all of the Bluetooth speakers I\u2019ve tested recently, the Bose SoundLink Max is my top pick. It has a rugged design that\u2019s not only waterproof and dustproof\u2014it\u2019s also built to withstand accidental drops. Tack on the convenient swappable carry handle, and this speaker was designed to last in any kind of outdoor environment, whether you\u2019re taking it on your next picnic or to your next pool party. If you do accidentally drop it in water, it has flotation technology to help keep it afloat. You can\u2019t play music on it while it\u2019s in water, but the speaker bobs while you retrieve it. It also comes in color options in addition to black, including a lovely new citrus yellow.\n\nThe Bose SoundLink Max packs an impressive bass in a fairly compact package. It\u2019s a little heavy at around 4.9 pounds, but it\u2019s well worth that extra weight. The brand does a stellar job of packing deep basses into this small package, and it nails the EQ profile right out of the box. If you prefer a different EQ, you can adjust the bass, mids and trebles individually by six levels in either direction. If you prefer EQ presets, look elsewhere. That said, the app, and by proxy the EQ customizations, are easy to navigate, and that\u2019s a rather large boon. In my speaker testing, I\u2019ve experienced some clunky apps.\n\nThe SoundLink Max comes with multipoint connectivity, so you can connect two Bose speakers to one compatible device for more robust audio. That said, it only plays music in one direction, so don\u2019t expect omnidirectional playback. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that, after our testing, the SoundLink Max is also our best Bluetooth speaker in general as well as the best waterproof Bluetooth speaker you can get right now.\n\u2022 A budget of $100 or less\n\u2022 Rocking out in the shower\n\u2022 You want to control your EQ settings\n\nThe Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 may be a small speaker\u2014it\u2019s slightly larger than the palm of my hand\u2014but it manages to pack in an impressively large soundscape. It features a fully waterproof design and, like the Bose SoundLink Max, floats in water when accidentally dropped. Keep in mind that like the Bose, it also doesn\u2019t play music while floating in water. Additionally, unlike the Bose, the sound reduces somewhat when it gets fully wet.\n\nStill, for its price, it\u2019s a darn good Bluetooth speaker. It has three buttons on the speaker\u2019s top: a Bluetooth connection, an On/Off and a Play/Pause button. The plus and minus signs on the front adjust volume. It\u2019s very simple, but it\u2019s a design that I like because of its simplicity. It\u2019s not easy to press the wrong button when using this speaker. While you don\u2019t get any sound profiles or EQs, the audio is good out of the box. Its 360-degree audio has a great quality that balances the basses, mids and trebles well.\n\nThat said, there are some caveats to this Bluetooth speaker. I tested the speaker with both my iPhone 16 Pro and my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra when I read reports about faulty Android compatibility. Unfortunately, I experienced audio cutouts on my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. If you\u2019re team iPhone, this is a great affordable outdoor speaker. However, if you\u2019re team Android, I recommend opting for the best mini outdoor Bluetooth speaker pick, the Bose SoundLink Flex.\n\u2022 Its rugged build: Drop it, toss it, and it still works\n\u2022 You want more robust EQ presets\n\nIf you plan on frequently taking your outdoor Bluetooth speaker on the go, then you want a balance of good audio quality and a super rugged design. The JBL Charge 6 is the best at balancing these features: Its design feels nearly indestructible, and it\u2019s rated IP68, so it offers both waterproofing and dustproofing in addition to the sturdy build.\n\nThe speaker also offers a convenient removable carry handle that\u2019s easy to use, and I found it easy to carry it both around my home and through my local park. It weighs just 3 pounds, which helped make it my pick as the best portable outdoor Bluetooth speaker.\n\nDiving into the software, I found the JBL app to be one of the easiest I tested, but there\u2019s a slight caveat: There are technically two apps: JBL Portable and JBL Headphones. You want the former to adjust the EQ on your speaker. The software offers five EQS: JBL Signature, Chill, Energetic, Vocal and Custom. After testing, I personally recommend Energetic because it gave my music extra vibrancy, but if you don\u2019t feel like deep diving into the software, that\u2019s fine\u2014the audio quality sounds good right out of the box. I personally don\u2019t recommend using the app\u2019s AI Boost software, as it makes the music sound a little tinny, of which I wasn\u2019t a fan.\n\nYou can also connect another JBL Charge 6 speaker to enjoy a more robust audio. One of the reasons the JBL Charge 6 doesn\u2019t take the best overall pick spot is that while Bose speakers can connect to its siblings, the Charge 6 can\u2019t connect to, say, the JBL Flip 6.\n\nThe battery life can last up to 28 hours on a charge, but JBL thoughtfully considered that you still may forget to plug in your device and added a Playtime Boost feature. This feature makes the audio sound a tad more tinny, but it allowed me to eke out a few extra hours in a pinch. Depending on how low the battery life is when you do plug in, you can expect it to take up to three hours to recharge.\n\nStill, for those who plan to take their speaker on the go frequently, the JBL Charge 6 can also charge your phone, which is a super useful feature. Note that the speaker doesn\u2019t ship with a charging cable to reduce e-waste, so plan to pack a USB-C charger. I\u2019ve tested the Baseus Retractable USB-C Cable, and I recommend this for those short on space, but any cable will do.\n\u2022 Getting the most bass\u2014and fun LED flair\u2014at your next pool party\n\u2022 Using AI to enhance your karaoke sessions\n\nFor those who want to keep the party going late into the night, the Soundcore Rave 3S is a great option, according to tester and Forbes Vetted executive editor Dave Johnson. It weighs 23 pounds, so don\u2019t expect to take this too far from your backyard or camper. It also only has, \u201ca single handle on the top\u2014positioned in back so it tends to swing around when you walk with it,\u201d according to Johnson. The speaker also comes with fun light show settings that can be controlled from the accompanying app.\n\nThe sound quality is very good and has a, \u201cbeefy bass thanks to a 6.5-inch woofer\u2014something I appreciated when playing songs with a lot of bottom, like Jack White\u2019s new \u2018Archbishop Harold Holmes\u2019 or, in honor of Spinal Tap\u2019s 40th anniversary, \u2018Big Bottom.\u2019\u201d But it\u2019s not just the great audio quality that makes it our top boombox pick: It also doubles as a karaoke machine.\n\nThe Soundcore Rave 3S comes with a pair of microphones. An AI-powered vocal eraser removes the vocals from any song you play. It goes further: There are, \u201cseveral levels of removal to choose from, which is great if you want a little bit of a guide track to help you work your way through the song,\u201d says Johnson. You can also adjust how the microphones capture your voice to give your voice warm and right tones as well as adjust for the kind of room you\u2019re singing in.\n\nThe only gripe Johnson had? The 12-hour battery life. For its size and weight, he expected more battery life than what the speaker allowed for. There\u2019s also the charge time of six hours from a fully depleted battery. If you plan to use it for your weeklong camping trip, make sure you plug it in overnight so you can use it the next day.\n\u2022 Great balance across all audio frequencies, in a smaller package\n\u2022 You want more powerful bass\n\nIf the Bose SoundLink Max is too large for your taste, the Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen) delivers a similar soundscape in a much smaller package. It\u2019s built to take on the go, and comes with a small nylon strap to clip a carabiner, and it also floats if dropped in the water. Admittedly, it\u2019s a bit larger than my value pick, the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4, but it\u2019s still the best mini portable speaker on the market for a few reasons.\n\nSimply put, the audio quality on the 2nd Gen Bose SoundLink Flex is unparalleled at this size. Many speakers I tested that were this size produced a good audio quality, but the bass frequencies were too weak. The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 is technically smaller, and it balances the frequencies nicely. But the 2nd Gen SoundLink Flex takes it a step further, with customizable EQ settings to showcase those deep basses without overpowering the other frequencies. It doesn\u2019t quite hit the rumbling bass of the SoundLink Max, but it gets close enough that you don\u2019t notice.\n\nIt also uses what Bose calls \"PositionIQ technology\" to sense where the speaker is placed and automatically adjust according to its location. That said, I did have to adjust the EQs in the app to +3 for both the bass and the trebles to get my preferred audio profile. I attribute that, again, to its size: It\u2019s harder for subwoofers to nail those deep basses on a smaller speaker. Still, this quick fix was easy and it made it more worthwhile. Bose is going all-in on these small, portable speakers, and has launched more colors recently, including the citrus yellow color I tested and loved.\n\nLike the Bose SoundLink Max, the 2nd Gen SoundLink Flex can connect to multiple Bose SoundLink speakers for Stereo Mode. But note that its battery life is lower, at up to 12 hours playback, and its charging time takes a little longer at four hours. Don\u2019t expect to charge your phone from this speaker, either.\n\u2022 A balance of price and performance that delivers crisp notes\n\u2022 Those AI-powered extras will only annoy you\n\u2022 You want a longer battery life\u2014testing didn\u2019t fully live up to claims on certain settings\n\nEarlier this year, LG launched its latest XBoom lineup. Partnering with artist will.i.am, the company completely redesigned not only the speakers but both the sound software and hardware\u2014and it shows. The LG XBoom Bounce offers a great design with a built-in strap that tucks neatly behind the speaker. I wish it was retractable, but if you\u2019re slinging it over your shoulder or hanging it, it\u2019s suitable. Because it\u2019s a stretchy strap, I do question its longevity, but during testing I didn\u2019t experience any problems with it. On the front, there\u2019s an LED light strip that you can control in the LG ThinQ app. At the top, there\u2019s a special heart button you can program to listen to LG Radio+, playlists and more. The option to play radio is a great feature, and I wish more speakers offered it.\n\nBass sounds good without overwhelming the rest of the frequencies, and nails the treble notes without giving them that tinny effect. It also keeps notes crisp, and this was most apparent on Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s and Clairo\u2019s tracks. You can find a couple of different EQ presets, and I personally recommend the Bass Boost EQ or creating a \u201cdynamic\u201d setting in the following order: 3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3. You can also use an AI to optimize your music in real time, which reduces the crispness somewhat. I don\u2019t recommend using this feature.\n\nLike another speaker I tested, the Ultimate Ears Epicboom, the LG XBoom Bounce offers a remote Off switch via Bluetooth (not via the app). Or, if you\u2019re prone to forgetting to turn it off before leaving the house, you can control it with an automatic sleep timer. This does reduce the battery life, though, and it can\u2019t be used if its life is less than 20%. I also liked the AI-powered LED light feature, which \u201cdanced\u201d in real time to my music and offered a few different options including rotation, flickering and more. Supposedly, it also offers a Sound Boost feature, but I never did figure out where to find that despite spending a good 30 minutes digging into every single window in the app. Not that it really needs it, though, considering that even at half power, the audio carries well.\n\nLG claims that the speaker can last up to 30 hours on a single charge, which feels boastful. I noted during testing that after about two hours of blasting music at half volume (13 on the app), with Bass Boost on and the LED light strip set to Wave, the speaker reduced by 7% battery life. Another test I ran showed that the speaker reduced by 1% every nine minutes with my dynamic setting and the AI-powered LED light patterns used. Obviously, it probably can\u2019t reach 30 hours using all the features, but if you turn off the LED light strip and reduce the bass, you can eke out a few more hours.\n\u2022 The prospect of a wholly counterintuitive app annoys you\n\nThe Sonos Move 2 has one of the sleekest profiles to date. The white finish looks good on a bookshelf or on a patio, but it also comes in black and olive to mask scrapes if you\u2019re accident-prone. Its IP56 waterproof and dustproof rating isn\u2019t as robust as other options I tested. In short, the \u201c5\u201d means that dust can still enter the speaker, but it shouldn\u2019t cause issues or muddle the performance, while the \u201c6\u201d means that it can handle water jets blasted at it. Short of a Midwestern derecho or another borderline cataclysmic event, this should be sufficient for most needs\u2014just don\u2019t dunk it right in the water. I also appreciate the touch controls at the top, with the power button, Bluetooth button and microphone on/off switch located just under the handle.\n\nMy second biggest beef (more on my first in a minute) with the Sonos Move 2 was that when I originally booted it up, I couldn\u2019t tell whether it was on or off\u2014and that\u2019s still a big gripe. Other speakers dinged when they booted up, but this was one of the few that didn\u2019t notify me that it had turned on.\n\nAudio quality is impressive on this speaker, and it\u2019s this lovely sound that cements it as a premium pick. It sounds rich without muddling frequencies. And I loved how crisp the bass notes sounded in Panic! at the Disco\u2019s \u201cHey Look Ma, I Made It,\u201d and the Arcane soundtracks. There are two ways you can enhance your music. First, I opted to use Trueplay to \u201cregister\u201d where the speaker was in the room and adjust it to my space. Heads up: It sounds silly. It blasted loud laser noises throughout the room, as I paced the area and raised and lowered my phone to help create the space profile (you use your phone\u2019s microphone to help pinpoint locations).\n\nBut if you\u2019re not keen on using Trueplay, you can also use the EQs to adjust your sound. In the EQ window, I also found a Loudness booster. I highly recommend turning this on, as it gives the music extra depth, and it makes the speaker sound all the more luxe. This also rates as a premium pick due to the options to connect to Apple AirPlay 2 and voice commands by saying, \u201cHey Sonos.\u201d But it also offers Amazon Alexa integrations, which I found useful in my home, which is decked out down to my light bulbs. For those who have embraced the hands-free experience, this is the speaker to get.\n\nWhat\u2019s not so great about this speaker? The app. When I tested its sibling, the Roam 2, for the best Bluetooth speakers list, I griped about how unintuitive it feels, and that still holds up. Still, fans of the Sonos brand and those who are open to learning how to navigate the Sonos app may find that the perks of such great sound outweigh the cons of this app system.\n\nTo come up with our list of recommendations, our tech team tested over a dozen outdoor Bluetooth speakers. These outdoor Bluetooth speakers represent a good balance of audio quality, price and features, but didn\u2019t quite make the cut for one reason or another. Still, they\u2019re worthy of your consideration. Here are the other outdoor Bluetooth speakers we tested.\n\nAnker Soundcore Select 4 Go: (Forbes Vetted score: 8 out of 10): The Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go is a great speaker, and has consistently been one of my best value picks across many of my guides to Bluetooth speakers. It\u2019s a small speaker that manages to pack a large sound profile. That said, specifically for the great outdoors, the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 has a 360-degree sound and a better sound profile from a distance. It can also hit bass notes slightly better.\n\nBang & Olufsen BeoSound A1 (3rd Gen): (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): The Beosound A1 (3rd Gen) is a puck-shaped Bluetooth speaker that can be set on a table or hung using the leather cable strap. The audio quality is lovely, and the app is easy to navigate and adjust your EQs. For an outdoor Bluetooth speaker, the audio quality carries well. My biggest beefs lie in the design: It doesn\u2019t float in water, and the leather strap doesn\u2019t feel particularly sturdy. Still, this was my runner-up pick for a premium speaker due to its impressive audio profile.\n\nBose SoundLink Plus: (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): The Bose SoundLink Flex looks similar to its siblings in that it has the same silicone shell to protect against accidental drops. It also has the same waterproofing and dustproofing features, but I just couldn\u2019t get past the durable loop in lieu of the carry handle. It weighs slightly less than the Bose SoundLink Max, but the loop seems counterintuitive, and the Max\u2019s handle still feels like a smarter design choice. Still, its audio quality is on par with the Max and the Flex (2nd Gen), and it lands squarely between the two in terms of the price. It\u2019s a good blend for those who want more power without the higher price tag.\n\nUltimate Ears Everboom: (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): Of the 25+ speakers currently in my home, the Ultimate Ears Everboom is the one I keep returning to as my main. It has a lovely audio profile, and its vertical design looks great on any bookshelf or stand. Its 360-degree audio manages to fill my 850-square foot apartment, which is impressive considering its size. It also has a remote on/off switch in the app which quickly became my favorite feature of all the outdoor Bluetooth speakers I tested. But I noted when testing it that I kept having to re-pair it with my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Google Pixel 9 Pro when I turned it on.\n\nSonos Roam 2 : (Forbes Vetted Score: 7.5 out of 10): The Sonos Roam 2\u2019s compact build was a contender for the best mini speaker. I loved how the audio profile sounded; of all the small speakers I\u2019ve tested over the past few months. Automatic Truplay is also helpful to maximize the audio quality in any space, and if you have two, you can carry your sound to another Roam 2 speaker or Move 2 speaker in your home, which the brand calls \u201cSound Swap.\u201d But comparatively, its battery life is lower at around 10 hours, and there\u2019s also the app\u2014like the Move 2\u2019s, the app is very, very clunky.\n\nAnker Soundcore Boom 3i: (Forbes Vetted score: 7.5 out of 10): In a rare miss for the company, the Anker Soundcore Boom 3i has great sound \u2026 if you are directly in front of it. That unidirectional sound does punch above its weight, but it quickly falls apart when I moved around the speaker. The speaker features IP68 waterproofing, and it\u2019s built to be the most rugged option for the great outdoors. It also floats upward in water, so you can listen to your music while it stays in the pool, which is a unique feature. But still, I couldn\u2019t get past the unidirectional audio quality.\n\nLG Xboom Grab: (Forbes Vetted score: 8 out of 10): I love the design of the LG Xboom Grab: It has two convenient straps to hang the speaker, and the AI-powered LED lights add extra fun elements. The audio quality is good straight out of the box, too. That said, it only plays music in one direction, and so you shouldn\u2019t expect 360-degree audio.\n\nJBL Flip 7: (Forbes Vetted score: 8.5 out of 10): The JBL Flip 7 is pint-sized and offers a detachable clip. It also has a carry handle and the same software features as the Charge 6, including the AI Sound Boost setting and EQ presets. If you prefer to stay in the JBL family but want a small package, this is a great option. Just keep in mind that the Charge 6 has more powerful bass.\n\nHow I Tested The Best Outdoor Bluetooth Speakers\n\nTo find the best outdoor Bluetooth speakers, I put over a dozen speakers to the test, narrowing down the devices to top-rated brands like Bose, Anker Soundcore and more. From there, I put my shortlist to extensive testing.\n\nI compared each speaker\u2019s IP rating, aiming for at least IP66 to handle beach days or unexpected rainstorms during your backyard barbecue. I hit them with my kitchen faucet\u2019s spray nozzle and dropped the float-claiming models into a sink, and noted any changes in audio performance.\n\nI reviewed weight and dimensions, then evaluated how easy each speaker was to grab and carry. I considered the location of straps and handles. I also looked into whether the Bluetooth speakers I tested offered any built-in flotation.\n\nThis was where the bulk of my testing came into play. No matter what genre you\u2019re listening to, your audio quality should have a good balance of bass, mids and treble frequencies. None of these frequencies should sound muddled or distorted during listening sessions, and so I looked for crystal-clear clarity and smoothness among the frequencies. I cross-checked audio quality in each Bluetooth speaker across a variety of songs, and I considered differences across multiple EQs, speaker direction and more. I also checked how far the speaker reached, placing it on the opposite end of my large living room and seeing how each speaker sounded as the audio projected.\n\nSome of the genres that I listen to include alternative, rock, classical, audiobooks/podcasts and more. Specifically, some of the songs I tested each pair of Bluetooth speakers include:\n\u2022 Florence + the Machine\u2019s \u201cKing,\u201d \u201cCosmic Love\u201d and \u201cDog Days Are Over\u201d\n\u2022 Fitz and the Tantrums\u2019 \u201c123456,\u201d \u201cLivin\u2019 For The Weekend\u201d and \u201cI Just Wanna Shine\u201d\n\u2022 Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cDNA,\u201d \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d \u201ctv off (feat. lefty gunplay)\u201d and \u201cluther (with sza)\u201d\n\u2022 The entire soundtracks to seasons one and two of the Netflix show Arcane\n\nI played each speaker for 30-minute sessions at different volumes and frequencies, logging start and end battery percentages. I also tested any quick-charge or portable USB-C charging features to see which models truly live up to their claims.\n\nThe Forbes Vetted team has published hundreds of that leverage our hands-on testing and research, including for all of your listening needs like , , and more.\n\u2022 Consumer tech and electronics editor has been involved in tech journalism for over six years. In her time testing the best outdoor Bluetooth speakers, she focused on aspects of interest to everyone, from casual, occasional listening to serious audiophiles who want to enjoy every single guitar strum across a truly balanced EQ.\n\u2022 We also tapped an expert to share his unbiased insights for this story: Nikolay Petrov, chief technology officer at Zontsound, an audio and sound repair guide.\n\u2022 We regularly review our content to ensure our recommendations are still the best of the best. We first published this article in August 2025 to retest all contenders.\n\nHow To Choose An Outdoor Bluetooth Speaker\n\nAs you shop for the best outdoor Bluetooth speaker for your needs, there are five key aspects you should focus on before you decide: portability, durability, sound quality, battery life and price.\n\nIf you plan to take your Bluetooth speaker on the go, you should look for one \u201cthat\u2019s easy to carry, with a strap or a hook,\u201d Petrov says. Typically, the lighter a Bluetooth speaker is, the easier it is to pack in your bag. A heavier speaker, like my boombox pick, the Soundcore Rave 3S, is typically built for your backyard patio rather than taking to the beach.\n\nEspecially if you pack your Bluetooth speaker along, consider a rugged design that\u2019s protected against bumps and scrapes. For outdoor speakers in particular, also consider other factors like weatherproofing.\n\nThe IP rating of a speaker is either followed by one letter and one number or two numbers. The first digit indicates how well it handles smaller particles like dust, and the higher that number, the more resistant it is. The second number refers to how well protected the speaker is against water. But, Petrov shares, \u201cKeep in mind that IPX ratings are usually only about water protection, and even those aren\u2019t constant. IPX7 means waterproof, but IPX4 probably only tolerates splashes.\u201d He goes on to add that, \u201cWith IP67, you get full dust protection and water immersion to one meter for up to 30 minutes.\u201d If you\u2019re taking your outdoor speaker to the pool or beach, that\u2019s a must-have, in case you accidentally knock it into the water.\n\nIdeally, Petrov recommends \u201cIP67 for outdoor use (tough enough to withstand a hike in rain, sitting on sand or falling into water),\u201d so you can enjoy your music without worry. That said, if you plan to contend with just an occasional splash or are mindful of potential rainstorms, you can get away with a Bluetooth speaker rated IPX4 and above.\n\nAudio quality is one of the most important aspects to an outdoor Bluetooth speaker. It\u2019s not just about achieving a rich audio quality across all frequencies, but you also have to consider your audio\u2019s dispersion, according to Petrov. He adds, \u201c360-degree speakers are good for communal events like barbecues, whereas directional speakers are better for solo hikes or hanging out by the pool.\u201d Ultimately, he recommends choose a form based on your specific lifestyle and needs.\n\nAdditionally, make sure the sound carries well across an outdoor space and at higher volumes. Look for a Bluetooth speaker that can remain balanced or offers a balancing feature, like an AI-powered EQ or a \u201cscanning\u201d feature, to make sure you have good audio quality at all volume levels and spaces. Petrov shares that another must-have is a \u201ccustom EQ option. It\u2019s especially important for the outdoors, where the bass can be lost and the trebles can be harsh.\u201d\n\nA long battery life may be a feature to prioritize, especially if you plan to spend all day outdoors. \u201cI make sure I get at least 12 hours of playtime, with USB-C charging,\u201d says Petrov. All of the speakers we tested offer at least 12 hours, but generally, the longer it can last, the better. There\u2019s also the question of charging: If you forget to charge, a speaker should offer a quick-time charging where five minutes gets you another hour, or something to that effect.\n\nAnother plus that\u2019s started to be offered by some outdoor Bluetooth speakers is the ability to charge your phone. A couple of my top picks offer this so you can charge your phone in a pinch. If you\u2019re prone to regularly letting your phone get below 20%, you may also want to consider this feature.\n\nAn outdoor Bluetooth speaker can cost anywhere from less than $50 to nearly $2,000, however, most options I tested and considered for this list land between $100 to $400. As with most speakers, you can expect more more premium features and higher-quality sound with a higher price tag, although you don\u2019t need to overspend to get a stellar Bluetooth speaker. I found in my testing that you can reliably get a good balance of audio quality and features for the price around the $200 to $400 mark.",

  "summary": "The Bose SoundLink Max is the best outdoor Bluetooth speaker overall, with a rugged design, floats in water when dropped, and offers a stellar audio profile. However, the Bose Flex is a smaller mini speaker that is also designed for outdoor use. The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 may be a small but packs in an impressive large soundscape. The Soundcore Rave 3S is also a high-quality boombox, but there are also high-demand options. The Bose soundLink Max comes with multipoint connectivity and can connect two Bose speakers to one compatible device for more robust audio. The waterproof SoundLink Flex has flotation technology to keep it afloat when dropped in water, but it doesn't play music while floating in water. Despite some caveats, I recommend the Soundcore 3S for both iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.",

      "text": "Wired headphones are all but extinct. Wireless headphones have become the norm for most people who want to listen in private while on the go, shutting out the din that surrounds them whether it\u2019s on the train or in the office. But as Forbes Vetted\u2019s consumer tech editor\u2014and a classically trained musician\u2014I know it takes more than just a long battery life and decent audio to separate the good from the very best. After rigorously testing 24 pairs, our team\u2019s top pick for the best wireless headphones is the Bose QuietComfort Ultra: They feature gorgeous, rich audio that\u2019s easy to adjust, and they feel comfortable to wear for hours after multiple transatlantic flights.\nAnd there are other great models too, such as those for fitness enthusiasts, audiophiles and Apple users. For casual listeners who don\u2019t want to spend a fortune, the Soundcore Space Ones ring in at around $100 and bring surprisingly good audio quality. After weeks of our rigorous testing, these are the eight best wireless headphones you can buy. (And if you\u2019re looking specifically for earbuds, check out my roundup of the best wireless earbuds we selected after testing 24 top models.)\nIntuitively Designed And Durable Through Constant Wear\nThe headphones are a blend of aluminum and plastic and feel a little flimsy, but don\u2019t let that sway you. I usually loop them onto my bulky carry-on purse during transit; after a number of accidental drops, they still look like I bought them yesterday. The build has swappable plush ear cups that have held up to a year of constant wear. They\u2019re very comfortable over plane rides as long as 10 hours. The buttons feel like they\u2019re intuitively placed, too. One change from its predecessor, the Bose QuietComfort 45s: Instead of physical touch volume buttons, the left ear cup uses a touch swipe control; swipe up or down to increase or reduce volume. Some folks may find this off-putting, and your mileage may vary here.\nUnparalleled Audio Quality Despite Minimal EQ Adjustments\nTrue audiophiles may find that the Bose app leaves something to be desired; during testing, I found that the EQ adjustments are very minimal. You can tune your bass, mids and trebles up to six points in either direction, but that\u2019s it. It feels very intentional\u2014Bose has a unique approach to audio that\u2019s consistent across all its audio products, including the Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless earbuds, the Bose Soundlink Flex and the Bose Soundlink Max, based on my testing of all three products. That\u2019s not a knock against the brand\u2014Bose\u2019s audio quality is unparalleled at this price range. I also have a massive issue with many different presets on the competition. Many of them sound muddled or outright bizarre in my ears; to date, I haven\u2019t experienced this issue with Bose.\nBattery Life Lasts Up To 24 Hours\nBattery life is also stellar. I\u2019ve taken them on multiple flights, including a 13-hour international flight, and they lasted me the whole time. They\u2019re rated for a 24-hour battery life with ANC on; when immersion mode is also turned on, you lose some of that 24 hours. A quick 15-minute charge also gave me another two hours in a pinch.\nUnderwhelming Head-Tracking Feature\nThe Bose headphones offer both stationary and immersive head-tracking modes, called Still and Motion, respectively: Still puts your soundstage in front of where your head is positioned; turn left and right and the audio shifts so it stays front and center. Motion keeps you immersed for when you\u2019re on the move. These features are nice in theory, but they come at the cost of audio quality, and you can hear a noticeable audio degradation when enabled. This happened across every single pair of wireless headphones I tested, which points to a bigger problem with this technology. But if you don\u2019t plan to use this software, it won\u2019t matter to you, anyway.\nTwo Years Later: Still Worth It Despite Some Glitches\nAfter testing these since they launched in October 2023, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are still the top pick, but there are some minor things to note. I\u2019ve tested them across multiple mobile devices, and sometimes the headphones don\u2019t want to pair with all my Android devices. The Bluetooth connection will claim it\u2019s paired, but then they\u2019ll turn off. It\u2019s an easy fix: Just restart the headphones and they should repair to your device.\nThe 2025 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.\nQuality Audio That Punches Well Above Its Price\nThe Space One headphones outshone some of the midrange options I tested. The bass feels strong without feeling overpowering, and it balances out the mids and trebles really well. I also attribute this to a slew of EQ presets, but these really aren\u2019t needed. Soundcore hits the nail on the head with its Soundcore Signature option. You can adjust for various listening experiences, from podcasts to hip hop, rap and more; if you want to swap EQs, they all sound lovely.\nWorth The $100 Price Tag, Despite Frivolous Extras\nHowever, some of the software in the accompanying app feels frivolous. You can test your hearing Via HearID Sound, for example, and review six different audio \u201cthis or that\u201d EQs to find your best match. If you have sharp hearing, this won\u2019t matter much to you; during my testing, I ran the test twice. The first time I responded as if I could hear almost every frequency ping, and then I did it again in which I pretended I couldn\u2019t hear some of the frequencies.\nAfter the first test, there was no discernible difference in how the headphones performed. After the second test, the headphones seemed to boost some of the higher frequencies, which I found interesting since I specifically claimed I couldn\u2019t hear the lower ones.\nCheap Materials Are This Pair\u2019s Biggest Downfall\nAdmittedly, for the price, the design feels lightweight and cheaply built\u2014and that\u2019s my main knock against these headphones. Most of the others on this list feature higher-quality materials, and the plastic and pleather on these headphones feels subpar. Many of my picks also allow you to seamlessly swap ear cups, but the Space Ones don\u2019t appear to have this feature. But despite the downfalls, I found these headphones hard to beat given the $100 price tag.\nSeven Months Later: Still Superb Despite Some Minor Flaws\nAfter seven months of testing, the Anker Soundcore Space Ones hold up pretty darn well. The flimsy material has held up surprisingly well: They still look brand new despite using them frequently for trekking around New York City. While I\u2019ve determined the ANC could be stronger, it\u2019s still good enough that they mute a good chunk of outside noise when I\u2019m reading at home or walking around the city.\nAfter testing the best wireless earbuds for several months, I found that there\u2019s no clear-cut winner; simply put, you won\u2019t find a one-size-fits all pair of earbuds. But if you\u2019re looking for one that gets very close\u2014with good audio quality, decent noise cancellation and battery life and more\u2014the Technics EAZ-AH100 Wireless Earbuds should be your go-to pair. Let me explain.\nA Solid Build With Stellar Audio Quality\nThe earbuds are built of a sturdy aluminum and plastic blend. After dropping them multiple times and dragging them practically everywhere for three months, they still look brand new. As an audiophile, the most important feature to me is the audio quality, and the Technics nail the audio profile out of the box. Simply put, it\u2019s stellar; if you don\u2019t want to adjust them, you don\u2019t need to, but I personally recommend the Dynamic mode to hit the deep bass on some of my testing tracks. If you thrive on a heavy bass, the earbuds have two different settings for you, Bass Boost and Super Bass Boost.\nStill, one of the big drawbacks is that the earbuds don\u2019t nail the ANC as the Bose Comfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds I tested (not to be confused with our top headphones pick, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Headphones). It\u2019s still strong enough that these earbuds have become my go-to pair\nBattery Life Lasts Long Listening Sessions\nSome context here: While many of the wireless headphones that top this list can last for up to two dozen hours, earbuds are notably deficient in this category. Even some of the top earbuds I tested for this category, including the Apple AirPods Pro 2 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds, only last up to six hours with ANC on. The Technics buck that trend and can last an impressive 10 hours with ANC on before requiring a recharge. Additionally, the included charging case boosts listening time to 28 hours. The latter number is on par with most charging cases.\nANC Is Its Biggest Drawback\nRemember how I mentioned that typically there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all in earbuds? The sacrifice here is the ANC, and it\u2019s my biggest complaint about this pair. I\u2019ve tested them in loud spaces and made adjustments to try to maximize noise reduction. While they effectively eliminate the sounds of schoolchildren playing outside my home, when I took them on the subway and a few plane flights, they didn\u2019t adequately eliminate ambient noise. It\u2019s good enough for most needs, but those that want the absolute best ANC will need to look elsewhere.\nRich, Balanced Audio Production, But ANC Is Slightly Lacking\nThe Sonos Ace headphones produce rich, balanced audio. Our tester noted that over the course of several months, the audio quality favored clarity and quality over punch. They\u2019re on par with the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in terms of audio quality, but ANC is where Bose pulls ahead. The ANC on the Sonos Ace headphones is good, and it\u2019s easy to toggle between ANC and awareness modes. In everyday environments, they\u2019re fine; in noisier situations like traveling in an airplane or hanging out in a bustling cafe, they\u2019re \u201cjust a shade below excellent,\u201d one of our testers notes. Another tester shared that when comparing the Ace\u2019s ANC with the Apple AirPods Max, the latter has more powerful ANC, but just barely.\n20-Hour Battery Life With Option For Wired Listening\nThe battery life holds up to the 20-hour claim, and they charge fairly quickly. For those who want them to look their best as long as possible, Sonos includes a sturdy case with a USB-C to 3.5mm cable for wired listening, too.\nAbility To Stream Audio From Your Arc Soundbar\nIf you\u2019re already a Sonos fan and have the Sonos Arc, the Ace headphones pair seamlessly so you can watch TV and have the audio from your Arc soundbar stream through your Ace headphones. For parents, this is a game changer: You can enjoy a couple minutes of your favorite shows without disrupting nap time. One tester says, \u201cI have a toddler and a newborn, and it\u2019s nice to be able to watch TV with my headphones on when they\u2019re napping so I don\u2019t disturb them.\u201d But outside the Sonos integrations, other software features fall short.\nSeven Months Later: No Complaints\nAfter several months of wear and tear, the Sonos Ace still look brand new, with our tester sharing that they have experienced, \u201cnegligible wear and tear.\u201d While there have been a few updates, which is typical for any pair of headphones, the pairing is still seamless, and the main draw is still the high-fidelity audio quality and the ability to pair to the Sonos Arc soundbar for when our tester\u2019s baby is sleeping.\nSound Personalization For Crisp Audio Quality\nOur tester noted that they were \u201cextremely crisp and clear with a punchy but not overly aggressive bass,\u201d for a balanced, rich listening experience. They feature sound personalization that acts like a hearing test by beeping sounds in your ears. To work, you need to give real time feedback in the app; in short, it\u2019s testing your sensitivity to volume and tones to build a personal sound profile. If you\u2019re not happy with the personalized results, you can also adjust five different frequently levels. It\u2019s really nice, and while it\u2019s detailed, it\u2019s not overly complicated. For serious audiophiles, it comes with AAC, aptX, aptX Adaptive and SBC Bluetooth codecs.\nANC Is Less Impressive\nANC fell short, put simply. It has three ANC modes: transparent, soft and silent. When our tester sat in his office, he could hear his TV\u2019s audio down the hall\u2014and he felt that comparatively, his new pair of Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) canceled noise better than these headphones. These closed-back headphones are also designed to sound more realistic and have much better sound quality than open-back models. That improved sound quality makes them the top pair if you simply want a gorgeous listening experience. Just be prepared to pay a very, very high price for them.\nIncredible ANC, Just Plan To Tune Your Sound\nOur tester notes that the ANC on this pair of headphones is \u201cby far the best noise-cancelling headphones\u201d she\u2019s ever used: \u201cIf I have my music blasting there is truly nothing else I can hear.\u201d But, if you need to hear what\u2019s around you, it\u2019s easy to enable other modes to hear ambient sounds.\nHowever, Be prepared for the audio to not be very impressive straight out of the box and plan to spend a few minutes tuning these cans to your personal preferences. The good news is that Sony offers a robust equalizer so you can fine tune your audio to your desired balance or use one of the Sony presets.\n30-Hour Battery Life Plus Power-Saving Features\nBattery life is also impressive: While our tester used them daily for two weeks, she only had to charge them once. When battery life hits 5%, the headphones notify you so you can get to a charger. And, if you charge them for three minutes, you get another 90 minutes of playback in a pinch. There\u2019s also an automatic pause feature that registers when you remove the headphones and pauses your music, and, if you don\u2019t turn them on after a certain amount of time, shuts them off to save battery life.\nSpotty Connectivity To Certain Devices\nOur tester reports that while connecting to her iPhone 15 Pro was easy, connecting to a laptop took a little extra work. Once connected, though, the pair swapped between the phone and laptop with ease. She does note that every so often, the headphones would disconnect and require a quick software \u201crepair.\u201d It was never the end of the world, and it didn\u2019t happen enough that it detracted from the whole experience.\nImmersive Listening With Strong ANC\nThe audio quality on the headphones left our tester impressed, with an immersive listening experience that offers spatial audio and a strong ANC. It\u2019s so good, she reports that it\u2019s nearly impossible to hear her vacuum through the headphones when she\u2019s cleaning\u2014only a slight hum can be heard. It also offers a Transparency mode that\u2019s easy to swap to when you need to hear the outside world. For audiophiles, you can manually customize the EQ under the music settings on your iPhone, but odds are you\u2019ll be able to leave it as is or only make minor adjustments: The EQ that the AirPods Max offers during setup is so good that our tester kept the audio quality as is.\nSeamless Multi-Point Connectivity\nThe multi-point connectivity for iPhone and Mac users is also arguably the best on the market. If you\u2019re listening on your iPhone, you can turn on your MacBook and it seamlessly swaps to listening on your preferred device of choice. The same goes for when you shut your MacBook and want to listen on your iPhone: The headphones register that you want to listen on your mobile device and swap to using that for listening to music.\nNot Fully \u201cOff\u201d Unless They\u2019re In Their Case\nOur biggest beef lies not in the headphones itself but the carrying case and its relation to the battery life. If you don\u2019t place them in the case, they don\u2019t fully turn off, instead shifting to a sleep mode. This sleep mode still drains battery life; if you don\u2019t use them for a long period of time, you may find yourself placing a pair of dead headphones on your head.\nThree Years Later: Some Minor Aesthetic Wear And Tear\nOur tester has owned her pair of Apple AirPods Max for three years now, and for the most part, they\u2019ve held up well. The headphones have \u201cmanaged to withstand me dropping them and only sustaining a few minor scratches.\u201d But while there are some scratches, it\u2019s the headband itself that has seen the most wear and tear: During long-term testing, the mesh on the headband has lost some of its elasticity, and it\u2019s noticeable. It doesn\u2019t detract from the function, but it\u2019s something to note if you\u2019re very mindful of aesthetics.\nDesigned To Stay Firmly In Place\nYou get five ear tips to help you keep the headphones securely tucked into your ears. The ultimate secure-fit ear hooks also help keep them firmly in place, too. The design makes them very appealing for fitness enthusiasts because no matter how much I ran, jumped and walked, they stayed firmly on my ears.\nImproved Audio But Lacks EQ Customization\nThe audio is pretty good, and based on my audio tests, I felt it significantly improved over the original Powerbeats Pro model. Considering these were designed to balance fitness and your audio, I was pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. It\u2019s not the best, but it\u2019s certainly good enough for most needs. Just make sure you use the ear tip test found in the app to check for a good fit. Had I not completed this test, my audio quality would have suffered immensely. The ANC could be stronger, but it\u2019s just a nice extra\u2014so long as they stay snugly on my ears, to me, that\u2019s the more important feature about these headphones.\nMy absolute biggest gripe\u2014and admittedly, to my horror\u2014these headphones do not come with any kind of EQ customizations, only an Adaptive EQ. As someone who constantly tweaks audio settings on the fly for my preferences, I felt that Beats believed they knew what was best for me\u2014and I strongly disagree with this sentiment. I would love to see Beats introduce an EQ in the future.\nHeart-Tracking Monitor Only Works With Certain Apps\nOne interesting thing to note: It\u2019s the first pair of headphones to include a heart-tracking monitor, but it only works with certain apps like Peleton, Nike Run Club, Ladder and Open. Ideally, you\u2019ll also have an iPhone since it seamlessly syncs up with the iPhone ecosystem and the iPhone Health app; if you\u2019re an Android user, download the Beats app. This iOS versus Android issue also comes into play with the heart monitor. You need to manually start it and stop it on Android, while iPhone users will have it automatically register and you can track it in real time.\nIs it necessary to have a heart monitor on a pair of headphones? No, but it\u2019s a pretty neat feature if you leave your smartwatch at home or it dies during your workout. And keep in mind that if you have a smartwatch, those readings will always trump the earbuds\u2019 readings. The sensors on your smartwatch will be more accurate and come with extras like arrhythmia detection. But if you have a smartwatch, it\u2019s frivolous since you can garner that information with a glance at your wrist. Ultimately, you\u2019ll need to decide if this feature is worth it.\nOther Wireless Headphones We Tested\nWe tested a ton of different headphones\u201424, to be exact. These ones didn\u2019t make the cut, but we detail below why they\u2019re still worthy of your consideration.\nJBL Live 770 NC (Forbes Vetted score: 7 out of 10): The JBL Live 770 NC headphones have a strong bass that give all the genres we tested across\u2014folk, rock, pop and more\u2014a nice depth that we really liked. However, the ANC wasn\u2019t as strong as other contenders: \u201cI could still hear the mumbles of people around me and the treadmill\u2019s motor when I was working out,\u201d notes our tester, who also observed minor creaking in the headset and pinching behind her ears when she wore glasses.\nBeats Studio Pro (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): The audio quality feels exceptional on the Beats Studio Pro, as does the ANC: It drowned out external noise on a transcontinental flight, and our tester nearly missed the pilot\u2019s announcements unless she kept the volume low. Battery life is also pretty stellar; after testing, they lasted around 38 hours out of the claimed 40 hours of playback time. However, while the ear cups feel comfortable and well padded, the headband didn\u2019t\u2014and on that same flight, our tester reports she \u201chad to shift their position atop my head a few times to relieve pressure.\u201d\nJLab Go Lux ANC (Forbes Vetted score: 7 out of 10): To be frank, these were my personal favorite for a budget pick. The audio is stunning, and they felt comfortable enough that I wore them for multiple hours without any ear aches. The battery life is also impressive. My minor gripes: The build quality feels a little too cheap, and you won\u2019t get the automatic play/pause feature that\u2019s built into other JLab headphones. Still, for the price, I really enjoyed these; I would recommend them for teens.\nSony WH-1000XM5 (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): The Sony WH-1000XM5s are a pretty sturdy pair of headphones, and after hours of continuous wear, they felt comfortable on our tester\u2019s ears. He also notes that the ANC is as strong as the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. In a blind test, however, the audio quality of the Bose outperformed that of the Sony headphones with and without ANC. We also felt that the app controls were clunky.\nBowers & Wilkins Px8 (Forbes Vetted score: 8 out of 10): As audiophiles, we found the audio quality superb, with a \u201cstudio-level fidelity,\u201d according to our tester. The accompanying app has a comprehensive EQ as well as voice assistant support, and they\u2019re comfortable to wear for long periods of time. There\u2019s also support for aptX Adaptive, aptX HD, AAC and SBC, as well as direct PC audio streaming via a USB-C connection. That said, they\u2019re very, very expensive at around $500, and that\u2019s on sale. (Read our full review of the Px7, the previous version for an inside look at its pros and cons.)\nAnker Soundcore Space One Pro (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): The Anker Soundcore Space One Pros are simply lovely, and like the budget-friendly Space Ones, they offer a slew of features including Dolby Audio, HearID Sound and a library of EQ presets. The audio quality beat our midrange pick\u2014except for the Dolby Audio setting, which muddies the audio. They were also edged out by the Sony ULT Wears in terms of durability. Lastly, the ear cups are not replaceable, and the cream white color is prone to catching dirt marks.\nAnker Soundcore Life Q35 (Forbes Vetted score: 7 out of 10): Our tester loves these headphones for their slightly oversized earcup with generous padding. It\u2019s so good that when cross-testing them against the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones, she preferred to wear this pair. The ANC and audio quality isn\u2019t as good as the Space Ones, however.\nJLab Epic Lux Lab Edition (Forbes Vetted score: 7.5 out of 10): I really liked these headphones when I used them on certain settings. That said, I noticed audio quality changes as I shifted through the various EQs, as well as when I turned on the spatial audio. They also feature an automatic play/pause feature, unlike the Go Lux ANC. They felt very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, too. But for the price, I felt it could be better.\nBeyerdynamic Aventho 300 (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): Out of all my testing, the Beyerdynamic Aventho 300s landed in my top three picks, just after Bose and Sonos. If you\u2019re going to use any EQ preset, I recommend the Dynamic and reduce the bass by just a hair; the other presets sounded way too muddled for me to truly enjoy the harp and bass on Florence & The Machine tracks. The noise canceling is a little weaker compared with the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, though. Otherwise, these headphones were stellar, and they just didn\u2019t fit into any category.\nBeats Solo 4 (Forbes Vetted score: 8 out of 10): The audio quality is really impressive for the $130 price tag. Our tester notes, \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m in the same room as my favorite podcast hosts when I\u2019m wearing these.\u201d The battery life is also a massive 50 hours. However, our tester reports that the Solo 4s don\u2019t seamlessly jump for a multi-point connection and only offers passive noise cancellation.\nAudio Technics A800 (Forbes Vetted score: 8.5 out of 10): For a $200 price tag, the Audio Technics output a detailed sound\u2014but not as detailed as the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Still, they\u2019re good enough for those who want a solid headset without dropping $400-plus. Ashnikko\u2019s music gave bassy punches but at times it sounded ever-so-slightly muddled. Florence and The Machine\u2019s \u201cFree\u201d also sounded muddled on these headphones. I also felt the app\u2019s EQ presets could have been more balanced.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nOur editorial team consists of tech experts who live to research, test, report (and, in the case of executive editor Dave Johnson, write multiple books) on all things digital.\n- Forbes Vetted\u2019s consumer tech team has also built a robust library of guides specifically for audio, including the best gaming headsets and the best Bluetooth speakers.\n- This story was authored by consumer tech editor Rebecca Isaacs, who oversees tech content for Forbes Vetted. She\u2019s been writing about tech for over six years, specializing in home entertainment and audio.\n- Most of our top picks, including the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds and the Anker Soundcore Space Ones, were personally tested by Isaacs. She has direct, hands-on experience with every contender on this list, too.\n- We continuously research any new releases or newly upgraded models of bestsellers, as well as comb through customer reviews and forums, comparing features commonly highlighted to those of models we\u2019ve tested.\n- We consulted outside sound and audio experts for their insights on what top features to evaluate when shopping: Michael B\u00f6hringer, Beyerdynamic\u2019s head of product marketing; Thomas Terronez, CEO of Medix Dental IT; and Jason Wingate, tech entrepreneur and CEO of Emerald Ocean Ltd.\n- Based on our experts\u2019 feedback, we gathered firsthand testing insights from Forbes Vetted staffers who\u2019ve used these headphones for at least 20 hours or more.\n- We recently retested and rescored every pair of wireless headphones on this list as recently as February 2025 to keep our recommendations and guidance fresh. This story was last reviewed and updated in July 2025 by Isaacs to add a new best wireless earbuds pick, the Technics EAH-AZ100 wireless earbuds, and refresh our recommendations on how to pick a pair of wireless headphones.\nHow We Tested The Best Wireless Headphones\nWhile I personally tested many of our best wireless headphones picks, I also enlisted fellow Forbes Vetted team members to help review some of the 24 contenders. We paired them to our mobile phones and spent hours streaming a slew of genres from Spotify, Apple Music and more. The biggest factors when using a pair of headphones\u2014sound quality, noise cancellation and overall design\u2014were our top priorities, but we also assessed key features such as multi-device connectivity, app functionality, comfort and battery life.\nSound Quality\nWe paid close attention to how the bass, mids and highs performed individually, focusing on high-end clarity (like high vocals or whistle instruments) and deep, resonant low-end frequencies (like bass and percussion). To ensure well-rounded testing, we listened to as many genres as possible, in addition to podcasts. Some of the songs we we used to test each pair of wireless headphones with included:\n- Florence and the Machine\u2019s \u201cKing,\u201d \u201cCosmic Love,\u201d \u201cChoreomania\u201d and \u201cDog Days Are Over\u201d\n- Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s \u201cScheherazade\u201d\n- Ashnikkos\u2019 \u201cWorms\u201d and \u201cDaisy\u201d\n- Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe\u201d and \u201cRed Wine Supernova\u201d\n- Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cThe Chain\u201d\n- Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cluther (with sza),\u201d \u201ctv off (feat. lefty gunplay),\u201d and \u201cNot Like Us\u201d\n- The entire soundtracks to seasons one and two of the Netflix show Arcane\n- Multiple Morbid and Crime Junkie podcast episodes\nThis roster of songs and artists gave us a well-rounded picture of the performance and range each pair of headphones could deliver. We also deep-dived into the companion apps designed to customize audio, evaluating how advanced\u2014or limited\u2014their EQ settings were.\nNoise Cancellation\nFor headphones with active noise cancellation, we tested headphones in our apartments, in taxis, on the NYC MTA subway system and on multiple transcontinental flights. We also had spouses, children and cats try to communicate with us while wearing them to see whether conversations or pet cries could be blocked out.\nWe wore each pair for several hours to gauge the comfort of both earcups and the headband\u2014a feature that plays a large role in effective ANC. We reviewed whether the headphones feature passive or active noise cancellation, tried out any transparency modes and tested their effectiveness in each of the aforementioned environments.\nDesign And Durability\nBeyond sound and noise cancellation, we examined each headphone\u2019s design, build quality and overall durability. We took weight into account\u2014after all, the heavier it is on your head, the less comfortable it may be to wear for long periods\u2014as well as whether the headphones were water-resistant. In testing, we also checked the earcups, considering their plushness and gauged how comfortable they felt to wear for hours on end.\nBattery Life\nTo test battery life, we ran two tests. The first test, we kept ANC off and listened to music for 30 minutes, noting the battery life before and after the 30-minute mark. The second time, we turned on ANC and listened to music for 30 minutes, noting the battery life percentage before and after. This way we could calculate how long a battery lasted on each setting and cross-check each brand\u2019s claims. We could also get a sense of the battery life in a real-world setting for users.\nHow To Shop For The Best Wireless Headphones\nWe consulted several audio technology experts to outline the top features you should consider when picking up your next pair of wireless headphones. Here\u2019s what to consider when you\u2019re looking for your next pair.\nAudio Quality\nSound quality should be your most important factor above all else, according to Wingate. \u201cClarity, bass response and balance all come into play. Clarity ensures that you hear every detail in the audio,\u201d he says. A good bass response can deliver those deep, low-end beats for certain genres; he recommends looking for models that can reach as low as 20Hz. Wingate also stresses maintaining an even distribution across frequencies so that \u201cno single frequency overwhelms the others.\u201d That\u2019s important: You want your audio to feel balanced.\nAdvanced Audio Features\nAudiophiles seeking high-quality audio fidelity should look for certain advanced codecs, including LDAC, aptX and AAC. LDAC is Sony\u2019s high-bitrate Bluetooth codec that focuses on streaming high-quality, lossless audio for a more immersive listening experience, while aptX is Qualcomm\u2019s software for lower latency and clearer audio reproduction via audio file compression and decompression. What you use depends on your preferences, but in general, audiophiles should use at least one of these codecs. \u201cLDAC offer high-resolution audio, while aptX improves sound quality and reduces latency,\u201d Wingate explains.\nFor Apple users, look for Apple\u2019s homegrown Advanced Audio Codec support: \u201cAAC is optimized for Apple devices. Audiophiles will notice the difference, but casual listeners might not,\u201d Wingate adds. AAC seeks to balance efficient compression with strong fidelity, and so it\u2019s typically the go-to codec for iPhone users.\nComfort And Durability\nFrequent travelers and commuters need a pair of headphones that can be worn for long periods of time but also can withstand bumps and scrapes. Terronez notes, \u201cPlanes are loud and uncomfortable. Some headphones get too hot or can clamp too hard around your head.\u201d Make sure you look for one that has plenty of reports of being comfortable to wear for long hours. The good news is that all the picks on our best wireless headphones list feel comfortable to wear for long listening sessions.\nFor build quality, B\u00f6hringer recommends metal-reinforced hinges: \u201c[This] ensures it can withstand the wear and tear of being tossed in bags, dropped or subjected to sudden movements without breaking,\u201d he explains."

      "text": "As you\u2019re packing for your next pool party, a waterproof Bluetooth speaker can play music for hours and can withstand not only splashes, but also accidental immersion in water. After researching and testing over a dozen units, I found the Bose SoundLink Max to be the best waterproof Bluetooth speaker you can buy. It\u2019s fully waterproof, has a lovely audio quality and floats in water, so you can easily retrieve it should it accidentally fall into the pool.\nBut there are other options, too. I found the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 to be a great choice for using while bathing, since it provides a robust 360-degree audio and floats in water. There\u2019s also the Soundcore Select Go 4, a wonderful budget-friendly choice that can strap to your bag. Here are the six best waterproof speakers you can get today.\nThe Bose SoundLink Max is rugged. It can withstand accidental drops and has a IP67 rating for waterproofing. That waterproofing complements another feature that helps it stand out from the pack and makes it my number one pick overall: The Bluetooth speaker can float in water. It doesn\u2019t play music while it floats, but it makes it easier to retrieve it in case you knock it into the pool.\nThe audio quality is stellar on this speaker, too. Bose has a reputation for delivering robust, deep basses and crisp trebles that complement each other without overpowering either frequency. The Bose SoundLink Max delivers each frequency with ease, and it sounds lovely out of the box. If you don\u2019t feel the sound is quite right for your preferences, it comes with an easy-to-use app that lets you make adjustments up to six points in either direction for the bass, mids and trebles. Keep in mind that the speaker can only play music in one direction, although that\u2019s really only noticeable at longer distances.\nThe battery life lasts around 20 hours before you need a recharge, and the speaker doubles as a charger for your phone. If you\u2019re low on battery, connect your phone via the USB-C port on the back for a quick charge. It\u2019s not a fast charge, to be clear, but it\u2019s enough to get you through in a pinch.\nIt also comes with an interchangeable handle for carrying around, which is a must. This speaker is heavier than others I tested, weighing 4.9 pounds, which may feel too heavy for some. But for most, if you want the best balance of raw audio power, battery life and waterproofing, this is the speaker to get.\nIf you want a waterproof Bluetooth speaker but don\u2019t want to spend a fortune, the Soundcore Select 4 Go does a solid job of balancing price and power. It typically costs less than $50, but the speaker punches well above its weight for that price. It\u2019s slightly larger than my palm, and it comes with a useful strap for carrying. The thoughtful design also includes feet for setting it horizontally or vertically, which I appreciated during testing. A series of buttons located on the top of the speaker make it easy to play/pause your tunes and adjust volume.\nThe audio quality is pretty darn good, too. A speaker of this size typically struggles to hit deep basses, mainly because the built-in subwoofer can\u2019t match that of a larger one. This one does struggle with that a bit, too, but if you adjust the EQ in the Soundcore app to Bass Boost, it can, for the most part, hit those bass frequencies. It still can\u2019t quite nail deep bass notes in Ashnikko\u2019s songs, but for most, it suffices.\nLike the Bose SoundLink Max, the Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go can last up to 20 hours before requiring a charge, is IP67-rated for waterproofing and floats in water. Again, don\u2019t expect the speaker to play when it\u2019s wet\u2014the audio grows significantly quieter, and the flotation is only there to help you retrieve it. Unlike the Bose SoundLink Max, the Soundcore Select 4 Go can\u2019t charge your phone. That omission feels like a small price to pay if you want a small yet mighty Bluetooth speaker at a bargain price.\nIf you plan to use your speaker to sing in the shower, the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 is a small, no-frills speaker that fits on most shower shelves\u2014and if not, you can use the small loop on the top to hang it. The design is pretty simple, but one fun choice I\u2019m a fan of is the large plus and minus signs on the front to control the volume. They add a pop of color that just makes this little speaker look adorable.\nYou don\u2019t get app integrations or an EQ, but that\u2019s a small sacrifice. Out of the box, I was impressed with just how good the audio quality sounds. It can\u2019t rival that of the Bose, since the subwoofers and tweeters are much larger in the SoundLink Max, but basses do hit the lower notes without overpowering the other frequencies.\nI filled up my kitchen sink and tossed in the Wonderboom 4 to test the audio since the brand claims it can float. The Wonderboom 4 does float in water, but don\u2019t expect it to sound good. The flotation is only there to help you retrieve it if you accidentally drop it in water. While other speakers quieted when submerged and while they dried, I didn\u2019t notice this audio dampening too much when I sprayed it with my kitchen sink\u2019s spray faucet setting. It\u2019s only when it gets fully submerged that the sound becomes muffled.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that I tested this speaker with both my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and my iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung users may want to avoid this speaker. I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s at fault here, but there\u2019s a bug that I only experienced with my Samsung phone that causes the Bluetooth connection to sever periodically for a moment. It reconnects, but it\u2019s frequent enough that it took me out of my music, which I found frustrating. If you\u2019re team Samsung, the Soundcore Select 4 Go should be your pick; otherwise, if you\u2019re team Apple or Pixel, the Wonderboom 4 is a great choice for your next shower karaoke session.\nFor those who want the most portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker available, I found the JBL Charge 6 to be the best option. It\u2019s a Bluetooth speaker that only weighs 3 pounds and comes with a detachable carry strap for convenience. The design is the most rugged of all I tested: You can drop it on concrete, knock it off a desk (I learned this with the help of my cat) and more and it still looks brand new. Its waterproof rating is slightly higher than others I tested at IP68. In short, that means that the speaker can be submerged for longer periods of time than an IP67 rating, though the JBL Charge 6 is built to float. I didn\u2019t find it to be the prettiest design, but it sure is the sturdiest, and you can set it horizontally or vertically.\nThe JBL app is intuitive\u2014of all the waterproof Bluetooth speakers I tested, I found it to be the easiest to use, and required no learning curve. It has a few different settings, including JBL Signature, Chill, Energetic, Vocal and Custom. It uses JBL Signature out of the box, which I think is totally sufficient. Some of the presets, like Chill, I found to be lacking and muddled the audio quality too much for my taste, while others like Energetic sounded vibrant and closer to my rigorous expectations. One piece of advice? Don\u2019t use the AI Boost feature included with the software\u2014it made my music sound too tinny for my taste.\nIts battery life can last up to 24 hours, but if you forget to charge it up, the speaker offers what\u2019s called Playtime Boost. This feature ekes out another four hours when it\u2019s lower on battery to last up to 28 hours. The speaker also allows you to charge your phone if you\u2019re running low, but make sure you add your own USB-C cable. To reduce e-waste, the company doesn\u2019t ship any cables with the speaker.\nThere are a lot of Bluetooth speakers available that are larger than this one and have a louder audio profile. They typically only offer an IPX rating, which means the speaker is only splash-proof\u2014not waterproof and dustproof. They also may be a pain to haul around because of their size. The Sony ULT Field 5 is a little larger than the other Bluetooth speakers I tested, but it presents the best blend of portability, waterproofing and loudness if you want to turn up the music. It\u2019s not the prettiest speaker, thanks to its boxy shape, but LED lights add a fun flair. The review unit I received was an off-white colorway; I worried about dirt showing on the mesh exterior, but during testing, I didn\u2019t experience any issues with smudge marks. You can also use the detachable strap to carry it around like a crossbody bag, which I found useful when taking it to my local park.\nThe audio quality of the Sony ULT Field 5 is pretty good out of the box, although the bass feels a little weak, but that\u2019s easily fixed by doing two things. First, make sure you open the app, navigate to the settings and adjust your EQ settings. Sony\u2019s app isn\u2019t the most intuitive I tested, but it\u2019s still pretty easy to find these adjustments. Next, use the ULT button on the Field 5, which boosts the bass frequencies. This feature also amplifies your audio and makes it the loudest of all the Bluetooth speakers I tested. It truly makes the listening experience, and I recommend using the ULT feature whenever possible.\nThat said, like the other Sony ULT speakers I tested, using this feature comes at the expense of battery life. Still, since the battery life lasts up to 25 hours, you still get plenty of playtime. Another similar feature to others on this list, the Sony ULT Field 5 floats in water for easy retrieval.\nThe Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd Gen) is a puck-shaped waterproof Bluetooth speaker with a lovely metal mesh design that looks simply luxe. You can set it on a tabletop or use the included leather strap to hang or tie it. I\u2019m mixed on the design. On the one hand, I love the puck shape: It stays firmly in place when resting on a surface. My biggest gripe is that strap. For a design that looks and feels so premium, the leather strap feels like an afterthought. I would like to see a sturdier strap, but it\u2019s also worth noting that during my testing, the straps stayed firmly tied when I used them.\nThe audio quality on this speaker feels very premium. Bang & Olufsen did a stellar job of balancing all five EQ presets, though if you prefer, you can customize it. The Bang & Olufsen app makes it easy to adjust, and uses a small circle to see all of the EQs at once, so you can easily swap if you prefer another EQ when listening to a podcast, as an example. There\u2019s also the aptX adaptive Bluetooth codec to stream your music at higher data transfers. If you\u2019re not quite sure what that means, it\u2019s a fancy way of saying it produces higher-quality Bluetooth music when in use.\nBattery life depends on your listening volume; the higher volume, the shorter the battery life. It\u2019s a little lower than others I tested, at around 18 hours, but it\u2019s easy to keep track of with a handy LED light on the top of the metal mesh panel that shows you the battery life at a glance. And, of course, because it\u2019s Bang & Olufsen, the brand didn\u2019t mince on smart integrations. The speaker comes with Amazon Alexa built-in to issue voice commands. It\u2019s pretty good about differentiating between the other smart speakers in my home, but there were moments when I asked the Bang & Olufsen a question and it registered on another device. Still, if you\u2019re out and about and have a question for Alexa, it\u2019s a must-have addition.\nThere is one catch to this premium waterproof Bluetooth speaker: Of all the speakers on this list, this is the only top pick that doesn\u2019t float in water. If you drop it, don\u2019t expect to fetch it from the surface. There\u2019s also a newer model available with an improved battery life and bass output, but if you don\u2019t mind using a last-gen device, my pick more than suffices for audiophiles.\nOther Waterproof Bluetooth Speakers I Tested\nI tested more than a dozen waterproof Bluetooth speakers to find the best one. These speakers didn\u2019t quite make the cut, but they\u2019re still worthy of your consideration. Some also include smart features, while others had impressive EQs, but just didn\u2019t slot into any specific category.\nBrane Audio Brane X: (Forbes Vetted Score: 9 out of 10): The Brane X speaker is an incredibly powerful speaker thanks to its new subwoofer design. It offers some waterproofing, but it doesn\u2019t float in water. Additionally, it\u2019s pretty darn heavy. It\u2019s a great speaker if you want to go for raw power, but don\u2019t plan to take it too far from home.\nSony ULT Field 1: (Forbes Vetted score: 8 out of 10): The Sony ULT Field 1 is a smaller sibling to the Sony ULT Field 5. I\u2019m obsessed with the orange colorway I received, since it\u2019s easy to spot, and the strap makes it easy to carry or hang. It has a great audio quality, too. Again, you should plan to use the ULT bass boost feature.\nSonos Roam II (Forbes Vetted score: 7.5 out of 10): The Sonos Roam II has a compact build that fits into a backpack water bottle holder, and of all the waterproof Bluetooth speakers I tested, it had the best audio quality. However, I couldn\u2019t get past the app, which is clunky at best and frustrating at worst. Still, fans of the Sonos brand should enjoy this speaker.\nJBL Clip 5 (Forbes Vetted score: 8 out of 10): The JBL Clip 5 has a useful clip design to attach it to your backpack, bag or hang it in a shower, and was one of the finalists for the best for shower slot. You get the same app as other JBL products, and the EQs feel powerful for its size. That said, it can\u2019t stand on its own, so plan to invest in a third-party case.\nJBL Flip 7: (Forbes Vetted score: 8.5 out of 10): The JBL Flip 7 is a pint-sized device that comes with a detachable clip rather than a carry handle. It also has the built-in AI Sound Boost feature as well as the same EQs, but it comes down to the raw power. The JBL Charge 6 has a slightly more powerful bass, and I found the carry handle easier to use.\nTribit StormBox Micro 2: (Forbes Vetted score 8 out of 10): Another great budget option, the Tribit Stormbox Micro 2 speaker is small yet mighty, and it fits in the palm of my hand. While its bite-sized package makes it easy to move around and it floats in water, the EQ presets are weak for songs with lower bass frequencies. It includes a strap on the bottom, but it doesn\u2019t keep it in place\u2014strap it to a metal bar, and it slips to face down.\nUltimate Ears Everboom: (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): Of all the waterproof Bluetooth speakers I tested, the Everboom is the speaker I keep coming back to. It has a lovely audio profile and, thanks to its vertical design, it sits on any bookshelf or stand easily. Its 360-degree audio also fills my entire 850-square foot apartment, and the battery life lasts pretty darn long. However, it just didn\u2019t quite slot into any category. It\u2019s also worth noting that while I didn\u2019t experience this with my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Google Pixel 9 Pro I also used during testing required a reconnection whenever I turned the speaker on.\nBose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen): (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): The Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen) is like the Bose SoundLink Max, except in a significantly more compact, waterproof, dustproof package. Its audio quality is just as stellar as the Max\u2014but the Max can draw more power for lower bass frequencies. It simply houses larger equipment, including a driver and subwoofer.\nBose SoundLink Plus: (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): Like its siblings, the Bose SoundLink Plus uses the same rugged design, except this time it\u2019s in a medium-sized package. It can hit the lower frequencies that the Flex can\u2019t, but it swaps the convenient carry handle for a durable loop. It\u2019s perfectly fine, but when it comes to an easy carry design, the Max\u2019s swappable handle still outshines this loop. This speaker would be suitable for those who want more power than the Flex but don\u2019t want the price tag of the Max. It offers a balance for audio quality, bass frequencies and price.\nHow I Tested The Best Waterproof Bluetooth Speakers\nTo find the best waterproof Bluetooth speakers, I put over a dozen speakers to the test, narrowing down options to top-rated brands like Bose, Anker Soundcore and more. From there, I put my shortlist to extensive testing.\nDurability\nThe best waterproof Bluetooth speakers need to be sturdy. Because you\u2019re taking these speakers to the pool or beach, ideally, they also need an IP66 and above waterproof rating. I compared the IP rating of each contender, carefully examining its ability to withstand everything from beach days to unexpected showers. I also sprayed each waterproof Bluetooth speaker with my kitchen faucet spray nozzle to see how each reacted and performed. For the models that claimed to float in water, I filled my kitchen sink with water and tossed them in, noting any changes in the audio quality.\nDesign\nSince the main draw of a Bluetooth speaker for most is its portability, a good waterproof Bluetooth speaker should be lightweight, easy to carry and have a strap to help haul it around. To make sure each speaker on this list is easy to travel with, I started by noting and comparing the weight and size of each contender. I also took note of how easy each speaker was to carry around, and awarded extra points to options with built-in straps, handles and flotation features. I also considered strap design, noting where some straps may fall short.\nAudio Quality\nThis was where the bulk of my testing came into play. No matter what genre you\u2019re listening to, your audio quality should have a good balance of bass, mids and treble frequencies. None of these frequencies should sound muddled or distorted during listening sessions, and so I looked for crystal clear clarity and smoothness among the frequencies. I cross-checked audio quality in each Bluetooth speaker across a variety of songs, and I considered differences across multiple EQs, speaker direction and more. I also checked how far the speaker reached, placing it on the opposite end of my large living room and seeing how each speaker sounded as the audio projected.\nSome of the genres that I listen to include alternative, rock, classical, audiobooks/podcasts and more. Specifically, some of the songs I tested each pair of Bluetooth speakers include:\n- Florence + the Machine\u2019s \u201cKing,\u201d \u201cCosmic Love\u201d and \u201cDog Days Are Over\u201d\n- Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s \u201cScheherazade\u201d\n- Ashnikkos\u2019 \u201cWorms\u201d and \u201cDaisy\u201d\n- Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe\u201d and \u201cRed Wine Supernova\u201d\n- Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cThe Chain\u201d\n- Fitz and the Tantrums\u2019 \u201c123456,\u201d \u201cLivin\u2019 For The Weekend,\u201d and \u201cI Just Wanna Shine\u201d\n- Grandson\u2019s \u201cEulogy,\u201d \u201cDirty,\u201d and \u201cBury Me Face Down\u201d\n- Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cDNA,\u201d \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d \u201ctv off (feat. lefty gunplay)\u201d and, \u201cluther (with sza)\u201d\n- The entire soundtracks to seasons one and two of the Netflix show Arcane\nBattery Life\nWhen you\u2019re listening to your music, you want to be able to listen for hours without interruptions. I tested each speaker for 30 minutes each, logging battery percentages at the beginning and at the end. I also tested this across multiple frequencies and volumes to see if there were any changes as I shifted features. This way, I could get a sense of whether each speaker lived up to its claims.\nOne more thing that helped some waterproof Bluetooth speakers stand out from the crowd: Some, but not all, of the picks on my list allow for portable charging on the go. Some also offer quick charging, meaning you can get a couple more hours of playback after charging for 10 to 15 minutes.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted team has published hundreds of tech and electronic guides that leverage our hands-on testing and research, including audio stories for all of your listening needs like wireless headphones, wireless earbuds, outdoor speakers and more.\n- Consumer tech and electronics editor Rebecca Isaacs has been involved in tech journalism for over six years. In her time testing the best Bluetooth speakers, she focused on aspects of interest to everyone, from casual, occasional listening to serious audiophiles who want to enjoy every single guitar strum across a truly balanced EQ.\n- This story was reviewed by deputy editor Rose Sala, a veteran journalist with over a decade of experience who oversees the tech section at Forbes Vetted.\n- We also tapped an expert to share his unbiased insights for this story: Shaun O\u2019Brien, founder and managing director of Selby.\n- We revisit our content to make sure our recommendations are still the best of the best. We first published this article in July 2025.\nHow To Choose A Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker\nWhen choosing the best waterproof Bluetooth speaker for your needs, there are a few factors to consider, including waterproofing, audio quality and more. Here\u2019s how to make sure you pick a waterproof Bluetooth speaker that suits your needs.\nWaterproofing\nAbove all, make sure that your Bluetooth speaker has some kind of water resistance. \u201cIPX ratings deal purely with water resistance,\u201d says O\u2019Brien, adding, \u201cAn IPX4 device handles splashes like rain, IPX6 handles heavy splashes from any direction and IPX7 survives full immersion up to one meter for half an hour.\u201d If you want the best protection, opt for IP67 waterproofing, but if you opt for IPX, make sure you review what kind of IPX rating you need.\nThe best waterproof Bluetooth speakers go a step further and have the ability to float in water. This doesn\u2019t mean that you can listen to them while they float; rather, it means that if you accidentally drop them in water, they float so you can easily retrieve them.\nAudio Quality\nBecause waterproofing features can distort the sound, a good waterproof Bluetooth speaker should sound great without having too much bass. More importantly, it should \u201cnot distort when wet,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. Your waterproof Bluetooth speaker needs to be able to \u201ctune around waterproofing.\u201d\nBattery Life\nIf you plan to spend all day at the beach, you want a battery life to match. \u201cGo for at least eight hours if you want something that lasts a full day out,\u201d recommends O\u2019Brien. He goes on to add that you should consider that the number advertised may not be the full amount of life the speaker has, adding that, \u201cThe packaging will always advertise optimum usage, so knock 20 percent off whatever they claim.\u201d\nPortability\nDepending on how frequently you plan to pack this into your bag, less weight is usually best. You can get a small palm-sized speaker that \u201cfits anywhere, but bass suffers noticeably,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. A medium-sized speaker can weigh anywhere from 2.2 pounds to over 4 pounds, \u201cbut become cumbersome quickly if you are carrying them longer than 30 minutes,\u201d adds O\u2019Brien. If you plan to take it along with you, for the heavier speakers, make sure there\u2019s a sturdy carry strap or handle to help you move it around."

      "text": "Of course you want your Bluetooth speaker to sound great, but that\u2019s only part of the equation; a long battery life and ease of use\u2014whether you\u2019re controlling your music from the speaker itself or the accompanying app\u2014is equally important. To find the best Bluetooth speakers on the market, I relied on my experience as a classically trained musician and self-professed music junkie (my Spotify Wrapped tells me I listened for more than 72,000 minutes annually) by putting over 20 Bluetooth speakers to the test. After hundreds of hours of testing and comparing their sound quality, design, battery and more, my favorite overall is the Bose SoundLink Max. It gives the best balance of everything I sought in a speaker: a rugged design, stellar audio quality, a long battery life and an intuitive app.\nIn addition to Bose, I tested other Bluetooth speakers that may better suit your needs. My best budget Bluetooth speaker, the Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go, punches above its weight and costs less than $50. Another one of my favorites, the Brane Audio Brane X, delivers an incredible amount of bass. Here are the best Bluetooth speakers, found after testing over 20 speakers by listening to hundreds of hours of music and podcasts for more than two months.\nBest for:\n- Great balance across all audio frequencies\n- A rugged design with built-in flotation\nSkip if:\n- You want omnidirectional music\n- You want a lighter, more portable Bluetooth speaker\nThe Bose SoundLink Max ticked all my boxes. Bose designs typically focus on a somewhat rugged aesthetic, and that branding is definitely on display here; its boombox build is built to resist bumps and scrapes, but visually, it doesn\u2019t hold a visual candle to the Marshall Middleton, my midrange pick. Still, the rugged build is what helped cement it as a top pick, as I dropped it and it didn\u2019t show any marks.\nThe speaker offers a convenient detachable rope handle, which made it easy to move around my home. If you want, you can add a shoulder strap, though that\u2019s sold separately for an extra $45. The carry handle suffices, and you\u2019ll need it\u2014this speaker is 4.8 pounds, which is heavy for a portable speaker. Buttons on the top are easy to find and use, too.\nIts stereo sound is exemplary; basses sound deep, mids and trebles balance wonderfully. One of my favorite examples of just how this speaker delivers is with Ashnikko\u2019s \u201cDaisy,\u201d which at the very beginning hits deep, deep basses that I\u2019ve found is difficult for speakers to play properly. The Bose hits this bass note with ease, while balancing the rest of the frequencies. For context, only a handful of Bluetooth speakers I tested hit that particular note.\nBose\u2019s app is one of the best around, with easy-to-use controls and simple EQ software. You don\u2019t get any presets, but you can adjust each frequency. I missed presets, but at least Bose makes it simple to tune your music to your preferences. The stereo only faces in one direction, but even so, still had robust audio that rivaled 360-degree speakers.\nAnother feature that sets this speaker apart from the pack? Its IP67 waterproof rating, which is great for pool parties\u2014but it\u2019s the fact that it floats that really wowed me. During a briefing, one of the Bose representatives tied a rope to its strap and threw the speaker smack dab into the middle of a pool. On the other hand, don\u2019t expect it to float and play music. The speaker faces downward into the water, so you\u2019ll get no audio. That said, it won\u2019t sink to the bottom of the ocean, so that\u2019s great peace of mind for beach parties.\nBattery life gets you around 20 hours on a charge. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to keep the original Bose cord, as it won\u2019t charge with other cables, based on my testing. Even so, the speaker can charge your phone using any USB-C cable. It\u2019s pricier compared to the other options on this list, but for that $400 price tag, its extra features make it worth that splurge.\nBest for:\n- Enjoying your music without spending three figures\n- Taking on the go, as it fits in your hand\nSkip if:\n- You want much better audio quality\nThe Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go surpassed my expectations. Just larger than the palm of my hand, it has a strap hook to carry it via a carabiner. It only has a few buttons: play, pause, power, Bluetooth and volume. On the corner, you\u2019ll find a single USB-C port with a silicone cover to block moisture. It can be placed horizontally or vertically with the help of four little feet on the bottom, which is a nice, unexpected feature.\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t the best Bluetooth speaker I tested for audio quality: Even with bass boost on, the lower frequencies simply can\u2019t match that of its more expensive competitors. However, at this price point, the fact that it can hit as many of the frequencies is does is pretty darn impressive, and the quality is adequate for casual listeners. Soundcore has built a reputation for creating quality audio equipment for a fraction of the price. Once again, Anker hits the bullseye with this tiny speaker that\u2019s less than $50.\nBe sure that you play around with the EQs\u2014odds are you\u2019ll want to toss on the Bass Boost EQ over the Soundcore Signature Sound EQ. That said, it\u2019s impressive that given this price point, it even has EQ presets (other speakers in this price range that I tested don\u2019t offer any). Remember Ashnikko\u2019s, \u201cDaisy,\u201d I mentioned I tested with Bose? The Select 4 Go can\u2019t quite hit those bass notes, and they sound a couple notes higher than they should. That\u2019s a problem for me.\nThe 20-hour battery life is impressive, but during testing, it fell a hair short. It\u2019s not a big a deal, considering that it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll play it for 20 continuous hours. It\u2019s also a nice perk that it comes with IP67 waterproofing\u2014and after tossing it in my kitchen sink filled with water, I can confirm it floats.\nIt\u2019s easy to connect two speakers to make a more robust sound profile, too, thanks to the Soundcore software. During testing, they synced up nicely. Because it\u2019s less than $50, it\u2019s also great for teens and kids that want a speaker but you\u2019re concerned about them getting tossed around. Overall, its simply impressive that Anker managed to pack all of these features plus a decent audio into such a compact, affordable package.\nBest for:\n- Robust 360-degree audio quality in a compact package\n- The vintage mesh design\n- Forgetting about battery life most of the time\nSkip if:\n- You want a more robust bass or lower frequencies in your audio\n- You want a grab handle to carry this speaker around\n- You want a customizable EQ\nThe Marshall Emberton III is the best small Bluetooth speaker you can get right now. Sure, the Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go is smaller, but at that size, you\u2019re sacrificing some bass and lower frequencies. The Marshall Emberton III is a little bigger, and the boxy shape makes it easy to tuck into a bag or place it literally anywhere. On top, you\u2019ll find a few buttons, including a volume control and a toggle that you move to the left and right for forward and rewind (admittedly, it takes some getting used to). I usually prefer colors other than black, but this design is simply lovely, giving me some serious nostalgia for my father\u2019s vintage stereo speakers.\nThe EQs and audio quality sound on par with its sibling, the Marshall Middleton, and regarding lower frequencies, the Middleton edges it out\u2014the bass is simply more powerful on the Middleton. Still, it can more than deliver lower frequencies and make them sound good. It doesn\u2019t offer many EQ presets; choose between the signature Marshall, Push (which is essentially the dynamic mode) or Voice for your podcasts. I was disappointed that I can\u2019t customize EQ, but it does a good job maintaining a rounded listening profile nonetheless. The sound passes through bidirectionally for 360-degree audio, which the company calls True Stereophonic audio. It does a solid job filling my living room, including when I sit far away from it.\nThe battery lasts up to 32 hours, which I was able to get in my own testing as long as I kept the volume on a medium setting. Like others on this list, it\u2019s rated for IP67 so it can handle outdoor elements or pool parties. There\u2019s no strap, but you can add your own thanks to a slot on the corner. Don\u2019t expect any smart assistant compatibility, but the app is fairly straightforward. You can also elongate the lifespan in the app with small changes, like only charging to 95% and invoking adaptive charging.\nBest for:\n- Heart-pounding bass for all your beats\n- A \u201cset it up and forget it\u201d speaker; it sounds good out of the box\n- The outdoors\u2014this speaker\u2019s power works well in large spaces\nSkip if:\n- You are conscientious of your neighbors\n- You don\u2019t want to spend too much on a Bluetooth speaker\nI first heard about the Brane X through word of mouth, when a colleague insisted I needed to make an appointment to see this new speaker at CES 2024. Not one to miss out on innovative audio technologies, I snuck in a last-minute appointment with the Brane team\u2014and it was one of the best choices I\u2019ve made at any CES show to date. That\u2019s because the technology behind it is truly innovative. The company spent years redesigning the subwoofer blueprint, eventually landing on the magnetized Repel-Attract Driver (RAD) subwoofer blueprint its speaker, the Brane X, currently uses\u2014and it produces staggeringly great sound.\nThe Brane X\u2019s subwoofer, simply put, is one of the most powerful bass-focused Bluetooth speakers on the market. It blew almost every other speaker I tested out of the water for the raw power its subwoofers deliver. If you\u2019re worried about the bass being too powerful, you can choose from three levels of bass to customize your listening experience. Even then, it\u2019s pretty powerful, but I\u2019m a fan as there have been plenty of times these frequencies sound muddled or get lost in the mix. Also, be prepared to feel the bass shaking every surface around where this speaker gets placed, which to me only enhanced the party. If you are mindful of your neighbors, this might not be the speaker for you; you simply won\u2019t be able to draw on its raw power, and to me, as an apartment dweller, that\u2019s a disappointment.\nPress the power, and you\u2019ll hear a buzzing sound to confirm that the speaker is turning on (it also does this when it turns off). You can connect it to Amazon Alexa\u2014just make sure you take the time to set it up and log in, which can be tricky as my unit took a few tries. It\u2019s also Apple AirPlay compatible. For the audio quality, I ended up finagling the EQ for a custom setting. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014it sounds pretty good out of the box, but I usually tweak any speaker to get the sound I crave. Get two, and you can pair them together, too.\nThere are some drawbacks to the Brane X that are worth noting. It doesn\u2019t use USB-C for charging. This surprised me as every other Bluetooth speaker I tested offers this universal charging, and it makes it more difficult to charge if it runs low on battery. That leads me to my next point: Make sure that you charge your speaker the night before since I found that the battery tends to drain over time even when you\u2019re not using it. A few times, I tried to turn it on and found the battery had depleted itself. And of course, it\u2019s heavy thanks to that lovely subwoofer. The carry handle is nice, but I personally wouldn\u2019t take this speaker with me for a day at the beach.\nBest for:\n- Its rugged build: Drop it, toss it, and it still works\n- The intuitive, easy-to-digest app\nSkip if:\n- You want a prettier design\n- You want more robust EQ presets\nThe JBL Charge 6 has a blatantly rugged build. On one hand, it\u2019s drop resistant, so it\u2019s going to withstand a ton of bumps and scrapes. It\u2019s so sturdy that JBL jokingly recommends on its company website not tossing the speaker around to impress your friends, and there\u2019s a certain degree of truth to that claim. My cat decided to test this for me by knocking it off a desk, and it still looks brand new. It\u2019s rated IP68 for water- and dustproofing, and it can handle a 1 meter drop to concrete with ease.\nThe speaker\u2019s rubber feet help it stay firmly in place on most surfaces, and on the top, there\u2019s two grooves where a removable carry handle can lock into place. The strap is easy to add and remove, too. It makes it easy to carry around and set on most surfaces, and because it\u2019s more lightweight compared to other speakers I tested, that helps cement its winner in the portable Bluetooth speakers category.\nIf you\u2019re seeking an intuitive app, the JBL app was among the easiest I tested across all brands. Make sure you download the correct app\u2014there\u2019s the JBL Portable App, which is for Bluetooth speakers, and the JBL Headphones app, which is for their headphones, and they look similar in the app store. It\u2019s easy to connect and there\u2019s virtually no learning curve when you want to adjust the EQs. Choose from the JBL Signature, Chill, Energetic, Vocal or Custom (I personally recommend Energetic since it gives the music extra vibrancy), and the audio quality is pretty good out of the box. There\u2019s an AI Boost feature that I felt made the music a little tinny, so I opted not to use it. I found some of the presets to be lacking (for example, I thought Chill muddled the quality too much for my taste).\nBattery life is pretty solid; it can go up to 24 hours on a charge, with its Playtime Boost eking out another four hours in a pinch for a total of 28 hours. It takes up to three hours to charge, and you can also see battery life at a glance on the app\u2019s home page, which was nice. You can connect a second JBL Charge 6, too, but don\u2019t expect to connect with just any JBL speaker. I couldn\u2019t get that feature to work with my JBL Flip 7, for example, despite the claim you can pair multiple Bluetooth speakers for a stereo sound with its Auracast technology. One more thing to note: A 10 minute charge gets you up to 150 minutes of playtime.\nBut the final feature that makes it a worthy pick for portability? You can use the Charge 6 to charge your phone in a pinch. If you are prone to running low on battery, make sure you pack a USB-C cable for peace of mind. The speaker doesn\u2019t come with its own.\nBest for:\n- Its superb balance of aesthetics, audio quality and battery life\n- Adjusting EQs on the fly, thanks to the physical buttons on the speaker\nSkip if:\n- You want EQ presets\n- You don\u2019t want a four-pound Bluetooth speaker without a carry handle\nBose may have landed at the top of the list, but that\u2019s because in addition to making good quality audio, it knows how to make a rugged speaker. Marshall, on the other hand, knows how to up the ante with aesthetics. Like the Emberton III, the Marshall Middleton has a metallic mesh design. The lighter cream hue I received also gives off the vintage vibes with which I\u2019m obsessed. For the aesthetic alone, this was my favorite speaker. You also get a strap to help carry the speaker, but it\u2019s placed on the corner, and feels counterintuitive. I don\u2019t want to swing my four-pound Bluetooth speaker around, and it would have been nice to have a detachable carry handle. Ultimately, I kept it stationary.\nThe app\u2019s EQ presets leave a little to be desired for those that may not be as familiar with EQs. You can adjust bass and treble frequencies, but that\u2019s it\u2014you don\u2019t get any EQ presets, which I found disappointing. That\u2019s not to say that the audio needs adjustments\u2014this speaker sounds so rich that during my testing, I didn\u2019t feel the need to adjust either EQ frequency. You can shift between tracks in the app, which was nice if I didn\u2019t feel like opening up Spotify. It\u2019s also cool that Marshall added EQ adjustments right on the top of the speaker to make adjustments on the fly.\nIt was one of only four speakers in which I could distinctly hear the baritone saxophone blending alongside other instruments during Fitz and the Tantrums\u2019 \u201cI Just Wanna Shine,\u201d and, more importantly, I could hear the musical notes well. That\u2019s a huge distinction as some speakers I tested made that particular instrument sound like a squawking parrot. The same went for tracks like, \u201cMa Meilleure Ennemie,\u201d by Strommae and Pomme, where some speakers muddled the layers; the Middleton balanced them beautifully. Out of all the Bluetooth speakers I tested, this one was my favorite if I was testing solely based on audio quality. It sounds significantly more expensive than it costs.\nThe speaker\u2019s battery life isn\u2019t as robust as I would have liked, as it only gets around 20 hours of playtime. 20 minutes of charging can get you another two hours, which is lower than the JBL Charge 6, but it\u2019s still solid if you\u2019re in a pinch. Like the Bose SoundLink Max and the JBL Charge 6, you can also charge your phone from this speaker, too. It\u2019s also important to note that unlike the Bose SoundLink Max, this speaker doesn\u2019t float in water, but it\u2019s protected against water and dust with an IP67 rating.\nBest for:\n- Luxurious audio quality\n- Controlling your audio\u2019s direction\n- Qi charging on the go\nSkip if:\n- You\u2019re prone to forgetting to turning off your speaker\n- You don\u2019t need the slew of extras this speaker offers\n- You don\u2019t want to spend an eye-watering four figures\nIf you value a premium audio quality above all else, the Bang & Olufsen Beosound A5 is the one you should buy. The Bluetooth speaker costs an eye-watering $1,550, but for that premium price, it has a lot going for it. The unit I tested featured gorgeous wood paneling that fit nicely on my vintage 1900s leather top desk\u2014not to mention in my modern kitchen. If you\u2019re not keen on a wood finish, there is also a rattan, called Nordic Weave, and a silver modern look, too. The charge port is on the back but controls are conveniently placed on top\u2014just make sure that you turn it off. The speaker only turns off after 90 minutes of inactivity, and there were a few times I forgot to turn it off and later found the speaker dead. You can disable this in the app.\nStill, its audio quality is hands-down the most luxe I tested. The A5 comes with a list of EQ presets: Lounge, Party, Speech and more. If you really want to, you can make a custom EQ as well. It works well enough, but it\u2019s not needed for this speaker\u2014it sounds lovely unboxed. In addition, the Beosound A5 can play 360-audio or direct the sound toward the front, depending on your EQ preset. Some EQs, like Party, are only available with 360-degree audio, which surprised me.\nThe Beosound A5 still outperformed the competition. It can hit the lower frequencies with ease, and it balanced nicely with the mids and trebles. It sounds good, and some of the funk to Remi Wolf\u2019s tracks truly shined across the EQs. This was built to handle all your genres with ease, and, \u201cThe New Yorker Radio Hour,\u201d episodes showcased well on the Speech setting, though I could have easily left it on Party or Lounge, my two preferred EQs.\nIt\u2019s also the only speaker I tested that offers a swappable battery. If your battery starts failing, Bang & Olufsen will help you replace it. For those with a focus on sustainability, this is a real boon. Its battery life clocks in at around 12 hours on a medium setting; during testing, I found that was mostly true, but noted that when I turned it up to higher volumes, the battery life does drop. Prior to testing and during my research, while I didn\u2019t quite hit these low numbers, some customers commented that they got around five hours of battery life. I clocked in around 6-7, depending on how high I turned up the volume (and risked angering my neighbors), so mileage varies here. Another cool feature: It offers Qi charging on the top, which is unique in all the speakers I tested.\nThat said, while it\u2019s portable, don\u2019t expect to take this one on your next beach trip: It\u2019s the heaviest speaker I tested. The handle is nice and the speaker holds up well to accidental bumps and scrapes, but I can\u2019t imagine taking this outside of my home or backyard patio.\nOther Bluetooth Speakers I Tested\nI tested more than 20 Bluetooth speakers to find the best one. These are some that didn\u2019t make the top cut, but were good enough to receive honorable mentions. Some include smart features, while others had impressive EQs.\n- Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd Gen) ($187): I love the design of this speaker. Its small, rounded profile is easy to slip into a bag, and the metal mesh paneling looks gorgeous in any setting. That said, it\u2019s $300\u2014around $130 more than my current small-sized pick, the Marshall Emberton III. Also, I don\u2019t fully trust its leather cord to carry or hold the speaker; it feels like an afterthought.\n- Sony ULT Field 1 ($100): This speaker has a great audio quality, and I\u2019m obsessed with the orange shade I received. However, I couldn\u2019t find a specific category to slot this speaker into. It\u2019s great value for the price, but the app may take some time getting used to. It\u2019s not as intuitive as others on this list.\n- Sonos Roam II ($175): The Sonos Roam II impressed me for multiple reasons: It has a compact build that easily slides into a backpack water bottle holder and its audio quality was arguably the best I tested in this size range. That said, the app is very, very counterintuitive, and I grew frustrated with it.\n- JBL Clip 5 ($60): As one of the contenders for the best budget Bluetooth speaker, the JBL Clip 5 wowed me. For its size, it brings an impressive audio quality. However, I would have liked to have seen deeper basses. It also can\u2019t stand on its own\u2014you need to invest in a third-party case .\n- JBL Flip 7 ($150): The JBL Flip 7 is another rugged \u201cpint-sized\u201d design that I had mixed feelings about. Like the JBL Charge 6, it has the built-in AI Sound Boost feature. It also has the same EQs. Still, the Charge 6 ever-so-slightly edges the Flip 7 out\u2014it packs slightly more power and has the more convenient carry handle unlike the Flip 7.\n- Sony ULT Field 3 ($200): The Sony Ult Field 3 has a ton going for it: The ULT bass boost button really makes it hit those deep basses with ease. I loved the removable strap as it makes it easy to carry around. That said, the speaker sounds tinny if you don\u2019t turn on the ULT button which triggers a deeper bass, but that\u2019s at the cost of battery life.\n- Tribit StormBox Micro 2 ($55): The Tribit Stormbox Micro 2 speaker fits in the palm of my hand. While it\u2019s bite-sized package makes it easy to carry, the EQ presets are weak for songs with lower bass frequencies. Another issue that cropped up? The strap on the bottom doesn\u2019t keep it in place\u2014strap it to a metal bar, and it slips.\n- Ultimate Ears Everboom ($250): The Everboom\u2019s aesthetic fits well into any space, and the buttons are intuitive to use\u2014though putting the volume controls front and center was a bit of an odd choice. My only significant gripe, though, was that every time I used the speaker I needed to reconnect it in my Bluetooth speaker\u2019s settings.\n- Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen) ($120): Like the top pick the Bose SoundLink Max, the Flex packs a powerful audio, just in a more compact, waterproof and dustproof package. It\u2019s a darn good speaker\u2014but the Max can draw more power for lower bass frequencies because it houses larger equipment, including a driver and subwoofer.\n- Treblab HD-Go ($35): The Treblab HD-Go is a tiny speaker that rivals the size of my budget pick, the Anker Soundcore Select 4. It\u2019s great for portability, but it fell short in a couple areas of testing, namely the audio quality. The small speaker simply can\u2019t hit the lower frequencies, and without EQ settings, it sounds flat.\n- Treblab HD-360 Pro ($160): Another unit from Treblab, the HD-360 Pro gives off incredible 360-degree audio for the price, rivaling speakers that cost double as much. It\u2019s a quality budget-friendly speaker that punches above its weight impressively, but it\u2019s hard to carry around. I also didn\u2019t like that I couldn\u2019t manually adjust EQs to my liking.\nHow I Tested The Best Bluetooth Speakers\nTo find the best Bluetooth speakers, I put over 20 speakers to the test, narrowing down options to top-rated brands like Bose, Marshall and more. From there, I put my shortlist to the test.\nDurability\nThe best Bluetooth speakers should be sturdy, with at least some level of water- and dust-resistance, especially if you plan to take them to the pool. For that reason, I compared the IP rating of each contender, carefully examining its ability to withstand everything from beach days to unexpected showers.\nDesign\nSince the main draw of a bluetooth speaker for most is its portability, a good bluetooth speaker should either be lightweight and easy to carry or have a strap to help haul it around. To make sure each speaker on this list is easy to travel with, I started by noting and comparing the weight and size of each contender. I also took note of how easy each speaker was to carry around, and awarded extra points to options with built-in straps and handles.\nAudio Quality\nThis was where the bulk of my testing came into play. No matter what genre you\u2019re listening to, your audio quality should have a good balance of base, mids and treble frequencies. None of these frequencies should sound muddled or distorted during listening sessions, and so I looked for crystal clear clarity and smoothness amongst the frequencies. I cross-checked audio quality in Bluetooth speaker across a variety of songs, and I considered differences across multiple EQs, speaker direction and more. I also checked how far the speaker went, placing it on the opposite end of my large living room and seeing how each speaker sounded as the audio projected.\nSome of the genres that I listen to include alternative, rock, classical, audiobooks/podcasts and more. Specifically, some of the songs I tested each pair of Bluetooth speakers include:\n- Florence and the Machine\u2019s \u201cKing,\u201d \u201cCosmic Love\u201d and \u201cDog Days Are Over\u201d\n- Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s \u201cScheherezade\u201d\n- Ashnikkos\u2019 \u201cWorms\u201d and \u201cDaisy\u201d\n- Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe\u201d and \u201cRed Wine Supernova\u201d\n- Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cThe Chain\u201d\n- Fitz and the Tantrums\u2019 \u201c123456,\u201d \u201cLivin\u2019 For The Weekend,\u201d and \u201cI Just Wanna Shine\u201d\n- Grandson\u2019s \u201cEulogy,\u201d \u201cDirty,\u201d and \u201cBury Me Face Down\u201d\n- Kendrick Lamar\u2019s, \u201cDNA,\u201d \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d \u201ctv off (feat. lefty gunplay)\u201d and, \u201cluther (with sza)\u201d\n- The entire soundtracks to seasons one and two of the Netflix show Arcane\nBattery Life\nWhen you\u2019re listening to your music, you want to be able to listen for hours without interruptions. I tested each speaker for 30 minutes each, logging battery percentages at the beginning and at the end. I also cross tested this across multiple frequencies and volumes to see if there were any changes as I shifted features. This way, I could get a sense of whether each pair lived up to its claims.\nOne more thing that stands out from the crowd: Most of the picks on my list allow for portable charging on the go. They also have quick charging where a certain number of minutes, say 10 to 15, get you a couple hours playback.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted team has published hundreds of tech and electronic guides that leverage our hands-on testing and research, including audio stories for all of your listening needs like wireless headphones, wireless earbuds, outdoor speakers and more.\n- Consumer tech and electronics editor Rebecca Isaacs has been involved in tech journalism for over six years. In her time testing the best Bluetooth speakers, she focused on aspects of interest to everyone, from casual, occasional listening to serious audiophiles who want to enjoy every single guitar strum across a truly balanced EQ.\n- This story was reviewed by executive editor Dave Johnson, a veteran tech journalist who has authored nearly three dozen books on technology and photography. He\u2019s well-versed in the latest audio technology, regularly attends trade shows to learn about the latest audio trends, and served as the host of the popular podcast Battlestar Recaptica.\n- Three additional experts were tapped to share their unbiased insights for this story: Nathan Green, New Level Radio CEO and Cofounder; Melissa Hoistion, audio expert and VP of Marketing and E-commerce at Altec Lansing; and Alexandre Fossier, iGaming Expert and Digital Specialist at iGamingNuts.\n- We revisit this story to make sure our recommendations are still the best of the best. We last updated this article in June 2025 to expand on how we test Bluetooth speakers and add more guidance on the top factors to consider when searching for the best Bluetooth speaker for you.\nHow To Choose A Bluetooth Speaker\nTo choose the best Bluetooth speaker for your needs, you\u2019ll want to focus on five key areas: portability, durability, sound quality, battery life and price.\nPortability\nThink about, \u201chow and where you will be using the speaker,\u201d says Green, and take a look at its size, weight and portability features. A smaller, lighter speaker is easy to take with you on the go, while a larger, heavier option is best for home use. If you\u2019re planning to travel with your speaker, Hoistion says that you should consider how the speaker gets moved around. \u201cA speaker with a built-in carabiner clip might seem like a small detail, but it makes a huge difference in how often you\u2019ll actually bring it along,\u201d she says, since you can clip it to a backpack or a bicycle basket.\nDurability\nIf you are planning to take your speaker with you on the go, it\u2019s important to consider it\u2019s durability; Hoistion mentions checking, \u201cwaterproof rating and overall everything-proof capabilities.\u201d Specifically, it\u2019s a good idea to take a close look at the speaker\u2019s IP rating, which scores its ability to protect itself against dust and water.\nWhen looking at the IP rating of a speaker, the first number indicates how much it can withstand solid particles, such as dust and debris. The second number refers to its level of protection against liquids, whether that be indirect splashes or full immersion. Generally, the higher numbers mean more protection against the elements. \u201cEspecially during those summer months when you\u2019re hanging by the pool or taking a boat trip, having a speaker that\u2019s fully waterproof and can float if it falls in is a game changer,\u201d Hoistion says.\nAudio Quality\nFor audio quality, you want a robust audio across all frequencies and volumes. Fossier went further into detail, saying, \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many speakers only perform well at low volume, but start to distort the second you turn it up. I always look for solid bass, clear mids and no harsh treble, especially if you\u2019re planning to use it for more than just background noise.\u201d\nBe sure to take a look at where your audio\u2019s direction will be projecting, too. If you want 360-degree audio versus a front-facing Bluetooth speaker, you\u2019ll hear the difference. You can easily tell by looking at a speaker\u2019s design, according to Hoistion, who says, \u201cLooking at driver size and placement details can tell you a lot about how well the speaker will project sound and handle bass, mids and highs.\u201d\nYou also want to make sure that there\u2019s an EQ feature for customizing your audio, After all, Fossier says, \u201cEveryone hears sound differently, and being able to tweak it to suit your preferences makes a big difference,\u201d in your listening experience. Adjusting an EQ can mean the difference between enjoying your music or experiencing a flatness on your patio, as an example.\nBattery Life\nAdditionally, you want a long battery life for hours of playback. \u201cIf you\u2019re moving between setups like I do, you want a speaker that can go the distance without needing a charge every few hours,\u201d Fossier says. Ideally, your Bluetooth speaker should get at least 6-10 hours of playback, though most of the speakers on this list can last for over 20 hours.\nIt\u2019s not just about the playback, though; charging should also be a consideration here. Your charge shouldn\u2019t take more than a couple hours, and in a pinch, a short amount of charging time should give you enough listening time for a couple hours minimum. \u201cTry purchasing Bluetooth speakers with USB-C fast charging and enough battery life to fit individual lifestyle and listening preferences.\u201d Also, some of the Bluetooth speakers we included not only can play music for hours, but they also can charge your phone in a pinch.\nPrice\nBluetooth speakers range in price from as low as $50 to nearly $2,000; however, most options fall somewhere around $100 to $400. As with most items, the more you spend, the more premium features and higher-quality sound you can expect, although you don\u2019t need to overspend to get a quality Bluetooth speaker. Our testing showed the sweetspot (in terms of quality for the price) is typically around the $200 to $400 mark."

      "text": "Built specifically for outdoor spaces and all sorts of weather conditions, the best outdoor speakers not only make your music pop in your backyard or on the patio\u2014they\u2019re also designed to withstand the elements. After hours of research and testing, we named the Polk Audio Atrium 6 as the best outdoor speaker for its impressive audio and certifications for literally any kind of weather that gets thrown at it.\nWhile the Polk Audio Atrium 6 includes mounting hardware, you don\u2019t need to affix these speakers\u2014or others\u2014to a wall or post in order to enjoy audio outdoors. If you want the best wireless outdoor speaker, we recommend the Sonos Outdoor by Sonance. And if you want to be mindful of your budget, the Yamaha Audio NS-AW150W 2-Way Indoor/Outdoor Speakers should be your go-to. Read on to find the best outdoor speakers you can add to your backyard oasis, which we determined after hours of research and testing.\nDimensions: 8.8 x 7.8 x 11.8 inches | Driver size: 5 inches, 1-inch dome tweeter | Mounting required: Yes (includes hardware) | Waterproof rating: All-weather certified\nPros:\nImpressive audio with rich bass that suits for most\nAll-weather certified for worry-free year-round listening\nIncludes mounting brackets for easy one-click installation\nCons:\nReports that bass is too powerful for audiophiles\nWired installation may be off-putting for some\nThe Polk Audio Atrium 6 outdoor speakers offer 5.2-inch polypropylene woofers and a one-inch tweeter so you can enjoy deep bass at your next backyard party. For those who prefer a flatter profile, this may be a little off-putting, but for most people, this pair will more than suffice. Moreover, the driver\u2019s cone shape and rubber surround pumps help reduce distortion for clear audio, too. The mounting hardware is easy to use, with a one-click locking mechanism that makes for a hassle-free installation, and you can install them vertically or horizontally. Polk also says that the installation is so simple that it can be installed one-handed.\nFor those that want to install the speakers somewhere they\u2019re completely exposed to the elements, Polk\u2019s all-weather seal helps maintain their overall health over many seasons. They also come in two colors, white and black. That said, users have reported the bass sounds too powerful and drowns out the mids and trebles. It\u2019s also only available as a wired installation, not in a wireless version.\nDimensions: 5.2 x 10 x 6 inches | Driver size: 5 inches, 0.5-inch dome tweeter | Mounting required: Yes (includes hardware) | Waterproof rating: All-weather certified\nPros:\nVery affordable\nGood audio quality\nCons:\nMounting adjustments limited\nReports that all-weather certification doesn\u2019t last in harsher climates\nIf you want outdoor speakers at a truly affordable price, the Yamana NS-AW150W is available for $200 as a pair, and you can usually find them on sale for even less. For that price, the five-inch drivers have pretty good audio, and the half-inch dome tweeters round out the sound profile nicely. It won\u2019t get the deep bass found in other models on this list, but if you aren\u2019t looking for that anyway, it won\u2019t matter to you. They also come in two colors to help them blend into your space.\nBe careful how you place these. Once they\u2019re installed horizontally or vertically, you can only adjust in two directions. There are also reports from East Coast customers that the weatherproofing may not last as long in locations with extreme temperature swings. If you opt to use them in harsher climates, you may want to place them underneath a canopy to extend their lifespan.\nFloats in water if you accidentally drop it into the pool\nCons:\nCan\u2019t mount them\nThe Bose SoundLink Max ticks almost every box you\u2019d want in a portable outdoor speaker. Bose traditionally doesn\u2019t share its driver and tweeter size, but after testing, I found that the audio quality was in backyards and patios. Because it\u2019s wireless, it has a 20-hour battery life, and a convenient grab handle allows you to move it where you want it. Plus, if you accidentally drop it in the water, the speaker floats so you can grab it and get back to enjoying music\u2014it\u2019s fully waterproof. Just don\u2019t expect it to float and play music at the same time\u2014it can\u2019t do that. You can also pair a second for Stereo Mode and Party Mode to boost your tunes.\nFor a portable outdoor speaker, there are some drawbacks, though. Notably, while it can handle deep bass, it simply won\u2019t have the raw power of the other picks on our list\u2014it\u2019s too small. Yes, it does have great sound, but if you have a large yard, you\u2019ll want something that as the extra power.\nBest Wireless Outdoor Speaker\nPair It With Your Other Sonos Speakers\nSonos Architectural Speakers By Sonance\nDimensions: 7.5 x 15.4 x 7.8 inches | Driver size: 5 inches, 0.5-inch dome tweeter | Mounting required: Yes (includes hardware) | Waterproof rating: IP66\nPros:\nIntegrates with other Sonos products\nIP66 waterproof rating\nSome of the best audio quality available\nCons:\nProfessional installation recommended\nAnnoying software\nExpensive\nFor fans of the brand, Sonos Architectural Speakers by Sonance should be your pick. You get a crisp listening experience, but because it\u2019s Sonos remember that you\u2019ll need to add a Sonos Amp, which is sold separately for an extra $699. You can bundle the whole set for just over $1,400, which is pricey compared to other picks on our list. But once you add the amp, you get a clean, crisp sound that produces lovely mid and low frequencies.\nThat\u2019s partially attributable to the high-excursion pivoting subwoofer. To balance the sound, the speakers feature a one-inch tweeter to produce high frequencies, too. Another perk is that they\u2019re rated IP66, which means it can handle water sprays as powerful as a power wash. That absolutely does not mean you should spray it, but it has robust waterproofing against rain storms and other inclement weather. Also, it\u2019s important to note that these speakers use the Sonos software, which in its current form is pretty counterintuitive and has gotten catastrophic reviews by customers\u2014so new users beware. We also recommend considering a professional installation for peace of mind, too, which can also drive up the cost.\nBest Outdoor Speaker For Landscaping\nTuck All Your Cables Underground\nOSD Audio RS850 Outdoor Rock Speaker\nDimensions: 17.5 x 13 x 16 inches | Driver size: 1-inch dome tweeter, 8-inch woofer | Waterproof rating: All-weather sealed\nPros:\nResembles a rock to blend in with your backyard\nOutputs 200 watts of audio power\nAvailable in a variety of sizes and colors\nCons:\nMust bury waterproof cabling, which may be problematic for some\nNeeds an amplifier to get the most out of the audio\nIf you don\u2019t want a pair of black or white speakers, you can opt for something with natural camouflages. The OSD Audio RS850 Outdoor Rock Speaker comes in multiple rock shades to blend seamlessly into your garden, and it\u2019s sturdy enough to withstand the harshest of weather conditions thanks to the aerospace-grade build. Under that sturdy exterior, a powerful 200-watt speaker can fill large backyards with booming audio so long as you place them no more than 30 feet apart.\nIts power does mean it needs cables in order to work\u2014and those cables need to be buried, per OSD Audio\u2019s recommendations. If you\u2019re worried about disturbing your flowerbeds, look elsewhere. Like the Sonos on this list, also plan to get an amplifier that can output 100W of power at least, too.\nConsumer tech and electronics editor Rebecca Isaacs, the author of this story, regularly reviews dozens of tech products, including the best wireless headphones and the best wireless earbuds. Her expertise is in home entertainment, audio, wearables and mobile devices.\nWhen she\u2019s not researching the latest audio trends, she attends trade shows and shares her favorite tech essentials like the best Roku devices, writing tablets and more.\nWe constantly research, evaluate and update our picks to make sure they\u2019re current and accurate. Isaacs last updated this article in April 2025 to include the Yamaha Audio NS-AW150W 2-Way Indoor/Outdoor Speakers as the top budget pick.\nHow We Chose The Best Outdoor Speakers\nTo find the best outdoor speakers, we combined research with hands-on testing to seek out reputable brands and compare key features.\nWe tracked down best-selling models from well-known brands that we love and trust. We also considered brands we\u2019ve tested, including Bose and Sonos.\nWe analyzed the features of each outdoor speaker, including dimensions, driver size, mounting requirements and waterproof rating.\nWe also considered sound quality and took into consideration real customer reports and only included picks with 4+ star ratings.\nBecause everyone enjoys music differently, we made sure to include a variety of outdoor speakers to fit varying needs and budgets.\nWe also spoke with real product experts to gain more insight to outdoor speakers. In particular, we spoke with Melissa Hoistion, vice president of marketing and e-commerce at Sakar International, and Danilo Coviello, founder of Espresso Translations.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nBased on our research and testing, we named the Polk Audio Atrium 6 as the best speaker overall. It has robust waterproofing features and gives you great sound for your music and movies.\nAccording to Melissa Hoistion, vice president of marketing and e-commerce at Sakar International, one of the largest differences between and indoor and outdoor speaker is its proofing against the elements, i.e. waterproofing and dustproofing. \u201cWhere indoor speakers are typically safe from water, extreme temperatures and debris, outdoor speakers are made to ensure the safety of their internal components, no matter what scenario they face,\u201d she says. Simply put, according to Danilo Coviella, founder of Espresso Translations: \u201cIndoor speakers just are not built for the outdoors.\u201d He goes on to recommend an IP65 or higher-rated speaker for an outdoor space.\nIt\u2019s not just about its durability, too. The audio quality changes because, \u201cindoor speakers rely on walls for acoustics, while outdoor models are designed to project audio across open spaces and overcome background noise,\u201d according to Hoistion. But you also want the, \u201cability to clearly and consistently at high volumes,\" according to Coviello.\nIt will depend on your setup. \u201cIf you value convenience, wireless speakers with Bluetooth connectivity are typically the way to go. They\u2019re easy to set up and move around, and a great way to ensure users can still play their music even when an outlet isn\u2019t available, recommends Hoistion.\nBut wired also has its perks, mainly consistency. If you\u2019re seeking more consistent audio and don\u2019t want to worry about charging a device, Hoistion recommends opting for a wired speaker. \u201cWired speakers tend to deliver more consistent sound quality and allow listeners to play their music without any worry of having to charge their device,\u201d she says."

      "text": "As the tech editor here at Forbes Vetted, I test a lot of wireless earbuds. To earn my recommendation, they need to have great sound, stellar noise cancellation, a long battery life and intuitive controls. After testing two dozen pairs over the span of several months, I found that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all best wireless earbuds for everyone. My top pick is the Technics EAZ-AH100S Wireless Earbuds, which combine incredible audio quality, decent noise cancellation and battery life\u2014by far the best blend of all the pairs I tested. But, they\u2019re not going to be everyone\u2019s favorite.\nIf you value excellent active noise cancellation (ANC) above all else, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds should be your go-to choice instead. And if you\u2019re not keen on spending hundreds of dollars, there are plenty of other worthy options. My top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, can get you great sound for less than $80. Others, like the premium Denon PerL Pros, use AI to enhance audio based on your ear shape. Based on rigorous testing with 24 sets over several months, here are my picks for the best wireless earbuds.\nBest for:\n- Those who want a solid balance of audio quality and battery life\n- Sounding great out of the box without finagling with audio settings\n- Folks who think wireless charging is a must-have\nSkip if:\n- You value active noise cancellation\n- You balk at spending three figures on a pair of wireless earbuds\nThe Technics EAZ-AH100S Wireless Earbuds is the top winner: They offer a great blend of battery life, audio quality and ANC, and the design feels very sturdy as well. The earbuds are built with a blend of sturdy plastic and aluminum. Underneath that durable build, each earbud sports a 10mm magnetic fluid driver. That helps makes these earbuds sounds great when I tested them across a slew of genres.\nThese earbuds sound wonderful right out of the box\u2014you don\u2019t need to adjust anything, great if you don\u2019t want to worry about EQ settings. I enjoyed the Dynamic mode because I needed the deep bass on the Arcane series soundtracks, which has become my go-to for testing for those low frequencies and sharp guitar riffs across the curated tracks. It hit all of these without this setting, but Bass Boost and Super Bass Boost (two separate options), are also available for those who thrive on extra power.\nBattery life is also stellar. With ANC on, the earbuds last up to 10 hours. Comparatively, my former top pick for ANC, the Bose QuietComfort Ultras, only last up to six hours on a charge. It\u2019s long enough that I can go days without charging them, especially on days when I\u2019m only using these for my subway commutes. And unlike the Bose QuietComfort Ultras, they feature wireless charging, which came in handy on the rare occasions when I needed to charge them.\nThat said, my biggest gripe is the ANC: Even after testing in loud spaces and making adjustments, it\u2019s good, but could be better. It effectively tunes out the schoolchildren that play right outside my home, but fell short of eliminating the screechy NYC MTA subway system. And I could still hear ambient noise on planes as well. That said, they offer an ambient mode as well\u2014an adjustable noise blocking feature that can reduce, say, light coffee shop chatter while allowing you to hear traffic as examples.\nThe 2025 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.\nBest for:\n- Those who prioritize noise cancellation\n- Its intuitive app, which offers flexibility without diving too much into the details\nSkip if:\n- You value battery life\n- You balk at high price tags\n- You don\u2019t want to pay extra for wireless charging\nThe noise canceling found in the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is unparalleled. During my testing, there were multiple times that I didn\u2019t hear my husband approach until he tapped my shoulder. Subway rides also were also muted and I could enjoy reading my Kindle Paperwhite in near silence, quite a feat considering how deafening New York City public transit can be.\nWhile the equalizer adjustment controls are minimal (you can change the earbuds\u2019 frequencies for bass, mids and trebles up to six levels in either direction), they get the job done, and it\u2019s not fully necessary to adjust them at all. I found myself only tweaking them a bit to enhance the bass, since the audio quality is so good out of the box. And if you find yourself swapping between your laptop and phone regularly, they support multipoint connectivity.\nAll said, there are a couple drawbacks that left me less than enthused. For one, the battery life is relatively short; I wore them on a transcontinental flight and used them in the airport, thinking I would get a full six hours with ANC on, but I heard the dreaded low battery notification mid-flight. It\u2019s not the end of the world\u2014a quick 15-minute charge gets you another two hours in a pinch\u2014but it\u2019s a big enough drawback that if you want long-lasting earbuds, look elsewhere. Secondly, the case is a bulky beast that does not offer wireless charging, and you need to pay an additional $49 for a wireless charging case. I personally find this insulting, considering the already-costly $299 sticker price.\nThe Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Ultras would have been my top choice based solely on sound quality, because yes, it\u2019s that good, even edging out the Technics. In fact, they were my top pick until I cross-tested Technics, and after extensive evaluation, the battery life and lack of wireless charging keeps them from nabbing top billing. Finally to clarify, the brand has wireless headphones with the same name that also happen to be the best wireless headphones you can get, so keep this in mind when shopping to avoid confusion. You can read more about these earbuds in my review.\nBest for:\n- Enjoying music on the go without spending a fortune\n- Wearing earbuds for hours in comfort\nSkip if:\n- You want a dedicated app to control the earbuds\n- You are not a fan of touch controls\nThe OnePlus Buds 3 feel like a dark horse winner as my best budget pick, but after extensive testing, they\u2019re truly the best if you\u2019re being mindful of your spending. The earbuds come with touch controls, which is mostly fine, though during testing I learned the hard way not to apply a lot of pressure. If you do, the earbuds shift in your ear canal. They won\u2019t fall out\u2013they were quite secure in my ear\u2013but it can be annoying. A simple tap or gentle long press is all you need to control them.\nIf you\u2019re not an iPhone or OnePlus phone user, then the app may also give you pause. The Hey Melody app for Android users doesn\u2019t get as deep into the frequency weeds as other earbud apps, like the Denon PerL Pros. Still, it does a solid job of delivering the basics, including four listening profiles and the ability to create a custom profile via five different frequency settings.\nLooking past the app, though, the price/value ratio wowed me. The audio felt detailed and rich, especially once I turned on OnePlus 3D Audio (the brand\u2019s version of spatial audio). I also completed a sound test profile to help finesse my listening experience, which enhanced some areas that I felt were lacking. They simply have no right to sound as good as they do, with some of the details in the mids layering nicely compared with other competitors in this price range.\nCould the audio be better? Absolutely\u2014the bass in particular could be stronger. But at that point, you\u2019re looking at spending three figures on the Bose or the Denons to get that high-quality deep bass. These earbuds cost around $70, and for the price, you get pretty darn good audio.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro wireless earbuds don\u2019t offer the single best audio quality, and the ANC isn\u2019t the absolute best on the market. But when I\u2019m heading into the subway, or when I\u2019m about to hop on a plane, they\u2019re the pair I always take with me. I\u2019ve had them since last July\u2019s Samsung Unpacked, and after testing them for several months with my Android device, they\u2019ve become my top pick for the category because they represent the best combination of ANC, audio quality and more for Android users.\nYes, they mimic the Apple AirPods\u2019 design\u2014that\u2019s something the company caught flack for at the initial launch. But that design wears comfortably in my ears and I can keep them in for long hours without my ears feeling itchy, a problem I experience with most wireless earbuds.\nHead to the app when you want to adjust your ANC levels. There you\u2019ll also find a few audio presets, including balanced, dynamic and bass boost. Personally, I found dynamic to be the most effective, but your mileage and preferences may vary. Other useful features include 360 audio which aims to place you in the middle of the action, and you can also turn on head-tracking if that suits you. Songs like Florence and the Machine\u2019s \u201cKing\u201d and \u201cCosmic Love\u201d sounded rich and detailed. I typically test audio for the balance of the harp in the latter against the rest of the instrumentals. While further into the song, the harp was hard to distinguish, it\u2019s still good enough for most needs.\nWith many earbuds offering touch controls, the physical buttons feel like a boon in a sea of accidental touches, something that I\u2019ve had happen more times thanks to my bushy hair. I\u2019ve also felt the advertised battery life\u2014around 7 hours\u2014is good. Because they pair best with Samsung phones and I use the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, I can open the settings and see the battery life at a glance from the Bluetooth display.\nBut that leads to another caveat: Android versus iOS. If you have an Android phone\u2014particularly a Samsung device\u2014these earbuds integrate just fine. If you have iOS, though, you may have a problem, as Apple users don\u2019t have access some of the Wear app integrations. And to an extent, this affects Google Pixel users, too. But if you have a Samsung phone, these are absolutely the earbuds to get. And they\u2019re still pretty rad for most other Android phones, too.\nBest for:\n- Staying smack dab in middle of the Apple ecosystem\n- Talking to others without pausing audio (via Conversation Awareness)\n- Spatial audio when watching content on your iPhone\nSkip if:\n- You don\u2019t want to spend too much on your earbuds\n- You want more EQ customization control\nThe Apple AirPods Pro 2 are the best wireless earbuds for Apple users: They feature Apple\u2019s sleek design with silicone ear tips to help them stay firmly in your ears. One of my biggest concerns with any stem design was that they may fall out, but no matter how hard I jumped around, I simply couldn\u2019t get these to budge. The stem design also makes it easy to use the touch controls.\nThe audio quality rivals that of another pair of AirPods I tested, the Apple AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation. Whereas I spotted some detrimental differences in the mids and basses on the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, the Apple AirPods Pro 2 nailed these frequencies and balances on two songs, Florence and The Machine\u2019s \u201cCosmic Love\u201d and \u201cKing.\u201d\nApple\u2019s ANC includes a mode called Conversation Awareness that automatically allows you to hear what\u2019s going on around you when it recognizes that you\u2019re talking to someone. It was great when I worked at home and wanted to tune out the schoolchildren in my neighborhood\u2014but there were moments when I was listening to music and it mistakenly thought my husband speaking to me and subdued the audio; in reality, he was conversing with his parents in the same room I was trying to zone out in.\nOne of the coolest features by far is the built-in Hearing Loss Detection. Launched September 2024, you can use your AirPods Pro 2 to detect if you have hearing loss. Make sure you\u2019re in a quiet room when taking the test\u2014the test will stop if it detects any noise. Fans, as I learned, do count as noise. But once completed, it can tell you if you have any kind of hearing loss. (I have no or mild hearing loss, according to the tests). If you do have hearing loss, they come with an FDA-approved Hearing Aid feature to help enhance your hearing.\nThe AirPods are also rated for IP54 water-, sweat- and dustproofing, so you can use them during workouts without worry. As for its battery life, it\u2019s on par with Apple\u2019s claim of 5.5 hours with ANC on, based on my testing (and six hour without). It\u2019s also a little more than the AirPods 4\u2019s four hours with ANC, too. It\u2019s not the best by far, but if you aren\u2019t taking them on an international flight, then they\u2019re perfectly fine for most needs.\nBest for:\n- Getting best-in-class audio quality\n- Adjusting your music exactly the way you want it\nSkip if:\n- You don\u2019t want giant discs in your ears\n- You don\u2019t want to spend hundreds on a pair of earbuds\nI\u2019ve tested countless earbuds, but it\u2019s not every day that I find a pair with sound that sets a new bar for audio quality. That\u2019s exactly what happened when I tried the Denon PerL Pro wireless earbuds. Yes, they look like giant discs and feel a little unwieldy in my ears. But in my estimation, the audio quality is comparable products in the $300 price range.\nInterestingly, Denon refers to the earbuds\u2019 ANC as the Immersion mode, and the earbuds \u201cscan\u201d your ears to customize the way it interacts with your ears. It sounds cool, and if you want more control over your personalization, you can, but I don\u2019t recommend it\u2014the scan works just fine, and it\u2019s designed for audiophiles that want to tinker with every single frequency.\nOnce I\u2019d completed the scan and switched modes, audio was something of a mixed bag. Ashnikko\u2019s songs sounded bass-heavy, while Florence and the Machine\u2019s catalogue sounded incredible. I could hear every layer with clarity, even with the bass feeling overpowered during \u201cDog Days Are Over.\u201d I also cross-tested with two other Florence songs, \u201cKing\u201d and \u201cCosmic Love,\u201d and found that for once I could clearly hear the bass on the former and every pluck of the harp on the latter. It was simply delightful.\nHowever, there are some minor caveats to consider before splurging on these. They look like giant discs stuffed into your ears, and for those who thrive on subtlety and sleekness, that may be off-putting. The other issue is the \u201cImmersion\u201d ANC mode: You can\u2019t control it. I\u2019ve found in my travels that the ANC could be improved, as it\u2019s not the strongest compared to the Bose QuietComfort Ultras or even the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.\nBest for:\n- Gaming on the go, on your phone, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck and more\n- Enjoying a Bluetooth or 2.4GHz connection\n- Getting spatial audio for gaming on the go\nSkip if:\n- You\u2019re not a gamer\n- You want multipoint connectivity\nWhen the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds launched, I took them on two flights to test them for my full-length review. Even after returning home, I found myself skipping my SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless headset in favor of these earbuds. SteelSeries nailed the comfort level right off the bat, offering three ear tips sizes to suit most needs, and the design fits snugly in my ear. Another key feature I appreciate is the physical button controls. It may sound surprising considering the industry shift to touch controls, but it\u2019s a huge factor on why I keep coming back to these as my main gaming headset. Simply put, there are no accidental touches if you brush your hair behind your ear during gaming.\nSteelSeries products, including the Arctis GameBuds, offer a special EQ software called Sonar. Typically installed on a PC, in this case, it also comes in the form of an app. Unfortunately, there\u2019s one big caveat for gamers, though: no multipoint connectivity. Still, I appreciate that I can use either Bluetooth or 2.4GHz (with a dongle) to connect to my devices, including my beloved Nintendo Switch.\nThe Arctis\u2019 audio for music is quite good, but its real claim to fame is its gaming audio. You get spatial audio for gaming in a compact, portable package. It\u2019s good enough that when battling in Far Cry 6, I can still hear movements clearly on one earbud versus the other. I can also hear the direction enemies move from\u2014that\u2019s very important as a gamer, and props to SteelSeries for factoring it into this compact package.\nAs earbuds, this pick doesn\u2019t quite rival the best gaming headsets when it comes to a truly immersive experience. Also, the battery life is underwhelming at 10 hours, since gaming headsets can pack in anything from 20 to 300 hours of use before needing a recharge. But in the realm of wireless earbuds, 10 hours is impressive, especially since most of the picks on my list can only go up to six or eight hours before requiring a recharge. All in all, given their price and the audio quality, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are an incredible product that I find myself using almost daily.\nA quick note: If you plan on using these with your PlayStation, you\u2019ll want the PlayStation model. It\u2019s an important distinction to help get the most out of the gaming features available on these earbuds. Also, SteelSeries released a limited edition \u201cGlorange\u201d color if you prefer a pop of color.\nBest for:\n- Listening to music while hearing the world around you\n- Getting high-quality audio without sticking anything into your ear canal\nSkip if:\n- You absolutely must have ANC\n- You don\u2019t want to clip anything onto your ear\nThe Bose Ultra Open earbuds combine two features that are essential to runners: A comfortable, nonslip fit for hours of comfortable wear, and an open audio environment that lets you hear the world around you. The earbuds clip onto your ear helix (the outer, curved part of your ear) so you can wear them for hours in comfort. While I didn\u2019t personally test this pair, they were (and continue to be) a top contender chosen by Forbes executive editor Dave Johnson, who has extensive experience testing, writing and editing in the tech world. \u201cThey are comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and they stay doggedly affixed to my ear no matter what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he says, adding that he uses them regularly in his workout routines. \u201cTraditional earbuds, like the Apple AirPods Pro, tend to work themselves loose when I\u2019m working out at the gym and I always need to fiddle with them to keep them from falling out while jogging on the treadmill. That\u2019s not a problem with the Ultra Open.\u201d\nThat said, the audio is where the Opens begin to lose some of their appeal, and for audiophiles, you\u2019ll want to decide whether it\u2019s worth that ever-so-slight downgrade. During testing, the earbuds held up really well against the competition. \u201cThe sound is rich and full, with excellent spatial audio, and I can still feel the bass even though a lot of it is just radiated away into the air around my ears,\u201d shares Johnson. But, it\u2019s important to note that the bass doesn\u2019t quite hit the same as compared with other earbuds, especially when compared to its sibling, the Bose QuietComfort Ultras.\nThe battery life is also surprisingly stellar for a first-gen design, which wowed our testers. \u201cI think Bose expects you to just leave these things clipped to your ears all day long, and the respectable battery life lets you do that,\u201d says Johnson. He regularly enjoys more than 7 hours of continuous runtime with spatial audio off (it dropped to around 4.5 hours with spatial audio on). And, if you\u2019re running low on battery, the accompanying case gets him an additional two full charges, too. Be sure to take a look at the new chilled lilac color, a Bose website exclusive; if I had to relive my life, I would have sprung for those pastel hues.\nBest for:\n- Listening to music while hearing the world around you on a budget\n- Getting a comfortable, affordable ear helix grip\nSkip if:\n- You absolutely must have ANC\n- You don\u2019t want to clip anything onto your ear\n- You want the absolute best audio\nThis year at the Consumer Electronics Show, an Anker PR rep handed me this pair of Soundcore AeroClips, telling me they had just launched. An offshoot to Anker, Soundcore is a budget-friendly line that promises to deliver big sound for less. I tossed them on my ears and essentially wore them nonstop for a few days, wearing out the eight-hour battery life to get a sense of how they performed.\nI was tickled pink by how delightful I found these open ear wireless earbuds. They\u2019re comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their bulk, which was surprising; like the Bose Ultra Opens, which are my pick for working out, the AeroClips also \u201cclip\u201d onto your ear helix (although, I also felt they rested on my ears a bit). I did note that sometimes I needed to adjust them with my glasses on, but that wasn\u2019t the end of the world. Bose still takes the cake in comfort, but I didn\u2019t mind wearing these for many hours.\nI was also very pleasantly surprised with the audio on these, but there\u2019s a caveat: Soundcore offers a Soundcore Signature preset that I find abysmal at best. As a classically trained musician, I believe music should be balanced and clear so you feel like you\u2019re smack dab in the action; too much bass, and it gets muddy, whereas an emphasis on treble frequencies can leave your audio sounding tinny. The Signature preset across a few Soundcore models varies greatly, and on the AeroClips, there was virtually no balance whatsoever. But, not all is lost here. I found the cinematic sound I sought with the Classical preset, which is the one I would recommend using.\nUltimately, open ear wireless earbuds at this price shouldn\u2019t sound this good, but Soundcore pulled it off\u2014and kudos to them, because I\u2019m impressed. Soundcore put a lot of thought and consideration into the AeroClips, and it shows in these earbuds. If you\u2019re looking for big sound on a small budget\u2014specifically if you want buds to use while running in the park , letting you listen to audio while also hearing outside noises\u2014this pair is hard to beat.\nOther Wireless Earbuds I Tested\nWhile my top picks represent some of the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, many others didn\u2019t quite make the cut. Below are 12 more models I tested, plus reasons why they didn\u2019t earn a spot on this list.\nShokz OpenDots One (Forbes Vetted score: 7.5 out of 10): The Shokz OpenDots One want to rival Bose and Soundcore. And when it comes to audio quality, it mostly does. Battery life is strong and they feel comfortable when clipped around my ear helixes for long periods of time. However, my biggest beef with these earbuds is they randomly pause\u2014and it\u2019s my curly hair, of all things, accidentally registering touch commands. If you have long hair, plan to wear it up. It just annoyed me.\nJLab Go Pods ANC (Forbes Vetted score: 8.5 out of 10): The JLab Go Pods ANC punch way above their weight\u2014so much that they almost nabbed the best budget pick for audio quality alone. Frequencies sounded more balanced than the OnePlus Buds 3, and I liked that the charging case also included a cable. There\u2019s also built-in hearing protection and an interval timer setting to help time workout sets. ANC could be better, which is why these didn\u2019t make the cut.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): Google did a stellar job upgrading its ANC from the previous generation, and the design feels comfortable even after long hours. I found them great for small ears, but for larger ears, plan to use the included large ear tips. Audio quality is excellent, too. Google Pixel users should just get these; it worked seamlessly with my current carry, the Google Pixel 9 Pro. They also come with Conversation Detection, so no need to manually turn off ANC when you have a quick chat.\nApple AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation (Forbes Vetted score: 8.5 out of 10): These AirPods have great audio quality despite a modest price tag. I pitted them against two earbuds\u2014the Denon PerL Pros and the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8s\u2014and I struggled to hear any audio quality differences among the three. That speaks pretty well about the audio fidelity that these affordable AirPods can output. It wasn\u2019t until I tested them on Florence and The Machine\u2019s \u201cCosmic Love\u201d that I spotted some subtle differences in the mids and basses. If you\u2019re looking for stability, the Apple AirPods Pro 2 have silicon ear tips to keep them more firmly in place and stronger ANC, but if you\u2019re not concerned with that, opt for this pair.\nOnePlus Buds 3 Pro (Forbes Vetted score: 8.5 out of 10): The OnePlus Buds 3 Pros are pretty darn good, but they don\u2019t fit into any specific category. Like my top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, they use the Melody app if you\u2019re not a OnePlus or iPhone user, but it\u2019s still a worthwhile pick. That said, if you\u2019re a OnePlus user, it\u2019s worth the upgrade to the Buds 3 Pro over the Buds 3.\nAudio-Technica ATH-CKS50TW2 (Forbes Vetted score: 7.5 out of 10): The ATH-CKS50TW2 earbuds excel at one thing: battery life. They can last up to 15 hours with ANC on, 25 without, and you get an extra 40 hours with the charging case. The audio, however, felt a little too muddy for my taste despite fiddling with the EQ. It\u2019s still pretty darn good though, and most users will be happy with this pair. It\u2019s also hard to argue with another huge boon to their build: physical buttons, which are quickly becoming a relic in earbud designs\u2014I personally love this choice.\nBowers & Wilkins Pi8 (Forbes Vetted score: 7 out of 10): I wanted to love these earbuds\u2014audio quality was on par with the Denon PerL Pros during my testing. However, both managing editor Emmy Favilla and I both had connectivity issues with two separate review units during our testing. For the price\u2014the highest of any I tested at $399\u2014that\u2019s unacceptable. If you can stomach that, you may have to put them back in the case once or twice before they work in your ears, then they\u2019re a good choice.\nJBL Tour Pro 3 (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): The JBL Tour Pro 3\u2019s audio quality is solid and the earbuds feel very comfortable and secure in my ears. Even on bass-heavy settings, I noticed the bass couldn\u2019t quite hit levels of other earbuds like the Technics and Bose. It also has a unique 1.5-inch touchscreen display to give you at-a-glance information, including volume, EQs, battery and more, which I enjoyed using to make quick adjustments. It also charges wirelessly, but expect it to get a bit warm. Still, while they\u2019re a great option, they didn\u2019t fit into any specific category.\nAcefast AceFit Open Ear (Forbes Vetted score: 9 out of 10): The Acefast AceFit Open Ear headphones felt so comfortable that I accidentally wore them into a doctor appointment without realizing they were still on. Audio quality is pretty good, and I appreciated the slim case which I felt was easier to slip into my joggers\u2019 pockets. And for $80, it\u2019s a great budget option for those that don\u2019t want to clip anything on their ear helix.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 (Forbes Vetted score: 8 out of 10): The latest earbuds from Beats were built for two kinds of people: Apple fans and fitness enthusiasts. These were the sturdiest pair of earbuds in that they didn\u2019t even shift on my ears. You can jump, dance or do cartwheels and they\u2019ll stay in place. The audio is good, and most people will be happy with it. That said, they don\u2019t offer any kind of EQ settings, and while it\u2019s a seamless pairing experience for Apple users, Android users need to download an extra app. Still, for workouts, this is a great pair to get.\nBeats Studio Buds (Forbes Vetted score: 8 out of 10): The Beats Studio Buds have one of the best colors and designs of my testing\u2014it incorporated a physical button, which feels increasingly like a rarity amongst a sea of touch controlled models. The audio was pretty good, but I noticed that other, more expensive options could hit those deep basses more accurately and with gusto. Still, these are a great midrange pick.\nOpenRock X Open-Ear Earbuds (Forbes Vetted score: 7 out of 10): One of the coolest perks about the OpenRock X earbuds is that they have an adjustable dual-center joint so you can get a customized fit on your ears. I found that no matter how I placed them on my ears, they didn\u2019t quite tighten properly. The case and the earbuds both feel sturdy, but I felt the audio quality fell short. Still, these would be a great open-ear option where you need more customization for a more comfortable fit.\nHow I Tested The Best Wireless Earbuds\nTo find the best wireless earbuds on the market, I put over a dozen pairs to the test, narrowing down options to top-rated brands like Bose, Sony and more. From there, I put my shortlist to the test.\nDesign\nThe best wireless earbuds should feel sturdily built, with a sleek design that feels comfortable in your ears. After all, if you\u2019re wearing them for an extended period of time, you shouldn't feel any discomfort. I also evaluated the design based on wireless charging versus wired only, case bulk and more.\nAudio Quality\nNo matter what genre you\u2019re listening to, your audio quality should have a reasonable balance of base, mids and treble frequencies. None of these frequencies should sound muddled or distorted during listening sessions, and so I looked for crystal clear clarity and smoothness amongst the frequencies. I cross-checked audio quality in each pair of wireless earbuds across a variety of songs, and I considered whether ANC and spatial audio changed the overall sound quality.\nSome of the genres that I listen to include alternative, rock, classical, audiobooks/podcasts and more. Specifically, some of the songs I tested each pair of wireless earbuds include:\n- Florence and the Machine\u2019s \u201cKing,\u201d \u201cCosmic Love\u201d and \u201cDog Days Are Over\u201d\n- Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s \u201cScheherezade\u201d\n- Ashnikkos\u2019 \u201cWorms\u201d and \u201cDaisy\u201d\n- Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe\u201d and \u201cRed Wine Supernova\u201d\n- Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cDreams\u201d and \u201cThe Chain\u201d\n- Fitz and the Tantrums\u2019 \u201c123456,\u201d \u201cLivin\u2019 For The Weekend,\u201d and \u201cI Just Wanna Shine\u201d\n- Grandson\u2019s \u201cEulogy\u201d and \u201cBury Me Face Down\u201d\n- The entire soundtracks to seasons one and two of the Netflix show Arcane\nBattery Life\nWhen you\u2019re listening to your music, you want to be able to listen for hours without interruptions. I tested these earbuds for 30 minutes each, logging battery light percentage at the beginning and at the end. I also cross tested this with the ANC on versus off to get a sense of whether each pair lived up to its claims.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted team has published hundreds of tech and electronic guides that leverage our hands-on testing and research, including audio stories for all of your listening needs like outdoor speakers and more.\n- Consumer tech and electronics editor Rebecca Isaacs has been involved in tech journalism for over six years. She has personally tested a most audio equipment, including wireless headphones and Bluetooth speakers.\n- Isaacs has also tested most of the latest smart wearables currently on the market, from the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses to the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds and more.\n- When she\u2019s not testing audio equipment and wearables, she\u2019s testing the best gaming TVs and TVs for bright rooms.\n- This story was reviewed by executive editor Dave Johnson, a veteran tech journalist who has authored nearly three dozen books on technology and photography. He\u2019s well-versed in the latest audio technology, regularly attends trade shows to learn about the latest audio trends and served as the host of the popular podcast Battlestar Recaptica.\n- Additional experts were tapped to share their unbiased insights for this story. In particular, Isaacs spoke with Tom Terronez, CEO of Medix Dental IT and CEO of Terrostar Interactive Media.\n- We regularly revisit this story to reevaluate product selections, add new testing insights and more. We updated this article in May 2025 to add a new best Apple wireless earbuds pick, the Apple AirPods Pro 2, and add more insights on how to choose a pair of wireless earbuds. We also added a few more wireless earbuds that we tested and didn\u2019t quite make the cut.\nHow To Choose The Best Wireless Earbuds\nWhen shopping for the best wireless earbuds, it\u2019s important to consider more than just price. The right pair depends on how you plan to use them, from commuting to working out and more. Here\u2019s what to keep in mind when choosing your next pair.\nSound Quality\nThe best wireless earbuds should deliver balanced audio with clear vocals, rich mids and punchy bass. They should also offer clear EQ presets or at the very least the option to customize your listening experience. They should sound smooth and clear across a variety of genres. \u201cWhether I am listening to Coltrane, Survivor, The Stylistics or Snoop Dogg; I want a clear, full sound with noticeable bass,\u201d Terronez says. Audiophiles should look for wireless earbuds that support high-quality codecs like AAC, aptX or LDAC.\nNoise Cancellation\nActive noise cancellation, also shortened to ANC, helps block out background sounds like engines, traffic, noisy neighbors and more. Active noise cancellation is also important for travel because it allows you to tune out the noise around you. Don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s not just about when you\u2019re listening; call and microphone quality with noise cancellation is also equally important. \u201cI need to be able to have clear calls on the go and that includes a microphone that removes most background noises,\u201d Terronez adds.\nMost wireless earbuds adapt to your environment and offer active noise cancellation, while others offer basic suppression with something called passive noise cancellation. If you need to be mindful of your surroundings, make sure that your next pair of wireless earbuds also offer transparency or ambient modes.\nBattery Life\nMost wireless earbuds provide anywhere from five to eight hours of playback per charge, and the charging case can typically extend the time to up to 20 to 30 hours. Some models also support fast charging, giving you an hour of playback in just a few minutes. Review the numbers and pay close attention to what your needs are. If you\u2019re taking multiple transcontinental or international flights, a longer battery life might be better. Otherwise, for commuters, this may not matter as much.\nFit and Comfort\nComfort can make or break your listening experience, especially if you wear earbuds for long periods or during your workouts. When it comes to comfort, \u201cthe tips make the single most significant difference,\u201d says Terronez. \u201cBose has always delivered with their tips,\u201d he adds. But if Bose isn\u2019t your preferred brand, look for models with multiple ear tip sizes or stabilizers to ensure a comfy fit. After all, a secure seal improves both your audio quality and any noise cancellation.\nAlternately, if you don\u2019t want to worry about ear tips, \u201cOpen earbuds essentially deliver audio without a tip in the ear canal,\u201d says Terronez. Because they clip onto your ear helix, there is a tradeoff: \u201cThe open earbuds could not seal out background noise to the same level as I am accustomed to,\u201d adds Terronez. Make sure you weigh the pros and cons of each type of earbud and your preferred comfort before you decide.\nExtra Features\nMany wireless earbuds offer touch or physical controls, access to voice assistants like Siri and Alexa and more. Higher-end models, like the AirPods Pro 2 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultras, also offer extras like wear detection, spatial audio or multipoint connectivity to switch between all your devices. Make sure you review what extra feature each wireless earbuds pair offers before making a decision."
