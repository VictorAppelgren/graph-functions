  "description": "Michael J. Fox \u2013 Marty McFly himself \u2013 discussed his life with Parkinson's and the legacy of \"Back to the Future\" 40 years after its release.",
  "content": "Forty years after \"Back to the Future's\" release, Michael J. Fox isn't done delighting fans.\n\nThe Emmy-winning actor, 64, on Aug. 10 attended a Southampton, New York, IMAX screening of the film that jump started his career on the big screen.\n\nThe crowd at the sold-out stayed afterward for his conversation with Southampton Playhouse's artistic director, Eric Kohn, with topics ranging from the twists in Fox's life and career over the past four decades \u2013 including his life with Parkinson's disease \u2013 to his work with his Michael J. Fox Foundation.\n\n\"Michael\u2019s insights into his relationship to acting, and how it changed \u2014 first via blockbuster success and then through his diagnosis \u2014 made for a conversation that was by turns emotional, endearing, and inspirational,\" Kohn wrote in an Aug. 12 Instagram post.\n\nThe Oscar-winning film from Robert Zemeckis was made on a $19 million budget and released in theaters on July 3, 1985. It went on to earn $224 million at the worldwide box office and has since become a Hollywood classic, even getting inducted into the Library of Congress' National Film Registry in 2007.\n\nFox reprised his role as teen Marty McFly, alongside Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, in two more \"Back to the Future\" movies.\n\nLloyd, 86, has also continued to appear in films and TV shows, most recently the second season of \"Wednesday\" and \"Hacks.\" He made a rare public appearance alongside wife Lisa Loiacono at the Hollywood premiere of his latest project, the Bob Odenkirk-starring \"Nobody 2,\" on Aug. 11.\n\nSince publicly revealing his Parkinson's diagnosis in 1998 \u2013 seven years after his diagnosis \u2013 Fox has continued to act in Hollywood while also advocating for and funding Parkinson's research through his foundation.\n\nIn January, President Joe Biden awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom as he \"warms hearts and captivates audiences as a fearless advocate for those with Parkinson's disease.\"\n\nThe fastest-growing neurodegenerative condition in the U.S., Parkinson\u2019s is an incurable brain disorder, a progressive disease \"that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination,\" according to the National Institute on Aging.\n\nOver the years, Fox has sustained multiple broken bones, including both arms, his shoulder, his orbital bone and cheek and his hand, which resulted in a serious infection.\n\nFox combats his symptoms, such as paralysis of his facial muscles, through medication and trains to preserve his ambulatory skills.\n\n\"One day I\u2019ll run out of gas,\" Fox told Town & Country magazine in 2023. \"One day I\u2019ll just say, 'It\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m not going out today.' If that comes, I\u2019ll allow myself that.\n\n\"Certainly, if I were to pass away tomorrow, it would be premature, but it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of. And so, no, I don\u2019t fear that.\"",

Fox, 63, joined Coldplay onstage to play guitar during the band's Glastonbury festival performance on Saturday.\nChris Martin took a moment to thank the \"Back to the Future\" star, who has Parkinson's disease and performed in a wheelchair.\n\"The main reason why we're in a band is because of watching 'Back to the Future,' so thank you to our hero forever, and one of the most amazing people on Earth, Mr. Michael J.

Marty performs \"Johnny B. Goode\" years before the song's debut, inspiring Chuck Berry to record it, and stuns the crowd into silence with his forward-looking guitar solo.\n\"I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet,\" McFly tells the flabbergasted audience, \"but your kids are gonna love it.\"\nOn \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" in 2022, Martin said this scene \"made me want to be in a band.\"\nAs Fox played the guitar at Glastonbury, Martin nodded to the movie's \"Johnny B. Goode\" scene by singing, \"Go, Johnny, go, go, go!\"\nThis isn't the first time Fox has performed with Coldplay. In 2016, he joined the band at a show in New Jersey to play \"Earth Angel\" and \"Johnny B. Goode,\" both songs from the \"Back to the Future\" school dance scene.

      "text": "A couple of years ago, Davis Guggenheim experienced a confounding emotion familiar to anyone who spends time with Michael J. Fox. The director was in Fox\u2019s Central Park West apartment, midway through his first day of interviewing the now 62-year-old actor and philanthropist for the 2023 biographical documentary Still.\nFox, who was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 1991, is not physically well, though he\u2019s lucky to be alive, having survived 33 years with an incurable degenerative disease that kills most patients within 20 years of diagnosis. In order to speak clearly, Fox takes pills to combat paralysis of facial muscles. The more the disease advances, the more medicine it takes to animate the muscles, until the inevitable point when the side effects outweigh the benefits of the medication, or it stops working altogether. One of the worst side effects of Fox\u2019s medication is dyskinesia\u2014involuntary movements and tics. So, while the constant bobbing and careering may appear distressing for Fox, it is in fact the best version of himself available. He regularly acknowledges that he\u2019s long into the journey he once referred to as the \u201cgradual paring away of my physical self.\u201d And yet, after listening to Fox explain his outlook on the world, Guggenheim had a realization that he had encountered a man who had achieved a spiritual state known to few. He felt the need to confess. \u201cI want what you have,\u201d Guggenheim told Fox.\nSoon the director called for a break. \u201cI walked 30 blocks to my hotel,\u201d Guggenheim recalls, \u201cand the whole time I was like, \u2018Why do I feel this way? He\u2019s got this really tough diagnosis. I don\u2019t. But he has something that I wish I had.\u2019 \u201d Fox recalls his rejoinder. \u201cI told him, \u2018Be careful what you wish for.\u2019 \u201d Still, Fox understands what Guggenheim was getting at. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve said Parkinson\u2019s is a gift. It\u2019s the gift that keeps on taking, but it has changed my life in so many positive ways.\u201d\nFox used to be a well-liked and funny TV and film star, a master pratfaller and teller of witty stories on talk show couches\u2014a virtuoso of a light art. In the last 20 years he has evolved into something deeper: a philosopher, an exemplar of courage, and the exceedingly rare figure in this polarized moment that a country can unite behind. In a recent CBC TV profile, the journalist Harry Forestell, who was himself diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in 2015, characterized Fox\u2019s example using words only a fellow Parkinson\u2019s patient could, calling Fox\u2019s public reckoning with the disease \u201cboth futile and deeply inspiring.\u201d He is not only an inspiration to Parkinson\u2019s patients through his public appearances and the candor of his four moving memoirs, he\u2019s also the co-founder of the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research, which in its 23 years has funded nearly $2 billion in research. He inspires not only his fans but his intimates. \u201cThey describe some people when playing a great sport as poetry in motion,\u201d says the novelist Harlan Coben, a close friend of more than a decade. \u201cMike\u2019s bravery in motion.\u201d\nFew would have predicted this trajectory. After winning a couple of acting credits as a kid, Fox dropped out of high school in Burnaby, British Columbia, at 17 and drove to Hollywood. There were a couple of lean years spent landlord-ducking and dumpster-diving before Fox landed Family Ties in 1982, which begat Back to the Future three years later. Untold fame and riches arrived overnight. During his go-go \u201980s run, he was by his own admission a conspicuous consumer, a luxury automobile collector who recalls being able to light a cigarette in his Ferrari going 100 mph. \u201cI\u2019m sure that if you talked to him when he decided to drop out of high school, move to Hollywood, and become a movie star, that he had no intention of doing anything other than making money and being famous,\u201d Guggenheim says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to make money, be famous, and inspire people.\u2019\u201d\nParkinson\u2019s didn\u2019t change Fox overnight. When he was diagnosed at 29, a doctor told him he probably had a decade before the symptoms would end his career. And by that point, as Fox admits in his 2002 book Lucky Man, his movie career was foundering. The Back to the Future franchise was over, and he\u2019d made a series of box office flops like Doc Hollywood and For Love or Money. The diagnosis sometimes felt like the karmic price for his success, \u201cthe bill being brought to a sloppy table after an ill-deserved and underappreciated banquet,\u201d as he wrote.\nFox hid his Parkinson\u2019s, collected checks for movies that felt beneath his talents, and hit the pillow hammered every night. Predictably, a breakdown followed. He went to his first AA meeting and got sober. He found a Jungian analyst named Joyce and confessed that he felt as if his life were \u201cin flames.\u201d Today he recalls the moment in the mid-\u201990s when he experienced an epiphany on Joyce\u2019s couch. \u201cMy therapist said, \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019 \u201d he recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Michael, you have Parkinson\u2019s! The other shoe dropped a long time ago.\u2019 \u201d\nDifficult days, Fox understood, lay ahead. There was no better option than to surrender to appreciating the gifts of the present day. His taxonomy of what mattered and what didn\u2019t was turned on its head. Family landed on top. Fox and his wife, the actress Tracy Pollan, had been married only three years before his diagnosis. Divorce following a Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis is common, yet Pollan stuck around.\n\u201cEverybody says \u2018in sickness and in health,\u2019 but sometimes it\u2019s not that easy,\u201d says the couple\u2019s friend Cam Neely, the former hockey star and longtime president of the Boston Bruins. \u201cEverybody thinks about what Mike goes through, but one can only imagine what Tracy goes through. You can just tell how much she loves him, but one thing about Tracy, she\u2019s a strong, tough woman, and doesn\u2019t put up with any BS.\u201d Fox had one request before he would allow Guggenheim to make a film about him. \u201cNo violins,\u201d he said, meaning no treacly music scoring scenes of his physical struggles. And Fox offered only one note after screening a rough cut of Still: \u201cMore family.\u201d Still\u2019s most affecting scenes are those of Fox collapsing in joyful laughter when Pollan or one of his four kids ribs him.\nFox kept his Parkinson\u2019s a secret until 1998, when he made an announcement to Barbara Walters and People. It was made under duress: The National Enquirer was close to breaking the story of the health issue that was affecting the schedule of Fox\u2019s sitcom, Spin City. Despite the circumstances, the unburdening brought unexpected joy\u2014and then an idea. \u201cWhen I went public, I felt like I stood there naked in the town square and said, \u2018Look at me. This is what it is,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realize was how many other people had been dying to do that.\u201d\nOvernight, various Parkinson\u2019s foundations clamored to land Fox as their spokesman. \u201cEarly on someone from a foundation gave me their pitch as to why I should come on,\u201d he says. Fox politely demurred, saying he appreciated the group\u2019s efforts. \u201cBut then they said the most unusual thing,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey said, \u2018But if you don\u2019t help us, don\u2019t help them,\u2019 pointing to another foundation. I got so mad. I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get in here and get this straightened out.\u2019\u201d\nIn 2000 he founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research with the goal of funneling money to scientists with the best shot of finding a cure. The monumental ambition of the mission didn\u2019t just occur to him. \u201cIt seemed straightforward to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a short kid from Canada who at 17 moved to another country and somehow within five years was a millionaire. I\u2019m of the mind that anything you want to do you can do.\u201d He went on a listening tour of scientists, politicians, and patient advocates. His conclusion: Foundations were mostly covering the unmet needs of patients while also lobbying the government to fund research. But despite these efforts the government wasn\u2019t coughing up enough money to make sufficient advances. \u201cThe science was ahead of the money,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just have to throw the money at the right people.\u201d\nTo find a CEO for his foundation, Fox met with candidate after highly qualified candidate from the nonprofit world, but he decided he wanted something different, someone who could innovate like a startup founder. After spending nine years making other people money at Goldman Sachs, Deborah Brooks was looking to do some good. \u201cI thought, Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if nonprofits were more efficient, if they were bolder?\u201d Brooks tells me. Fox hired her after one meeting; she\u2019s both co-founder and CEO.\nThe pair agreed on a revolutionary fiscal philosophy. While many foundations rely on an endowment model, amassing a nest egg designed to assure long-term survival by parceling out small percentages to recipients, Fox\u2019s foundation would attempt to go broke annually. \u201cThe goal is to go out of business,\u201d Fox has said. In 2020 the foundation brought in $199 million in private donations and the next year funded $233 million in grants. According to Brooks, after spending nearly $2 billion on research, the foundation in 2022 had allocated more on Parkinson\u2019s research than the U.S. government\u2014and it seems to be paying off. In April, Lancet Neurology published the results of a decadelong Fox foundation\u2013led study demonstrating that Parkinson\u2019s can now be detected in living people by locating a particular biomarker protein, abnormal alpha-synuclein, a discovery that has the potential to lead to a treatment that can delay, or even eliminate altogether, the onset of symptoms. \u201cWhen I was diagnosed, it was like a drunk driving test,\u201d Fox says. \u201cNow we can say, \u2018You have this protein, and we know that you have Parkinson\u2019s.\u2019 It opens the gates for pharmaceutical companies to come in and say, \u2018We\u2019ve got a target and we\u2019re going to dump money into it,\u2019 and when they dump money into it, good things happen.\u201d\nFor many years the ability to turn lemons into lemonade was Fox\u2019s brand. His 2009 memoir, Always Looking Up, was subtitled The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist. In 2018, when a spinal tumor unrelated to his Parkinson\u2019s threatened to paralyze him, he opted for surgery that required months of physical therapy to get him walking again. Freshly rehabilitated and finally on two feet, on a rare night alone in his apartment he tripped and did a header in the kitchen, breaking his upper arm. Fox recalls the words that he uttered while splayed on his floor: \u201cI said, \u2018Fuck lemonade. I\u2019m out of the lemonade business.\u2019 \u201d He chronicled his medical misadventures and attendant depression two years later in his book No Time Like the Future. \u201cThat was nothing,\u201d he says now. He has since broken his other arm and shoulder, smashed his orbital bone and cheek, and broken his hand. \u201cMy hand got infected and then I almost lost it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a tsunami of misfortune.\u201d\nBut Fox is smiling. There\u2019s no self-pity in the litany, more pride in showing off battle scars. He often refers to himself as a \u201ctough son of a bitch,\u201d a trait reflected by his daily training to remain ambulatory, despite the damage he faces from his now daily falls. I ask if anything scares him, and he thinks for a moment. \u201cAnything that would put my family in jeopardy,\u201d he says. He has nightmares about falling into Tracy or one of the kids on the street, and them getting hit by a bus. But fear for himself, the future, the ultimate other shoe dropping? Not so much.\n\u201cOne day I\u2019ll run out of gas,\u201d he says. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll just say, \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m not going out today.\u2019 If that comes, I\u2019ll allow myself that. I\u2019m 62 years old. Certainly, if I were to pass away tomorrow, it would be premature, but it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of. And so, no, I don\u2019t fear that.\u201d\nPhotography by Sebastian Kim.

      "text": "'Back to the Future' cast seeks help in search for red guitar\n\"Back to the Future\" co-creator Bob Gale described the red electric guitar as an important piece of cinema history and memorabilia.\nMarty McFly's iconic red guitar from the original \"Back to the Future\" is missing, and the movie's cast and filmmakers are asking for the public's help to bring it back to the present.\nMusical instrument chain Gibson uploaded a video on Tuesday, June 2, revealing the cherry red Gibson ES-345 guitar hasn't been seen since 1985, when the film premiered. The video featured several stars from the movie, including Michael J. Fox (Marty McFly), Lea Thompson (Lorraine Baines McFly), Christopher Lloyd (Dr. Emmett Brown) and Harry Waters Jr. (Marvin Berry).\n\"It's somewhere lost in the space time continuum, or it's in some teamster's garage,\" Fox said in the video. \"If you know where it is, if you know who has it, call us, text us. We need that guitar. I need it.\"\n\"Back to the Future\" co-creator Bob Gale said the electric guitar is an important piece of cinema history and memorabilia.\nIt's unclear who last had the instrument, with Lloyd saying \"somehow it's vanished,\" but added the team will be forever grateful for its return.\nWhere was the Gibson guitar last seen?\nThe team behind the sci-fi adventure film rented the Gibson guitar from Los Angeles business Norman\u2019s Rare Guitars and returned it to them following production, according to The Hollywood Reporter. However, \"Lost to the Future\" director Doc Crotzer and Gibson\u2019s Brand Experience Director, Mark Agnesi, clarified they have no clue where it is now.\n\"We\u2019ve been looking into leads and rumors for a long time, and as you can imagine, we\u2019re talking 40 years ago, so memories fade,\" Crotzer told the outlet. \"We weren\u2019t in the era of digital trails, or of receipts and things like that. There are conflicting reports too. You can find about as many different rumors as you can people.\"\nCrotzer and Agnesi said there have been many stories about where the guitar went, including the likely scenario that it was sold at the LA store. Yet, they are hoping the global search could lead to more concrete answers.\n\"I knew that guitar came from Norm\u2019s, the first day on the job, I was looking in cases,\" Agnesi told The Hollywood Reporter. \"Every time I\u2019d go to storage to Norm\u2019s warehouse, I was checking ES-cases to see if he still had it. I\u2019ve been looking since 2009, 15 years of looking for this thing. It\u2019s cool we\u2019re going to let the world know we\u2019re looking for it and everyone gets to join in.\"\nAnyone with information on the instrument's whereabouts is encouraged to submit a tip to the new Lost To The Future website or contact (855) 345-1955 through a text message or a phone call."

      "text": "Michael J. Fox calls breaking bones due to Parkinson's symptoms a 'tsunami of misfortune'\nMichael J. Fox knows a thing or two about resilience after living with Parkinson's Disease for 30 years.\nIn an interview with Town & Country magazine published Thursday, the \"Back to the Future\" actor, 62, detailed the injuries he's sustained in recent years, since breaking his upper arm while recovering from a risky spinal surgery to remove a noncancerous tumor in 2018. That fall was Fox's \"darkest moment,\" he told People magazine in 2020.\nYet \u201cthat was nothing,\u201d he said of the broken arm, which threatened Fox's pervasive optimism and inspired his 2020 memoir, \"No Time Like the Future: An Optimist Considers Mortality.\" Fox shared that he has broken his other arm and shoulder, smashed his orbital bone and cheek and broken his hand since that injury.\n\u201cMy hand got infected and then I almost lost it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tsunami of misfortune.\u201d\nFox, who takes pills that help him speak by combatting paralysis of his facial muscles, also trains daily to preserve his ambulatory skills, despite the risk of further injuries from daily falls. But he doesn't appear too concerned about it.\n\u201cOne day I\u2019ll run out of gas,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll just say, \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m not going out today.\u2019 If that comes, I\u2019ll allow myself that. I\u2019m 62 years old.\n\"Certainly, if I were to pass away tomorrow, it would be premature, but it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of. And so, no, I don\u2019t fear that.\u201d\nFox keeps moving despite frequent falling\nIn the documentary that came out earlier this year, \"Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie,\" Fox frequently falls while walking and incurs multiple injuries over the course of filming.\n\"People around me are going, 'Be careful, be careful,' \" Fox says. \"And I'm like: 'This has nothing to do with being careful. This happens.' \"\nFox was diagnosed with Parkinson's when he was 29 and publicly shared the news seven years later, in 1998.\nThe fastest-growing neurodegenerative condition in the U.S., Parkinson\u2019s is an incurable brain disorder, a progressive disease \"that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination,\" according to the National Institute on Aging.\n'Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie': Actor says he became an alcoholic, hid Parkinson's diagnosis\nBreaking his arm in 2018 was a 'breakthrough moment' for Michael J. Fox\nIn 2008, Fox published a book titled \"Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist.\" Ten years later, he started questioning his blind optimism after falling while recovering from surgery.\n\"I was lying on the floor in my kitchen with a shattered arm waiting for the ambulance to show up,\" Fox told USA TODAY in 2020. \"I kind of went, 'What an idiot. All this time you've been telling everybody to be optimistic, chin-up, and you're miserable now. There's nothing but pain and regret. There's no way to put a shine on this.'\"\nIt's this fall that kicks off Fox's book, \"No Time Like the Future: An Optimist Considers Mortality,\" in which the actor goes on to detail his harrowing recovery from spinal surgery, insights from his battle with Parkinson's disease and his return to positivity after, quite literally, falling into despair.\n\"That was a real breakthrough moment for me, because I realized that I've been selling that optimism to people for so long,\" he said. \"I believe it's true to my core, but it struck me that at that point I questioned it, and I questioned it really severely. And so the rest of the book is this journey through finding my way back with gratitude. And I think gratitude is what makes optimism sustainable.\"\nThrough his recovery, falling and then needing to recover again, Fox said he realized the importance of being realistic while still maintaining optimism.\n\"I think the first thing you have to do is accept if you're faced with a difficult situation,\" Fox said. \"And once I do that, that doesn't mean I can't ever change it. I can change it, but I have to accept it for what it is first, before I can change it. And I have to be real about it. And once I do that, then it opens all doors.\"\nThe Michael J. Fox Foundation has reportedly spent nearly $2 billion in Parkinson's research since being established in 2000. Earlier this year, the nonprofit announced the discovery of \"a monumental leap forward for our disease\": a spinal fluid test \u2013 which is in the clinical trial phase \u2013 that can detect early stages of Parkinson\u2019s in a person's cells.\nMichael J. Fox says sobriety after Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis was 'a knife fight in a closet'\nContributing: Charles Trepany, USA TODAY"
