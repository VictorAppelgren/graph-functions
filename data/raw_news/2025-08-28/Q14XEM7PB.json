  "description": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Union Station has \u201cfallen into disrepair\u201d when it should be a \u201cpoint of pride\u201d for the District of Columbia.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is taking management of Union Station away from Amtrak in the latest example of the federal government exerting its power over the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the takeover Wednesday alongside Amtrak President Roger Harris at Washington\u2019s main transportation hub during the launch of an updated version of the rail service\u2019s Acela train. The federal government owns Union Station, which is near the Capitol.\n\nDuffy said the station has \u201cfallen into disrepair\u201d when it should be a \u201cpoint of pride\u201d for the District of Columbia. He said the Republican administration\u2019s move would help beautify the landmark in an economical way and was in line with Trump\u2019s vision.\n\n\u201cHe wants Union Station to be beautiful again. He wants transit to be safe again. And he wants our nation\u2019s capital to be great again. And today is part of that,\u201d Duffy said.\n\nIt\u2019s Trump\u2019s latest attempt to put the city under his control. In recent weeks, Trump has increased the number of federal law enforcement and immigration agents on city streets while also taking over the Metropolitan Police Department and activating thousands of National Guard members. Last week, Trump said he wants $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington.\n\nDuffy said the federal government can do a better job managing the train station and attract more shops and restaurants and generate more revenue that will be used to pay for upgrades to the station, which opened in 1907. Since then, the cavernous Roman-columned building has been through multiple management changes and numerous ups and downs regarding its cleanliness, safety and state of repair.\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser said upgrading the transit hub that serves various rail lines and buses would be an \u201camazing initiative\u201d for the federal government to take on because the city cannot afford the cost.\n\n\u201cIt has suffered from not being able to get the money that it needs for the renovation,\u201d the Democrat said at a separate news conference.\n\nNational Guard troops have patrolled in and around Union Station ever since Trump announced the anti-crime effort this month. Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were shouted down by opponents of the federal intervention when they visited with troops there last week.\n\nDuffy had pressed Amtrak about crime at the station in a March letter to its chief operating officer and requested an updated plan on how it intended to improve public safety there.\n\nThe deputy transportation secretary, Steve Bradbury, cited a new roof and new public restrooms among $170 million in upgrades that he said are needed at the station.\n\nAmtrak\u2019s new high-speed train, the NextGen Acela, will start serving the Northeast Corridor on Thursday, said Harris, Amtrak\u2019s president. The trains can travel at speeds of up to 160 mph, about 10 mph faster than the Acela train it is replacing. Duffy and the officials from the Union Station event boarded one of the new trains afterward for an inaugural ride to New York\u2019s Penn Station.\n\nUnion Station has had a history of ups and downs during its nearly 120-year history.\n\nIn 1981, after rain started pouring through the ceiling, the National Park Service, which has jurisdiction over some of the area surrounding the station, declared the building unsafe. The station was closed for five years for renovation and President Ronald Reagan signed the Union Station Redevelopment Act to help fund and organize its comeback.\n\nMore recently, the building fell on relatively hard times during the COVID pandemic. Foot traffic plummeted after passengers shunned mass transit while multiple shops closed at the station. But the past three years have witnessed a bit of a comeback.\n\nThe station has occasionally been a magnet for homeless individuals seeking shelter inside or camping in tents on Columbus Circle in front of the building. The proliferation of tents prompted the Park Service to clear the encampment in front of the station in June 2022.\n\nControl and management of the physical building also have shifted over the years.",

The District of Columbia\u2019s status as a congressionally established federal district gives him a unique opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on reaction to President Trump\u2019s DC police takeover plan.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi will assume responsibility for Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, Trump said, as he also railed against potholes and graffiti in the city and called them \u201cembarrassing.\u201d The president did not provide a timeline for the control of the police department, but he\u2019s limited to 30 days under statute unless he gets approval from Congress.\nAs Trump spoke, demonstrators gathered outside the White House to protest his moves. And local officials rejected the Republican president\u2019s depiction of the district as crime-ridden and called his actions illegal.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said. \u201cThere is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia.\u201d\nSchwalb, a Democrat, said violent crime in the district reached historic 30-year lows last year and is down an additional 26% this year.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she would follow the law regarding the \u201cso-called emergency\u201d even as she indicated that Trump\u2019s actions were a reason why the District of Columbia should be a state with legal protections from such actions.\n\u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d Bowser said.\nCombating crime\nThe president dismissed the idea Washington needed to enlarge its 3,500-officer police force, even as he seeks to have more armed personnel going through the city with the goal of reducing crime.\n\u201cWhat you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them,\u201d he said.\nTrump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in an executive order to declare a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d so his administration could take over the city\u2019s police force. He signed a directive for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard.\nWhile Trump has portrayed himself as a friend to law enforcement and enjoyed the political backing from many of their groups, he pardoned or commuted the sentences of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, including people convicted of assaulting police officers.\nAbout 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation\u2019s capital as part of Trump\u2019s effort to combat crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.\nMore than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Marshals Service are contributing officers.\nThe person was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately have a comment Monday morning.\nThe National Guard\nBowser, a Democrat, has previously questioned the effectiveness of using the National Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. Superior Court, some of which have been open for years.\nBowser cannot activate the National Guard herself, but she can submit a request to the Pentagon.\n\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d acknowledging it is \u201cthe president\u2019s call about how to deploy the Guard.\u201d\nBowser noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. She stressed during a Monday news conference that she believed Trump\u2019s views of the city were shaped by the \u201cchallenging times\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic, when he faced protests and crime spiked as the country began to recover from the outbreak.\nFocusing on homelessness\nTrump has emphasized the removal of Washington\u2019s homeless population, though it was unclear where the thousands of people would go, and he did not give details at his news conference Monday.\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday in a social media post. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d\nJesse Rabinowitz, a advocate for homeless people, called Trump\u2019s plan \u201cfascist\u201d and a \u201cwaste\u201d of resources. He said the move wasn\u2019t about safety.\n\u201cIt is about power, and it is about fascism and authoritarianism,\u201d said Rabinowitz, the campaign and communication director for the National Homelessness Law Center. \u201cIf Donald Trump wanted to keep D.C. safe, he would fund housing and support. Instead, the Republicans just gutted health care, and they\u2019re passing through a budget that will make homelessness worse. They do not care about helping people.\u201d\nCrime statistics\nPolice statistics show homicides, robberies and burglaries are down this year when compared with this time in 2024. Overall, violent crime is down 26% compared with this time a year ago.\nThe president has criticized the district as full of \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime,\u201d and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency. Police arrested two 15-year-olds in the attempted carjacking and said they were looking for others.\n\u201cThis has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst run place in the country,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\nHe called Bowser \u201ca good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly suggested the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining.\nBowser acknowledged the law allows the president to take more control over the city\u2019s police, but only if certain conditions are met.\n\u201cNone of those conditions exist in our city right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Ashraf Khalil, Alanna Durkin Richer, Nathan Ellgren, Darlene Superville and Michelle L.

      "text": "National Guard troops on DC streets for Trump\u2019s crackdown will start carrying guns\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday visited law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington Thursday evening, praising them for their role in his crime crackdown and saying he\u2019ll seek congressional funding for his DC intervention and beautification plans.\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard troops to start carrying firearms while patrolling the streets of Washington for President Donald Trump\u2019s law enforcement crackdown, the Pentagon said Friday.\nThe Defense Department didn\u2019t offer any other details about the new development or why it was needed. Hegseth referred to it as \u201ccommon sense\u201d on social media.\nNo troops have been spotted yet with firearms around the city in the hours after the announcement. But the decision is an escalation in the Republican administration\u2019s intervention in the nation\u2019s capital and comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members have been stationed in the heavily Democratic city.\nSome local officials were harshly critical, with D.C. Councilmember Charles Allen saying Trump\u2019s actions are \u201cnot of a president, but of someone on the march to an authoritarian takeover.\u201d\nTrump initially called up 800 members of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to crack down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration. Since then, six Republican-led states have sent troops to the city, growing the military presence.\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the deployment will last.\n\u201cIf I have to, I\u2019ll declare a national emergency, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to do,\u201d Trump said.\nHe suggested that he could take a similar approach in other cities, such as Chicago and maybe New York.\n\u201cAfter we do this, we\u2019ll go to another location, and we\u2019ll make it safe also,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. Referring to Chicago as \u201ca mess,\u201d he said, \u201cthat will be our next one after this.\u201d\nNational Guard troops are visible around Washington\nThere were no signs that the National Guard\u2019s role in D.C. would be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station and helping with crowd control.\nSome troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passers-by, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no overt indications that they have faced threats that would require weapons.\nD.C. Councilmember Christina Henderson said Trump was \u201cinviting confrontation where there doesn\u2019t need to be any.\nTrump has boasted that the city is safer than ever because of his intervention. He told reporters Friday that \u201cit\u2019s a miracle what\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\u201cD.C. was a hellhole,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s safe.\u201d\nHe suggested that he could prolong the deployment of troops and federal agents in Washington.\n\u201cThe big question is how long do we stay?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if we stay, we want to make sure it doesn\u2019t come back. So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out.\u201d\nTrump said he would ask Congress for $2 billion to improve the appearance of the city, including resurfacing roads and replacing streetlights. He\u2019s previously pledged to improve the grass to look like one of his golf courses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be safe, and it\u2019s going to be beautified,\u201d he said.\nTrump\u2019s decision to seek more money for sprucing up Washington comes months after the Republican-controlled Congress passed legislation that essentially forced a $1.1 billion budget cut on the city. Local leaders have pleaded for a fix, but to no avail.\nAdding armed troops to a city already on edge\nTensions have flared at times in the streets of D.C. since Trump\u2019s intervention began, especially involving federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement. Some fear arming the National Guard could exacerbate the situation.\nAlex Wagner, a former chief of staff to the Army secretary and assistant secretary for the Air Force during Democratic administrations, said asking troops to carry firearms is a \u201crecipe for disaster.\u201d\nHe said most National Guard members don\u2019t have the right training for Trump\u2019s law enforcement crackdown and are being put in a \u201cno-win situation.\u201d\n\u201cDo they have any role that would require them to have firearms? No,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Wagner said, if there are confrontations, \u201cthe White House can spin that to their political advantage.\u201d\nProtests have occasionally popped up around the city since the intervention began, with the largest of them attracting a few hundred people.\nCity officials are in a difficult position\nThe city\u2019s police department and the offices of Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb were notably silent when asked for comment about the National Guard decision.\nAs a federal district, the city government\u2019s powers are broadly delegated to it by Congress, providing few avenues to formally resist Trump\u2019s plans. Local officials have been walking a tightrope between acknowledging constituents\u2019 concerns and antagonizing Trump, who has threatened even more aggressive action toward D.C.\nCity Council Chair Phil Mendelson wrote on social media that he had discussed the effects of \u201cthe so-called crime emergency\u201d and other topics at a town hall Thursday night, while Council Member Brianne Nadeau posted a link to report police misconduct to city officials.\nThe city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nSpokespeople for the District of Columbia National Guard and a military task force overseeing all the guard troops in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\nD.C. schools are scheduled to start the new year Monday, and the district sent a message to parents letting them know that law enforcement action on school grounds can only take place \u201cwith a valid warrant or a court order.\u201d The statement also said officers in schools aren\u2019t working with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Ashraf Khalil and Anna Johnson contributed to this report."

Anger and frustration dotted the city as the vice president lauded an operation that he asserted has \u201cbrought some law and order back.\u201d\nThe tense situation, which began more than a week ago when Trump took control of the local police department, appeared primed for escalating confrontations between residents who say they feel under siege and federal forces carrying out the president\u2019s vision of militarized law enforcement in Democratic cities. Other residents have said they welcome the federal efforts as a way to cut crime and bolster safety.\nAs Trump ratcheted up the pressure, Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared burgers with soldiers at the city\u2019s main railroad hub as demonstrators gathered nearby. The appearance, a striking scene that also included White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, illustrated the Republican administration\u2019s intense dedication to an initiative that has polarized the Democratic-led city.\n\u201cYou guys are doing a hell of a job,\u201d Vance told the troops assembled in the Union Station Shake Shack. While protest chants echoed through the restaurant, he rejected polling that shows city residents don\u2019t support the National Guard deployment as a solution to crime.\nSomeone booed Vance loudly and repeatedly as he left. The vice president grinned and said, \u201cThis is the guy who thinks people don\u2019t deserve law and order in their own community.\u201d\nTrump has already suggested replicating his approach to D.C. in other cities, such as Chicago and Baltimore. He previously deployed the National Guard and the Marines in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests.\nSwaths of the city are on edge\nIn the seven months since Trump took office for the second time, the traditionally liberal city of Washington has buckled under his more aggressive presidency. Thousands of federal employees have been laid off, landmark institutions like the Smithsonian are being overhauled on grounds of doctrine, and local leaders have been increasingly wary of angering the commander-in-chief.\nNow parts of the city are bristling with resentment over Trump\u2019s approach. Spectators chanted \u201c free D.C. \u201d at a soccer game. Residents share sightings of immigration agents to help migrants steer clear. In the Columbia Heights neighborhood, crowds jeered federal officers and flipped middle fingers as they drove away. On some nights, people bang pots and pans outside their front doors in a cacophonous display of defiance.\nLess than a mile from the U.S. Capitol, an armored National Guard vehicle collided with a civilian car in the early morning Wednesday, trapping the driver inside until emergency crews arrived. The massive military transport, designed to withstand improvised explosive devices in war zones, towered over the crushed silver sport utility vehicle. Bystanders gathered.\n\u201cYou come to our city and this is what you do? Seriously?\u201d a woman yelled at the troops in a video posted online.\nMore troops have been arriving in the city, many from six Republican-led states. An estimated 1,900 are being deployed in total, with most posted in downtown areas like the National Mall, metro stations and near the park where baseball\u2019s Washington Nationals play.\nIn addition, federal officers from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies have circulated through D.C. to make arrests.\nAnd a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia said 20 members of the military\u2019s Judge Advocate General Corps would begin helping prosecute cases.\nCol. Larry Doane, the commander of the joint task force in the D.C. National Guard, said they\u2019re trying to provide \u201can extra set of eyes and ears\u201d for police and \u201chelping them maintain control of the situation.\u201d\n\u201cThis is our community, too,\u201d Doane said.\nThat\u2019s not how D.C. native LaVerne Smalls, 46, feels. \u201cIt\u2019s very different. It\u2019s very quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like it. It should be full of life.\u201d\nSmalls knows D.C. has struggled with crime, but she didn\u2019t used to feel worried walking around. \u201cI feel even more threatened,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s how they want us to feel.\u201d\nThe actions from law enforcement have occasionally veered beyond safety and crime reduction and into regulating expression. Over the weekend, masked agents took down a profane protest banner in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood \u2014 to the apparent delight of the administration, which posted a video of the incident online. \u201cWe\u2019re taking America back, baby,\u201d one of the agents said in the video.\nCorey Frayer, 42, who lives nearby, said \u201cthat sends a message.\u201d\n\u201cMount Pleasant has always been a very activist, outspoken neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think they think if they can show up here and scare us, then they\u2019ll have done their job.\u201d\nArrests are increasing as local officials navigate the situation\nThe White House said more than 550 people have been arrested so far, and the U.S. Marshals are offering $500 rewards for information leading to additional arrests. \u201cTogether, we will make DC safe again!\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media. City statistics show crime was already declining before Trump\u2019s intervention, despite his claims of a crisis necessitating the federal takeover of the D.C. police department.\nThe number of people arrested each day in Washington has increased by about 20% since the government began sending in a surge of federal agents, according to law enforcement data.\nOn average, there were 78 people booked in the city jail in the first 10 days, compared with 64 in the 10 days before that. Those numbers don\u2019t include immigration arrests, though they do include arrests by both local police and federal officers, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss data that has not been publicly released.\nPolicing experts say it\u2019s tough to draw firm conclusions over such a short period of time, especially since increases in police presence can relocate crime instead of preventing it.\nExtending federal control of the city police department would require congressional approval, but Vance suggested the decision ultimately rests with Trump. \u201cIf the president of the United States thinks that he has to extend this order to ensure that people have access to public safety, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019ll do,\u201d he said.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged the militarized backdrop in the city as she attended a back-to-school event with teachers and staff. She said it\u2019s important that children \u201chave joy when they approach this school year,\u201d which starts Monday.\nBowser has been measured but directly critical of the federal operation, saying officers should not be wearing masks and arguing that the National Guard should not be used for law enforcement. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should have an armed militia in the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, the skewer-everyone cartoon television show \u201c South Park,\u201d which has leaned into near-real-time satire in recent years, this week made the federal crackdown fodder for a new episode. Last month, the show\u2019s 27th-season premiere mocked the president\u2019s body in a raunchy manner and depicted him sharing a bed with Satan.\n____\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer, David Bauder and Michelle Price contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump\u2019s administration has taken control of Washington\u2019s Union Station, citing disrepair and a desire to beautify the landmark, and announced a federal takeover of the city\u2019s police department amid a broader crackdown on crime and homelessness. The move comes alongside a deployment of National Guard troops and federal law\u2011enforcement officers, with Trump seeking congressional funding for city beautification and claiming the city is unsafe. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, criticize the takeover as unnecessary and unlawful, noting crime rates are actually falling. The federal intervention has sparked protests and raised concerns about militarization of the capital, while the administration promotes its actions as restoring safety and pride in the capital\u2019s infrastructure.",
