  "description": "Police found criminology books, cleaning supplies and graded papers in Bryan Kohberger's apartment after he killed four University of Idaho students in Moscow.",
  "content": "Idaho State Police have released hundreds of additional images taken during their investigation into college murderer Bryan Kohberger, giving the first public glimpse of his spartan apartment in Pullman, just across the state line at Washington State University.The images show he left few belongings behind, including cleaning supplies, books on crime and some of his school essays \u2013 plus a closet full of white and blue button-down shirts and some other odds and ends. Police found seven parking tickets, a disciplinary letter from the university and birthday cards addressed to \"Bryern.\"He was studying for a Ph.D. in criminology when he snuck into a six-bedroom house in Moscow, Idaho, and killed four University of Idaho students, three of whom were believed to be asleep when he stabbed them.IDAHO MURDER DOCUMENTS REVEAL VICTIM'S STALKING FEARS AND KOHBERGER'S 'INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR' AT SCHOOLBooks police found in his apartment include one called \"Unsafe in the Ivory Tower: The Sexual Victimization of College Women.\" Another, which Kohberger wrote about for an assignment, is called \"Why the Innocent Plead Guilty and the Guilty Go Free.\"Although he is a vegan, the photos show he kept a shaker of Parmesan cheese in his pantry.INSIDE THE HORROR: IDAHO FOUR CRIME SCENE PHOTOS REVEAL BLOODY AFTERMATH OF ATTACKPolice also recovered a stack of graded papers he wrote for criminal justice courses \u2013 critical of the death penalty and supportive of progressive prosecutors. In one, he asserted that \"local police officers are undertrained,\" prompting his professor to circle it and ask if that was, \"assumption or fact?\"Dr. Katherine Ramsland, a renowned criminologist and one of Kohberger's professors from his time obtaining a master's degree at DeSales University in Pennsylvania, said his graduate work appeared \"pretty ordinary.\"BRYAN KOHBERGER PLEADED GUILTY TO IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS, BUT THESE KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED\"It looks like they were assigned,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Like that undergrad paper the prosecutor had. So nothing of psych interest, if assigned.\"But the grades he received may be more telling. Some were in the low 80s.\"When I give a score like that to a grad student, it\u2019s a warning,\" Ramsland said. IDAHO MURDERS TIMELINE: BRYAN KOHBERGER PLEA CAPS YEARSLONG QUEST FOR JUSTICEAccording to other evidence released after Kohberger's sentencing in late July, he was the subject of complaints from undergrad students and was set to lose his campus job as a teaching assistant. Other images show his bathroom \u2013 with no shower curtain and an empty garbage bin, details that police noted in previously released warrant returns. Police seized receipts, a single black rubber glove and his desktop computer.BRYAN KOHBERGER ACCEPTS PLEA DEAL IN IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS CASEA week before the murders, he got an envelope labeled \"official ballot material\" from local officials.In his closet, he had only a few blue and white button-down shirts. Alongside some mail and a package of toilet paper, police found a box for a field compass. Another shipping box had an unopened can of \"inert\" bear spray.Police previously said in court documents that they found nothing of evidentiary value in Kohberger's campus office, which he shared with two other Ph.D. students. Photos show a mostly empty desk, save for a couple of textbooks, and Kohberger's name written on a dry-erase board alongside some notes and redacted materials. It's not clear how useful the evidence they took from his apartment turned out to be \u2013 aside from possibly the hard drive in his PC. Experts from the digital forensics firm Cellebrite told Fox News Digital last month that they were given his phone and a single computer drive to examine.From those devices, they saw he attempted to cover up his movements on the night of the murders and wiped a month's worth of browser history \u2013 but he also spent that Christmas reading up on serial killers, took numerous \"American Psycho\" style selfies and had only 18 contacts in his phone while only keeping in touch with his immediate family. Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one of felony burglary in July, weeks before he would have gone to trial for the murders of Xana Kernodle, 20, Ethan Chapin, 20, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Madison Mogen, 21.The plea deal spared him from the potential death penalty, which prosecutors said they would seek if he were convicted. He waived his rights to appeal and to seek a sentence reduction in exchange for four consecutive terms of life in prison with no parole, plus another 10 years.He is being held at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution, where he is in protective custody in a wing known as J Block, which also houses death row inmates, including fellow murderer Chad Daybell.",

      "text": "Idaho State Police have released more than 500 pages of documents compiled during their investigation of the University of Idaho student murders and into killer Bryan Kohberger.\nThey include dozens of witness interviews, photographs and other evidence obtained before and after Kohberger's arrest \u2013 from the start of the investigation when they had few leads to the end, after Kohberger was already in custody and police had DNA linking him to the scene.\nSome of the interviews shed new light on the victims as well as Kohberger's mindset before the slayings.\nA fellow graduate student at Washington State University, where Kohberger was pursuing a Ph.D. in criminology, told state detectives that Kohberger butted heads with classmates and faculty.\nIDAHO MURDERS TIMELINE: BRYAN KOHBERGER PLEA CAPS YEARSLONG QUEST FOR JUSTICE\nKohberger was rude and condescending toward women whose field of study focused on \"sexual burglary,\" she said, and other people in the department pegged him as a potential \"incel\" (involuntary celibate) and \"possible future rapist.\" However, she told police, they did not suspect he was the killer.\nMark my word, I work with predators. If we give him a Ph.D. that's the guy that in that many years when he is a professor, we will hear is harassing, stalking, and sexually abusing\u2026his students at wherever university\u2026\nShe said he expressed interests in \"the emotions of what it felt like when committing a crime\" and \"how offenders might avoid getting caught.\"\nKohberger had also briefly discussed the murders, which happened 10 miles away in Moscow, Idaho, with his peers, calling them \"horrible.\" He suggested that \"maybe it was a one and done type of thing,\" according to the documents.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER PLEADED GUILTY TO IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS, BUT THESE KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED\nThere were other red flags.\nAccording to one person interviewed by police, Kohberger told a disabled classmate that his project partner needed to be \"physically perfect\" and that her disability \"would not be acceptable.\"\nAt one point, a professor had to escort a female WSU student to her car because Kohberger's \"behavior was of concern.\" The school received more than a dozen complaints about his conduct, including reports of \"inappropriate behavior.\"\nThe documents also delve into concerns from Kaylee Goncalves, 21, one of the four victims, who said she believed she spotted someone stalking her from the tree line outside the house at 1122 King Road, just steps from the University of Idaho campus.\nIn one incident, she believed a man was staring at her from next to a dumpster in the street near their house. In another, she told friends that a man followed her to her car in the parking lot at a nearby WinCo grocery store, then tried to open her door after she got in.\nINSIDE THE HORROR: IDAHO FOUR CRIME SCENE PHOTOS REVEAL BLOODY AFTERMATH OF ATTACK\nAt another point, someone broke into Goncalves' parked car, moved some of her personal belongings, including lip gloss, placed her suitcase in the street and stole her underwear.\nAccording to one interview, a WSU faculty member told police that a grad student there reported that her apartment had been burglarized in the weeks before the murders \u2013 and someone stole \"intimate items\" including her perfume and underwear.\nThe professor said she raised Kohberger's red flags with other colleagues in a meeting about his future in the program.\n\"He is smart enough that in four years we will have to give him a Ph.D.,\" she said, according to police records. \"Mark my word, I work with predators, if we give him a Ph.D. that's the guy that in that many years when he is a professor, we will hear is harassing, stalking, and sexually abusing of his, I thought would be his, you know, his students at wherever university he ended.\"\nShe also said that Kohberger's research on burglars differentiated \"sexually motivated burglars\" from \"regular burglars.\"\nThe other victims were Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNext to Mogen's left hip, police found what would turn out to be a crucial part of the case \u2013 a tan leather Ka-Bar knife sheath with Kohberger's DNA on the snap, left behind on the victim's tan comforter in her third-story bedroom.\nKohberger ultimately pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and another of felony burglary weeks before he would have gone to trial. The plea deal avoided the death penalty, and Kohberger received four consecutive sentences of life with no parole plus another 10 years. He waived his rights to appeal and to seek a sentence reduction.\nThis is a developing story.

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger, the former criminology Ph.D. student who killed four University of Idaho undergrads in a 4 a.m. home invasion ambush, is complaining to prison guards that other inmates are threatening to sexually assault him and pleading for a transfer to another wing of the prison, according to a new report.\nThe 30-year-old Pennsylvania native has asked to meet with the deputy warden and is requesting his cell be moved to a quieter wing called B Block, according to a handwritten \"resident concern form\" first obtained by People.\nThe handwriting appears similar to other samples of Kohberger's previously released in court.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER VIDEO CIRCULATING ONLINE SPARKS PROBE INTO POSSIBLE PRISON LEAK, OFFICIALS SAY\nHe made his first complaint on his second day in J Block, which is for high-profile, high-risk prisoners, including death row inmates like Chad Daybell.\nLess than a week later, he reportedly complained again that another prisoner told him, \"I'll b--- f--- you\" and told guards someone else warned him, \"The only a-- we'll be eating his Kohberger's.\"\nState prison officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIDAHO KILLER BRYAN KOHBERGER COMPLAINS TO GUARDS ABOUT INMATE TAUNTS WITH TARGET ON HIS BACK: REPORT\nA guard reportedly remembered hearing \"vulgar language being used\" but could not recall the specifics.\n\"As I continue the SPI phase, I wish to discuss if I may be transferred to another ad-seg setting,\" Kohberger wrote, using prison lingo for \"administrative segregation\" \u2013 the type of protective housing that keeps him separated from the same inmates allegedly lobbing threats.\n\"Not engaging in any of the recent flooding/striking, as well as being subject to minute-by-minute verbal threats/harassment on that and other bases (sic), tier 2 of J-block is an environment that I wish to transfer from if possible,\" Kohberger wrote. \"I request transfer to B block immediately. I wish to speak with you soon.\"\nFlooding is a prison term referring to clogging sinks, toilets or other fixtures in order to force water to flood. It was not immediately clear what he meant by striking. It could mean a physical hit, refusal to work, or a disciplinary term.\nPrison officials have given no indication that they plan to move him, and his housing status still listed him in J Block as of Wednesday morning.\nExperts, however, warn Kohberger arrived at the prison with a target on his back.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe killer is reputed to be lacking in social skills \u2013 illustrated by what his attorneys called a \"piercing stare\" and lack of social awareness in court filings. Over the past two and a half years of confinement, he appears to have lost some weight, too.\nAccording to documents made public by the Moscow Police Department in Idaho, Kohberger already has a track record of bumping heads with his fellow inmates. On one occasion, Kohberger turned away from a video chat with his mom to snap at an inmate who yelled \"you suck\" at a jailhouse TV set. Another inmate described him as a \"f---ing weirdo\" and claimed he would have assaulted him if he wasn't worried about repercussions."

      "text": "Authorities released haunting photos showing scenes within the off\u2011campus residence at 1122 King Road in Moscow, Idaho, where four University of Idaho students were murdered in November 2022 by Bryan Kohberger.\nThe photos, taken by the Moscow Police Department (MPD), and obtained by NBC News, captured the scene after Kohberger went on a killing rampage against Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER'S IDAHO MURDER SCENE UNVEILED THROUGH DETAILED 3D REPLICA AFTER DEATH PENALTY STRUCK\nThe interior of the home was captured frozen in time following the quadruple murders, with a blood-stained pink blanket, a teddy bear and scattered personal items. One eerie photo captured a large handprint on the window of the three-storied home.\nAmong the 200 photos released by the MPD, spatters of blood stained the interior walls and floors as the lasting marks of a horrific confrontation.\nThe photos are the latest investigative piece released after Judge Steven Hippler released the gag order.\nPolice documents revealed that Goncalves and Mogen were found together side by side.

      "text": "Idaho State Police have released hundreds of photos from their investigation into the University of Idaho student murders and their perpetrator, Bryan Kohberger, including images that show the former criminology Ph.D. student's infamous white Hyundai Elantra after it was seized from his parents' driveway in Pennsylvania.\nWhile the exterior appears to be filthy, images from inside appear to show a white substance covering the steering wheel, dashboard, center console and other parts of the interior.\nExperts say it could be soap or bleach if Kohberger attempted to clean up evidence from inside the vehicle or residue left over from fingerprinting or other crime lab testing.\nIDAHO POLICE CHIEF REVEALS NEW DETAILS ABOUT BRYAN KOHBERGER STUDENT MURDER INVESTIGATION\n\"The Locard\u2019s Exchange Principle, the theory of transfer between objects, is something that every criminal justice student knows about,\" Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD cold case investigator and a criminal justice professor at Penn State Lehigh Valley, told Fox News Digital.\n\"I find it difficult to believe that Kohberger wouldn\u2019t have prepared his vehicle ahead of time to minimize the chance of it. I don\u2019t care if he was wearing a suit of armor, he would have had evidence on his outermost garments.\"\nSince the photos were taken after the driver's seat and door panel were removed, the substance could also have been left by investigators. If police didn't put it there, the crime lab would have tested the substance to be sure, he said.\nState police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\"The only thing is, why would you be dusting fingerprints in his car?\" asked Carlos Pantoja, a former NYPD crime scene investigator. \"I could see for blood, yes, we would swab a car for DNA.\"\nInvestigators ultimately did not find DNA from any of the victims inside the vehicle, according to previously released court documents.\nAnother blue substance photographed inside the house appears to be Amino Black, he said, which police use to find fingerprints and blood without damaging underlying DNA.\nINSIDE THE HORROR: IDAHO FOUR CRIME SCENE PHOTOS REVEAL BLOODY AFTERMATH OF ATTACK\nOther images include scenes from inside and outside the crime scene at 1122 King Road, which was a six-bedroom, off-campus rental house. It was torn down.\nKohberger killed four people inside: 21-year-old best friends Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, and 20-year-olds Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, who were dating.\nThe state police photos show a typical off-campus residence, albeit a little on the unkempt side, with cases of alcohol littering the common areas, a folding table set up for beer pong and empty cans on the floor.\nOn the floor next to the table is a med kit, left by someone from the Moscow Police Department.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER PLEADED GUILTY TO IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS, BUT THESE KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED\nThe murders happened around 4 a.m. on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2022, shortly before the Thanksgiving break and hours after the roommates returned home from nights spent drinking heavily with friends.\nHandprints on the windows were not connected to the case, authorities said previously.\nOn top of the microwave was a half-eaten box of fries from Jack in the Box. Nearby is a bag from a delivery order addressed to \"Xana.\"\nIn the living room, next to a wall covered in string lights, there's a flag on the wall that says \"Saturdays are for the girls.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe photos do not show rooms where the murders took place. Mogen's mom and both of Chapin's parents have asked a judge to block the release of images from inside the bedrooms, and the court issued a temporary restraining order.\nA hearing on the matter scheduled for Thursday has been pushed back to next week.\nKohberger is serving four consecutive life prison sentences plus another 10 years at the Idaho Maximum Security Institute, where he has been complaining about the food and alleged harassment from other inmates.\nFox News' Jamie Vera contributed to this report."

      "text": "BOISE, Idaho \u2013 The long\u2011running University of Idaho homicide case has reached a decisive turn: Bryan Kohberger, the former Washington State University criminology Ph.D. student accused of killing four undergraduates in 2022, pleaded guilty in court Wednesday as he accepted a deal.\nThe deal involved Kohberger agreeing to plead guilty in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, waiving all appeals and sparing himself the death penalty.\nKohberger admitted to killing the four students on Nov. 13, 2022. On Wednesday Judge Steven Hippler accepted Kohberger's plea in Boise's Ada County Courthouse\nA formal change of plea hearing is set for 11 a.m. local time Wednesday in Boise's Ada County Courthouse. If the agreement is accepted by the judge, sentencing is expected before the end of July, closing one of Idaho\u2019s most closely watched criminal cases.\nHere's a timeline of the events leading up to Kohberger's plea deal.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER EXPECTED TO OFFICIALLY PLEAD GUILTY: WHAT\u2019S NEXT\nThe night of the killings\n\"Saturday is for the girls,\" read a sign seen hanging through one of the windows at 1122 King Road, an off-campus rental house in Moscow, Idaho, which was home to five University of Idaho students.\nThese included Madison Mogen, a 21-year-old senior majoring in marketing; her best friend Kaylee Goncalves, also 21, who had recently moved out but was visiting for the weekend; Xana Kernodle, a 20-year-old junior majoring in marketing; and two other roommates.\nThough not a roommate, Ethan Chapin, Kernodle\u2019s 20-year-old boyfriend, was staying overnight at the house and was among the four victims. The two surviving roommates were both home at the time but were unharmed during the attack.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER ACCEPTS PLEA DEAL IN IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS CASE\nOn the frigid night of Nov. 12, 2022, roommates Mogen and Goncalves ended an evening at Moscow\u2019s Corner Club and a downtown food truck, while Kernodle and Chapin walked back from the Sigma Chi fraternity house only 200 yards away.\nShortly after 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, police say a lone intruder entered 1122 King Road and fatally stabbed the four students in a blitz that lasted roughly 15 minutes.\nTimeline of Nov. 13, 2022:\n- 4 a.m.: Suspect arrives at house\n- Between 4 and 4:17: Time of murders\n- 4:19: Roommate calls three victims; no one answers\n- 4:22 to 4:24: Surviving roommates text each other from inside the house\n- 4:27: Roommate calls victims again, no one answers\n- 4:32: Roommate texts Goncalves 'Pls answer'\n- 10:23: Surviving roommate texts victims, no one answers\n- 11:39: Roommate calls her father\n- 12 p.m.: 911 call placed from roommate's phone.\nKey moments in the investigation:\nDec. 30, 2022\nThe investigation led authorities to Kohberger, a criminology Ph.D. student at Washington State University. He was arrested in December 2022 in Pennsylvania after forensic evidence linked him to the murders, including DNA found on a knife sheath at the crime scene and cellphone data placing him near the victims' home multiple times.\nJan. 4, 2023\nKohberger was extradited to Idaho on Jan. 4, 2023. He had waived his right to an extradition hearing in Pennsylvania the previous day. He was booked into the Latah County Jail in Moscow, Idaho.\nMay 17, 2023\nOn May 17, 2023, a grand jury in Latah County, Idaho, indicted Kohberger on five felony charges: four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER ALLEGEDLY SEARCHED PICTURES OF FEMALE STUDENTS, SOME WERE CLOSE TO ALLEGED VICTIMS\nMay 22, 2023\nOn May 22, 2023, Kohberger was arraigned in Latah County on charges including four counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony burglary. During the arraignment, Kohberger chose to \"stand silent,\" meaning he did not enter a plea.\nAs a result, the judge entered not guilty pleas on his behalf.\nJune 26, 2023\nOn June 26, 2023, Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson filed a formal notice of intent to seek the death penalty against Kohberger. This filing occurred within the 60-day window mandated by Idaho law following Kohberger's arraignment on May 22, 2023.\nAugust 2023\nDefendant waives right to a speedy trial, postponing proceedings. Kohberger's attorney, Anne Taylor, cited the need for additional time to prepare the defense.\nJune 30, 2025\nKohberger accepts a plea deal: guilty pleas in exchange for life without parole and a waiver of appeals.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER SELFIE FROM DAYS BEFORE ARREST SEEN FOR FIRST TIME\nJuly 2, 2025\nKohberger appeared in the Ada County Courthouse to officially plead guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony burglary. He will be sentenced on July 23 at 9 a.m. to four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.\nImmediately following the hearing, the Mogen family issued a heartfelt statement through their attorney, Leander James, on the steps of the courthouse.\n\"We now embark on a new path,\" James said on behalf of the family. \"We turn from tragedy and mourning. We turn from darkness and uncertainty of the legal process to the light of the future. We have closure. We embark on a path of hope and healing. We invite all of those who have mourned with us to join us, and we wish you well.\"\nThe sentiment drew a stark contrast compared to remarks made by Steve Goncalves, the father of Kaylee Goncalves, as he arrived at the courthouse but chose not to attend the hearing.\n\"He's going to own this,\" Steve Goncalves said of Judge Steven Hippler. \"He's gonna inherit what [Bill] Thompson did. And he's the only one that can fix it. He's the one who can make it right. He needs to protect those other surviving victims and make this person say that they had nothing to do with it. He did it solely, he did it all on his own. And nobody else was responsible.\"\nWhen asked by reporters if he felt justice was served, the grieving father went on to slam the court's decision to hand down four life sentences to Kohberger, saying, \"No, of course not. It's daycare.\"\nJuly 23, 2025\nKohberger was sentenced in a Boise courtroom to four consecutive life prison sentences with no possibility of parole, plus another 10 years.\nThe victims' families and friends spent a few hours delivering blistering impact statements and confronting Kohberger about the pain he has caused. When given the chance to speak, the killer replied: \"I respectfully decline.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital's Audrey Conklin contributed to this report."

      "text": "Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger has accepted a plea deal to spare his life in the murders of four University of Idaho students, two sources close to the case told Fox News Digital Monday.\nKohberger's family released a statement Tuesday, asking for privacy following the bombshell plea deal.\n\"In light of recent developments, the Kohbergers are asking members of the media for privacy, respect, and responsible judgment during this time,\" the family said in a statement to NewsNation's Brian Entin. \"We will continue to allow the legal process to unfold with respect to all parties and will not release any comments or take any questions. We ask that you respect our wishes during a difficult time for all those affected.\"\nKohberger, 30, is accused of killing Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, in a 4 a.m. home invasion attack on Nov. 13, 2022. As part of his plea, he will apparently not have to explain himself or answer why he committed the crimes as part of the deal, according to a source close to the case.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER RETURNS TO COURT FOR HEARING ON PILE OF EVIDENCE HE WANTS THROWN OUT BEFORE TRIAL\n\"Those families have been victimized by the very prosecutors who should have had their backs,\" said Ted Williams, a Fox News contributor and a former Washington, D.C. homicide detective who has been following the case since the beginning.\nThe Goncalves expressed their disappointment with what they described as a \"secretive deal\" on Monday and issued another statement Tuesday saying they want Kohberger to confess in court.\n\"We stand strong that it is not over until a plea is accepted. We will not stop fighting for the life that was stolen unjustly,\" the Tuesday statement said. \"If you feel called or moved to try to make a difference, please contact the Ada County Courthouse to express your thoughts or feelings. While we are cognizant that some may have wanted the plea, the prosecution relayed to us it was NOT a majority vote that was the deciding factor in offering this plea.\"\nThe family is further asking the court to \"require a full confession, full accountability, location of the murder weapon, confirmation the defendant acted alone, [and] the true facts of what happened that night.\"\n\"We deserve to know when the beginning of the end was,\" the statement reads, adding that a confession \"should be the minimum price to pay for his own life.\"\nThe family called on supporters to contact Ada County Judge Steven Hippler.\nOn Monday, the family described the death penalty as \"a bargaining tool for the State, and when rarely applied, it\u2019s never enforced due to a highly inefficient appellate process.\"\n\" The notion that someone can plead guilty to a crime and still face years of appellate delays reveals a systemic failure,\" the statement said. \"The Latah County Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s treatment of our family during this process is something I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone.\"\nThe family added that they \"questioned decisions early in the investigation\" and were \"branded as aversaries\" as a result.\n\"So, it was no shock how the Latah County Prosecutor\u2019s Office mishandled the plea deal,\" the statement read. \"They vaguely mentioned a possible plea on Friday, without seeking our input, and presented the plea on Sunday. Latah County should be ashamed of its Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Four wonderful young people lost their lives, yet the victims\u2019 families were treated as opponents from the outset.\"\nThe family said prosecutors never called them directly about a plea on Monday and gave \"families just one day to coordinate and appear at the courthouse for a plea on July 2.\"\n\"Who do they think they are?\" the statement continued. \"After more than two years, this is how it concludes with a secretive deal and a hurried effort to close the case without any input from the victims\u2019 families on the plea\u2019s details. Our family is frustrated right now and that will subside and we will come together as always and deal with the reality that we face moving forward.\"\nGoncalves' parents live more than seven hours away, in Rathdrum. The hearing will be held Wednesday in Boise after Kohberger successfully argued for a change of venue.\nThe family questioned early choices in the investigation, the restrictive gag order, pressure from school officials as frustrating factors in the way they were treated.\nMembers of Kernodle's family also condemned the plea deal. Her aunt, Kim Kernodle, told TMZ that relatives were vehemently opposed to the idea when Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson's office first raised it over the weekend.\nHowever, Chapin's family indicated in a statement that they are \"in support of the plea bargain\" and will be present in Boise on Wednesday.\nAll four had been stabbed multiple times with a large knife. Police recovered a Ka-Bar sheath that they allege had Kohberger's DNA on it near Mogen's body.\nKohberger was studying for a Ph.D. in criminology at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington. That's 10 miles up the road from Moscow, Idaho, where all four victims were undergrads at the University of Idaho.\n\"By taking a plea deal, Bryan Kohberger has insulated himself from a sentence that would require his execution,\" said Edwina Elcox, a Boise defense attorney who said the deal came as a surprise. \"Only a jury can sentence him to death. Regardless, he will likely spend the rest of his life in prison, without the possibility of ever being in society again.\"\nShe said she hopes the process brings peace to the families after the horrifying crime \u2013 and also that the move would spare Kohberger from facing Idaho's newly revived firing squad as the means of execution if he were convicted and sentenced to death.\n\"They will not have to go through the stress of a trial and the virtually guaranteed appeal process, in the event Kohberger was convicted at trial,\" Elcox told Fox News Digital. \"The judge will take his guilty plea and then set a hearing for Kohberger to be sentenced. He can absolutely expect to spend the rest of his life behind bars.\"\nThe plea deal came as a surprise \u2013 prosecutors had not telegraphed the move and fought hard to keep the death penalty on the table in pretrial proceedings.\nKohberger's defense failed repeatedly to have it removed, revealing his autism diagnosis and crying foul over discovery deadlines it claimed that prosecutors missed.\n\"If they don't get the why, this is the most incomprehensible deal of all time,\" Paul Mauro, a retired NYPD inspector who is following the case, said before the latest update that indicates Kohberger will apparently not have to explain his crimes.\nIf Kohberger agreed to truthfully explain what happened, that could be a reason for the deal to have materialized so unexpectedly, he said. Especially with opposition from at least one family, he said.\nWilliams agreed.\n\"These four kids did not deserve to die this way, and as a part of any plea, he should be required to tell when, how and why he committed these offenses,\" he told Fox News Digital before more details of the plea deal emerged. \"I think that should be a part of any plea \u2013 he owes those families, and the public.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe latest development comes hours after a hearing in Pennsylvania to determine whether witnesses there can be compelled to travel to Idaho to testify in a trial that would have started on Aug. 18.\nDr. Katherine Ramsland, a leading criminologist and one of Kohberger\u2019s former professors at DeSales University, acknowledged the chilling undertones of a criminal justice student using his knowledge to plot a crime but said the benefits of such an education are important.\n\"The risk of this must be weighed against the good that comes out of these programs,\" she told Fox News Digital. \" We all know of killers who took crim courses. I teach about them. \"Among those is Dennis Rader, the serial killer known as BTK, whom Kohberger studied.People need to be trained to stop people like him, she said.\"And we study them to do early intervention when possible,\" she added.\nJoseph Giacalone is a former NYPD cold case investigator and a criminal justice professor at Penn State-Lehigh Valley. \"I was never concerned about teaching someone how to be a better criminal,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Nothing beats experienced investigators. You can learn whatever you want from a book, but that doesn't make you an expert.\"He also said the plea deal could bring some comfort to the victims families \u2014 even if they don\u2019t agree with it now.\"He will have a very difficult time in prison, and if the families have any solace, it's in that he will spend the rest of his life in fear and basically solitary confinement just to stay alive,\" he said."

      "text": "A Washington court has unsealed the search warrants for the office and apartment of University of Idaho stabbing suspect Bryan Kohberger, a 28-year-old Washington State University Ph.D. student accused of murdering four undergrads in nearby Moscow, Idaho.\nA search of his office in the school's department of criminal justice and criminology turned up nothing, according to the filings, but police found hair samples, fabric with dark red stains and a single black glove and other evidence at his apartment.\nThe warrants were initially sealed but a Washington judge ordered the release of redacted versions of the documents Wednesday.\nIn the newly unveiled filings, investigators described previously undisclosed evidence they were seeking, including blood, DNA, shoes with diamond-pattern soles and \"data compilations\" of information about the victims and the King Road house where they were killed.\nIDAHO MURDERS SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER ALLEGEDLY SPAMMED ONE VICTIM WITH INSTAGRAM DMS: REPORT\nKohberger is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and another of felony burglary after allegedly sneaking into a six-bedroom house near the University of Idaho, about 10 miles away from his Washington apartment, and ambushing four undergrads around 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022.\nThe highly anticipated warrants contain new details about what investigators found after they arrested the suspect, who had a master's degree in criminal justice from DeSales University.\n\"These murders appear to have been planned, rather than a crime that happened in a moment of conflict.\"\nThe warrants allege that Kohberger pre-planned the ambush and had studied other murders and how to avoid detection as part of his preparations.\n\"These murders appear to have been planned, rather than a crime that happened in a moment of conflict,\" an affidavit seeking the search warrant reads.\nREAD: Search warrant for Bryan Kohberger's Washington apartment (App users go here)\nFrom Kohberger's apartment, police seized a single \"nitrite-type black glove,\" a Walmart receipt and Dickies tag, two receipts from a Marshalls store, the dust container from a Bissell vacuum, eight \"possible hair strands,\" a Fire TV stick, a single \"possible animal hair strand,\" four other \"possible\" hairs and a computer tower.\nBecause the victims' home contained \"a significant amount\" of blood, spatter and castoff, investigators told the court they believed they would find some of that evidence transferred to Kohberger's apartment.\nOnce inside, police found several bedroom items including a dark red spot, two \"cuttings from uncased pillow of reddish/brown stain,\" and mattress covers with multiple stains.\nHe lived in the apartment alone, according to the filings.\n\"I\u2019m sure by now they have the DNA on the human and animal hair and know exactly where they came from,\" said Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"If those hairs came back to any victim or the dog, they hit the jackpot.\"\nHe added that police had done an \"excellent job\" with the investigation and said that at this point, finding the murder weapon may not be necessary for a conviction.\n\"The only defense argument I can see to discredit the evidence is to say that it was transferred there by the police themselves, which of course depends on what substrate it was found on and if those cops were recently at the crime scene,\" he said.\nREAD: Search warrant for Bryan Kohberger's Washington State University Office (App users go here)\nKohberger allegedly ambushed the four victims around 4 a.m., as some of them were sleeping, according to authorities.\nWhen police responded to a 911 call the following morning, they found 20-year-olds Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin dead on the second floor, and 21-year-olds Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen dead on the upper level.\nOfficers found Kernodle and Chapin together in the same second-story room as they approached her bedroom, according to the filings.\nThey located Goncalves' dog, which also survived the attack, in her bedroom. She and Mogen were both found dead together in the other third-floor bedroom, in the same bed, along with a Ka-Bar knife sheath that authorities allege tested positive for male DNA that they later linked to Kohberger.\nTwo other roommates survived. One of them, identified in court documents only as DM, allegedly heard crying from Kernodle's room and a man saying, \"It's OK, I'm going to help you.\" A short while later, police say she saw a masked man with \"bushy eyebrows\" leaving through a sliding door.\nAuthorities previously revealed that Kohberger finished out the semester following the crime, and in the newly unveiled filings, investigators said they believed he planned to return to class again after the winter break.\nPennsylvania police and the FBI arrested Kohberger on Dec. 30 at his parents' house in the Poconos Mountains, the same day their counterparts in Pullman, Washington, executed search warrants on his apartment and in his WSU office in connection with the stabbings, which took place roughly 10 miles away in Moscow, Idaho.\nThe court had previously ordered the warrants sealed for two months, citing the risk of possible threats to law enforcement, the integrity of the investigation and public safety, but left open the possibility that they could be made public earlier.\nOn Tuesday, Whitman County Prosecutor Denis Tracy moved to have them unsealed.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"These warrants were issued and served in Washington State, because a suspect in the crimes resided and worked here during the time of the murders,\" Tracy wrote. \"These warrants and associated applications were sealed, due to the sensitive nature of the investigation at that time. Since then, an extensive probable cause affidavit has been unsealed in Latah County, Idaho, which has alleviated the need for sealing of the Return of Service here in Washington.\"\nFox News' Sarah Rumpf contributed to this report.\nThis is a breaking news story.

      "text": "BOISE, Idaho \u2013 Bryan Kohberger may have pleaded guilty to the University of Idaho student murders in Moscow, Idaho, but he gave no other details after admitting to the crimes. Despite a trove of new information released by authorities after his sentencing, key questions remain unanswered.\nFor no known reason, he entered an off-campus rental house at 1122 King Road around 4 a.m. Nov. 13, 2022, killing four undergrads inside: Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20.\nWith a gag order lifted and a trove of confidential documents compiled by investigators expected to become public, there may still be more questions than answers after investigators revealed this week that the 30-year-old former criminology Ph.D. student wiped his devices and left no clues as to a motive or which of the students he was targeting and why.\n\"[The] problem is he had a few weeks head start on hiding his tracks before he ever ended up on their radar,\" said Joshua Ritter, a Los Angeles defense attorney and Fox News contributor. \"That's a lot of times in the hands of a man with some education on police investigative procedures.\"\nNEWLY RELEASED DOCUMENTS REVEAL IDAHO KILLER'S DISTURBING BEHAVIOR BEFORE CAMPUS MURDERS\nSoil testing also ruled out most of the country from matching a sample found on Kohberger's shovel inside his car when he was arrested at his parent's house in Pennsylvania. It appeared to have come from a riverbed somewhere near Moscow, Idaho, according to police documents made public Wednesday. Detectives, however, were unable to match it to an exact location.\n\"Obvious questions like, 'where is the knife?' and 'what did he do with his clothing?' still remain,\" Ritter said.\nThe murder weapon was never recovered despite extensive search efforts, the case's two lead detectives said at a news briefing Wednesday. They had assistance from the FBI, which tested soil samples to try and narrow down areas to search. But while they recovered a Ka-Bar knife sheath with Kohberger's DNA on it from the crime scene, they never found the matching knife.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER TRANSFERRED TO MAXIMUM SECURITY STATE PRISON\n\"But the biggest questions \u2014 \u2018Why did he target that house? What connection did he have to any of the victims? And what was his motive for the killings?\u2019 \u2014 the prosecution team has no ideas and does not seem all that interested in finding out,\" Ritter said.\nDespite reporting that suggested Kohberger first eyed Mogen or Kernodle at the Greek restaurant in Moscow where they both worked, speculation that he had followed one or more of the victims on social media or that he had been enraged by his inability to attract women, the only concrete tie police revealed between Kohberger and the victims before the slayings were frequent visits to their home.\nThe lead investigators, Idaho State Police Lt. Darren Gilbertson and Moscow Police Cpl. Brett Payne, declined to speculate about who Kohberger may have specifically targeted and that, despite his extensive education in criminal justice and criminology, they have not uncovered a motive for the crime.\nWATCH: BRYAN KOHBERGER SHREDDED BY VICTIMS' FAMILIES DURING EMOTIONAL SENTENCING HEARING\nWhen asked directly during Wednesday\u2019s press conference whether investigators have uncovered a clear motive behind Bryan Kohberger\u2019s brutal murders of four University of Idaho students, the response was immediate: \"We don\u2019t.\"\nThey did, however, reveal that he successfully used third-party software to wipe his devices and thwart their investigation into his digital activity \u2014 at least some of it.\nThey were still able to find records on his phone that showed he tuned into the local police scanner before turning his phone signal off to commit the crimes. They traced him to the victims' house a dozen times before the murders based on phone data and said returned one last time five hours after butchering the victims. They found a selfie on his phone taken shortly after the crime. They used his location and cell data to trace his movements. They ruled out speculation that he posted about the case with a secret Facebook account under the name \"Pappa Rodger.\"\nBRYAN KOHBERGER TRADED DEATH PENALTY FOR LIFE SENTENCE THAT COULD STILL END VIOLENTLY BEHIND BARS\nJudge Steven Hippler, who accepted the plea deal that spared Kohberger from the death penalty without requiring him to explain his actions, called Kohberger a \"faceless coward\" and suggested that people should move past a motive, which may never be known, and forget the killer outright.\n\"In my view, the time has now come to end Mr. Kohberger\u2019s 15 minutes of fame,\" the judge said.\nReferencing a judicial predecessor known for finding at least one positive thing to say about convicts at sentencing, he said Kohberger left him at a loss.\n\"Truth be told, I\u2019m unable to come up with anything redeeming about Mr. Kohberger,\" he said. \"His grotesque acts of evil have buried and hidden anything that might have been good or intrinsically human about him.\"\nLatah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson said part of the reason he offered a deal that didn't require Kohberger to explain himself was because he thought the mass murderer would just lie in an effort to further traumatize the victims' families.\nPolice caught Kohberger after tracking down DNA evidence found on the knife sheath through cutting-edge methodology known as investigative genetic genealogy. Once they had him in custody, they swabbed his cheek for DNA and confirmed the match. Even without the knife, Gilbertson and Payne said they were confident they would have found him eventually.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThey had solid leads tied to the suspect's vehicle, his white 2013 Hyundai Elantra.\nAdditional documents about the case are expected to be made public by various law enforcement agencies in the coming months. They could continue to reveal new details, but it's doubtful they'll explain the core unanswered questions.\nBut maybe Kohberger will some day from behind bars.\nIf he does, it's unlikely he can profit from the story under Idaho law.\nFox News' Lorraine Taylor and Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report."

      "text": "Washington police have released documents describing an unsolved home invasion involving an intruder with a knife and ski mask just a few miles from the Idaho students' murders crime scene.\n\"[The victim] said she was asleep in bed in her room in the basement when she awoke to her bedroom door being opened,\" according to a Washington police report obtained through public records. \"She said she saw a person enter the room and approach her bed. She said the person was wearing a full-face burgundy ski mask and was holding a knife in their right hand.\"\nShe was unable to tell if the intruder was male or female, but they raised the knife, she told a responding officer.\n\"I like kicked the s--- out of their stomach and screamed super loud, and they like flew back into my closet and then ran out my door and up the stairs,\" she told responding officers in bodycam video.\nINSIDE THE HORROR: IDAHO FOUR CRIME SCENE PHOTOS REVEAL BLOODY AFTERMATH OF ATTACK\nWATCH: Woman describes waking up to find armed man in a ski mask in her bedroom miles from Idaho crime scene\nThe officer told her to sit tight in a locked vehicle with her roommates as police swept the house and surrounding neighborhood and confirmed the intruder had fled.\n\"This is not something that happens in Pullman,\" the officer told them all later. \"About 18 years ago, we had some situations like this, but this is very, very unusual for Pullman.\"\nThe following fall, a mass murder with eerily similar details would rock the community.\nThe Pullman Police Department reopened the case days after Bryan Kohberger's arrest for the Idaho students' murders in December 2022 \u2013 more than a year after the incident, but it remains unsolved. It had been reported previously, but following Kohberger's sentencing and the end of the gag order, police files have been released to the public.\nThe suspect was described as between 5-feet, 3-inches and 5-feet, 5-inches tall, wearing a maroon mask. He or she has not been identified, but police suspected a neighbor early on and later looked for ties to Kohberger.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER PLEADED GUILTY TO IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS, BUT THESE KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED\nRead the police report:\nIt happened around 3:30 a.m. on October 2021 in Pullman, Washington. Kohberger moved there to attend Washington State University in pursuit of a Ph.D. in criminology for the fall 2022 semester. The town is on the state border with Moscow, Idaho, and a 10-mile drive from the University of Idaho, where Kohberger killed four students, three of them in their sleep, in a November 2022 home invasion stabbing spree.\nAfter his arrest in the quadruple murder of four University of Idaho students just 10 miles away, police looked for a possible connection to the Pullman case due to the similarities between the two home invasions. The police report indicates they found no evidence linking him to the earlier case, and they ruled him out and dubbed the investigation \"inactive.\"\nThe victim was not attending WSU at the time but had ties to students there. Like two of the four Idaho victims, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Madison Mogen, 21, she worked at a small restaurant in town.\nIDAHO VICTIMS' FAMILIES TO ADDRESS KILLER DIRECTLY AT KOHBERGER SENTENCING\nPolice investigated the neighbor, identified as Jose Anibal Cruz, but while they identified alleged holes in his alibi, they said they did not have probable cause to arrest him.\nEven Cruz's connection to the case is reminiscent of how Kohberger stalked his victims repeatedly before the murders. The victim told police she worried he could see through her bedroom window when he went outside to smoke. He even told police that he rarely spoke with his neighbors \u2013 except when they complained he was smoking too close to their door.\nCruz could not immediately be reached for comment. According to police records, he allegedly broke into another woman's apartment in 2017 and watched her sleep.\nPolice also received another, albeit unconfirmed, report of a man in a burgundy ski mask up to no good. Two days after the Pullman break-in, other residents reported a masked man waving at students through their window.\nAnother similarity between the two home invasions is that police found unlocked doors and windows.\nLISTEN: THE FOX TRUE CRIME PODCAST WITH EMILY COMPAGNO\n\"Without the DNA on the sheath, this would\u2019ve been nearly impossible, and he would\u2019ve probably struck again,\" said Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and criminal justice professor at Penn State Lehigh Valley.\nKohberger, who had a master's degree in criminal justice from DeSales University in Pennsylvania, studied crime scene cleanup extensively and appears to have known how to avoid detection as a result. However, he left a Ka-Bar knife sheath with his DNA on it under Mogen's body.\nIt wasn't until the FBI assisted Idaho police with investigative genetic genealogy techniques that Kohberger's name surfaced in the investigation. The lead investigators said after his sentencing last month that they would have caught him eventually \u2013 explaining how they had a plan to whittle down the list of suspect vehicles until they had their man.\nPullman police asked WSU officials if Kohberger had come to campus for any recruiting events, but they had no record of his presence during that timeframe.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThere's a chance he could've been in town without having documented it with the university, but air travel, toll booth records or cellphone data could be used to conclusively place Kohberger in his home state of Pennsylvania or in Washington at the time of the incident, Giacalone said.\n\"But at this stage of the game, it doesn\u2019t matter,\" he said.\nIdaho Judge Steven Hippler sentenced Kohberger to four consecutive sentences of life in prison without parole \u2013 plus another 10 years. As part of a plea deal that spared him from the potential death penalty, he waived his rights to appeal and to seek a sentence reduction."

      "text": "The Idaho police chief whose department spearheaded the investigation that landed student murderer Bryan Kohberger behind bars for life is revealing new details about the case.\nMoscow Police Chief Anthony Dahlinger told Fox News' Paul Mauro that two traffic stops on Kohberger in Indiana during a cross-country trip with his dad came before his name had been discovered by investigators and were unrelated to the Idaho investigation. Earlier reports that the stops had been requested to gather information on the suspect are \"completely wrong,\" he said.\nKohberger left a Ka-Bar knife sheath at the crime scene on Nov. 13, 2022, which led the task force investigating the case to his identity on Dec. 19. He drove home with his dad days earlier, at risk of flunking out of his Ph.D. program at Washington State University, about 10 miles from the crime scene.\n\"If we had had that information, he would not have been able to leave the area,\" Dahlinger said.\nKohberger was living in a student apartment in Pullman, Washington. The victims were living across the state line at an off-campus rental next to the University of Idaho. Police arrested the killer at his parents' house in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains on Dec. 30.\nWATCH: Connection between Kohberger, murder victims remains unknown\n\"We had lots of different leads, and we tracked down each and every one of them,\" Dahlinger said. \"It was painstaking, and you know until we got to the end of this, I can't remember exactly how many people that we looked at \u2013 but we did hundreds of interviews with so many different people.\"\nThe sheath proved crucial in the case. None of the victims had Kohberger's DNA under their fingernails, likely because the criminology and criminal justice Ph.D. student wore protective gear.\nStill, Dahlinger said detectives were confident they could have found him without the sheath because they had identified a suspect vehicle, although it would have taken longer.\nThere were no signs Kohberger worked with an accomplice, Dahlinger said. Police have had no luck searching for the murder weapon. Police believe he used only one knife to kill all four victims.\n\"We looked at every angle, but we live in North Idaho,\" he said. \"It's a rural area, and a Ka-Bar knife is a relatively small item, so it's endless where that could be.\"\nPolice did find Kohberger with a gun when they arrested him at his parents' house, although he didn't use it in the student murders. He initially spoke with Pennsylvania police, but clammed up and demanded a lawyer when he realized there were Idaho detectives present, Dahlinger said.\nDahlinger also revealed it was the defense that asked for the plea deal.\nWATCH: Idaho police chief details Kohberger's 'abnormal behavior' after college murders\n\"I was in the room when Bill Thompson gave us that information that they had reached out, the defense had reached out asking if they would be willing to entertain that idea,\" he said, referring to the lead prosecutor on the case. \"And it was very quick.\"\nHe said it caught investigators by surprise, but they were all attuned to how the criminal justice system works.\nBRYAN KOHBERGER PLEADED GUILTY TO IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS, BUT THESE KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED\n\"Just to dispel the whole plea thing as well, because I know every time somebody hears 'plea deal,' right, the whole word 'deal' makes everybody feel like they're getting off. The suspect's getting off somehow. They're not getting their full extent,\" he said. \"Now, the only thing that went off the table on this was the death penalty.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe death penalty was never a lock. Jurors would have had to approve it unanimously after convicting him at trial.\nUnder the deal, Kohberger will die in prison. And he waived his rights to appeal and to seek a sentence reduction.\nIdaho Judge Steven Hippler sentenced Kohberger to four consecutive terms of life in prison, plus another 10 years, for the four counts of first-degree murder and a single felony burglary charge he faced.\nWatch more of the interview streaming on FOX Nation."
