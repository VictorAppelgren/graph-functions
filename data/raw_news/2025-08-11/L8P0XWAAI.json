  "description": "Each member has their own unique traditions before hitting the stage.",
  "content": "Backstreet Boys may have been a band for over 30 years, but each member has their own unique routine before hitting the stage.\n\nNick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson became what would later be known as the best-selling boy band of all time in 1993 but their debut single \u201cWe\u2019ve Got It Goin\u2019 On\u201d and hit ballad \u201cI\u2019ll Never Break Your Heart\u201d put them on the map in 1995 and 1996, respectively.\n\nThose two singles, along with several of their chart-topping smashes, are woven into the Backstreet Boys\u2019 highly talked-about \u201cInto The Millennium\u201d residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas.\n\nWhile the boys are all older, ranging from 45 to 53, some of their backstage habits remain the same, according to their longtime choreographers and creative directors, Rich and Tone Talauega (better known simply as Rich + Tone), who spilled each member\u2019s pre-show ritual in an exclusive interview with The Post.\n\nAdmitting that the vibe before the show is \u201cvery relaxed,\u201d Rich broke down Nick, Howie, AJ, Brian and Kevin\u2019s individual methods while also sharing the one thing the boys do together before performing to about 20,000 adoring fans at their cutting-edge summer residency.\n\nRich + Tone know best, considering the pair has worked with the Backstreet Boys since 1998, first as dancers before becoming the creative directors and choreographers for several of the group\u2019s tours between 2008 and 2020, and now, the \u201cInto The Millennium\u201d Sin City residency.\n\nKeep scrolling to discover each Backstreet Boys\u2019 unique backstage habits.\n\nNick, 45, \u201cdoes this routine where he stretches, like every performer should. But he does a lot of sports stretches to get his body warmed up,\u201d the renowned pair, who have worked with Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Usher, Chris Brown, and more, told The Post.\n\n\u201cHe likes to sweat a little bit before he starts to get dressed,\u201d Rich added.\n\nRich + Tone say that Kevin, 53, is \u201cmore relaxed\u201d than the other guys backstage.\n\n\u201cHe tries not to do too, too much before the show,\u201d Rich shared, emphasizing again that \u201cKevin is just more relaxed\u201d when they come into his room to check in and give him \u201cextra little pep talks,\u201d as they do with his other bandmates, before their performance.\n\nWhen asked if AJ, 47, has any funny pre-show quirks, Rich laughed.\n\n\u201cHe likes to talk a lot,\u201d he responded while noting that AJ \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to think\u201d about their performance before hitting the stage.\n\n\u201cHe likes to have conversations with people about everything else except the show,\u201d the famed choreographer quipped.\n\nHowie, 51, is the most thorough, according to Rich.\n\n\u201cHe does his vocal warm-ups. He likes to warm up his vocals before he starts stretching a little bit,\u201d he revealed about the singer.\n\nHe also enjoys going over notes to learn what he can do better.\n\n\u201cWe like to give him notes about his performance,\u201d Rich said, sharing that the feedback could be about anything from staging to hitting his marks.\n\n\u201cHe says, it\u2019s like his food. Cause it keeps his mind spinning. Because he likes to be sharp,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cAnd no other way to be sharp is to give him notes. And on the smallest things, too, as well, \u2018Where should I look? Should I look onstage left or should I look straight to the right?'\u201d Rich added, saying his biggest note for Howie is \u201c\u2018just be you. Just be free.'\u201d\n\nRich shared that Brian, 50, is like Nick.\n\n\u201cHe likes to warm up. He\u2019s like an athlete. I like to say, I like to treat them all like athletes,\u201d Rich noted.\n\nTo do that, Rich + Tone ensure that \u201cthey\u2019re always doing stretching, whether it\u2019s vocal warm-ups or going over notes.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the five band members, Rich stated Brian is \u201cmore like Nick,\u201d sharing that they warm up similarly before a show.\n\nWhile Nick, Kevin, AJ, Howie and Brian have individual routines, they also take a moment together backstage before kicking off each residency concert.\n\nRich said the \u201cone thing that I love to see them do\u201d is their prayer prior to coming out on the stage, revealing that all five of the boys take turns leading the message.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great because it brings the morale together,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to Rich, they all hug afterward, and both he and Tone remind them they aren\u2019t just Backstreet Boys; they are \u201cicon boys.\u201d\n\nHow long will the Backstreet Boys\u2019 residency run?\n\nThe Backstreet Boys\u2019 summer residency in Sin City kicked off on July 11.\n\nWith larger-than-life visuals \u2014 like giant dancing robots projected on the 160,000-square-foot interior screen and a futuristic platform levitating each member of the group about 80 feet in the air \u2014 and a 1,600 speaker sound system, Rich confessed that the team faced some \u201cchallenges\u201d to make the residency come to life.\n\nThe Backstreet Boys are the first pop group at the Sphere, which opened near the Vegas strip on September 29, 2023.\n\nDue to their overwhelming popularity, they added three additional shows to their lineup.\n\nThe residency is scheduled to end later this month, with the final show set for August 24.\n\nWhile many fans have hope that the Backstreet Boys will extend their residency dates, no official announcement has been made.",

      "text": "Backstreet Boys\u2019 Vegas Sphere residency \u2018challenges\u2019 revealed \u2014 and what left them \u2018in a mad dash\u2019 on opening night\nBackstreet\u2019s Back alright!\nBackstreet Boys Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson delighted fans when they announced \u201cInto the Millennium,\u201d their summer residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas, which started on July 11.\nNow, their longtime choreographers and creative directors, Rich and Tone Talauega (better known simply as Rich + Tone), are spilling all about the ups and downs of putting on the spectacular one-of-a-kind show \u2014 and what left the team \u201cin a mad dash\u201d up until the debut.\n\u201cI mean, it was a long road to get there,\u201d Rich exclusively confessed to The Post following the group\u2019s opening weekend in Sin City. \u201cWe started developing this at the end of last year, going into the new year.\u201d\nThe renowned choreography duo has worked with every major artist from Michael Jackson and Jennifer Lopez to Madonna and Usher.\nRich + Tone have collaborated with the Backstreet Boys for decades, first as dancers for the group at the 1998 Billboard Music Awards before becoming creative directors and choreographers for several of their tours between 2008 and 2020, and finally, their Sphere residency.\nThey explained that this \u201camazing\u201d experience was unlike any other.\n\u201cJust the venue itself was exciting. To know that we were gonna work with the Boys and actually put the first pop boy band in the Sphere for the very first time. So from so many different perspectives and angles, man, it was really, really exciting to see it open,\u201d Rich reflected.\nThe Sphere, which opened near the Vegas strip on Sept. 29, 2023, has held several bands \u2014 but the Backstreet Boys are the first pop group, as noted above, and have quickly sold out the majority of their shows despite the dome-like theater holding up to 20,000 people. Due to the high demand, they even added three additional shows to their August lineup.\n\u201cAnd obviously, us being perfectionists, there were a couple of things, challenges, that were in our way,\u201d Rich shared.\nNoting their residency team, which includes global phenomenon Baz Halpin, whose production company, Silent House, is the show\u2019s design studio, Rich continued, \u201c[We just felt] we had to put everything from experience from 30 years of working in the industry\u201d into the residency.\n\u201cWe had to make sure that we\u2019d come off on top in terms of this incredible venue, but opportunity, too,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd the boys were excited.\u201d\nAll their hard work paid off, especially when Nick, 45, Howie, 51, AJ, 47, Brian, 50, and Kevin, 53, were finally able to perform in front of fans at their sold-out opening weekend concerts.\n\u201cThe energy from the fans was the last missing piece for us,\u201d Rich told The Post. \u201cEverybody was just excited and thrilled to finally break that venue wide open.\u201d\nHe also revealed that the show didn\u2019t fully come together until opening night of the residency \u201ccause the last piece of the puzzle was seeing the actual content in 16K high res, [the] highest resolution.\u201d\n\u201cObviously, the content took the longest to develop and tweak to get it just right for the actual opening. And I can tell you right now, probably, it was 90% done when we were on our first day in the Sphere, and it wasn\u2019t until 100% done until July 11,\u201d Rich admitted.\n\u201cNo one got to see 100% what the visual content was going to look like until the day of the show,\u201d he went on, noting how \u201canxious\u201d they were to see the different aspects of the 90-minute performance \u201cmesh as one for the very first time.\u201d\nThe choreographer said it was his first time working on a project of this magnitude in which everything was still coming together at the eleventh hour.\nBesides the iconic vocals of the best-selling boy band of all time (a record they still hold, per Billboard), there are incredible visuals in the show, including life-size dancing robots projected on the 160,000-square-foot interior screen and a gigantic futuristic platform that levitates each member of the group about 80 feet in the air.\nWhile he noted that the untrained eye might not have noticed, Rich stated there were \u201ca couple of hiccups here and there\u201d during opening weekend with the vocals.\n\u201cI want to say the venue holds 140,000-plus speakers. So that was the first time ever we dealt with that many speakers. We were in a mad dash to get it all mixed, ready and balanced and leveled for the actual show,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the day of the show, there was a couple accents missing.\nRich shared that at times, the bass was \u201ca little too low\u201d and the vocals were \u201cvery high\u201d in terms of music. \u201cAnd so it wasn\u2019t really balanced per se for the venue. So, we almost needed a couple more days,\u201d Rich explained before giving kudos to the music team.\n\u201cThey were working around the clock,\u201d he shared while revealing the team didn\u2019t sleep for the last couple of days leading up to the residency, \u201cbecause there were so many notes coming in from us, from the boys in terms of how it should sound and how the levels were, like, kind of uneven.\u201d\n\u201cThat was probably the most hiccups that we had in any department. But nonetheless, they made it work,\u201d he added, admitting the difference between Show 1 and 2 was \u201cnight and day.\u201d\nWhen asked if anything was scrapped from the Backstreet Boys\u2019 \u201cInto the Millennium\u201d residency, Rich + Tone told The Post the one thing that didn\u2019t make the final cut.\n\u201cI wanted to see the boys do a song that was a cappella from beginning to end in that particular venue,\u201d Rich said while sharing that they\u2019re \u201cvery happy\u201d with the flow of the show.\n\u201cI just feel like there was one song that could have been on there. The whole entire show in a whole \u2018nother stratosphere, but we didn\u2019t end up doing it. It got voted off the list,\u201d he added.\nRich + Tone previously told Billboard that this is \u201cprobably the most ambitious\u201d show that\u2019s been done at Sphere yet, alluding to the pre-shot visuals that are woven into the Backstreet Boys\u2019 live action performance.\n\u201cIf I was a ticket-buying fan, I would want to buy three tickets to see it from three different places,\u201d Rich said, describing the show as \u201c50% a movie experience, 50% a concert experience, and the blend of those two elements is key.\u201d\nThe theme of the concert pays homage to the band\u2019s Millennium era, which was the name of their third studio album released in 1999.\nTone told the outlet that the show\u2019s visuals offer \u201ca historical sort of layout of the Boys\u2019 entire career,\u201d blending \u201csomething new\u201d with \u201csomething nostalgic and familiar.\u201d\nCalling it \u201cvery, very fresh, very modern,\u201d Rich added, \u201cWorking with these guys, we\u2019re reminded they\u2019re icons. Tone and I always love to bring that iconic energy to them and remind them that they are who they are.\u201d\nThe Backstreet Boys broke records with their Grammy-nominated \u201cMillennium\u201d album, landing at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart just over one month after its release and selling 1,134,000 copies in the first week, according to Guinness World Records.\nAt the time, their accomplishment shattered Nielsen\u2019s SoundScan record for first-week sales, which was previously held by country superstar Garth Brooks.\nThe album has reportedly sold 40 million copies worldwide, making \u201cMillennium\u201d one of the best-selling records of all time, and with their summer residency, its sales have soared to nearly 12,000%, Forbes reported on July 26.\n\u201cMillennium\u201d also earned the boys five Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year.\nFor those who haven\u2019t gotten their tickets to the Backstreet Boys\u2019 Vegas residency, there\u2019s still time, but dates are limited.\nThe last show is slated for August 24, marking a total of 21 performances over seven weeks."

It got voted off the list,\u201d he added.\nRich + Tone previously told Billboard that this is \u201cprobably the most ambitious\u201d show that\u2019s been done at Sphere yet, alluding to the pre-shot visuals that are woven into the Backstreet Boys\u2019 live action performance.\n\u201cIf I was a ticket-buying fan, I would want to buy three tickets to see it from three different places,\u201d Rich said, describing the show as \u201c50% a movie experience, 50% a concert experience, and the blend of those two elements is key.\u201d\nThe theme of the concert pays homage to the band\u2019s Millennium era, which was the name of their third studio album released in 1999.\nTone told the outlet that the show\u2019s visuals offer \u201ca historical sort of layout of the Boys\u2019 entire career,\u201d blending \u201csomething new\u201d with \u201csomething nostalgic and familiar.\u201d\nCalling it \u201cvery, very fresh, very modern,\u201d Rich added, \u201cWorking with these guys, we\u2019re reminded they\u2019re icons. Tone and I always love to bring that iconic energy to them and remind them that they are who they are.\u201d\nThe Backstreet Boys broke records with their Grammy-nominated \u201cMillennium\u201d album, landing at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart just over one month after its release and selling 1,134,000 copies in the first week, according to Guinness World Records.\nAt the time, their accomplishment shattered Nielsen\u2019s SoundScan record for first-week sales, which was previously held by country superstar Garth Brooks.\nThe album has reportedly sold 40 million copies worldwide, making \u201cMillennium\u201d one of the best-selling records of all time, and with their summer residency, its sales have soared to nearly 12,000%, Forbes reported on July 26.\n\u201cMillennium\u201d also earned the boys five Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year.\nFor those who haven\u2019t gotten their tickets to the Backstreet Boys\u2019 Vegas residency, there\u2019s still time, but dates are limited.\nThe last show is slated for August 24, marking a total of 21 performances over seven weeks."

      "text": "Rapper Maluma stops concert to scold mom for \u2018irresponsible\u2019 act with her baby\nRapper Maluma abruptly stopped his Mexico City concert over the weekend to call out a mother who had brought her baby without any ear protection into the 26,000-strong crowd.\nThe Colombian musician, 31, was in the middle of a song when he noticed the tot in the audience \u2014 prompting him to scold the child\u2019s mother over the \u201cirresponsible\u201d act.\nIn a now-viral video of the moment, the \u201cFarandulera\u201d singer asked for the baby\u2019s age before putting the mom on the spot.\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a good idea to bring a 1-year-old baby to a concert where the decibels are this f\u2013king high?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat baby doesn\u2019t even know what it\u2019s doing here.\u201d\n\u201cNext time, protect their ears or something,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor real. It\u2019s heavy. It\u2019s your responsibility.\u201d\nMaluma, who has a 1-year-old daughter, Paris, doubled down by saying he would never do that as a father.\n\u201cYou\u2019re waving them around like they\u2019re a toy,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat baby doesn\u2019t want to be there, for real. I\u2019m telling you with all love and respect, now that I\u2019m a father\u2026 would never bring them to a concert. For the next time, be a bit more aware.\u201d\nWhile the crowd cheered in support of Maluma\u2019s remarks, some critics rushed to social media to slam the singer for making the ordeal a public spectacle.\n\u201cEvery mother knows what she has to do with her child. If not, they should limit the capacity to a certain age. What\u2019s the point in putting her through that in front of so many people?\u201d one person wrote on TikTok.\nAnother added, \u201cWas it necessary to embarrass her while he was receiving applause?\u201d\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re right about what you\u2019re saying, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to shame a parent in front of thousands of people,\u201d a third wrote.\nHowever, other fans applauded the singer, whose real name is Juan Luis Londo\u00f1o Arias, for voicing his concerns mid-show.\n\u201cWho would even think of taking a baby? If you have a baby and no one to leave it with, then you don\u2019t go. I totally agree with him,\u201d one fan wrote.\nAnother added, \u201cMaluma is right, it\u2019s not a place for a baby. The organizers and security are the ones really responsible. They shouldn\u2019t have let a baby in.\u201d\nThe singer is currently on his \u201c+Pretty +Dirty World Tour,\u201d which continues on across Latin America, the US and Europe.\nMaluma became a dad in March 2024 after welcoming a daughter with his girlfriend, Susana G\u00f3mez.\nSpeaking to Allure about fatherhood, the \u201cBorr\u00f3 Cassette\u201d hitmaker admitted that \u201ceverything changed\u201d once he became a dad.\n\u201cI love it. Now, I wake up every day with the desire to conquer the world. I know I have to f\u2013king kill it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor Paris, nothing is impossible. You have to lead by example. I go to bed every night that I can at 9 and wake up at 5:30 to hit the gym because I want to be healthy. You want to live forever for your kids. I want to make her proud.\u201d"
