  "content": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 A legal battle is playing out in Mexico over a well-known immigration activist and lawyer who was arrested earlier this month for alleged human trafficking and then ordered released by a judge in a case that underscored the conflicted stands on protecting migrants among Mexican officials.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office announced it will appeal the decision from the previous day to release Luis Garc\u00eda Villagr\u00e1n, who has helped organize migrant caravans that travel north from southern Mexico.\n\nWhen Garc\u00eda Villagr\u00e1n was released from detention on Monday, Judge Jonathan Izquierdo in Tapachula, a city in the state of Chiapas on Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, said authorities did not have enough evidence to prosecute him for human trafficking.\n\n\u201cI had never seen anything like it,\u201d Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero said during the president\u2019s news briefing Tuesday. The judge ignored a multitude of presented evidence and claiming that because \u201dhe was dedicated to protecting migrant groups, he was releasing\u201d the suspect.\n\nGertz Manero added that his office would appeal but did not elaborate.\n\nAfter his release, Garc\u00eda Villagr\u00e1n told reporters the \u201cjudge ordered my release because he said that we do not belong to organized crime\u201d but rather to the activist group Centro de Dignificaci\u00f3n Humana AC, dedicated to protecting the rights of migrants and recognized by the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nThe activist-lawyer, who often accompanies migrant caravans, claimed that his arrest amounted to persecution by Mexican federal authorities for his activism.\n\nSuch caravans have been criticized by authorities, and are regularly blocked by law enforcement, but have been used as a mechanism for migrants to travel safely through an area that has largely been considered the most dangerous stretch of the journey to the United States.\n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum and her predecessor President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador have both emphasized the need to protect migrants, but under pressure from the United States have deployed immigration agents and the National Guard to try to keep migrants from reaching the U.S. border. There have long been accusations that smugglers take advantage of the caravans to move people north.\n\nWhen he was arrested last week, Garc\u00eda Villagr\u00e1n was helping organize a new caravan of up to 300 people that was to leave Tapachula. The march began its walk toward central Mexico and has so far advanced only a few miles (kilometers).\n\nAuthorities say Garc\u00eda Villagr\u00e1n had been wanted for years and that his arrest followed a series of investigations that identified a network of human traffickers using various migrant support organizations as a \u201cfront\u201d for \u201chuman trafficking and drug distribution\u201d in Mexico.\n\nGarc\u00eda Villagr\u00e1n was identified as the \u201cperson in charge of obtaining false documentation\u201d for the passage of migrants through Mexico, in addition to operating as \u201cone of the main promoters of migrant caravans\u201d and having an outstanding arrest warrant.\n\nHis arrest even drew comments from Sheinbaum who said during her daily news briefing on Wednesday that he was \u201cnot an activist\u201d but was tied to trafficking people - and \u201cthat is the crime.\u201d",
