  "description": "Rumors on social media Friday saying government stimulus checks would be distributed soon are false.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump's name is printed on a stimulus check issued in 2020 by the IRS to help combat the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. Read more\n\nRumors spread online Friday that the U.S. government will soon be issuing stimulus checks to taxpayers in certain income brackets.\n\nBut Congress has not passed legislation to authorize such payments, and, according to the IRS, no new stimulus checks will be distributed in the coming weeks.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the facts.\n\nCLAIM: The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department have approved $1,390 stimulus checks that will be distributed to low- and middle-income taxpayers by the end of the summer.\n\nTHE FACTS: This is false. Taxpayers will not receive new stimulus checks of any amount this summer, an IRS official said. Stimulus checks, also known as economic impact payments, are authorized by Congress through legislation and distributed by the Treasury Department. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri last month introduced a bill that would send tax rebates to qualified taxpayers using revenue from tariffs instituted by President Donald Trump. Hawley\u2019s bill has not passed the Senate or the House.\n\nThe IRS announced early this year that it would distribute about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim on their 2021 tax returns a Recovery Rebate Credit \u2014 a refundable credit for individuals who did not receive one or more COVID-19 stimulus checks. The maximum amount was $1,400 per individual.\n\nThose who hadn\u2019t already filed their 2021 tax return would have needed to file it by April 15 to claim the credit. The IRS official said there is no new credit that taxpayers can claim.\n\nPast stimulus checks have been authorized through legislation passed by Congress. For example, payments during the coronavirus pandemic were made by possible by three bills: the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act; the COVID-related Tax Relief Act; and the American Rescue Plan Act.\n\nIn 2008, stimulus checks were authorized in response to the Great Recession through the Economic Stimulus Act.\n\nThe Treasury Department, which includes the Internal Revenue Service, distributed stimulus payments during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Great Recession. The Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, formed in 2012, played a role as well during the former crisis.\n\nHawley in July introduced the American Worker Rebate Act, which would share tariff revenue with qualified Americans through tax rebates. The proposed rebates would amount to at minimum $600 per individual, with additional payments for qualifying children. Rebates could increase if tariff revenue is higher than expected. Taxpayers with an adjusted annual gross income above a certain amount \u2014 $75,000 for those filing individually \u2014 would receive a reduced rebate.\n\n\u201cLike President Trump proposed, my legislation would allow hardworking Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump\u2019s tariffs are returning to this country,\u201d Hawley said in a news release.\n\nNeither the Senate nor the House had passed the American Worker Rebate Act as of Friday. It was read twice by the Senate on July 28, the day it was introduced, and referred to the Committee on Finance.",

      "text": "The Treasury Department, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rapidly sent out three rounds of direct relief payments during the COVID-19 crisis, and payments from the third round continue to be disbursed to Americans.\nStarting in March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided Economic Impact Payments of up to $1,200 per adult for eligible individuals and $500 per qualifying child under age 17. The payments were reduced for individuals with adjusted gross income (AGI) greater than $75,000 ($150,000 for married couples filing a joint return). For a family of four, these Economic Impact Payments provided up to $3,400 of direct financial relief.\nThe COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, enacted in late December 2020, authorized additional payments of up to $600 per adult for eligible individuals and up to $600 for each qualifying child under age 17. The AGI thresholds at which the payments began to be reduced were identical to those under the CARES Act.\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American Rescue Plan), enacted in early March 2021, provided Economic Impact Payments of up to $1,400 for eligible individuals or $2,800 for married couples filing jointly, plus $1,400 for each qualifying dependent, including adult dependents.\n- For this third round of Economic Impact Payments, the American Rescue Plan requires an additional \u201cplus-up\u201d payment, which is based on information (such as a recently filed 2020 tax return) that the IRS receives after making the initial payment to the eligible individual.\n- In addition, the American Rescue Plan increases direct financial relief to American families by providing $1,400 payments for all qualifying dependents of a family, rather than just qualifying children under age 17.\nNormally, a taxpayer will qualify for the full amount of Economic Impact Payment if they have AGI of up to $75,000 for singles and married persons filing a separate return, up to $112,500 for heads of household, and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns and surviving spouses. Payment amounts are reduced for eligible individuals with AGI above those levels.\nThe Treasury Department and the IRS continue to expand outreach to millions of homeless, rural poor, and other disadvantaged Americans to ensure that they receive Economic Impact Payments. This includes new and continued relationships with homeless shelters, legal aid clinics, and providing Economic Impact Payment information in more than 35 languages.\nCheck the Status of Your Economic Impact Payment\n- To check the status of your Economic Impact Payment, please visit the IRS Get my Payment page\n- To check if you qualify for the Economic Impact Payment this round,\n- Were you eligible to receive an Economic Impact Payment in 2020, but never received it?

      "text": "Haven\u2019t filed your 2021 tax return? You might be missing out on a COVID stimulus check\nIf you haven\u2019t filed your 2021 tax returns you might be missing out on a COVID stimulus payment. Taxpayers who haven\u2019t filed 2021 tax returns who may be eligible for the Recovery Rebate Credit must file it by April 15, 2025 to claim the credit.\nEarlier this year, the IRS announced that it\u2019s distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who didn\u2019t receive their COVID stimulus payments. The agency said it\u2019s distributing these payments to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who did not receive one or more Economic Impact Payments (EIP), also known as stimulus payments.\n\u201cLooking at our internal data, we realized that one million taxpayers overlooked claiming this complex credit when they were actually eligible,\u201d IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\nWho is eligible to receive a check?\nThe special payments announced by the IRS are being sent to those taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return but left the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit blank or they filled it out as $0 when they were actually eligible for the credit.\nHow much money will eligible taxpayers receive?\nPayments will vary but the maximum amount will be $1,400 per individual. In total, the IRS will be distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns.\nThe IRS has posted information online about eligibility and how the payment was calculated.\nWhy is the IRS sending out stimulus checks?\nThe Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who didn\u2019t receive the Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus payments, during 2020 and 2021. A refundable tax credit is a credit you can get as a refund even if you don\u2019t owe any tax.\nThe IRS announced this initiative after reviewing its internal data and finding that many eligible taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return didn\u2019t claim the credit.\n\u201cTo minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, we\u2019re making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it,\u201d said Werfel.\nIf I qualify for a stimulus payment, how will I receive it?\nIf you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you don\u2019t have to take any action. The IRS plans sent letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments went out automatically and should\u2019ve arrived by direct deposit or check by late January. They\u2019ll are being sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer\u2019s 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.\nWhat if I haven\u2019t filed my 2021 tax return yet?\nYou still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to the IRS.\nHow many rounds of COVID stimulus payments were there?\nThere were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents.\nIn March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In March 2021, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 per income tax filer and $1,400 per child under the American Rescue Plan Act.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.
