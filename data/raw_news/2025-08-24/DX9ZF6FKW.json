  "title": "Crystal Palace have a week to prove they can match Oliver Glasner\u2019s ambition",
  "description": "The Austrian's lack of options was exposed in Sunday's 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest - he needs proper backing",
  "content": "Change has arrived at Crystal Palace. For the first time in over a decade, they have none of Wilfried Zaha, Michael Olise or Eberechi Eze to call upon. All of a sudden, there is no maverick creative attacking outlet on whom they can rely.\n\nBefore Sunday, since the last of that trio was signed in July 2021, Palace had played 11 games in which none of them featured. In those, they recorded just two wins, with four draws and five defeats. After the 1-1 home draw with Nottingham Forest, it is two victories in 12.\n\nThe difference now is that they are all going to be permanently absent.\n\nThe departures of Olise and Eze over the past year have raised almost \u00a3120million in transfer fees but, while the money is useful, finding adequate replacements for that type of star attacking player \u2014 the ones who can find space in the tightest of situations, dart past opponents with a mesmerising piece of skill, or score from anywhere with an exceptional finish \u2014 is not easy.\n\nWithout Eze against the low block of Norwegian visitors Fredrikstad in the first leg of a UEFA Conference League qualifying play-off on Thursday night, Palace struggled to break down their opposition as they dug out a 1-0 win. They created chances against Forest yesterday but, as time wore on and bodies began to tire, the only creative attacking substitute that manager Oliver Glasner could turn to was Romain Esse \u2014 who turned 20 earlier this summer, has one career Premier League start to his name and who he has conceded is not yet ready to play regularly at this level.\n\n\u201cBefore I arrived, if I asked you: \u2018Who are the most important players in Crystal Palace\u2019s attack?\u2019 (the answer would be) Eze and Olise,\u201d Glasner had said in his pre-match media session. \u201cBoth are gone, and you (Palace) need to replace them.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do the right things now, then I\u2019m worrying that it can go very quickly in the wrong direction in the Premier League. If I see what\u2019s happening around us, (it is) even more (worrying).\u201d\n\nIt all leaves Palace with just over a week, with the summer transfer window shutting next Monday evening, to give Glasner the tools he needs.\n\nPalace\u2019s general partners David Blitzer and Woody Johnson, the latter the club\u2019s new addition at executive level, joined chairman Steve Parish in the Selhurst Park directors\u2019 box yesterday. The matter of how much money will be committed to making signings in the coming days had to have been high on the agenda in their discussions.\n\nAdditions are clearly necessary. Glasner typically favours direct, diligent players over freer creative spirits, but he knows the balance is not there without a player such as Eze around. It is why his frustration at Palace\u2019s relative lack of activity in the transfer market threatened to boil over after the game on Thursday, although he was more measured in his public pronouncements the next day and on Sunday.\n\nMatt Hobbs, the club\u2019s new sporting director, will soon arrive. Identifying talent has not been such an issue this summer, given much of the work was done before his predecessor Dougie Freedman left the club in March, and Parish has acknowledged that he has sought Freedman\u2019s views on possible incomings. But there is still plenty of work to be done, and Hobbs should play a crucial role in that.\n\nIt is quite a contrast to Forest\u2019s situation. When Palace tired in the second half yesterday, their opponents took advantage. Whereas Palace have just lost one of their best players in Eze, Forest not only kept hold of their most important one in Morgan Gibbs-White but could summon well over \u00a3100million of new signings from their bench as they sought a result in south London.\n\nAmong them was striker Igor Jesus \u2014 signed from Botafogo, part of Palace\u2019s former general partner John Textor\u2019s Eagle Football multi-club group \u2014 who rattled a late effort against the crossbar. Omari Hutchinson, another recent arrival, wasted a good chance in stoppage time. Forest were the stronger side in the second half, at least in part due to those they could bring on after trailing 1-0 at the break.\n\nThe home side had two goalkeepers and two academy players among their replacements, as well as the inexperienced Esse. Glasner says he wants to prioritise quality over quantity \u2014 although Palace require both \u2014 and this final week of the window could be the club\u2019s last chance to make a compelling case for the 50-year-old Austrian to sign a new contract, with his current one expiring at the end of this season.\n\nDemonstrate that they can meet his ambition and bring in talent as well as sufficient numbers and there will be hope of convincing their most successful manager to continue; fail to do so, and that task becomes much harder.\n\nPalace posted an image of Zaha, Olise and Eze on their social media channels on Friday with the caption, \u2018Don\u2019t cry because it\u2019s over, smile because it happened\u2019. If Glasner is next in line to leave, that advice may be difficult to take.\n\nIt has been a long time since Palace have been presented with the dilemma of a successful manager who, despite being restricted by the lack of players at his disposal, is still bringing out the best with what he does have in his squad. But successful coaches also tend to be demanding ones, and if Palace hope to fend off the advances that will surely come for Glasner, a proven winner at multiple clubs, then they will need to deliver for him.\n\nAt least he was sounding more upbeat on Sunday evening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we will get the right (replacement) done,\u201d Glasner said after the Forest game. \u201cBecause we have already found the right one.\u201d\n\nThe next few days will be significant in determining how the new era at Selhurst is viewed and how successful it can become.",

      "text": "Few have left such an indelible mark on Crystal Palace as Eberechi Eze.\nIn years to come, the memory will endure of his trademark gliding runs beyond opposition defenders, an FA Cup-winning goal or, maybe above all else, that wonderfully infectious smile of his. Eze has departed for Arsenal, the club he supported in his youth and who released him at 13, but for whom his affection has never waned.\nAdvertisement\nThey are taking back a player offered his first real chance in senior football by Queens Park Rangers, but who developed significantly over five special years in south London. He became a star while at Selhurst Park, a Premier League game-changer and senior England international. And he was loved by all who came across him.\nThe fee for the 27-year-old, an initial \u00a360million ($81.1m) with a further \u00a37.5m of potential add-ons, should allow the club to kick on again. Eze was the poster boy for Palace\u2019s rejigged recruitment strategy, targeting young talent with potential from the Championship and offering regular game-time at the higher level with a pathway onwards. Eze arrived for \u00a316m. The club aimed to sell on at a significant profit.\nHis is the kind of success story then sporting director Dougie Freedman and chairman Steve Parish had targeted. The plan has come together.\nEze in full flight, with confidence, the love of the fanbase and his manager urging him on, is a spectacular watch. His mazy dribbles, the drop of the shoulder and his unique talent for escapology have illuminated so many Palace matches.\nThat appreciation came from afar at first, with Eze signed at the height of the pandemic. He took the step up to the top flight during Project Restart, but behind closed doors. The chance to see him live and in the flesh sustained the fanbase during that horrible time. The player himself delivered to food banks in Lewisham every week of that first season at the club. It was easy to love him on and off the pitch.\nIt took him no time to buy into the club\u2019s community spirit. He has since launched his own charitable foundation in an attempt to revisit his roots and give back to the community which he believes gave him that early support he needed to bounce back from those rejections by Arsenal, Fulham, Millwall, Sunderland and Reading.\nOn the pitch, the player nurtured by QPR after those years in the wilderness found his feet quickly enough at Palace.\nHis unique talent helped give greater purpose and meaning to those sterile, soulless games. There was a mesmerising run from inside his own half beyond Sheffield United defenders, and then the most casual of finishes placed into the bottom corner from the edge of the box to seal a 2-0 win in January 2021. There have been many more special moments in the intervening years with crowds, restored to stadia, marvelling at his natural ability.\nAdvertisement\nWhile it has not always been plain sailing and there have been periods of frustration, the mutual affection never waned.\nThe club rallied round after he ruptured an Achilles tendon in May 2021 \u2014 cruelly on the day he was named in England\u2019s provisional Euro 2020 squad. That call-up had demonstrated the early impact he had made. The road back was hard and not without its bumps, and it was over two years before he made that senior debut for the national team, earning the first of 12 caps while a Palace player. That might have been a target after missing out in 2021, but it has always really been about enjoyment for Eze.\nView this post on Instagram\n\u201cIt feels like fun: running past players, playing passes, assisting and scoring,\u201d he told The Athletic in 2023. \u201cI just enjoy playing football and it\u2019s like I\u2019m at peace. That\u2019s all it is for me. I guess that\u2019s what allows me to do it.\n\u201cIt is a fun place. I\u2019m not thinking of anything; I\u2019m just there doing it. There are not many other places where I feel like that.\u201d\nFor a while, Palace boasted a squad blessed with their irrepressible homegrown star Wilfried Zaha, the prodigiously talented Michael Olise and Eze. The bromance he enjoyed with Olise, who departed a year ago for Bayern Munich, endeared him to the supporters even more despite occasional indifferent form. He always stepped up in the most important moments, when it mattered most. The FA Cup run proved that: Fulham, Aston Villa and Manchester City bear the scars of his brilliance.\nIt felt like goodbye on the Premier League opening weekend as Palace played out a goalless draw with Chelsea on Sunday. But his was an understated farewell, even if he lingered in front of the travelling support in the Shed End longer than he would normally.\nIt is unfortunate Palace supporters did not have the opportunity to say goodbye properly at Thursday night\u2019s Conference League play-off against Fredrikstad, and that Eze\u2019s first experience of UEFA competition will not now come at Selhurst Park as a reward for an outstanding five years\u2019 work. He was at the ground, but not on the pitch.\nYet the warmth which emanates from within the club and the fanbase for him will remain.\nHe departs having helped transform the team. Few will resent him for his opportunity now to thrive elsewhere and take the next step in his career.\n\u201cI feel like if I\u2019m given that licence, then I\u2019m able to be free and create and that\u2019s when I can make things happen,\u201d he said in that 2023 interview.\nWhile that was not always something afforded him at Palace, whether due to injury or ill-suited systems, he did always thrive when offered a stage. He made things happen. He made defenders look amateurish. He helped bring fans to their feet.\nAdvertisement\nThose were his gifts. Now he is being rewarded in kind with a move to the club he loves more than any other.\nOne special moment at Wembley marked the high point. He took Palace to their first-ever major trophy. He helped make history. That will never be forgotten.\nEze\u2019s greatest Palace moments\nPalace 1-0 Manchester City, FA Cup final (May 17, 2025)\nThe ultimate contribution in the most important game Palace have ever played. Appropriate, given his outstanding run of form, dragging Palace out of a rut in the early stages of the quarter-final tie against Fulham with an outstanding individual goal, and scoring the opener with a thumping strike against Aston Villa in the semi-final.\nBut also because it was the culmination of everything for player and club: hard work, resilience and an attitude dedicated to never giving up in the face of adversity. This was his sixth goal in six games.\nEze on form, feeling free and loved, made a beeline for the middle of the penalty area in anticipation that Daniel Munoz would reach the ball first and cut it back to him. That is what happened and, with one swing of his boot, Eze had scored the goal which won the FA Cup for Palace.\nPalace 3-0 Aston Villa, FA Cup semi-final (April 26, 2025)\nWith only a little backlift, Eze produced a moment of magic. Ismaila Sarr\u2019s pass found him on the edge of the box, and he took a second and thrashed a shot past Emi Martinez in the blink of an eye. Eze stood there, knowing, believing, reminding everyone what he can do. It was the opening goal of the game and set Palace on their way at Wembley.\nPalace 2-0 Sheffield United, Premier League (January 2, 2021)\nThe moment Eze properly introduced himself, even if it was behind closed doors. Although he beat only two Sheffield United players directly, it was the way he carried the ball so effortlessly, with such purpose and belief, only then to finish the move with such a casual swing of his boot without breaking stride. A wonderful moment.\nAdvertisement\nPalace 5-2 West Ham United, Premier League (April 21, 2024)\nAnother example of his versatility and talent. Jean-Philippe Mateta\u2019s shot was saved by Lukasz Fabianski only to bounce up into Eze\u2019s path. He adjusted his body and thumped in a bicycle kick for the second of five Palace goals.\n(Top photo: Eddie Keogh \u2013 The FA/The FA via Getty Images)"

      "text": "The English FA will investigate a banner displayed by Crystal Palace fans showing Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis holding a gun to the head of midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White.\nThe banner was displayed in the Lower Holmesdale Stand, where the Holmesdale Fanatics supporters\u2019 group sits, at Selhurst Park during Sunday\u2019s Premier League game between the sides. It was not shown during Sky Sports\u2019 UK broadcast of the match.\nAdvertisement\nOn the banner, Gibbs-White is shown with a speech bubble next to him reading: \u201cMr Marinakis is not involved in blackmail, match-fixing, drug trafficking or corruption!\u201d\nMarinakis has always strongly denied any wrongdoing in relation to these allegations.\nAs well as Gibbs-White, the banner also depicts Marinakis holding a briefcase overflowing with cash; what appears to be a UEFA delegate standing behind bags which read \u201ccorrespondence\u201d with the UEFA and Forest badges on; former Palace minority shareholder John Textor as a clown; and a ship with Marinakis\u2019 name on \u2014 the Greek businessman is the founder and chairman of Capital Maritime & Trading Corp.\nOn the Palace website, in a statement which ends with \u201cPublished by The Football Association Premier League Limited\u201d, the club say, \u201cBanners must not contain foul language, be defamatory or contain political or offensive slogans and the club reserves the right to turn banners away if the content is felt to be offensive in any way.\u201d\nWhen contacted by The Athletic, the Premier League indicated the incident was a matter for the FA. Palace and Forest were approached for comment. The Holmesdale Fanatics declined to comment.\nAhead of the game, Palace said on social media that they \u201cwould like to remind supporters that acts of discrimination, including inappropriate chanting, violence and entering the field of play, will not be tolerated at Selhurst Park\u201d.\nGibbs-White signed a new contract at Forest in late July, having been the subject of bids from Tottenham Hotspur and appearing set to have a medical at the north London club. The Athletic reported that Gibbs-White had a key 30-minute meeting with Marinakis before committing his future to Forest until 2028.\nTensions between Palace and Forest have grown over the summer after the former was demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League \u2014 with the latter promoted as a result \u2014 having been found to have breached UEFA\u2019s multi-club ownership rules. UEFA\u2019s decision to demote Palace was upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) earlier this month.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2021, a banner displayed at Selhurst Park by the Holmesdale Fanatics was the subject of a police investigation. That banner was on display when Newcastle United faced Palace, shortly after the north-east club\u2019s takeover, which was largely funded by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF). The banner took aim at the Premier League\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test, and the Croydon Metropolitan Police said it had been reported as \u201coffensive\u201d.\nExplaining the Palace-Forest tensions\nIn the aftermath of Palace\u2019s demotion, their chairman Steve Parish did a round of media interviews in which he intimated that someone else had been behind the punishment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re led to believe that\u2019s the issue,\u201d said on The Rest Is Football podcast, when asked by host Gary Lineker if Forest had \u201cplayed a part\u201d in the process. \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t someone who wanted to get in as a consequence, then there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\nThis was in reference to a letter that Forest had written to UEFA about the issue, which they have always insisted was a matter of them simply seeking clarity about which competition they would be in this season, so they could plan accordingly. Forest also say the letter was sent when UEFA was already investigating Palace\u2019s status amid a crackdown on these rules, which had already seen European football\u2019s governing body kick Irish side Drogheda United and Slovakia\u2019s DAC 1904 out of the Conference League for similar breaches.\nNevertheless, Forest\u2019s owner Marinakis, along with former Palace minority shareholder John Textor \u2014 whose controlling stake in French side Lyon had been the trigger for Palace\u2019s demotion \u2014 and UEFA, became the focus of Palace fans\u2019 ire.\nAt their first three games of this season \u2014 the Community Shield at Wembley, the goalless Premier League draw away to Chelsea and the first leg at home against Fredrikstad \u2014 Palace fans displayed a banner with the words \u2018UEFA MAFIA\u2019 on a version of the body\u2019s logo with a Euro symbol replacing the map of Europe, and also chanted \u201cF*** UEFA, f*** John Textor, f*** Marinakis.\u201d It\u2019s clear who they blame for the situation, and it\u2019s not anybody in the current Palace hierarchy.\n(Top photo: Richard Pelham/Getty Images)"

With the transfer window closing next Monday, the club\u2019s new sporting director Matt Hobbs and board members are under pressure to secure replacements and demonstrate financial commitment, while Glasner warns that failure to do so could jeopardise his position. The club\u2019s recent transfer strategy\u2014selling young talent for profit\u2014has been highlighted by Eze\u2019s move to Arsenal, and fan unrest has manifested in controversial banners and chants. Overall, Palace must act quickly to rebuild their attack and maintain stability amid mounting expectations from owners, supporters and the Premier League.",
