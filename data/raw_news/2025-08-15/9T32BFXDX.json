  "title": "New Air Force policy denies transgender troops hearings before they're discharged",
  "description": "The Air Force says in a new memo that transgender airmen ousted under a recent Trump administration directive will no longer have the chance to argue before a board of their peers for the right to continue serving their country",
  "content": "It is the second policy change the Air Force has taken in recent weeks to crack down on transgender service members. The Associated Press reported last week that the Air Force would deny transgender troops early retirement benefits and was moving to revoke requests already approved.\n\nThe Air Force declined to answer questions about the policy and its legal implications.\n\nThe service provided a statement saying the new guidance \u201cis consistent with and responsive to Department of Defense policy regarding Service members with a diagnosis of, or history of, or exhibiting symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria.\u201d\n\nHow the boards usually work\n\nThe boards traditionally offer a quasi-legal hearing to determine if a service member set to depart is still of value to the military and should stay on. Fellow service members hear evidence of whatever wrongdoing occurred and about the person's character, fitness and performance.\n\nThe hearings are not a formal court, but they have much the same structure. Service members are often represented by lawyers, they can present evidence in their defense and they can appeal the board\u2019s findings to federal court.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s policy on separating officers notes that they are entitled to \u201cfair and impartial\u201d hearings that should be \u201ca forum for the officer concerned to present reasons the contemplated action should not be taken.\u201d\n\nThis impartial nature means that the boards can sometimes reach surprising conclusions.\n\nFor example, the three active-duty Marines who were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were retained.\n\nThe commanding officer of the USS McCain, a destroyer that collided with an oil tanker in the Pacific in 2017, killing 10, was not recommended for separation in 2019.\n\nPriya Rashid, a military lawyer who has represented service members before hundreds of separation boards, said she \u201chas never seen an order like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people with three DUIs retained, I\u2019ve seen people that beat their wives retained, I\u2019ve seen all kinds of people retained because the board is empowered to retain anyone for any reason if they feel it's in the best interest of the service,\u201d she said.\n\nRashid said she and other lawyers working with transgender troops view the guidance as telling the boards to automatically order separation based solely on a diagnosis or symptoms of gender dysphoria.\n\nShe said that constitutes an unlawful command by the Air Force and upends impartiality.\n\n\u201cThis instruction is essentially saying you will not make a determination of whether somebody has future potential in the service,\u201d Rashid said.\n\nThe new Air Force guidance also prohibits recording the proceedings.\n\nRashid said the lack of an independent transcript would not only prevent Air Force leaders from reviewing the hearings to ensure they were conducted appropriately but would undercut any meaningful chance to appeal.\n\nPentagon officials say 4,240 troops have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which the military is using as an identifier of being transgender.\n\nThe Pentagon got the green light from Supreme Court in May to move forward with a ban on all transgender troops. It offered two options: volunteer to leave and take a one-time separation payout or be discharged at a later date without pay.\n\nSome transgender troops decided to fight to stay by turning to the boards.\n\nSenior Master Sgt. Jamie Hash, who has served in the Air Force since 2011, said she \u201cwanted to face an objective board to be evaluated on my years of proven capability.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted the board to see the assignments overseas and at the Pentagon, the deployments to different Combatant Commands, the service medals and the sustained operational and mission effectiveness,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nBut now, she said, that \u201cthe path ahead feels more uncertain than it ever has.\u201d\n\nLogan Ireland, a master sergeant in the Air Force with 15 years of service that includes a deployment to Afghanistan, was planning to retire early until his request was denied last week.\n\nAfter that, he decided he would take a stand at the separation board.\n\n\u201cI chose the involuntary route because I believed in the promise of a fair hearing \u2014 judged on my service, my record and the facts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow that promise is being ripped away, replaced with a process designed to decide my fate before I even walk in the room,\u201d he said, adding that \u201call I\u2019m asking for is the same fairness and justice every service member deserves.\u201d\n\nBoth Ireland and Hash said they have yet to hear from their immediate superiors on what the new policy will mean for them.\n\nLawyers are worried it will set a precedent that will spread throughout the military.\n\nRashid said both the Army and Navy are \u201cgoing to look at what the Air Force is doing as a standard of law \u2026 is this the minimum standard of law that we will afford our service members.\u201d\n\nTransgender troops warn the policy could have wider implications\n\nCol. Bree Fram, a transgender officer in the Space Force who has long been seen as a leader among transgender troops, argued that the policy is a threat to other service members.\n\nIn an online post, Fram said it \u201cswaps judgment for automation.\u201d\n\n\u201dToday it\u2019s gender dysphoria; tomorrow it can be any condition or class the politics of the moment calls for,\u201d she argued.\n\nIf the new policy is allowed to sideline \u201cevidence of fitness, deployment history, awards, and commander input \u2014 the very material boards were built to evaluate,\u201d Fram said, it sends a message that performance is no longer relevant to staying in the military.\n\nCathy Marcello, interim director for Modern Military Association of America, said the change adds to a \u201cgrowing loss of trust\u201d because outcomes are determined by politics, not performance. The organization advocates for LGBTQ+ service members, military spouses, veterans, their families and allies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a signal that identity, not ability or achievement, determines who stays in uniform and who gets a fair shot,\u201d she said.",

      "text": "US Air Force to deny retirement pay to transgender service members being separated from the service\nUS Air Force to deny retirement pay to transgender service members being separated from the service\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Air Force said Thursday it would deny all transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without retirement benefits. One Air Force sergeant said he was \u201cbetrayed and devastated\u201d by the move.\nThe move means that transgender service members will now be faced with the choice of either taking a lump-sum separation payment offered to junior troops or be removed from the service.\nAn Air Force spokesperson told The Associated Press that \u201calthough service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved.\u201d About a dozen service members had been \u201cprematurely notified\u201d that they would be able to retire before that decision was reversed, according to the spokesperson who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal Air Force policy.\nA memo issued Monday announcing the new policy, which was reviewed by the AP, said that the choice to deny retirement benefits was made \u201cafter careful consideration of the individual applications.\u201d\nAll transgender members of the Air Force are being separated from the service under the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\nSeparation process has hit some bumps\nThe move comes after the Pentagon was given permission in early May by the Supreme Court to move forward with a ban on all transgender troops serving in the military. Days later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a policy that would offer currently openly serving transgender troops the option to either volunteer to leave and take a large, one-time separation payout or be involuntarily separated at later date.\nA Pentagon official told reporters in May that they viewed the policy as treating \u201canyone impacted by it with dignity and respect.\u201d\nHowever, in late July, transgender troops told Military.com that they were finding the entire separation process, which has included reverting their service records back to their birth gender, \u201cdehumanizing\u201d or \u201copen cruelty.\u201d\nShannon Leary, a lawyer who represents LGBTQ+ people in employment discrimination cases, says she expects lawsuits to challenge Thursday\u2019s decision. \u201cIt seems quite arbitrary on its face and cruel,\u201d she said. \u201cThese military members have dedicated their lives to serving our country.\u201d\nNormally, Leary said, when early retirement is offered in the military, it\u2019s available to all members who have served over 15 years. She said she expects other service branches to follow the Air Force\u2019s path.\nOne Air Force service member says he\u2019s \u2018devastated\u2019\nLogan Ireland, a master sergeant in the U.S. Air Force who has 15 years of service, including a deployment to Afghanistan, is one of the airmen impacted by the policy. \u201cI feel betrayed and devastated by the news,\u201d he said.\nIreland said he was told that his retirement was being denied on Wednesday when his chain of command, \u201cwith tears in their eyes,\u201d told him the news.\nOfficials have said that as of Dec. 9, 2024, there were 4,240 troops diagnosed with \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d on active duty, National Guard and Reserve. Pentagon officials have decided to use the condition and its diagnosis as the main way to identify troops who are trans.\nHowever, the two are not an exact match \u2014 not every transgender person has the condition. As a result, there is an understanding that the actual number of transgender people within the military\u2019s roughly 2 million troops may be higher.\nUnder the latest policy, active duty troops had until June 6 to voluntarily identify themselves and receive a payout while troops in the National Guard and Reserve had until July 7. Pentagon officials previously told reporters that they plan to lean on commanders and existing annual medical screenings to find any transgender service members who do not come forward.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill contributed reporting."

      "text": "Supreme Court allows Trump ban on transgender members of the military to take effect, for now\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to enforce a ban on transgender people in the military, while legal challenges proceed.\nThe court acted in the dispute over a policy that presumptively disqualifies transgender people from military service and could lead to the expulsion of experienced, decorated officers.\nThe court\u2019s three liberal justices said they would have kept the policy on hold. Neither the justices in the majority or dissent explained their votes, which is not uncommon in emergency appeals.\nJust after beginning his second term in January, Trump moved aggressively to roll back the rights of transgender people. Among the Republican president\u2019s actions was an executive order that claims the sexual identity of transgender service members \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life\u201d and is harmful to military readiness.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the Supreme Court has acted to allow a transgender military service ban, for the time being.\nIn response, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy in February that gave the military services 30 days to figure out how they would seek out and identify transgender service members to remove them from the force. Those actions had been stalled by the lawsuits.\n\u201cNo More Trans @ DoD,\u201d Hegseth wrote in a post on X following Tuesday\u2019s Supreme Court order. Earlier in the day, before the court acted, Hegseth said that his department is leaving wokeness and weakness behind. \u201cNo more pronouns,\u201d he told a special operations forces conference in Tampa. \u201cNo more dudes in dresses. We\u2019re done with that s\u2014-.\u201d\nThe Defense Department said Tuesday that officials are currently determining the next steps, but officials were not aware of any actions being taken right away.\nThree federal judges had ruled against the ban.\nIn the case the justices acted on Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Benjamin Settle in Tacoma, Washington, had ruled for seven long-serving transgender military members who say that the ban is insulting and discriminatory and that their firing would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations. A prospective service member also sued.\nThe individual service members who challenged the ban together have amassed more than 70 medals in 115 years of service, their lawyers wrote. The lead plaintiff is Emily Shilling, a Navy commander with nearly 20 years of service, including as a combat pilot who flew 60 missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\nThe Trump administration offered no explanation as to why transgender troops, who have been able to serve openly over the past four years with no evidence of problems, should suddenly be banned, Settle wrote. The judge is an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and is a former captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps.\nSettle imposed a nationwide hold on the policy and a federal appeals court rejected the administration\u2019s emergency plea. The Justice Department then turned to the Supreme Court.\nThe policy also has been blocked by a federal judge in the nation\u2019s capital, but that ruling has been temporarily halted by a federal appeals court, which heard arguments last month. The three-judge panel, which includes two judges appointed by Trump during his first term, appeared to be in favor of the administration\u2019s position.\nIn a more limited ruling, a judge in New Jersey also has barred the Air Force from removing two transgender men, saying they showed their separation would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations that no monetary settlement could repair.\nThe LGBTQ rights groups Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation called the high court order a devastating blow to dedicated and highly qualified service members.\n\u201cBy allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice. Transgender individuals meet the same standards and demonstrate the same values as all who serve. We remain steadfast in our belief that this ban violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and will ultimately be struck down,\u201d the groups said in a statement.\nThe federal appeals court in San Francisco will hear the administration\u2019s appeal in a process that will play out over several months at least. All the while, though, the transgender ban will remain in place under the Supreme Court order.\nIn 2016, during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, a Defense Department policy permitted transgender people to serve openly in the military. During Trump\u2019s first term in the White House, the Republican issued a directive to ban transgender service members, with an exception for some of those who had already started transitioning under more lenient rules that were in effect during Obama\u2019s Democratic administration.\nThe Supreme Court allowed that ban to take effect. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, scrapped it when he took office.\nThe rules the Defense Department wants to enforce contain no exceptions.\nThe policy during Trump\u2019s first term and the new one are \u201cmaterially indistinguishable,\u201d Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the justices, though lawyers for the service members who sued disagreed.\nThousands of transgender people serve in the military, but they represent less than 1% of the 2.1 million troops serving.\nA senior defense official said in February that they believe there are about 4,200 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria currently serving in the active duty, National Guard and Reserves.\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues, said that between 2015 and 2024, the total cost for psychotherapy, gender-affirming hormone therapy, gender-affirming surgery and other treatment for service members is about $52 million.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor contributed to this report."

The policy removes the possibility of impartial board hearings, prohibits recording proceedings, and treats the diagnosis as the sole basis for separation, raising legal concerns about due process. Transgender troops and their advocates argue the change undermines fairness, equates identity with performance, and could set a precedent for other branches. The move follows a Supreme Court decision that allowed a Trump-era ban on transgender service members to take effect while lawsuits continue to challenge the policy.",
