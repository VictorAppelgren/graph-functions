  "content": "In a quiet corner of eastern Kentucky, an abandoned television factory once left for dead is roaring back to life. But it\u2019s not TVs being assembled inside.\n\nAmerican Resources Corporation has transformed the shuttered Thompson Electronics plant into a high-tech manufacturing hub tackling one of the most urgent challenges facing the United States today: rare earth independence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what few people thought could be done \u2014 taking discarded material and converting it into pure, high-value rare earth elements, right here in America,\u201d said CEO Mark Jensen.\n\nLed by his vision, American Resources is leveraging what\u2019s already right here in the US \u2014reclaiming rare earths from industrial waste and end-of-life products\u2014using proprietary technology that separates and purifies these valuable materials.\n\nHis excitement is infectious. The company he leads has a 15-year head start in an industry that barely exists domestically. American Resources Corporation is a pioneer in extracting and refining rare earth elements\u2014like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium\u2014from recycled materials. These elements power everything from smartphones to electric vehicles and missile systems.\n\nThe company is rewriting conventional wisdom: that the U.S. doesn\u2019t manufacture anything anymore, that Americans are completely reliant on foreign imports\u2014especially from China. And it's not doing it by ripping up landscapes which is what routinely happens in mining rare earths overseas and which is widely considered to be an environmentally dirty business. It's using what\u2019s already here, utilizing existing raw materials to power our future both cleanly and efficiently.\n\nAt the heart of this innovation is the company\u2019s ReElement process, now operating at commercial scale. It produces both c-grade and magnet-grade rare earths from recycled feedstock at the Kentucky facility.\n\nSo quietly has this process been developed that many\u2014including potential partners\u2014didn\u2019t even know it existed. That changed when major players from DC to Silicon Valley started to take notice, largely due to current tensions with China which exports 80% of the United States\u2019 rare earth minerals. The concept of producing high-purity rare earths in America, outside of foreign influence, has been a front and center priority of both the current administration and across party lines in Congress.\n\nThe company\u2019s momentum is unfolding in tandem with broader shifts in global trade. With new tariffs imposed by the federal government that have increased costs on imported rare earths and other critical materials, US companies have had to rethink their sourcing. The renewed focus on domestic manufacturing has most major US technology companies reassessing where and how they produce these key elements.\n\nWith the infrastructure and technology in place, the company seems well positioned to meet demand. The Kentucky facility, rebuilt from the ground up, serves as both a working prototype and a symbol of possibility. The materials it produces may soon power fighter jets, satellites, electric vehicles, and next-gen technologies.\n\nFor many Americans, the idea of turning industrial waste into defense-grade materials sounds far-fetched. Jensen believes that the idea that we have to go overseas for these materials is false. \u201cThe United States has all the raw ingredients it needs\u2014and we\u2019re proving that every day. We\u2019re not dependent. We\u2019re underdeveloped,\u201d states Jensen. And that\u2019s the distinction. And also the opportunity.",
