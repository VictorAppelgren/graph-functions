  "description": "",
  "content": "SOLANA BEACH, Calif., Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evoke Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVOK), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases with an emphasis on GIMOTI\u00ae (metoclopramide) nasal spray, today announced that U.S. Patent No. 12,377,064 covering the use of GIMOTI\u00ae (metoclopramide) nasal spray in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of gastroparesis, has been listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the \u201cOrange Book\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe the listed patent shows our commitment to developing innovative products that expand options for patients and providers, while also protecting our hard work and investment in innovation,\u201d said Matt D\u2019Onofrio, Chief Executive Officer of Evoke Pharma.\n\nThe newly listed patent has an expected expiration date of November 17, 2038, which is approximately eight years past our prior last to expire Orange Book listed patent of May 15, 2030. The newly listed patent reinforces Evoke\u2019s long-term strategy to maximize GIMOTI\u2019s commercial life and support continued access for patients requiring a non-oral and effective treatment for diabetic gastroparesis, while protecting Evoke\u2019s investment in innovation.\n\nEvoke is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat GI disorders and diseases. The company developed, commercialized and markets GIMOTI, a nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide, for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults.\n\nDiabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents resulting in serious GI symptoms as well as other systemic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications. Prior to FDA approval to commercially market GIMOTI, metoclopramide was only available in oral and injectable formulations and remains the only drug currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis.\n\nGIMOTI is indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis. Important Safety Information:\n\u2022 Metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. The risk of developing TD increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dosage.\n\u2022 Discontinue GIMOTI in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. In some patients, symptoms may lessen or resolve after metoclopramide is stopped.\n\u2022 Avoid treatment with metoclopramide (all dosage forms and routes of administration) for longer than 12 weeks because of the increased risk of developing TD with longer-term use.\n\n\n\nGIMOTI is not recommended for use in:\n\u2022 Pediatric patients due to the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and other extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the risk of methemoglobinemia in neonates.\n\u2022 Moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute), and patients concurrently using strong CYP2D6 inhibitors due to the risk of increased drug exposure and adverse reactions.\n\u2022 In patients with a history of tardive dyskinesia (TD) or a dystonic reaction to metoclopramide.\n\u2022 When stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous (e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage mechanical obstruction, or perforation).\n\u2022 In patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas. Metoclopramide may cause a hypertensive/pheochromocytoma crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor.\n\u2022 In patients with epilepsy. Metoclopramide may increase the frequency and severity of seizures.\n\u2022 In patients with hypersensitivity to metoclopramide. Reactions have included laryngeal and glossal angioedema and bronchospasm.\n\n\n\nPotential adverse reactions associated with metoclopramide include: Tardive dyskinesia (TD), other extrapyramidal effects (EPS), parkinsonism symptoms, motor restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), depression, suicidal ideation and suicide, hypertension, fluid retention, hyperprolactinemia, effects on the ability to drive and operate machinery. Most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) for GIMOTI are: dysgeusia, headache, and fatigue. These are not all of the possible side effects of GIMOTI. Call your doctor for medical advice about whether you should take GIMOTI and the possible risk factors and side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.\n\nEvoke cautions you that statements included in this press release that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201ccontemplates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201ccontinue\u201d or the negatives of these terms or other similar expressions.

This passion, as well as our focused concentration on developing treatments for patients living with gastrointestinal diseases, is a key driver for our success. Established and led by specialty pharmaceutical executives with extensive experience in the US market, Evoke Pharma is committed to improving the lives of patients with gastrointestinal diseases.\nAddressing unmet needs for gastrointestinal diseases\nWe recognize the significant unmet medical needs in the gastrointestinal space, particularly in diabetic gastroparesis. Characterized by slow or delayed gastric emptying, diabetic gastroparesis is a debilitating, chronic condition with significant impact on patients who suffer from symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, bloating, early satiety, and vomiting. Many patients do not achieve adequate relief of their diabetic gastroparesis symptoms due to erratic absorption of orally administered drugs. Over a decade ago, we discovered this significant gap in treatment that represented an urgent need for a new approach to therapy. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to change the way patients manage their diabetic gastroparesis symptoms since oral metoclopramide was approved in 1979.\nOur commitment\nEvoke Pharma is committed to ensuring that patients and healthcare professionals have access to our medication as well as the information, tools, and support they need during treatment."

This study is the first to explore GIMOTI as a supportive care option for DGP patients taking GLP-1's. Data highlights: \u2705 89% reduction in all-cause ER visits \u2705 66% reduction in office visits \u2705 Top 5% of data awarded the Presidential Poster Award \ud83c\udfc6 \u2705 Outstanding Research Award in the Stomach Category\ud83c\udfc6 Matt D'Onofrio, CEO of Evoke Pharma commented, \"This data is particularly encouraging given the rising number of patients using GLP-1 agonists for diabetes, many of whom also suffer from gastroparesis. \"Our goal is to provide data regarding Gimoti as supportive care for diabetic gastroparesis for those also on GLP-1 agonists. This study, combined with the earlier real-world data presented at key conferences, reinforces GIMOTI's potential to improve outcomes for patients and reduce the overall financial burden on the healthcare system.\" Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients globally, in which the stomach takes longer than usual to empty its contents, resulting in severe GI symptoms and systemic complications. GIMOTI is the first and only FDA-approved nasal spray treatment for acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults. It has been approved in the US since 2020.

It\u2019s not just nausea. It\u2019s feeling full after three bites. It\u2019s canceling plans, navigating hospital visits, and trying to explain an invisible illness. According to the International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD), gastroparesis symptoms can be severe enough to cause dehydration, malnutrition, and frequent ER visits. Yet many patients still go undiagnosed or misunderstood. At Evoke Pharma, we\u2019re not only raising awareness\u2014we\u2019re advocating for earlier diagnosis, real empathy, and accessible treatment options like GIMOTI.

According to the International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD), Gastroparesis is estimated to affect up to five million people in the United States, and yet many experiencing the symptoms remain undiagnosed. At Evoke Pharma, we\u2019re focused on the daily realities of people living with diabetic gastroparesis, a chronic, disruptive GI disorder that causes delayed stomach emptying and debilitating symptoms like nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and abdominal pain. These symptoms often lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and frequent ER visits. For many of these patients, especially those who struggle to eat or keep food down, oral medications may be difficult to take, tolerate, or absorb. That\u2019s why having effective therapies delivered through alternative routes is so important. GIMOTI was developed to meet this need. As the first and only FDA-approved nasal spray for acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults, it offers a convenient and effective treatment option when oral delivery may not be practical or reliable. This August, let\u2019s raise awareness, elevate patient needs, and push for better outcomes. \ud83d\udce2 Share. Tag.
