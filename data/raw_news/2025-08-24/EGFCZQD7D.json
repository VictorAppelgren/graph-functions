  "description": "The strikes come just days after Houthi rebels fired a missile toward Israel, which the military said was the first cluster bomb launched by the rebels since 2023.",
  "content": "CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen\u2019s capital on Sunday, just days after the Houthi rebels fired a missile toward Israel that its military described as the first cluster bomb the rebels had fired at it since 2023.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis said the strikes hit multiple areas across Sanaa. The Houthi-run health ministry said that at least two people were killed and 35 others were wounded.\n\nSanaa residents told The Associated Press they heard loud explosions close to a closed military academy and the presidential palace. They said they could see plumes of smoke near Sabeen Square, a central gathering place in the capital.\n\nThe Houthis have launched missiles and drones toward Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea for over 22 months, saying they are attacking in solidarity with Palestinians amid the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli strikes were the first to hit Yemen since a week ago, when Israel said it targeted energy infrastructure it believed was used by the rebels.\n\nThe latest strikes follow the Houthis\u2019 claim of launching a newly equipped missile toward Israel on Friday, including targeting the country\u2019s largest airport, Ben Gurion. There was no reported damage or injuries. Israel\u2019s military said it fragmented mid-air after several interception attempts.\n\nAn Israeli Air Force official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, called the projectile fired on Friday a new threat. It was a cluster munition, he said, meant to detonate into multiple explosives on impact.\n\nFrom November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones. The rebels stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in Gaza and later became the target of a weekslong airstrike campaign ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nIn May, the United States announced a deal with the Houthis to end the airstrikes in return for an end to shipping attacks, although the rebel group said the agreement did not include halting attacks on targets it believed were aligned with Israel.\n\nFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

      "text": "UK military launches airstrikes with US targeting Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 The British military launched airstrikes with the United States targeting Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, officials said early Wednesday, their first attack in Washington\u2019s new intense campaign targeting the Iran-backed group.\nThe United Kingdom offered a detailed explanation for launching the strike, in a departure from the U.S., which has offered few details about what it says are more than 1,000 targets it has hit since beginning its campaign on March 15.\nThe campaign, called \u201cOperation Rough Rider,\u201d has been targeting the rebels as the Trump administration negotiates with their main benefactor, Iran, over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.\nUK strike hits near Yemen\u2019s capital\nThe U.K. Defense Ministry described the site attacked as \u201ca cluster of buildings, used by the Houthis to manufacture drones of the type used to attack ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, located some 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of Sanaa.\u201d\nRoyal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s took part in the raid, dropping Paveway IV guided bombs, the ministry added.\n\u201cThe strike was conducted after dark, when the likelihood of any civilians being in the area was reduced yet further,\u201d the ministry said.\nThe British offered no information on the damage done in the strike, nor whether they believed anyone had been killed.\nThe U.S. military\u2019s Central Command didn\u2019t acknowledge the strike.\n\u201cThis action was taken in response to a persistent threat from the Houthis to freedom of navigation,\u201d U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said. \u201cA 55% drop in shipping through the Red Sea has already cost billions, fueling regional instability and risking economic security for families in the U.K.\u201d\nThe Houthis reported several strikes around Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, which the group has held since 2014. Other strikes hit around Saada.\nThe British have taken part in airstrikes alongside the U.S. since the Biden administration began its campaign of strikes targeting the Houthis back in January 2024. However, this new strike is the first to see the British involved in the campaign under U.S. President Donald Trump.\nUK strike comes after US allegedly hit prison\nThe joint U.K.-U.S. strike follows an alleged U.S. airstrike on Monday that hit a prison holding African migrants, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others. The U.S. military said it was investigating.\nOn April 18, an American strike on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others in the deadliest known attack of the U.S. campaign.\nThe U.S. is conducting strikes on Yemen from its two aircraft carriers in the region \u2014 the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea and the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea, targeting the Houthis because of the group\u2019s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel.\nThe Houthis are the last militant group in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that is capable of regularly attacking Israel. The rebels began their attacks over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli decision to block the flow of aid to Palestinians.\nThe American strikes have drawn controversy in the United States over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s use of the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about the attacks.\nEarly Thursday, Hegseth directly threatened Iran in a message on the social platform X.\n\u201cMessage to IRAN: We see your LETHAL support to The Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou know very well what the U.S. Military is capable of \u2014 and you were warned. You will pay the CONSEQUENCE at the time and place of our choosing.\u201d"

Their attacks over the past two years have upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1 trillion of goods passes each year.\nIn an announcement late Sunday night, the Houthis said they had \u201cdecided to escalate their military support operations and begin implementing the fourth phase of the naval blockade\u201d against Israel.\nThey warned that they would target \u201call ships belonging to any company that deals with the ports of the Israeli enemy, regardless of the nationality of that company, and in any location within the reach of our armed forces.\u201d The vessels would be targeted regardless of their destination, they added.\nThe group said countries should pressure Israel to stop the war in Gaza and lift its blockade on the Palestinian territory \u201cif they want to avoid this escalation.\u201d\nEarlier this month, the Houthis attacked and sank two Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carriers \u2013 the Magic Seas and the Eternity C. The attack on the latter killed four crew members and 11 others were taken captive. All 22 crew members of the Magic Seas were rescued before the ship sank.\nThe group released a video on Monday evening, showing the 11 captured Eternity C crew members. The footage, the first of its kind since the Houthi attacks started, shows the crew being taken off the boat as well as interviews with the captives.\nFrom November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones. The rebels stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war and later became the target of an intense, weekslong airstrike campaign ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nIn May, the United States announced a deal with the Houthis to end the airstrikes in return for an end to shipping attacks, although the rebel group said the agreement did not include halting attacks on targets it believed were aligned with Israel."

      "text": "UN council authorizes continuing vigilance of attacks by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels on Red Sea shipping\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday authorized continued reporting on attacks on ships in the Red Sea by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who have defied its previous demands to immediately halt all such attacks.\nThe vote in the 15-member council was 12-0 with Russia, China and Algeria abstaining because of attacks against Yemen in violation of its sovereignty, a clear reference to U.S. airstrikes against the Houthis who control most of northern Yemen. The Trump administration has carried out the strikes because of the group\u2019s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on close ally Israel.\nThe resolution, cosponsored by the United States and Greece, extends the requirement that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres provide monthly reports to the Security Council about Houthi attacks in the Red Sea until Jan. 15, 2026.\nActing U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea said the resolution recognizes the need for continued vigilance \u201cagainst the Iran-backed Houthi terrorist threat.\u201d\nShe cited the two latest attacks by Houthis against civilian cargo vessels, the MV Magic Seas and the MV Eternity C, which caused both vessels to sink and led to the loss of innocent seafarers and saw crew members taken hostage.\n\u201cThe United States strongly condemns these unprovoked terrorist attacks, which demonstrate the threat that the Houthis pose to freedom of navigation and to regional economic and maritime security,\u201d Shea said, reiterating the council\u2019s demand for an immediate halt to Houthi attacks and the release of all crew members kidnapped from the Eternity C.\nThe assaults represent the latest chapter of the rebels\u2019 campaign against shipping over the war in Gaza that began with Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 surprise attack in southern Israel. They also come as Yemen\u2019s nearly decadelong war drags on in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, without any sign of stopping.\nGreece\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris said the Houthi attacks have continued to fuel mistrust in the international maritime community, stressing that security and freedom of navigation are essential for the stability of global supply chains and economic development.\n\u201cIf the Red Sea region \u2014 a critical international maritime route \u2014 becomes even more degraded, it will expose the international community to more acute security risks and economic uncertainty,\u201d he warned.\nRussia\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky said Moscow abstained because language in the previous resolution demanding a halt to Houthi attacks was arbitrarily interpreted to justify \u201cthe use of force affecting the territory of the sovereign state of Yemen.\u201d\n\u201cWe stand convinced that any steps aimed at stabilizing the situation in Yemen and around Yemen should be taken in political and diplomatic ways,\u201d he said.\nChina\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Geng Shuang said his country abstained because \u201ccertain countries took military action against Yemen, which seriously impacted the Yemeni peace process and exacerbated tensions in the Red Sea.\u201d\nThe Houthis have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas in Gaza.\nShuang called tensions in the Red Sea \u201ca major manifestation of the spillover from the Gaza conflict.\u201d Russia\u2019s Polyansky also stressed the link between normalizing the situation in the Red Sea and the need for a ceasefire in Gaza and release of all hostages.\nAlgeria\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Toufik Koudri, whose country is the Arab representative on the Security Council, expressed regret the Yemen resolution demanding an immediate halt to Houthi attacks made no mention of the Gaza war, which he called \u201cone of the catalytic factors.\u201d\n\u201cThe Security Council cannot disregard the clear nexus between the attacks in the Red Sea and the aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the deep feelings that resulted from the brutal massacres committed against innocent civilians,\u201d he said."

They just don\u2019t want to fight. And we will honor that, and we will stop the bombings.\u201d\nHis announcement came the same day that Israel\u2019s military launched airstrikes against the Houthis that it said fully disabled the international airport in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Israel\u2019s attacks were its second round of airstrikes on targets in Yemen in retaliation for a Houthi missile strike Sunday on Israel\u2019s international airport.\nA U.S. official said the administration had not notified Israel of the agreement with the Houthis before Trump talked about it publicly.\nIsrael, according to this official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic talks, was irked by the unexpected news \u2014 particularly because the Houthis have continued to launch attacks on Israel proper and other Israeli targets.\nIsrael does not appear to be covered by the U.S.-Houthi agreement.\nAppearing before reporters again later Tuesday, this time for the swearing-in of senior adviser and special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump was asked about the possibility that the Houthis would continue to attack Israel and responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, frankly.\u201d\n\u201cBut I know one thing, they want nothing to do with us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve let that be known through all of their surrogates and very strongly.\u201d\nTrump calls ending airstrikes \u2018positive\u2019\nIn his comments during the earlier meeting with Carney, Trump said the Houthis had \u201ccapitulated but, more importantly, we will take their word that they say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. And that\u2019s what the purpose of what we were doing.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s very positive,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThey were knocking out a lot of ships.\u201d\nAsked how the Houthis had communicated that they were looking to stop being targeted by U.S. bombs, Trump offered few details, saying only with a chuckle that the information came from a \u201cvery good source.\u201d\nOmani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, confirmed that the U.S. bombing campaign was ending, posting on X that discussions involving the U.S. and Oman, as well as negotiators in Yemen, \u201chave resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides.\u201d\n\u201cIn the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,\u201d he wrote, calling the agreement a \u201cwelcome outcome.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Houthis said that its position toward Gaza hadn\u2019t changed and its \u201cinitial understanding\u201d with the U.S. would not impact its support for the Palestinians. It wasn\u2019t clear in the statement whether it was on board with the agreement with the U.S.\nCosts of U.S. operation against the Houthis\nThe costs of the U.S. munitions used against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen in daily attacks since March 15 have totaled more than $750 million, another U.S. official said. The Trump administration has dropped more than 2,000 munitions on more than 1,000 targets, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details on the strikes.\nThe total is only a fraction of the total costs of the operation. It doesn\u2019t account for the costs of operating two aircraft carriers, their accompanying warships or the flight hours of the aircraft.\nIt also doesn\u2019t include the Houthis destroying seven U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones, at a cost of more than $30 million apiece, or the loss of an F/A-18 fighter jet and tug from the carrier USS Harry S. Truman when it maneuvered to avoid a Houthi missile and the jet fell off the carrier.\nDespite Trump\u2019s framing of the deal as a way to reopen the Red Sea to commercial shipping without fear of Houthi attack, \u201cthe Houthis have not fired on a commercial ship since December,\u201d Gregory Brew, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group risk-analysis firm, said on X.\n\u201cThey are likely, however, to continue shooting at Israel,\u201d Brew noted.\n\u201cAs to the Houthis continuing to attack Israel - they do so at Iran\u2019s own peril,\u201d Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on social media.\nHouthi attacks on shipping\nThe Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nFrom November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.\nThe Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March.\nThose strikes Trump had ordered were similar to ones carried out against the Houthis multiple times by the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden.\nThe Trump administration actions gained a higher profile in the public consciousness when The Atlantic revealed that Hegseth had texted sensitive plans for a military strike against the Houthis on a group chat in the messaging app Signal that mistakenly included the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief.\nTrump stood by Hegseth and downplayed the breach as a \u201cglitch.\u201d But national security adviser Mike Waltz, who created the group chat on Signal, left his post last week and has been nominated by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Lee, Tara Copp and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen\u2019s capital Sanaa after the Houthi rebels fired a cluster\u2011bomb\u2011type missile at Israel, killing two and wounding 35. The Houthis have been launching missiles and drones at Israeli and shipping targets in the Red Sea for over 22 months, prompting U.S. and U.K. airstrikes on Houthi facilities. The U.N. Security Council authorized continued monitoring of Houthi attacks on shipping, while President Trump announced a halt to U.S. airstrikes following a reported Houthi pledge to stop attacking ships. Meanwhile, the Houthis warned they would target any merchant vessel linked to Israeli ports, escalating tensions in the region.",
