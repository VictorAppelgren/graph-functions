  "content": "A judge in Chile has agreed to suspend proceedings against a teenage American pilot and social media influencer who has been stuck on a remote Antarctic island since late June after he was accused of landing there without permission.\n\nEthan Guo was attempting to fly to all seven continents solo, raising funds for cancer research, when he landed on a part of Antarctica where the South American country maintains a territorial claim. Prosecutors accused him of providing false information to ground control about his landing point.\n\nOn Monday, a judge approved an agreement between Guo\u2019s lawyers and prosecutors to suspend the proceedings on the condition that he donate $30,000 to a children\u2019s cancer foundation within 30 days. He must also leave the country and will be prohibited from reentering Chilean territory for three years.\n\nChilean prosecutor Cristi\u00e1n Crisoto told reporters on Monday that Guo and his plane were still in Antarctic territory and that he would also have to pay the costs of \u201caircraft security and personal maintenance.\u201d\n\nChilean authorities said that Guo had submitted a false flight plan and took off from Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo Airport in the southern Chilean city of Punta Arenas as the sole passenger and crew member aboard a Cessna 182Q aircraft, registered as N182WT. At one point during that flight, authorities say he turned off course toward Antarctica.\n\nGuo\u2019s lawyer has previously said that the young pilot experienced \u201ccomplications\u201d while flying.\n\n\u201cWhile already in the air, he began to experience a series of complications,\u201d Karina Ulloa said, adding that Guo claims \u201cthat he was conducting an exploratory flight to see if he could follow this route or not.\u201d\n\nGuo, whose website states he was trying to raise $1 million for cancer research by becoming \u201cthe first person ever to fly to all seven continents solo,\u201d had broadcast his continent-hopping journey since last September to more than a million Instagram followers.",

      "text": "A teenage pilot, who is attempting to fly all seven continents solo, hit a patch of rough air this weekend when Chilean authorities detained him for changing his flight plan without their permission and landing in Antarctica.\nChilean prosecutors say American influencer Ethan Guo, 19, broke \u201cmultiple national and international regulations\u201d by changing his flight plans without prior notice, landing on a part of Antarctica where the South American country maintains a territorial claim.\nCNN requested a comment from Guo, whose lawyer on Sunday said the young pilot had experienced \u201ccomplications\u201d while flying.\nGuo, whose website states he is trying to raise $1 million for cancer research by becoming \u201cthe first person ever to fly to all seven continents solo,\u201d has broadcast his continent-hopping journey since last September to more than a million Instagram followers.\nHis last post, on June 23, documents a flight over the Philippines.\nChilean authorities say that on Saturday, Guo submitted a false flight plan and took off from Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo Airport in the southern Chilean city of Punta Arenas as the sole passenger and crew member aboard a Cessna 182Q aircraft, registered as N182WT. At one point during that flight, authorities say he turned off course toward Antarctica.\n\u201cThe accused provided false information to the aeronautical authority. He submitted a flight plan indicating that he was going to fly over the city of Punta Arenas,\u201d said Cristian Crisosto Rifo, the Regional Prosecutor of Magallanes and Chilean Antarctica.\n\u201cHowever, he continued toward Antarctica without informing anyone and without any authorization, landing at the airfield of Lieutenant Rodolfo Marsh Base in Chilean Antarctic territory. With this behavior, the accused seriously endangered the safety of air traffic to Antarctica and the Magallanes region,\u201d the prosecutor added.\nCristoso explained that as soon as Guo landed in Antarctica, he was detained and formally charged. \u201cThe accused not only violated the Aeronautical Code but also multiple national and international regulations regarding routes to Antarctica and access to the white continent,\u201d emphasized Crisosto.\nOn Sunday, his lawyer told reporters at a press conference after Guo was charged that the young pilot experienced \u201ccomplications\u201d while flying. \u201cWhile already in the air, he began to experience a series of complications,\u201d Karina Ulloa said, adding that Guo claims \u201cthat he was conducting an exploratory flight to see if he could follow this route or not.\u201d\nCNN requested a comment from Ulloa on Tuesday.\nThe Magallanes and Chilean Antarctic Prosecutor\u2019s Office determined on Sunday that the teen must remain in the Chilean sector of the frozen continent until authorities give him permission to return to the city of Punta Arenas.\nThe Chilean court decreed a 90-day investigation period for this case, during which time Guo must remain in Chile."
