  "description": "Mr. Scorsese is a new five-part docuseries about legendary director Martin Scorsese, here\u2019s the Apple TV+ release date and first clip.",
  "content": "Apple and Martin Scorsese are becoming frequent collaborators, with the legendary director helming Killers of the Flower Moon and also guest acting in hit comedy The Studio. Scorsese\u2019s next appearance will be in the five-part docuseries Mr. Scorsese, here\u2019s the Apple TV+ release date and first clip.\n\nMartin Scorsese was recently nominated for an Emmy. Not for directing, but rather acting.\n\nHis hilarious guest appearance in The Studio was one of the series\u2019 most impressive cameos.\n\nBut Scorsese will be spending even more time in front of the camera in Apple\u2019s new docuseries: Mr. Scorsese.\n\nMr. Scorsese will release on Apple TV+ on Friday, October 17, per a new press release.\n\nThe five-part series hails from director Rebecca Hall and offers a wide-ranging look at Scorsese\u2019s prolific career in film, and the man himself.\n\nHere\u2019s Apple\u2019s official summary, and a very funny first video clip:\n\n\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a film portrait of a man through the lens of his work, exploring the many facets of a visionary who redefined filmmaking, including his extraordinary career and unique personal history. With exclusive, unrestricted access to Martin Scorsese\u2019s private archives, the documentary series is anchored by extensive conversations with the filmmaker himself and never-before-seen interviews with friends, family and creative collaborators including Robert De Niro, Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Robbie Robertson, Thelma Schoonmaker, Steven Spielberg, Sharon Stone, Jodie Foster, Paul Schrader, Margot Robbie, Cate Blanchett, Jay Cocks and Rodrigo Prieto, along with his children, wife Helen Morris and close childhood friends. From acclaimed director Rebecca Miller, \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d examines how his own colorful life experiences informed his artistic vision as each film he made stunned the world with originality. Starting with his New York University student films and continuing to the present day, this documentary explores the themes that have fascinated Scorsese and informed his work, including the place of good and evil in the fundamental nature of humankind.\n\nThe clip above tells the story of Taxi Driver almost being vetoed by the powers that be due to its extreme violence, and Scorsese\u2019s (joking) threat of violence in return.\n\nAre you interested in watching Mr. Scorsese when it hits Apple TV+? Let us know in the comments.\n\nApple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Morning Show, Silo, and Shrinking.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

The sneak-peek look at the new series grants audiences unprecedented access to the Academy Award-winning filmmaker, Martin Scorsese. As seen in the clip, Scorsese and his filmmaker friends, including Steven Spielberg, reflect on how the director\u2019s cut of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d almost never saw the light of day, and the extreme lengths the visionary filmmaker was willing to go to protect what would go on to be one of his most iconic films.\n\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d examines how Scorsese\u2019s colorful life experiences informed his artistic vision, as each film he made stunned the world with originality. Starting with his earliest experiences (New York University student films) through to the present day, this documentary explores the themes that have fascinated Scorsese, including the place of good and evil in the fundamental nature of humankind.\n\u201cThis project is a filmmaker\u2019s dream, to have had such access to legends of the industry, from Marty himself to his prolific collaborators, close friends and family members,\u201d said award-winning director Rebecca Miller. \u201cI was honored he trusted me to create this documentary, which I believe will resonate with everyone from dedicated Scorsese fans to anyone who has grappled with failure and reached for stars.
