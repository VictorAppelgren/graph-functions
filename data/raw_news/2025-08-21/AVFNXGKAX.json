  "content": "VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 20, 2025 /CNW/ - New Found Gold Corp. (\"New Found Gold\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV: NFG) (NYSE-A: NFGC) is pleased to welcome Tamara Brown to its board of directors (the \"Board\"). Following the Annual General and Special Meeting of the shareholders of New Found Gold (the \"Shareholders\") held in Vancouver, BC, on August 20, 2025 (the \"Meeting\"), the Board now comprises Paul Huet, Keith Boyle, William Hayden, Vijay Mehta, Melissa Render, Chad Williams and Tamara Brown. At the Meeting, disinterested Shareholders voted in favour of an ordinary resolution to approve the creation of Mr. Eric Sprott as a new \"Control Person\" (as defined by the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSXV\")). It is anticipated that Mr. Sprott will become a new Control Person upon closing of the previously announced non-brokered private placement of up to 12,269,939 common shares (the \"Common Shares\") at a price of C$1.63 per Common Share for gross proceeds of approximately C$20 million (the \"Private Placement\"). The Private Placement is anticipated to close by August 27, 2025, subject to final approval of the TSXV and authorization of the NYSE American LLC (the \"NYSE American\"). In addition, resolutions regarding the following matters were passed by the requisite majority at the Meeting:\n\u2022 fixing the number of directors at seven;\n\u2022 appointing KPMG LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, as auditor of the Company at a remuneration to be fixed by the Board;\n\u2022 approving the amendment of \"10% rolling\" stock option plan of the Company; and\n\u2022 approving the \"5% rolling\" share unit plan of the Company. The Meeting did not consider any matters that were not presented in the management information circular, dated July 8, 2025, that was filed in connection with the Meeting. Paul Huet, Chairman of New Found, stated \"On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to welcome Tamara to New Found Gold. With her extensive capital markets experience and depth of knowledge of the mining industry as both a mining executive and a professional engineer, Tamara's addition to the Board continues to strengthen the team and the Company as a whole.\" This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the Common Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that jurisdiction. As a result of a reduction of the Fire Weather Index in the area of the Company's 100% owned Queensway Gold Project (\"Queensway\"), Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, exploration activities involving the use of heavy equipment in or near forested areas, including, drilling, mulching and excavating, have restarted at Queensway. These activities had previously been suspended as a precaution against regional forest fire risks (see the New Found Gold news release dated August 13, 2025).\n\nKeith Boyle, Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"The Fire Weather Index across Newfoundland has been reduced to acceptable levels. With weather conditions favourable and the Fire Weather Index within operational limits, exploration activities will resume immediately. The Company will continue to monitor the situation and implement additional measures to mitigate forest fire risks. The New Found Gold team once again extends its thanks to the firefighters for their hard work in maintaining community safety.\" New Found Gold holds a 100% interest in Queensway, located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, a Tier 1 jurisdiction with excellent infrastructure and a skilled local workforce. The Company has completed an initial mineral resource estimate (\"MRE\") and preliminary economic assessment (\"PEA\") at Queensway (see New Found Gold news release dated March 24, 2025 and July 21, 2025). Recent drilling continues to yield new discoveries along strike and down dip of known gold zones, pointing to the district-scale potential of the 175,450 ha project that covers a 110 km strike extent along two prospective fault zones. New Found Gold has a new management team in place, a solid shareholder base, which includes a 19% holding by Eric Sprott, and is focused on growth and value creation at Queensway.

Missed the highlights from our recent PEA? We\u2019ve got you covered\u2014here are the top 3 questions on our phased mining plan. 1\ufe0f\u20e3What does the mine plan for the Queensway Gold Project look like? - Phase 1 (Years 1-4): Open-pit mine with off-site toll milling - Phase 2 (Years 5-15): Open-pit mine with construction and operation of on-site processing plant and in-pit tailings deposition - Phase 3 (Years 6-10): Underground mine development and operation 2\ufe0f\u20e3Why do we outline a phased approach? A phased project design provides for early gold revenue generation, processing of the highest-grade mineralized material at the start of the operation and in-pit tailings deposition. This unique design enables: \u2705 Low initial capital investment \u2705 Rapid payback of that initial investment \u2705 Using cashflow to grow the operation \u2705 Superior rate of return \u2705 Minimizing dilution to shareholders 3\ufe0f\u20e3How much gold do we expect to produce in each phase? We expect 1.5 million ounces of recoverable gold to be produced over a 15-year mine life, with an average annual gold production of 69.3 koz of gold for phase 1 (Year 1 to Year 4) and 172.2 koz of gold for phase 2 (from Year 5 to Year 9). \ud83d\udcc4Learn more: Check out our PEA releases and presentation on the website: https://lnkd.in/ejCMatV8 #gold #projectlocation #PEAresults #Newfoundland #NFG #NFGC\n-\nA mining conference like no other - I\u2019ve just wrapped up my first Diggers & Dealers Mining Forum, on the edge of the Super Pit in Kalgoorlie, WA. I used to say PDAC in March in Toronto only brought the serious mining crowd, but that does not hold a candle to the trek to Kal in the brisk Australian \u201cwinter\u201d to wine, dine and talk all things #Gold #Mining. Kudos to the organizing team for putting on a fantastic conference. It was my pleasure to reconnect with friends and colleagues from around the globe, make so many new Australian connections and continue to talk about the recent New Found Gold Corp. #PEA.\n-\nThe The Fraser Institute recently released its Annual Survey of Mining Companies for 2024, with 350 participants, representing 2,200 mining companies, evaluating 82 jurisdictions around the world.
