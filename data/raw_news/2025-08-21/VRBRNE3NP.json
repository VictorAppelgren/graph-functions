Innovative Solutions was a launch partner for the AWS SMB Competency in January 2024, and as such, is one of a small subset of AWS partners uniquely positioned to help emerging and growing companies on AWS.\n\nUniquely, Innovative utilized DarcyIQ, an agentic AI consulting platform that accelerates sales, to rapidly reach, inspire, and assist SMBs with growing on the AWS cloud. Using DarcyIQ, Innovative has tripled new customer acquisition in the SMB segment in the last 8 months.\n\n\"Innovative Solutions was born out of the SMB space and our mission is to help every SMB leverage the power of AWS,\" added Justin Copie, CEO of Innovative Solutions. \"Right now, SMB cloud spend is expected to reach $578B over the next two years, and at the same time, the overwhelming majority (91%) of small business technology transactions are facilitated or influenced by a partner. We aim to be the trusted partner that helps small and midsize businesses navigate the AWS ecosystem for their maximum benefit.\"\n\nAs part of its SCA, AWS has co-invested with Innovative Solutions in go-to-market activities in the SMB space as well as initiatives to support SMB customers on AWS. With AWS's support, Innovative has expanded its second headquarters in Boca Raton, FL in support of this strategic collaboration, brought additional products to market, and built new technology that allows growing businesses to buy AWS services instead of having to build from scratch.\n\n\"DarcyIQ helped us build upon Innovative's AWS SMB and Generative AI competencies,\" said Travis Rehl, CTO, Innovative Solutions. \"We are clearly at the forefront of building the products and solutions that will continue to make genAI and genBI initiatives accessible to businesses of all sizes on AWS.\"\n\nInnovative Solutions has specialized expertise in working with companies in manufacturing, retail, financial services, life sciences/healthcare, and leverages DarcyIQ to perform discovery, analyze customer buying intent, and ultimately generate Statements of Work in minutes.
