  "title": "Are Trump\u2019s Tariffs Still In Effect? Here\u2019s What To Know.",
  "description": "Trump challenged the appellate court ruling and claimed the Supreme Court would likely keep his tariffs in place.",
  "content": "An appellate court ruled most tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal, backing a lower court\u2019s argument that the levies exceeded Trump\u2019s authority, though the duties will remain in place for weeks as the Trump administration brings the case to the Supreme Court. Trump challenged the appellate court ruling and claimed the Supreme Court would likely keep his tariffs in place.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 late Friday that Trump overstepped his authority by issuing tariffs, as the court wrote the power to impose such tariffs is \u201cvested exclusively in the legislative branch\u201d and a \u201ccore Congressional power.\u201d Dissenting judges argued Trump\u2019s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)\u2014a 1977 law allowing the president to regulate international trade\u2014to justify his tariffs is not an \u201cunconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.\u201d The IEEPA neither mentions tariffs nor has \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d that set limits on the president\u2019s power to impose tariffs and does not \u201cgive the president wide-ranging authority\u201d to issue levies, the majority ruling said. The appellate court\u2019s ruling does not take effect until Oct. 14, however, allowing the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. \u201cThe president's tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,\u201d White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.\n\n\u201cALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social in criticism of the \u201cHighly Partisan\u201d appeals court. Trump claimed, \u201cIf these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the country.\u201d He suggested the Supreme Court would \u201chelp\u201d keep the tariffs in place for the \u201cbenefit of our Nation,\u201d adding if the appellate court\u2019s ruling is \u201callowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.\u201d\n\nWhat Happens If Trump\u2019s Tariffs Are Ruled Illegal?\n\nThe ruling covers Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs imposed on most U.S. trade partners, including additional rates on goods imported from China, Mexico and Canada. If upheld, the ruling would prevent the levies from being enforced, though other tariffs, including those imposed on steel, aluminum and copper, would remain in place because they were issued under a different presidential authority. It\u2019s not immediately clear how the ruling would impact trade deals reached between the U.S. and countries like Japan, South Korea and others in response to the tariffs, or how the broader financial market would react.\n\nTrump unveiled wide-reaching tariffs on U.S. trade partners earlier this year, claiming authority to do as he argued an international trade imbalance was harming national security. Friday\u2019s ruling upholds a decision from the Court of International Trade in May, which disputed Trump\u2019s authority to impose sweeping tariffs under the IEEPA, ruling in favor of a consolidated lawsuit filed by a dozen states and five small businesses. The Trump administration has argued courts previously approved President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in 1971 under earlier emergency powers legislation, though the Court of International Trade rejected the claim and said Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cexceed any authority granted to the president\u201d under the law.",

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said his tariffs are taking in \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d\u2014which matches estimates from some economists for revenue his levies could generate, but over the next decade, not so far this year.\nKey Facts\n\u201cTrillions of dollars are being taken in on tariffs,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, suggesting his levies have \u201cnot caused inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury\u2019s coffers.\u201d\nTrump leaves out that tariffs are paid by U.S. companies to import foreign goods, with those costs eventually paid by U.S. consumers.\nHow Much Revenue Has The U.s. Collected From Trump\u2019s Tariffs?\nThe U.S. has collected $142 billion from tariff revenue so far this fiscal year, which ends in September, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday. Since Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect in April, his levies have generated about $96 billion in revenue, after customs duties jumped to $28 billion in July, marking an annual increase of 273%. Customs duties accounted for $27 billion in revenue for June, $22 billion in May and $16 billion in April. Before Trump\u2019s tariffs were announced, customs duties totaled $8 billion in March and $7 billion in February and January. Customs duties are tariffs or taxes paid by importers in international trade, meaning companies, businesses or individuals in the U.S. are required to pay levies as goods enter the country. Consumers tend to carry the weight of tariff costs as companies adjust prices to offset or absorb the effects of tariffs.\nHow Much Revenue Will Trump\u2019s Tariffs Generate?\nEven Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told MSNBC earlier this month he expects tariffs would generate $300 billion annually, noting \u201cthere\u2019s a chance that could be higher\u201d in 2026. The Tax Foundation projected Trump\u2019s tariffs would raise about $2.5 trillion over the next decade, even as the levies will likely raise the price of common goods and taxes for the average household by nearly $1,300 in 2025 and $1,700 in 2026. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy nonprofit, expects Trump\u2019s tariffs to generate $2.8 trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product by fiscal year 2034 if they continue.\nHave Trump\u2019s Tariffs Influenced Inflation?\nInflation jumped lower than expected to 2.7% in July, though core consumer prices\u2014a measurement that excludes food and energy\u2014rose 3.1% year-over-year, matching a high this year set in January. It appears Trump\u2019s tariffs have raised prices, and some economists have warned his levies could hike costs through the end of the year. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief U.S. economist, Michael Feroli, argued in a note earlier this year that Trump\u2019s tariffs would result in \u201cmeaningfully larger increases\u201d to consumer prices and higher inflation at some point this year. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last month that while the U.S. economy was in a \u201csolid position,\u201d the effects of tariffs on the economy and inflation \u201cremain to be seen.\u201d\nTangent\nTrump said last month his administration would \u201cconsider\u201d sending checks based on the revenue his tariffs have generated. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a bill after Trump signaled interest in a rebate check, which would send at least $600 to each eligible adult and dependent child this year. A larger rebate check would be issued if tariff revenue exceeds projections, according to a draft of the bill, which reduces the rate by 5% to about $570 for joint filers with an adjusted gross income above $150,000, a head of household with an income above $112,500 or an individual whose income exceeds $75,000. The bill has yet to be considered."

  "argos_summary": "An appellate court ruled that most of President Trump\u2019s tariffs exceed his authority, declaring them illegal under the principle that tariff power is a core congressional function. The decision will not take effect until October 14, giving the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, while the tariffs remain in place for the interim. Trump maintains that the tariffs will stay and that the ruling would harm the country, while the court\u2019s majority cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as insufficient to grant tariff authority. The ruling covers reciprocal tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada, and others, though steel, aluminum and copper duties issued under different powers will remain. The case highlights the tension between executive trade actions and congressional authority, with potential implications for U.S. trade policy and market sentiment.",
