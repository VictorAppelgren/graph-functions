  "content": "''I don't think anyone's paying attention to that,'' right-hander George Kirby said. ''We're just playing baseball and doing our thing.''\n\nKirby led Seattle to its eighth straight win Tuesday night, 1-0 over the Baltimore Orioles, and about 90 minutes after he spoke in the clubhouse, the Mariners caught Houston in the AL West. The Astros lost 14-1 to Boston, dropping into a first-place tie with Seattle.\n\nSeattle is starting a road trip that also includes matchups with the Mets and Phillies. The Mariners have three more games against Houston in mid-September, and those will decide who wins the season series.\n\nKirby allowed three hits in seven innings on an 87-degree night that wasn't oppressive, but seemed to give closer Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz trouble when he began to feel lightheaded while pitching the ninth. The heat also altered Kirby's wardrobe.\n\n''First time I haven't worn sleeves in probably two years, which was nice,'' Kirby said. ''I was just finding a way to cool down in the tunnel \u2014 some ice or whatever it is. It'll get you, so you just got to make sure you hydrate.''\n\nSince allowing 11 runs in 8 2/3 innings in his first two starts of the season, Kirby has shaved his ERA all the way down to 3.71. It's the first time all year that he has finished a game with it under 4.00.",
