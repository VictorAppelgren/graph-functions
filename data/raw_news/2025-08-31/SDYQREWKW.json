  "content": "\"I estimate that our facilitated transactions will exceed Swift's in the next five years,\" Sun, 35, said in an interview with the South China Morning Post. He added that the transaction volume through Tron was already expected to reach US$8 trillion this year.\n\n\"In the future, we can easily boost the transaction volume to US$300 trillion or US$400 trillion,\" Sun said. \"It won't be a surprise if we could handle transactions 10 times or even 100 times larger than Swift.\"\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nSun pointed out that Swift is processing transactions in days. By comparison, \"Tron is facilitating transactions in seconds\", he said.\n\nHis confidence reflects the growing influence of the Tron blockchain in stablecoin transactions globally. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that has a fixed value by being pegged to a reference asset, such as the US dollar.\n\nCryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun expects the transaction volume through his Tron blockchain to reach US$8 trillion this year. Photo: Nora Tam\n\nAt the recent WebX2025 conference held in Tokyo, Sun touted that Tether USDT issuances on Tron have surpassed US$82 billion, which has made the blockchain the world's largest network for these transactions.\n\nFacing competition from other blockchain systems such as Ethereum, Tron recently slashed network fees by 60 per cent to woo more users to his platform.\n\n\"I am optimistic about Hong Kong's role in crypto over the long run,\" he said. \"I don't think Hong Kong authorities have much choice. By positioning itself as a financial centre, the city can't avoid embracing crypto.\"\n\nOn the situation in mainland China, Sun said he expected the world's second-largest economy to eventually embrace cryptocurrencies after years of maintaining a hostile regulatory stance.\n\n\"The trend of technology will not change,\" he said, adding that it was \"just a matter of time\" for China to embrace cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"The speed of the process is up to regulators,\" Sun said. \"As crypto industry players, we have to continuously showcase our successful experiences to convince the regulators.\"\n\n\"Like the safety concern over space flight, if 100 successful experiments are not enough, we can go 500 times, 1,000 times and 10,000 times,\" he said. \"There will be a final threshold.\"",
