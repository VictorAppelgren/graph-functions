  "content": "Film star Gerard Depardieu, one of the leading faces of French cinema, will face trial for allegedly raping actress Charlotte Arnould in 2018, in the latest blow to his reputation after he was convicted of sexual assault earlier this year.\n\nArnould first accused Depardieu of rape in 2018, saying the assaults occurred in his Paris home on two separate occasions when she was in her early 20s. Depardieu, 76, has denied wrongdoing in the case.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor\u2019s office confirmed on Tuesday that an investigating judge had ruled that the case should be sent before a court after Arnould posted about the news on her Instagram account. No court date was given.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m having trouble realizing how huge this is. I\u2019m relieved,\u201d Arnould wrote.\n\nLawyers for Arnould and Depardieu did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nYears after first rising to prominence in 1974 with \u201cGoing Places\u201d and starring in scores of French-language movies, Depardieu has been at the centre of a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years.\n\nArnould, 29, an actress and former ballet dancer known for her work in theatre and voice acting, was present in the courtroom in May when Depardieu was found guilty in a separate case of sexually assaulting two women on a film set and handed an 18-month suspended prison sentence, which his lawyer said at the time he would appeal.\n\nDuring that trial, Depardieu\u2019s lawyer called her a liar in the courtroom.\n\nIn her Instagram post on Tuesday, Arnould referred to those comments, calling Depardieu\u2019s defense \u201coutrageous and\u2026absolutely unnecessary to uncover the truth.\u201d\n\nThough Arnould\u2019s case was initially dropped, it was reopened in 2020 and prosecutors requested a trial for Depardieu in 2022.\n\nArnould has since become a vocal figure in France\u2019s #MeToo movement, expressing solidarity with sexual assault victims and demanding accountability in the film industry.",

      "text": "The trial of G\u00e9rard Depardieu, who has been accused of sexually assaulting two women on a movie set in 2021, began on Monday after a five-month delay due to the French actor\u2019s poor health.\nThe 76-year-old arrived in the courtroom wearing a formal black suit, smiling as he walked in holding his lawyer\u2019s shoulder.\nHe faces charges of allegedly assaulting the women while filming \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d or \u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d.\nDepardieu was accused in both cases of using \u201cviolence, coercion, surprise, or threat\u201d in the alleged assaults, by trapping the victims between his legs and groping their buttocks, genitals, and chest\u201d over their clothing according to the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office.\nDepardieu has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, told CNN that his client \u201ccategorically disputes the facts and says the accusations are all false.\u201d\nCarine Durrieu-Diebolt, a lawyer of one of the women, said her client was seeking \u201ca recognition of the facts\u201d in light of Depardieu\u2019s denials. She said the two women are waiting for \u201cjudicial recognition, an official acknowledgement by the justice system that they were victims of sexual assaults.\u201d\nWith more than 240 films under his belt, Depardieu is one of France\u2019s most prolific and famous actors. Internationally, he is known for his roles in films like \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Man in the Iron Mask\u201d and \u201cLife of Pi.\u201d He was also nominated for an Oscar in 1991 for his role in \u201cCyrano de Bergerac.\u201d\nIn a separate case, the actor is facing charges of rape and sexual assault against actress Charlotte Arnould, allegedly committed in August 2018, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office.\nThe French actor has denied all accusations against him. \u201cNever, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in a letter published in France\u2019s Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023. \u201cHurting a woman would be like kicking my own mother in the stomach,\u201d he added.\nMonths later, French President Emmanuel Macron drew criticism after describing Depardieu\u2019s situation as a \u201cmanhunt\u201d in comments on French TV and expressing his admiration for \u201can immense actor\u201d who is \u201cmaking France proud.\u201d\nThe support was not well received by many in France, including by former president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande who declared: \u201cNo, we are not proud of G\u00e9rard Depardieu! \u2026 what was expected of the President of the Republic was to talk about the women rather than stating that G\u00e9rard Depardieu is a great actor.\u201d\nMacron later walked back his remarks, in an interview with ELLE magazine in May 2024, insisting he \u201cnever defended an aggressor against its victims\u201d but that the presumption of innocence should be respected.\nInvestigative journalist Marine Turchi has interviewed more than 20 women who allegedly faced sexual harassment or attacks at the hands of the actor, with some testimonies of abuse dating back to 1985. Some of these allegations would be subject to the statute of limitations; Depardieu denies all the claims made.\n\u201cThe world of cinema is typically a place where there can be abuses of power. It\u2019s a setting with a very strong hierarchy, where highly powerful decision-makers \u2013 often still men \u2013 interact with freelancers, technicians, makeup artists, extras, actresses, and others who have no power,\u201d Turchi, who writes for the French online newspaper Mediapart, told CNN.\nTurchi believes France\u2019s smaller film industry \u2013 in comparison to Hollywood \u2013 makes speaking up harder. \u201cYou can very quickly be identified as the person who spoke up, someone who might be seen as a bit troublesome,\u201d she said.\nDepardieu\u2019s legal woes extend further, with the actor also under investigation for \u201ctax fraud, aggravated tax fraud, and money laundering,\u201d a judicial source told CNN.\nIn 2013, Depardieu set up residence in the Belgian village of N\u00e9chin, adjacent to the border with France. The small town with a population of just over 2,000 people initially welcomed him as an honorary citizen, but he was stripped of the title in 2023 following the allegations of sexual misconduct.\nInvestigators suspect that the actor never lived there and the property was set up to avoid paying taxes in France. Searches were carried out in France and Belgium last month to determine if his Belgian tax domicile was fictitious.\n\u201cThe tax authorities have been trying for years to establish fraud, without success; they are now attempting through criminal proceedings,\u201d Assous, Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, told CNN.\nMonday\u2019s sexual assault trial is scheduled to last two days, with a verdict expected a few weeks after. If found guilty, the French actor could face up to five years in prison and a \u20ac75,000 ($81,000) fine.\nCNN\u2019s Dalal Mawad contributed to this story."

      "text": "A court in Paris on Tuesday found French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and handed him an 18-month suspended prison sentence, in a fall from grace for a towering figure of French cinema.\nIn one of the highest-profile #MeToo cases to come before judges in France, Depardieu repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he would appeal the court\u2019s decision.\nDepardieu, 76, was a towering figure in French cinema, starring in more than 200 films over five decades, including \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro\u201d and \u201cCyrano de Bergerac.\u201d\nHis trial marked a moment of reckoning for the #MeToo protest movement over sexual violence, which has failed to gain the same traction in France as in the United States, although there are signs that social attitudes are changing.\nOne of the two plaintiffs, Amelie K, a set decorator now aged 54, told the court the actor had groped her all over her body as he trapped her between his legs and made explicit sexual comments on set in 2021.\n\u201cI was terrified, he was laughing,\u201d she recounted.\nDepardieu, who denied sexual assault, had argued before the court that he did not consider placing a hand on a person\u2019s buttocks sexual assault and that some women were too easily shocked.\nHanding down his sentence, the presiding judge, Thierry Donard, said of Depardieu: \u201cHe does not seem to have grasped either the concept of consent or the deleterious and traumatic consequences of his behaviour towards the women he assaulted.\u201d\nHe ordered Depardieu, who was not in court for the verdict, to be put on a list of sex offenders.\n#MeToo reckoning\nDepardieu has figured prominently in the debate over the #MeToo movement in France, as he faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations that put a spotlight on how women are treated in the movie industry.\nProsecutors say he should face trial in a separate rape investigation, following allegations brought by actress Charlotte Arnould, 29, who said she could not bear remaining silent any longer.\nMore than a dozen women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence, though not all have filed complaints.\nDepardieu has consistently denied wrongdoing. \u201cNever, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in an open letter in the daily Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023.\nThe Depardieu trial laid bare a generational divide in France over sexism.\nEarlier during the investigation, a group of 50 French stars, including Carla Bruni, wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, denounced what they called the \u201clynching\u201d of Depardieu.\nBrigitte Bardot, 90, told BFM TV this week that \u201cthose who have talent and grope a girl get thrown into the gutter.\u201d\nWomen\u2019s rights campaigners say they have seen a shift in attitudes in France - notably following the case of Gisele Pelicot whose ex-husband was convicted last year of inviting dozens of men to rape her after drugging her unconscious.\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly a victory and a step forward. We\u2019re making progress,\u201d Amelie K. told reporters after the verdict."

      "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is part of As Equals, CNN\u2019s ongoing series on gender inequality. For information about how the series is funded and more, check out our FAQs.\nAll names of minors have been changed at their request to protect their identities.\nA boundary wall separates Baseco\u2019s residents from Manila Bay, a natural harbor in the heart of the Philippine capital. Over 64,000 people live in the densely packed compound, their homes made of concrete blocks and scrap materials, covered by corrugated roofs reinforced with tarp, making them prone to flooding.\nAmong the residents is 14-year-old Clara, who lives towards the periphery of the informal settlement. Wearing an oversized black T-shirt with graffiti prints, Clara\u2019s small frame subtly reveals the bump around her waist. Now six months pregnant, the young mother-to-be hopes of having a boy. \u201cI want him to be like my older brother. I don\u2019t want him to end up like me,\u201d she tells CNN.\nClara says that at school, sex education \u201cwasn\u2019t taught in our class\u2026 we had different topics in science class.\u201d Had she known more about reproductive health, Clara believes she would have avoided getting pregnant so young.\nClara is one of an increasing number of girls, between ages 10 and 14, who have become pregnant in their early adolescence. Stories like hers are at the heart of a fierce debate between lawmakers, health experts and church groups over what the future of sex education should look like in this deeply Catholic country.\nCNN spoke with several Filipino girls and young women between the ages of 14 and 23, including mothers, who said they had either not had any sex education at school, or if they had, it lacked helpful information about consent or contraceptives. One of the women, Sam, 23, remembers learning about contraceptives in an 8th grade class, with a disclaimer not to use them.\nDoctor Aileen Marie Rubio from Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital in Manila said most teens have \u201cvery limited knowledge on reproductive health, consent and what is considered abuse.\u201d Rubio, who works with the hospital\u2019s dedicated clinic for adolescent mums, said most teens didn\u2019t know they could get pregnant if they had sex.\nClara met her boyfriend through friends and became pregnant just six months into the relationship. Though she is due to give birth in three months\u2019 time, she has not been to any antenatal checkups and knows little about the health of the baby. \u201cI have no money yet\u2026 to go to hospital.\u201d\nBut experts say mothers this young face much higher health risks during pregnancy and labor \u2013 and so do their babies.\nA \u2018national social emergency\u2019\nIn the Philippines, child and teen pregnancies are amongst the highest in Asia. While there has been a slight decline in pregnancies among 15 \u2013 19-year-olds between 2019 and 2023, alarm bells are now ringing over a stark rise in pregnancies among very young girls \u2013 those aged 14 and younger \u2013 up 38% from 2,411 in 2019 to 3,343 in 2023.\nGovernment bodies have long declared teen pregnancies a \u201cnational social emergency,\u201d and in 2022 lawmakers filed the earliest draft of an Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Bill aimed at tackling the problem.\nThree years on, the bill is still working its way through the legal process, after multiple amendments, and the most recent refile last month, following fierce opposition from conservative organizations and church groups.\nThe bill aims to standardize comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) in schools and improve access to sexual health services. Currently, teens younger than 18 need parental consent to access contraceptives, with some exceptions.\n\u201cWhether we like it or not, according to the data, there are adolescents who are sexually active now,\u201d Sen. Risa Hontiveros, the principal author of the bill, said in a statement earlier this year. She added that the bill \u201cis needed to empower adolescents to protect themselves.\u201d\nBut an earlier edition of the bill faced fierce opposition from church groups across the deeply Catholic state. The Catholic Church believes intercourse should only happen between married couples and teaches abstinence for all others. The church also disapproves of artificial contraception but permits natural methods of avoiding pregnancy within marriage. Abortion is illegal in all circumstances in the Philippines, including after rape or incest.\nThis opposition recently culminated in a combined lobbying effort by a coalition of at least eight evangelical and catholic organizations across the country, known as Project Dalisay.\nStarted as an initiative of the National Coalition for the Family and the Constitution, Project Dalisay \u2013 or Project Pure \u2013 interprets the bill as a combatant against its ideologies on sex and parental authority, and its main point of contention revolves around CSE.\nThe project\u2019s convenor, Maria Lourdes Sereno, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in the Philippines, tells CNN that CSE \u201cintends to normalize sexual discussion, which is not part of Filipino culture.\u201d The initiative \u201csprang as a voluntary group of faith believers, largely from the evangelical and catholic communities\u201d to \u201cvoice parents\u2019 objections largely to the Senate Bill.\u201d\nTaking inspiration from America\nIn early January, Project Dalisay launched a website which included a petition against the bill and an explainer video titled \u201cUnmasking the Perils of CSE.\u201d\nThe site pointed to 15 \u201charmful effects\u201d of CSE, taken from resources by US-based anti-abortion organization Family Watch International (FWI). They included eroticizing condom use and promoting \u201cgender confusion.\u201d\nFWI told CNN its research into CSE programs across several continents had found them to be \u201cage inappropriate, scientifically and medically inaccurate \u2026 and ineffective in preventing teen pregnancy.\u201d\nAnother US anti-abortion group, Human Life International (HLI)\u2019s country head in the Philippines, Dr Rene Bullecer, has vocally backed Project Dalisay. HLI\u2019s President, Father Shenan J. Boquet, also denounced the bill, saying that it posed \u201ca significant threat to the societal, moral, and spiritual foundations of the Philippines,\u201d in a lengthy statement to CNN. He added that parents \u201chave the most direct responsibility for their children,\u201d and the State should assist parents \u2013 \u201cnot usurp them.\u201d\nProject Dalisay\u2019s Sereno tells CNN she has taken leads from such US groups but denies any financial ties. \u201cWe look for information, the technical information, the science from the US,\u201d she says.\nThe anti-CSE content became the basis of what critics called a \u201cmisleading\u201d campaign, with Project Dalisay claiming that the bill\u2019s implementation of CSE as guided by international standards would include inappropriate concepts \u2014 something Sen. Hontiveros refuted.\nWhen asked about Project Dalisay\u2019s controversial claims about the bill, Sereno told CNN that she \u201cwasn\u2019t manufacturing anything.\u201d\nMembers of Project Dalisay also joined public hearings in which the bill was debated in an attempt to sway views.\nBy the end of January, several senators who previously backed the bill withdrew their support, and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., once a public supporter of the bill, vowed to veto it in its then-form.\nIn response to the \u201csevere backlash,\u201d Jaye Bekema, the chief legislative officer for Sen. Hontiveros, told CNN amendments were made. This included removal of the phrase guided by \u201cinternational standards\u201d and the addition of a line ensuring \u201cparental authority or academic and religious freedom.\u201d Mentions of abortion and contraception have also been cut.\nThe latest version of the bill was refiled last month and will now face several rounds of committee hearings and readings by lawmakers.\nJolted from girlhood to motherhood\nMeanwhile, 15-year-old Jude is grappling with her new identity as a young mother, telling CNN she first learned about sex from her much older partner. The young girl dropped out of school at the age of 14, when she was eight months pregnant, and moved in with her then 21-year-old boyfriend, whose family she still lives with. This 7-year age gap is the average for young mothers, according to a study funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\nThe non-profit Family Planning Organisation of the Philippines (FPOP) is now supporting Jude with family planning measures and sharing resources available to allow her to continue her studies. They tell CNN that Jude\u2019s case \u201chighlights a critical concern regarding consent, power imbalance, and decision-making within young relationships.\u201d\nPregnancy in girls below the age of 16 is also three times riskier than in older women, explains Dr Junice Melgar, the Executive Director at Likhaan, a non-governmental organization in the Philippines.\nYoung girls are not physically or mentally ready to carry babies and are not seeking care if they become pregnant, says Melgar. \u201cAnd especially if there\u2019s a lot of stigma; they are not encouraged to seek care.\u201d\nAccording to the World Health Organization, child and teenage mothers face higher risks of eclampsia (seizures), postpartum endometritis (inflamed lining of their uterus due to infection after birth) and systemic infections than women who are 20\u201324 years old. Babies of adolescent mothers also face higher risks of low birth weight, preterm birth and severe neonatal conditions.\nNGOs such as Likhaan work to bridge the gap in sexual and reproductive health services by visiting communities they say need it most.\nCNN followed their team of young volunteers in underprivileged areas of Malabon, a city close to Manila, where children play outside in the streets, and teenagers hang around near snack shops.\nWelcomed by the community, volunteers talk to young people about gender and relationships. They also approach parents, handing them pamphlets on how to speak with their children about sex.\nVolunteers target a basketball court in the community, where young men gather, and hand out a safe sex kit, which includes condoms.\nFor young girls such as Clara, these materials could have been lifechanging, enabling her to stay in school and resume her childhood. \u201cI feel sad. I want to go to school,\u201d she tells CNN. Even if she were in a position to go, she admits she may feel \u201cashamed to.\u201d\nClara hopes to give birth in hospital and says until now the only support she has received is from her mother. The looming birth scares her. \u201cI was told by many that it is going to be painful,\u201d she says.\nShe still hopes to eventually finish school one day, and hopes her child has better opportunities than she did. \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d she says.\nCredits\nReporter: Sashikala VP\nCorrespondent: Hanako Montgomery\nEditors: Meera Senthilingam, Sheena McKenzie, Hilary Whiteman\nCameraperson, Video editor and Photography: Tom Booth\nSenior video producers : Ladan Anoushfar\nField producers: Yasmin Coles, Angus Watson\nPhoto editor: Catherine Phillips\nData editors: Carlotta Dotto, Henrik Petterson\nOSINT researcher: Wayne Chang"

  "argos_summary": "French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu is set to stand trial for allegedly raping actress Charlotte Arnould in 2018, following a prior conviction for sexual assault on a film set. The case was reopened in 2022 after Arnould\u2019s accusations were initially dropped, and prosecutors have now moved to a court hearing after her public Instagram post. Depardieu denies the allegations, while Arnould has become a vocal figure in France\u2019s #MeToo movement. The trial adds to a series of legal challenges confronting the actor, who has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.",
