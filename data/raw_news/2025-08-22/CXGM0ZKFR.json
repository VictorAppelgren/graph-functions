  "content": "FARC dissidents, who rejected a 2016 peace deal with the government, and the Gulf Clan are both active in Antioquia and heavily involved in cocaine production.\n\nAuthorities said the helicopter was transporting police officers as part of an operation to destroy coca leaf crops, the raw material for cocaine.\n\nMr Petro said an alleged member of the dissident group was arrested in the area of the explosion.\n\nAndres Julian, the governor of Antioquia, said a drone attacked the helicopter as it flew over coca leaf crops. The attack is thought to have caused a fire onboard.\n\nIn Cali, unknown attackers threw two cylinder bombs at Marco Fidel Su\u00e1rez military airbase, which exploded on the busy street.\n\n\u201cCali is once again the victim of a narco-terrorist attack,\u201d said Alejandro Eder, the mayor of Colombia\u2019s third-largest city, which is close to the violent region of Cauca.\n\nIn March, FARC dissidents launched eight simultaneous attacks across Cauca, including motorcycle bombs and drones carrying explosives, which is a region with many coca crops on a major drug trafficking route.\n\nMr Petro travelled to Cali after the attack, which he said came after FARC dissidents had suffered a defeat at the hands of the military.\n\nHe said on X that one of the perpetrators had been detained in Cali, where two people were killed in explosions in June.\n\n\u201cTerrorism is the new expression of the factions...which have submitted to the control of the drug trafficking junta,\u201d he said, adding that the government \u201casks the world to consider the drug trafficking cartel as a terrorist organisation.\u201d\n\nMr Eder has offered a reward of \u00a374,000 for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the attack on the airbase. Another \u00a374,000 was offered by regional authorities.\n\nColombia\u2019s Ministry of Defence said it would offer rewards of up to \u00a337,000 for anything information allowing them to \u201canticipate any terrorist attack in the country.\u201d",
