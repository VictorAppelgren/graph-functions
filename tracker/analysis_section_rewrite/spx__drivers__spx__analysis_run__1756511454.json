      "feedback": "The draft contains no substantive analysis—just a refusal statement—so it fails every acceptance gate. To upgrade it to a world‑class view, start by selecting a canonical handle that aligns with the SECTION FOCUS (e.g., ust10y, spx, dxy). State a clear directional bias (e.g., “UST 10‑yr yield will rise 10–15 bp over the next 3 months”), quantify the magnitude, and tie the sign to a specific catalyst window (e.g., “Fed’s next policy meeting on May 15 + the release of US PCE data on May 10”). Provide a causal chain: Fed rate hike → higher term premium → 10‑yr yield ↑ → spx ↓ 0.5 % → dxy ↑ 0.3 %. Each claim must be backed by an inline citation (e.g., (ABC‑123)), and you should explicitly note any fragile points (e.g., “if PCE surprises below 2.0 % the upside may be muted”). Avoid generic platitudes, include numeric ranges, and ensure the analysis is concise (≤ 3 sentences) yet fully meets the mapping, catalyst, and quantification requirements.",
