      "feedback": "Strong start: you correctly delivered 2 Up and 2 Down movers within a 3–6 month horizon and anchored each line to identifiable regime drivers (AI/productivity, capex/tariff, governance frictions, and security/policy shocks) with source IDs, and you provided a follow‑on Outlook line with triggers. However, to reach world‑class quality you should tighten the causal chain, sharpen the format, and harden the quantitative discipline. Specific edits: (1) fix the Outlook to the mandated 1-line (or max 2) schema with a true Direction (Up/Down) and the 8 fields, e.g., Direction: Up | Horizon: 3–6 months | Expected path/levels: S&P at or near highs, dollar weaker | Decision signals: SEP FOMC guidance, tariff cadence clarity, Apple capex milestones, payroll/inflation prints | Invalidation: hotter inflation or hawkish Fed, renewed tariff escalation | Trigger: SEP decision, tariff moves, Apple milestones | Probability %: 60 | Confidence: 60. Do not prepend with “Outlook:” and remove the extra prose. (2) Elevate first‑principles grounding by adding a one‑sentence causal spine per line that links driver to price path (e.g., AI productivity uplifts software/device marginal value → tech multiples re-rate; governance frictions raise risk premia and cap exit economics; sustained price promotions constrain margins → consumer/staples equities under pressure; policy shocks inject episodic volatility → risk assets repriced). (3) Condense “What to watch” into a single crisp metric per line and tie each to a concrete trigger (e.g., Gemini rollout cadence ≥ scheduled milestone; Apple capex announcement by date; a tariff decision crossing a defined threshold or court block; a named security incident with timelined trigger). (4) Calibrate probabilities to explicit evidence or near-term catalysts in the material; if you cite 60/50/40/35, attach a short justification next to each line or reference the exact trigger cadence in the line (e.g., “based on Apple capex cadence and tariff uncertainty in 9JYRMPXB0/47020006”); avoid opaque or self‑referential confidence without visible linkage. (5) Ensure consistency and avoid filler: keep each mover line strictly within the 5 fields, and ensure every driver, “What to watch,” and probability is directly traceable to IDs in the SOURCE MATERIAL; if any line relies on cross‑domain interpretation, surface a one‑sentence reconciliation for base vs optimistic vs pessimistic paths. (6) If the asset truly is tradable and fits Swing Trade, convert the Outlook into 1–2 Swing Trade lines with explicit Direction, Horizon, Entry/Stop/Target, R/R, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability, and Confidence; if not tradable, keep the tight Outlook but ensure it is a single, clean line per the spec. (7) Finally, prune the draft’s extra explanatory paragraphs outside the 4 movers + 1 Outlook structure to meet the exact format constraint and improve readability.",
