  "title": "The Best Smokeless Fire Pits",
  "description": "On a chilly evening, we like to cluster around the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 (for smaller yards) or the Tiki Patio Smokeless Fire Pit (for larger yards).",
  "content": "A lightweight option for moving in and out of storage The simple form and stainless steel finish may be exactly the minimalist effect you want\u2014or it may look more like a dryer drum to you. But the light weight of the Bonfire 2.0 makes it a pit that you can drag out to use and then hide away when it cools off. Get this if: You want a fire pit that\u2019s small and light enough to move easily from storage (say, in a garage or under a cover) onto a patio. If you buy the add-on stand, you can even use it on a deck. It\u2019s easy to use, easy to store, and easy to move around. Like all the fire pits we tested, the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 is easy to load with wood and easy to light\u2014though due to the pit diameter (at 17.5 inches, it\u2019s smaller than our other picks), you have to stack standard-size logs carefully to make them fit. It is half the weight of any of our other picks, which makes it very portable. It\u2019s almost smokeless. None of the pits we tested are truly smokeless, including this one. However, once it gets burning, the Bonfire does eat up a lot of the extra smoke; by our admittedly rudimentary estimation, the fire pit reduces smoke by about 70% to 80%. (We compared a fire in the Bonfire with an open wood fire by burning them side by side, using wood from the same source.) The Bonfire comes with a nylon carrying case. It comes in several sizes and configurations. Solo Stove offers a smaller size (the Ranger 2.0, which is 15 inches in diameter) and a larger size (the Yukon 2.0, which is 27 inches in diameter) and sells a grill grate accessory kit (we haven\u2019t tested it yet). The current (2.0) models of the Bonfire, Ranger, and Yukon come with a removable ash pan and grate. This updated design fixed the one obvious flaw of earlier models\u2014you had to turn the stove over to dump out the ash\u2014so the entire unit is much easier to clean and hose down after a fire. One nice thing about all smokeless fire pits: They leave behind very little ash compared with a regular fire. Still, some cleanup is required. If you\u2019re worried about sparks, there\u2019s an accessory for that too. One of our testers lives in a high fire-risk area in Southern California\u2014where flying embers are not ideal\u2014so she also tested the Solo Stove Bonfire Shield, a stainless steel two-piece spark screen that sits on the rim of the fire pit. It\u2019s not a cheap accessory: around $160 for the Bonfire size (medium). But like the fire pit, it\u2019s well made, and she found it nice to have a spark screen that fits just right. It comes with two tools that help you remove the lid to add more wood while the fire is going. (You can easily store it upside down inside the fire pit when neither are in use.)\n\u2022 One perhaps unforeseen consequence of the smoke-reducing after-burn effect from all smokeless fire pit designs: All of that gas redirection seems to project the heat of the fire straight into the air, cutting down on a lot of the radiant heat you might expect to feel when sitting near a regular fire pit. To mitigate this, Solo offers a heat deflector for each model, which redirects the heat of the stove back to everyone sitting around the fire.\n\u2022 As with any fire pit, a Solo Stove model should not be left out in the rain without a cover; the rain will mix with the ash and form corrosive agents. Solo Stove makes a fabric cover and a metal cover, though a metal lid from a 20-gallon trash can also does the trick.\n\nAvoiding the industrial look of most smokeless fire pits, this has a gentler backyard aesthetic. Though the ashtray is somewhat flimsy, it is simple to remove and clean. Get this if: You want a sturdy, classic-looking, easy-to-clean fire pit that blends in on your patio. It\u2019ll fit right in. The Tiki Patio Smokeless Fire Pit is one pit you\u2019ll probably want to leave in place once you set it up; its more classic patio look doesn\u2019t stand out as aggressively as the designs of our other picks. This model feels almost as if someone placed a heavier skin around a Solo Stove Bonfire with excellent results. Removing the ashes is easier with the Tiki fire pit than with some of our other picks. It\u2019s easy to clean after your fire and easy to store when not in use. The Tiki fire pit has a simple-to-withdraw ash-collection plate, which makes cleaning the pit after use fairly easy. Smokeless fire pits, because of their \u201creburning\u201d effect (which recycles the smoke and particles through the fire pit), tend to produce a very fine and easy-to-clean ash without much debris, but in contrast to the Tiki model, many of the pits we tested require turning over and dumping out to clean. Tiki also sells wood-pellet packs as fuel or starter bags, and they\u2019re easy to use, but you don\u2019t need them to start a fire. Like most fire pits, you need to protect its interior from rain; the Tiki fire pit comes with a cover that fits nicely over the entire pit. The add-on spark screen is easy to use. Tiki sells a stainless steel spark screen kit, the Tiki Patio Screen and Poker, for its fire pit. Our tester in Southern California lives in a high fire-risk area, where keeping sparks and embers contained is essential; she tested this kit along with the Solo Stove screen. The Tiki screen comes with a poker-style tool that you can use to remove the screen when it\u2019s hot and to rearrange logs (the tool also has a handy bottle opener on the handle end). The screen makes the stove\u2019s opening a little smaller, but our tester didn\u2019t have any problems reaching in to tend the fire. We also like that you can remove the lid and hang it off the rim while you add more logs.\n\u2022 Our only complaint so far is that the Tiki fire pit, like all smokeless pits, doesn\u2019t radiate as much heat as you might like on a cool evening. Tiki does sell a compatible heat deflector to mitigate this issue.\n\nBest fire pit for heavy use: Blue Sky The Peak Smokeless Patio Fire Pit 2.0 Best fire pit for heavy use If you don\u2019t mind the Peak\u2019s stealth-bomber looks, the price is irresistible for a sturdy and well-made smokeless fire pit. Get this if: You want a heavy-build fire pit with a bargain price. It\u2019s built well but doesn\u2019t cost a lot. The hefty weight (nearly 50 pounds) and solid construction of Blue Sky\u2019s The Peak Smokeless Patio Fire Pit 2.0 make it a bargain. There\u2019s not much more to it than that. The gray patina can be striking in the right setting. It\u2019s better for large logs. The Peak has a wider diameter than most fire pits we tested, so you can more easily stack standard logs, without having to set them up like a pyramid. If you prefer to burn large split logs, this fire pit may be a good choice. (Blue Sky makes a spark screen for the Peak.) It\u2019s now easier to clean. In the 2.0 incarnation of its fire pit, Blue Sky updated the ash collection, a former small flaw in our eyes, with a much easier system. To clean out the Peak, simply reach inside after everything has cooled and pull out the ash collection tray. The tray is similar to the Solo Stove\u2019s except it has handles, which might be a small improvement over our top pick if you\u2019re splitting hairs.\n\u2022 This one comes down to aesthetics. The whole thing looks like a piece that fell off a stealth bomber or an alien aircraft\u2014if that\u2019s to your taste, you\u2019ll enjoy this fire pit. Over the years the Peak will fade into a muted gray color, which can be very striking depending on your location and vista. The bold laser-cut branding along the lower edge is eye-catching, for better or worse.\n\nThe two-piece construction and wood-handle details separate this pit from the rest, but so does the jaw-dropping price. Get this if: You want the highest-quality fire pit\u2014one you can buy for life\u2014and don\u2019t mind spending a lot to get it. A unique design makes it easier to clean and move. The Burly Scout Fire Pit is the only pit we tested that comes in two pieces (an outer cylinder and an insert that nests inside). So it removes two of the hassles you might expect with smokeless fire pits: cleaning and moving. Of all the pits we tested, it\u2019s the most obviously well-built option, and it\u2019s equally overengineered. But it does cost a lot. Are you potentially overpaying for a \u201cMade in the USA\u201d stamp, sturdy wooden handles, high-quality steel, and hand welding? Probably. But if you want to know you\u2019re buying the absolute best construction with a handsome look that none of the other pits we tested can mimic, this fire pit is your only choice.\n\u2022 The Scout Fire Pit is incredibly tough, but it\u2019s also expensive; we wish the company still offered its original lifetime warranty. (It now offers a limited two-year warranty, which covers any defects in material due to workmanship under normal use.)\n\u2022 As of 2023, Burly no longer makes the Scout in the stainless steel finish we originally tested; now it comes only in carbon steel with a matte-black finish. The company makes a slightly larger pit in the same design, called the Gather Fire Pit. Both the Gather and the Scout have corresponding lids available.\n\nIf our top pick from Tiki is unavailable: Consider the Cuisinart Cleanburn Fire Pit, which looks somewhat similar to the Tiki model\u2014maybe even a touch more refined. However, unlike our other picks, the Cuisinart fire pit is a hassle to clean. The main body unscrews from an ash pan (similar to the Blue Sky model\u2019s design), but the rounded basket design and the peculiar weight of the fire pit itself make this process unwieldy. If you wish you could take the Breeo X Series on the road: Consider the Breeo Y Series Portable Smokeless Fire Pit. From a cooking and design perspective, the two Breeo lines are largely identical. The Y Series is more portable than the X Series: It comes with collapsible handles and spring-loaded feet, which you can set at two height levels. If you see yourself potentially bringing a stove to a remote location for fire and cooking\u2014while truck camping, for instance\u2014then the Y Series is a fine choice. But if you\u2019re looking for a backyard fire pit, you\u2019ll probably prefer the sturdiness of the slightly more expensive X Series.\n\nBiolite FirePit+: Unlike other smokeless fire pit designs, which employ the heat transfer and airflow through their double-wall designs to create secondary combustion, the Biolite FirePit+ uses an electric fan to force air into the pile of wood. It works extremely efficiently, and the fire pit is especially lightweight. However, the device as a whole feels poorly built, of weak materials\u2014especially the mesh grill enclosure, which is made of thin pressed metal that, in our experience, has been prone to rust and brittle spots after exposure to high heat. We\u2019ve already encountered some wear on our testing unit, after only a few uses. For the price, we\u2019re not convinced this pit is worth the investment. Inno Stage Smokeless Fire Pit: This fire pit is made of two metal pieces that stack when you\u2019re using it. It\u2019s a simple design and certainly keeps the cost low. But the overall lower quality of the metal and small size of the fire pit prevent this from being a pick.",

A source who is in a position to derive personal or professional benefit from what they are talking about could open our work up to the perception of bias.\nPresent information honestly\nDon\u2019t plagiarize others\u2019 work. Cite studies and other sources used. If you include information verbatim from a source, use quotation marks around their exact language.\nBe transparent about corrections\nIf an article requires a correction, work with the research and standards team to fix errors as swiftly as possible.\nWrite about people with sensitivity\nRefer to ethnic, racial, or socioeconomic status, disabilities or medical conditions, gender and sexual orientation, or size and appearance only when relevant for readers to understand our work. When you do so, use accurate, sensitive, and up-to-date language.\nPreserve our editorial independence with regard to the products we test\nDon\u2019t accept unsolicited or free products even if they are sent along with products you\u2019ve requested. Any test products that we have not chosen as a pick should be returned to the companies that lent them, donated, or, when products cannot or should not be reused, recycled when possible or disposed of.\nBe mindful on social media\nYou are perceived as a representative of Wirecutter and The New York Times when you speak publicly. Represent yourself in a manner that does not undercut the journalistic reputation of Wirecutter or The New York Times. This includes being mindful of expressing partisan opinions or promoting political views in public.\nAccuracy\nTo ensure our readers\u2019 trust, accuracy is paramount. We aim to verify that every fact we publish is supported by a reputable internal or external source, that it\u2019s properly attributed, and that the information is presented in context. We guard against assumptions and subjective statements masking as facts by thoroughly double-checking our work line by line. When we do use information from outside sources, we focus on original, primary sources whenever possible.\nReporting on news that\u2019s unfolding\nIf we mention news that is unfolding, we\u2019re judicious in our word choices about what we know and don\u2019t know. For example, if a lawsuit is announced citing wrongdoing by a company, we use words such as alleged to describe the wrongdoing until we know otherwise.\nUsing authoritative sources\nWirecutter is a workplace full of experts and knowledgeable sources, but we also consult authoritative primary sources and secondary sources. A source is anyone or anything that gives us information. We must thoroughly check the sources we rely on to make sure they\u2019re trustworthy and authoritative.\nWriters should reference the most authoritative, mainstream, and widely accepted sources on a subject.\n- Wirecutter journalists reporting on a specialized topic within a field of study should seek out an expert in that particular topic, not just one with a general degree in the field.\n- If you are discussing product safety, include information from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, rather than a retailer website.\n- When you\u2019re talking about health information, cite the CDC, FDA, AMA, or other relevant professional medical body, for instance, rather than an individual article or a popular health website.\n- Use blogs and message boards only in a careful and contextualized way by linking to any discussions being cited, for instance, in a particular subreddit. Anonymous posters on message boards, personal blogs (whether signed or not), and retailer websites rarely meet the standards of an authoritative source. In most cases, even if we know that a personal-blog article is presenting accurate information, we should find an official, authoritative source for the information.\nFinding the original source is best, so long as that source doesn\u2019t place an undue burden on the reader to access or interpret the information. For example:\n- Linking the reader to a giant .xlsx file from the Bureau of Labor Statistics isn\u2019t helpful. If the original source is convoluted, linking to an authoritative secondary source that summarizes the information is preferable.\nTo check the trustworthiness of a website, consider the following:\n- Who made the website and why? For example, if it\u2019s a website owned by a specialist, trade group, membership organization, or nonprofit, read the \u201cAbout Us\u201d page, if it\u2019s available. That page should be straightforward and should clearly explain the mission of the individual or organization.\n- Has the information been updated in the past few months?\n- Does the article link to other websites that are credible?\n- Are there any misspellings, broken links, or other errors or problems that affect the site\u2019s overall quality?\n- Check the mission, values, or agenda: Does the main purpose of the site appear to be to provide information, or is it promoting a specific point of view or trying to sell products? Some sites or organizations may have neutral or scientific-sounding names (such as the Infant Nutrition Council of America) but actually represent the interests of companies (in this example, formula companies).\n- Keep an eye out for red flags such as overly colorful or politically charged language.\n- Poke around for any other posts on the blog or site that might espouse values in opposition to ours.\nWhen referencing a scientific study:\n- Aim to use only peer-reviewed studies, those that are checked by other scientists. Note: Preprints are articles published online before they\u2019ve been peer-reviewed and, often, before they\u2019ve been submitted to a journal.\n- Link to the study, rather than to an article describing the study.\nEvaluating potential conflicts of interest of a source\nGenerally, \u201cconflict of interest\u201d refers to a source (someone interviewed, or whose work we cite) who might otherwise appear to be a neutral, independent party but is or was in a position to derive personal or professional benefit from what they are talking about, such as a company or product. The existence of a conflict of interest does not necessarily mean that the source is biased or \u201ctainted,\u201d that the source doesn\u2019t have good information that you can use in some way, or that the source is untrustworthy or dishonest. It does, however, open up Wirecutter\u2019s work to the perception of bias, which our journalists should avoid in every way possible.\nIf we aren\u2019t proactive and transparent about conflicts of interest, it could affect how our readers view the credibility of our sources and our reporting.\nHow to find out if a source has a conflict of interest:\n- The conflict of interest may be apparent simply in the source\u2019s job title (such as with PR representatives and company spokespeople, industry groups or consultants, salespeople, and store owners). In those cases, the nature of the source\u2019s relationship to the product or company they\u2019re talking about is usually evident in their attribution, and we don\u2019t need to dig any further or include extra disclosures.\n- Other conflicts of interest are less clear and need to be researched and, possibly, disclosed more directly. Sources in this category include brand ambassadors, researchers who have received grants or funding from companies whose products we\u2019re testing, experts who have patents used in the products they are talking about, experts who work as paid consultants for companies or industries, and experts who have websites with affiliate links for products they\u2019re talking about. In addition to reviewing these sources\u2019 professional background (past jobs and affiliations, LinkedIn profile, CV), directly ask them about conflicts of interest.\n- Sample wording: \u201cTo check whether we need to include any disclosures or clarifications in the article, could you let me know if you have any current or past financial ties to any of the products and companies we\u2019ve talked about? For example, patents, funding, or consultancy work?\u201d\nHow we disclose a conflict of interest depends on the degree of the conflict and how we plan to use the source. Wirecutter journalists should consult with their editor and/or the research and standards editor as soon as they find out about the conflict so that they can figure out how they\u2019ll use the source\u2019s information and how they\u2019ll disclose the conflict.\nOther types of sources that may have conflicts of interest:\n- Study authors: All reputable journals require that authors disclose any relevant conflicts of interest, real or perceived, and note significant sources of funding outside of their own institution\u2019s support (public or private grants, industry money, donations). Funding sources and conflicts of interest are typically reported at the end of scientific studies. This information is often not in the abstract; access and read the full study before deciding how to cite it. Finding the information may require contacting the authors of the study to ask whether their work was commissioned or funded by a company that stood to benefit from the research. This doesn\u2019t mean that all authors are disclosing all their sources of funding or potential conflicts, past and present. We still have to ask sources about their conflicts and do our own investigating.\n- Nonprofits, industry organizations, and advocacy groups: The names of organizations can be misleading. Check for parent companies and subsidiaries.\n- Newspapers and other media: Check if the outlet has a slant or position that could bias its reporting. And confirm that the sources the outlet used in its reporting don\u2019t have conflicts of interest\u2014these can be overlooked even in work by mainstream and otherwise trustworthy sources.\nVerifying our reporting\nReader trust is dependent on accurate reporting. Following our fact-checking guidelines, we scrutinize every article we publish to ensure that each fact has an authoritative source; that it is clear, logical, and consistent; that it meets our standards; and that the specific details are accurate.\nIncluding sources lists\nSources lists can help reinforce to readers our commitment to accurate reporting, and they enhance our credibility and transparency. We now limit sources lists to sources we interviewed; we no longer use this list to repeat mentions of articles, videos, websites, books, or other published items that we already mention and link to in the text. When you quote an unnamed company spokesperson, do not list them in the sources list.\nWe include a sources list in most articles for which we interviewed two or more sources.\nRecalls and safety alerts\nWhen we become aware of a recall or safety alert on a product in one of our guides, we add a note to the guide with the specific details, and we provide relevant links for readers to learn more about the recall. Be sure to run the language for this note by someone on the research team. Even if the product is not one of our picks, if it is within the category that the guide covers, we should note it; doing so alerts readers who may be using that recalled product, and the note provides a service by directing them to other options.\nBelow is our general process for pulling a pick due to a serious issue:\n- Notifying our readers is the top priority and should happen as soon as we have learned of the issue. Before a decision is made to pause (or pull) a pick recommendation, add a \"critical alert\" to all relevant guides and articles. The alert includes specific details about the event, any links for readers to learn more, and a note that we are aware of the issue and have reached out to the company for details.\n- Alert all relevant teams. This includes deals, social, research and standards, copy, production, and commerce. These teams should be updated throughout this process.\n- Once the alert has gone out and all teams have been notified, we should proceed thoughtfully and patiently to handle these subsequent steps (this timeline can take days or weeks). We should proceed to do reporting.\n- Reach out to the company and, if it makes sense, any experts or other sources that can help provide context.\n- Consider whether this is a repeat occurrence and how this potentially impacts our readers.\n- Decide on a course of action.\n- Discuss with relevant teams what rises to the level of removing the pick. As a general rule, however, any critical issue with one of our picks (a security breach a company has not adequately resolved, for example, or the potential for injury or death) should likely result in at least temporarily pulling that pick.\n- If this is a repeated occurrence, especially with respect to privacy and security breaches, we may consider pulling all picks across a brand, but the decision to pull picks across a brand and/or halt future testing should be discussed among relevant lead and top editors, edit leadership, and research and standards.\n- For consideration: Write an article explaining our decision. This may not be necessary under all circumstances, but when a longstanding or popular pick is removed, it may warrant a standalone explanation.\n- Begin by thoughtfully and accurately reporting the situation that resulted in our decision to stop recommending something.\n- While we will always act as advocates for the reader, we should be careful to frame our decisions in an actionable way without editorializing.\n- The reasoning behind our decision should be clear, logical, and consistent to readers.\n- Update all relevant guides with our reporting, and make sure picks are removed.\n- Continue to monitor the company, product, and situation. If the situation changes in the future, we may always decide to test and recommend the product(s) again.\nHonesty\nHonesty in how we represent ourselves and our work is fundamental to reader trust. When we\u2019re reporting, whenever possible we disclose that we are journalists to the people we cover, whether face to-face or otherwise. We never assert a false identity or affiliation or otherwise misrepresent ourselves.\nHowever, we need not always announce our status as journalists or reporters when seeking information normally available to the public, such as if we\u2019re representing ourselves as members of the general public for secret-shopper reporting on a company we\u2019re covering for an article.\nHow we present information\nWe don\u2019t plagiarize others\u2019 work. If we are including information verbatim from a source, we put quotation marks around it and give proper attribution so that the source is clear; this applies whether the quoted information appears within the text, in a caption, or as a pull quote. We link to articles and studies that we mention in our journalism.\nObeying the law while reporting\nWirecutter journalists must obey the law while performing work duties for Wirecutter, as defined by their local, regional, and national governmental bodies. They may not break into buildings, homes, apartments, or offices. They may not purloin data, documents, or other physical or electronic property, including but not limited to databases and email or voicemail messages. They may not tap telephones, invade computer files, or otherwise eavesdrop electronically on sources.\nDealing with competing publications\nWirecutter journalists compete zealously but deal with competing publications openly and honestly. We do not invent obstacles to hamstring their efforts. When we use facts reported by another publication or journalist, we attribute them. When working alongside competitors during industry events, Wirecutter journalists should endeavor to keep their work separate from those representing other publications. We may not accept payment from competitors for news tips.\nDefining \u201con the record\u201d and \u201coff the record\u201d\nWe do not record conversations without the prior consent of all parties to the conversations. Even where the law allows recording with only one party aware of it, the practice is a deception.\nIn the work that we do, there are relatively few legitimate instances in which a source has an excellent reason for being off the record, on background, or not for attribution. We always try to get sources on the record, and if we can\u2019t, we try to find another source.\n- If, at the top of the interview, we clearly identify ourselves as journalists and explain why we are reaching out to the source, everything they subsequently say is implicitly understood to be on the record. This means that we can use the information they provide, with no caveats, quoting the source by name.\n- All conversations are assumed to be on the record unless the source expressly requests\u2014and we explicitly agree\u2014to go off the record beforehand. \u201cOff the record\u201d means that the information a source provides cannot be used for publication and that the source cannot be named; such information is typically provided to give the journalist additional information or context. When a source says that a discussion is \u201coff the record\u201d:\n- It is critical to clearly talk through what that means and to agree on the definition. These rules must be agreed to at the outset of an interview. A source cannot say \u201cBy the way, that was all off the record\u201d at the end of a 30-minute interview; if they wish for the information to be off the record, they must ask for that before the interview.\n- If we can confirm the information with another source who doesn\u2019t insist on speaking off the record\u2014whether that means the source agreed to talking on the record, on background, or not for attribution\u2014we can publish it.\n- If a source says that something is \u201con background,\u201d we may use the information that the source gives us, but without attaching it to any mention or description of the source. We should try to verify the information elsewhere before publishing it.\n- If a source says that the information they have is \u201cnot for attribution,\u201d this means that we agree not to identify a source by name but in some cases can reference the source\u2019s job or position in general. That identification must be agreed upon by the journalist and the source, and it is almost always given in a way that prevents readers from discovering the source\u2019s identity.\nSensitivity and inclusivity\nTo best serve our readers and provide the most useful recommendations, we seek diverse voices and perspectives when we are testing and reporting. We approach our reporting with empathy for the breadth and depth of human experience, and we determine our picks based on diligent review of all the information at our disposal.\nOur articles aim to provide thoughtful, timely, and practical help to make buying decisions easier for everyone, not just one particular group.\nWe ensure that our testing and reporting practices meet our standards of inclusivity by regularly reviewing our journalism\u2014including articles already published\u2014and by utilizing and maintaining our database of research resources that provide access to and information about diverse sources.\nUsing diverse sources in testing and reporting about products\nWhen creating a test panel, we aim to find as diverse a sample as possible, whether it\u2019s finding people who wear a range of T-shirt sizes to test for the best one or using people who have various language-processing disorders and speak different dialects to determine the most effective dictation software.\nWhen we are determining whom to interview for a story, our goal is not only to find the most trustworthy and authoritative sources but also to seek sources who are representative of the people who are reading our articles. Some helpful questions to ask during reporting:\n- Are all of the sources white? Are all of them men? Are all of them able-bodied?\n- Are they in an ivory tower, or are some on the ground? Try to find a mix of both where possible.\n- Are all the sources in the same age group?\n- Do all of the sources live in coastal cities?\nIn making our asks of testers, however, make specific asks for testers of a particular identity only if it is pertinent to the item being tested, and be specific in your ask. For instance, for sunscreen testing across skin tones, seek volunteers based on specific skin tones you\u2019re looking for, as opposed to volunteers based on race. Or for testers of men\u2019s clothing, look for those who wear a particular size in men\u2019s clothing, rather than testers of a certain gender.\nWriting about people\nWe strive to use accurate, sensitive, and up-to-date language when talking about individuals and groups of people. This can include how we refer to people belonging to different ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, or other demographic groups; people with disabilities or medical conditions; people\u2019s gender and orientation; and people\u2019s size or appearance.\nThere is no single source that covers the best practices for all groups and people. Wirecutter journalists should refer to our editorial style guide, consult with their editor and with the copy edit team, and use these additional resources for guidance:\nNew York Times Stylebook\nNational Center on Disability and Journalism Style Guide\nNational Association of Black Journalists Style Guide\nThe Association of LGBTQ Journalists Style Guide\nTrans Journalists Association Style Guide\nAvoiding assumptions and generalizations about people\nWe are careful to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people, including our readers, but assumptions can easily slip into a description of a product. We should consistently examine our journalism for blanket statements and stereotypes. For example:\nBlanket statements about people based on age or gender are unhelpful generalizations:\n- \u201cThe smart blood pressure monitor\u2019s extra features may be confusing for elderly people.\u201d\n- \u201cWomen may find this backpack too wide in the shoulders.\u201d\nThere are rare exceptions, but in general feminine and masculine are vague terms that rely on stereotypes to stand in for accurate description. Try to avoid using feminine or masculine, or gender neutral, to describe people or things.\nBeing specific\nWe use nonjudgmental, inclusive language that does not designate what is normal and abnormal. Our testing panels are not necessarily representative of all people, and typically they are not large enough for us to draw sweeping conclusions.\nWherever possible, and with the consent of testing-panel members, we try to be as specific as possible about our testers and indicate how that information might be relevant to our readers. For example, instead of saying \u201cif you\u2019re smaller, this backpack might be too large,\u201d we should say something like, \u201cif you\u2019re under 5-foot-3, this backpack might be too large.\u201d\nUsing minors as sources\nBefore interviewing a minor or using a minor in one of our testing panels, always get a parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission. And be cautious about including identifying details; for example, use only their first name when referring to them in an article, if you use their name at all.\nProfanity and offensive language\nIdeas about what is offensive are constantly evolving, but in general we try to avoid profanity in our articles. The editorial style guide has general rules for this, but writers should consult with their editor if they\u2019re unsure what\u2019s appropriate to include.\nTransparency\nTransparency about our journalistic processes is essential to maintaining reader trust. Wirecutter journalists are open about the methods they use in reporting, take ownership of their journalism, and are accountable for errors.\nBylines and reporting credits\nWriters of an article receive a byline, unless the article is generally from Wirecutter staff, in which case the byline reads \u201cWirecutter Staff.\u201d Most articles should have no more than two bylines. A reporter who contributed to the article may get a \u201ccontributed reporting\u201d credit at the end.\nEditors of an article are also credited at the end. Naming the editors increases transparency about who worked on the article and reinforces to readers the work that goes into publishing our reporting.\nFor rewritten articles, we use the following guidelines: The first time an article is rewritten by a different writer, we move the original byline and give them credit at the end of the article. (The editor should confirm, if possible, whether the original bylined writer wants to be credited.) In the spirit of a rewrite, we encourage the new writer to complete new reporting. When a writer has been assigned to rewrite an article but ultimately preserves two-thirds or more of the original work, the writer gets an additional-reporting attribution at the end of the article rather than a new byline.\nOnly editors of the current article are credited at the end.\nTimestamps and notes\nOutdated information is not helpful to readers. To make sure our published work provides service to readers with the most up-to-date and accurate information, we periodically review it, and we update it or rewrite it where necessary.\nWe update the timestamp when we have reviewed an article and made minor edits to the introduction, or made behind-the-scenes changes, such as adding images or a bulleted list to a section.\nWe both update the timestamp and add a note when we want to make readers aware of essential information and updates to an article, such as new-pick announcements, upcoming product testing, or timely and important news, such as product recalls.\nRevealing our process\nWirecutter journalism is distinguished by the ways in which our journalists demonstrate the work that goes into finding our recommendations. The \u201cHow we picked,\u201d \u201cHow we tested,\u201d and \u201cWhy you should trust us\u201d sections in our guides explain our methods and highlight the expertise (our own and that of our sources) informing our reporting.\nWe also publish articles about our standards, such as how we vet sources. These articles underscore our commitment to readers to be the most trusted product-recommendation service.\nAnonymous sources\nWe have an extremely high bar for using anonymous or pseudonymous sources. Readers have a right to know where information and insight are coming from. We do not allow a source to be anonymous or to use a pseudonym just because they prefer to. There has to be a very good and compelling reason that anonymity is critical for, say, the source\u2019s personal safety. And even in such a case, our likely path would be to find a different source.\nWe can make allowances for nicknames or preferred names, such as Davey instead of David, but we cannot obscure a source\u2019s identity.\nThe same rules do not apply for a \u201cdead name\u201d that might appear on a person\u2019s birth certificate (for example, we would only ever refer to Caitlyn Jenner).\nCorrections and clarifications\nWirecutter journalists make every effort to ensure the accuracy of everything we publish, but mistakes can happen. We take corrections seriously, and we endeavor to fix all errors and address all requests for clarification as swiftly as possible. Below are our policies on handling corrections and clarifications:\n- When we encounter a factual error in our reporting, we update the article with the correct information and a note titled \u201cCorrection\u201d addressing the error and how we have corrected it.\n- If a source alerts us to the error, we respond immediately, informing them that we will look into the error and follow up with them. The writer, the editor, and the research team discuss the error and examine the reporting and sourcing. If we determine that there is indeed an error that needs correcting, we issue a correction and follow up with the source to let them know.\n- If a source or a company mentioned in an article contacts us and asks for a clarification, and the clarification would increase the accuracy of the article, the writer and the editor (and research) discuss how to incorporate that information.\n- If a source or company requests the addition of information\u2014for example, incorporating a link to a particular page on the source\u2019s or company\u2019s website\u2014it is at the discretion of the editor (in consultation with research) whether to add that information.\nImpartiality\nWe ensure our impartiality by being mindful of how we represent ourselves when appearing to the public, including online.\nWirecutter journalists have a duty to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. We should never invoke Wirecutter\u2019s name or The New York Times\u2019s name in private activities. We should protect our reputation for fairness by being cautious about expressing political opinions or points of view that may be interpreted as representative of the company as a whole, and we must be vigilant against any appearance that we\u2019re abusing nonpublic information for financial gain. And we should never disclose confidential information about our operations, policies, or plans.\nThis policy extends to relatives and close friends. Wirecutter journalists should discuss with their supervisor any situation that involves a potential for conflict of interest or a threat to the organization\u2019s reputation in the activities of a spouse, partner, relative, or close personal friend; such situations could include, for example, a spouse\u2019s job, political activities, or business relations. In some cases, disclosure is enough. But if Wirecutter considers the problem to be serious, the staffer may have to withdraw from certain coverage, and sometimes an assignment may have to be modified or a beat changed.\nThis policy does not bar us from responding openly and honestly to any reasonable inquiry from a reader about our work. If a reader asks for a correction or clarification, we should give that request careful and thoughtful review.\nRepresenting Wirecutter and The New York Times in public\nWirecutter journalists cannot collaborate in ventures involving organizations that figure or are likely to figure in coverage they provide, edit, package, or supervise. Examples include collaborating in writing books, pamphlets, reports, scripts, scores, or any other material, and in making photographs or creating artwork of any sort.\nExcept in reviews or columns published by Wirecutter, The New York Times, or other Times properties, or appropriately voiced in public appearances authorized by the editor-in-chief, Wirecutter journalists may not represent Wirecutter in offering endorsements, testimonials, or promotional blurbs for books, films, television programs, or any other programs, products, or ventures.\nThey may not serve on government boards or commissions, paid or unpaid. They generally may not join boards of trustees, advisory committees, or similar groups except those serving journalistic organizations (or otherwise promoting journalism education), houses of worship, community charities, local libraries, fine-arts groups, hobby groups, youth athletic leagues, country clubs, and alumni groups. Depending on the circumstances, exceptions may be made to permit Wirecutter journalists to serve their alma mater (or their children\u2019s alma mater) as a trustee or visitor at schools that seldom if ever generate news of interest to Wirecutter.\nWirecutter journalists may not solicit funds for organizations that operate political campaigns for local, state, or federal office or that participate in lobbying activities as a substantial part of their total activities.\nSpeaking engagements and other media appearances\nOutside appearances can enhance the reputation of our bylines and serve our interests. Nevertheless, no Wirecutter journalist may appear before an outside group if the appearance could reasonably create an actual or apparent conflict of interest or undermine public trust in our impartiality. Wirecutter journalists should be especially sensitive to the appearance of partiality when they address groups that might figure in coverage they provide, edit, or supervise, especially if the setting might suggest a close relationship to the sponsoring group.\nWirecutter journalists must always discuss speaking engagements, including appearances related to promoting a book they\u2019ve written, and extensive speaking schedules with their supervisors. Furthermore, speeches and other outside endeavors, paid or unpaid, should not imply that they carry the endorsement of Wirecutter or The New York Times (unless they do); to the contrary, they should gracefully remind the audience that the views expressed are their own.\nRegarding payment related to speaking engagements:\n- Wirecutter journalists who write books that derive from their assignment or beat and who want to promote them may accept fees for promotional appearances but must make every effort to ensure that their appearances conform to the spirit of these guidelines and do not interfere with their job responsibilities.\n- Wirecutter journalists may accept speaking fees, honorariums, expense reimbursement, and free transportation only from educational or other nonprofit groups for which lobbying and political activity are not a major focus.\nBook projects\nAny Wirecutter journalist intending to write or assemble a nonfiction book based on material that derives from their assignment or beat must seek permission from Wirecutter in advance.\nIn contemplating book projects\u2014or other outside endeavors\u2014that derive from their assignment or beat, Wirecutter journalists must never give an impression that they might benefit financially from the outcome of news events. They may not negotiate with any outside person or entity for any rights to an article or story idea before the article has run in Wirecutter.\nBook projects that don\u2019t derive from their assignment or beat must comply with our freelancing policy. At no time may a Wirecutter journalist turn over notes, interviews, documents, or other working materials that derive from their assignment or beat to any third party, including agents, producers, studios, or outside production agencies, or share those materials with them unless authorized to do so by the editor-in-chief or legally compelled to do so.\nProviding financial or other advice\nIt is an inherent conflict for Wirecutter journalists to perform public relations work, paid or unpaid. They should not take part in public relations workshops that charge admission or imply privileged access to Wirecutter or Times people, or participate in surveys asking their opinion of an organization\u2019s press relations or public image. They are free, however, to offer reasonable help to institutions such as their child\u2019s school, a small museum, a community charity, or their house of worship.\nAvoiding financial conflicts of interest\nWe must be constantly vigilant against any appearance that we are abusing nonpublic information for financial gain. Any Wirecutter journalist, regardless of assignment, is free to own diversified mutual funds, money market funds, and other diversified investments that they cannot control. They also may own treasury bills, investment-grade municipal bonds, debt securities other than speculative bonds, and securities issued by The New York Times. And they are of course free to own stocks entirely unrelated to their Wirecutter assignment.\nNo Wirecutter journalist may own stock or have any other financial interest in a company, enterprise, or industry that figures or is likely to figure in coverage that they provide, edit, package, or supervise regularly, other than stated in the previous paragraph. For this purpose, an industry is defined broadly; for example, a Wirecutter journalist responsible for any segment of covering electronics may not own any stock in electronics companies.\nWirecutter journalists may not buy or sell securities or make other investments in anticipation of forthcoming articles.\nIf they own stock in a company outside their regular beat and are assigned to write or edit an article about that company or its industry, they must discuss the investment with their assigning editor before beginning the work. In many instances it will be perfectly permissible for the work to proceed, but they may not buy or sell stock in the company or industry until two weeks after the article\u2019s publication.\nA Wirecutter journalist who owns stock and moves into an assignment where such holdings are not permitted must sell the stock. For instance, it is manifestly untenable for a new electronics editor to own stock in an electronics company, so the divestiture must be prompt.\nIndependence\nConflicts of interest can undermine trust in our reporting. To ensure the integrity of our coverage, we reduce the potential for bias by exercising independent editorial judgment, and we maintain our neutrality through careful consideration of our interactions and relationships with the people and companies we encounter through our reporting.\nSometimes conflicts are unavoidable, and when they arise, we evaluate them with the goal of finding an honest and transparent resolution of that conflict.\nPolicy on affiliate revenue\nOur business makes its money primarily through affiliate revenue. This means that if people trust our recommendations, and if they then purchase\u2014and keep\u2014the things we review, we make money. But if they return bad products, we make nothing. That\u2019s why reader trust is paramount. Without it, we have no business.\nTo maintain editorial integrity, detailed information regarding our revenue is not shared with our newsroom. We never want editorial employees\u2019 decisions on what picks to make to be influenced by how much money a product brings Wirecutter in affiliate revenue. We never want to be perceived as choosing a pick for any reason other than our editorial evaluation of its quality. Wirecutter journalists will never be asked to take part in influencing business partners. The business side handles all conversations about partnership or affiliate revenue. Wirecutter journalists may speak with PR people and product managers, but any discussions about business, partnerships, licensing, or affiliate revenue should be handled only by the business team.\nAdvertising\nWirecutter journalists will never be asked to participate in the direct creation of advertiser marketing copy or advertorials, excepting those promoting Wirecutter or The New York Times. If an advertiser or licensee asks to have us review a product, we will do so only through our standard editorial vetting process, which makes sure that products meet our requirements for testing and review.\nInteracting with publicists and press releases\nPublicists help us find and build relationships with sources and help us learn more about how a product or service works. We work with them to ask for samples for testing, to learn more about how products are manufactured, and to ask companies hard questions. But our news agenda is not dictated by any publicist\u2019s agenda. We do not take a company\u2019s words at face value or parrot its claims with the assumption that they\u2019re true. We approach every product and service with careful analysis and healthy skepticism. With that in mind:\n- Be aware of what a PR person or company isn\u2019t saying. Just as an editor is editing as much for what isn\u2019t on the page as what is, Wirecutter journalists should look at a press release and wonder what\u2019s being left out. For example, a company is unlikely to mention if the FDA has concerns about the product\u2019s safety.\n- Interview experts to see if a company\u2019s claims are even possible. And if they are possible, ask whether the described features or benefits are safe, especially in the health realm.\n- Report only what we actually know to be true. If a company\u2019s press release claims that a battery lasts 10 years, all we know is \u201cthe company claims that its battery lasts 10 years,\u201d not \u201cthis battery lasts 10 years.\u201d\n- Make it very clear which claims in an article are from our independent reporting, and which claims originated from the company.\nNDAs and embargoes\nIf a company asks us to agree to an embargo for news or upcoming information, we will agree to that embargo verbally or via email. However, if a company needs something more formal or is asking for a signature on a legally binding NDA (non-disclosure agreement), only authorized signers are allowed to enter into those types of contracts on behalf of Wirecutter.\nPolicies on products we test\nTo maintain our editorial independence, we do not keep unsolicited or free products, and we do not keep test products except for long-term testing. Our product orders and testing guidelines outline how to return or donate products.\nFor products we\u2019ve tested:\n- Any test products that we have not chosen as a pick should be returned to the companies that lent them to us as soon as possible after the completion of the guide. If the company does not want the product returned, we should donate it.\n- If a product has been chosen as a pick, the guide\u2019s editor may elect to allow the writer or another staffer to keep the product for long-term testing for as long as it remains the pick. When we replace the pick, and we no longer need the product for long-term testing, we should return the product to the manufacturer or donate it.\nFor defective or dismissed products:\n- If we dismiss a product prior to testing for reasons that are either well documented in customer reviews or obvious (such as too high a price), contacting the manufacturer for comment is not necessary.\n- If we test a product and find that it does not meet our expectations or it appears to be defective, or if it is one of only a few items that don\u2019t meet expectations, writers or editors are expected to reach out to the manufacturer for comment. If the manufacturer does not respond within a reasonable amount of time as determined by the editor, say so in the text. This step adds time to the process but girds our findings against criticism.\n- We may also take the additional step of calling in or buying a duplicate item to retest. The decision regarding how to retest the product should be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\nHow we compensate experts and testers\nFor most guides, we do not compensate experts who speak with us on the record. Occasionally, we may collaborate with labs or experts as consultants to work with us on testing. Wirecutter journalists should consult with their editor before agreeing to work with outside labs or consultants\u2014and whether compensation is involved or not, we should have a written agreement outlining the terms of the work.\nWhen we conduct test panels, we may choose to compensate participants, but we determine this on a case-by-case basis. Wirecutter journalists always disclose whether testers in their guides were paid.\nSharing our journalism with sources\nUnless we are under exceptional circumstances\u2014and we have approval from edit leadership\u2014we do not share our work with sources before it is published. And we do not allow sources to change what they said on the record or dictate how we report a topic. We verify factual information from sources according to our fact-checking guidelines, using interview backup (transcripts, articles, and the like). If we need to reach out to a source to clarify a quote, we paraphrase the quote rather than reading it back verbatim.\nRelationships with sources\nRelationships with sources require the utmost in sound judgment and self-discipline to prevent the fact or appearance of partiality. Cultivating sources is an essential skill, often practiced most effectively in informal settings outside of normal business hours. Yet Wirecutter journalists, especially those assigned to beats, must remain aware that personal relationships with sources can erode into favoritism, in fact or appearance. And conversely we must remain aware that sources are eager to win our goodwill for reasons of their own.\nEven though this topic defies hard-and-fast rules, it is essential that we preserve a professional detachment to cultivate an unbiased relationship. Though informal communication is permitted, we should be mindful of the difference between social and business engagement. For example, we may see sources informally over a meal or drinks, but scrupulous practice requires that periodically we step back and take a hard look at whether we have drifted too close to sources we deal with regularly.\nThose who develop romantic, partnered, or other close personal relationships with people who might figure in coverage they provide, edit, package, or supervise must disclose those relationships to their manager. Further action will be determined based on the impact on their main work and any conflict of interest that may arise when they are covering the subject of their partner\u2019s or close friend\u2019s work. Such action may include, in certain cases, recusing themselves from certain coverage or modifying assignments or beats.\nThe legitimate activities of companions, spouses, and relatives can sometimes create journalistic conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts. They can crop up in civic or political life, professional pursuits, and financial activity. A brother or a daughter working at Whirlpool, for instance, might produce the appearance of conflict for an appliance writer or editor.\nTo avoid such conflicts, Wirecutter journalists may not write or edit coverage about companies for which their family members, partners, or close personal friends have involvement. Such individuals are allowed to contribute to product testing or modeling for photos. However, in the interest of transparency, such relationships should be disclosed within the article. Anyone who isn't sure should ask their editor or supervisor for guidance.\nAccepting hospitality from companies and sources\nWe pay our own expenses when we travel for work. In some business situations and in some cultures, accepting a meal or a drink paid for by a source may be unavoidable. For example, a Wirecutter journalist need not decline every invitation to speak to a manufacturer or source over lunch in the corporation\u2019s private dining room, where it is all but impossible to pick up the check. Whenever practical, however, they should suggest dining where Wirecutter can pay.\nWirecutter journalists may not accept free or discounted transportation and lodging except where special circumstances give us little or no choice. Among those circumstances are certain scientific expeditions and other trips for which alternative arrangements would be impractical (for example, group press buses that move people from one end of the conference to the other during the CES trade show). Wirecutter journalists should consult their supervisors and/or the editor-in-chief when special circumstances or questions arise.\nAccepting gifts and discounts\nAny goods sent as gifts should be politely declined and either sent back or donated. We do not accept gifts from the manufacturers, retailers, or public relations firms with which we work. (This policy does not include promotional items distributed to all attendees at trade shows and conferences.) Accepting such gifts imperils the integrity of our coverage. Politely decline and return the gift to the sender, or in the event that the sender refuses to take the gift back, donate it via coordination with our operations team and obtain a receipt.\nWirecutter journalists may accept any gifts or discounts available to the general public. Normally they are also free to take advantage of conventional corporate discounts, free admission at museums, or other benefits extended to all employees by virtue of The Times Company Foundation\u2019s support of various cultural institutions.\nWe must be mindful, however, that significant discounts\u2014excluding those that The Times has negotiated for employees\u2014can connote partiality. Those who have a hand in the coverage of the company or industry offering the discount should consult their supervisor if they have concerns about maintaining impartiality in light of discounts.\nUnless the special terms are offered by The Times or a Times subsidiary or affiliate, Wirecutter journalists may not buy stock in initial public offerings through \u201cfriends and family shares\u201d where any plausible possibility exists of a real or apparent conflict of interest. They may not accept allocations from brokerage firms.\nCompetitions and contests\nWirecutter journalists may not enter competitions sponsored by individuals or groups who have a direct interest in the tenor of our coverage. They may not act as judges for these competitions or accept their awards. Common examples are contests sponsored by commercial, political, or professional associations to judge coverage of their affairs. The editor-in-chief may make exceptions for competitions underwritten by corporate sponsors if they are broad in scope and independently judged.\nWirecutter journalists may compete in competitions sponsored by groups whose members are all journalists or whose members demonstrably have no direct interest in the tenor of coverage of the field being judged. They may act as judges for such competitions and accept their awards. For example, a Wirecutter journalist may enter a university-sponsored competition for coverage of environmental consumer products but may not accept an advocacy group\u2019s prize for outstanding environmental coverage.\nWirecutter journalists are free to accept honorary degrees, medals, and other awards from colleges, universities, and other educational institutions; however, unsought awards from groups that do not meet the criteria established here should be declined politely.\nAccessibility\nReaders who come to us for advice related to disability and aging in place are generally either seeking solutions to a chronic need or responding to a sudden change in their or their loved ones\u2019 lives, such as a fall, onset of dementia, or another change in their ability to care for themselves. Shopping for accessibility needs can be a frustrating, expensive, and overwhelming experience.\nWe can serve our readers best by approaching their needs with compassion, prioritizing dignity and clarity, and providing thorough research and context to back up everything we say. We should be thoughtful and intentional in how we direct our advice and to whom. For these readers in particular, it is especially important not to assume that the decision-makers are exclusively the caregivers and not the disabled, chronically ill, or older people. Our work should also demonstrate awareness of other factors that may be at play in our readers\u2019 lives, such as multiple disabilities or health conditions, income level, geographic location, level of family support, and cultural differences.\nOur accessibility and aging in place editor helps ensure that our reporting adheres to our criteria for best serving these readers whether we\u2019re reporting for a standalone article or within the context of a guide or blog post.\nSustainability\nThe goal of our sustainability coverage is to help readers understand the trade-offs between product performance, price, accessibility, and environmental impact. Never judgmental or flippant, we engage with reader questions and concerns surrounding the environmental and health impacts of buying and using a product, transparently share what we know and what we don\u2019t, and provide actionable advice to readers. We aim to be direct, contextual, pragmatic, and, above all, accurate. We do not perpetuate myths or greenwashing terms.\nPrivacy and security\nPrivacy is complicated. Privacy is equal parts the ethics of the individual, the priorities of society, and corporate responsibility. It\u2019s our job to explain those issues and provide readers with the tools to understand the privacy implications of any products we review both on a personal level and on a broader level. With privacy, we\u2019re here to predict what questions a reader might have and try to answer them before they ask.\nThough security and privacy often go hand in hand, they are very different concerns. Security applies to how data is handled and whether it\u2019s kept secure both on a device and online. It also applies to any private data stored, such as health data, financial information, a Social Security number, and anything else that easily identifies a person. With security coverage, our goal is to outline best practices and to hold most companies to the same standards, though the level of security necessary is also related to the data involved. (For example: A camera in a house should have more security protections than, say, a smart toothbrush.)\nSocial Media\nIt\u2019s imperative that we are smart and thoughtful in our social media use, and that we think before we post. Social media is an umbrella term for a variety of online forms of communication, including but not limited to text, video, audio, and pictures published on services such as Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter), Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, blogs, internet forums, and message boards. Just as in the real world, we may be perceived as a representative of The New York Times when speaking publicly.\nThe following should serve as a guide to help Wirecutter journalists identify and avoid potential pitfalls when using social media:\n- Be mindful when commenting on colleagues\u2019 or other publications\u2019 activities, employees, or work, including, for example, that of The New York Times. Avoid insulting or making fun of other review publications and their employees.\n- Be courteous to our readers, even when we think they are wrong. Respond to criticism of our work constructively, or pass it to our community team to respond to.\n- If readers or people from other publications ask questions about our business model, affiliate relationships, how we make money, who we\u2019re partnering with, and the like, we should not answer directly. Bring those questions to the attention of your manager or editor-in-chief, or direct them to the appropriate page on our website.\n- The standards of behavior as established in The New York Times\u2019s anti-harassment policy apply equally online as they do in the physical workplace.\n- As stated in the Mission and Values statement of The New York Times, the trust of our readers is essential. We renew that trust every day through the actions and judgment of all our employees\u2014in our journalism, in our workplace, and in public. To that end, it is essential that each of us protects The New York Times\u2019s independence by communicating in ways that reinforce our role as journalists. Fair or not, we are perceived as representatives of Wirecutter and The New York Times when we speak publicly, and at all times we should ensure that we are representing ourselves and our group in a manner that does not undercut The New York Times\u2019s and Wirecutter\u2019s journalistic reputation. This includes being mindful of expressing partisan opinions or promoting political views in public.\n- Do not pass the work of others off as our own. Respect the laws regarding copyrights and trademarks. Provide links, @-mentions (or the equivalent), or other attribution when citing or referring to sources of information.\n- We may not infringe on Wirecutter\u2019s or The New York Times\u2019s logos, brand names, slogans, or other trademarks.\n- If we\u2019re using social media to raise funds for charity or a cause, avoid any appearance that Wirecutter or The New York Times endorses this effort.\n- Feel free to answer reader questions or help people on social media. That\u2019s the core of what we do as a publication, and we pride ourselves in being helpful on all mediums, even if it\u2019s not on our site. Remember that our expert community team can also help field reader questions!\n- Overall: Try to be wise and to approach social media with the helpful but respectfully direct mindset that we would take on our site and in our workplace. If we wouldn\u2019t say something on our website, on Slack, or directly to someone\u2019s face in person, we probably shouldn\u2019t post it on social media, either.\nFreelancers\nConflicts of interest for our freelance writers\nOur readers apply exacting standards to the entire publication. They do not distinguish between staff-written articles and those written by outsiders. Thus, as far as possible, freelance contributors, while not employees of Wirecutter, are held to the same reporting and ethical standards as staff members when they are on Wirecutter assignments. If they violate these guidelines, they will be denied further assignments.\nWhen we hire freelance writers, we should confirm that they do not have significant financial relationships with companies that would threaten their ability to be impartial in their reporting. For example, some personal finance writers and influencers have brand deals in which credit card companies pay for branded content, or certain beauty writers may have received gifts or money in exchange for social media posts. We should avoid using the services of anyone who falls into this category."

      "text": "The Best Suitcases for Checking\nFor many travelers, the frequently discussed dream is to never check a bag. But life doesn\u2019t always cooperate\u2014sometimes you need a bigger suitcase.\nAfter researching 31 pieces of checked luggage and testing eight finalists over many years, we can still say that the Travelpro Platinum Elite 25\u2033 Expandable Spinner is the best suitcase for most travelers who plan to check a bag.\nThe bag easily holds two weeks\u2019 worth of clothes, and it looks and feels fantastic. And it comes with a limited lifetime warranty against airline damage.\nTesting takeaways\n- More-reliable specs\nWe\u2019ve found that the stated dimensions and weights of checked suitcases tend to be more accurate than those of their carry-on counterparts.\n- Better over bumps\nWheel quality can affect how well carry-ons roll, but this is less true for checked bags\u2014their weight smooths out the ride.\n- Less need for Tetris\nHandle shape and size often dictate a carry-on\u2019s usable space. In roomier, checked bags, however, they\u2019re less of a factor.\n- What else matters?\nWe considered how well a suitcase handles when it\u2019s fully packed, how durable its materials are, and whether it\u2019s comfortable to use.\nThe Travelpro Platinum Elite 25\u2033 Expandable Spinner is the larger, checked-luggage version of our Travelpro carry-on top pick, and everything we like about its diminutive sibling applies again here.\nIt\u2019s made of a hard-wearing nylon that\u2019s both sleek and durable. And it looks and feels like a bag that costs a lot more than it actually does.\nFor a checked bag, it\u2019s also surprisingly nimble. That\u2019s thanks to the height-adjustable handle and the magnetically locking MagnaTrac wheels, which make the bag noticeably easier to maneuver\u2014especially when it\u2019s loaded with 50 pounds of stuff. And this suitcase is protected by a lifetime warranty, with stated protections against airline damages.\nInternally, the Platinum Elite is well organized, and it includes a built-in garment folder for formalwear, with a removable folding board (similar to the one in our upgrade pick). If you need a little more space, consider the Travelpro Platinum Elite 29\u2033 Expandable Spinner.\nNote that with luggage this capacious, it\u2019s easy to overpack and exceed the 50-pound (22-kilogram) weight limit imposed by most airlines. But if you\u2019re willing to pay the fee, the Platinum Elite can easily withstand the extra weight.\nFor anyone who enjoys the look and simplicity of hard-sided luggage\u2014as well as the comfort of knowing that this one is virtually impossible to overpack\u2014The Medium suitcase from Away is an excellent choice with an excellent warranty.\nSoft-sided luggage typically has a longer lifespan than hard-sided bags, typically made of ABS plastic or polycarbonate. And soft-sided luggage typically has features like exterior pockets, making organization easier. However, the differences in durability and utility between hard- and soft-sided luggage are increasingly marginal, and plenty of people prefer the aesthetic and additional color options of polycarbonate suitcases.\nAway builds its luggage with high-quality components. We tested the Away bag for three years before first recommending it. This suitcase has been our pick for over six years now, and we are confident in its long-term durability and the reputation of Away\u2019s limited lifetime warranty. Away also makes a bigger checked-luggage model, The Large. We\u2019ve found, however, that it\u2019s very easy to overpack suitcases of this size, even ones that are hard-sided.\nIf you identify as a frequent flier or a serious overpacker, or if you have a large family and are willing to invest in higher-quality luggage for traveling, we recommend the Briggs & Riley Baseline Medium Expandable 25\u2033 Spinner.\nAlthough the Travelpro Platinum Elite is great for the price, the Briggs & Riley Baseline bag is great, period. Every detail is made to the highest standards of any luggage maker\u2014from the zippers to the wheels to a unique compression system (which lets you fit an additional week\u2019s worth of clothing into the same volume as offered by the Travelpro bag).\nYou won\u2019t get the unique styling that other luxury brands specialize in, but Briggs & Riley\u2019s reputation for reliability and durability is unmatched. The bag also includes a garment folder, as the Travelpro bag does.\nIf things go awry, user-replaceable parts and a network of repair centers located around the world make quick fixes easy, and the reliable lifetime warranty covers repairs for any kind of damage. We\u2019ve traveled with this durable bag for six years now on multiple national and international trips. And it\u2019s still in great shape and a dream to pack. Also, its expanding capability has rescued us more than once when we wanted to bring something extra home.\nTrunk luggage, including the Monos Hybrid Trunk, replaces the 50/50 split of a clamshell design with a deeper central compartment. It\u2019s a small change, and it makes packing this type of case very pleasant.\nHowever, this luggage seems best for destination travel, when you pack up once and unpack once. Living out of a trunk requires more layers of packing and unpacking. So using trunk luggage across multiple stops could seem potentially onerous, compared with using a bag that has a typical clamshell design. Also, at least one traveler we know was dinged with an oversize fee for their Hybrid Trunk.\nMonos continues to impress us with its luggage lines and construction. But the Hybrid Trunk stands out for its reinforced aluminum frame and denser-feeling polycarbonate, and it has a lifetime warranty for any damage that renders the luggage unusable.\nThe research\n- Why you should trust us\n- How we picked and tested\n- Top pick for checked luggage: Travelpro Platinum Elite 25\" Expandable Spinner\n- Top pick for hard-sided luggage: Away The Medium Suitcase\n- Upgrade pick: Briggs & Riley Baseline Expandable Spinner\n- Best suitcase for trunk lovers: Monos Hybrid Trunk\n- Other suitcases worth considering\n- The competition\nWhy you should trust us\nI\u2019ve been covering luggage and travel-bag design for Wirecutter for nearly a decade, and I have personally researched, tested, and compared hundreds of bags in that time.\n- Over nearly a decade, I\u2019ve spent more than 160 hours researching luggage, continually testing to understand what makes good luggage.\n- Over the years, we\u2019ve also spoken with plenty of experts: flight attendants for major airlines; product designers and creative directors for luggage and gear companies; and travel writers. My conversations with these people have helped shape our coverage, and we owe much to their collective knowledge.\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nHow we picked and tested\nIn the near-decade that we\u2019ve covered this category, the products have evolved\u2014and so has our thinking about what kind of luggage is best for most people. Based on what\u2019s available and what different travelers prefer, we think the following travel bags are the best checked luggage you can currently find.\nThere may be thousands of different types of checked luggage available for sale. Even after we excluded models that didn\u2019t meet our basic criteria\u2014a reliable warranty, reputable luggage reviews, and quality materials\u2014we found hundreds of bags worth testing. And we went on to evaluate the choices between nylon and polyester, the difference in wheel-bearing designs, why alloys in telescoping handles matter, and more.\nBesides the suggestions from our experts, we researched editorial and user reviews of luggage, making sure to include popular brands, such as Samsonite and Tumi, as well as more-esoteric names, like Hideo Wakamatsu. In addition to our interviews with experts, we\u2019ve spoken with assorted salespeople, brand engineers, and media-relations folks, to make sure we found the best models from each company.\nIf you want a general rundown of our testing process, check out the corresponding sections from our best carry-on luggage review, since our testing of the larger bags mirrored that process. But we did uncover some differences\u2014mostly having to do with the larger size of checked luggage\u2014that led us to modify our analysis.\nThe smaller the luggage, the more intricate the design must become to accommodate travelers\u2019 needs. While testing carry-on luggage in the past, we found that company claims of luggage weight and measurements weren\u2019t exactly precise, with capacities exaggerated and weights minimized. Oddly, for checked bags, we didn\u2019t find so much fudging of the numbers. Our best guess is that with the looser size and weight restrictions for checked luggage, manufacturers aren\u2019t as motivated to manipulate their figures when advertising their larger bags.\nWhen we tested carry-ons, we noticed the varied and individual way that each bag handled rough surfaces, depending on their wheels and build quality. With checked bags, this wasn\u2019t a problem. When any checked bag was fully packed, the weight carried it over the roughest of surfaces, without a strong discernable difference between models.\nWith bags this large, the subtler points of comparison aren\u2019t as pronounced. For instance, the handle\u2019s size and shape can significantly change a carry-on bag\u2019s usable space and your overall packing experience. But when space limits aren\u2019t an issue, this doesn\u2019t really matter. As a result, we focused on the obvious design comparisons, including how these bags handled when full, how durable their materials were, and whether the bags were comfortable to use.\nTop pick for checked luggage: Travelpro Platinum Elite 25\" Expandable Spinner\nFor the majority of families who fly less than 25,000 miles a year together, the Travelpro Platinum Elite 25\u2033 Expandable Spinner is the best choice for checked luggage.\nIt\u2019s the bag to compare others against. The Platinum Elite suitcase is a durable, attractively styled, well-organized bag for a reasonable price. It holds a full seven days\u2019 worth of clothes for two people, and it\u2019s protected by a warranty that covers carrier damage, as long as you register the bag within 120 days of purchase. (The registration is a very simple process, and it can be done in 5 minutes with a smartphone: Simply take a picture of the registration code, which comes with the luggage; send that picture to a number Travelpro provides; and fill out the form in the response link.)\nDuring a trip to New Zealand, our tester was able to pack two weeks\u2019 worth of clothes\u2014without a laundry stop\u2014and several pieces of camera equipment into the Platinum Magna (the previous, largely identical model of the Platinum Elite) without issue. Like every large piece of checked luggage we tested, the Platinum Elite comes only in a four-wheel (or \u201cspinner\u201d) configuration. More wheels mean more bits with the potential to break (as well as some reduction of interior space), but that\u2019s a necessary compromise for bags this size, if you want any hope of managing them in a busy airport.\nIt shrugs off wear and tear. The Platinum Elite\u2019s exterior is made of ballistic nylon, which can take more overall abuse than polycarbonate and will show less wear in the long run. As we\u2019ve said with regard to carry-ons, we don\u2019t think polycarbonate hard-shell bags are as versatile or durable as soft-sided nylon bags. (Travelpro tests its bags by filling them with 70-pound loads and passing each handle through 7,500 automated lift tests.)\nHard-shell bags usually weigh about 4 pounds less than soft-sided equivalents. However, their increased failure rate and affinity for displaying scratches and wear aren\u2019t worth it, unless the bag\u2019s contents really need the extra protection from sharp jabs.\nThe soft fabric design allows for extra flexibility and the inclusion of exterior pockets, for quick access to small items. The Platinum Elite has two pockets: a flat one (suitable for documents and boarding passes) and an accordion-style one (which provides extra storage for miscellaneous small items; this can be a lifesaver if you\u2019re traveling with kids and need quick access to extra-small toys, coloring books, clothes, or other supplies).\nOrganization makes the dream work. During her three-week trip in New Zealand, photographer Caleigh Waldman said of the earlier, nearly identical model in the Platinum line, \u201cOn this trip I never stayed in the same location for more than three days and was forced to constantly unpack, repack, and maneuver [the bag]. Usually living out of any suitcase makes me crazy, but the many zip compartments [of this bag], both inside and out, make it easy to compartmentalize your things. The pockets, zippers, and interior liner seemed sturdy, and the large pull-back cover allowed me to access everything I had in the bag with ease.\u201d(Full disclosure: Years later we married, but I don\u2019t think that influenced her review.)\nSimilar to its smaller Travelpro sibling, the Carry-On Rollaboard, this suitcase has a built-in garment folder (or \u201csuiter\u201d). Additionally, a 2-inch-wide expansion zipper runs along three sides of the Platinum Elite, allowing the bag to accordion-open a touch, if you need the extra space (though we found this more useful as a way to compress what you\u2019ve already packed than as an additional-space-providing feature).\nIt moves through the world with ease. The Platinum Elite handles beautifully for its size. Its aluminum handle extends to three different heights (38 inches, 40 inches, and 42\u00bd inches). Although every bag we tested for this guide had similar levels of maneuverability, the Premium Elite\u2019s MagnaTrac wheels, which align in the same direction, rolled past the rest of the competition with ease. On smooth surfaces, like those found in airports, it felt as if the bag were almost directing itself across the floor.\nDuring her trip, Caleigh appreciated this suitcase\u2019s smooth rolling, even when the bag was overpacked, saying, \u201cIt was not always easy to maneuver on rough or gravelly surfaces. Overall, though, given the limitations of traveling with this much stuff, I thought [this bag] did a great job moving through a variety of environments.\u201d And it has sealed wheel bearings; these extend the wheels\u2019 life by preventing dirt and grime from entering and breaking down the components as quickly. That\u2019s a feature not usually found on cheaper bags. And chances are good that if a bag isn\u2019t clearly advertising sealed bearings, you should assume it doesn\u2019t have them.\nIt\u2019s light yet cavernous. The Platinum Elite weighs 9 pounds 8 ounces when empty, which is average to heavy among checked bags. That\u2019s a workable weight, though, for the bag\u2019s spacious, 6,982-cubic-inch interior\u2014twice what its carry-on sibling can hold! But when you\u2019re selecting luggage this large, weight shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern because all of the bags we tested felt about equally heavy once fully packed. The important thing is that, in our testing, the Platinum Elite swallowed up a week\u2019s worth of clothes for two people with no problem, with a good deal of room to spare.\nTravelpro also sells a Platinum Elite model that\u2019s 29 inches tall. It\u2019s important to emphasize just how absurdly large this suitcase is for most people. Given its capacity of 7,710.6 cubic inches (143 liters), the challenge here is to pack without breaking airline weight limits. I suppose if you were on a (very) long cruise, a bag this size might make sense.\nHow the Platinum Elite has held up\nAfter my wife\u2019s world travels, a neighbor borrowed this bag for their children\u2019s college travels (Hawaii to New York), making several trips over the past few years. The Platinum Elite is still going strong.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe warranty process may not be as easy as it should be. We\u2019re tracking a few complaints that the Travelpro Platinum Elite warranty system is difficult to navigate. That said, we haven't heard of many reports of people ever being denied their claims, only that initiating or entering your claim is potentially onerous or unwieldy.\nBags of this size can hold almost too much. The Platinum Elite bag already weighs over 9 pounds. So when you pack it to its limits, it may be hard to keep it below the 50-pound weight limit of most airlines\u2014and that means extra fees. But this is true of all checked luggage.\nDuring her New Zealand trip, Caleigh Waldman packed the Platinum Magna 2 (29-inch model) for two weeks, with enough clothes, toiletries, and different types of shoes and activewear for the terrain. Though she didn\u2019t fill the bag completely, she still found that her luggage came in over the 50-pound limit. \u201cEvery flight I took, I had to cough up the overweight-baggage fee, and it was a monster to carry up stairs and toss into car trunks,\u201d she said.\nTop pick for hard-sided luggage: Away The Medium Suitcase\nWe still think most travelers would be better off with one of our soft-sided picks than with a hard-sided carry-on. That\u2019s because soft-sided luggage shows less wear and typically lasts longer than hard-sided luggage. But if you prefer the look of hard-sided luggage, or you want the security of knowing you can\u2019t overpack your suitcase, Away\u2019s The Medium is the one we recommend.\nFrom wheels to warranty, it\u2019s the best polycarbonate option. Its wheels and zipper are as well made as those of our soft-sided picks, and its polycarbonate showed fewer scratches than its hard-sided competitors. And it\u2019s backed by a limited lifetime warranty.\nIt provides more than enough space. The Medium weighs 9.9 pounds and measures 26 by 18.5 by 11 inches\u2014a fairly standard weight and size for checked luggage this size. (By comparison, the Travelpro Platinum Elite 25-inch bag weighs 9.8 pounds and measures 28 by 18.5 by 11.75 inches.) If you need extra room, Away\u2019s The Large offers the maximum allowed space in a piece of checked luggage. The Large weighs 11.6 pounds and measures 29 by 20.5 by 12.5 inches. But with bags this big, it\u2019s easier to overpack and exceed airline weight limits, which is why we recommend the Away Medium for most people.\nDon\u2019t sweat the flex. The Away bag\u2019s modern and minimalist look comes at a cost: Its polycarbonate shell is ultimately\u2014according to every luggage designer we\u2019ve ever interviewed\u2014more likely to break than the nylon fabric of our other picks is to tear. Still, the shell feels similar to those of higher-end (and significantly more expensive) suitcases, such as the $1,000-plus Rimowa Essential Check-In M; it\u2019s strong and flexible, and the Away bag itself feels good in your hands.\nAway builds its luggage with impressive components. The wheels are noticeably better than those on any of the hard-sided competitors we\u2019ve tested. We\u2019ve rolled these wheels across every conceivable surface, from cobblestone streets to the smoothest airport surfaces, and they were always a pleasure to use.\nWhen we first started testing The Away bag, in 2016, we found that flexibility to be a liability, especially on airport carpets. The first version of this bag that I tested tended to flex into itself and jam up its own wheels when I pushed it in front of me. But I haven\u2019t had that issue with any of this suitcase\u2019s latest models.\nIts interior matches its minimal exterior. The Away bag\u2019s interior is almost as bare-bones as its exterior. Unlike our other picks, this bag has no included suiter or suit folder, but you can buy one for $65. The interior is split in half: One side closes with a zippered flap, and the other side has a built-in compression panel and straps, which work decently well.\nIt\u2019s better to stick with the basics. We tested Away luggage for three years before making our recommendation. We traveled with it ourselves across the country, and we lent models of the bag to several testers and frequent travelers to see how they enjoyed using them. Away makes two similar models of checked suitcases with an expandable zipper: The Medium Flex and The Large Flex.\nFor all intents and purposes, these are the same overall bags as the standard Medium and Large, except for the expanding center zipper and the price (they each cost $50 more). Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of expanding zippers. They feel like potentially just one more thing to break. Also, they can increase the likelihood of exceeding the airline\u2019s weight limit. But some people may prefer having the extra flexibility.\nLike our other picks, the Away pairs with its matching carry-on: The models are virtually identical, except for their sizes. Matching your luggage sets is visually appealing. But the real value in matching your carry-on to your checked luggage is that the smaller suitcase can, when you\u2019re back home, nest within the larger one. (This holds true for every set of luggage we\u2019ve ever tested. Here\u2019s why: Nesting luggage is the most economical way for luggage manufacturers to ship their wares from their factories overseas.)\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt comes with no suit panel. The lack of a panel for important items, like dresses and suits, may limit this suitcase\u2019s appeal for some travelers. With a bag that has this much space, though, there are other ways to pack fancy clothes (video) without wrinkling them.\nUpgrade pick: Briggs & Riley Baseline Expandable Spinner\nIf you fly more than 25,000 miles per year, it\u2019s worth investing in luggage that goes beyond the minimums and somehow improves your travel experience. The Briggs & Riley Baseline Medium Expandable 25\u2033 Spinner is that kind of bag. It costs nearly twice as much as our top soft-sided pick, but after using all of these bags side by side, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more than twice as much value hidden within this luggage: This is one of the best checked luggage systems we\u2019ve found for international travel.\nIt has the best compression system. This suitcase\u2019s most impressive feature is its compression system. Briggs & Riley\u2019s proprietary compression system is superior to anything else we\u2019ve seen\u2014it allows you to fit an additional week\u2019s worth of clothing into a bag with the same external dimensions as those of the Travelpro Platinum Elite suitcase. To manage it, you pull upward on two plastic handles inside the bag; this extends its depth by a full 2\u00bd inches. Load the bag as full as you need to, and zip it closed without putting stress on the zippers.\nThen you simply push on the bag to compress it back down again, and a latch mechanism keeps it securely in place. Unlike cheaper zippered expansion systems, which are either fully open or closed (like the Delsey bag\u2019s), this one can lock in at variable degrees of expansion or compression. This suitcase is unique and satisfying to use. (If you prefer a polycarbonate shell, Briggs & Riley has designed a similar compression system around a hard-shell case, for its Sympatico Spinner line. Still, we prefer the pliability of a soft-sided shell for any compression system.)\nMeasuring the extra capacity of the Baseline isn\u2019t exact. The bag\u2019s base (that is, where the wheels are) measures an inch deeper than the top of the bag (where the handle is); this design is, I believe, to make the base of the bag heavier when fully packed. At the base, the exterior of the Baseline Medium measures 25 by 18.5 by 10 inches; expanded, it measures 25 by 18.5 by 12 inches.\nIt takes hits like a brick. The Baseline Medium\u2019s exterior is wrapped in 1,680-denier ballistic nylon, which is durable and puncture resistant. (Denier is a measure of the fiber thickness in a fabric.) But even more impressive is what\u2019s underneath the nylon. The Baseline Medium\u2019s frame is the strongest we\u2019ve seen among any of the soft-sided luggage we tested. This bag can take considerable pressure from any angle. If it does become damaged, user-replaceable parts and a network of repair centers located around the world make quick fixes easy, and the reliable lifetime warranty covers all repairs.\nLike the Travelpro Platinum Elite, the Baseline Medium has two external pockets: a small one for tickets and passports and a larger one for small items or light outerwear. Briggs & Riley also makes a 31-inch Extra Large version of this bag, with nearly 10,000 cubic inches of interior space. It\u2019s a good bag, but we can\u2019t see the point of something this large. As it is, you can easily exceed most airlines\u2019 weight limits packing the Medium to capacity.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe handrails are exposed. Similar to its carry-on version, the Baseline Medium\u2019s handrail tubes are on the outside of the bag; this makes the inside back wall almost completely flat, so packing is easier because there are no crevices to work around. We liked this feature for lighter carry-on luggage, since exterior plastic handrail tubes can protect the bag when it\u2019s going over an edge, without risking too much damage. However, that all changes when you\u2019re bouncing a 50-pound bag over a curb; in that case, an exposed handrail system seems like an unnecessary risk, especially since there\u2019s so much room for an internal rail system.\nBest suitcase for trunk lovers: Monos Hybrid Trunk\nTrunks are a welcome new addition (reimagined from a somewhat older tradition) to checked-luggage lines. Longer than they are wide, modern travel trunks\u2014including our pick, the Monos Hybrid Trunk\u2014stand out against the more-common squat, square luggage of the last few decades.\nIt has a pleasant shape, and it\u2019s easy to maneuver. The Monos Hybrid measures 30 by 15.7 by 14.3 inches, with a capacity of 6,735.3 cubic inches, and it weighs 13.2 pounds. Imagine something like a small steamer trunk, except without the team of stevedores to move it.\nIn our early testing, we\u2019ve found that the Monos Hybrid, with its taller, narrower shape, is easier to wheel around than other checked luggage. There\u2019s something about the four wheels\u2019 relative proximity to one another that gives the trunk a remarkable agility across most surfaces. Its wheels make it handle more like a carry-on bag than the other checked luggage we tested.\nIt\u2019s a pleasure to pack. This element is harder to explain. Packing the trunk somehow just feels more pleasant than packing other types of luggage. Maybe it\u2019s the main compartment\u2019s higher walls, which give a comforting feeling of placing your clothes deep within the confines of a box. Or perhaps it\u2019s the shape\u2019s somewhat vintage appeal, bringing up nostalgia for a type of travel you\u2019ve never experienced except in movies. Packing clothes into the Hybrid Trunk for a long journey is like stepping back in time just for a moment.\nThat said, unlike the steamer trunks of yore, the modern Monos Hybrid doesn\u2019t have a ton of extra organization. One side has a fabric cover that completely zips in the contents; the other side has a compression panel with two zippered pockets. That said, for most modern travelers using (I hope) a good set of packing cubes, these simple dividers should be plenty to keep everything in the right place.\nThe Hybrid Trunk does away with the standard zipper closure, opting instead for an aluminum frame that runs along the seam of the luggage, where a zipper might have been. The case has two TSA locks, which close with a satisfying latch. We\u2019ve reviewed a few bags with latches like this, and they\u2019re great. Our only concern is that these locks have lots of small moving components, which could be a weak point over time.\nIt\u2019s made for long, tough journeys. The only trunk models we\u2019ve seen so far are made of polycarbonate. The Monos Hybrid immediately stands out with three details: an aluminum frame around the center seam that reinforces the body of the luggage, aluminum corner guards, and a reassuringly robust polycarbonate.\nThe Monos Hybrid Trunk, like our other picks, is protected by a lifetime warranty.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nSome airlines may flag this bag as oversize. We\u2019ve heard from one traveler we know that Delta charged them an oversize fee when they checked their Monos Hybrid Trunk. Other airlines have, in our experience, been more lenient. If your chosen airline has a reputation (as Delta does) for being persnickety, maybe skip this bag.\nIt might be best for one-destination trips. Another potential flaw we\u2019ve found so far (we\u2019ve tested trunks for only a few months) is that a trunk design may require more packing and unpacking to find what you need if you\u2019re making lots of stops while traveling. A suitcase with a clamshell design, on the other hand, has both sides more or less open to you for easier access.\nIt has no suit folder. Like the Away, the Monos Hybrid Trunk doesn\u2019t have a dedicated suit compartment for dresses or formal wear. Again, though, with this much space to pack in, there are a number of ways to protect such clothes.\nOther suitcases worth considering\nIf the Monos Hybrid Trunk is unavailable: Consider Away\u2019s The Trunk, which has a similar design (apart from having a zipper, instead of latches) for a similar price. However, though we\u2019re generally fans of Away\u2019s luggage, The Trunk isn\u2019t as satisfying to use as the Monos Hybrid. The Away Trunk\u2019s shell is flexible and its body is light, so it lacks the robust feel of the Monos Hybrid.\nThe competition\nDelsey Helium Aero: our previous hard-sided pick, comes in a 25-inch and a 29-inch version, so you can choose how much capacity you need. Like the Away suitcase, this bag is made of 100% polycarbonate, so it should last longer than cheaper, less-durable ABS plastic suitcases. However, Delsey\u2019s 10-year limited warranty doesn\u2019t match Away\u2019s limited lifetime warranty.\nBriggs & Riley Torq Medium Spinner: Briggs & Riley makes excellent luggage, but we don\u2019t think you need to spend this much on a hard-sided case without any extra frills.\nRimowa Essential Check-In M: Rimowa defined hard-sided luggage in the 1940s and redefined it in 2000, when it introduced polycarbonate luggage. But paying just over $1,000 for \u201cvirgin German polycarbonate\u201d is silly. These bags are smart-looking, though.\nLevel8 Voyageur Check-In: We were interested in the large handle of the Level8, which promised to lend easier control over a large piece of luggage, but we didn\u2019t see much improvement.\nWe also tested and dismissed Delsey, Pelican, and Samsonite suitcases that have since been discontinued.\nThis article was edited by Ria Misra and Christine Ryan."

      "text": "It\u2019s a cool night and you have everyone gathered around the fire. You strike the first match, anticipating the glorious blaze that will soon ignite everyone\u2019s imagination.\nBut instead, nothing but thick smoke billows from your carefully built pile of wood. Folks are coughing and rubbing their eyes as they step away from the fire to breathe fresh air, kids are demanding to know when they can make s\u2019mores, and you\u2019re left scratching your head and trying to figure out why this fire is so smokey.\nUltimately, the quality of your fire will come down to the quality of your wood. Like many things in life, it\u2019s simple - great firewood creates great fires, and bad firewood creates bad fires.\nOrder the Best Firewood Available!\nWhy You Don\u2019t Want a Smokey Fire (And How to Prevent It)\nEvery fire will create some smoke, but some fires can create a lot more smoke than others. Dark smoke is unpleasant for many reasons: it makes your eyes burn, it can make it hard to breathe, it will make you smell bad, and it can completely ruin a fun fire experience.\nFires are meant to be beautiful, but when those flickering flames get replaced by nasty smoke it, well\u2026 it ruins the mystique.\nPeople will sit further away to avoid the smoke (or they\u2019ll leave) and miss out on the cozy warmth the fire provides. Speaking of warmth, a smokey fire produces less heat than one with dancing flames.\nIf you\u2019re trying to cook over a fire, whether it\u2019s s\u2019mores, hot dogs, or a full gourmet meal, greasy dark smoke does not add good flavor. Clear, light blue smoke, on the other hand, can infuse your ingredients with an incredible wood-smoked flavor.\nDark smoke also makes it tough for the cook to get close enough to the fire as well.\nFor these reasons and more, you don\u2019t want a smokey fire.\nWhy your fire might be so smokey\nSo, what causes some fires to be smokier than others?\nWell, there are several reasons why your fire might be so smokey.\nLet\u2019s explore the 5 most common causes:\n1) You\u2019re using wet wood\nWet wood will always create smokier fires. There are a couple of reasons for this:\nFirst, as the moisture in the wood heats up, it will burn off and turn into steam. This steam mixes with the smoke of the burning wood and makes the smoke much thicker than the smoke from dry wood.\nSecond, wet wood is problematic because it prevents the wood from burning as hot. Smoke will start at lower temperatures than flame, so if your wood is smoldering it will create a lot of smoke. When a fire is hotter, it creates more flame and less smoke. Wet wood makes this difficult.\nIn order to prevent this, make sure you burn only firewood for sale that is dry and dense. Cutting Edge Firewood, for instance, has a moisture content that is less than 10%. Green firewood (freshly cut or fallen from a tree) will have a moisture content of 50%, and even seasoned firewood will contain 20-30% moisture.\nKiln-dried wood offers a significant reduction in moisture content and, therefore, will create a significantly less smokey fire.\n2) You\u2019re burning wood with mold or fungus\nIf you use seasoned firewood or wood that has sat outside for too long, it could grow mold or fungus. When you burn this wood, it will burn off the mold and fungus and these things create a lot of smoke.\nNot only that, but they aren\u2019t exactly the kind of thing you want being released into the air around your friends or family.\nInspect your firewood for fungus or mold and don\u2019t burn it if it isn\u2019t clean. Once again, choosing to burn kiln-dried firewood will prevent this from being a problem. The kiln drying process kills all mold, fungus, and bugs and creates a safer, cleaner burn.\n3) You\u2019re burning yard debris\nIt can be tempting to start a fire with leaves, pine straw, or pinecones.\nThey can sometimes create a quick flame, but they can also create a lot of smoke (and ash).\nOftentimes, yard debris is still quite wet (either because it has freshly fallen or because of the weather). This moisture will contribute to the smoke.\nYard debris also reduces oxygen flow, which makes it harder for the fire to heat up and burn well, and can also contain dirt or sap, which will also add to the smokiness of your fire.\nInstead, we recommend using all-natural fire starters and quality kindling. You\u2019ll get a clean burn that will heat up quickly and makes lighting your larger logs much easier. Each of our boxes of firewood contains a small sampling of fire starters and kindling, but we also sell a complete fire starter package with enough starters and kindling for 15-25 fires.\n4) You aren\u2019t letting your fire breathe\nA good fire needs three things: heat, a fuel source, and oxygen.\nIf you stack your logs too tightly together, it reduces the available oxygen and can make it hard to get a fire going. This can snuff out flames (sometimes before they even start) and cause the wood to smolder instead of burn.\nWhen the wood smolders, it creates more smoke.The trick is to stack your firewood logs so that they are close enough to share heat, but far enough away that they can still breathe. If you want to learn how to stack, start, and maintain a fire then be sure you watch this video:\n5) You\u2019re burning trash:\nBurning trash is always a bad idea.\nWhile you probably aren\u2019t out there trying to burn an entire week\u2019s worth of garbage, it can be tempting, while sitting by the fire, to toss in some food wrappers or solo cups when you\u2019re done using them\nDon\u2019t do it!\nAny kind of trash will add to the smoke and could release toxic fumes into the air that will be bad for everyone.\nKeep your fire clean from trash and everyone will have a better experience.\n6) You\u2019re using softwoods like pine\nIt\u2019s easy to find softwoods lying on the ground in many parts of America. Pine trees drop limbs like it\u2019s their job, and the wood can light up pretty easily once dry.\nThe only problem is, pine trees contain a resin-like substance that burns and creates dark smoke. Softwoods also are not great for your fire pit or fireplace because they burn so quickly.\nIt\u2019s okay to use a small piece of heartpine as a fire starter \u2013 it will light easily and burn quickly to help get your kindling lit. Because the piece is small, it won\u2019t produce too much smoke and it creates a lovely aroma.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s important to always choose hardwoods over softwoods for building a fire. Evergreen trees are typically softwoods, whereas trees that are deciduous and create leaves are hardwoods.\nGood hardwoods for burning include cherry firewood, oak firewood, and hickory firewood.\nWhere to get firewood that is less smokey\nIf you wanted to summarize all the causes of a smokey fire into a single thing, it is ultimately about the quality of your firewood.\nIf you burn good wood, you\u2019ll have a good fire.\nThe only problem is, it can be really hard to source firewood that is of consistently good quality. You might grab a bundle of firewood from the grocery store that works well, but your next bundle could be a total disaster. You might get a delivery in your driveway one year that burns okay, but the next load could be wet and moldy.\nCutting Edge Firewood was founded for this very reason \u2013 we were tired of the consistently poor quality of wood in the firewood industry. So, we worked with suppliers to develop the most rigorous and consistent drying process in the world.\nAll of our firewood gets cut while fresh and placed into a kiln for 48 hours at 250 degrees \u2013 this is 12 times more rigorous than the USDA requirements for kiln-dried firewood. This means our wood is consistently dry, dense, and clean. It provides a great burning experience every time you use it. Then we hand select every piece to insure that it is unmatched.\nThe other challenge with obtaining good firewood is knowing where to go. Fortunately, with Cutting Edge Firewood, you don\u2019t have to go anywhere! We bring the firewood directly to you!\nWe offer a complimentary delivery artisan service to a growing network of places including Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, and more.\nIf you\u2019re not in our delivery artisan network then no worries \u2013 we also ship our firewood nationwide.\nIt\u2019s never been easier to obtain quality firewood, so place an order with Cutting Edge Firewood today. We\u2019re confident you will love the firewood and have a great experience!"

      "text": "The Best Charcoal for Grilling\nThe right charcoal can make your grilling experience more consistent, produce better tasting food, and leave less clean up. After much research and testing, we\u2019re convinced that Royal Oak Premium Charcoal Briquets are the best charcoal for your grill. This charcoal burns hotter, lasts longer, and produces less ash than nearly every other briquet we tested. It\u2019s competitively priced, and it\u2019s available all year from stores such as Home Depot and Walmart.\nIn tests, the Royal Oak Premium Charcoal Briquets, sometimes called Ridge Briquets, sustained average temperatures of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour and lasted for a total of 80 minutes of cook time\u2014the second-best results of any charcoal we tried, and plenty of heat to produce excellent charring and searing. These briquets left behind less ash than Kingsford Original Charcoal, and didn\u2019t impart any unpleasant flavors to our burgers. We\u2019ve found Royal Oak charcoal to be widely available in stores like Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot\u2013\u2013it\u2019s often easier to pick up a bag in person than to order it online.\nBriquets have a uniform density and size that allow for steady temperature control, but if you want lump wood charcoal instead, our favorite is Fogo All Natural Premium Hardwood Charcoal. Lump wood has its pros and cons, but the bottom line is that the Fogo lump wood burned hotter, became ready to cook faster, and added a richer, more robust flavor to the food than any other lump wood we tested. As with all lump wood, the size and shape can make lighting and arranging the coals difficult, and can lead to less-predictable cooking times. In fact, the Fogo brand had some of the largest chunks of wood we saw out of all the lump wood we tested\u2014one piece in particular nearly filled half a chimney.\nHow we picked and tested\nWe interviewed grilling experts including Doug Hanthorn of the The Naked Whiz, John Dawson of Patio Daddio BBQ, and Dennis Linkletter of Komodo Kamado. Although they had different recommendations for products, they all told us that consistency is paramount, so we focused on briquets, although we also found a lump wood charcoal option that we like.\nIn 2015, we focused our testing only on charcoal briquets. We assembled our list of contenders after researching reviews on Amazon, The Naked Whiz, and Patio Daddio BBQ, hunting down recommendations on forums like The BBQ Brethren, and looking at our own results from the previous year. That left us with seven main contenders.\nI spent a day on my roof, burning through controlled batches of each one. In another part of our testing, we did side-by-side comparisons of individual brands from separate bags to test for uniformity. All brands performed nearly equally. We skipped self-lighting briquets because there\u2019s no need to add petroleum distillates when a good charcoal chimney will do the job.\nAlthough the fairest way to test charcoal is to weigh it out into equal piles to ensure uniform amounts of carbon despite differing densities, that isn\u2019t the most realistic method. Because we assumed that most people don\u2019t bother to weigh out their charcoal before using it, we instead measured our charcoal by volume, filling up our 250-cubic-inch chimney to the designated \u201cfull\u201d line each time (like normal people).\nOnce we ignited the top pieces of charcoal, we poured the coals into one side of a standard 22.5-inch Weber One Touch Gold kettle grill and recorded a range of temperatures along the pile every five minutes using a Fluke Ti32 thermal imager, which Fluke generously loaned to us. Once the charcoal finished burning, we measured the ash production by volume. The grill remained uncovered during the burn, with the bottom vents half open. At 60 minutes, if charcoal was still burning, I gave the grill three solid shakes to see how the briquets were holding up. At this point, usually the charcoal pile was so small and covered with ash that if it were your grill, you probably would have added a new chimney\u2019s worth if you wanted to continue grilling. For a few brands, this knocking around gave new life to the coals, and for others it was pretty much the end of the line.\nWe also performed a fairly subjective taste test with four friends as \u201cfood tasters\u201d and several pounds of nearly identical premade \u2153-pound all-beef burgers from Western Beef. Our other testing goal (beyond taste) was to see how well done our burgers cooked over each charcoal. To that end we cooked each burger for four minutes on each side, cooking the burgers successively over the course of 40 minutes.\nWhat we observed was that different charcoals gave off different radiations of heat despite having similar surface temperatures, and that certain charcoals imparted distinct flavors onto the burgers we cooked. For our tastes, none of the charcoals gave the food an acrid or otherwise bad flavor\u2014but the ones with the highest searing heat gave the burgers the best flavor overall.\nCare and maintenance, plus setup tips\nYou need to keep a few things in mind when using and storing charcoal. First, ensure that your charcoal stays dry by storing it in a cool, dry place. For a detailed look at charcoal storage and the myth surrounding wet-charcoal storage and spontaneous combustion, read The Naked Whiz\u2019s ultra-informative article.\nWhen it comes to lighting charcoal, we recommend using a simple chimney lighter. The worst thing, in our opinion, would be to use lighter fluid or (shudder) self-lighting charcoal except in the most desperate Jack London\u2013esque situations. If you are for some reason compelled to cook food over self-lighting charcoal, at least do yourself a favor and wait until the briquets are completely white before you begin cooking. Though this waiting period will not guarantee that all the additives present have burned off, it may at least allow for the removal of some of the volatile organic compounds that charcoal lighter can introduce. For more on the most practical ways to build and light a charcoal fire for both long and short cooks, you can rely on the expertise of Craig \u201cMeathead\u201d Goldwyn, who outlines most of the best practical methods in this article.\nLump wood vs. briquets\nToday, briquets and lump wood are the two most common types of charcoal available in the US. But it\u2019s not that simple\u2014you can now find self-lighting briquets, original briquets, and all-natural briquets along with bags of various types of lump woods, which are either mixed or advertised as a single variety of wood such as mesquite. This bewildering array of options has ignited a white-hot ideological debate at the heart of American grilling. Choosing between lump wood and briquets can send even the most sensible barbecue fanatic into a diatribe.\nLump wood charcoal is just that: It\u2019s lumps of wood turned into charcoal. You can actually make lump wood charcoal in your backyard if you\u2019re so inclined. To many people, lump wood\u2019s simplicity is its primary advantage: It contains no vegetable oil or starch binder, nothing you can\u2019t see\u2014just good hardwood char, which carries a lot of flavor and produces minimal ash. But the problem with lump wood (if you see it as a problem) is that it isn\u2019t uniform. Because no two pieces of lump wood have the same shape, no two pieces of lump wood ever burn the same. From bag to bag\u2014handful to handful, even\u2014your temperature and cooking time can vary wildly.\nBriquets bring industrial uniformity to charcoal. They're a nearly hundred-year-old invention from the mind of Henry Ford, who saw a way to profit from the scrap timber and sawdust that his Model-T production lines were throwing away. A mixture of wood or paper mash goes through dry heating and mixing (in the case of Kingsford, with anthracite coal and lime). After binding with corn starch, the mixture gets pressure-molded into uniform briquet shapes. Briquets offer you a certain amount of consistency while you cook, and as you get comfortable with your grill and chimney, you can start to gauge how many briquets equals how many minutes of cooking depending on how you set up your grill. Briquets are also somewhat denser than the average lump wood alternative, so a pound of charcoal briquets can take much less space in your grill than a pound of lump wood.\nWhich form of charcoal is \u201cbetter,\u201d depends on who you ask. Doug Hanthorn of The Naked Whiz champions lump wood because it\u2019s \u201c100 percent pure\u201d, and his site\u2019s forums host some serious lump wood fanatics.\nOn the other side we have John Dawson, competitive barbecue champ and maintainer of Patio Daddio BBQ, who\u2019s a staunch briquet advocate. He was raised on the stuff with his father, who told him not to waste time with anything else.\u201cFor me the bottom line is that it doesn\u2019t do me any good to produce the best barbecue in the world if I can\u2019t reproduce the results time in and time out,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all about eliminating variables. Number one out of the gate is to get the fuel nailed.\u201d\nWe think briquets that attempt to limit the number of additives are better for most people\u2014they bridge the gap between additive-free but irregularly shaped lump wood and consistently formed briquets that are more predictable and easy to control. You get the best of both worlds (at a slight premium).\nThe competition\nStubb\u2019s 100% All-Natural Bar-B-Q Charcoal Briquets were a previous runner-up pick in this guide. Although the briquets burned longer and hotter, and produced less ash, than most of the competition, overall they proved difficult to find after the summer of 2016. Cowboy Charcoal, the distributor of Stubb\u2019s charcoal, sells a new hardwood briquet. But we haven\u2019t yet verified whether it matches our former runner-up pick, so we can\u2019t recommend it at this time.\nWhile Kingsford Original Charcoal briquets are cheap, consistent, and perfectly adequate for most basic grilling needs, they simply didn\u2019t work as well as other charcoals we tested, which burned hotter for a longer period of time. Kingsford Original briquets contain substances such as mineral char, mineral carbon (coal to you and me, though Kingsford processes it in an oxygen-controlled environment, and we really could say it\u2019s \u201cpure carbon\u201d), limestone, borax, sodium nitrate, and sawdust. All of those substances add up to a lot of ash toward the end of your cook and weaken the overall performance of these briquets in competition against simpler briquet formulas. In our tests, Kingsford charcoal cooled off and burned out faster than the better charcoals we found. Kingsford is one the cheapest charcoals around, however, and you can find it for sale everywhere. And with its uniquely identifiable flavor and smell, it\u2019s been a key component of plenty of barbecuing-championship victories around the country every year.\nKingsford Professional Briquets (previously called Competition Briquets) are Kingsford\u2019s entry in the \u201call-natural\u201d briquet category. They contain only wood char, starch binders, and very small amounts of borax that serve to release the briquets from the briquet mold during manufacturing. This charcoal burned a bit hotter initially than the Kingsford Original formula, but not as hot or as long as our pick.\nRancher 100% All-Natural Hardwood Briquette Charcoal is available year-round in several locations in Georgia and South Carolina. The lack of general availability means we couldn\u2019t recommend this charcoal as our overall top pick or even our runner-up. But as Wirecutter editor Harry Sawyers pointed out, \u201cIf you go see the Gamecocks lose in Athens this month, then you can bet you'll smell some Rancher near Sanford Stadium.\u201d\nRoyal Oak 100% All Natural Hardwood Lump Wood Charcoal is a lot like other lump woods we tested, and we didn\u2019t find anything particularly wrong with it. It burned well, had a nice variety of lump wood sizes, and gave off a moderate amount of ash (not the worst offender out of all the lump wood brands we tested but not the best either). Although Royal Oak\u2019s lump wood is more widely available than Fogo\u2019s, the (slightly) cheaper, hotter, and longer-burning Fogo lump wood merely outclassed it.\nWe also dismissed extruded charcoals like those sold by Komodo Kamado. Usually made from the shells or husks of fruits like coconut or rambutan fruit, extruded charcoal is big in Southeast Asia. This kind of charcoal is perfect if you\u2019re cooking with a ceramic oven or ceramic grill such as the Komodo Kamado ceramic grill or the Big Green Egg; in fact, it was originally designed for the ceramic ovens that are popular in Southeast Asia. In a ceramic grill, extruded charcoal has a long burn time, even temperature, and low smoke production\u2014but it's terrible in an open grill like a Weber. Due to the extrusion process, which subjects coconut husk char to intense pressure and binds it into a log, these logs burn quickly in an open setting and leave behind a veritable mountain of ash when compared with traditional wood charcoal. This ash production also reduces the charcoal\u2019s overall heat during use in a conventional grill. In short, extruded charcoal is great for ceramic ovens but bad for grills.\nWe also tested and dismissed a traditional Japanese charcoal (its origin stretches back 1,200 years) called binchotan charcoal and its cousin, sumi charcoal. Made from white oak, binchotan charcoal results from a specially designed process that produces very dense, very pure charcoal. Because binchotan burns at a lower temperature and for long periods of time with very little smoke, it traditionally served to heat indoor yaki grills or tea for the ritualized tea ceremony during the Edo period. It\u2019s fascinating stuff but totally impractical for modern kettle-style grilling, and it\u2019s 10 to 20 times more expensive than standard briquet or lump wood charcoal.\nThis article was edited by Harry Sawyers.\nSources\nForum, Barbecue!

      "text": "The Best Camping Tents\nWhether you\u2019re thinking of hitting the road or staying close to home for your next car-camping adventure, you and your loved ones will need a comfortable place to sleep.\nAfter researching nearly 100 tents, talking to tent designers and tent-pole manufacturers, and sleeping in a total of 54 tents on 12 weekend camping trips over seven years, we\u2019ve concluded that the Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 3 Tent is the best car-camping tent for two people, and the Kelty Wireless 6 is the best choice for most families.\nThe Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 3 Tent is the best car-camping tent choice for couples. It has everything you need for three-season camping, with the bonus of being light enough to double as an occasional backpacking tent. Although it\u2019s designed to accommodate three people\u2014hence the \u201c3\u201d in its name\u2014we found that at 42.5 square feet, the tent is more comfortable for two, plus gear and maybe a medium-size dog.\nA classic polyester dome tent, the Mineral King 3 uses two high-quality pre-bent aluminum poles, which maximize head and shoulder space, making this tent feel less cramped than other dome tents we tested. Two large doors provide easy entry and exit, and a vestibule\u2014that\u2019s camping speak for \u201cmudroom\u201d\u2014outside each door adds significant sheltered storage. The Mineral King 3 has a full rain fly, which you can roll up halfway or completely remove for epic stargazing. It also comes with a groundsheet (aka footprint) to protect the tent floor.\nIn 2025, Mountain Hardwear released (and we tested) an updated version of the Mineral King with symmetrical doors, and a cord that runs through the tent\u2019s canopy interior, which adds extra stabilization in windy conditions and space for hanging damp gear and lights.\nThe Kelty Wireless 6 is a spacious tent that is easy to pitch, and it offers solid weather protection and durability for a reasonable price. Like the Mineral King 3, it has a simple, dome-style design that maximizes livability and minimizes headaches. With 87 square feet of interior space, plus 28 square feet of vestibule space, the polyester tent fits four adults comfortably, or two adults with two or three children, with plenty of room to store gear and muddy boots. (As its name indicates, it\u2019s meant to house six people, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend that.) The Wireless 6 has two large doors and a full rain fly.\nLike most tents we saw in its price range, the Wireless 6 uses cheaper materials: Its poles (two, plus a \u201cbrow\u201d pole that supports the two vestibules) are fiberglass, and its stakes are too light for their size (two bent during testing). Unlike the competition, this tent is functional, durable, and a joy to inhabit in most weather conditions. (We did notice that the fly took longer to dry than others we tested; don\u2019t put it away while it\u2019s still damp, or it\u2019ll mildew.) It packs into a duffle with a handy shoulder strap and weighs about 17 pounds\u2014manageable for most people across short distances. As with most six-person tents we\u2019ve seen, this tent\u2019s footprint is sold separately.\nThough the Marmot Tungsten 4-Person Tent lacks the Mineral King 3\u2019s adaptable fly, which makes access and protection from the elements such a breeze, the Tungsten 4 provides more living space and equal protection against the elements. A full rain fly with easy-attach color-coded clips covers the tent body and adds two large vestibules. Like the Mineral King 3, the Tungsten has aluminum poles that are connected at the top (for lightning-quick pitching) and pre-bent, which increases the dome tent\u2019s headroom. With pentagonal doors and a fly scaffolded by two brow poles\u2014as opposed to the Mineral King 3\u2019s single one\u2014this tent provides excellent shielding from multidirectional wind and rain, providing you follow the setup instructions faithfully.\nThe Tungsten 4\u2019s poles are bent at a more acute angle and closer to the ground, which, we discovered, can cause the tent to collapse in windy conditions if you don\u2019t attach the poles to the fly using the Velcro tabs running under the seams. You can also set up the tent without the fly while retaining some privacy, since the tent body has a high polyester wall on one side. Like the Mineral King 3, this tent comes with a footprint.\nThe best-selling Coleman Sundome 6-Person Tent has a footprint larger (100 square feet) than that of our top-pick tent for families, but it felt smaller because it has a lower ceiling, no vestibule, and only one door. Nevertheless, it still comfortably accommodates four people, and it\u2019s a roomy choice for two. This no-nonsense tent is intuitive to set up, has mesh on the top halves of two walls, includes a partial rain fly that\u2019s easy to put on and stake out, and feels cheery inside and out. (We don\u2019t recommend the smaller version of this tent for couples who might actually take it on the road; it was just too flimsy in our tests.) Also note that this tent does not come with its own groundsheet. Coleman says that the tent doesn\u2019t need one, probably because its floor is a crinkly (though tough) tarp-like polyethylene, not a taped-seam polyester as in our other picks.\nThe North Face Wawona 6 costs $200 more than the Wireless 6, but if you can swing the price, the tent offers a superior combination of livable space, smart design, and durable, high-quality materials (aluminum and heavy-duty polyester and mesh). Its fly extends into a huge front vestibule that can store large items like bikes, or even accommodate a table and chairs. Adults over 6 feet tall will be able to walk upright inside this tent\u2014which has almost-vertical walls that can easily accommodate beds, cribs, and cots\u2014as well as in the vestibule.\nWe also appreciated the tent\u2019s construction, which combines good ventilation (the upper part of the canopy walls are mesh) with campsite privacy (those mesh bits are covered by the fly, which reaches only halfway down the tent on the back and sides). And this tent is easy to set up and pack down, especially considering its size. (It comes with a carrying bag equipped with duffle-style handles.) You\u2019re unlikely to find a similar-sized tent that matches the Wawona\u2019s quality and features for less money\u2014most comparable tents we tested cost much more. As with most six-person tents, the Wawona 6\u2019s footprint is sold separately.\nCar campers who plan to brave miserable weather will appreciate the extra strength and protection of the REI Co-op Base Camp 4 Tent. The main bodies of our other picks are structured with two main poles with added support from smaller brow poles. The Base Camp, by contrast, has four full-size aluminum struts woven throughout it, somewhat like a basket, plus an additional brow pole that frames the front entrance and supports the larger of the two vestibules. The Base Camp also offers more privacy compared with our other picks\u2014with or without the rain fly. Our other favorite features are the tent\u2019s two wide doors, which you can open halfway from either direction or open fully (you can tuck the doors into \u201croof pockets\u201d to keep them out of the way), turning the tent into a useful beach tent or sun shade.\nFamilies who regularly pitch their tent in rainy locales need a wind-fighting tent with a good-size vestibule for storing wet shoes and gear, as well as a full rain fly for added weather protection. With almost 45 feet of vestibule space and four stability-enhancing criss-crossing poles, the next size up of REI\u2019s Base Camp, the Base Camp 6 Tent, offers the best combination of space and features among the six tents we tested that fit those criteria. A footprint for each model is sold separately.\nThe research\n- Why you should trust us\n- Who this is for\n- How we picked\n- How (and where) we tested\n- Best camping tent for two people: Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 3 Tent\n- Best camping tent for families: Kelty Wireless 6 Person Tent\n- Runner-up tent for two people: Marmot Tungsten 4-Person Tent\n- Best budget tent: Coleman Sundome 6-Person Tent\n- Upgrade tent for families: North Face Wawona 6 Tent\n- Best for unpredictable weather: REI Co-op Base Camp 4 Tent and Base Camp 6 Tent\n- Other tents worth considering\n- The competition\n- Care, use, and maintenance\n- Sources\nWhy you should trust us\nAn avid hiker, camper, and long-haul road-tripper, Claire Wilcox has slept in (and occasionally improvised) tents in 11 states. She covers outdoor gear for Wirecutter and worked on the most recent update of this guide, testing couples\u2019 tents and family tents. She lives on Oahu, Hawaii.\nA senior staff writer at Wirecutter, Kit Dillon has written about everything from backpacks and cooking gear to luggage and road-tripping. When he was younger, he worked for five years on oil rigs as an NDT (non-destructive testing) inspector, testing metal and welds for signs of corrosion, rust, and whatever other breakdowns and chaos might happen to the steel in the ocean. It is oddly relevant work for testing aluminum tent poles.\nThis guide also builds on the work of Kalee Thompson, a senior editor at Wirecutter.\nWho this is for\nFor this guide, we focused on tents that suit the most common terrains you\u2019re likely to encounter when car-camping\u2014grassy lawns or clearings, beaches, dirt campsites, and basic platforms\u2014in spring, summer, and fall. We\u2019re not looking at tents designed for such specialized activities as mountaineering, backpacking, or winter camping, though some of our recommendations have cross-over potential.\nEven if you\u2019re not seeking any extreme-weather adventures, you\u2019ll still need something that can withstand whatever the elements throw your way. The tents we discuss here are designed to keep you comfortable in wind, rain, and even light snow. (If you find yourself in a lightning storm, it\u2019s best to seek shelter in your car or abandon the adventure for a motel, especially if you\u2019re camping in an exposed area.)\nFinding a small, light tent is the logical approach when you\u2019re backpacking. But with car camping\u2014the industry term for what most people consider just camping\u2014you\u2019ll likely be parking next to your campsite and unloading. If you won\u2019t be carrying your tent more than a couple hundred feet, more space means more comfort (as well as more room for your stuff).\nHow we picked\nAfter putting in about 40 hours studying online reviews and company websites, as well as spending time consulting with frequent campers (both with and without kids) and considering our own diverse car-camping experiences, we evaluated the options (about 100, in the course of the past seven years) according to the following criteria:\nThe right capacity: Tent makers measure tent capacity by how many people can fit in them sardine-style, lying inside mummy bags. That means you can fit six adults in a six-person tent\u2014but you probably wouldn\u2019t want to do that, because those adults would be sleeping hip to hip, with little spare room for gear.\nWe concluded that the best option for two people is actually a large three-person, or smaller four-person, tent that\u2019s 40 to 60 square feet in size. For families with three to five members, we concluded that the best option is a tent rated for six people that\u2019s between 80 and 100 square feet. Also, the height should be at least six feet, which allows most adults to comfortably stand upright inside. \u201cWhen you camp with kids, you camp with a lot of gear,\u201d Helen Olsson, author of The Down and Dirty Guide to Camping with Kids, told us. Olsson has three kids, a dog, and a six-foot-two husband. Bigger is better when it comes to car camping, she said: \u201cLook for a base-camp-style tent that is meant for when you pull up in your car and pitch your tent right there.\u201d All of the tents we considered fall into that category.\nA dome shape: Usually designed around two- or three-pole arches, dome-style tents tend to be stronger than cabin-style designs, which maximize ceiling height by sacrificing some structural integrity. The dome shape does reduce overall livable space, but it\u2019s better at deflecting winds and shedding rain, something you\u2019re likely to appreciate if an unexpected storm hits. Our picks are all dome-style tents.\nAdequate weatherproofing and durability: A good dome-style tent should be able to withstand high winds and driving rain without pitching or collapsing. We assumed that most car campers would likely not be camping in snow, so we focused on three-season models instead. Most of the tents we looked at could handle an unexpected flurry or a coating of frost, but we wouldn\u2019t intentionally take them on a winter-camping trip.\nTent makers generally treat the fabrics with a water-repellent coating described in millimeters; 1,200 mm to 3,000 mm is the typical range found on family tents. That number does not refer to the thickness of the coating or the fabric; instead, it measures a specific test of water pressure, namely, how many millimeters of water can sit on top of the material before water starts leaking through. (As a Coleman product manager told us, \u201cNothing\u2019s waterproof, not even submarines. Given the right conditions anything will leak.\u201d) A higher number means better water resistance, but such stronger coatings aren\u2019t always necessary: As this MSR blog post explains, \u201cthe more coating you add, the heavier and more rigid the fabric becomes, and\u2014after a point\u2014the more susceptible to tearing.\u201d A typical umbrella has a rating of only 420 mm, the company\u2019s experts point out, and it does just fine at keeping you dry.\nIt\u2019s natural to focus on the quality of a tent\u2019s rain fly\u2014you need that piece to work when the skies open up. But according to our experts, the durability of the floor of your tent is actually more important. Tent designer Bob Howe, who has developed models for nearly every major tent maker, including Easton, Marmot, The North Face, REI, and Sierra Designs, said that when it comes to a tent floor, two lightweight layers are often stronger than one heavy layer; he suggested using a groundsheet or footprint, even with a high-quality tent floor. If the tent you buy doesn\u2019t come with a footprint (two of our recommended tents, the Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 3 and the Marmot Tungsten 4, do), we recommend purchasing a companion footprint, if one is available. A footprint doesn\u2019t take up much space, is relatively inexpensive, and is much easier to repair or replace than a tent bottom if it tears. A basic tarp can do in a pinch.\nThe right materials for the job: On most tents, the walls and flies are made of either nylon or polyester. Nylon weighs less but is more susceptible to UV damage, which makes it better for backpacking, when a tent spends most of its daylight hours packed up. Car campers generally leave their tents up for much longer periods of time, increasing the material\u2019s UV exposure. As polyester is stiffer and heavier than nylon but not as susceptible to UV damage, Howe told us, and it doesn\u2019t absorb water like nylon does, it\u2019s generally better for car camping. It\u2019s also less expensive.\nTo compare tent fabrics, you also need to know their overall rip strength. For most fabrics, rip strength is expressed as a measurement of the diameter of the fibers in their thread, or a denier\u2014the higher the denier, the stronger the fabric. We found 40 denier up to 150 denier to be typical for car-camping tents; you can read more about these measurements in gear manufacturer MSR\u2019s blog post and in this Outside article.\nAs for poles, Howe explained to us that each material has its advantages and drawbacks: Aluminum poles are far lighter and slide together more easily but cost more, while fiberglass-and-steel poles are often trickier to fit together and can leave splinters in your palms. They can, however, be stronger in high winds.\nEase of setup: We looked for dummy-proof tents that were intuitive to set up and that a lone person could erect fairly quickly. If you\u2019ve ever arrived at a campsite after dark with two small kids who have been stewing in the backseat for hours, you know that dealing with a tent is often a one-person job. We\u2019ve also found that a car-camping tent is the kind of item your friends may want to borrow from time to time. Those friends may well be novice campers, so we wanted something that the uninitiated but reasonably intelligent could erect, even if the original instructions had disappeared long ago. (You\u2019re going to lose the instructions. Everyone loses the instructions.)\nWe also wanted self-standing tents, which can stay up on their own. Even so, you should, ideally, stake down each corner securely; in some crowded campgrounds, however, finding a flat spot with soil soft enough to do that can be difficult. A tent that requires staking to stand up\u2014especially a larger, six-person tent\u2014is unwieldy, and it\u2019ll be impossible to set up on a hard surface such as blacktop or on raised wooden tent decks.\nIt is also important to consider the way in which the tent poles attach to the tent. Many of our picks use grommet attachments, which are more secure and simple to repair than key attachments if anything should break.\nSome of our tent picks also have guy-line systems that secure their outer rain fly\u2014although most people probably won\u2019t need to use those often. Guy-line systems are somewhat unique to each tent, with every model boasting its own specific rope bites and tie-downs. (Kit scoured YouTube tutorials and found this video to be the most informative tutorial on guy lines. With this video and a little practice, you\u2019ll soon be pitching tents like a pro.)\nAffordability: Car-camping tents should be relatively inexpensive. They don\u2019t need to be the top of the line or made of the lightest possible materials or the most advanced fabrics (something you\u2019d likely look for in a backpacking tent). We decided that the tents for this guide should not be precious items\u2014but they shouldn\u2019t be disposable, either. When we researched couples\u2019 tents in 2022, we found no tents below $150 worth considering; our cap was $400. For our 2023 family tent testing, after completing our research we realized that $500 was now the average price for a good-quality tent. Below this amount, the flaws and tradeoffs started to mount. Still, we felt that $500 was a lot to pay for a family tent, so we looked for options that were more affordable and didn\u2019t sacrifice too much.\nExtra features: Stake design, pole strength and arrangements, rain-fly tie-downs, door construction, zipper strength, and gear-loft placements all play a role in the overall comfort and enjoyment of your tent. We also considered privacy, vestibules, extra headroom, and any other bonuses.\nOnce we had our criteria nailed down, we scoured Amazon reviews of four- and six-person tents, as well as owner reviews on retailer sites such as Backcountry, Cabela\u2019s, Campmor, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Eastern Mountain Sports, L.L.Bean, and REI, plus professional reviews from GearJunkie and GearLab. We perused the lines of outdoor companies like Big Agnes, Marmot, and The North Face. And we studied the offerings of big-box stores including Costco, Sears, Target, and Walmart. We then requested test samples of the models that met our criteria and also had a consistent record of positive reviews.\nHow (and where) we tested\nFor earlier incarnations of this guide, we tested tents in Arizona (alongside Lake Mead and just south of the Hualapai reservation, near the Grand Canyon) and southern California (near Joshua Tree National Park; at the Mountain Oak Campground, an hour or so east of Los Angeles; and at Wheeler Gorge Campground, outside Ojai, California).\nAfter our longtime top-pick tent for two people ran into some stock issues in 2021, we researched new models and redesigns, and we assembled a batch of small tents for testing in March 2022, on Oahu. Over two blustery March weekends, we pitched eight tents in an exposed ocean-fronting yard on the northwestern coast of the island by Kaena Point State Park, leaving the tents up for 48 hours to face the salt air, the wind, and the rain while we tested. During this period, winds rose up to 35 to 40 knots, and we experienced passing showers as well as direct sunlight and 80-degree temperatures. To mimic heavier rain and to test the tent\u2019s ability to withstand soggy ground conditions, we also soaked our tents with a garden hose. A few weeks later, we brought the front-runners to a platform in an area that had higher elevation, near the Waianae Mountain Range, and camped out overnight in intermittent but consistent rainfall.\nIn 2022\u20132023, we tested 15 six-person tents on Oahu, pitching them once again in both coastal and higher mountain locations, where they encountered the full range of Hawaii\u2019s mercurial winter weather patterns, including winds ranging from 10 to 40 mph, passing squalls, direct sun, and good old fashioned buckets of rain. Temperatures ranged from the 50s at night to the 80s during the day.\nTo test the tents, we first opened them, splayed out their parts, and tried to put them together without consulting the instructions. We assembled and disassembled the tents on all of our testing sites multiple times. We tried the rain fly for each tent as well, one time rushing to get several of them up during an unexpected rainstorm at night. When heavy trade winds buffeted our Oahu-coast testing site, we pitched each tent in full face of the blast. We then rotated the tents looking for structural weaknesses, and we tested their guy lines and tabs to see which tents had the best and most intuitive design for withstanding wind.\nThroughout all our testing, we wanted to know how it felt to be inside the tents for long periods of time. Did we feel claustrophobic or rejuvenated? If we had to spend a day in the tent during a storm, would it be comfortable? After first removing the models that failed the structural tests, we slept, watched the stars, and ate our meals in all of the tents, as well as planned hikes from them.\nBest camping tent for two people: Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 3 Tent\nThe Mountain Hardwear Mineral King 3 Tent was the favorite tent of testers at our Oahu coastal and mountain locations. Through rainy nights and soggy mornings, on windy afternoons, and under an intense midday sun, this tent\u2019s primarily polyester mesh body, two large doors, and adaptable polyester fly kept us dry, well ventilated, and in good spirits.\nWe were surprised at first to see the Mineral King 3 come out on top because it was the smallest tent in our test group. But all our testers, including our tallest panelists, gravitated toward this tent.\nWhat sets the Mineral King 3 apart is its combination of easy setup, solid weather resistance, and livability in variable conditions. It comes with its own footprint, and is made of high-quality materials that are easy to handle. Simply put, it was the most effective, user-friendly tent in any situation we encountered. It also delivered a little something extra: Not only did the Mineral King 3 keep us sheltered in shifting weather, but key design features\u2014such as a barely-there mesh canopy, generous vestibule space, and a well-placed toggle on top of the rain fly\u2014kept us connected to the environment.\nOne night during testing, for example, clouds loomed in the distance with clear skies overhead. After we pitched the tent, the Mineral King 3\u2019s adaptable fly let us leave half the mesh dome uncovered. We watched as night fell and the first stars appeared. At the first sign of rain, it took only a few seconds\u2014and a quick hand stuck outside the tent\u2014to unfurl the fly and secure it for a dry night\u2019s sleep. When we awoke, we could roll back one part of the vestibule, make coffee, and watch the sky lighten even though it was still raining.\nDespite having the smallest capacity of the tents we tested\u201442.5 square feet\u2014the Mineral King 3 easily fits two people with a full-size mattress, or two sleeping pads, and gear. Two large vestibules add more than 40 square feet combined\u2014that is, 20.9 square feet on either side. In 2025, Mountain Hardwear released an updated version with symmetrical, instead of offset doors; we found this made it even easier to set this tent up in varying conditions, and to enter and exit.\nSetting up this tent is simple: You stake out the four corners, extend the tent\u2019s two pre-connected poles, and dock them into grommets. The tent\u2019s body attaches to the poles via plastic clips, and a third pole (the \u201cbrow\u201d) fits into two grommets sewn into a seam above the tent\u2019s two doors. These now-common clip-style setups are generally intuitive and can be accomplished in minutes. Certainly this was true of the Mineral King 3. Under good conditions one person pitched the tent in under five minutes. In high winds, it took us 10 minutes to pitch and fully secure the tent fly with extra lines and stakes.\nAll three poles\u2014two main poles and the shorter brow pole\u2014are made of strong, lightweight aluminum and come pre-bent and pre-connected. The bend in the poles has a subtle yet significant affect on the tent\u2019s structure and interior feel: As you clip the tent fabric to the poles to create the dome, bends pull the mesh outward in the head and shoulder area. Where traditional dome tents often feel cramped, the Mineral King 3 offers a little extra space. Only one other couples\u2019 tent we tested had this feature\u2014our runner-up, the Marmot Tungsten 4\u2014and we found it made both tents more livable.\nWe also appreciated the shepherd\u2019s hook stakes that come with the tent. Most of the tents we tested came with basic L-shaped stakes, which tended to spin around in the soil and slip a line. The shepherd\u2019s hook design, in contrast, held lines secure.\nUnderneath the fly, the Mineral King 3 has a full mesh dome with a waterproof, tape-seamed bathtub-style polyester floor. The overall feeling inside the tent is airy and comfortable. The tent doors are nearly wall-sized, and after you unzip them, you simply stuff them into pockets, rather than having to roll and toggle-tie the fabric. Five interior pockets plus loops for a ceiling hammock provide simple yet effective interior storage, and in 2025, Mountain Hardwear added an internal cord, useful for hanging up damp socks, or stringing up fairy lights. (The cord also helps stabilize the dome in windy conditions.)\nThe Mineral King 3\u2019s fly attaches intuitively with plastic buckles and has well-placed guy tabs. You can secure the fly to the poles with Velcro ties underneath the fly, so that the extra lines anchored the whole tent, not just the thin protective fabric, but we only needed to do so in very windy conditions. When the fly is fully deployed, the tent has two vestibules, which provide additional gear storage and also help ventilate the tent in inclement weather. And in a stroke of design brilliance, a small loop sewn into the top of the fly makes it possible to roll up one half of the fly, exposing the full mesh canopy while still providing shade and privacy.\nWhen the weather permits, it\u2019s fun to omit the fly entirely, but a word to the wise for those planning a fly-less night: Besides providing protection from rain, the fly also helps manage condensation. Though condensation (video) occurs in all conditions, it\u2019s worse when your surroundings are wet and humid, and anytime you have a large temperature difference between the inside and outside of a tent. But if your tent has a breathable inner layer, like the mesh walls of the Mineral King 3, condensation will gather on the fly instead of on the interior of the tent itself.\nAt $375, the Mineral King 3 isn\u2019t cheap. But it\u2019s one of the least expensive tents we found that had no significant drawbacks and will truly cover your bases for three-season camping. The tent also comes with its own footprint, a groundsheet that protects the tent from abrasion, which we recommend that you have.\nWeighing just 7 pounds, the tent is light enough to double for backpacking trips, especially if you divide the pieces among hikers.\nNote: The Mineral King 3 was the only tent in our test group free of fire-retardant chemicals. That means it\u2019s less likely to contain potentially hazardous materials, but it is also less fireproof than tents coated in flame retardants. As always, it\u2019s a good idea to pitch your tent far away from any open fires.\nAs of 2025, The Mineral King 3 is also free from knowingly added PFAS, a common ingredient in water repellent fabrics that has been banned in California. When we tested the PFAS-free tent against its predecessor, we found no marked difference in its ability to keep us dry.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nOur main quibble with the Mineral King 3 is that it comes with only six stakes. (Our runner-up pick comes with eight.) Six is enough to secure the tent and fly but not to fully secure the tent\u2019s extra lines in very windy conditions. This shouldn\u2019t be an issue in most situations, but if you\u2019re headed into a particularly windy place or simply want some backup, we suggest picking up four extra tent stakes at your local outdoor shop or online. These inexpensive stakes are comparable to the ones that accompany the Mineral King 3; these slightly more expensive stakes will serve you well in any car-camping terrain.\nOne other thing: Should you remove the fly, you\u2019ll also be giving up privacy\u2014something to think about if you expect to use your tent primarily in crowded campgrounds.\nSpecs\nClaimed weight (including fly, tent poles, and carry bag): 7 pounds 13.7 ounces\nClaimed packed size: 25 by 7 inches\nNumber of doors: two\nNumber of vestibules: two\nMaximum interior height: 48 inches\nTent floor area: 42.5 square feet\nFootprint included: yes\nBest camping tent for families: Kelty Wireless 6 Person Tent\nAfter researching 30 six-person tents and testing 15 side by side on a total of five trips, we chose the Kelty Wireless 6 as the best entry-level camping tent for most families. It\u2019s spacious, easy to set up, has weather protection, and is durable, all at an affordable price. The Wireless 6 lacks some of the premium materials found in pricier tents, but it features solid workmanship and should provide dependable, comfortable shelter in most three-season camping situations.\nLike our couples\u2019 tent pick, the Wireless 6 is a dome-shaped tent with a tried and true two-pole design. It has an interior footprint of 87 square feet, which sleeps four adults on single pads, or two adults and two or three children, and can accommodate a crib. It has two large doors, and a peak height of 6-foot-3. That wasn\u2019t the tallest we encountered\u2014the Eureka Copper Canyon LX 6 and the Alps Mountaineering Camp Creek 6 each topped out at 7 feet\u2014but it\u2019s enough space for most adults to maneuver standing up. The tent comes with a full rain fly that adds two vestibules for storage (each 14 square feet), totaling 115 square feet of livable space\u2014which is fairly generous yet still practical for most campsites.\nThe Wireless 6 goes up easily, using the same kind of intuitive pole and clip method as our couples\u2019 pick. The fly is equally simple to attach and orient with color-coded clips. A single person can pitch the tent in 10 to 15 minutes. (Users under 5-foot-5 may need some help fastening the highest clip. At 5-foot-3, Claire managed with a little hop.) Instead of grommets or keys, reinforced fabric sleeves hold the tent-pole ends, a particularly thoughtful feature that suits the tent\u2019s budget fiberglass-and-steel poles. This type of pole tends to be less flexible and bulkier than pricier aluminum, and it can be a pain to handle.\nLike most dome-style tents, the Wireless 6 withstands wind like a champ\u2014it fared noticeably better than the Camp Creek 6 in 15-mph gusts. The continuous curve of the dome shape allows for wind to pass over and around it. You can also get a nice cross breeze going by leaving the vestibules open. On sunny days and clear nights, take off the fly and enjoy the sky through the tent\u2019s clear mesh canopy. Some testers, though, thought the tent was stuffy when the fly was fully closed and the sun was out.\nThe Wireless 6 kept us dry in everything from scattered showers to serious downpours. As always, the vestibule is useful in rain: It gives you extra breathing room and a place to store boots\u2014or tired feet still wearing boots.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe Wireless 6\u2019s drawbacks have mainly to do with material quality. First, it uses fiberglass poles. These can be as strong, or even more so, than aluminum poles (especially cheap ones), but they\u2019re always bulkier, heavier, and not as nice to handle. However, the Wireless 6\u2019s poles were the best fiberglass ones we tested\u2014they left no splinters, unlike those on the Camp Creek 6 or the Copper Canyon LX 6.\nThough the Wireless\u2019s fly kept water out of the tent\u2019s interior, it took longer to fully dry once the rain stopped than some others we tested. It uses a 1200mm waterproof coating on 68 denier fabric, which didn\u2019t seem to bead as well as higher-rated fabrics, such as those on the The North Face Wawona 6 or the REI Co-op Base Camp 6 (each of those have 1500mm coatings). If you don\u2019t have time to let the fly dry before you pack the Wireless in its duffle, we recommend laying it out when you get home so it doesn't mildew in storage.\nWe were not particularly impressed by the quality of the Wireless 6\u2019s stakes: They felt light, and two of the eight bent during our testing. The Wireless 6 also doesn\u2019t come with a footprint, so you\u2019ll have to purchase or make that separately. But to be fair, only one six-person tent we tested comes with a footprint, and that tent costs $950!\nSpecs\nClaimed weight (including fly and tent poles): 17 pounds 3 ounces\nClaimed packed size: 27 by 8 inches\nNumber of doors: two\nNumber of vestibules: two\nMaximum interior height: 76 inches\nTent floor area: 86.9 square feet\nFootprint included: no\nRunner-up tent for two people: Marmot Tungsten 4-Person Tent\nIf the Mineral King 3 is out of stock, or if you\u2019d prefer a slightly larger tent, we also liked the Marmot Tungsten 4. The Tungsten 4 shares many of the Mineral King 3\u2019s best features, and provides 10 square feet of additional living space as well as excellent weather protection\u2014as long as you set it up properly.\nLike our top pick, the Tungsten 4 is a sturdy, two-door dome-style tent that can be deployed in about 5 minutes. It uses high-quality materials such as aluminum poles, breathable mesh, and water-resistant polyester fabric, and it comes with a full fly and a footprint. The Tungsten 4\u2019s larger size accounts for the slightly higher price tag, but campers who would like that extra room may find the expense worthwhile.\nThe Mineral King 3 and the Tungsten 4 have similar shapes, and their pitching process is nearly identical, except that the Tungsten 4 uses two brow poles instead of one. Both tents have pre-connected poles, and they use the same clipping method to attach the tent body. Marmot provides color-coded buckles to help users orient the Tungsten\u2019s fly, a feature the Mineral King 3 lacks.\nLike the Mineral King 3, the Tungsten 4 has a mesh canopy, though the opaque polyester part of its walls go higher, and provide more privacy, than the Mineral King\u2019s. Its tape-seamed bathtub floor and fly had no problem handling rain. The Tungsten\u2019s fly is not adaptable in the same way the Mineral King 3\u2019s is, but it is treated for extra UV protection, which should help lengthen the tent\u2019s lifespan.\nIn terms of how the two tents feel, the Marmot Tungsten 4 is more geared toward hunkering down and providing stalwart defense against wind, rain, and sun. In contrast to the Mineral King 3\u2019s triangular vestibules, the Tungsten 4\u2019s vestibules open via a central door with protected areas on either side. This design does a better job shielding the tent from incoming\u2014and sideways\u2014wind and rain, and the Tungsten\u2019s two brow poles create an effective awning over the tent door, but the tent feels more enclosed than the Mineral King.\nMarmot uses color coding to help you position the tent as well as set it up. Both of the doors zip open to the side that\u2019s color-coded blue, as opposed to zipping open to opposite sides. This means the vestibules equally protect the doors, rather than providing opposite entries and exits\u2014the latter creates a situation where, in stormy weather, one side of the tent is always more exposed to blustering wind or rain. In other words, one partner\u2014or one partner\u2019s gear\u2014is always going to get a dose of weather when they head out. The Tungsten 4 design equalizes exposure and protection.\nLike our top pick, the Tungsten 4 comes with a footprint. Unlike our top pick, the Tungsten 4 is coated with flame retardants.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIn the current version of the Marmot Tungsten 4, we noticed a weakness in the tent\u2019s pole design absent in earlier versions of the tent: Without the fly, the tent\u2019s poles were stable in windy conditions. But with the added weight of the fly, the poles sometimes twisted, causing the tent to accordion inward and lose its shape wherever it was most exposed. If we Velcroed the fly directly to the poles in these areas\u2014as the directions say to\u2014the tent regained its structural integrity.\nWe suspect that the bends in the current Tungsten\u2019s poles, which are lower to the ground than in the Mineral King 3\u2019s poles, are too acute. (Neither the Mineral King 3 nor any straight-poled dome tent we tested collapsed in this way.)\nAlso, like the Mineral King 3, this tent is short on stakes. Ideally, Marmot would provide another six, in addition to the eight that come with it.\nSpecs\nClaimed minimum weight (including fly and tent poles): 7 pounds 15 ounces\nClaimed packed size: 24.8 by 8.3 inches\nNumber of doors: two\nNumber of vestibules: two\nMaximum interior height: 52 inches\nTent floor area: 52.7 square feet\nFootprint included: yes\nBest budget tent: Coleman Sundome 6-Person Tent\nThe square footprint, ample windows, and functional fly of the Coleman Sundome 6-Person Tent make it a good choice for occasional or backyard campers who want an inexpensive tent that is easy to put up, and looks and feels reasonably nice to camp in.\nUnlike some cheap tents we\u2019ve tested over the years, the Coleman Sundome has a simple shape and pole design that should be easy for even inexperienced campers to figure out. The base is a square: Two identical fiberglass poles feed through sleeves on the tent roof to form an X. Pegs at the corners of the tent slip into the ends of the poles, and then the dome-shaped tent pops up (video).\nThe separate fly, which covers the upper half of the tent, uses a third, shorter \u201cbrow\u201d pole to form protective peaks over the door and the back window. In our tests, an experienced camper took only about six minutes on the first try to set up the tent body alone and stake it out. Getting the fly placed and staked properly took about five more minutes. That\u2019s pretty fast.\nMeasuring 10 by 10 feet, the Sundome covers an area larger than that of our family-tent top pick though its lower roof leaves it with less headroom. (The Sundome\u2019s center height is exactly six feet, while the Wireless 6 and The North Face Wawona 6 each reach six-foot-four.)\nLike the REI Co-op Base Camp tents, the Sundome combines high polyester walls with mesh higher up to facilitate stargazing, should you use the tent without the fly, without sacrificing privacy (two of the four walls have mesh from about thigh height up to the roof). That mesh also keeps the tent feeling airy and cool in hot climates.\nThe biggest material difference between the Sundome and our other picks is its crunchy, tarp-like polyethylene floor. The other tents in this guide all have bathtub-style tape-seamed polyester floors, which is the standard among high-quality tents. The Sundome\u2019s tarp is clearly a budget material, but for what it was, we found it user-friendly. It\u2019s easy to mop up after wet paws and spills, and it doesn\u2019t hold moisture. It\u2019s unlikely to be as durable, though, as the softer, stronger polyester found in our other picks.\nColeman makes no dedicated footprints for its tents\u2014the idea being that the polyethylene is tough enough not to need one. (Still, we suggest that you buy a groundsheet.) The tent has a loop at the ceiling center to hang a small, lightweight light, and also comes with a little doormat. The Sundome weighs just 16 pounds, less than any other family tent we tested for this guide.\nAlthough our test tent lasted through two moderate showers with no leaking, be aware that a couple of Amazon buyers have experienced leaking in rainstorms and poles breaking in high winds. When it comes to tents, you tend to get pretty close to what you pay for. If you\u2019re likely to be camping in downpours or high winds, don\u2019t rely on a sub-$150 tent.\nAs of 2025, versions of the Sundome are available on Amazon that both do and do not contain knowingly added PFAS. We will be testing the PFAS-free version of this tent soon, and will report back.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThe Sundome has only one door, which can be inconvenient, especially for someone trying to slip out of the tent without waking anyone, and it only has two small internal pockets, fewer than any of our other picks.\nAlthough our test tent lasted through two moderate showers with no leaking, be aware that a couple of Amazon buyers have experienced leaking in rainstorms.\nSpecs\nClaimed weight (including fly and tent poles): 16 pounds\nClaimed packed size: 23.89 by 6.22 inches\nNumber of doors: one\nNumber of vestibules: none\nMaximum interior height: 72 inches\nTent floor area: 100 square feet\nFootprint included: no\nUpgrade tent for families: North Face Wawona 6 Tent\nIf you can afford to spend more on a family tent, we recommend The North Face Wawona 6. Everyone who tested this tent loved it, and it\u2019s not hard to understand why. With plenty of interior space, near-vertical walls, and a gigantic vestibule that could accommodate a golf cart, the Wawona feels more like a tiny home than a tent.\nAt $550, this modified dome-style tent isn\u2019t cheap, but it represents substantial value. Many tents with similar profiles\u2014such as the (since discontinued) Big Agnes Dog House 6\u2014either cost more or require you buy the tent body and attachable vestibule separately. The Wawona doesn\u2019t come with a footprint\u2014few tents this size do\u2014but it\u2019s otherwise all-inclusive, and it is compact considering how much livable space you get. The price also reflects the high quality of the materials, such as the four reinforced aluminum poles, which weigh little yet result in a remarkably strong tent.\nThe Wawona 6 is more complex to set up than a classic dome-style tent like the Wireless 6, but not by much. We recommend doing it with two people, but one person can manage in about 15 minutes. As with any free-standing tent, with this one you stake out the four corners, and then you feed the two main tent poles through the Wawona\u2019s fabric sleeves, which go halfway down the tent\u2019s body. The North Face\u2019s color-coded poles make this process easy to navigate. Orienting the fly took us a minute on our first try. (We were stubborn and didn\u2019t look at the instructions.) Once you identify the front and back, the process is straightforward. The fly goes up and over the tent body, covering only the upper half of the mesh dome, and then forms the glorious vestibule with the aid of a third pole. Use the extra stakes and guy-lines provided to stabilize the vestibule as much as you need.\nOnce you set up the Wawona 6, you may not want to leave. Adults as tall as 6-foot-3 can move about this tent standing upright. With a 44-square-foot vestibule, and 86 square feet of interior living space, the tent has plenty of room to house beds, cribs, gear, pets, and camping furniture. Zippered doors can enclose the vestibule fully, so it serves as a separate room for the tent, or you can leave one or both open, so the vestibule can act like a porch or mudroom. The main tent body has a giant front door that\u2019s oriented to make entry and exit easy for all the tent\u2019s occupants at night, and a smaller back window that doubles as a second door.\nThe Wawona 6\u2019s side-walls are high and straight, but the structure stays very stable in wind thanks to a final pole that wraps around the front and sides\u2014and thanks to the absence of any acute angles in the poles. We were skeptical about the vestibule\u2019s ability to handle wind, since it\u2019s big and supported by a single pole, but it stood fast in 30 mph oceanside gusts and 15 mph hilltop winds.\nThe Wawona did equally well in rain. Its walls are 75-denier polyester fabric (tougher than the Wireless 6\u2019s 68-denier polyester and the same as the REI Co-op Base Camp\u2019s) that extends about two-thirds up the tent\u2019s sides, and then is topped with mesh. The partial fly does a great job of keeping rain out of the upper, mesh areas, and cleverly placed vents maintain airflow so it never feels too stuffy. (You can also roll up the fly on the two sides to expose the mesh and let in more light.) Thanks to the high opaque walls, users have the privacy to change standing upright and plenty of storage options to stash their gear, including ceiling pockets and a three-pocket back window organizer.\nThe Wawona 6 uses no flame retardants, and its fabrics are free from knowingly added PFAS. This is great for avoiding potential exposure to hazardous chemicals, but you should pitch the tent well away from any open flames.\nThe North Face offers a limited lifetime warranty on the tent, and will repair most flaws and damage at its discretion.\nSome campers might find the Wawona 6\u2019s footprint unwieldy in smaller campsites, or they might simply prefer a tent with a more straightforward design. If you want a six-person tent made with high-quality materials but a traditional profile, we recommend the similarly priced Big Agnes Spicer Peak 6, or Nemo\u2019s Aurora Highrise 6. MSR\u2019s Habitude 6 is also a good tent, but it costs about $200 more. Unfortunately, you have to buy a separate groundsheet for the Wawona 6 and for most other tents its size as well.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nSome campers might find the Wawona 6\u2019s footprint unwieldy in smaller campsites, or they might simply prefer a tent with a more straightforward design.

After many hours of testing, we found that the Base Camps\u2019 reinforced four-pole structure and ultra-spacious interior and vestibules made them the most sturdy, flexible, and reliable models in our test group.\nSuperior vestibule space helped both the Base Camp 4 and the Base Camp 6 rise to the top of their respective test groups. On the Base Camp 4, the two vestibules (front and rear) add up to 44 square feet (the area of the tent itself is 60 square feet). That\u2019s the most of any couples\u2019 tents we tested. As for the Base Camp 6, the vestibule area covered by its front fly and rear fly is also 44 square feet (the interior measures 84 square feet). Only one six-person tent we tested had a larger vestibule: the Nemo Aurora Highrise 6. (The Big Agnes Big House 6 and the REI Co-op Wonderland 6 also have large vestibules, but you must purchase them separately, for an extra $200 and $125, respectively.)\nThe Base Camp tents include a low side vent and multiple stuff pockets on the walls and ceiling, which are made of 75D polyester treated with 1500mm of polyurethane waterproofing. Note that these tents are strictly meant for car camping; the Base Camp 4 and the Base Camp 6 weigh 17 and 21 pounds, respectively, so you won\u2019t want to carry either one very far. Both come with storage sacks that you sling over one shoulder.\nBoth Base Camp tents have two doors and lots of mesh in the main tent body. But unlike the Mineral King 3 and the Tungsten 4, the mesh on each Base Camp tent starts high on the walls\u2014more than 4 feet from the ground. This design is a big plus for people who regularly camp in crowded campgrounds and don\u2019t like to get naked in front of strangers. And you can unzip the front door, remove it, and neatly stash it into one of the tent\u2019s internal pockets\u2014a useful feature if you\u2019re feeling sociable.\nThe geodesic structure of the Base Camp tents is built to withstand wind and rain. It has two main poles that thread through sleeves, stretching between the four corners of the tent. Generally, we like clip-on designs better, since those are easier to put together, but in the case of the Base Camp models, the sleeves add extra tension and stability throughout the tent fabric. There are also two poles that arch over each doorway and down the sides of the tent to add extra shape and support; these attach to the tent body with clips. The rain fly has an additional tent pole, too, to support the vestibule. Overall, these poles\u2014all of them aluminum\u2014contribute to a particularly sturdy structure, with or without the rain fly. During our testing, our Base Camp shrugged off both a rainstorm and a desert windstorm as if they were nothing.\nIf anything happens to your Base Camp, REI\u2019s warranty and replacement program has an impressive reputation. Kit lived in the 2013 version of the larger Base Camp 6 for seven months, and it stayed up the entire time, with the tent poles under constant tension\u2014that is, until two of the poles snapped within a week of each other. After a short phone call, REI offered Kit a full replacement. (This was before Kit started reviewing tents for Wirecutter, so REI didn\u2019t know who he was.)\nIn 2024, REI Co-op released an updated version of the Base Camp 4/6 that uses fabrics that are free from knowingly added PFAS, and features redesigned fly doors. Instead of zipping open on one side, the doors have two straight-up-and-down zippers on either side so tent dwellers can come and go with greater versatility. The tent fly also now has four vents instead of two. We found it did a better job distributing air flow during testing than the fly from the previous version, increasing the tent\u2019s comfort in warmer weather.\nThe tents\u2019 PFAS-free water repellent fabric kept us dry in sprinkler and hose tests, but we plan to put it through further stormy weather testing soon.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nUnlike with our top and runner-up picks for couples you have to purchase a footprint for your Base Camp 4 tent separately, as well as for the Base Camp 6. REI makes dedicated ones for both the Base Camp 4 and the Base Camp 6.\nWith a six-foot-two maximum height, the Base Camp 6 offers a little less headroom compared with the Kelty Wireless 6 and The North Face Wawona 6, both of which measure six-foot-four in height.\nSpecs\nBase Camp 4:\nClaimed weight (including fly and tent poles): 17 pounds 5.6 ounces\nClaimed packed size: 20 by 10 inches\nNumber of doors: two\nNumber of vestibules: two\nMaximum interior height: 63 inches\nTent floor area: 59 square feet\nFootprint included: no\nBase Camp 6:\nClaimed weight (including fly and tent poles): 20 pounds 11.5 ounces\nClaimed packed size: 24 by 11 inches\nNumber of doors: two\nNumber of vestibules: two\nMaximum interior height: 74 inches\nTent floor area: 84 square feet\nFootprint included: no\nOther tents worth considering\nTents for couples (that is, four-person tents)\nIf you need to save money and don\u2019t need two doors: Try the Kelty Grand Mesa 4. When we first tested tents in 2016, the Grand Mesa was one of the few tents with a large mesh canopy. As this design became more common, the Kelty tent became less unusual and ultimately couldn\u2019t compete with two-door models, which are more convenient for couples and have better ventilation. We think our top pick is a more well-rounded choice, but if you\u2019re looking for a reasonably priced tent that\u2019s just as easy to pitch, and you\u2019re not fussed about having two doors, the Kelty Grand Mesa 4 is a good choice. It comes with a full rain fly but no footprint.\nIf you\u2019re a couple and want a tent that you can (probably) stand up in: Try the North Face Wawona 4. This is a scaled-down version of our upgrade pick tent for families. We had liked the previous version of this tent; in 2024, North Face switched the nylon it had been using to a polyester ripstop, and we like the new version even more. It stands over six feet high\u2014more than a full foot taller than our couple\u2019s pick from Marmot. This means we could walk straight into it, no stooping required. High walls with mesh windows at the top lend privacy, a plus at more crowded campsites or for campers who prefer a sense of enclosure. Its jutting front vestibule also gave us extra elbow room while laying out sleeping pads and bags. One caveat: Although its height did make the tent feel quite expansive inside, it also made setting up the tent solo difficult for our five-foot-five tester. Once she had her companion assist with holding the other end of the poles, though, it was quick to put up. In addition, a tester of the previous model found that the Wawona 4\u2019s higher profile caused some difficulties while setting it up in the wind. However, in our latest tests\u2014despite some breezy summer nights at a very full and active campground (with several bear visitors roaming around)\u2014the tent felt secure and stable inside. It comes with a rain fly and no footprint.\nTents for families (that is, six-person tents)\nIf the Coleman Sundome 6 is out of stock: Try the Core 6 Person Straight Wall Cabin Tent. Core Equipment is a relatively new company, popular on Amazon, whose products seem designed to compete directly with products from Coleman, an outdoor legacy brand that has been around 1900. We tested Core\u2019s basic six-person dome-style and cabin-style tents, and each performed as well as the Coleman tent did. (The Core 6 Person Dome Tent that we tested has since been replaced by Core\u2019s 6 Person Dome Plus Tent, which we plan to take a look at.) We can\u2019t yet speak for the long-term durability of the tent\u2014or the company\u2014which is why we\u2019re not making it our budget pick, but we\u2019ll continue testing it.\nIf The North Face Wawona 6 is out of stock: Try the Big Agnes Spicer Peak 6 or the Nemo Aurora Highrise 6. Both of these tents are well-structured, dome-style tents with high-quality workmanship and design. We preferred the single huge vestibule of the Wawona 6 to the smaller front and back vestibules on these two tents, but either tent would be a good runner-up. Both contain about 83 square feet of space, but the Aurora has more of a bread-loaf shape with two big doors running lengthwise\u2014great for kids who want to run in and out\u2014and a peak height of six-foot-five, while the Spicer Peak has doors at the narrower ends, and a peak height of six-foot-eight.\nFor longer stays or families with older kids: Try the REI Co-op Wonderland 6 Tent. This is the redesign of REI Co-op\u2019s beloved Kingdom 6 tent, which was a favorite among many family campers, including Wirecutter\u2019s deputy editor Christine Cyr Clisset. Like the old Kingdom, the Wonderland is a delightful wagon-shaped tent with two round doors on either end. It has a massive interior, and comes with a room divider for privacy, good for families with older kids. REI Co-op changed the Wonderland\u2019s pole design to increase its stability in wind, a weakness of the old Kingdom. We don\u2019t yet know how well it stands up over time, but it handled 35 mph winds on the North Shore of Oahu without a problem. The tent has a partial fly and lots of interior storage, but no vestibule\u2014and it costs a hefty $600. You can purchase an attachable mudroom for an additional $125; this substantially increases the footprint of an already large tent if you\u2019re headed to a campsite with limited space.\nIf you want something that goes up instantly: Try the Coleman 6-Person Instant Cabin, which, thanks to telescoping, pre-attached poles, goes up and comes down much faster (in less than two minutes) than any other tent we tested. It also has no standalone fly, instead relying on a solid roof, which helps make setup easier. The drawback here is that this tent offers less protection from the elements and does less to reduce condensation than models with a separate fly. Although we were impressed by the Instant Cabin\u2019s ease of setup, we thought that it was darker and less well ventilated than the Coleman Sundome 6-Person Tent.\nThe competition\nTents for couples (that is, four-person tents)\nAlps Mountaineering Meramac 4-Person: Though this tent was sturdy (its poles were much heavier and of better quality than some of the other fiberglass poles we saw), it has no vestibule, and it didn\u2019t offer as good ventilation as our picks when fully closed.\nEureka Kohana 4 Person Tent: The poles were finicky to insert and left the tent looking decidedly off-kilter.\nColeman 4-Person Pop-Up Tent: The Pop-Up Tent is packed into a 3-foot-wide carrying case that, when opened, shoots the tent forth like a snake-in-a-can gag gift. Presto\u2014there\u2019s your tent. The only problem is that it\u2019s not a very good tent\u2014only for backyard duty at best. Also, packing the tent back up is a nightmare.\nBig Agnes Big House 4: This is a cabin-style tent that we tested as a control; we wanted to know whether a dome-style tent was really better than a cabin-style tent for two people. Though this tent offered a little more livable space, the broad, flat walls had some trouble during high winds.\nColeman Sundome 4-Person Tent: We recommend this tent in its six-person design, but the four-person model we tested was too weak to support itself when subjected to even mild wind or rain.\nWe dismissed several tents because their fiberglass poles were too flimsy to offer support against anything but the lightest breeze: the Amazon Basics Outdoor 4-Person Camping Tent, and the Coleman Hooligan 4-Person Backpacking Tent.\nTents for families (that is, six-person tents)\nREI Co-op Skyward 6 Tent: This did perform well overall for a cabin-style tent, but like many of its brethren, it didn\u2019t handle wind well, and we didn\u2019t like how much we had to wrestle its poles to dock them during setup.\nALPS Mountaineering Camp Creek 6: This spacious cabin-style tent met its downfall the same way almost every other cabin-style tent we tested did\u2014in wind. Its fiberglass-and-steel tent poles also left splinters in our palms.\nMountain Hardwear Bridger 6: What is a $950 six-person tent like? Quite nice, unsurprisingly. The Bridger 6 is the only six-person tent we encountered that can actually house six people, it\u2019s made of high-quality polyester, and it has powder-coated aluminum poles and endless storage options. It features a large front-facing porch-style vestibule, which can accommodate a table and multiple chairs without blocking the entry. It was also the only six-person tent we saw that came with a groundsheet. But the tent\u2019s striking sea-foam green walls show every scuff and mark\u2014not in the least practical for camping with kids. When we pitched the tent alongside our upgrade pick, we still gravitated to the Wawona\u2019s more versatile vestibule. Also, $950.\nBig Agnes Big House 6: Although we liked the look and feel of this brightly colored tent, it costs $600 and the vestibule is a separate purchase ($200), making the full package significantly more pricey than our family-tent picks.\nWe\u2019ve also tested and dismissed tents from Cabela\u2019s, Eureka, MSR, Sierra Designs, and Stoic that have since been discontinued; Eureka has since gone out of business.\nCare, use, and maintenance\nWe found that company representatives are reluctant to estimate the lifespan of their tents. When pushed, most of the reps we talked to estimated five to 10 years, though the actual lifespan will vary widely depending on care and frequency of use. In conducting research for this guide, we heard multiple tales of careful campers who had been using the same tent for 15 years or more.\nThere are several straightforward ways to make any tent last longer:\n- Use a groundsheet. A footprint made by the same company that made your tent and that\u2019s sized to match is ideal to prevent pooling water\u2014and to avoid the wrinkles and crumply sound of a cheap, $10 tarp. That said, a cheap tarp will do the job just fine, as long as you buy it or cut it to fit. A tarp that\u2019s too big will collect rainwater off the fly and funnel it right under the tent.\n- Clean your campsite. Before you lay out your footprint and tent, make a reasonable effort to remove from the site any small stones, sticks, and briars that could puncture the tent floor.\n- Set some ground rules. \u201cYour tent is your sanctuary,\u201d said camping expert Helen Olsson, who would always bring a \u201cplay tent\u201d (an old, two-person backpacking tent) for her little kids to use as a daytime play space. When they were in the \u201creal\u201d tent, everyone followed Olsson\u2019s \u201cno shoes in the tent\u201d rule.\n- Zip it up. Similarly, keep your tent zipped to keep bugs and critters out, and become a pro zipper user: A thumb placed in the area forward of the direction you\u2019re pulling the zipper will clear the fabric path and help prevent snags.\n- Sweep out before packing. Tiny pebbles or sticks packed inside the tent can rub and erode the material over time. Another nice thing about tents that retain their structure without being staked is that a couple of people should be able to team up to lift the tent and shake out detritus before removing the poles and putting the tent away. You could also follow the lead of some campers and carry a small whisk broom and dustpan to keep the tent floor tidy during your trip.\n- Dry before storing. \u201cNothing will destroy a tent faster than mildew,\u201d tent designer Bob Howe told us. \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t destroy it, it just makes it unlivable.\u201d To avoid mildew (and the accompanying stink), never, ever pack away a tent that\u2019s still damp. Line-dry it, hang it up in your basement, or set it up in your garage until any hint of dampness is gone.\nThis article was edited by Eve O\u2019Neill and Christine Ryan.\nSources\nBob Howe, tent designer, phone interview, March 10, 2016\nHelen Olsson, author of The Down and Dirty Guide to Camping with Kids, phone interview, March 10, 2016\nRyan Flynn, salesperson for Johnson Outdoors, parent company of Eureka, phone interview, March 7, 2016\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "The Best Beach and Surf Gear: Towels, Totes, Coolers, and More\nThere are always two beaches \u2014 the one you imagine and the one you end up on. Somehow the sun is always hotter, the sand more persistent, and the towels less inviting than you remember them being.\nBut with a little preparation, you can close that gap between fantasy and reality. We\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours researching and testing the best towels, chairs, sunscreens, and other gear to make your next trip to the water as fun and relaxing as possible.\nHow we picked and tested\nIf you\u2019ve ever traveled to the beach and been at least partly responsible for gear, comfort, and fun, you know that relaxing in the sand takes hard work. We\u2019ve spent almost a decade on beaches all over Hawaii, California, and South Carolina, digging in the sand and running out into the surf.\nIn 2025 three Wirecutter staffers and a group of eight testers, from kids to adults, ventured to several Hawaiian beaches over the course of three days to update our testing. We hauled and pitched sun shades and umbrellas. We packed beach totes, towed coolers, laid out (and on) beach towels, flew kites, paddled balls, and threw frisbees and \u2026 flungles.\nBut before all this fun in the sun, we spent a solid week on research to find the best-quality gear to test. For all of the items we recommend in this guide, there are hundreds that we decided weren\u2019t worth our time (or your money).\nBeach towels\nThe Brooklinen Beach Towel measures 34 by 70 inches, and it has a velour face on one side, which has a soft and velvety feel, and an absorbent terry weave on the back. Made in Portugal, this heavy-weight towel is rated 550 grams per square meter \u2014 100 GSM more than most medium-weight towels we tested. Most towels range from 300 to 900 GSM, and anything above 600 is considered premium. We could feel this heavier weight in our hands and when the towel was draped over our bodies \u2014 it\u2019s a pleasure. That said, the Brooklinen Beach Towel is three times the price of the Turkish towel we recommend, and it\u2019s an extra luxury that may not be that important to everyone. Ultimately, this remains a block of woven cotton that you spread out on the sand. But what a towel!\nIf the Brooklinen Beach Towel is out of stock, try the L.L.Bean Seaside Beach Towel. It\u2019s a medium-weight towel, measuring 450 GSM (100 GSM less than our top pick), and our testers enjoyed the feel of its fluffy cotton. It absorbs water very well and remains soft even after multiple washes. Its sewn edge is resistant to fraying.\nOne downside to large towels like our picks from Brooklinen or L.L.Bean is they take up a lot of space in a bag. If you prefer a smaller, lightweight beach towel, the cotton Huckberry Mediterranean Turkish Towel is a terrific, inexpensive option (and it\u2019s good for travel).\nThe Huckberry towels are Oeko-Tex\u2013certified, which means they should be free of potentially harmful substances, such as heavy metals, formaldehyde, and plasticizers. One thing to be aware of: Staff members who\u2019ve followed the slightly persnickety care instructions (wash on gentle cycle in cold water with very little detergent and no softener, and, if possible, air-dry) report no pilling. However, one staff member treats her Huckberry towels like regular towels (aka, she gives them no special treatment), and she says they pilled slightly after just a few washes.\nHowever, if none of these towels works for you, we have other options in our full guide to beach towels.\nMade from 100% Turkish cotton, the Sand Cloud Terra Hooded Poncho Youth has a terry-cloth interior that improves absorption and drying. The slightly oversized hood is roomy enough to protect young faces from the sun, and the side pockets are great for securing knickknacks. It conveniently turns a towel into a wrap that you can put on young bodies determined to wriggle free of everything.\nInfant sand barrier\nAs great as it is to lie on a towel in the sand, it\u2019s not the best when you\u2019re trying to manage babies on the beach. The Sandy Bumz Outdoor Picnic Ground Cover is a simple, hexagonally shaped polyester sheet. It\u2019s 7 feet across, with an 8-inch-high semirigid frame around the edge that acts as a small barrier for debris. (The frame\u2019s wall is light enough that it won\u2019t hurt if you fall on it, but it is strong enough to remain rigid in the wind.) When you\u2019re packing up, the mat bends into a kind of origami shape, about 10 by 34 inches. Though nothing will keep sand completely at bay, the Sandy Bumz cover is a simple piece of gear that can quickly create a relatively clean space on the beach.\nSunshade and beach umbrella\nThe Sun Ninja Beach Tent 4 Person is an expanse of sun-resistant (UPF 50+) spandex that stretches from its sand-ballasted corners across four vertical aluminum-tube poles, providing enough shade for four adults. Several other companies make shades similar to this model, but the Sun Ninja tent is our pick because it\u2019s simple to set up, it works in calm and windy conditions, and it provides plenty of shade without blocking too much of your view.\nThe Sun Ninja tent will not last forever. Constant exposure to the sun will, over the years, break down the spandex cover. The Sun Ninja Tent has a one-year warranty \u2014 standard for shades of this type \u2014 but we\u2019ve found some noticeable stretch in the material after three years of near-constant use in Hawaii. If you go to the beach only a few times each summer, you probably won\u2019t notice too much. However, if you go to the beach frequently, you may prefer one of our more robust picks in our full guide to beach shelters and umbrellas.\nIt seems that everyone I know has at least one story of a classic beach umbrella getting caught in the wind and flying down the beach. Thankfully, you can rest easy with the BeachBUB All-In-One Beach Umbrella System.\nIt can be a little fiddly to set up the small tarp and sand anchor system, but once in place, the BeachBUB umbrella is rated for winds up to 30 miles per hour. Under normal conditions, the umbrella feels more like a statue than a beach shade. It\u2019s simply a very secure-feeling piece of equipment to settle under.\nBeach chair\nIf you want to soak up the rays while reclining with a cold one, get the Tommy Bahama Backpack Beach Chair. Its built-in padded backpack straps make it simple to carry down to the beach. You can easily adjust the chair between five seated positions while you\u2019re sitting (just lift the handles, move them forward or back, and lock them back in place). Sturdy canvas backing makes the chair comfortable \u2014 and strong enough to hold 300 pounds. This chair also features a pillow, a large zippered pocket, a cupholder, and a cooler on the back (which fits up to six 12-ounce cans).\nTommy Bahama makes an alternate, less expensive version of the backpack beach chair, which has plastic, not wooden, arms \u2014 you can find it at Costco and other retailers. An ever-so-slightly larger, pricier deluxe version, which has an extra armrest pouch, is also available on the Tommy Bahama site. We recommend all three versions and suggest choosing whichever\u2019s available and within your budget.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something higher off the ground, or sturdier, see our full guide to beach chairs.\nBeach totes\nThe L.L.Bean Boat and Tote is best for lugging all your stuff to and from the beach. It\u2019s made of heavyweight, 24-ounce canvas, which helps it weather the elements (though it\u2019s not water-resistant) and allows it to stand up like a bucket \u2014 even when empty. In this bag, your valuables will be kept from prying eyes as well as protected from sand and water. The Boat and Tote features a reinforced bottom and overlapped, double-stitched seams made with nylon thread, which can resist rot better than cheap cotton.\nIt doesn\u2019t have additional pockets or zippers, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. Pockets fill with sand. And as Wirecutter founder Brian Lam discovered after casting aside six different zippered bags, zippers (unless specifically designed for salt-heavy environments) oxidize and seize up quickly in ocean air. (But if you still demand closure, the Boat and Tote is available with a zippered top.) This bag ships for free and is protected by L.L.Bean\u2019s somewhat limited satisfaction guarantee for a year.\nThe Yeti Camino 35 Carryall Tote Bag is constructed from the same material that made the Yeti Panga Waterproof Duffel such an obvious pick for a waterproof duffel bag. The trademarked ThickSkin shell is a high-density nylon coated in thick, waterproof materials that shed water and grime \u2014 it feels not dissimilar to a rain boot, except it\u2019s more malleable. The bottom is made via EVA foam injection molding, which is a fancy way of saying this bag stands upright even while empty, so it\u2019s easier to load and unload.\nWe\u2019ve been somewhat skeptical about Yeti equipment over the years \u2014 not because it isn\u2019t built well or doesn\u2019t live up to the hype, but because it comes with a high price. That said, after years of testing Yeti gear, we can\u2019t deny how long-lasting and tough it almost always is. If you\u2019re hard on your gear or you lean toward more-adventurous outings, this may be a bag to consider.\nIf neither of these bags are quite right for you, check out our full guide to beach bags.\nBeach cart\nThe best beach carts should move well across most types of sand, be sturdy enough to carry a full cooler and other beach supplies, and ideally fold up so they can fit in the trunk of your car or bed of a pickup. The Mac Sports Heavy Duty Collapsible Folding All Terrain Utility Cart is that beach cart. The 4-inch-wide plastic wheels are large enough to displace and roll across most beaches and dirt trails. But they aren\u2019t great in very loose sand, and they have poor traction across cement \u2014 think of a kid\u2019s plastic bike skidding around on a sidewalk.\nA fair warning: The Mac Sports cart is heavy. The whole thing, steel frame and all, weighs 24.5 pounds, and for some people it can be a little unwieldy (even when folded up). But the weight is what makes the cart so sturdy and able to carry an impressive amount across long distances, without straining you or the cart. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried a product in a long time that I was so stoked on immediately,\u201d said Carl Olsen, the recently retired surfboard shaper and owner of Two Crows Surfboards in Hawaii. He noted that he liked how easily it moved over rough terrain. \u201cWith a normal wagon you have to watch the bumps and cracks and make sure to stay on the pavement.\u201d\nCoolers\nMany of the wheeled coolers we\u2019ve tested over the years are let down by either their wheels or their handles. Most people do not need a bear-proof, roto-molded cooler, but if you want a cooler that rolls around on wheels, none of them are as well made as the Yeti Tundra Haul Hard Cooler. The arm is made from a thick-gauge welded aluminum, the quality of which you can feel immediately when you lift it. The wheels are a single-construction plastic and not hollow or feeble-feeling, like those of so many other coolers.\nRemarkably, when we lifted this cooler up by the handle \u2014 fully loaded with cans, food, and many pounds of ice \u2014 it didn\u2019t feel that different from wheeling around a high-end piece of luggage. We found the Tundra Haul Wheeled Cooler to be very nimble, especially considering that it weighs 37 pounds by itself.\nThe Yeti Hopper M20 Backpack Soft Cooler is a good option if you need a backpack that can last longer than any other soft cooler available. Like all Yeti gear, the Hopper backpack verges on being overengineered for strength and durability. From the TPU-laminated nylon (which makes it waterproof and tough as nails) to the bar-tack stitching (the zigzag stitching reinforcing the shoulder straps, which increases the bag\u2019s integrity under weight), everything on this bag is designed to last for years, through some of the toughest conditions you\u2019ll encounter. The interior is insulated by closed-cell foam and secured with a magnetic roll-top lid. It\u2019s not as tough as our hard-cooler picks, but it\u2019s the toughest soft cooler we\u2019ve tried.\nIf none of these coolers works for you, we have other options in our full guide to coolers.\nSunglasses\nThe Goodr OG are versatile, unisex sunglasses that look good on almost any face, regardless of size or shape. They\u2019re a riff on the classic design of the Ray-Ban Wayfarer, and they were the most widely liked of all the sunglasses we tested in this style. They\u2019re comfortable and UV-protected and polarized, and they feel durable. For the price, the Goodr glasses are a solid value, with a simple shape that feels built to last. Goodr offers only a 30-day return window, but the glasses have a year-long warranty.\nIf the Goodr sunglasses aren\u2019t quite right but you don\u2019t want to splash out on shades, see our full guide to cheap sunglasses for more options.\nThe Ombraz Classic Sunglasses have a regular frame that\u2019s secured around your head by two strands of connected nylon cord rather than by two arms that go over your ears. They\u2019re ideal for plenty of beach activities that require movement. The lenses are scratch-resistant, with UV protection.\nWe\u2019ve used these sunglasses for a few years now, for everything from picking up trash to playing games on the beach, and we enjoy how secure they feel, even as we stoop to gather things. However, the Ombraz sunglasses are significantly more expensive than the Goodr OG sunglasses, and they\u2019re something of a commitment. If, like some of us, you are prone to losing things, the cost may be prohibitive. A bit of anecdotal testing here, but every time I\u2019ve pulled these out around very active people \u2014 paddle-boarding, canoe-surfing types \u2014 they almost immediately ask me where to find them.\nFlip-flops\nThere\u2019s no reason to bring your best sandals to the beach. This is especially true if you\u2019re going on vacation and you don\u2019t want to pack heavy or bulky sandals. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s Indosole Essntls Flip Flops offer the best combination of quality, discreet looks, easy packability, and responsible manufacturing from recycled materials. Indosole is a Certified B Corporation, so everything about its impact \u2014 whether environmental or social or labor-related \u2014 is scored and monitored. Though the sandals can feel a little stiff for some people, we\u2019ve found that they break in well enough after a few outings.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a sandal that will mold to your feet and look better and better with age, few options are as good as a classic pair of women\u2019s or men\u2019s Rainbow Sandals Single Layer Luxury Leather flip-flops. Close your eyes and imagine a classic leather sandal: a simple shape, with a single leather strap that won\u2019t break free after you\u2019ve walked a few miles. What you\u2019re imagining is a pair of Rainbow Sandals. It has been that way since 1974. In Hawaii, I wear these year-round, year after year, and they only get more comfortable the more I wear them.\nStraw and sun hats\nThe Sunday Afternoons Sun Guardian Hat provides more protection than most straw hats, thanks to the dark fabric underside of its brim, which stops UV rays from reflecting into your face, and the strip of cloth lining the hat\u2019s crown, which blocks sun from your scalp. The Sun Guardian Hat falls short of the UV protection of our sun hat picks, but those styles aren\u2019t for everyone, and ultimately wearing a hat with flaws is better than no hat at all.\nThe Sunday Afternoons Ultra Adventure Hat is made of a nylon and polyester blend rated UPF 50+, the highest possible protection level. Its 3.25-inch clamshell brim (the longest brim of our sun hat picks) and flowing neck skirt provide generous coverage of the face, ears, neck, and upper shoulders. In windy conditions, the stiff brim stays put and continues to provide protection, and a chin strap ensures that the hat doesn\u2019t fly off your head.\nSunscreen\nIf you\u2019re headed on a reef-themed scuba or snorkel excursion \u2014 or even just to a beach in a region that\u2019s home to coral habitats \u2014 you should consider using a reef-safe sunscreen. By skipping ingredients known to be harmful to reefs in large quantities, this sunscreen will lessen your environmental impact.\nWe like Thrive Bodyshield SPF 50. The main active ingredient is non-nano zinc oxide (23.5%), the most coral-friendly option available in the US. Zinc oxide sunscreen might conjure images of lifeguards with white noses, but of those we tested, this one was the most clear and rubbed in with minimal effort. Once on skin, Thrive\u2019s Bodyshield SPF 50 feels less greasy than many other sunscreens. (You can read more about our research on what \u201creef-safe\u201d means, and find a few more good options, in our full guide to reef-safe sunscreens.)\nI\u2019ve used Raw Elements Face + Body Cream SPF 30 almost exclusively while living in Hawaii, where reef-safe sunscreen is required by law. Similar to our reef-safe top pick, Raw Elements sunscreen uses non-nano zinc as its active ingredient (23%) and a variety of tea leaf extracts and seed butter as binders. However, it is rated to only 30 SPF.\nI\u2019ve been impressed that it stays on my skin even during long surfing sessions \u2014 especially in high summer, when the water around Honolulu feels like a plate glass mirror reflecting the sun onto my skin. If you\u2019re concerned about wasteful packaging, most Raw Elements products come in aluminum containers, bio-resin tubes, or compostable sticks.\nBeach games and toys\nLightweight beach bocce\nFlungle: ridiculous name, fun game. To play the Waboba Flungle Ball Toss Game, you throw the target ball with the tail, which gives you a little extra leverage for the toss. There are six color-matched balls that you toss towards the target; you use the tail of the target ball to measure the distance to those balls and calculate your points. The set weighs under 2 pounds, is easy to pack, and comes with a travel bag that\u2019s about 8 inches tall (easy to stow inside a beach bag). It\u2019s exactly what you want at the beach: simple and fun.\nFlying disc\nAerobie Pro Ring famously set the Guinness World Record in 2003 for the world\u2019s longest throw: 1,333 feet. Chances are you don\u2019t need it to fly that far. But the same attributes that make it such an effective flyer make it a great beach toy for kids. It\u2019s lightweight, and the ring shape is both pliable and soft enough that small hands (or a whole arm, if you\u2019re nimble) can catch the disc out of the air.\nSandcastle toys\nWe looked for an alternative to the multitude of cheap plastic toys that fill up beaches in the summer. The Green Toys Sand Play Set is made of recycled plastic and feels more durable than your typical dollar-store sets. We also looked at biodegradable sets, which we\u2019d love to recommend but are often out of stock. But if you can find either the Rogue Wave Compostable Beach Toy Set or the Lovelotte Eco Beach Toy Set, they\u2019re good sets as well.\nAs another alternative, the Pottery Barn Kids Beach Sand Mold Toys are made from recycled silicone. Some people prefer using silicone items to plastic, and the material tends to last longer without degrading, but it\u2019s not something you want to discard on the beach all the same. The flexible mold of this set was something of an asset for building castle walls: It helped release the shape more easily than traditional, stiff plastic molds.\nSand sifter\nWe like the Sand Dipper Treasure Digger Sifter. It\u2019s an excellent toy for sifting through shore break and looking for shells. But it really shines at the end of the day for digging and sifting through the kids\u2019 area, looking for lost Matchbox cars and other little toys that so often disappear in the sand.\nPaddleball set\nIf you\u2019ve been to the beach in the last four decades, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve seen the Pro Kadima Paddle Set in action. There\u2019s not much to explain: It\u2019s a well-made paddle set with a nice ball for whacking. Draw out a court in the sand, if you like, or simply volley away through the afternoon. The choice is yours. We did compare the Pro Kadima set with the more expensive Frescobol Paddle Set, but the handle of the latter started coming apart right out of the box.\nSpikeball set\nSpikeball is an odd little game. It\u2019s so simple and yet compulsive. Bounce a ball against a stretched nylon net on a frame and pass that ball to the next person who bounces it. We tested a competitor against the The Original Spikeball Kit, and its nylon lacked the right kind of stretch to create a satisfying bounce pass.\nWater-friendly football\nI was never a football player. I was never really a sports fan, either. But few pleasures are as good and as instinctive as diving for a football into a body of water. The HydroSport Water Football won over our testers for its grip and heft without feeling too firm. We dismissed the classic Nerf Pool Beach Water Football for exactly those reasons: It was too firm and not grippy enough, especially when wet.\nKite\nPrism\u2019s history with kite design started over 30 years ago. The company builds kites of all types and designs, including some powerful kites and foil kites. We picked two hobby kites that manage to distill all that design knowledge into little packages. The Prism Pocket Flyer Kite is a miniature foil kite that fits in your pocket, while the Prism Vertex is more of a classic kite design and only takes a few seconds to set up. We took the kites out on a beautiful day at the beach, and to be honest, we\u2019d forgotten how much fun a kite can be.\nBeach accessories\nThe OM System Tough TG-7 captured the best-looking images of the cameras we tested, and its 4x zoom lens provides a wide view but zooms in far enough for portraits or architectural details. (OM System is the new name of the camera brand formerly known as Olympus.) The lens also has a wide-enough aperture to capture portraits that make your subject stand out from the background.\nAs for its tough-cam bona fides: It works underwater as deep as 50 feet below the surface, it can tolerate falls as far as 7 feet, and it can withstand cold down to 14 degrees Fahrenheit. For additional options, take a look at our full guide to underwater cameras.\nSurf shirts, board shorts, and other surf clothing\nTops\nSport fabrics have come a long way in the past decade. To shelter your skin from the sun, you no longer need to squeeze into a thin, skin-tight rash guard. We\u2019ve tested shirts from five companies over seven years, and nothing comes close to the quality, construction, or material design offered by Bluesmiths. The hydrophobic material repels water, so the shirts dry incredibly quickly, even when you\u2019re sitting on a surfboard or stand-up paddle board. The drier you are, the more comfortable you\u2019ll be in the elements.\nUnlike most surf shirts, the Bluesmiths Kanaha Hydrophobic Shirts (women\u2019s and men\u2019s) are fitted with a pocket, key leash, and front loop for lacing through your board shorts (it keeps everything in place, even if you take a tumble). The shirts offer a UPF protection of 35 (wet or dry). They are also available in a short-sleeve design. In our testing, the Kanaha shirts have been far more durable and less prone to stretching out than other shirts, which were made from looser polyester and elastane blends.\nIf you want a shirt that provides optimal sun protection, with silky-smooth, quick-drying fabric and an extra back pocket, consider the Patagonia R\u00f8 Surf Hoody (currently available only in men\u2019s sizes). If you expect to surf in scorching heat, you might want to get a lighter color. Like our other picks, this shirt provides 50+ UPF under intense sun. Patagonia\u2019s R\u00f8 series is lightweight, feels virtually seamless, and offers surfers the most upper-body sun protection without compromising mobility (or vision).\nThe hood has a stiff built-in visor (which provides enough shade to give your eyes an appreciable break from the sun\u2019s glare), and it holds steady during duck dives (when you\u2019re diving underneath a breaking wave with your surfboard). It stays out of your way, even when you have it pushed back around your neck (at which point it offers excellent sun protection for your neck). The back has a zippered pouch, which is big enough to store wax, sunscreen, reef booties, or even a small hydration pack (perfect for surf spots that require long paddles). Even with all of these bells and whistles, the R\u00f8 Surf Hoody is skintight, with a connector that loops into the tie string on your board shorts and thumb loops to keep your shirttail and sleeves from riding up. It\u2019s these little touches that set this shirt apart from O\u2019Neill\u2019s similar model (although we do very much like the waist-level drawstring on the O\u2019Neill model).\nShorts\nThere are few things worse when you\u2019re surfing than trying to move or pop up on your board and having your legs restricted by your shorts, either as they catch on your leg or somehow refuse to move with you. The O\u2019Neill Hyperfreak Boardshorts bypass that issue. They\u2019re pliable in every direction, incredibly comfortable, and long-lasting. I\u2019ve worn several pairs for over two years of very regular surfing \u2014 at least a couple of sessions a week \u2014 and only recently had to retire a pair when the side pocket zipper broke. The Hyperfreak shorts are held in place with a sturdy drawstring that passes through four gusseted holes, and they stay on securely as long as they\u2019re tied tightly.\nA surfer\u2019s guide to bikini shopping\nAnyone who\u2019s searched for a bikini knows there are innumerable swimwear brands in the world, all focused on various activities and styles and body shapes. It\u2019s difficult to recommend a specific bikini shape or cut for most people, since the variety of choices and styles and fits are too individual for any single pick to be useful. That said, after years of trying out some 14 swimwear brands while surfing and swimming \u2014 and looking for bikini sets that will withstand the ravages of the sun and stay in place comfortably \u2014 my wife (the primary tester of these suits) keeps the following companies at the top of her list.\nFor a balance of high activity and style: Dos Gardenias\nDos Gardenias uses \u201c100% regenerated nylon fiber made from pre- and postconsumer waste, like fishing nets, industrial plastic waste, and fabric scraps.\u201d The look is defined by simple yet fashionable cuts and sturdy materials. Although its offerings are not specifically designed around sport, we\u2019ve found the shapes and materials to be remarkably secure while surfing, swimming, and diving.\nFor more-casual days at the beach: Maaji and OneOne Swimwear\nMaaji offers many more cuts and patterns than Dos Gardenias. Though not all of Maaji\u2019s cuts are suited for strenuous activity, they\u2019re made to similarly high standards and will last over time without stretching out in the sun. Maaji is also a registered B Corp.\nOneOne Swimwear is a Colombian company, and its style leans toward offering a bit less coverage, which may or may not be to everyone\u2019s taste. A couple of things stand out: One is this company\u2019s choice of materials, the sturdiest of all the materials from brands we\u2019ve tested. Also, OneOne suits feature deep hem cuts \u2014 most of the tops, for instance, have inch-wide straps and banding, so they feel secure without biting. My wife reaches for OneOne suits the most, and they still hold up after almost daily use. OneOne isn\u2019t as sustainably focused as the other companies we\u2019ve mentioned, but it makes all its suits on demand, which reduces waste, and it reports that 50% of the bikinis are made from recycled material.\nSurfboards\nAmong the thousands of boards, models, and brands to choose from, we recommend two somewhat universal soft-top models for families and casual beachgoers: the Wavestorm and the Lost RNF from Catch Surf. These are legitimate boards that are used everywhere from 1-inch-high whitewater to well above Jaws in Maui. Yet both boards are still, at their core, family-friendly beach toys \u2014 best for throwing in the car with everything else and not having to worry too much about them.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an inexpensive surfboard, there\u2019s one obvious and incredibly popular choice: the Wavestorm. To determine how tough the Wavestorm is, we\u2019ve spent years riding it in all kinds of conditions, including a perfect overhead day at South Carolina\u2019s Folly Beach (courtesy of Tropical Storm Colin) and several winters on the North Shore of Hawaii. The boards flex considerably more than fiberglass, and their soft fins slide out in steep surf, which translates to less speed and maneuverability. But that\u2019s noticeable only if you\u2019ve been surfing for a while.\nA foam board is a sure bet for kids and adults who want to play in the water. \u201cThe bottom line is you want to make sure that a beginner can get up on their feet during their first time surfing, and the Wavestorm will do that,\u201d said Jenny Brown, owner of Charleston\u2019s Shaka Surf School. \u201cIt\u2019s safe, cheap, and effective.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re just starting to learn to surf as an adult, the Lost RNF from Catch Surf isn\u2019t the right board, unless you\u2019re committed to a long, albeit potentially rewarding, struggle. However, this soft-top version of the legendary RNF (Round Nose Fish) is great for younger children to learn on (since they don\u2019t need as much volume in a board) or for those who want to challenge themselves as they move toward smaller boards.\nThe soft-top RNF is looser and plenty of fun in the water, if you know a bit about what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s also smaller than the 8-foot Wavestorm. You can pick from three sizes \u2014 5 feet 5 inches, 5 feet 11 inches, and 6 feet 5 inches \u2014 though we recommend the 5-foot-11-inch model for most adults. Incidentally, if you live near high-traffic beaches or beaches that are frequently blackballed, taking the fins out of the RNF or bringing Catch Surf\u2019s Beater would allow you to get out in the water on a board without running afoul of the rules.\nSurf accessories\nIf you\u2019re a beginner surfer, here\u2019s a basic truth: Wax is wax. So buy what you can get your hands on and apply it correctly, using a wax comb as needed (here\u2019s a good video primer). And match it to the temperature of the water you\u2019ll be surfing in, base coat first (this part is crucial because waxes designed for colder water will melt off in hot water, and hot-water waxes can get too hard and slippery in cold water). The local surf report \u2014 or even a local \u2014 can tell you what the water temperature is, so you\u2019ll know which wax to buy. As your surfing progresses, you may find that you prefer one brand over another, but that\u2019s entirely subjective and respective to your style of surfing.\nWe\u2019ve spent years trying most brands, and Sticky Bumps remains our go-to bar of wax for any board. It\u2019s reliable and comes in a variety of temperature grades, and the block shape is easy to split in half and applies evenly. Though perhaps not as iconic as Sex Wax and not as sticky as the chest-hair-pulling, aerial-enabling Fu Wax, Sticky Bumps remains the most reliable and well-balanced paraffin wax available for any surfer, no matter their ability.\nBut if you want an alternative wax that\u2019s not made with petroleum-based paraffin, try Matunas Organic Surf Wax. It\u2019s among the cheapest and most environmentally friendly waxes available in the US \u2014 made from jasmine and leftover plant-based material from the company\u2019s farm in Santa Cruz, California. A handful of Wirecutter testers tried it while surfing juicy waves in Hawaii and at Folly Beach in South Carolina. We all agree it applies just as evenly and solidly as artificial waxes we\u2019ve used in the past, and it smells nice.\nThis article was edited by Ria Misra and Christine Ryan.\nMentioned above\n- After years of researching bed sheets\u2014from cotton to flannel and everywhere in between\u2014we\u2019ve found the best sheet sets no matter what your preference.The Best Sheets\n- After testing beach towels all over the country, we have four great options\u2014plus a towel alternative that\u2019s ideal for families with babies.The Best Beach Towel\n- A sunshade can give you a lot more shade than an umbrella, with a lot less drama.

      "text": "What Does \u2018Buying American\u2019 Even Mean?\nLast year, I decided to treat myself to a set of really good wrenches. After a lot of research, I narrowed my list to three manufacturers that, while not widely known, got rave reviews on obscure forums where professional mechanics gather. Then I noticed that one, Wright Tool of Ohio, makes all of its tools in the US, using only American steel. Motivated not by patriotism but more by plain hometown spirit, I made my choice: Of course I would \u201cbuy American.\u201d\nIt felt good to do that. And I\u2019m hardly alone in that feeling. Americans like to support American industry. Polls indicate that about two-thirds of Americans would pay more for US-made products over imports. Why? Largely because American shoppers have long believed in the superiority of American quality, in supporting American industry, and in the idea that \u201cbuying American\u201d promotes American jobs.\nThis \u201cBuy American\u201d bias has long driven American policy. The country\u2019s first president deliberately chose \u201chomespun\u201d fabric made in America, not imported from England, to wear at his inauguration in 1789. Nearly 228 years later, America\u2019s 45th president promised at his inaugural address in January 2017 to \u201cfollow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has followed through on that vow, issuing a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order and imposing tariffs on imports with the explicit goal of promoting US manufacturing and jobs.\nWhether the tariffs will achieve their goal is unclear. Tariffs that make imports more expensive also make domestic goods (and American exports) more expensive. Policies that protect jobs in one domestic industry hurt workers in others. Even the seemingly airtight \u201cMade in the USA\u201d label leaks around its edges: Fakes abound, cheaters go unpunished, goods assembled elsewhere of US-made parts get treated, arguably unfairly, as imports.\nAs globalization leads the economies of individual nations to become ever more inextricably intertwined, it\u2019s particularly hard for shoppers to clearly and decisively support a single country with their purchases.\nGiven that, the seemingly simple decision to \u201cbuy American\u201d becomes complicated.\nTrump\u2019s trade policy (as reported in The New York Times, Wirecutter\u2019s parent company) is intended to encourage domestic industry by making imports more expensive through tariffs. But the line between \u201cimported\u201d and \u201cAmerican-made\u201d has slowly disappeared to the point of near-invisibility in the past half-century. Thanks to free trade, \u201cproducts are no longer made in one country and sold in another, but are rather made in the world,\u201d said Robert Z. Lawrence, professor of international trade and investment at Harvard Kennedy School.\nHe pointed to cars as an example. \u201cWhat happens is, components are made in a variety of countries and then assembled in other places,\u201d Lawrence explained. \u201cAmerican\u201d automobile parts are made all over the world (including in the US) and compiled into sub-assemblies, like transmissions, elsewhere (often in Mexico). Finally, these sub-assemblies are often, but not always, gathered in the US or Canada for final assembly into vehicles. The American Automobile Labeling Act requires all automakers that sell in the US to list their vehicles\u2019 percentage of US/Canada- and foreign-produced parts. It\u2019s fascinating to read the complete AALA report (PDF). Ford\u2019s most-American-made vehicle, the F-150, to pick an iconic \u201cdomestic\u201d model, is just 56 percent US/Canadian. The Honda Accord, to pick an iconic \u201cimport,\u201d is 65 percent US/Canadian.\nThe same process cuts the other way, and across industries. Bryan Riley, director of the conservative National Taxpayers Union Free Trade Initiative, gave the example of smartphones. \u201cPeople see \u2018Made in China\u2019 and think we don\u2019t make anything anymore, even though most of that iPhone isn\u2019t made in China. They do the final assembly, but the know-how and most of the parts come from other countries, including the United States\u2026. It\u2019s no longer 1950, where you can look at something and it\u2019s made in the US, or it\u2019s made in Germany, or it\u2019s made in Japan.\u201d\nSpeaking of \u201cmade in\u201d: \u201cMade in the USA\u201d labels are a guideline, not a guarantee. The Federal Trade Commission has extremely detailed rules for what qualifies as an American-made product\u2014one that can legally bear the \u201cMade in the USA\u201d label (or language or imagery that suggests it). Qualification boils down to this: The product has to be \u201call or virtually all\u201d made in the USA, with foreign-made components comprising a \u201cnegligible\u201d proportion of the total. This distinguishes \u201cMade in the USA\u201d from another common designation, \u201cAssembled in the USA,\u201d which usually indicates that the components are substantially made abroad and put together in the US.\nBut the label does not guarantee that a product is, in fact, made in the USA. The FTC does not approve its use; that decision remains with the manufacturers. Unscrupulous manufacturers can and do use the label falsely, betting that they\u2019ll get away with it. There\u2019s little risk in doing so: As The New York Times reported in March, even when cheaters are caught, the FTC often lets them off without so much as a fine. (Ironically, the strict rules also cause some manufacturers to err on the side of caution and not use the label even though their products appear to meet the guidelines.)\nIn short, \u201cbuying American\u201d is not as simple as buying things with a \u201cMade in the USA\u201d tag.\nRather, much of \u201cbuying American\u201d comes down to trade policy, and as such is a political rather than an economic position. We talked about it with Dana Frank, professor emerita in history at the University of California Santa Cruz and the author of Buy American: The Untold Story of Economic Nationalism, originally published in 1999. The Trump administration\u2019s focus on protectionism brought the book new attention. When we spoke, she emphasized its main argument: That \u201cBuy American\u201d has always been a slogan of nativist movements. \u201cWhat \u2018Buy American\u2019 does is it sets up workers in other countries as our enemy,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen we should be thinking of them as our allies.\u201d\nFrank argues that there have been three waves of Buy American\u2013ism: First in the early 20th century, led by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, against the \u201cyellow peril\u201d of Japanese foreign labor; next in the 1970s and 1980s, against Japanese automakers; and today under the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist, pro-tariff policies targeting Chinese and other imports.\nEconomists are well aware of the politics of protectionism. \u201cThe sexy thing to do is to find someone to blame,\u201d said Lawrence. Clearly there\u2019s political appeal in these policies\u2014but how do the affected manufacturers feel about them?\nRecent evidence suggests many American manufacturers don't want \u201cBuy American\u201d protections. Protectionism is \u201cnot being driven by the industry,\u201d said Riley. \u201cIt\u2019s being driven by the administration.\u201d Lawrence was blunter: \u201cPlay in your mind what\u2019s going to happen if you start to screw around with the supply chain and you put a tariff on these intermediate inputs, some of which cross the border two or three times before the final good emerges. This is why the Trump trade policy is hugely disruptive.\u201d\nMany business leaders oppose tariffs for that reason. In June, the leaders of more than 300 US companies, including electronics retailers, fashion brands, and streaming media services, testified before Congress, arguing that additional tariffs on Chinese goods would undermine their businesses by increasing their costs. Those companies followed the semiconductor industry voicing its opposition in July 2018, US automakers and suppliers uniting against tariffs in March 2019, and the apparel and footwear industry announcing its opposition in May.\nThe most common argument for tariffs and other \u201cBuy American\u201d policies is that they\u2019ll help American workers. Within the industries protected by narrowly targeted tariffs, that may be true. For example, the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 tariffs on imported steel and aluminum led to an immediate addition of several hundred US jobs in each of those sectors, according to industry representatives. The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of American unions, supported the metals tariffs as \u201cgood for working people.\u201d The United Auto Workers gave tentative support. The Teamsters fully supported tariffs.\nHowever, these same tariffs may reduce employment in other industries. Some economists estimated that the tariffs would cost upwards of 100,000 jobs in downstream industries that relied on aluminum and steel, because the higher cost of the metals would reduce profits, limit job growth, and potentially necessitate layoffs. From a purely economic perspective, the high cost of tariffs means they\u2019re inefficient as job-makers. In the worst-case scenario, as Eric Boehm of the libertarian Reason magazine calculates, the aluminum tariffs created just 300 jobs at a cost of $690 million, or $2.3 million per job.\nAnd the benefit of tariffs can be fleeting even in the industries they\u2019re designed to boost. US aluminum-production jobs are actually down over the past year. While I was writing this article, U.S. Steel announced that it would be idling two of its US blast furnaces, and another one in Europe, in response to an anticipated domestic and international glut of steel production.\nSeeing the mills shutting down calls to mind a popular but outdated vision of American manufacturing: that it means steel, coal, and cars, concentrated in Pittsburgh, Appalachia, and Detroit, respectively. It\u2019s true that these jobs were once a ticket to upward mobility and middle-class earnings. But automation has eaten away at those jobs (even as US manufacturing output has held steady as a fraction of GDP). Today, Americans who might once have worked in a factory are instead concentrated in service jobs such as retail, home health care, and construction. Instead of goods, American workers are \u201cmaking\u201d services\u2014because that\u2019s what Americans are buying. And they\u2019re working nationwide.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re building a house, you\u2019re building it in a place\u2014these jobs don\u2019t migrate,\u201d said Ileen DeVault, professor of labor history at Cornell University. \u201cHome-care workers, again, it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t ship overseas\u2026. We\u2019re not going to send all of our elderly to India.\u201d\n\u201cYou see over time that as the United States has become wealthier, and as goods have become cheaper, our spending on goods has fallen,\u201d Lawrence said. That\u2019s unexpected: According to standard economic theory, cheaper goods should mean more goods being purchased. But instead, said Lawrence, \u201cIn 1970, Americans spent about half of all their consumption spending on goods. Today, it\u2019s under a third. Rich people, they want a psychiatrist, they want a tax consultant, they want a personal trainer. Those are services.\u201d\nSo how should Americans support growth and opportunity for the people working in those fields? Ultimately, investing in \u201cMade in the USA\u201d means investing in education.\nMany of the industries where the US remains strong are high-tech: aerospace, computer hardware, telecommunications, chemicals. Traditional blue-collar industries, such as auto making and mining, are also increasingly reliant on technology. \u201cIf we look at the mix of workers who are employed in manufacturing, we find increasingly it\u2019s college-educated workers who are being demanded,\u201d said Lawrence. In this view, trade policy is the wrong tool for rebuilding American manufacturing jobs. \u201cThe key is education. The skills being demanded are greater and greater. The long-run solution has to be heavy emphasis on skills acquisition\u2014to provide workers that actually can work in the jobs that are becoming available.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know whether buying my Wright Tool wrenches improved any other American\u2019s life meaningfully. I don\u2019t really even know if those wrenches are much better than the alternatives. I do know that they have proven as good as the reviews said they were, that they\u2019ve improved my life in a small but meaningful way, and that it still feels good to have bought American."

      "text": "The Best Gear for Your Road Trips\nA road trip is an adventure. It doesn\u2019t matter how far you go. But all adventures require a little planning (and one or two backup plans, in case things go sideways).\nOur original trip, in 2016, included 60 hours of researching and testing gear to take on the open road. We packed all of our top contenders into a Honda Fit EX and headed out on a four-day jaunt to determine what\u2019s nice to have, what\u2019s great, and what\u2019s absolutely essential for your next road trip.\nIn 2020 we added a few items to help you adhere to safe-travel guidelines, and as those things will always come in handy during flu and cold season, we\u2019re keeping them in the guide. We\u2019ve also added several selections to take on challenging winter car trips.\nAfter traveling for 1,500 miles, through four states and six national parks, we think we have a good grasp on what makes an excellent road trip. In addition to performing our own research and testing, we consulted with half a dozen engineers, mechanics, and other experts to bring you these picks. Our hope is that the recommendations in this guide will help you see more and explore farther down the road than you thought possible.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find recommendations for cargo boxes, binoculars, coolers, emergency beacons, a first-aid kit, a folding blanket, an ice scraper, an instant camera, inverters for your electronics, a multi-tool, phone mounts, a portable jump starter, ratchets and tie-down straps, a road atlas, stain remover, a stowable daypack, sun shades, sunglasses, a tire-pressure gauge, a toolkit for cars, a travel game, a travel pillow, water jugs, windshield water repellent, wipes, and so much more. These items will help you have a successful road trip, regardless of region or weather.\nHowever, even if you have the best gear in the world, it\u2019s always best to address small problems before they become emergencies. That\u2019s why we asked Christopher Smith, a veteran automotive journalist with a penchant for restoring fixer-uppers, to help us put together some advice on how to prepare your car for a trip. We cover everything from checking your tires and dipsticks to knowing what you should do if your car starts smelling like rotten eggs for seemingly no reason.\nThis guide isn\u2019t specifically geared toward families, though most of the picks would be useful to a family traveling by car. We do have guides to infant car seats, travel car seats, booster car seats, and water bottles for kids\u2014all things that are of particular interest to families on the road.\nStowing your gear\nBeing able to find what you need when you need it\u2014whether it\u2019s water, emergency lights, a change of clothes, or a granola bar\u2014can make the difference between a short, easy stop that rejuvenates and a long, frustrating one that makes you question why you left home in the first place.\nIt all starts with packing. Don\u2019t overthink it. We like to keep items grouped: emergency gear in the back right of the trunk, water in the back left, spare batteries in the glove compartment along with the power inverter, and so on. After a few days, double-checking that everything is where it should be before heading off becomes a comforting ritual, and it helps mitigate the worry that you left \u2026 something \u2026 in the motel last night.\nAnd don\u2019t overpack. As with a bag, a well-packed car is one that has less than you think you want to bring but everything that you truly need. You don\u2019t have to bring everything\u2014just the things that are essential. Remember, you want to enjoy the drive. Not having to worry about countless items that someone might lose or misplace is a big step toward that enjoyment.\nCargo boxes\nA cargo box effectively allows you to double your trunk space by moving bulky items from your car\u2019s interior or trunk to its roof. After gathering up as much intel as we could about rooftop cargo boxes from experts, retailers, manufacturers, customers, and outdoor-gear reviewers, we\u2019ve concluded that of the 21 boxes we surveyed, the Yakima SkyBox NX XL offers the best combination of features, build quality, and value pricing for most road trips.\nThe NX line replaces the Carbonite line of Yakima boxes, which included our previous cargo box pick, the SkyBox 16 Carbonite.\nThe cargo box\u2019s low-drag aerodynamic design minimizes wind noise and reduces the impact on fuel economy. Its 18 cubic feet of space allows it to hold skis, duffle bags, backpacks, sleeping bags and other camping gear, or any random (though fairly lightweight) stuff, and it does so securely\u2014both in solidly mounting to your roof rack and in resisting theft. If you don\u2019t have a rack already, this REI car rack buying guide is a good place to start, but be sure to consult your car\u2019s owner manual to see how much weight its roof can bear.\nThe SkyBox NX XL is easy to use. Like most cargo boxes these days, it uses sliding brackets, rather than one or two fixed spots, for attachment to the crossbars, making perfect positioning a snap. To secure the brackets to the crossbars, you use a simple torque wrench (included) that will announce with an audible click\u2014like a gas-tank cap\u2014when you\u2019ve tightened the four installation bolts down securely. The tool lives inside the cargo box, though out of the way of your gear, for safekeeping.\nOnce installed, the SkyBox NX XL allows easy access from either side of the car, and its newly redesigned dimensions (a change from the previous model) make it less likely to interfere with a liftgate if you put it on a hatchback or station wagon.\nRoof straps\nI spent many years working in rigging and rope access on offshore oil platforms, where I played with loads, angles, line pulls, and sheave-block friction percentages\u2014in other words, I know a thing or two about strapping things down. You can find two common types of roof straps: ratchet straps, which have a mechanical lever and gear, and cam straps (sometimes called \u201clashing\u201d or \u201cloop\u201d straps), which connect to themselves through a cam buckle. If I could choose only one type, I\u2019d get ratchet straps because they\u2019re easier to secure. More specifically, I\u2019d get the Keeper Endless Loop Ratchet Tie-Down.\nWe spent several hours examining 22 strap options before landing on the Keeper version. Keeper is a reliable brand, and the ratchets are easy to tighten and loosen, thanks to their all-metal construction. (Cheaper ratchets are hard to release and prone to sticking or breaking due to their reliance on plastic parts.) At 13 feet long, these 1-inch straps are long enough for all but the most strenuous loads on the largest of vehicles, and their nylon webbing\u2019s 400-pound working load limit and 1,200-pound break strength put them right in line with similarly priced straps. You could get something that\u2019s heavier-duty or longer, but you\u2019d be paying more for strength or length you don\u2019t need.\nOn our trip, driving in a car without a roof rack, we used the Keeper straps to great success. The straps held a full water jug to the roof of our Honda for a few dozen miles through the backroads of Arizona with no issues. Other Wirecutter staffers have owned Keeper straps for years and vouch for their overall strength and durability.\nIf you prefer the simplicity of a cam strap or don\u2019t need the extra force that a ratchet strap provides, we like the NRS 1\u2033 HD Tie-Down Straps, which come in a variety of lengths. They\u2019re pricier than more popular options, but their webbing is rated to a 1,500-pound breaking strength (the cam itself has a 2,000-pound breaking strength) and a 500-pound working load, in contrast with the 600-pound breaking strength and 200-pound working load of this best-selling Keeper set. Equipment of this grade may seem like overkill, but Wirecutter\u2019s Mark Smirniotis had several weaker cams fail on him when he was strapping loads to his Jeep. He noted in 2016 that of all the straps on Amazon with more than 25 customer reviews, the NRS straps were the only ones that had no reviews complaining of failed cams. NRS is primarily known as the premier kayaking- and rafting-accessory company, so the folks there probably know something about strapping awkwardly large loads onto cars.\nFor owners of compact cars who want to move long or oversize loads, such as a kayak, we also like the Thule Quick Loop Strap. You secure these straps under the hood of your car (or the trunk, if you don\u2019t have a hatchback) to create a set of forward anchor points to help stabilize the forward section of whatever it is you\u2019re carrying. Judging from our testing, these straps are very quick to set up, and they can add a welcome level of versatility to tough packing situations.\nTips:\n- Always check the maximum load of your car\u2019s anchor points, such as the roof rack. Ratchet straps can apply a lot of force beyond just the weight of your belongings, so knowing your maximum load will help you avoid over-tensioning the straps.\n- If the straps vibrate against the roof while you drive, adding a few twists in them can sometimes stop them from slicing the air.\n- Don\u2019t put knots in your straps, especially if you\u2019re applying tension. Knots can cut through nylon with surprisingly little force. A knot also significantly reduces the overall load that the strap can handle.\n- Never use bungee cords to hold anything down. They\u2019re fine for stabilizing items but not for securing heavy loads.\nIn the driver\u2019s seat\nDriving can be fun, meditative, exhausting, and torturous. After five hours of driving through the desert, it can sometimes be all of those things at the same time.\nA thousand little gadgets promise to make a long drive somehow easier. Most of them are useless and seemingly designed to distract you more than anything else. Try to avoid these items. The best gear is durable, unobtrusive, and easy to use\u2014so you can keep your eyes (and your thoughts) on the road.\nYou will get bored\u2014500 miles on cruise control with an automatic transmission can be a pretty dull time. Not always, of course, but sometimes it will be boring, and maybe that\u2019s the point. In this frenetic age, that feeling is practically a luxury, and it\u2019s essential to the trip. Revel in it.\nSunglasses\nIt would be impossible for us to pick the best overall sunglasses, since your choice ultimately depends on your personal style. We have picks for cheap sunglasses in a separate guide. But driving sunglasses are different because they\u2019re designed to help you perform a specific task: driving safely. In that regard, Maui Jim makes the best sunglasses around, though they are something of an investment.\nWe compared a Maui Jim pair with more than 20 types of sunglasses, driving or otherwise, and found this pair to be the best of the bunch. The Maui Jim sunglasses had the clearest lenses, with no perceptible distortion, on the lightest frames we tested (0.6 ounce, or about half the weight of a wooden pencil). I\u2019ve never encountered sunglasses that I can wear for hours on end without somehow hurting my nose, ears, or both. But during my trip there were a few afternoons when I had completely forgotten I was even wearing the Maui Jim sunglasses\u2014despite five-plus hours of driving with them on.\nThe clarity of the lenses was another surprise. The Maui Jim lenses are so clear that it\u2019s borderline unsettling the first time you try on these sunglasses. Thanks to the lenses\u2019 exceptional clarity and polarization, everything\u2014including the scenery around you and the road ahead\u2014looks sharper through them.\nAs far as specific model recommendations go, I suggest scanning the offerings on the Maui Jim website and reading the fit descriptions to find something that matches your aesthetic sensibilities. Unlike companies that go by lens size only, Maui Jim lists face shape as part of its fit guidelines. That means you\u2019re more likely to find what\u2019s most comfortable for you on your first try. Just keep in mind that bigger lenses tend to be better because they offer more coverage.\nMaui Jim glasses come with a two-year warranty. After checking with the company, we confirmed that it fulfills warranties on its sunglasses no matter where you buy them. However, Maui Jim services only authentic lenses and frames that haven\u2019t been modified in any way. You can tell whether the pair you have is genuine (and not a knockoff) by confirming that the Maui Jim logo is etched, not just painted onto the lens.\nSmartphone mount\nIn an ideal world, people wouldn\u2019t use a phone at all while driving, and if you have a copilot, you shouldn\u2019t have to\u2014you can delegate the phone-related tasks to them. But in reality, for many drivers, a phone is the source for navigation, information, messages, music, and (of course) phone calls. However, if you hold the phone in your hand as you drive\u2014or look down at it in a cup holder or center-console bin\u2014it can be a major distraction and safety risk. That\u2019s why we recommend using a smartphone mount.\nI enjoy the simplicity of my phone with no accessories, so I like that the iOttie iTap Magnetic mounts offer an attractively easy way to mount and unmount my phone with one hand. In our tests, the magnets in all three versions\u2014dash/windshield, vent, and CD slot\u2014were strong, supporting most of our phones vertically and horizontally over even the roughest terrain. The mounts feature a strong magnetic plate and a ball-head joint for flexible positioning\u2014all while maintaining a small footprint and keeping your phone firmly in place.\nIf you want to charge your phone wirelessly while using it, we have suggestions from our guide to wireless charging phone mounts:\nThe iOttie Easy One Touch Wireless 2\u2014available as a dash and windshield mount or a vent and CD player mount\u2014offers a convenient way to charge your phone in the car while also giving you easy access to audio controls, directions, messages, and more. In our tests, both models ranked among the quickest at charging our phones. Their spring-loaded tension arms made attaching or removing a phone of any size simple, and they held the phone steady while we drove. Both models offer a wide range of adjustability for positioning your phone where you can readily see it, regardless of the vehicle. For less common configurations, we have more phone mounts worth considering in our guide.\nRain-repellent coatings\nRain and snow add stress to a road trip, and they decrease your visibility and your reaction time in an emergency. Along with wipers, rain-repellent windshield coatings can help keep your windshield clear. If you want the most effective rain repellent, pick up the classic Rain-X spray bottle and commit to applying it once a month. If you simply want to give your windshield a boost, Aquapel is almost as effective and can last six times longer between applications\u2014but it is very expensive.\nMost auto-supply shops offer a huge variety of Rain-X products, including wiper blades, gels, and washer-fluid additives, but you should stick to the original Rain-X formula in the 16-ounce spray bottle because it has the most reliably positive reviews from buyers. Once applied, Rain-X forms a hydrophobic coating, which causes water to bead up and quickly slide off your windshield. Most people who have used Rain-X agree that maintaining its effectiveness requires reapplication about once a month. If your wiper blades start \u201cchattering,\u201d that probably means the coating is beginning to wear unevenly, and it\u2019s time to reapply.\nIf you can\u2019t commit to applying Rain-X once a month, consider Aquapel. Instead of coating your windshield, it bonds to the glass chemically, and it should last for three to six months before you need to pull out another one-time-use sponge and reapply. YouTube user jwardell posted a 30-day comparison video that shows how Rain-X is more effective initially, but after a month Aquapel still works even after the Rain-X has all but worn off.\nFor either repellent, proper application is the key to getting the maximum benefit. You need to start with an extremely clean windshield. Then clean it again just to be sure. Both of these repellents dry best in warm weather, out of direct sun. Even when perfectly applied, however, these substances have potential drawbacks. Some people who have used them complain that the repellents cause noticeable haziness at night. Others report that they had trouble getting windshield chips professionally filled after learning that the chemicals interfered with repair methods\u2014though Aquapel\u2019s site disputes such claims. Still, if you\u2019re stuck in inclement weather on a road trip or a commute, either the original Rain-X spray or Aquapel can help increase visibility and decrease your stress levels.\nIce scraper and snow brush\nThe Hopkins SubZero 80037 tool combines a scraping blade and ice-crushing teeth to make quick work of thick or thin ice, and its plow-like bristle broom is the best we\u2019ve tested\u2014equally adept at shoveling snow off body panels and brushing it out from tight spots around mirrors and wipers. The Hopkins SubZero has a self-locking extension that\u2019s easy to use when you want to fold the scraper away to make room in the trunk of your car. It\u2019s of average size\u201439 inches folded up and 60 inches fully extended. But no other contender offers such a complete scraping-and-sweeping package with so few weaknesses.\nPaper road atlas\nWith the advent of GPS units and smartphone navigation apps (both of which we recommend over the onboard navigation systems that might come with a car), the age of the paper road atlas would seem to be over. But don\u2019t let anyone convince you of that. A road atlas is the heart of every road trip. It\u2019s the inspiration.\nPlanning a road trip starts with imagining the places you could be next weekend, if you threw a few granola bars and some clothes into the backseat and left everything else behind. Of course, you could bring up Google Maps, look up the top 10 travel destinations near you, plan your exact route, and save a PDF to your digital device so you\u2019d know exactly where to go and how to get there at each stage of your trip.\nOr you could pull out a physical map and highlight a route. You might not know exactly what to expect when you get there, but you\u2019ll definitely know that you can get there. And regardless of electronic-device failures, you will always have a map in hand.\nFor use in the car, we like the classic Rand McNally Road Atlas\u2014just make sure to get an updated edition. Its oversize shape makes it simple to read and easy to spread out on the hood or in your lap, and the user-friendly design can\u2019t be beat. This atlas\u2019s arrangement of state and keyhole maps is the best for navigation.\nAs a test, we used the Rand McNally atlas to complete the first leg of our trip, from Ventura to Joshua Tree, California, with no phones and no GPS, on roads we had never driven before. The Rand McNally atlas was simple, functional, and easy to follow. Most important, it was fun to use.\nWe did read one complaint from somebody who began using that year\u2019s map early: Some of the roads it listed as passable were still mid-construction at the time. If you\u2019re buying a map in the middle of the year or later, you could play it safe and stick with the current year\u2019s edition.\nGPS unit\nFor most shorter trips, a smartphone can provide all the navigation assistance you need. But should your journey take you off the beaten path (and out of your coverage area), we suggest the Garmin DriveSmart 55. Like the best GPS units, the DriveSmart 55 can also connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth, which lets you send destinations to the device, get incoming messages on screen, and receive extra trip and traffic info. The DriveSmart 55\u2019s extensive points-of-interest database helps guide you to an area\u2019s best sites and businesses through integrated Tripadvisor ratings, Foursquare listings, a database of sites from the History network, and US national park directories (something that other brands\u2019 models don\u2019t offer). Similar to a smartphone, the DriveSmart 55 allows multi-touch gestures, such as pinching or spreading for easier zooming on a map; this feature is a clear step up from the resistive displays of less-expensive units, which allow only single-finger gestures and require you to tap on the plus and minus buttons to zoom in or out.\nThe DriveSmart 55 also provides helpful traffic info in many metro areas. It responds to voice commands as effectively as the best GPS units, and like other top models it includes free lifetime map updates\u2014in contrast with the pricey updates you need to buy for many cars\u2019 built-in navigation systems.\nHealth and cleaning supplies\nBody wipes\nRoad-trip and backpacking veterans know just how much better a shower can make an adventure after three days and a lot of smelly clothes. When taking a shower is not an option, or even if you just want to tidy up a bit after a long drive, body wipes can provide some much-needed relief.\nWe considered 22 brands and tested nine different body wipes, including some that were popular on Amazon and others that were recommended on the blogs of seasoned outdoorspeople.\nCheap, portable, and durable, the Sea to Summit Wilderness Wipes were the clear winners.\nThe wipes come in a resealable package, which helps keep them fresher for longer. You can find them in two sizes, XL (8 by 12 inches, in a pack of eight) and Compact (6 by 8 inches, in a pack of 12). On our trip, we preferred the XL wipes for their extra coverage and longer cleaning power. The fully compostable Wilderness Wipes were among the most lightly scented ones we tested, and their lack of alcohol left our skin feeling clean and moist.\nSurface wipes\nMost disinfecting wipes are the same. Although we recommend Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, we advise getting any pack of wipes you can find that contains a disinfectant on the EPA\u2019s List N (most have a bleach or quaternary ammonium base). Clorox\u2019s bleach-free wipes are usually sold in single canisters or in four-packs at a range of retailers. These wipes can eliminate most pathogens on hard surfaces\u2014countertops, door handles, and bathroom fixtures\u2014in your home, vehicle, or motel room, but not on fabric or other soft materials.\nFace masks\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned in the past few years is that face masks can be useful whenever you\u2019re sick (with COVID-19, a cold, the flu, whatever) and don\u2019t want to share your misery with fellow passengers, people at rest stops, or anyone else. Fortunately, compared with the situation in early 2020, medical-style N95 and KN95 masks (which many experts recommend as the best protection) are widely available these days. They\u2019re easy to tuck into a bag, which we do now whenever we travel. You can find out where to buy these masks in our guide.\nStain remover\nIn our testing, we\u2019ve found that if you spend five hours a day in the car on a drive-through-fueled cannonball run, there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll get to your final destination without having some kind of condiments disaster. I met my own inevitable conclusion outside an In-N-Out Burger on the last leg of our trip.\nWhen the unavoidable happens, you\u2019ll need something more than a napkin and ice water to clean up the mess. We recommend Shout Wipe & Go Instant Stain Remover Wipes. We tested them against other instant spot removers and assorted DIY methods to see how they handled wine, coffee, lipstick, and mustard stains.\nIn our tests, the Shout wipes easily outperformed the popular Tide To Go pen, and the Shout option was the only stain remover that erased almost all traces of lipstick on the collar of a shirt. These wipes also did pretty well on the ketchup I spilled.\nThe single-use towelettes don\u2019t occupy much space; you can throw a dozen into your glove compartment and barely notice they\u2019re there. Plus, by using a single wipe per stain, you don\u2019t risk depositing an old stain on another piece of clothing, as you might with reusable stain-remover sticks.\nHand lotion\nYou might find yourself washing your hands a lot on the road, which can result in cracked and dry skin; also, the air in a car can be dehydrating. Native Moisturizing Lotion is affordable, widely available, and thin enough to spread quickly and smoothly onto your skin. (Testers with drier skin, however, found the lotion slightly too watery to last all day.) Unlike many of its competitors, this moisturizing lotion has a subtle scent rather than an overwhelming one. And it has a pump, which lets you dispense the lotion while preventing germs from getting into the container\u2014handy while you\u2019re on the road.\nStaying comfortable\nCan a long road trip be comfortable? I didn\u2019t think so: Long hours of sitting in one position, nights spent camping or sleeping in cheap motel beds, and breaks for indigestible fast food are a terrible combination. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\nWith a little planning and a few small luxuries, you can keep the enthusiasm of your trip alive. Skip the fast food and instead pack your own snacks and water. Keep off the main highways and pull over when the scenery strikes you (not when you\u2019ve gone a certain number of miles). And stop for as long as you need. The clich\u00e9 is unavoidable: It\u2019s the journey that\u2019s important, not the destination (though that should be good too!).\nFolding blanket\nThere\u2019s only so much time you can spend in a car without needing to pull over to pause, stretch your legs, and take in the scenery. We stopped dozens of times on our trip, and we were glad every time we were able to take a side road, pull out a blanket, and find a place to sit down and share some food.\nIn 2023, Nemo enlarged the Victory Blanket, which previously fit just two people, to fit four people. At roughly 95 by 95 inches, according to our measurements, the Nemo Victory Picnic Blanket (XL) is now bigger than most blankets we looked at; it\u2019s well suited for larger groups of people or for two people who want room for more board games and snacks. For those who need even more space, the Victory Blanket is also available in a truly mammoth extra-extra-large version (120 by 120 inches). Both sizes come with two adjustable, clasping straps that keep the blanket rolled up tight, and those clasps can perform double duty as bottle openers.\nTravel pillow\nA good travel pillow is hard to find. It shouldn\u2019t take up much space, and it should be able to expand when it needs to. And, ideally, it should allow you to shape it for use as a shoulder or neck pillow when necessary, such as when you\u2019re on a plane or in the passenger seat of a car.\nWe found that the foam-filled Therm-A-Rest Compressible Pillow Cinch fit all of those criteria exceedingly well. During the day, it can fold in on itself (a loop-and-toggle closure holds it tight), which makes it easy to stow in a backpack or to toss into the backseat. When it\u2019s in this tightly packed configuration, you can also use it as a shoulder and lumbar pillow. The Therm-A-Rest pillow is a bit larger than your typical travel pillow when it\u2019s packed down\u2014about the size of a tissue box\u2014but saving space is less of a priority when you\u2019re driving instead of flying.\nAt night, the pillow unrolls and expands into a decent bed pillow, though side-sleepers with larger frames may say it has too little padding. But this is a travel pillow, of course, so it will never feel like your home pillow, which is all part of the fun somehow. I sleep on my side and back, and I found it exceptionally comfortable compared with camping pillows I\u2019d used in the past, although I did have to supplement it with a flannel shirt when I wanted to sleep on my side. In spring 2022, Therm-A-Rest released a slightly redesigned version of the pillow. The \u201cregular\u201d version is roughly the same size and weight as the old \u201cmedium\u201d version, but the integrated pocket is now larger (9 inches deep instead of 6), which we found makes the pillow easier to roll up. The pillow also has a cord sewn in a loop into its back; you can tighten the cord and cinch it securely to make the pillow firmer. One other change: A thin layer of polyfill backs the brushed polyester fabric on its face and softens the lumpiness of the foam filling.\nThe Therm-A-Rest pillow is well reviewed on Amazon and on REI\u2019s site. It\u2019s available in a variety of colors and sizes, but we prefer the regular/medium for its mix of portability and support.\nSleep mask\nNot every bedroom on the road is as dark as some people would like. That\u2019s why we recommend the Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask. Its contoured eyecups rest over your eyes, giving them space to move, which makes this mask comfortable to sleep in\u2014even when you\u2019re sitting upright (as you might in the passenger side of a car). Although the mask is adjustable, with Velcro straps, restless sleepers may want to consider other options in our full guide to sleep masks. If the Nidra mask fits you well, its weightless feel can make you forget you\u2019re wearing a mask at all as you continue to sleep in bright cars or poorly shuttered hotel rooms.\nWe\u2019ve recommended Rumpl\u2019s Original Puffy Blanket for more than five years, due to its plush construction, warm fill, and strong materials. Solidly built and cozy, this blanket works great as an extra layer for sleeping. (A puffy blanket has also come in handy for us especially on winter road trips in an EV, when we don\u2019t have the heat of a combustion engine warming the interior of the vehicle.)\nAlthough not the most water-resistant of the blankets we tested, it does a good job shrugging off spills. It wipes down easily, dries quickly, repels dirt and is easy to throw in the wash. Its synthetic fill also stays warm even when it gets wet. It comes in a wide range of colors\u2014about 25 at the time of publication\u2014and two sizes.\nVan camping mattress\nAlthough the size of the Hest Sleep System limits its use to either vans or pickup trucks, we\u2019re including it on this list because of its impressive night-over-night comfort. If your road trips tend to include lots of outdoor activities such as biking, hiking, or climbing, a good night\u2019s sleep is fundamental to having the energy you need to enjoy your days.\nThe Hest mattress takes up about the space of a small cot mattress (78 by 25 inches). Half consists of a dense foam layer, and the other half is a high-pressure inflatable base that needs a pump system to inflate. The Hest mattress is not a small piece of kit when rolled up: It weighs 26 pounds and packs up into a 28-by-16-inch bedroll, including the air pump.\nIf two of you are camping, you can connect two Sleep Systems together, though Hest also makes the Dually two-person foam mattress, which we haven\u2019t had a chance to test yet.\nPee funnel\nIt\u2019s not always easy to find a secluded spot on the side of the road or a clean-enough public restroom. The Tinkle Belle funnel has a stable, rigid base and a flexible spout, so it won\u2019t collapse under you during use, as Wirecutter senior staff writer Nancy Redd learned while researching the topic. One of the longest and widest of all the single-piece reusable funnels Nancy tested, the Tinkle Belle funnel makes less mess and is easy to use, as the more coverage a funnel has, the lower the risk of leakage or spills. While you\u2019re on the road, a simple rinse works fine for cleaning the funnel. Although the Tinkle Belle funnel is larger than most, it folds up for more-compact storage. You can also buy it with a matching case.\nWindshield protector and sunshade\nIf you\u2019re traveling through a sunny area, a sunshade for your windshield is a worthwhile investment. We like the A1 210T Fabric Sunshade, which we found to offer the best combination of low cost, decent coverage, and ease of setup. Its pop-up design made it much simpler to install and stow than the accordion-style shades we tested.\nRecommending just one sunshade for all cars is difficult because vehicles vary so much in size. But A1 offers several sizing options ranging from 59 by 19 inches to 69 by 36 inches (when the shade is fully expanded). You can compress each of these size options down to fit into a circular carrying case, which you can easily store on the door or underneath the seat. When you take the A1 sunshade out of the case, the compressed plastic arcs inside the sunshade spring open to create a rectangular shape, which you can adjust to fit your car\u2019s windshield. Amazon reviewers mention that the build quality is solid and that the metallic finish does a good job against the sun, particularly in hot Southern states like Florida and Texas. Several reviewers also recommend, however, that you buy a size smaller than you think you need to avoid excessive overhang.\nAlthough we prefer the A1 shade\u2019s pop-up design, it\u2019s not completely foolproof. Even with the choice in sizes, you still might have difficulty arranging the two plastic circles (which provide rigidity) within the A1 shade into a shape that hugs both edges of the front window and balances off the rearview mirror. Gaps, loose corners, or overhangs are almost unavoidable. In the end, what you gain in compactness and decent price, you lose in rigidity and reflective power. If you\u2019re uncertain, measure before buying, or look into a custom shade like the WeatherTech shade described below, which is guaranteed to fit.\nIf maximum temperature reduction is your goal, invest in a custom-fitted WeatherTech SunShade. Thicker than the A1 shade, WeatherTech\u2019s shade completely blacks out the windshield when you install it. This shade is also notably bulky\u2014about the size of a yoga mat when rolled up\u2014and difficult to store discreetly. But if you frequent sunny climates, it\u2019s well worth the cost, which at this writing starts at $55.\nPassenger window UV protector and shade\nWe researched 14 shade models and tested two finalists before determining that the Britax EZ-Cling Window Sun Shade is the best around. Available in a pack of two, it\u2019s dead simple to install, and it\u2019s effective. The Mylar on the back provides some protection against UV rays, and it acts like a large sheet of cling film that seems drawn to your windows once you pull the shades out of the box; the black mesh on the inner surface blocks a good amount of sunlight while still allowing you to see through the shade. We like the EZ-Cling shade better than film-only shades because the EZ-Cling design has a support ring of firmer material around its perimeter that makes it easier to install without prompting wrinkles and bubbles. I have way more fun than I rightly should when I\u2019m putting these things onto car windows.\nUnlike similar models with suction cups, the EZ-Cling shade doesn\u2019t have any secondary or removable parts. Wirecutter\u2019s Dan Frakes tried four other shades of various types and was dissatisfied with all of them, so he brought two EZ-Cling pairs for testing on a four-day road trip with his family. \u201cThey clung to the windows well,\u201d Dan said. \u201cThey were a lot easier to install than both the suction-cup models and the flimsy film ones we\u2019ve tried. We also removed them and reapplied them many times as our position relative to the sun changed, and it was easy to do so. Our only real complaint is that they\u2019re small\u2014they don\u2019t cover an entire backseat window.\u201d That kind of half-coverage can\u2019t keep the sun off young children for too long, especially when the sun is low on the horizon.\nQuick tip: Be sure to wipe your EZ-Cling shades with water when you first get them. A thin film protects the Mylar sheets during production, and it can leave a waxy residue on your car\u2019s windows if you use the shades right out of the box without first wiping them down.\nPortable extending shade\nAlthough the MoonShade works best on SUVs and trucks, it\u2019s lightweight and adaptable enough to work with smaller vehicles. When deployed, the MoonShade covers 9 by 7 feet, and its height adjusts from 78 inches to 96 inches. The shade mounts in three ways: directly to a roof rack, with very strong magnets, or with surprisingly robust suction cups for composite materials. We found that all three methods are secure enough for most situations, though as you might imagine, the suction cups are somewhat less stable than a direct mount on a rack. The MoonShade weighs 8 pounds and stows away into a carrying case that measures 28 by 6 inches, which is small enough to fit in the trunk of most cars. The MoonShade is great if you like to pull over in the middle of the day and set up a lunch, or if you tend to do activities outdoors in predominantly shadeless areas, as in the Southwest.\nRefreshments\nYou could cross America with no plan at all and survive solely on fast food as your nourishment, without ever having to leave your car. But we don\u2019t recommend that. Packing your own snacks and bringing your own water is not only healthier but also safer\u2014you never know when you might be stranded somewhere along the way.\nWe got stranded on our second day of driving, somewhere east of Joshua Tree, California, when we pulled off the side of the road onto a soft, sandy shoulder (we were new in this part of the country). The car\u2019s dash thermometer read 105 degrees Fahrenheit. As we waited, I was thankful that we had full water bottles, more water in the trunk, and plenty of food.\nA highway patrol officer drove up, gave us a little lesson about sand, and pushed us out with no trouble. So things turned out fine. The beauty of a road trip is in the unexpected moments. You can be prepared for most of them by having a little food and water on hand.\nCoolers\nCapable of carrying everything from healthy snacks to emergency ice packs, a cooler is one of those items that can make long trips a lot more enjoyable. After several 500-mile days on the road, having a chilled container filled with cold drinks and body wipes is a gift. We recommend bringing along our favorite soft cooler, the RTIC Soft Pack Cooler 20 Can.\nThe lid of the RTIC cooler is capped by more than 2 inches of closed-cell insulation, and its walls are a touch thicker than those of the far more expensive Yeti Hopper Flip. When we tested them head-to-head, all that extra insulation seemed to give the RTIC cooler an insulating edge. The exterior of the RTIC cooler is made of a durable, thickly coated nylon\u2014waterproof and tough\u2014and the zippers are waterproof, as well. Still, don\u2019t leave the cooler out in the sun, as the light and heat can degrade the material and slowly wear it out.\nWhen the RTIC cooler is open, it stands erect like a grocery bag, providing easy access for loading and unloading.\nIf you need extra insulation for longer hauls and don\u2019t mind sacrificing a little extra space, we recommend the RTIC 52 QT Ultra-Light Cooler. Our testing shows that a hard cooler will almost always outperform a soft cooler in insulating ability (five-plus days, versus a soft cooler\u2019s two-day average) and durability. So the hard cooler is a great pick for RVs, trailers, or boats. But hard coolers are huge, so you might not have room for one if you\u2019re carrying a bunch of other equipment.\nWater bottles\nIf you want a bottle that\u2019s easy to open and simple to sip from, the 25-ounce Br\u00fcMate Rotera is a great choice. This stainless steel bottle\u2019s integrated straw is set inside a twisting plastic cap. The cap is designed so you don\u2019t need to touch the straw to pull it free; a simple twist on the side of the cap rotates the lid\u2019s straw up into place. Inside the bottle, the plastic drinking tip connects to a metal straw. Closed, the cap is completely leak-free, making this bottle an ideal driving companion\u2014it\u2019s easy to sip from while you\u2019re keeping your eyes on the road, and it fits in most cup holders.\nThe 30-ounce Owala FreeSip Sway, designed around simple, one-handed operation, is great for people who find themselves constantly multitasking. The FreeSip Sway improves in almost every way upon the original Owala FreeSip. Our biggest concern about the original design was its propensity to pop open in bags if the push button was accidentally exposed. No longer! The Sway locks with an effective physical lever that \u201cblocks\u201d the lid from opening. Also, the Sway bottle is tapered at the bottom, so it fits in car cup holders more naturally than the original. And lastly, the 30-ounce Sway is only a little larger than the original, 24-ounce FreeSip but has a larger handle. Basically, with the FreeSip Sway, you can carry more water in a lockable bottle that is almost the same size as the original FreeSip and easier to carry.\nThe 16-ounce Contigo West Loop 3.0 is wider and fits better in most car cup holders than the Zojirushi mug, the top pick in our guide to travel mugs. The lid has an auto-sealing button that prevents spills. It also won\u2019t block your view of the road ahead when you drink.\nThe Contigo mug doesn\u2019t keep drinks as hot as the Zojirushi mug, but some of our testers prefer that\u2014we\u2019ve heard many complaints over the years of the Zojirushi mug\u2019s tendency to keep drinks too hot and burn tongues.\nThis mug is hand-wash only, but its lid is dishwasher-safe. The lid has fewer parts than that of the Zojirushi mug, so it is easier to disassemble and hand-wash if you prefer to clean it that way. The lid is not replaceable, but we haven\u2019t encountered any damage after several drops.\nEntertainment\nEdward Abbey wrote an entire book about being alone in the desert, long before portable screens, streaming music, and the best and worst of what instant entertainment can bring. He saw incredible things. But then again, Abbey wrote that book before he had kids.\nBeing in close proximity on a road trip can bond families and friends. Of course, a packed car could also become a pressure cooker. Some games, toys, and electronics can provide welcome relief.\nEven more important, on our trip, every 100 miles the scenery around us changed drastically, and being able to charge our cameras allowed us to capture some wonderful personal moments.\nLots of newer cars have USB ports capable of charging plenty of smaller gadgets. But to plug in bigger items, such as a computer, or certain items that have larger batteries, you need an inverter to transform your car\u2019s round-plug, 12-volt direct current (12 V DC) outlet into a three-prong outlet with the same 120-volt alternating current (120 V AC) you have in your home. After sending our three favorites, culled from a list of 18 top-rated inverters, to physicist Jim Shapiro for testing, we recommend the Bestek 300W Power Inverter for simple devices such as water boilers. Not all inverters are equal, however, and you need to know what you\u2019ll want to plug in before deciding which one to buy.\nThe Bestek unit\u2014like every inverter that sells for less than $100\u2014creates AC power, but in what\u2019s called a \u201cmodified\u201d sine wave. Shapiro examined this phenomenon using an oscilloscope. \u201cAlthough the Bestek and similar units produce voltage at the same 60-hertz frequency as house voltage, the waveform has sharp corners, unlike the smooth, curvy sine-wave signal from your local power company,\u201d Shapiro explained. \u201cThose sharp corners give rise to higher frequency harmonics that are not friendly to electronic devices.\u201d\nHowever, because many electronics, including laptop computers, use power supplies to convert AC back into DC before delivering the power to your device, a higher-quality power supply can make the arrangement work\u2014as owner reviews attest. Shapiro was able to charge an iPad without any problems via the AC outlets on the inexpensive Bestek inverter. Charging a Dell Chromebook, on the other hand, caused some problems: \u201cThe screen flickered, and I noted that when I asked the computer to display the charging time left, it oscillated between giving that time and \u2018calculating,\u2019 indicating that the software was having problems.\u201d\nWhile we were on the road, we realized that the Bestek inverter\u2019s dual USB ports and dual outlets offered a nice benefit, particularly for people traveling in an older car that didn\u2019t have USB ports built in everywhere. You shouldn\u2019t have issues charging USB devices because they charge on DC voltage anyway. And though you can\u2019t see the inverter\u2019s safety features, such as over-voltage and low-voltage shutdown, they\u2019re included as well.\nFor powering a TV (for tailgating) or any other demanding piece of electronics during a road trip, we used to recommend the Go Power GP-SW150-12 Pure Sine Wave Inverter. It now appears to be out of stock almost everywhere (or discontinued). As an alternative, we recommend looking into a portable power station, which is basically a large battery in a protective box, with AC outlets and other ports built in.\nThey tend to be expensive, so for road-trip purposes we recommend the Jackery Explorer 300. We like to bring this compact model to a beach, park, or campsite to inflate an air mattress, run a fan, or charge a phone, camera, portable speaker, lantern, or headlamp. It has two AC outlets, one USB-C port, and two USB-A ports\u2014fewer than our other picks, but still more than most models under 10 pounds that we tried.\nIf you need to power only a laptop during your trip, we have several recommendations for portable laptop chargers. Note that portable power stations and laptop chargers both charge on wall outlets and can\u2019t draw power from a car outlet.\nIf your electronic gear doesn\u2019t require AC\u2014for instance, you\u2019re charging smartphones or Bluetooth speakers more than laptops or portable TVs\u2014you can save a few bucks and a lot of space by getting a car charger. Compared with the familiar USB-A port, the smaller USB-C port can charge most modern phones faster (if you\u2019re using the right cable) and can even charge tablets and laptops. And the Nekteck PD 45W Type-C Car Charger provides the best of both worlds. When you\u2019re using a USB-C\u2013to\u2013Lightning cable, the charger\u2019s USB-C port can charge an iPhone about three times faster (at 18 watts) than the USB-A wall charger that Apple used to package with its phones; your phone can charge from empty to 54% in just half an hour. This Nekteck charger\u2019s 45-watt output and included USB-C\u2013to\u2013C cable also support the maximum charge rate on Android phones, iPads, and even many laptops. And you can use the 12-watt USB-A port at the same time to charge a second phone or other device with any USB cable you already have.\nBluetooth kit\nIf your car lacks Bluetooth support\u2014which you may want for wirelessly listening to music or connecting your phone calls over the car\u2019s stereo system\u2014and you aren\u2019t willing to swap out the stereo for a new one that has such a feature, your best option is a Bluetooth kit. The best and easiest way to add Bluetooth to cars with a line-in jack is to get an aux kit. The Besign BK01 Bluetooth Car Kit provides good sound quality for music, clear-sounding voice audio for hands-free calls, and access to Siri or Google Assistant at the press of a button. It also allows you to connect two phones at once, so you and your passengers don\u2019t have to duke it out for the aux cord.\niPad headrest mount\nDepending on the length of your trip and the temperament of your passengers, you may need to find a way to keep folks occupied. Providing their favorite movies or TV shows on a tablet is an option. After testing six top tablet-mount contenders, we determined that Arkon\u2019s Center Extension Car Headrest Tablet Mount is a great pick for viewing by multiple backseat passengers.\nThe Arkon mount anchors with a pair of adjustable clamps that tighten around the metal rods that support a front seat\u2019s headrest; the tablet holster is located on the end of an extendable pole that you can move to a position between the front seats, where all three passengers in the backseat can view it.\nWe had recommended the LilGadgets CarBuddy Universal Headrest Tablet Mount for people who preferred a mount that\u2019s best for just one backseat passenger. It appears to have been discontinued, but it\u2019s a good find if you can get your hands on one.\nInstant camera\nWith a smartphone, showing a photo to hundreds of followers is as easy as pressing the share button. But if you want to create something tangible, an instant-film camera can add a fun and welcome dose of analog charm to your digital world. The budget pick in our guide to instant cameras is the Fujifilm Instax Mini 12, which provides high-quality, retro-cool prints at a reasonable price.\nAlso, when your phone is serving as a radio, a map, a restaurant guide, and whatever else, you\u2019ll appreciate having a dedicated tool that does one thing: take instant shots that look great.\nAfter doing extensive research, we found the Instax Mini 12 to be a great, affordable instant-film camera. Its compact body feels durable, and thanks to its minimal controls, anyone can easily learn how to use it. The 3.4-by-2.1-inch prints cost only about 60\u00a2 apiece, so documenting your trip won\u2019t break the bank. Its photos aren\u2019t perfectly sharp, but they are pleasingly colorful and creamy, with a classic look that we love.\nTravel game\nYou can find countless travel games for all ages, from magnetic chess boards to Adult Mad Libs, and we\u2019re not about to review them all here. (You know what kinds of games you like to play.) So instead we\u2019ll tell you about the game we chose, Chat Pack: Fun Questions to Spark Conversations.\nI am, as a rule, generally wary of anything designed to prompt conversation. But by day three of our trip, with 1,100 miles behind us and 400 miles ahead, my then girlfriend (now wife) reached for Chat Pack and told me it was time.\nIt\u2019s hit or miss with Chat Pack. Some of the questions are oddly inspiring, if clunkily written: \u201cWhat is one item you own that has virtually no monetary value but has such sentimental value that you would not sell it for $1,000?\u201d So, what item do I have that has no value but remains precious? My grandmother\u2019s wire glove stretchers. And that became an hour-long conversation.\nSome of the questions were abrupt duds: \u201cIf rain could fall in any scent, what scent would you want it to be?\u201d \u201cLike rain,\u201d we both answered. Who doesn\u2019t love the smell of fresh rain? The feeling of camaraderie in the car was strong; we agreed that it was a dumb question. We were a young couple on an open road in full accordance with each other, and that\u2019s not a moment you take lightly.\nSo get a Chat Pack. Your mileage may vary. But this pack helped us pass the time, and it takes up barely any space.\nDetours\nMake time in your trip for the detours. If there\u2019s one bit of non-gear-related advice we can give, it\u2019s that the complicated route always proves to be more interesting. There will be times in the car when a sort of tunnel vision can set in, and the destination becomes all-consuming. At my worst, as I pressed down on the accelerator, I found myself mentally calculating the time saved for every increase in miles per hour\u2014as if the scenery I was flying past wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d come to see in the first place.\nThe first time we pulled over without a plan was on some Bureau of Land Management stretch east of Zion National Park in Utah. We were alone, on an outcropping overlooking a shallow canyon. Someone had built an impromptu fire pit. But somehow it wasn\u2019t until we finished lunch that we realized there was no point in going any farther.\nYou can find many ways to plan a trip. But once in a while, take a risk and make a left when all the maps and devices are telling you to go right. You won\u2019t know where you\u2019ll end up\u2014and that\u2019s the whole point.\nBinoculars\nBinoculars might not be a necessity. But when you\u2019re standing on the edge of a trail in Zion National Park and looking for nesting peregrine falcons or lying at the edge of your campsite in Joshua Tree watching a pack of coyotes move under a full moon, will a good pair of binoculars come in handy? Yes. Yes it will.\nThe waterproof and lightweight Athlon Optics Midas ED binoculars boast a rugged shock-absorbing exterior. And this pair\u2019s optical clarity and extra-wide field of view allow you to see more of the scene, more clearly and accurately. In fact, the professional ornithologist who tested binoculars for us said that things looked every bit as good through the Athlon binoculars as they looked through his $2,500 Leica Ultravid pair.\nAnd the optics of the Midas ED pair aren\u2019t the only strong suit: These are exceptionally durable binoculars that easily withstood the humid, dusty, and hostile environment of the Mexican rain forest and the harsh sun of the Californian desert. Also, their focus dial adjusts reliably and smoothly across a wide range of depths, making it easy for you to focus on what you\u2019re trying to see, no matter where it is.\nStowable tote or daypack\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to have a bag on hand for spontaneous off-the-road excursions. But anything that will take up space on a trip needs to be functional enough to hold cameras, snacks, jackets, maps, and souvenirs. And it needs to be durable enough to survive beach trips, sightseeing excursions, picnics, and museum tours.\nAfter researching dozens of packable daypacks across a spectrum of portability, features, and prices, and then packing, unpacking, loading, wearing, and drenching the top-rated finalists during multiple rounds of testing, we\u2019ve found that the Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Day Pack is the smallest and lightest packable backpack of the bunch. Packed up, it is very discreet, nearly the size of a keychain accessory. The bag itself is a no-frills sack made from a paper-thin siliconized Cordura nylon, so it\u2019s very light and water resistant. The Ultra-Sil bag also has reinforced stitching at stress points, which allows it to carry more weight than you might expect. That said, since this pack is made of such thin, light material, carrying large or awkwardly shaped loads is somewhat uncomfortable, especially in comparison with our more structured picks.\nIf lightness, waterproofing, comfort, and organization are more important to you, check out the alternative picks in our review of packable daypacks for travel.\nSunscreen\nOn most road trips you\u2019ll be exposed to the sun, whether it\u2019s your arm out the window or your legs and neck during a pit stop, so we recommend bringing our favorite sunscreens along for everyone to apply. (The one exception: your youngest passengers. Do not put sunscreen on an infant. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends keeping children who are younger than 6 months out of the sun entirely.)\nAlthough most sunscreens containing only physical UV blockers are notoriously harder to spread and more visible on skin than sunscreens with chemical UV filters, Thrive Bodyshield SPF 50 spreads quickly and absorbs easily for a such a sunscreen. Its feel and appearance on all shades of skin is on par with most chemical sunscreens we\u2019ve considered\u2014with minimal, if any, white cast. This formula contains ingredients known to be safer for marine life, but it\u2019s also suited for daily wear.\nBanana Boat Light As Air Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ is our favorite chemical sunscreen that doesn\u2019t contain oxybenzone. Fairly runny and lightweight, it blends seamlessly into a variety of skin tones. Although it contains added fragrance, it\u2019s not strongly scented. It\u2019s water resistant for up to the maximum-allowable claim (per FDA guidelines) of 80 minutes, and it costs far less per ounce than our physical-sunscreen pick.\nJust in case\nHaving an emergency kit in your car is a great idea for day-to-day driving, but it\u2019s pretty much a necessity for long-distance road trips. Although it\u2019s tempting to buy a preassembled kit and be done with it, we haven\u2019t found a great one yet. Even the most promising options suffer from having jumper cables that are too short, too thin, or both. Basically, if you want a good kit, you have to make it yourself, and we\u2019re here to help.\nWe spent hours researching and testing each of these essentials to confirm that they\u2019ll be useful in case of an emergency, whether it\u2019s your own or someone else\u2019s.\nOn a desolate stretch of two-lane highway in northern Arizona, we were driving behind a rental camper van just as it had a rear-tire blowout after hitting a rumble strip. The couple driving the van couldn\u2019t find their jack, didn\u2019t know where the spare tire was, and had come to a stop just past a low dip in the road. It wasn\u2019t a good scene. But it couldn\u2019t have happened at a better time (for them, at least), and it gave us a great opportunity to put our emergency gear to the test.\nIt\u2019s also wise to get a membership to a roadside assistance program. We don\u2019t have a single best recommendation for everyone, since your options and needs vary depending on what car you have, how you use it, and where you live, but here\u2019s a good guide by Popular Mechanics on what to look for in choosing a plan. Basically, make sure your plan fits your needs. For example, if you live in a city, 3 miles of free towing may be enough. But if you\u2019re going on a road trip across the desert, paying for more range is worthwhile.\nFirst-aid kit\nOn the road, a first-aid kit is useful for keeping someone comfortable until people with real medical expertise can help. It\u2019s much more important to have a basic kit with you\u2014and to be sure that the bandages haven\u2019t degraded and the disinfectants haven\u2019t expired\u2014than to have a 432-item, war-zone-worthy kit sitting at home.\nWe like the First Aid Only 298 Piece All-Purpose First Aid Kit. It lacks some of the higher-quality tools that we recommend for a wilderness first-aid kit, but it comes with plenty of bandages, alcohol prep pads, pain relievers, and equipment to treat up to four people\u2019s minor cuts and scrapes on a weekend trip. (For an extensive list and comparison chart, see our full guide.)\nSnow shovel\nAfter spending two years researching car shovels and testing five contenders, we found that the best one to keep in the trunk for an emergency is the Voil\u00e9 Telepro Mini Avalanche Shovel.\nThe tool, popular with ski patrols and people clearing backcountry trails, has a solid metal scoop and a two-piece handle that clicks together to form a sturdy shovel. Our tester keeps the Voil\u00e9 shovel in her truck every winter, and it has come in handy more times than she can count. Though the Voil\u00e9 shovel is too short to be a primary shovel, it\u2019s perfect for any kind of fast shoveling. When you aren\u2019t using it, you can tuck its three pieces neatly under a car seat or in the back.\nTire gauge\nChecking your car\u2019s tire pressure (including that of the spare tire) is like flossing: It\u2019s something that everyone should do but many people don\u2019t do. Proper inflation is vital. Too much, and you\u2019ll feel every bump and have more difficulty stopping your car; too little, and your tires will wear faster. Worse, they\u2019ll also overheat, which can separate the treads and blow the tires, something we saw happen right in front of us in the middle of nowhere in Arizona. Don\u2019t let that happen to you.\nWhen we asked three different San Francisco Bay Area tire shops which gauge they used, they all pointed to the Accu-Gage 60 PSI gauge with shock protector. After our testing, which included road-tripping with the tool ourselves, the Accu-Gage model has emerged as our favorite tire gauge for several years running. It\u2019s accurate and durable, and unlike a digital gauge, it has no battery to wear out. The Accu-Gage model is available in several different configurations, but the performance is largely the same. We prefer a version with a hose attached and a straight chuck, because that design makes it easier to hold the gauge and check the tire pressure at the same time. The version we tested even comes with a removable rubber bumper in case you drop it.\nPortable jump starter\nA portable jump starter is essentially a lightweight battery attached to two jumper cables that you use to jump-start your car. It\u2019s easier, safer, and less intimidating than old-fashioned jumper cables that you attach to another car\u2014and it\u2019s something that you can use if you\u2019re alone, instead of waiting for roadside service/a kind stranger/a friend/a relative to show up and bail you out.\nWirecutter has recommended Weego gear since we first published our guide to portable jump starters in 2017. Guide writer Mark Smirniotis researched 40 lithium-ion jump starters and tested 12. Two Weego portable jump starters (both of which are now discontinued) became picks: the Weego 22s (the top pick; about $60) and the Weego 44 (the upgrade pick; about $150). Though we no longer maintain that full guide, many of us at Wirecutter still keep a Weego jump starter in our cars. But now, in many cases, it\u2019s an updated version, namely the affordable Weego 44s, which hovers around the same price as the 22s model, its less powerful predecessor.\nMeasuring 5.62 by 3.44 by 1.04 inches (LWD), the Weego 44s jump starter is about the same size as a cell phone in length and width. It also weighs less than a pound (around 12 ounces, according to my kitchen scale) and has safety features that help prevent you from hurting your car or yourself: If you incorrectly attach the jump starter to your battery (which can potentially damage the battery or your car\u2019s electrical system), the unit\u2019s reverse-polarity protection feature activates, issuing a red light and an alarm alerting you not to proceed.\nThe Weego 44s is rated to work with a wide range of vehicles, including gas engines up to 7 liters and diesel engines up to 3.5 liters. It can jump-start pretty much any gas- or diesel-powered passenger-vehicle engine\u2014anything from a Mini Cooper (2 liters or less) to a Dodge Ram (as much as 6.7 liters)\u2014and it fits that power into a package that\u2019s small enough for most glove boxes.\nThe Weego 44s comes partially charged out of the box and takes about 2.5 hours to charge from zero. A USB-A\u2013to\u2013Micro-USB charging cord is included, but it doesn\u2019t come with a charging cube, so you need to plug the USB-A end into your own USB phone charger that works in regular household outlets or use an outlet with a USB-A port. According to the company, the unit can stay charged for more than a year in storage, though you should make sure to top it off every three to six months. With regular use, it\u2019s rated to last for about three to five years or up to 1,000 recharge cycles. Plus, it can provide multiple jumps before it needs a recharge itself (five lights on the side of the unit indicate its remaining battery life).\nThe Weego 44s has checks and balances to ensure that you safely jump-start a car, but its lithium-ion polymer battery comes with certain caveats. Though the manufacturer indicates that the unit will operate in temps of -4 \u00b0F to 140 \u00b0F, leaving it in a car in extremely hot or cold conditions is not a great idea. \u201cMost devices that contain a lithium-ion battery, whether it\u2019s your smartphone or a portable jump starter, should not spend long periods of time in extreme temperatures since it can cause permanent damage to the battery,\u201d says Wirecutter senior staff writer and battery expert Sarah Witman. \u201cYou should also keep in mind that car engines need more power to get started in freezing temperatures, so it\u2019s especially important to keep your jump starter fully charged when driving in cold climates.\u201d\nJumper cables\nIf you\u2019re a die-hard jumper-cable partisan, make sure that the cables you get are long enough for most scenarios and thick enough to carry sufficient current to jump most vehicles.\nAfter scrutinizing the specs of dozens of jumper-cable options and having an electrical engineer analyze three top-rated models, we recommend Lifeline\u2019s AAA Heavy Duty 16-foot 6 Gauge Booster Cables. As this image illustrates, these cables are long and thick enough for most situations, and their 400-amp current rating means they can handle most vehicles, even trucks and SUVs. They also come with a surprisingly sturdy and convenient mesh storage bag.\nOne thing that sets these Lifeline cables apart from other cables we found on Amazon is that the 6-gauge description is accurate. For example, Capri sells a 4-gauge, 20-foot cable that reviewers say is closer to 8-gauge. That\u2019s no good, because thinner cables can fail to deliver sufficient current to start trucks, SUVs, and other larger vehicles.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with how to use jumper cables, familiarize yourself. But lest you forget, Lifeline includes a handy diagram in the bag. The important thing to keep in mind: Do not attach the black clamp to the black post of the dead battery. Instead, clamp it to an unpainted metal surface under the hood. Also, don\u2019t touch the exposed parts of the clamps together while the cables are hooked up to a battery; they will spark.\nTool roll\nIf you don\u2019t own any tools for car maintenance, this kit is a great start. With 65 individual tools, the Decked x BoxoUSA Tool Bag with Tool Roll has nearly every tool that a home mechanic (especially those who own a truck) might need to keep their vehicle on the road. As the kit was designed originally for off-roading, bringing the whole thing and all its contents would be overkill for most people (the entire kit weighs 31 pounds). But selecting the necessities\u2014the ratchet and wrench set, for instance\u2014depending on the kind of journey you\u2019re planning is easy and efficient due to the built-in compartmentalization. Included within the kit are combination wrenches, sockets, impact sockets, hex and torx keys, breaker bars, and a family of hammers, pliers, and screwdrivers. The heavy-duty Cordura nylon bag is built to last, too. If you\u2019re at all interested in doing some of your own car maintenance, or if you want to be prepared in case of emergency, this toolkit offers a solid foundation.\nHeadlamp\nWe\u2019ve been testing headlamps since 2012, including our latest round of research and testing in 2023. For a road trip, we like a headlamp that\u2019s rechargeable, so you won\u2019t ever get caught with a dead battery, as long as you have a USB car charger on hand. Its 400-lumen light ranks among the brightest of all our picks. (Twice during our trip we pulled into our camping site late, and our headlamp was the first thing we reached for. Knowing that it was always charged meant that we didn\u2019t have to hunt for batteries or use our car lights and disturb neighboring campers.)\nThe current version of our longtime top pick, the Black Diamond Spot 400 provides exactly what you need: a bright beam, easy-to-navigate buttons, and long-lasting battery life. The Spot 400 has been at the top of our list since 2012 because it\u2019s reliable and bright enough to light the way in most situations, indoors or outdoors. And since 2023, you\u2019ve been able to buy an add-on rechargeable battery for the Spot 400.\nIts two top buttons are intuitive to use; you have to experiment with clicking through the various modes, but the learning curve is fairly quick. It has a red light (for night use), a \u201cproximity\u201d floodlight (for a wider field of view), and strobe options (for throwing an emergency signal). The Spot 400 weighs 3 ounces, has a lock mode, and is weather resistant.\nAlthough headlamps with brighter, higher-quality beams exist, none offer the same combination of brightness, simplicity, and reliability at such a low price.\nFlare alternative\nTo keep yourself safe while your car is parked on the side of the road, we suggest StonePoint LED Emergency Beacon flare alternatives.\nWe like the StonePoint set because, for the price of one high-intensity model like the PowerFlare device, you get three separate lights that are all crushproof to 20,000 pounds, waterproof, magnetic, and easy to set up and turn on. The magnets are important because they let you mount the beacons on your car, which adds height; having a flare anywhere above the surface of the road greatly increases your visibility. By putting one on the road (preferably elevated on something and located about 100 feet before your car), another on the trunk, and another on the hood, you create a very visible early warning for drivers.\nTraditional magnesium flares will almost always be brighter and more visible. But their hazards\u2014both to your health and to the environment around you\u2014are substantial. (Read the health and environmental hazards section in this report [PDF] for a breakdown of the risks and the potentially harmful chemicals involved.) Combine that with the fact that you can mitigate any differences in visibility simply by elevating an electric flare, and you end up with a compelling argument against using traditional flares.\nOf the three beacon models we tested, we couldn\u2019t figure out how to open or turn on the Wagan model. And the Smittybilt U.F.O. safety light, though tough, wasn\u2019t especially effective during the day and came only one to a package. Only the StonePoint beacons were easy to fill with batteries and place on the road exactly when we needed them. They also happened to be the brightest flare alternatives we had with us.\nI should take a moment here and repeat what the responding officer told us when he arrived on the scene. Regardless of what safety beacons you have laid out behind you, \u201cStay off the road, and when in doubt stay in your car.\u201d\nMulti-tool\nNo emergency kit is complete without a multi-tool. Most minor situations\u2014such as a loose Phillips-head screw or a need to create a rag for checking your oil\u2014are easily fixed as long as you have the right tool. Multi-tools are small enough to carry in a jeans pocket or to attach to a belt, so you can take a set of useful tools almost anywhere. Our choice is the Leatherman Skeletool CX, which comes with pliers, a bit driver, a pocket clip, and a carabiner/bottle opener, in addition to a high-quality, 2.6-inch 154CM carbon-fiber stainless steel blade. The Skeletool CX stood out from the other 22 multi-tools we tested because it focuses on the functionality, ergonomics, and solid construction of a few essential tools, instead of cramming dozens of different tools into a single bulky body that makes it difficult to use. That means it\u2019s easy to carry but still has just about everything you could possibly need (short of a hammer and a socket set) to make an emergency repair in the field and on the road.\nDuct tape\nIf you can\u2019t duct it, fuhgeddaboudit. We tested the heck out of 11 rolls of duct tape and chose Duck Brand Max Strength tape above the competition for its perfect blend of attributes, namely high material strength, a strong adhesive, and superior overall flexibility for easy wrapping around odd shapes and curved surfaces. Is it an absolute necessity on the road? No. But the moment you need to fix a ripped tent wall or to keep unruly motel shades shut, you\u2019ll be glad you packed some duct tape. It can even handle first-aid duties when the right materials for the job are unavailable. Duct tape is, as any MacGyver fan will tell you, a very useful tool.\nWater jug\nThe general rule for water in an emergency is that one person needs one gallon of water for one day. But four to five gallons is a good amount to throw into your trunk\u2014enough to get you through being stranded, even with a passenger. You should increase that estimate if you plan to go out in the middle of nowhere, or if your travels take you to a desert region or some other dry place. We found on our trip through the Southwest that we were refilling our water bottles a lot more than we were stopping for gas.\nAfter researching 16 different types of water jugs, we recommend the Reliance 4-Gallon Aqua-Tainer for most situations. The Reliance jug has two standout features: a screw-on vent cap and a spigot cap that reverses in on itself when not in use. These features work together to prevent major spills. The screw-on vent cap doesn\u2019t come undone, unlike the pull-top vents on some competitors, which tend to pop open and spill water as soon as you hit anything other than the smoothest roadways. Spigot caps can be a weakness for some jugs, too. In contrast, when not in use, the Reliance jug\u2019s spigot unscrews and drops into the jug itself, sealing up the whole canister nice and tight. On our road trip, we used the 4-Gallon Aqua-Tainer, which can provide water for two people for two days; for more people, consider the 7-Gallon Aqua-Tainer.\nThe Reliance Aqua-Tainer jug is made from BPA-free molded plastic. It\u2019s easy to pack around in the trunk of a car\u2014certainly easier than large, bladder-type jugs (like the MSR Dromedary Bag), which, though excellent for camp showers and good for a backpack, are too difficult to pack around in a trunk because of their non-rigid shape. The Aqua-Tainer\u2019s hard sides also make it easier to use for dispensing water from, say, the roof of your car. But be sure to throw a shirt or towel under the Aqua-Tainer before setting it atop your car like this: We learned the hard way that the molded plastic edge can scratch your car\u2019s paint job if you\u2019re not careful.\nAvoid gallon jugs, since they\u2019re typically made out of HDPE plastic, which punctures easily. (Such jugs also have caps that pop off easily.) We wouldn\u2019t buy collapsible jugs, either, since they are prone to leaks and are unruly when pouring.\nPreparing for a road trip\nIt takes only a few minutes to get your vehicle checked out for a proper road trip. When in doubt, or when preparing for an especially long trip, see a mechanic first. There are plenty of potential mechanical troubles that a professional can identify\u2014and that you\u2019d rather learn about in their shop than on the side of a highway. Use these tips to determine where to go for help, based on the age of your car and what you need done.\n- Dealership service departments: newer vehicles covered by factory warranty, or when specialized service is required\n- Independent mechanics: general maintenance items such as brakes, steering, suspension, exhaust, and fluid changes\n- Quick oil/lube centers: oil changes only\nGetting word-of-mouth advice from family and friends remains a very good way to find reputable mechanics. Sites such as RepairPal and Yelp are also helpful. And don\u2019t forget to check local Facebook community groups.\nThe vehicle inspection: Six key areas\n- Under the hood: Check the engine oil, transmission fluid, engine coolant, windshield wipers, washer fluid, and brake fluid.\n- Tires: Check for proper inflation and good tread that doesn\u2019t show uneven wear. For inflation, consult your owner\u2019s manual to find your tires\u2019 recommended PSI; don\u2019t go by what\u2019s printed on the side of your tire, which is the maximum PSI. For tread wear, stick a penny into the center (not the edge) of each tire\u2019s treads, with Lincoln\u2019s head facing down\u2014if you can still see the top of Lincoln\u2019s head, the tire is worn out. Also, if you have a spare tire, check it and make sure that a jack and a lug-nut wrench still accompany it. If you don\u2019t have a spare, consider getting one from a dealer or a salvage yard. Or invest in an emergency roadside repair and inflation kit\u2014like the Slime 50107 Smart Spair Emergency Tire Repair Kit\u2014which includes sealant for small punctures as well as a small air compressor for reinflating tires. At the very least, bring along a portable sealer kit like Fix-A-Flat, but be aware that these options work only on very small punctures in the tread and could ultimately require you to replace your whole tire. So it\u2019s really better to have a spare, if possible.\n- Lights: Check all the bulbs, including the turn signals, headlights (high and low beam), brake lights, parking lamps, reverse lights, and license-plate lights.\n- Smell test: You can sniff out potential problems in your car by paying attention to its odors.\n- Sulfur/rotten-egg smell: You have trouble with your exhaust or emission system that could be dangerous. Get your car to a mechanic immediately.\n- Sweet smell: This scent indicates an engine coolant leak; the smell could be strong when you\u2019re using the heater, and accompanied by fogged-up glass. The coolant is toxic, and when it runs out, your engine will overheat.\n- Burning carpet/paper smell: Your brakes are hot. Smelling this after you\u2019ve used your brakes hard (such as after coming down a mountain) is not unusual. But if you smell this while you\u2019re driving around normally, it means your brakes might be stuck, which is a serious problem.\n- Musty/mildew smell: This odor is generally attributable to water getting stuck in the ductwork for your heating and air conditioning. It usually indicates that a drain plug is blocked, which you sometimes can fix just by running your fan on high for a few minutes.\n- Burning rubber smell: Unless you\u2019re doing burnouts, this smell can be caused by slipping engine belts or a tire rubbing. In these cases, the smell is usually accompanied by a noise, namely squealing (with belts) or grinding (with a tire rubbing).\n- Noise test: Cars make lots of noises, and the following are some that should get your undivided attention.\n- Clunking or rattling over bumps: This sound can indicate a variety of problems with the steering or suspension, but it often points to worn plastic or rubber bushings that allow contact between metal components. In extreme cases, these components can fail, causing major damage or even loss of control if the vehicle is moving.\n- Clicking or groaning sounds when turning: Clicking is a sign of imminent axle shaft failure on front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive vehicles, so get to a mechanic immediately if you hear this sound. Groaning noises are less serious and occur because of a lack of lubrication in steering components or bushings.\n- Loud humming that increases steadily with speed: This sound almost always points to a bad wheel bearing, especially if the noise gets louder or quieter when the car is turning.\n- Grinding, squeaking, or squealing when stopping: Squeaking and squealing happen when the brake pads are worn and need replacing. Grinding means the pads are already gone, and you\u2019re pushing metal against metal when you stop.\n- Feel test: The following are a few situations that should warrant a visit to the shop.\n- Soft or spongy brake pedal: Brakes should be firm; a soft pedal means something is wrong. Either you have a mechanical problem or the brake fluid is leaking.\n- Shimmies or vibrations: These sensations usually indicate that a rim is bent or that a tire is out of balance, but they can also be signs of loose steering or suspension parts.\nPre-trip planning\nBefore heading out, check these commonly taken-for-granted aspects of road-tripping.\n- Update your GPS system. Factory-installed GPS devices generally receive updates once a year and require CDs, SD cards, or USB thumb drives purchased from the manufacturer for installation through a dealership. Mobile third-party GPS units get updates throughout the year, and you can install the updates via most home PCs through a simple download from the GPS manufacturer\u2019s website.\n- Make sure that you have maps or a paper atlas. Sometimes technology fails. Having a current map for backup is always a good idea.\n- Make sure you\u2019re covered by a roadside assistance program. Auto-club programs are the most common source of roadside assistance plans, with companies such as AAA and Good Sam offering coverage to members regardless of what vehicle they drive or its age. Most new cars, however, come with complimentary roadside assistance that lasts a certain number of miles or a certain number of years, whichever happens first. So check your owner\u2019s manual (and read the fine print, since these plans can be very limited). Many auto insurance companies also provide vehicle-specific roadside assistance, usually for a monthly fee. Some credit card companies offer a mix of complimentary and basic fee services, and even cell phone companies are now offering basic services to customers. Verizon\u2019s roadside assistance plan costs $5 per month and covers any vehicle, as long as the phone is present. Most of these plans have limitations and plenty of fine print to study, so carefully review your coverage before hitting the road.\nThis article was edited by Ria Misra and Christine Ryan.\nMentioned above\n- After extensive research and field testing, we found that the Graco SnugRide SnugFit 35 DLX is the best infant car seat for most families.The Best Infant Car Seats\n- After testing 17 lightweight, portable car seats, we have six good options for infants, toddlers, and big kids to recommend.The Best Travel Car Seats\n- After researching over 50 booster car seats and testing 13, we\u2019ve concluded that the convenient Chicco KidFit ClearTex Plus is the best overall choice.The Best Booster Car Seats\n- Our picks include metal and plastic water bottles that are easy to use, a cinch to clean, and the least likely to leak.The Best Kids Water Bottles\n- The right pair of sunglasses will protect your eyes while broadcasting your own personal style.

      "text": "The Best Carry-On Travel Backpacks\nWhen you open your favorite carry-on travel backpack, it should feel like you\u2019re opening the door to a well-organized closet or sitting down at a clean desk, with everything in the right place and easy to reach.\nThis is your moment to center yourself, no matter how chaotic the journey.\nThe Cotopaxi Allpa 35L Del Dia Travel Pack and the larger Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L offer the best combination of features, quality, and durability. Both bags are exemplary carry-on travel backpacks that are designed for comfort, durability, and organization. Though these backpacks are great as companion bags for any trip, they\u2019re designed to replace all of your other luggage and become your exclusive bag as you travel.\nThis style of packing is not for everyone, but once some people try it, they\u2019re forever hooked. Finding the right bag is a personal choice, though, and no single bag appeals to everyone. That\u2019s why we also have picks that are great for people who travel for work, others that are designed to be carried over long distances, and a bag that\u2019s basically luggage on your back.\nWhat we considered\n- 45- or 35-liter bag\nA 45-liter bag maximizes overhead space but can get heavy when fully packed; a 35-liter bag tends to be more manageable.\n- How it packs\nA bag with a clamshell design opens like a book and is easier to pack, but a bag that opens traditionally usually has more structure.\n- Multiple handles\nIdeally, a travel backpack has handles on all sides\u2014especially the bottom\u2014so you can pull it out of overhead bins or from under seats.\n- Organization\nSome internal pockets are useful, but major organizing is better managed with packing cubes.\nEverything we recommend\nThe research\n- Why you should trust us\n- Who this is for\n- Should you get a 45- or 35-liter bag?\n- Best small carry-on travel backpack for most situations: Cotopaxi Allpa 35L Travel Pack Del Dia\n- Best large carry-on travel backpack for most situations: Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L\n- Best backpack for working out of: Patagonia Black Hole MLC 45L\n- Best backpack for long journeys on foot: Osprey Farpoint 40 and Fairview 40\n- Best backpack for dedicated single-bag travelers: Tortuga Travel Backpack Pro 40L\n- Other carry-on travel backpacks worth considering\n- How we picked and tested\n- The competition\n- What to look forward to\n- Sources\nWhy you should trust us\nI've been covering aspects of luggage and travel bag design for Wirecutter for nearly a decade, and I have personally researched, tested, and compared hundreds of bags in that time. I try to do most of my travel with a single backpack, whenever possible. I spent nine months roaming around Hawaii with not much more than that, and I spent another six months nomadically couch-surfing in New York City.\nOver the years, for this guide:\n- We\u2019ve spoken or emailed with writers and travelers who carry everything they need in a single bag: Eytan Levy, the owner and operator of the Snarky Nomad travel website; James Feess, founder of The Savvy Backpacker; and Sharon Gourlay, of the Where\u2019s Sharon? travel website. I also spoke with moderators of Reddit\u2019s r/onebag and r/heronebag forums, as well as with Chase Reeves, bag fanatic, reviewer, and owner of Matterful.\n- I\u2019ve personally adopted these bags for my travel about 90% of the time that I travel anywhere from Hawaii, putting in several thousand miles of air travel and road travel with all our picks.\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nWho this is for\nI researched and tested bags designed for people who want to travel light and stay flexible while flying, without the burden of checking luggage. For some travelers, the challenge of cutting down a packing list is intimidating. But if you can get past that initial hurdle, traveling with a single bag is a revelation: With fewer items, you have more time to concentrate on and appreciate the journey.\n- When you\u2019re not loaded down by heavy luggage, it\u2019s easy to remain more mobile. And it\u2019s easier to adjust your plans midtrip. If you\u2019re willing to do laundry on the road, one bag is all you need to travel indefinitely. At its heart, one-bag travel allows you to discover more\u2014not just about the places you\u2019re going but also about yourself and what you really need day to day.\n- Size and weight still matter. If you desire more creature comforts or more gear, or if you plan to be away for a long time across multiple climates, you should choose a bigger travel backpack. Those larger bags tend not to be carry-on-friendly, however, especially in Europe, so be prepared to check them.\n- No single backpack is perfect for everyone. Before you make any purchase, consider some basic points. How much can you carry? Where do you usually visit: the city or the outback? Travel gear should feel like a welcome companion, there to support you when you need it but unobtrusive when you don\u2019t.\nShould you get a 45- or 35-liter bag?\nFor the most part, carry-on travel backpacks come in two standard sizes: the allowable-overhead-space-maximizing 45 liters and the slightly more diminutive but (for many people) more practical 35 liters. I selected picks in both sizes, as well as one that expands when necessary.\nI personally choose a 35-liter bag for most trips lasting around a week, but for heavier packers or people making longer trips, a 45-liter bag may be preferable.\nBest small carry-on travel backpack for most situations: Cotopaxi Allpa 35L Travel Pack Del Dia\nThe Cotopaxi Allpa 35L Del Dia Travel Pack is an easy-to-organize, comfortable-to-carry bag for getaways lasting just a few days or a whole week.\nIt\u2019s one bag that can do it all. This is a great all-around bag for any traveler who\u2019s dedicated to packing light, or for a smaller person who wants less to carry. This bag has handles on three sides, so it\u2019s easy to grab no matter where you\u2019ve stowed it; a handle pass-through lets you attach it to carry-on luggage, as well. It\u2019s also protected by a full lifetime warranty, and it has the build quality to back that up. After more than seven years of testing, I\u2019ve found that this single backpack (plus a personal item) has replaced nearly every travel bag or piece of luggage I use.\nIt comes in various sizes, but the middle-of-the-road version is the best. Cotopaxi also makes the Allpa in 28-liter and 42-liter sizes. But for us, the 35-liter bag is the best option. The 42-liter version became heavy for our testers to carry when fully packed, and we\u2019d prefer to see a more-robust hip belt on that bag. The 28-liter bag was a touch small for our testers, and its internal organization seemed a little much for shorter trips, such as an overnight jaunt. Cotopaxi also makes a hip pack that\u2019s designed to fit snugly into the Allpa bag\u2019s front top compartment. It\u2019s a neat little addition to the bag, and it\u2019s worth getting if you like wearing fanny packs while you travel.\nIts materials are strong. The Allpa pack is made with 100% recycled 840-denier ripstop nylon. (Denier is a measure of a fabric\u2019s fiber thickness.) The material feels similar to a strong canvas, but it has a more prominent weave. This is the type of bag that\u2019s as easy to slide into an overhead compartment as it is to toss into the back of a rusty pickup truck. It also comes with a rain fly, a unique feature in this category.\nCotopaxi makes the Allpa pack with either a TPU (nylon bonded with a water-resistant polyurethane membrane) or classic nylon construction on the back of the bag. We\u2019ve tested both styles over the years. Although TPU provides additional water resistance, we found over time that the original TPU-coated fabric that Cotopaxi used had a tendency to break down. When we tested the updated version in 2024, Cotopaxi had changed the fabric to address this issue. We\u2019re continuing to test the new bags to see how they last.\nIt\u2019s organized. The Allpa bag has a clamshell design, so it opens like a hard-sided suitcase\u2014a large YKK zipper (the industry leader) runs around three sides of the bag, allowing it to fall open into two halves when you unzip it. On the right side is a deep compartment that\u2019s spacious enough for two large packing cubes or half a suitcase\u2019s worth of clothing, which you access through a mesh zippered flap. On the left, you\u2019ll find space for one more medium-size packing cube behind a zippered flap. Above that are two smaller pockets with high-visibility backing\u2014useful when you\u2019re looking for hard-to-differentiate personal items. Cotopaxi has added a stretch mesh pocket for a water bottle up to 1 liter.\nIt\u2019s secure but still accessible. The Allpa pack has two side-access zippers, which are great for on-the-go access, especially when the bag is hanging from your shoulder. One of them reveals a flat computer pocket with a padded false bottom, so if you drop the bag, it won\u2019t land on the corner of your computer. The other reveals a \u201csecret\u201d pocket with a hidden zipper and access to the main compartment. All of the main-compartment zippers are protected by security loops, which you thread the zipper through at the end of its run; doing so prevents anyone from subtly or quickly grabbing a zipper and opening your bag when you aren\u2019t paying attention.\nIt\u2019s comfortable to carry. The Allpa bag\u2019s hip belt\u2014which you can stow while the bag is on your back\u2014is good enough that it\u2019s comfortable to wear when you need it. With or without the hip belt, the Allpa bag is comfortable to carry over long distances. However, folks who have longer torsos (over 19 inches) may find that the waist belt sits a little high off the hips, unless you fully extend the shoulder straps. Speaking of shoulder straps, unlike the ones on our other picks, the Allpa bag\u2019s straps are contoured to fit both people who have large chests and those with small chests. It isn\u2019t a specifically gendered design, but our female tester noticed the improvement right away.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nThough this pack is well organized for packing, it\u2019s less ideal as a mobile office. The Allpa pack has a minimal amount of administrative organization\u2014places to keep pens and papers, spaces to hold tickets, and so forth. This is where a good personal item comes in handy. However, if you want to travel with just this one bag, it has a few nooks you can hide things in. And the front organizer is deep enough that you can fit several small organizing pouches, if you want, or the aforementioned fanny pack.\nCapacity: 35 liters\nWeight: 2 pounds 7 ounces\nMain-compartment access: clamshell opening\nColors: assorted\nBest large carry-on travel backpack for most situations: Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L\nThe Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L is a good choice if you carry more or have expensive gear\u2014especially camera gear.\nOne bag provides many configurations. Some bags in this category are built to do one thing extremely well: be carried on your back. But the Peak Design Travel Backpack 45L is built to adapt. It\u2019s the Swiss Army knife of backpacks\u2014it\u2019s adjustable, customizable, and (if you spring for the extra cubes and organizers) an almost perfect system for a photographer or gearhead on the move. Most bags\u2019 expanding mechanisms aren\u2019t worth the extra zipper they\u2019re built on, and they look about as attractive as a boiled ham splitting out of its plastic packaging. That\u2019s not the case with this Peak Design bag, which looks just as good fully packed at 45 liters as it does compressed to a 30-liter daypack.\nIt\u2019s expandable, with clever folds and zippers. You can access the bag through a back panel, which doubles as a computer and tablet pouch, as well as a front one (if you unzip the pass-through divider). You can also get into the main compartment via two wing-like trapezoidal flaps, which run along each side of the pack. In its natural shape, the Travel Backpack holds 35 liters, but an expansion zipper allows the bag to swell to 45 liters. If you want to use the bag as a daypack, you fold in the top corners and snap them down, reducing the bag\u2019s volume to a slim 30 liters; in this configuration, it still feels larger than a normal daypack, but we think that\u2019s a small compromise for the ability to use one backpack as both your travel bag and your daily explorer. The bag itself consists of 400-denier nylon and polyester fabrics. It feels tough but not as tough as some other bags we\u2019ve tested, such as the Cotopaxi Allpa pack.\nIt has fold-away straps for easier storage. You can tuck the shoulder and hip straps away when you\u2019re not using them. But unlike any other bag we\u2019ve ever tested, this pack has magnetic flaps on the back panel that open and close with an almost magical snap. Once you\u2019ve played with them, you\u2019ll wonder why every backpack doesn\u2019t have something similar. (A small, childish part of me still gets excited about tucking away the straps when I put the Peak Design bag into an overhead bin.) Although the straps are thin, they\u2019re still comfortable. The hip belt isn\u2019t quite as plush as the one on the Tortuga pack; still, even when the Peak Design bag is fully loaded, the belt doesn\u2019t pinch or dig into the body.\nIt\u2019s great for carrying expensive gear. If you travel with a camera, you don\u2019t have to use Peak Design\u2019s Camera Cubes, but they do make carrying that gear a whole lot easier. The cubes come in five sizes, and if you situate them properly in the bag with the provided clips, they line up with the Travel Backpack\u2019s side-access flaps for quick access. Caleigh Waldman (a photographer for this guide and, full disclosure, my spouse) took this bag across the country for a wedding shoot. \u201cI want this backpack,\u201d she said after three weeks of travel. \u201cI want to travel with it everywhere. With my cameras. Without my cameras. It doesn\u2019t matter. I want to travel with it.\u201d\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt\u2019s expensive. That\u2019s especially true if you commit to Peak Design\u2019s entire system of packing and camera cubes.\nMore complexity means more things that can break. The bag\u2019s adjustable design and multiple zippers certainly add complexity, and complexity adds potential weaknesses. Peak Design covers all of its bags with a lifetime warranty, which should alleviate most people\u2019s concerns. But if you\u2019re particularly hard on your gear and still need to carry as much as possible, you might consider the Tortuga bag instead.\nCapacity: 45 liters\nWeight: 4 pounds 8 ounces\nMain-compartment access: back-panel loader\nColor: black, sage\nBest backpack for working out of: Patagonia Black Hole MLC 45L\nIf you travel often for business and prefer a bag that\u2019s much easier to work out of than most of our other picks, you may like the Patagonia Black Hole MLC 45L. This bag has a front panel and assorted pockets that make it feel like a small traveling office.\nIt\u2019s built like luggage but organized like your office. Of all the bags we recommend, the Black Hole MLC (short for Maximum Legal Carry) comes closest to being a suitcase on your back, due to its large size, simple interior, and minimal external features. The Black Hole MLC is also one of the simplest bags we tested, divided into two (imagine a book with only one page), with a main compartment for packing and a second compartment for document organization and tech storage. The Black Hole MLC has a built-in laptop compartment that fits 17-inch laptops and is situated close to your back to protect the computer and keep its weight closer to your body.\nDespite its size, it\u2019s comfortable enough to carry. Most carry-on backpacks of this size, without frames, become somewhat unwieldy when fully packed. Thankfully, the Black Hole MLC, like the Cotopaxi Allpa, is a welcome exception to this rule. The Black Hole MLC has two shoulder straps, a hip belt, and an optional shoulder strap for easy carrying. When the straps are not in use, or when you\u2019re checking your bag, you can stow them away easily. In my experience, when the bag was fully loaded, it was pleasant to carry\u2014not as comfortable as the Peak Design bag or the Osprey pack, but decent enough. I wouldn\u2019t want to carry it all day across a city, but I wouldn\u2019t mind carrying it through an airport to a car and to a hotel.\nIt\u2019s built from high-quality materials, with durability in mind. This pack is made from recycled polyester, and the fabric is woven in a cross-weave that\u2019s similar to what Patagonia uses in its long-lasting Black Hole series of duffle bags. This is a material I\u2019ve come across a bunch with Patagonia gear, and I\u2019ve tested it thoroughly; it\u2019s very tough. The front of the bag is coated in a weather-resistant TPU for extra protection from the elements. The bag has large YKK zippers and smaller YKK zippers throughout. Unlike the Cotopaxi Allpa pack, this Patagonia bag has no security loops.\nIt comes with one of the best repair programs and a lifetime warranty. Similar to our other picks, the Black Hole MLC is backed by an excellent lifetime warranty. And we\u2019ve always found that Patagonia\u2019s repair program goes above and beyond those of other, comparable companies.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIts 45-liter capacity may be intimidating for some people. And there is no alternative. We wish this bag (despite its \u201cMaximum Legal Carry\u201d name) came in a few more sizes.\nCapacity: 45 liters\nWeight: 3 pounds 10 ounces\nMain-compartment access: clamshell\nColors: tan, black, olive, green\nBest backpack for long journeys on foot: Osprey Farpoint 40 and Fairview 40\nUpdated in 2023, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and Osprey Fairview 40 packs are both built around a hiking backpack frame that\u2019s easy to carry over long distances. (For simplicity\u2019s sake, everything we say here about the Farpoint bag also applies to the Fairview bag.)\nIt\u2019s built for travel but designed for hiking. The Farpoint bag is well made, easy to pack, and comfortable to carry over most midlength distances, such as when you\u2019re walking across a city for an afternoon. Osprey makes excellent backpacks for hauling around, and its lifetime warranty is renowned within the industry. The pack also has an optional messenger-bag-style strap, which offers some flexibility when you\u2019re maneuvering tight spaces like subways or crowded city centers.\nIt\u2019s simple to pack, but not as spacious as it seems. Opening the bag reveals a clamshell design; it\u2019s deep enough to accommodate most large items, yet you won\u2019t have to fumble awkwardly with zippers once you need to close up the bag. The experience is not unlike when you\u2019re packing a bit of sturdy luggage, and that\u2019s something we love about bags like this one\u2014especially when you use packing cubes. Osprey says that this bag, fully packed, can carry 40 liters. But after using the Farpoint pack for a few years, we\u2019ve decided that its rounded shape seems to cut into that theoretical packable space more than in other bags; in practice, the Farpoint\u2019s available space is closer to, but still less than, that of the Cotopaxi Allpa.\nIt\u2019s the easiest bag to carry among our picks. Like all Osprey bags, the Farpoint 40 has notably comfortable shoulder straps. The years of design and consideration that Osprey has invested into its hiking backpacks are quite evident in the Farpoint 40. After more than seven years of long-term testing this bag, we\u2019re still surprised by how great it feels to wear when fully packed. Crucially, the straps stow away neatly behind a zippered panel. However, when you\u2019re using the shoulder straps, the design forces you to also use the hip straps. Though this isn\u2019t a huge issue, if you prefer a sleeker look or would rather have the option of using shoulder straps without hip straps, the Cotopaxi Allpa is more flexible, and it lets you hide the waist straps while the bag is on your back.\nThe Fairview 40 has the same features, in a scaled-down size. Although the Farpoint 40 and the Fairview 40 basically have the same design, the Fairview pack is made for someone with a more-diminutive torso. It\u2019s also slightly lighter. It has all the features and durability of the Farpoint bag, and it also has the same hip belt and adjustability. On both models, the chest-strap clip is equipped with a small security whistle that\u2019s surprisingly loud; it\u2019s a handy feature for anyone traveling in unfamiliar environments.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIts sleek look cuts into the interior space. For a smaller carry-on travel backpack, this one has little to dislike. However, we do wish Osprey would trade some of the sleeker contours for a little more interior space.\nCapacity: 35 liters\nWeight, Farpoint: 3 pounds 3 ounces\nWeight, Fairview: 3 pounds 2 ounces\nMain-compartment access: front-panel loader\nColors, Farpoint: green (Gopher), gray (Tunnel Vision), blue (Muted Space), black\nColors, Fairview: blue (Winter Night), green-blue (Night Jungle), red (Zircon), black\nBest backpack for dedicated single-bag travelers: Tortuga Travel Backpack Pro 40L\nThe Tortuga Travel Backpack Pro 40L maximizes packing space in a bag that\u2019s durable, water-resistant, and customizable to fit most torso lengths, with plenty of organizational features to suit any digital nomad.\nIt\u2019s like a suitcase, with backpack straps. This Tortuga bag is a nearly perfect blend of backpack and luggage. On the outside, its tear-resistant sailcloth and sealed zippers provide ample protection from sharp objects and the elements. Opening the main clamshell zipper reveals a cavernous interior and a few organizational features that make the bag a cinch to pack. The front panel is a particular standout, great for keeping track of electronics and chargers. Of all the bags we tested, this Tortuga pack strikes the closest balance between the carrying comfort of a hiking backpack and the space and organization of a piece of luggage. (Tortuga also makes a lighter model called the Travel Backpack Lite 40L, but we prefer the robustness of the Travel Backpack Pro.)\nIt\u2019s as easy to pack as luggage. When it comes to packing, the Tortuga pack has a soothingly minimal interior, as any good suitcase should. In addition to the bag\u2019s cavernous main pocket, its interior lid has a large vented panel. The panel is too narrow to hold additional packing cubes, but it\u2019s great for holding light jackets, say, or doubling as a dirty-laundry bag (if you\u2019re especially committed to one-bag travel). This pack is available in a 40-liter version (the maximum capacity for a carry-on bag), which we tested; Tortuga also sells a 30-liter version, which is compliant with some intra-European flights. The more-diminutive version is a decent choice for weekend travel or for minimalist travelers\u2014but for those situations, we prefer the space-saving profile and extra internal organization of the Cotopaxi Allpa 35L.\nIt\u2019s very customizable. The Tortuga pack is the most adjustable model we tested, thanks to its adjustable torso length, shoulder straps, and waist-belt system. The adjustable strap system lets you manipulate the location of the shoulder straps (video) to fit a wider variety of body sizes, on both the 30- and 40-liter versions. Of the packs we\u2019ve tested, this one (with its included load-adjuster straps at the top, to prevent the bag\u2019s weight from sagging toward your lumbar region) is the best at distributing its weight (4.5 pounds when empty\u2014roughly 1.5 pounds more than most of our other picks, except the Peak Design pack). You can remove the hip straps if you need to, but the shoulder straps are not stowable.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIts straps don\u2019t stow away. Some people, especially those who are hard on their gear, may consider the inability to remove or stow the shoulder straps (in contrast to the option on our other picks, such as the Cotopaxi Allpa) a disqualifying factor. After years of testing, traveling with, and occasionally checking our Tortuga bag, we haven\u2019t had an issue. However, if the mysterious path of your bag through the airport once you\u2019ve checked it also makes you nervous, you might prefer one of our picks with easy-to-stow straps, such as the Peak Design pack.\nIt's heavy. We\u2019ve fielded complaints from some testers who said that older models of this bag were too heavy for them to carry, even with the padded hip belt and adjustable straps. That extra padding does add weight. At 4.5 pounds, the latest Tortuga bag is more than half a pound lighter than previous versions\u2014the difference is noticeable\u2014and it weighs the same as the equally large Peak Design pack. If you think you would struggle carrying the Tortuga pack, we strenuously encourage you to consider one of our more-manageable picks, such as the Cotopaxi Allpa 35L.\nCapacity: 40 liters\nWeight: 4 pounds 8 ounces\nMain-compartment access: clamshell opening\nColor: black\nOther carry-on travel backpacks worth considering\nIf you want to travel like a backpacker but also fit in at a board meeting (and you have the budget for it): Consider the Tom Bihn Aeronaut 45. This bag\u2019s reputation for durability, adaptability, and a low-key aesthetic make it a favorite among many dedicated one-bag travelers. After testing it, we think it\u2019s a great bag, too. That said, for this bag to really stand out against other backpacks\u2014and for you to take full advantage of its carrying adaptability\u2014you need to buy the internal frame, the hip belt, and (if you\u2019re traveling with a suit or jacket) the shoulder strap as well.\nFor a bag that already costs $340 on its own, all of that adds up. Everything about the Tom Bihn bag (the fabric, the zippers, the quality of construction) feels like an upgrade from other bags, but it\u2019s simply too pricey, and its design is too rarified and specific for most people. The biggest flaw\u2014apart from the price\u2014is that the Tom Bihn bag lacks a dedicated laptop pocket. In its place, the company sells a laptop sleeve (a fine version if you don\u2019t have one) that clips into the bag\u2019s central compartment. Not everyone needs a dedicated laptop pocket, but we prefer the more secure feeling of bags that do.\nHow we picked and tested\nWe\u2019ve narrowed our specifications for a great carry-on travel backpack to the following list of features, ordered from most relevant to least:\nFront- or back-panel loader or clamshell opening for the main compartment: As with any good piece of luggage, with this type of bag, you should be able to open it and see everything you\u2019ve packed. When you have a bag with a panel-loading or clamshell design\u2014rather than a traditional, top-opening design\u2014you can pack it and unpack it just as you would a suitcase.\n- Backpack strap comfort and design: You never know when you\u2019ll be walking farther with your bag than you\u2019d intended. The more comfortable and well designed the straps are, the easier traveling is. \u201cIdeally, you want a bag\u2019s shoulder straps to adjust to the angle of your shoulders,\u201d said Eytan Levy of Snarky Nomad. \u201cGood shoulder straps are the difference between an easy trip and a hard trip.\u201d\n- Hip-belt comfort and design: A hip belt transfers heavy loads from your back and shoulders onto your hips, letting your legs\u2014not your back\u2014bear the brunt of the weight. Just having a waist belt is a plus, but having a padded and sculpted one\u2014especially on bags with over 40 liters of volume\u2014makes a world of difference.\n- Material quality: Durability is critical for any type of luggage, but especially for a backpack that will be your only bag. Most bags worth considering are made of nylon, which resists abrasion more than polyester fabrics of similar density. Spending more, however, can get you exotic, light, and strong materials, such as Dyneema or sailcloth.\n- Weight: Once the bags arrived, we weighed each one ourselves. Most of the bags weighed within a few pounds of one another. But unless you\u2019re very strict with yourself, by the time you\u2019ve packed for a two-week journey, all bags feel equally massive, even if one is just 2 pounds heavier than another when empty.\n- Stowable straps: These are nice to have, but they aren\u2019t absolutely necessary. \u201cThe more often you need to check a bag, the more often you need to hide away the straps,\u201d Levy said. \u201cBut if the straps are tough enough, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n- Accessory pocket layout and design: Some people love an accessory pocket that has a specific space for everything; others find that feature constricting and unadaptable. We prioritized bags with simple designs that guided our packing without constraining us.\n- Style: This element is purely subjective. We preferred bags that had a minimalist exterior style, but not all of our picks will please everyone. Most of the people we spoke with, however, preferred not to stick out like a tourist wearing a large, colorful backpack, if they could avoid it.\nDuring testing, we flew across the country with these bags, took weekend trips to nearby cities, lived out of them on extended trips, and tried them locally in our daily routines. We also packed and unpacked each bag, using a standardized set of weeklong travel necessities and accessories, to see how well the internal organizational features (or lack thereof) aided or impeded efficient packing.\nThe competition\nThis is not a comprehensive list of all of the carry-on travel backpacks we have tested. We have removed any models that have been discontinued or that no longer meet our criteria.\nAway Outdoor Convertible Backpack 45L: This is a resoundingly average bag for the price. Although it\u2019s made from excellent materials, the bag is let down by its overall design, which lacks any kind of structure or attention to comfort. You have better options.\nCabin Max Metz; This bag is intriguing for the price: inexpensive and no frills. Any bag costing so little should almost be considered disposable. That said, if you need a simple bag that costs less than a seat upgrade, this model might be the way to go.\nGoRuck GR3: For certain people, this bag is almost worth the steep cost. It\u2019s strong and simple and covered by an iron-clad repair guarantee. The removable hip belt is comfortable to wear, and it\u2019s good at displacing the weight of this 45-liter backpack (also available in a 35-liter model). This is a decent bag. While testing it, however, we weren\u2019t thrilled with the internal Velcro lining for compatible Velcro packing cubes. Velcro isn\u2019t great: It wears out, it\u2019s difficult to keep clean, and it clings to dirt. That might seem like a small thing, but for the price, this bag should feel perfect. That said, I\u2019ve had a smaller GoRuck backpack for over a decade now and it only gets better with age.\nMinaal Carry-On 2.0: This was designed to be a backpack for businesspeople. But if you\u2019re carrying it for business, you\u2019re probably wearing at least a blazer, so you wouldn\u2019t use a backpack in any case. If you\u2019re a business traveler who falls more on the casual end of the business-casual spectrum, and you\u2019re not on a budget, this is a well-thought-out pack. But our picks are more versatile for world travel, and they come at a better price. Minaal has since introduced a 3.0 version of this bag; our thoughts about it remain the same.\nOsprey Sojourn Porter 46L: A slightly larger sibling of the Farpoint and Fairview packs, the Sojourn Porter is about 2 inches longer, and it pushes right up to most airline limits. If you don\u2019t mind possibly having to check your bag at the last minute, this model is a good alternative to the Farpoint pack.\nMatador GlobeRider45 Travel Backpack: Matador consistently makes interesting high-end gear and this is no exception. We appreciate the use of recycled materials, the stowable straps, and relatively easy organization. However it\u2019s more expensive than all our other picks except for the Tortuga and lacks the admin organization that makes the Tortuga such a good one-bag pick for so-called \u201cdigital nomads.\u201d The easiest fix would be to make the oddly narrow laptop sleeve wider and provide more digital organization.\nWhat to look forward to\nSalkan is a newer brand dedicated to making true \u201cbuy-it-for-life\u201d gear with a sturdy warranty and repair program, such as The Carry-On 35L. It\u2019s rare to see bags with these kinds of classic looks; we plan to test one soon.\nThis article was edited by Ria Misra and Christine Ryan.\nSources\nChase Reeves, Matterful.co, phone interview, October 10, 2018\nAddison Ryan, moderator, r/onebag, email interview, September 8, 2018\nLindsay Lorraine Calder\u00f3n, moderator, r/heronebag, phone interview, September 28, 2018\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "How Wirecutter Makes Money\nYou may have noticed a line that appears at the top of every Wirecutter article. \u201cWe independently review everything we recommend,\u201d it says. \u201cWhen you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\u201d\nBut what, exactly, does that mean?\nIt means we make recommendations of products solely based on our evaluation of their quality. Our journalists make every editorial decision\u2014such as which products to test and which products to recommend\u2014totally independent of business considerations.\nWirecutter does often make money when you buy our picks. But any discussions about business, partnerships, licensing, or affiliate revenue are handled after we\u2019ve already made our picks. Such revenue decisions are the responsibility of Wirecutter\u2019s commerce team, which is an arm that is separate from our newsroom, and those decisions have zero effect on our editorial choices.\nHere\u2019s how it all works.\nAffiliate marketing 101\nTo understand Wirecutter\u2019s business, let\u2019s start with affiliate marketing.\nAn online retailer such as Amazon or a direct-order company such as the mattress maker Leesa strikes deals with affiliate partners. These partners might be small blogs, Instagram influencers, coupon websites, or a rigorous product-recommendation site like Wirecutter.\nThose affiliate partners often (though not always) earn a certain amount of money, typically a percentage of the product\u2019s price, when someone buys a product through the links on the partners\u2019 pages. This practice is known as affiliate marketing.\nFTC guidelines for affiliate marketers stipulate that such commission-based relationships must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed, which is why Wirecutter and other websites have such language on every page where an affiliate link appears.\nWhat makes Wirecutter different from other product-recommendation sites\nAt Wirecutter, a strict wall exists between our editorial and commerce departments.\nWhen we say that writers and editors \u201cindependently review everything we recommend,\u201d we\u2019re referring to how our journalists embark on Wirecutter\u2019s exhaustive testing process (you can read more about the multitudinous steps in our breakdown of a Wirecutter guide) without consideration for how our recommendations will make Wirecutter money. Their only job is to decide what is the best.\nThis is not how things work at many other product-recommendation websites, where writers and editors are much more involved in the business outcomes and implications of the products they select. Their recommendations are often impacted by business considerations.\nOurs are not.\nWhen Wirecutter makes money\nWirecutter\u2019s commerce operation comes in after our writers and editors have made all their picks.\nAt this point\u2014and only at this point\u2014our business-side colleagues determine where to send links for products (Home Depot or Amazon? REI or Backcountry?) based on a puzzle of price, a website\u2019s ease of use, shipping costs, customer service, and, yes, affiliate rates.\n\u201cThe reader experience doesn\u2019t end when you leave our site,\u201d says Wirecutter\u2019s executive director of commerce, Leilani Han. \u201cWhen we\u2019re choosing the retailers we\u2019re sending our readers to, we\u2019re sending them somewhere we would personally want to shop. That\u2019s taking into consideration things like the ease of returns or shipping costs, or even how easy it is to add something to your cart. The reader experience comes first\u2014before we consider the monetization aspect.\u201d\nThe commerce team also accounts for the effect that being featured on Wirecutter has on a retailer: The site has to have enough inventory to fulfill a potential influx of orders.\n\u201cA Wirecutter pick is only as good as your ability to purchase it,\u201d Leilani says. \u201cIf you go to a site, and the product isn\u2019t in stock, then what are you supposed to do? We do a lot of work to find retailers that have the infrastructure and inventory to support a good experience for our readers.\u201d\nEnsuring the quality of a reader\u2019s experience is the primary goal. In some cases, Wirecutter makes no money at all on a pick, simply because the only high-quality retailer that sells the item doesn\u2019t run an affiliate program.\nWe won\u2019t ever send our readers to a site that\u2019s frustrating to use or a retailer with excessive shipping costs simply to make money at the expense of our relationship to our readers.\nYou can trust us\nWe can say definitively that no pick on Wirecutter has ever been sponsored by a manufacturer or retailer or anyone else. No product has ever been named as a pick because it would make our business more money.\nFor Wirecutter\u2019s journalists, the revenue of our picks is thankfully not our responsibility\u2014in accordance with Wirecutter policy, we\u2019re not made aware of those relationships at all. If we say positive things about a product, it\u2019s because we have tested it and found it recommendation-worthy.\nNow, Wirecutter often makes money when it recommends a product, but we believe that our business\u2019s interests align with those of the reader. If you\u2019re unhappy with a product that you bought based on our recommendation, and you return it, Wirecutter doesn\u2019t make any money. You would also be likely to stop taking our advice in the future.\nBut if we independently make great recommendations, and you\u2019re happy with your purchases, we\u2019ve succeeded in our journalistic mission, and our business makes money to further that mission.\nThere\u2019s no incentive for us to give a bad recommendation, especially since the real cost of doing so is not just a few dollars\u2014it\u2019s the loss of your trust. The confidence that our readers have in our expertise is what has made Wirecutter a reliable friend (and yes, business) since 2011.\nThis article was edited by Amber Angelle and Ben Frumin.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

We hope you\u2019re able to make every night a smore\u2019s night! \u2013 TIKI Brand\nAnswered by: TIKIBrand\nDate published: 2023-07-07\nThe flames are too high for comfort for me in my tree lined patio in my desert climate. It was a raging fire using the pellet bag with at least 4 feet of flame outside the can. Can I open up the bag and use less pellets to reduce flame height ?\nAsked by: Californian\nThanks for the question! The Wood Packs are designed for one-time use and should not be opened and split up. The Fire Pit should not be used closer than 15 feet to any walls, structures, or buildings, and should not be placed on any combustible surface. Flames may reach a height of 4 feet above the top of the Fire Pit. Further, the Fire Pit should not be used under a patio roof, any low-hanging branches, trellises, or overhangs of any kind, including covered porches. We hope this helps. -TIKI Brand\nAnswered by: TIKIBrand\nDate published: 2023-10-16\nIs there a shelf life for the packs? I live in LA and don\u2019t use my pit as often.

      "text": "The Best Camping Stove\nA camp stove doesn\u2019t have to be complicated to be great.\nIt should cook food and boil water quickly and be rugged enough to withstand travel in the back of a car. And it should not require a burdensome amount of fuel.\nAfter researching 26 camp stoves, testing 13, and dissecting three of them\u2014down to the welded copper tubing and soldered burner plates\u2014we discovered that the Coleman Classic Propane Camping Stove is, in fact, uncomplicated yet great.\nThe Coleman Classic Propane Camping Stove\u2019s most important feature is its reliability\u2014despite getting tossed in and out of our cars repeatedly, it continued to work perfectly.\nWe also appreciated its versatility. This Coleman model boiled water faster than any other stove we tested under $150, yet when we turned it down low, it was gentle enough to griddle golden-brown pancakes.\nOn a single, 16-ounce tank of propane, this stove can cook with both burners on high for roughly an hour, and it has the barest minimum of parts, so it\u2019s easy to maintain.\nThis Coleman model does not have a piezo igniter (the little red button on a lot of stoves\u2014including our runner-up and upgrade picks\u2014that lights the gas), so you\u2019ll need to bring a lighter. To us, that\u2019s just one fewer thing to break (and if you\u2019re paying less than $150 for a stove, the piezo igniters almost always break).\nIf our top pick is out of stock, or you\u2019d like more cooking control (and a stove with potentially a touch more durability), the Coleman Cascade 222 2-Burner Camping Stove represents the next step up from the Coleman Classic.\nWhat separates it from the Classic (and adds to the price tag) is more control throughout the range of cooking temperatures. It boils water a bit faster than the Classic, yet it still has a gentle flame that lets you cook food more delicately than on the Classic (for instance, if you prefer your eggs soft scrambled).\nIt also includes a piezo ignition, which is fine as long as you don\u2019t expect that component to last forever (none of them do). The Cascade case is easier to carry, thanks to its included handle.\nThe heavy-gauge, all-aluminum Camp Chef Mountaineer Aluminum Stove is built like the tough, classic camping equipment you hear salty old-timers or vintage-equipment nerds talk about. It\u2019s more expensive than either of our Coleman picks, but if you\u2019re comfortable with the jump in cost, the Mountaineer may be worth the investment.\nWeighing just over 16 pounds, this stove is 4 pounds heavier than the Coleman Classic. But with its large, three-way windscreen, a hookup for a big (5 to 20 pounds) propane bottle, and a 40,000 Btu output (double that of the Coleman Classic), the Mountaineer lets you do more in the way of high-heat cooking than our other picks. For instance, you can sear a steak at a higher heat than on our other picks and get a darker char more quickly, so you can cook more food in the same amount of time.\nManaging the controls does require finesse\u2014with a stove this powerful, it\u2019s easier to burn your food than to keep the heat low. This stove is great for very committed car-camping gourmets, but for most campers, the cost and durability are overkill.\nYou probably won\u2019t be hauling the Original FireDisc 380 Portable Propane Cooker too far from your car (in total this stove weighs 55 pounds, so it\u2019s the heaviest model we tested). Yet this stove break downs into three fairly easy-to-carry components: two supporting trusses and one large pan.\nIt has the simplicity and strength of something you\u2019d expect to last a lifetime (with the proper care). In other words, the FireDisc 380 should last a lot longer than its five-year limited warranty. It has a single-pan design (think of a wok or a paella pan, though the FireDisc stove is most closely related to a Mexican discada), so you can do away with the usual pots, pans, and sear plates.\nCooking on the FireDisc 380 is akin to using a large griddle plate: You can make a single large-pot meal, like a stew or fry-up, or set up zones for different foods, as you might when preparing fajitas. Either way, to some extent you\u2019re inevitably cooking everything together, and the heat controls are limited.\nThe research\n- Why you should trust me\n- Who should buy this\n- How we picked and tested\n- Top pick: Coleman Classic Propane Camping Stove\n- Runner-up: Coleman Cascade 222 2-Burner Camping Stove\n- Upgrade pick: Camp Chef Mountaineer Aluminum Stove\n- Best one-pan alternative for large groups: Original FireDisc 380 Portable Propane Cooker\n- Other camp stoves worth considering\n- Sustainability: The problem with disposable propane bottles (and a few useful solutions)\n- What to look forward to\n- The competition\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019ve covered gear as a journalist at Wirecutter since 2014. For a while I lived in a makeshift community in Hawaii, cooking on propane stoves just like these ones for nine months.\nFor this guide:\n- I interviewed Matthew McKean\u2014a camp chef and expedition leader for Canadian wilderness lodge Outpost Co. and the rugged Keewaydin canoe camp in Ontario\u2014about his experiences cooking for large parties in all manner of outdoor situations.\n- I took apart all our picks and contenders several times to compare components and build quality.\n- I have cooked on all our picks for several years during camping trips, comparing how easy they are to use and, of course, how good the food tastes!\n- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I\u2019m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nWho should buy this\nThese stoves are not for backpacking expeditions, but if you use a car or truck as the base for your overnight trips, two-burner camp stoves are fundamental to a successful car-camping adventure. They\u2019re essential for trips to national parks or local recreation areas, where cooking on an open fire or barbecue pit may not be allowed, especially during wildfire season.\nAnd we\u2019ve never heard the maxim that a tired and hungry family is a happy family. This is why two-burner camp stoves are the workhorse of any group camping trip, since they can quickly cook meals for four or more people. Simple to load and easy to carry, they\u2019re built to be packed in the trunk beneath a pile of camping gear, pulled out after a too-long drive, and set up on a table or the ground to cook dinner without complaint. The good ones will do that. The best ones will do it for a lifetime.\nHow we picked and tested\nYou can find a few reputable (as well as less-than-reputable) sites that offer reviews of camp stoves. We began with GearLab, Camping Stove Cookout, HiConsumption, and BestProducts.com. We determined the top 16 contenders from these reviews and from researching Amazon best-sellers, after which we narrowed the group down to eight models to test.\nIn 2021, we added two more of the most promising models to our cooking-test lineup. In 2022, we tested the Cascade series of Coleman stoves. Throughout any testing, here\u2019s what we look for in this category:\n- Consistent high-heat output: We brought these stoves to the beach to see how they would work in sustained winds. We also brought them to a public park to cook up a full breakfast of pancakes, bacon, eggs, and coffee. Initially, to get a baseline for each stove\u2019s general performance, we focused on how quickly it could boil water (similar to the process of many of the sites listed above).\n- Precision control: What was more illuminating was a test we conducted to determine each stove\u2019s ability to maintain a small and steady flame\u2014which you\u2019re likely to want if you value the precision necessary for certain recipes, like soft scrambled eggs or pan-fried fish. We tried a recipe that required the lowest stove temperatures to cook it properly. To perform this test, we consulted with Lesley Stockton, senior staff writer and guru on Wirecutter\u2019s kitchen team, who came up with an order for soft scrambled eggs from Kitchn. Ideally, on a decent home stove, these eggs should cook for 10 to 15 minutes on the lowest possible heat.\n- Durability, durability, durability: In the end, what we learned was that the boiling-water test isn\u2019t nearly as important as overall stove build quality. Most of the stoves we tested could boil 6 cups of water, uncovered, within a few minutes of one another. That indeed offers a point of comparison. Yet what does it matter that your stove can boil water a minute faster if, when you open it up, one of the burners has fallen apart or the propane line won\u2019t connect to your gas tank?\nTop pick: Coleman Classic Propane Camping Stove\nAfter five years of testing, the Coleman Classic Propane Camping Stove remains the best all-around camping stove for most people.\nSimple is best. The Coleman Classic stove\u2019s greatest strength is its simplicity. Unlike many of the others we tested, this stove has no extra parts or elaborate accessories to break or otherwise complicate what should be an uncomplicated item. The Classic tears down into roughly six pieces: a cooking grate, two removable burners, a gas connection, the case (which includes two wind guards), and the internal gas lines. That\u2019s it. What it doesn\u2019t have is an ignition switch. But with a camp stove, that\u2019s just one more thing to break anyway.\nIt boils water just as quickly as more expensive stoves. Uncovered, the Coleman Classic boiled water in 5 minutes on the right burner and 6 minutes 30 seconds on the left burner. Though this result was fairly typical (most of the stoves we tested boiled water within 5.5 minutes to 7 minutes), it stood out compared with the time it took some much-pricier models to do the same task; the now-discontinued Camp Chef Rainier, for instance, took a ridiculous 20 minutes to get water anywhere near boiling.\nThe cooking controls were delicate enough that we could crank up the Coleman Classic to boil water and fry bacon or turn it down to poach an egg and create golden-edged pancakes. This stove has 10,000 Btu (British thermal units) of heat emanating from each burner on high, so you should be able to cook almost anything you can imagine\u2014from burgers to a creamy chicken braise to a vegetable stir-fry. And your family and friends will be surprised by the quality.\nBut it can maintain decent low cooking temperatures for a camp stove. In our test, the Coleman Classic cooked soft scrambled eggs from raw in 4 minutes. This result was well below the 10 to 15 minutes that the recipe calls for, yet it was still 2 minutes 30 seconds slower than it took the pricier (and now discontinued) Coleman FyreCadet. Also, even though eggs cooked in the Classic weren\u2019t as ethereal as eggs cooked at home for over 10 minutes would be, they were still wonderfully soft.\nThe flexible design allows for a few different layouts. A neat feature of this stove is that the lid can lie completely flat, which creates more stovetop room (unlike on some others we\u2019ve tested) for larger pots and pans. And although this arrangement removes wind protection, it lends a little more flexibility when you\u2019re cooking for a crowd in a sheltered spot.\nThe Classic gives you plenty of cook time. On average the Classic should last about an hour on a single, 16-ounce tank of propane with both burners on maximum. Using more-typical cooking temps, we found that a single tank lasted us closer to an hour and a half, which is standard for all of the two-burner stoves we tested. Remember, however: The Classic does not come with an ignition switch, so be sure to pack your matches or lighter.\nColeman covers this stove with a three-year limited warranty.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n- You might need some DIY skills. The pressed metal of the cooktop (held in place by two thin slip rings clasped around the burner heads) has a tendency to move out of alignment, catching against the rolled inner lip of the lid when closed. At one point I had to use the handle of a spoon to pry open the case again. Other people also came across this issue. You could fix the problem using a Dremel tool and a grinder, if you have one.\n- Some people have reported that the dials can feel sticky or unresponsive. One owner posted a solution that involves about 10 minutes of labor and the application of silicone lube. Though our test unit\u2019s dials didn\u2019t feel unresponsive, we followed the instructions, and we were pleased with the result of more-sensitive controls.\nRunner-up: Coleman Cascade 222 2-Burner Camping Stove\nIf you can\u2019t find our top pick, or you want the option of serving your scrambled eggs extra-soft or bringing your veggies down to a much slower simmer, the Coleman Cascade 222 2-Burner Camping Stove will serve you well.\nIt\u2019s robust for a stove this size. The metal body of the Cascade feels a touch sturdier than that of the Classic. The Cascade weighs about 3 pounds more than the Classic, which may account for some of that feeling of sturdiness. To help you manage the extra weight, Coleman added a decent handle to the body of the Cascade.\nWhile cooking, the Cascade can hold a 12-inch pan and a 10-inch pan side by side, like the Classic. With 22,000 Btu (11,000 Btu from each burner), it produces a touch more heat than our top pick\u2014not all that much for a stove that costs twice the price. If that\u2019s all the Cascade could do, we probably wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\nIt allows for plenty of temperature control. Where the Cascade shines is in the finer control it allows throughout the range of temperatures. Most camping stoves, including our top pick, have a tendency to jump temperatures, from very low to very high, with barely a touch of the hand. In our testing, thanks to the Cascade\u2019s finer control, we could gently cook soft scrambled eggs, fry an egg fully without burning the bottom, or saut\u00e9 vegetables without having to move the pan every 30 seconds.\nIt comes with a piezo electric ignition. It\u2019s a nice addition\u2014especially if you tend to forget things like matches\u2014but it\u2019s not something we give much weight to because this component tends to break over time.\nAs with all Coleman stoves, the Cascade line is protected by a three-year limited warranty.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n- You might still need those DIY skills. The biggest flaw of the Cascade is similar to that of the Coleman Classic: The pressed metal of the Cascade\u2019s cooktop can sometimes shift out of alignment, catching against the rolled inner lip of the lid when the entire stove is closed. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, though, and it might be somewhat inevitable for a stove that\u2019s this simply built.\nUpgrade pick: Camp Chef Mountaineer Aluminum Stove\nThe Camp Chef Mountaineer Aluminum Stove is not for everyone. In both price and durability, this stove is overkill for all but the most committed outdoor gourmets. However, after testing about a dozen camping stoves over several years, we\u2019ve found that the Mountaineer is the best-made and most durable classic two-burner camping stove we\u2019ve come across.\nThe Mountaineer is made for a chef. If you love to create kitchen-quality or \u201cgourmet\u201d food from scratch in rustic conditions, this is the stove for you. It\u2019s basically a beefed-up version of our top pick. The Mountaineer is larger (at 25.25 by 13.75 by 5.25 inches, it dwarfs our top pick). It\u2019s heavier (17 pounds, versus the Coleman Classic\u2019s 11 pounds). And it offers way more heat output (40,000 Btu, versus the Coleman Classic\u2019s 20,000 Btu).\nIt\u2019s very fun to cook on and even easier to clean. Cooking with the Mountaineer is a blast. Compared with any camp stove I\u2019ve ever used, this one feels far more like cooking in a kitchen or with a traditional gas range. From seared ribeyes and soft eggs to delicate fish-frys and blistered vegetables\u2014if you can cook it on a burner, the Mountaineer can keep up. And after all that, the Mountaineer, with its simple, all-metal design, is especially easy to clean: You just need some soap and a hose.\nThe Camp Chef Mountaineer comes with a limited lifetime warranty for the original owner\u2014registration is recommended.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n- Something with this much cooking power will consume propane at a prodigious clip. As a result, Camp Chef assumes you\u2019re not running 1-pound propane bottles with a stove like this, and it defaults to a hose for a larger propane tank.\n- The gas-line connection is located on the front of the stove, instead of on the side (as with the Coleman Classic). Though this setup may be useful in certain tight situations, in most camp settings it\u2019s more of a nuisance. Even tucked away, the hose is still too close to the controls of the right burner.\n- Fresh out of the box, this stove\u2019s thick-gauge aluminum is sharp. Ideally, the edges would be smoothed and the burrs removed at the factory. So if you have a few tools, you might want to sand down or grind out the sharp corners.\n- The Mountaineer does have an additional-leg kit, but we didn\u2019t find the pieces helpful. (The legs were too short for our needs, and they felt loose when attached.) It\u2019s better if you can set this stove on a table or some kind of camp stand.\nBest one-pan alternative for large groups: Original FireDisc 380 Portable Propane Cooker\nThe Original FireDisc 380 Portable Propane Cooker is ideal for cooking large, one-pan meals for big groups of campers.\nIt has a wonderfully simple design. The cooker consists of a heavy carbon-steel disc, measuring 22 inches across, that sits on a set of two interlocked steel legs. Unlike our other picks (all of which are classic two-burner stoves), the FireDisc 380 has a single gas burner with the pan included. That burner can run on a 1-pound canister or, with an adapter hose, a 20-pound tank. Depending on what\u2019s cooking, most people are likely to prefer a tank over a smaller canister to ensure that they don\u2019t run out of gas. The single burner creates a high-heat zone in the center of the disc\u2014the idea is that you control the temperature by moving the food around.\nYou can quickly and easily cook for a crowd. Temperature control in this situation is more about cooking capacity than about cooking control. In this case, higher gas output means you get a larger searing center for a bigger meal. With recipes such as tacos de discada, this kind of heat control works well: As each element\u2014fatty meats, vegetables, sauce\u2014of the meal cooks, you move it to the outer rim to simmer, and then you blend everything together at the end. Because of this stove\u2019s single large cooking surface, you can cook for far more people far more quickly than you normally could with a smaller, cast-iron pan. The high walls of the FireDisc stove enable you to more easily make stews, fry-ups, and casseroles than you can with any piece of camp-cooking equipment we\u2019ve ever tested.\nHowever, it\u2019s built to last. The FireDisc 380 comes with a five-year warranty, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that the cooking disc would fail before that warranty ran out. With the proper care (as well as decent storage when it\u2019s not in use), a piece of equipment like this should last a lifetime.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n- We\u2019d prefer to see better heat controls. The supplied heat control on the gas valve is about as sensitive as a rocket-launch sequence: off, on, and to the moon.\n- The FireDisc 380 isn\u2019t well suited to cooking individual items, such as burgers or hot dogs. The center is way too hot for searing a burger, and rotating a few of them around the outer edges of the disc while trying to get a uniform char is tricky.\n- Due to the solid, heavy steel and sturdy design, this stove is exceptionally hefty. The short model is 55 pounds in total, so it is cumbersome to haul around, and you likely won\u2019t want to carry this far from your car or campground.\nOther camp stoves worth considering\nIf you\u2019re trying to save weight (and wind won\u2019t be a problem): Consider the Jetboil Genesis 2-Burner Stove, which is lightweight and compact. Because of its folding design and its lack of a proper windscreen, it\u2019s too specialized for this guide, but that doesn\u2019t make it a bad stove. Quite the opposite. The Genesis is probably too bulky for long hiking trips. Yet this stove has excellent qualities (if you manage to keep it out of the wind), so it\u2019s a good, if expensive, pick for specific situations: I imagine a space-saving car-camping trip or a canoe journey.\nIf money is no object but packing space is: The GSI Pinnacle Pro Stove is by far the slimmest stove we tested (1.4 inches thick when closed) and superbly built. It boiled water just about as quickly as our top pick, and it slow-cooked eggs with the same precision. However, it costs many times the price, so we\u2019re comfortable being nitpicky about flaws: Due the stove\u2019s slimness, there\u2019s less heat dissipation, the bottom becomes extremely hot during cooking, and the body of the stove doesn\u2019t lock when it\u2019s closed for transport.\nIf the Coleman Classic and Cascade are both sold out: Look for the Coleman Triton 2-Burner Propane Gas Camping Stove, which is practically the same as our top pick but in a more modern case. The same strengths and flaws apply. If our Coleman picks aren\u2019t available, this stove is a viable replacement (though it does cost more than the Classic).\nSustainability: The problem with disposable propane bottles (and a few useful solutions)\nAlthough cooking on a camp stove is usually more fuel-efficient than cooking over a campfire, here\u2019s the awful truth of the standard 1-pound propane tanks that power these stoves: They\u2019re built to be disposable and are especially difficult to dispose of properly. (This is one reason California recently passed a law banning such tanks; the ban takes effect at the start of 2028.)\nEmpty propane tanks are considered hazardous waste in most of the United States, so they are difficult to recycle. (They could explode if they\u2019re not completely empty.) You could take them to a hazardous-waste facility, but such places are not always easy to find (see below for help). As a result, most tanks end up stockpiled in people\u2019s garages, abandoned near campsites, or dumped as trash.\nAlthough it\u2019s legal to buy disposable-bottle refill kits, it remains illegal to commercially transport one-use bottles after they have been refilled. Improper filling can be dangerous and lead to injury. On its bottles, Coleman expressly recommends not doing this\u2014though some people still do.\nThere are some safer solutions, however.\nBernzomatic offers a good resource to help you track down your local solid-waste disposal authority and take the proper measures before disposing of your tanks. Contact your local government or recycling company to find out if they handle household hazardous waste (HHW) and whether they offer any special collection days when you can deposit the canisters. (In addition, a handful of national parks collect fuel canisters for recycling; the National Park Service recommends checking with the visitor center or your campground hosts.)\nWhen disposing of your bottle, be sure that you\u2019ve completely emptied the tank of all of its remaining gas. Attaching a tank to an open valve on your stove will burn off the final fractions of fuel, but be aware that the last bits of fuel and vapor leave the canister at a remarkably slow rate. Always keep the valve open\u2014even after the flames have sputtered\u2014for about a minute or two to ensure that any final vapor has escaped.\nIf you have a space where you can safely store a propane tank, you could consider refillable alternatives. If you\u2019re car camping and don\u2019t mind the extra weight, 5-pound propane tanks and adapter hoses are available; they can hook up directly to these stoves. Not only are the 5-pound tanks refillable, but over time it\u2019s cheaper to refill a reservoir with gas than to buy new disposable bottles.\nSetting up a stove this way couldn\u2019t be easier: You attach one end of the adapter hose to the propane tank and hook the other end to the fuel inlet on your stove. Once that\u2019s set, you open the cylinder valve on the tank and then ignite your stove the same way you would if you were using a disposable tank.\nIf you can\u2019t manage the extra weight, consider purchasing a refillable 1-pound bottle and kit from Flame King (pictured below). As with the 5-pound option, the savings are significant when you consider how much cheaper it is to refill a propane tank with gas directly than it is to buy a disposable bottle. Other companies, such as Ignik, Little Kamper, and Fuel Keg, also offer refillable bottles in varying sizes.\nWhat to look forward to\nAs we continue to explore other alternative cooker designs (including, if they become available, those using more environmentally friendly fuels and technologies), we\u2019d like to look more closely at portable paella cookers and discadas. We would also like to examine single-burner butane designs\u2014similar to what you\u2019d find at some Korean restaurants\u2014such as the Kovea Cube and the Iwatani 35FW Butane Stove.\nThe competition\nThe Stansport Boulder Series 2-Burner Propane Stove disappointed us with its overall build quality and terrible low-temperature control. Over the years we\u2019ve had wildly variable results from similar Stansport stoves. Another, similar Stansport model, the Regulated Propane Stove, was once an upgrade pick but has been plagued by stock issues.\nConsidering its jaw-dropping price (currently $510), the Snow Peak Double Burner Stove should be the best camping stove you can buy\u2014or at least the most versatile. Yet it\u2019s not. Although it\u2019s constructed from excellent materials, this stove misses the mark. It requires two separate IsoPro bottles to work; running it from a single, larger tank\u2014even with conversion valves\u2014is difficult. On top of that, during our tests the legs and wind screen both felt unpleasantly insecure when we were cooking on the stove.\nThe TemboTusk Adjustable Leg Skottle Grill Kit has the lightweight, cobbled-together charm of good adventure gear. However, given this stove\u2019s price, we\u2019ve concluded that most people are better served by our discada-style pick, the FireDisc 380. The TemboTusk has three legs, versus the four on the FireDisc, and a smaller overall cooking area, so it seems unstable and too limited for family cooking.\nWe also tested and dismissed Camp Chef, GSI, Primus, and Stansport stoves that have since been discontinued.\nThis article was edited by Ria Misra and Christine Ryan.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT"

The key to a smokeless system is creating more airflow and burning a hotter fire. So, what does smokeless mean exactly?\nStep 1 - Patented Airflow\nThe X Airflow raised air vent design on the bottom of the fire pit enables oxygen to feed the fire even after significant ash build up.\nStep 2 - Double Wall Technology\nAir enters a cavity at the bottom into the double wall while the fire heats the walls. Hot air rises through the gap between the two walls as the fire burns.\nStep 3 - Combustion\nThe hot air then exits the double wall through holes around the rim. This pressurized, heated oxygen mixes with the smoke and causes secondary combustion or reburn.\nA better fireside awaits\nLive-fire cooking\nFeed your friends, feed your soul, feed your fire.\nExperience the difference of fireside innovation from Breeo.\nFireside Furniture\nBUILT TO LAST\nOur Story\n10 years ago, the first ever smokeless fire pit was born into a company that would later become Breeo, LLC.

      "text": "The Best Food Thermos\nThere\u2019s a golden rule of the communal microwave: Thou shalt not heat up gross or smelly stuff in it.\nSadly, that rule is not always followed.\nIf you\u2019re trying to avoid your lunch tasting like someone else\u2019s salmon leftovers, consider packing your meal in a food thermos that will keep it warm.\nOf course, food thermoses have uses outside of avoiding the ruination of a perfectly good lunch.\nWhether you\u2019re packing chili for lunch or oatmeal to eat after your morning commute, a good food thermos will keep hot foods at safe temperatures for hours, and they won\u2019t leak into your bag.\nUnfortunately, they\u2019re not great at keeping cold foods at safe cold temperatures.\nAfter comparing 22 food thermoses and testing 10, we\u2019re confident that the Zojirushi Stainless Steel Food Jar is the best. It has excellent heat retention, is durable and easy to clean, and comes in three sizes ranging from 12 to 25 ounces.\nWe also recommend the 10-ounce Thermos Funtainer Food Jar for packing kids\u2019 lunches or for people who prefer smaller portions.\nThe Zojirushi Stainless Steel Food Jar kept our tomato soup above a food-safe temperature (140 \u00b0F) for a full six hours. Liquids stayed warm for even longer than the six hours the brand claims.\nIt easily fits in one hand, and it emerged from our drop test with no dents. And it doesn\u2019t leak.\nThe four-piece lid comes apart for easier cleaning, though keeping all of the parts together is cumbersome.\nThe Zojirushi\u2019s heat retention is covered by a five-year limited warranty.\nThe Thermos Funtainer kept food hot, didn\u2019t break when dropped, and didn\u2019t leak. And it was easy to clean.\nWith its 10-ounce size, bright colors, and lower price tag, this thermos is particularly good for kids.\nIt fits into small lunchboxes, though it held our soup at a food-safe temperature for only four hours (versus the Zojirushi\u2019s six-hour run).\nThermos also offers a 30-day warranty for defective products.\nHow we picked and tested\nIt\u2019s been years since Wirecutter\u2019s Anna Perling rigorously and comprehensively tested food thermoses. But this is not a category with a lot of technological innovation. We\u2019re confident that our picks are still great.\nWe considered models designed for kids as well as for adults. We preferred thermoses that come in multiple sizes and colors. And we tested smaller-size options (ranging from 10 to 13.5 ounces, with a few 16- and 17-ounce sizes) when possible, since we wanted a thermos that was easily portable and would fit into our picks for the best lunch box.\nA great thermos should keep foods at a food-safe temperature\u2014below 40 \u00b0F for cold foods and above 140 \u00b0F for hot foods\u2014for long periods of time. In our tests, we considered how long thermoses kept soup and plain bow-tie pasta warm, as well as how long they kept milk and tuna salad cold.\nThey shouldn\u2019t leak or otherwise compromise their contents in transport. Thermoses are meant to hold liquidy foods like soups or stews. They shouldn\u2019t leak. Because accidents happen, they also shouldn\u2019t break or dent significantly when dropped.\nThey need to be easy to clean. Most companies recommend hand-washing thermoses to preserve their vacuum insulation, but the lids and jars should be intuitive to take apart and clean.\nHow we tested\nTo test our 10 food thermoses, we heated tomato soup to a boil and added it to the thermoses, checking the temperature over six hours in two-hour increments.\nWe did the same with pasta. Our pasta tests, however, weren\u2019t conclusive\u2014it took us longer to fill the thermoses with wider bow-tie noodles after straining them than it did to ladle in boiling-hot soup, and we think the pasta likely cooled during the process.\nWe also tested the thermoses with cold foods, filling them first with milk and then with 4 ounces of tuna salad, both at 40 \u00b0F.\nThen, because both milk and tuna rose above food-safe temperatures in all of the thermoses after just two hours, we repeated the tuna test after pre-chilling the thermoses with 40 \u00b0F ice water.\nA few brands, like Thermos and Zojirushi, recommend pre-chilling thermoses, but we originally skipped this step because it\u2019s annoying for thermos users.\nBut even after we pre-chilled the thermoses, after two hours none of them kept tuna within the USDA\u2019s safe temperature guidelines.\nAfter filling the thermoses with soup, we shook them in a backpack and held them upside down to check for leaks.\nWe also dropped thermoses from 4 feet onto pavement to see if they were damaged after a fall.\nTo see how easy models were to clean, we took them apart and hand-washed them.\nOur pick: Zojirushi Stainless Steel Food Jar\nIn our tests, the Zojirushi Stainless Steel Food Jar was one of the best at keeping soup hot. It proved durable, didn\u2019t leak, and was quite easy to clean.\nIt keeps its contents hot (or cold). The 12-ounce thermos kept tomato soup above a food -afe temperature (140 \u00b0F) for a full six hours in our tests, dropping from 193 \u00b0F to 144 \u00b0F.\nThe only thermoses that did better were the 17-ounce Stanley Classic (larger volumes of liquid take longer to cool) and the Black and Blum Food Flask (which has an awkward strap around it).\nWe\u2019ve used the Zojirushi to transport morning green smoothies, chili, soup, and oatmeal. It reliably keeps foods at nice temperatures.\nTo keep foods hotter for longer, we recommend preheating the thermos.\nIt\u2019s durable and doesn\u2019t leak. When shaken or held upside down in our tests, the Zojirushi didn\u2019t leak (though none of the thermoses we tested did). The Zojirushi is also durable, surviving our drop test unscathed. Other metal jars dented upon impact.\nWe\u2019ve also seen it survive trips through the dishwasher without a ding, even though Zojirushi recommends hand-washing the thermos.\nAnd it\u2019s easy to take apart and clean. The Zojirushi has a four-piece lid that comes apart, which allows you to deep-clean all of its crevices. We liked it better than the single-piece lids on most of the other thermoses we tested, which have hard-to-reach threads that look like they would trap gunk.\nThe Zojirushi also comes in a range of sizes, including 11.8-, 16.9-, and 25-ounce jars, and an array of colors, including pink, aqua blue, dark brown, cream, and stainless steel.\nPlus, the heat retention of the Zojirushi is covered by a five-year limited warranty.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nIt\u2019s not as great at keeping cold food cold. After just two hours, cold milk in the Zojirushi rose to 46 \u00b0F; after six hours, it was 52 \u00b0F. Tuna rose to 49 \u00b0F after two hours; after six hours, it was 63 \u00b0F.\nNone of the other thermoses we tested, however, did any better, even after we pre-chilled them with ice water (Zojirushi recommends filling the thermos with cold water for one to two minutes before filling it with food).\nPacking the thermos in a bag or lunch box with ice packs can help foods stay cold, but ultimately we found that these thermoses are best for retaining heat.\nPlain pasta also cooled more quickly in the Zojirushi, dropping from 178 \u00b0F to 82 \u00b0F over six hours, but the results were similar in all of the thermoses we tested. (Solids like pasta cool more quickly than liquids, so any thermos is most effective when used with soup, stew, oatmeal, or other liquidy foods.)\nReassembly can be difficult. Although we like that the Zojirushi\u2019s multi-part lid is easy to clean, it\u2019s a bit more difficult to put back together afterward. The rubber gasket is tricky to get on, and keeping track of the small four parts takes effort. Also, unlike the lids of some larger thermoses, the Zojirushi\u2019s lid doesn\u2019t double as a cup, so you will likely eat straight from the jar.\nThe pieces are easy to misplace. Anna ended up losing a small rubber stopper that plugs into the top part of the lid. This didn\u2019t affect heat retention, but sometimes foods would leak into the thermos\u2019s cap. So she prioritized unscrewing all of the parts of the lid to make sure she could get it really clean. Despite this minor leak due to the missing piece, the Zojirushi never leaked outside of the container itself.\nThe colored coating can scratch easily. We tested a jar with the stainless finish, but we have read several Amazon reviews noting that the coating on the blue, pink, and tan versions of the food jar can scratch. We\u2019ve also found that the finish on Zojirushi\u2019s travel mugs can develop small nicks and scuffs over time, but this wear and tear doesn\u2019t affect performance.\nAlso great: Thermos Funtainer Food Jar\nIn our tests, the 10-ounce Thermos Funtainer kept food hot, didn\u2019t leak, didn\u2019t break when dropped, and was easy to clean.\nWe prefer it for kids over the 12-ounce Zojirushi because it comes in an array of fun prints and colors, and the slightly smaller size will be easier for kids to use. The Funtainer also costs less, which is helpful if it gets lost and needs replacing.\nThe Funtainer is best for small portions. The Funtainer fits neatly into smaller lunch boxes like the L.L. Bean lunchbox we recommend for both kids and adults, and can hold a 10-ounce serving of noodles, veggie chili, or hot cereal.\nBut it doesn\u2019t keep food hot for as long. Although the Funtainer kept foods hot, it didn\u2019t do as well as the Zojirushi: after four hours, soup in the Funtainer had cooled from 193 \u00baF to 147 \u00b0F, and at six hours, it measured 130 \u00b0F. In comparison, the Zojirushi kept soup at a hotter 144 \u00b0F after six hours.\nIt\u2019s durable and easy to open. None of the thermoses, including the Funtainer, leaked in our tests. The Funtainer's plastic lid didn\u2019t break during our drop tests, faring much better than the competition.\nThe Funtainer\u2019s lid doesn\u2019t get slippery when wet and is also easy to twist on and off.\nWith its uniform, cylindrical shape, the Funtainer fits easily into all of our lunch box picks. It also comes in a variety of prints and colors that will appeal to kids of different ages (and adults can select a solid color option).\nThermos offers a 30-day warranty period for defective products.\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\nAgain, it\u2019s not good at keeping cold foods cold. None of the thermoses we tested were able to keep cold foods at food-safe temperatures during our tests, including the Funtainer. After two hours, tuna salad that started at 40 \u00b0F rose to 49 \u00b0F; at six hours, it measured 63 \u00b0F. If you\u2019re nervous about this, pack the thermos in a bag or lunch box with ice packs, to help foods stay colder for longer.\nIt doesn\u2019t fully come apart for cleaning. The Funtainer has a removable rubber ring to seal the thermos, but since it doesn\u2019t totally come apart, it\u2019s a little harder to clean.\nCare and maintenance\nTo keep foods hotter for longer, both Thermos and Zojirushi recommend preheating your thermos by filling it with hot water for five to 10 minutes before dumping it out and adding foods. You can do the same thing with ice water to pre-chill your thermos before adding cold foods.\nLike most of the thermoses we looked at, the Zojirushi is not dishwasher-safe, and it needs to be hand-washed. Putting it in the dishwasher can degrade its ability to retain heat.\nThe Funtainer is top-rack dishwasher-safe, but Thermos still recommends hand-washing it because \u201charsher detergents and hot water may affect the appearance.\u201d To clean the hard-to-reach places in the Funtainer\u2019s lid, we recommend soaking it in warm, soapy water.\nThe competition\nThe Thermos Stainless King 16 Ounce Food Jar with Folding Spoon kept soup hotter than most of the competition in our tests. But it has a wider girth and a bulkier, ridged shape compared with our pick, so it\u2019s harder to hold and to fit in a lunchbox.\nThe Black and Blum Food Flask\u2019s brushed steel and smooth curves are sleek, and the faux leather strap and spoon attachment charmed us. But the flask isn\u2019t as widely available as our pick, and the strap-and-spoon contraption isn\u2019t functional\u2014the spoon would be exposed to germs in a bag, and the strap stains easily.\nWe like the affordable MIRA Lunch Food Jar, but it didn\u2019t keep soup as hot as most of the other thermoses we tested.\nThe lid from IKEA\u2019s Efterfragad Vacuum Food Container broke during testing.\nWe also tested the Hydro Flask Food Flask Thermos Jar, the Stanley Classic Vacuum Food Jar, the Simple Modern Rover Food Thermos, and the Contigo Stainless Steel Food Jar, all of which are now unavailable across multiple retailers.\nAnna Perling wrote the original version of this guide.
