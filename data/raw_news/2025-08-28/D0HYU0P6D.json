Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nIf your Wi-Fi signal is struggling to reach every corner of your home, a signal booster \u2014 also known as a Wi-Fi extender \u2014 might be the fix you need. Whether you're dealing with annoying dead zones, buffering video calls or laggy gaming sessions, the right Wi-Fi extender can help expand coverage and improve connectivity without forcing you to move your router.\n\n\n\nThere are different types of Wi-Fi extenders to choose from. Some models use external antennas to push the signal farther, while others, like mesh extenders, create a seamless, whole-home network. If you're simply looking to extend coverage into a specific room, a Wi-Fi repeater can do the job \u2014 but it may cut your bandwidth in half. More advanced extenders, however, can help maintain strong speeds and reliability throughout your home.\n\n\n\nWe've rounded up the best Wi-Fi extenders to suit different needs, whether you're looking for an affordable fix or a high-performance upgrade.\n\u2022 None What to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\n\nMaximum transfer rate: 2402 Mbps | Range: 110 feet | Number of antennas: 2 | Number of USB ports: 0 | Wi-Fi 6: Yes | Number of bands: 2 | Wi-Fi speed: 5GHz (2402 Mbps), 2.4GHz (574 Mbps) TP-Link has a bunch of Wi-Fi extenders under its umbrella, but the one that will likely serve most people the best is this AX3000 model, which comes in two variations: the RE700X and the RE705X. Both extenders have the same specs, including Wi-Fi 6 support, but the 705X has a slightly different design with pull-out antennas on either side. I tested the 705X, so I\u2019m basing my recommendation off of my experience with that model, specifically. Setting up this extender was as easy as plugging it in and following instructions in TP-Link\u2019s Tether mobile app. All of the devices I tried followed the same basic setup process: first, plug in the extender close to your wireless router, follow instructions in a mobile app or on a setup webpage, and once the connection is established, move the extender to your desired location. It took all of five minutes to pair the 705X with my Verizon FiOS router \u2013 probably the most time-consuming bit was deciding what I wanted to name the new 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz networks. I went with the same name for both because I didn\u2019t want to manually choose from two different bands when connecting things like my phone or laptop. The device will automatically pair your device with the appropriate band \u2014 for example, connecting most smart home gadgets to the 2.4Ghz network, which often helps reduce latency. The permanent location where I moved all of the extenders I tested was in my basement, since that\u2019s where we can get the spottiest Wi-Fi signal. I first ran speed tests on my iPhone and MacBook using Speedtest.net and Speedcheck.org so I could compare them with the standard speeds I got when connected to my router\u2019s main network. Unsurprisingly, the speeds generated by TP-Link\u2019s extender were much slower than those from my router\u2019s network, but that was the case with all of the devices I tested. Only our top pick (see below) got close to my router\u2019s standard speeds, but I expected this. Wi-Fi extenders aren\u2019t going to make your connection better \u2013 they\u2019re just going to give you a wider area of coverage. From a spec perspective, both the 705X and the 700X are rated for speeds up to 2402 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 574 Mbps on 2.4GHz band. Despite the results of my tests, I was happy to discover that I wasn\u2019t held back by the 705X\u2019s seemingly slower speeds. I worked as normal for hours with my phone and laptop connected to the extenders wireless network, answering emails, messaging in Slack, streaming YouTube videos and otherwise maintaining a few dozen tabs in Chrome, without any hiccups or noticeable slow-downs. I was not surprised to find TP-Link\u2019s Tether companion app to be easy to use, if a little simple, because that was my experience with TP-Link\u2019s smart home app. Tether is specifically used with the company\u2019s networking devices, and you probably won\u2019t spend a ton of time in it after initial setup. I especially like that you can name wireless devices that are connected to your extenders network like your phone and smart TV. That makes it much easier to know which things in your home are constantly paired with the extender rather than your router\u2019s default network. One important thing to note with these TP-Link extenders is that they both support OneMesh, which is the company\u2019s feature that allows you to create one seamless network if you have a compatible mesh router. Since I\u2019m still using the router provided to me by my ISP, I wasn\u2019t able to test out this feature, but it works like this: if you have a OneMesh router and OneMesh-compatible extenders, you can link them all together under the same network name. So rather than having a router network and an extender network under the same roof, everything would be linked and filed under your main network\u2019s name. It\u2019s a small perk that becomes not so small if you have a spotty extender, or even just an awkwardly laid-out home. In my testing, I found my phone disconnecting from some extenders\u2019 networks when I went upstairs to the main floor of the house from my basement. It would then attempt to reconnect to the extender network, when really I would have preferred it to default back to my router\u2019s network. That thankfully didn\u2019t happen with TP-Link\u2019s RE705X, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind when considering buying a Wi-Fi extender at all. If you can get one that has a feature like OneMesh, it\u2019ll make your life much easier. Coming in at $130 and $120, respectively, the RE705X and RE700X may not be the cheapest Wi-Fi extenders out there, but their coverage range, latest Wi-Fi support and max speeds make either of them a good pick. If you know exactly where you want to put an extender and it\u2019s not in an awkward or hard-to-reach location, the slightly cheaper, antenna-free RE700X may work just fine for you. But if you want that extra ability to tweak antennas to suit your needs, the RE705X is the way to go. $130 at Best Buy\n\nMaximum transfer rate: 4800 Mbps | Range: 2500 sq.ft | Number of antennas: 2 | Number of USB ports: 1 x USB 3.0 | Wi-Fi 6: Yes | Number of bands: 2 | Wi-Fi speed: 5GHz (4.8 Gbps), 2.4GHz (1.2 Gbps) Having more than one Wi-Fi network in your house is par for the course when it comes to adding an extender into the mix. But that\u2019s not so with the Netgear EAX80 mesh network range extender \u2013 it has \u201cseamless smart roaming,\u201d which allows you to set it up under your existing SSID name. So instead of disconnecting from your main wireless network and reconnecting to the extender\u2019s network when you move from your living room to your basement, all you have to do is\u2026 move from one room to another and let Netgear\u2019s device do the heavy lifting. That\u2019s one of the premium features included on the EAX80, but its $250 price tag can be attributed more so to some other perks. It\u2019s a dual-band, Wi-Fi 6e mesh range extender that will work with pretty much any wireless router you may have. It supports speeds up to 6 Gbps and can have more than 30 devices connected to it at once. As far as square footage goes, it\u2019ll widen your Wi-Fi's coverage by up to 2,500 square feet, which should be plenty for small and medium-sized homes. It performed well in our speed tests, coming very close to the upload/download speeds I got when being connected to my main network before installing the extender. There\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary about the Nighthawk mobile app, which is what you\u2019ll use to initially set up the EAX80 extender. After that, you can use the app to troubleshoot, check Wi-Fi speeds and see which devices are on your network. It\u2019ll likely be a big list since you\u2019ll see everything that\u2019s paired to your router\u2019s network as well. My only gripe is that you can\u2019t edit device names. For example, my den\u2019s TV shows up as \u201cLGwebOSTV\u201d and our soundbar in our basement shows up as \u201csonyaudio\u201d \u2014 but there are a number of connected devices with no name at all, and we\u2019re just stuck with that. Aside from its fast speeds and reliable connection, two things set this Netgear extender apart from the other devices I tested. First is that seamless smart roaming feature \u2013 not having to switch between Wi-Fi networks when going around my home was super convenient. I never had to worry about my laptop losing connection to a dedicated extender network when I moved from my basement to my second floor, which is something I frequently had to deal with when testing other devices. The second differentiating factor is the EAX80\u2019s design. Unlike other range extenders that are chunky blocks that plug directly into an AC outlet, Netgear\u2019s model looks more like a standalone router. While that does mean it has a larger footprint than other devices I tested, it was actually easier to find good spots for it in my home because it didn\u2019t have to be chained to the wall right above an outlet. Most people, especially those tight on space, will probably prefer the standard extender design, but the EAX80 gave me a bit more flexibility. I also appreciated that the EAX80 has four built-in ports for using an Ethernet cable to physically connect things like TVs, consoles and more, plus one USB-A port for hardwiring a printer. Netgear\u2019s EAX80 range extender is a solid option if you don\u2019t mind dropping a bit of money to get a bunch of convenient features on top of stellar speeds and Wi-Fi 6 support. But it\u2019s worth noting that Netgear has a few options that are similar to the EAX80, but with various differences in speed, coverage and feature set. The most similar is the $130 EAX20 extender, which includes 1,500 square feet of coverage, support for Wi-Fi 6 and up to 1.8Gbps speeds, plus seamless smart roaming capabilities. The wall-plug version of that, the EAX15, is actually a tad more expensive at $140.\n\u2022 \"Seamless smart roaming\" lets you use your existing SSID name $275 at Amazon\n\nThese handy wireless devices do exactly what their name suggests: extend your Wi-Fi network so it covers more areas of your home. Most wireless extenders plug into an AC outlet and connect to your existing router so they can then rebroadcast it to spots that your router alone may not cover well. As a rule of thumb, you\u2019ll get the best results by placing the extender half way between your router and the dead zone you\u2019re trying to fix or improve your W-Fi connection and strengthen the wireless signal.\n\nOne important thing to note about Wi-Fi range extenders (also sometimes called \u201crepeaters\u201d) is that most of them actually create a new Wi-Fi network when rebroadcasting your existing one. That network will have a new name (it\u2019ll often be your default network\u2019s name with an EXT appended at the end, unless you change it) and that means you\u2019ll have to connect to different networks when in different parts of your home. While that\u2019s a small tradeoff in return for improved internet connection, some will be more inconvenienced than others.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather have one, much larger network in your home, you\u2019re better off upgrading to mesh networking systems. Mesh systems come with a main router and a wireless access point or two that, by default, create one large Wi-Fi system that should be accessible throughout your whole home. They tend to be the best Wi-Fi routers you can get, but that also translates to more expensive, and possibly more complicated, devices. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are, by far, more costly than a simple extender, plus you may have to work with your internet service provider to get your home\u2019s existing network working on your new router.\n\nWhat to look for in a Wi-Fi extender\n\nExtenders today can support single, dual or tri-band Wi-Fi, and they will tell you the maximum speeds they support on all of their available bands. For example, one dual-band device might support 600Mbps speeds over its 2.4GHz band and up to 1300Mbps over its 5GHz band, for a combined maximum speed of 1900Mbps. For the best performance, you\u2019ll want to go with a Wi-Fi extender that has the highest speeds possible (and those, as you might expect, tend to cost more). Some extenders even support Wi-Fi 7, giving you the latest in wireless technology for higher bandwidth, faster internet speed and lower latency.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that Wi-Fi extenders are not true \u201csignal boosters\u201d since they are not designed to increase speeds across your home. In fact, you may find that the extender\u2019s network is slower than your router\u2019s. Instead, extenders are designed to increase the strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, making them ideal for filling in dead zones. Some mesh extenders can help create a more seamless network, reducing the drop in speed and improving connectivity in larger spaces.\n\nWith the name of the gaming being coverage area, taking note of a device\u2019s range is important. Depending on the size of your home and property, you may only need up to 1,200 square feet of coverage. But those with larger homes will want to spring for an extender that can support upwards of 2,000+ square feet of coverage.\n\nSimilarly, those with lots of gadgets will want an extender that can handle them all at once. If you spend most of your time on your phone or laptop and maybe have your smart TV online for a few hours of Netflix each day, you could get by with a more limited extender. Smart home aficionados and tech lovers should invest in one that won\u2019t buckle under the pressure of a few dozen connected devices. This is especially important if you plan on linking all of the devices in a certain part of your home to your Wi-Fi range extender\u2019s network, rather than directly to your existing router. Some models with external antennas can improve performance by providing stronger, more directional wireless signal.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a ton of innovation when it comes to design in the Wi-Fi extender space. Most of the ones you\u2019ll find today are rounded rectangles roughly the size of your hand that plug into a standard wall outlet. They usually have a few indicator lights that will show you when the extender is connected, how strong its signal strength is and when there\u2019s a problem, and some will even have moveable external antennas that companies claim provide even better Wi-Fi signal. Generally, they are pretty simple to install and get connected, but if you\u2019re struggling with how to set up your Wi-Fi extender, there are plenty of YouTube videos you can check out.\n\nAside from that, there are the scant few standalone Wi-Fi extenders that sit on an end table or a desk, and those look pretty similar to regular ol\u2019 routers. But make no mistake, anything labeled as an extender or a \u201cWi-Fi repeater\u201d will need an anchor router in order for it to work.\n\nAnother convenient feature you\u2019ll find on most Wi-Fi extenders is an extra Ethernet connection port (or a few). This allows you to use the extender as a wireless access point if you connect it to your existing router, or an adapter to provide devices like TVs, smart home hubs or game consoles a hardwired connection to the internet. Unsurprisingly, this wired connection usually provides you with the fastest speeds possible, so you may want to use it for your most crucial devices.\n\nWhat's the difference between a wifi booster and extender?\n\nNowadays, there\u2019s really no difference between a Wi-Fi booster and Wi-Fi extender - they\u2019re just different names for the same thing. Previously, however, Wi-Fi boosters were devices that received signals from wireless routers, broadcasting them to another network. This essentially extends the range of the signal. Wi-Fi extenders expand the coverage within your home\u2019s Wi-Fi network, but often you will see extenders described as boosters.\n\nIs a Wi-Fi extender better than a mesh router?\n\nMesh routers, or mesh Wi-Fi systems, use multiple devices (or nodes) across your home to create a larger home network. Essentially, you have multiple routers around your home with these systems, and that will hopefully provide the best coverage possible. Wi-Fi extenders, on the other hand, are usually just one device that extends your existing Wi-Fi signal, and they often require you to switch networks when connecting. Wi-Fi extenders are more affordable, though, and are great if you\u2019re traveling or need a Wi-Fi signal in harder-to-reach areas. However, a mesh router can offer a better long-term solution to upgrade your entire home\u2019s Wi-Fi.\n\nSome people may need to use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, for instance, if your home is large or has dead zones in different areas. But if you do use multiple Wi-Fi extenders, there\u2019s a chance of interference. You may also need to manually connect to the extenders separately, which isn\u2019t always convenient.\n\nWhat is the maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender?\n\nThe maximum distance for a Wi-Fi extender varies depending on the model, but most can effectively extend your wireless signal between 800 and 2,500 square feet. Some high-end models may reach even farther, especially if they feature external antennas or are part of a mesh system with additional dedicated wireless access points.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that real-world performance depends on factors like your home's layout, wall materials and interference from other devices. For best results, place your extender about halfway between your router and the area with weak or no Wi-Fi connection. Always check the manufacturer\u2019s specs \u2014 some of our top picks clearly list their expected range so you can find one that fits your space.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the best Wi-Fi extender for 2025, with Engadget testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. The right Wi-FI extender can expand coverage and improve connectivity without requiring the user to move their router. There are different types of Wi-Internet extenders to choose from, with some models using external antennas to extend signal further and others creating seamless, whole-home networks. The article suggests that setting up an extender with a wireless device is simple and easy, with the most difficult part being naming the new 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz networks. However, the article also notes that while these extenders are not likely to improve connection, they will just give you a wider area of coverage.",
  "shortSummary": "The best Wi-Fi extenders for home use are available, offering various options to enhance coverage, reliability, and maintain high-speed internet connectivity without moving your router.",

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best mesh Wi-Fi systems of 2025\nThese are the best routers we tested that can up your home Wi-Fi game.\nA Wi-Fi mesh system is one of the best upgrades you can make to improve your home\u2019s internet coverage, especially if you\u2019ve ever struggled with dead zones, buffering or dropped video calls. Unlike a single router that broadcasts from one central point, a mesh system uses multiple access points spread throughout your space to blanket your entire home with a strong, seamless Wi-Fi signal. Whether you're working on multiple laptops, streaming 4K video in the living room or gaming online in the basement, a mesh setup helps ensure you get reliable Wi-Fi wherever you are.\nThese systems are designed to handle the demands of modern households, offering features like dual-band or even tri-band connectivity to balance your bandwidth across devices, and automatic updates to keep your firmware current. Many also support high-speed internet plans and include options for a wired connection if you need extra stability for gaming or work. With easy setup, smart app controls and long-term future-proofing, the best mesh Wi-Fi router systems can eliminate the need for clunky Wi-Fi extenders and give you fast, dependable Wi-Fi connections across your whole home.\nTable of contents\nBest mesh Wi-Fi systems for 2025\nWireless band count: 3 | Wireless speed rating: Up to 2,402 Mbps (6GHz band) | Ethernet ports: 3 | USB ports: 0 | Coverage area: Up to 7,200 sq. ft.\nRead our full TP-Link Deco XE75 review\nThere\u2019s no single glitzy feature that sets TP-Link\u2019s Deco XE75 apart from its competition. Instead, it expertly balances raw power and user friendliness. If you\u2019re looking for a no-fuss upgrade for your existing wireless router with faster speeds, this is the right option, especially for large homes. It\u2019s not perfect, but my biggest gripes are nitpicks: The power cables are too short and the app could do with a polish. This tri-band mesh Wi-Fi system is the best for most people. In my spacious and wireless-hostile home, the $400 three-pack was almost overkill. If the $300 two-pack can cover your home\u2019s square footage, then it\u2019s a more wallet-friendly proposition than some of its rivals.\nLet\u2019s address the elephant in the room: TP-Link has a Chinese-owned parent company and, late last year, the US began asking if there was a potential national security risk. In a statement, TP-Link Systems said it was \u201cno longer affiliated with China-based TP-Link Technologies\u201d and that its products comply with \u201cregional industry security standards and regulations.\u201d It added the Chinese government does not have access to or control over \u201cthe design and production of our routers,\u201d and that it is engaging with the US government to demonstrate its \u201csecurity practices are fully in line with security standards.\u201d\n- Excellent performance\n- Easy to set up and use\n- A good value for the money\n- App design lacks polish\n- Short power cable\nWireless band count: 3 | Wireless speed rating: Up to 2,402 Mbps (6GHz band) | Ethernet ports: 2 | USB ports: 0 | Coverage area: Up to 6,600 sq. ft.\nRead our full Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro review\nNest Wi-Fi Pro offers a simple experience for folks who want to set their network and then forget all about it. It\u2019s not as powerful, or customizable, as its competitors, but it should be more than suitable for most of your needs, with reliable tri-band Wi-Fi for streaming and web browsing. It\u2019s quite cheap, so while I have reservations about its long-term potential, it\u2019s a great buy for the next few years.\nIf you\u2019re already inside Google\u2019s world, then the various integrations Assistant offers, as well as support for Matter and Thread-equipped smart home devices, is a bonus. Plus, Google promises regular software and security updates, letting you concentrate on enjoying the internet, rather than worrying about it.\n- Super simple to set up and use\n- Relatively affordable\n- Integrates nicely with Google services\n- Doesn't offer as many customizations as some comeptitors\nWireless band count: 3 | Wireless speed rating: Up to 4,804 Mbps (6GHz band) | Ethernet ports: 2 | USB ports: 0 | Coverage area: Up to 3,000 sq. ft.\nASUS\u2019 ZenWiFi Pro ET12 is a \u201cpro\u201d piece of hardware inside and out, with the power (and price) to justify such a name. Each node has the power to cover your home in Wi-Fi, and those extra gigabit and 2.5 Gbps ethernet ports will let you add fast backhaul or a speedy NAS. I\u2019d say pro users and gamers who need faster speeds will find plenty to love in this package. Hell, it\u2019s good enough to support a medium-sized office without too much stress.\nThat\u2019s before you get to ASUS\u2019 AiMesh, which will let you add ASUS\u2019 powerful standalone routers to the same network. You could pick up a ZenWiFi Pro now, and in a year or two bolt on one of its beefy Wi-Fi routers to really boost your speed. Power users will be better equipped to deal with some of its more idiosyncratic control options, and are more likely to take advantage of its support for the 160MHz band.\nIf I\u2019m honest, I started using this and realized pretty quickly that this was simply too much gear for my needs. It\u2019s like needing to buy a blender and coming back from the store with the Large Hadron Collider \u2014 lovely, but probably a little too much overkill for a single glass of kale smoothie.\n- Superb performance\n- Easy to expand system with additional nodes and routers\n- Expensive\nWhat to look for in a mesh Wi-Fi system\nLinksys\u2019 CEO Jonathan Bettino told Engadget why mesh systems are an \u201cadvancement in Wi-Fi technology\u201d over buying a single point router. With one transmitter, the signal can degrade the further away from the router you go, or the local environment isn\u2019t ideal. \u201cYou can have a small [home], but there\u2019s thick walls [...] or things in the way that just interfere with your wireless signal,\u201d he said.\nHistorically, the solution to a home\u2019s Wi-Fi dead zone was to buy a Wi-Fi extender but Bettino said the hardware has both a \u201cterrible user experience\u201d and one of the highest return rates of any consumer electronics product. Mesh Wi-Fi, by comparison, offers \u201cmultiple nodes that can be placed anywhere in your home,\u201d says Bettino, resulting in \u201cubiquitous Wi-Fi\u201d that feels as if you have a \u201crouter in every room.\u201d\nRather than having one main router in your home, having a \u201crouter in every room\u201d is the biggest selling point for mesh Wi-Fi given how reliant we all are on the internet. Each node is in constant contact with each other, broadcasting a single, seamless network to all of your connected devices. There\u2019s no separate network for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, just a single name that you connect to.\nIt\u2019s a good time to buy a mesh Wi-Fi system since the latest standard, Wi-Fi 6E, represents a big leap in the technology. Matt MacPherson, Cisco's Chief Technology Officer for Wireless, said Wi-Fi 6E is a big \u201cinflection point,\u201d using much more of the wireless spectrum than its predecessors. \u201cIf you\u2019re using that spectrum with a Wi-Fi 6 [device],\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get significant gains [in speed.]\u201d\nMacPherson added Wi-Fi 6E will likely \u201ccarry you for a long time\u201d thanks to the fact its \u201ctop throughputs now typically exceed what people can actually connect their home to.\u201d In short, with a top theoretical per-stream speed of 1.2 Gbps, Wi-Fi 6E is fast enough to outrun all but the fastest internet service.\nWhat do all these Wi-Fi numbers and letters mean?\nI\u2019m sorry folks, we need to get boringly technical for one paragraph, but I promise you it\u2019s worth it.\nWi-Fi is governed by International Standard IEEE 802.11, and every few years a letter gets added onto that name when the technology evolves and improves. Until 2019, routers were sold under their IEEE name, leaving users to pick through the word soup of a product labeled 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac and so on.\nMercifully, wiser heads opted to rebrand the letters as numbers, so rather than 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac, we have Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3 4 and 5. Right now, we\u2019re in the middle of one of those Wi-Fi generations, with most of the gear on sale right now supporting either Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E?\nWi-Fi uses chunks of the radio frequency spectrum, with Wi-Fi 6 using the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to pump data around. In fact, back in the old days, it was likely your home router would offer you the choice of the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz network, as separate bands to access. These days, all of the spectrums are tied together as one thing, and Wi-Fi 6E has the added ability to use the 6GHz band as well. That\u2019s a big chunk of extra wireless real estate that isn\u2019t as cluttered up as the 2.4 and 5GHz bands.\nYou\u2019re going to talk about wireless frequencies now, aren\u2019t you.\nEach Wi-Fi band had tradeoffs, because the slower radio frequencies have greater range but less speed. 2.4GHz signals will travel a long way in your home but aren\u2019t quick, while 6GHz is blisteringly fast but can be defeated by a sturdy brick wall. A lot of Wi-Fi-enabled gear you own, like smart home products, only use the 2.4GHz band because the range is better and it\u2019s a lot cheaper. But it means that the band is also overcrowded and slow, making it great for your doorbell and robovac, but lackluster for Twitch streaming.\nSo, what am I looking for?\nRight now, the market is full of mature Wi-Fi 6 and 6E devices, and most new systems available to buy are capable of taking advantage of the faster speeds they offer. This guide focuses on Wi-Fi 6E gear since it\u2019s what we think it\u2019s more than enough to satisfy almost everyone\u2019s at-home Wi-Fi needs.\nWhat about Wi-Fi 7?\nWe\u2019re now seeing the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 devices available to buy, but we don\u2019t recommend you do so immediately. The Wi-Fi 7 standard is still so new that there\u2019s little to no reason for you to rush out and buy one for your home. The hardware is tremendously expensive and while Wi-Fi 7 will, eventually, offer some great benefits over 6E, it\u2019s not as transformative an upgrade as 6E. Not to mention, Wi-Fi 7 is so new that almost none of your home\u2019s devices will be able to take advantage of its big-ticket features. I\u2019d estimate you won\u2019t need to worry about upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 for at least five years, if not longer.\nRange and speed\nAll Wi-Fi routers boast a theoretical broadcast range and a theoretical top speed, and in some cases external antennas to boost signal directionality \u2014 but these figures don\u2019t mean much. After all, manufacturers can\u2019t control your ISP\u2019s real speed, the materials and layout of your home or where you put your Wi-Fi gear. Raw speed isn\u2019t everything, either, and you likely need a lot less than the internet speeds your provider is advertising. What matters more is how consistent your connection is between rooms and across devices.. After all, Netflix needs just 15 Mbps to push a single 4K video stream to your home. As cool as it is to say you\u2019ve got all these hundreds of Mbps, factors like latency and reliability are far more crucial to a happy internet life. And unless you have Gigabit internet that can reach speeds of up to 1 Gbps, you won\u2019t need a mesh router that offers that spec.\nBackhaul\nMesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It\u2019s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination.\nTo combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there\u2019s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems.\nConnectivity\nThese days, even your washing machine can have a wireless connection, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore the joys of wired internet. No matter how fast Wi-Fi is, a hard line will always be faster, and some gear, like Philips\u2019 Hue bridge, still needs an ethernet connection. Plenty of routers can also use these hard connections as backhaul, eliminating further wireless clutter.\nIt\u2019s convenient for spread-out systems and power users, but it will mean running more wires through your home. The most common standard is Cat 5e, or gigabit ethernet which, unsurprisingly, has a top speed of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). Since Ethernet cables are backward compatible, you should be able to easily find one that works with your system. However, to get the most out of your mesh routers, it\u2019s worth investing in an Ethernet cable that meets the standard your router uses \u2014 if it\u2019s Cat 5e, use a Cat 5e cable. You can check your router\u2019s specs via the manufacturer\u2019s website to be sure.\nFlexibility and scalability\nMesh routers enable you to add (or subtract) modules from your home network to suit your needs. D-Link\u2019s Alan Jones said users should \u201ccheck how scalable the prospective product is\u201d before you buy. This sense of scale doesn\u2019t just apply to the number of nodes on the network, but how many simultaneous connections it can handle.\nIt\u2019s also worth looking at ASUS\u2019 AiMesh products, which can combine mesh Wi-Fi gear and its standard \u201cspider\u201d Wi-Fi routers. If you\u2019ve got a tricky part of your home, you can bolt on an ultra-power standalone Wi-Fi router to a compatible mesh.\nPlacement\nMesh networks replace one big piece of hardware with a series of identical nodes that you scatter around your home. You connect one to your modem (usually over ethernet), and then scatter the rest around the place for the best coverage. A good rule of thumb is to place each node no more than two rooms away from the last one, rather than sticking them at the far ends of your home.\nBear in mind, every physical obstacle between a Wi-Fi node, its siblings and your devices will hurt your overall performance. You should aim to place them, at the very least, at waist height on furniture in open air, without too many obstructions. The reason many mesh Wi-Fi products are designed to look like an inoffensive white doodad is so you don\u2019t feel compelled to hide them behind your TV.\nOther mesh Wi-Fi router systems we tested\nAmazon Eero Pro 7\nEero built its reputation on easy to use yet powerful mesh systems that offer a lot of good in a relatively small and affordable package. Setup is effortless, the app running things is clean and simple, and you get the added benefit of backwards compatibility with older hardware. Sadly, the issue with every Eero system is that so many basic management features, like parental controls, are paywalled behind the company\u2019s Eero Plus subscription for $100 a year.\nAmazon Eero 6E\nEero Pro 6E is an \u201ceasy\u201d device, the sort a total novice can set up on their own and thrive with for years on end. There\u2019s little brainwork required to get things set up, and the app has a clean UI with plenty of hand-holding. But, as with the Eero Pro 7, the fact that so many basic management tools are paywalled irks me, especially since you can get plenty of them for free with Google\u2019s rival offering.\nNetgear Orbi 960\nThe Orbi 96T0 (RBKE963) is Netgear\u2019s flagship mesh Wi-Fi product, which the company calls the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful Wi-Fi 6E system.\u201d It\u2019s also one of the most expensive consumer-level kits on the market, setting you back $1,499.99 for a three pack. It's a fantastic piece of gear, but it's worth saying that the subset of people who could, would or should buy it remains far smaller than you might expect. Ultimately, I feel that if you\u2019re paying luxury prices, you should expect a luxury product. There were plenty of times during testing that I went looking for a feature that was either only available via the web client, or behind a paywall. While, yes, much of your cash is going to the superlative hardware, but for this sort of money, the fact you have to pay extra for some table-stakes features is insulting. If you\u2019re looking for a new Wi-Fi system and aren\u2019t prepared to spend almost $1,500, it\u2019s worth considering our other top picks for the best Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems.\nHow we test Wi-Fi routers\nMy home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories with the office on the third floor. It\u2019s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and the three bedrooms on the first floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old-school lathe and plaster as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major Wi-Fi dead zones in the house: The bathroom and the third bedroom behind it, since there\u2019s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors.\nFor mesh routers with two nodes, I place the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem with the second on the first floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third goes in my kitchen, which I\u2019ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in Wi-Fi. Fundamentally, my home poses enough challenges that if it succeeds here, it stands a very good chance of succeeding in your place.\nEach mesh is judged on ease of setup, Wi-Fi coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features that it advertises. I look at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice rather than an expert given you shouldn\u2019t need to be a network engineer to do this sort of thing. Tests I do include checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency of connectivity and streaming multiple videos at once to replicate common usage patterns."
