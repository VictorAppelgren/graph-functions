      "text": "The 4% rule is now the 4.7% rule. That matters for your retirement.\nThree decades ago, financial adviser Bill Bengen created a retirement principle called the 4% rule. It went viral.\nNow, the rule is getting an update.\nThe 4% rule says you should plan to spend 4% of your savings in the first year of retirement, and spend the same amount, adjusted for inflation, every year after that.\nIt caught on because it\u2019s a simple formula to solve a complex problem: how to fund your retirement.\nThe 4% rule has drawn praise and pillory for years. Now, Bengen says it\u2019s time for a revision: The 4% rule has become the 4.7% rule.\nThe revision illustrates both the strength and weakness of the original 4% rule.\nThe rule endures as one of the best-known concepts in personal finance, brilliant in its simplicity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s lasted a long time because it\u2019s memorable and it makes a very complex human problem feel a lot more manageable,\" said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at Charles Schwab.\nBut some retirement experts say the rule is a little too simple. It dates to an era when many savers put half their money in stocks, half in bonds, the allocation Bengen used to formulate his original rule.\nNowadays, financial advisers often recommend that retirement savers diversify across a much longer list of \u201casset classes,\u201d which might include several types of stocks and bonds, real estate, cash and cash-equivalents. And fewer investors park half their money in the bond market.\nHow the 4% rule became the 4.7% rule\nThe 4% rule began in 1994 as some math in a paper Bengen wrote for the Journal of Financial Planning. If retirees started out with that rate of spending, Bengen reasoned, their savings would last 30 years. (The actual figure was 4.15%. He rounded down.)\nThe rule took off, surprising even its author.\n\u201cIt is surreal,\u201d Bengen said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m still doing this, 30 years later.\u201d\nBengen has continued to refine the rule, along with his own investment habits. Thirty years ago, his research focused on an equal mix of U.S. government bonds and large-company stocks. Today, he works with a broader investment portfolio, including stocks for large, medium and small companies, international stocks, bonds and Treasury bills.\n\u201cI\u2019m up to seven asset classes now,\u201d he said.\nBengen\u2019s calculations now assume a slightly less conservative mix of 55% stocks, 40% bonds and 5% cash.\nThe broader portfolio, coupled with strong stock performance in recent years, changed the math for Bengen\u2019s rule. For a new book, published in August, he posited the 4.7% rule.\n\u201cThe primary reason for the change is that my research has gotten more sophisticated,\u201d he said.\nBengen practices what he preaches, more or less. When he retired in 2013, he followed an updated version of his own rule, spending 4.5% of his savings in the first year.\n\u201cAnd that turned out to be too conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the stock market has done so well, I\u2019ve been able to adjust upwards.\u201d\nHe\u2019s now spending 4.9% a year.\nIs the 4% rule still valid?\nThe 4% rule remains ubiquitous in financial planning. It is also the subject of endless critiques, in articles that question whether the rule still works or suggest it might no longer apply to most of us.\n\u201cThe 4% was a general rule of thumb, but the reality is, people really have to look at the true price of what it costs to be them in retirement, or the them they want to be,\u201d said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia.\nWilliams, of Schwab, said the 4% rule remains \u201ca good place to start.\u201d But a modern retirement plan, he said, is a living document. Retirees and their advisers can update spending targets every year, based on life changes, investment returns, inflation and other factors.\n\u201cMost folks that I talk to, their spending patterns over the 20 to 30 years they are retired are not static. They are dynamic,\u201d said Douglas Ornstein, a director with TIAA Wealth Management.\nOne reason for the enduring popularity of the 4% rule is that it speaks to a paramount fear of Americans approaching retirement: outliving your money. A recent survey, from Allianz Life, suggests we fear running out of money more than death itself.\n\u201cAs humans, when we have complicated challenges, like how much do we spend in retirement, that\u2019s a scary question,\u201d Williams said.\nMany retirees follow the 4% rule. Some get it wrong.\nMany retirees follow Bengen\u2019s rule to the letter.\n\u201cI know some people do take it literally, because I get emails from people all over, every day,\u201d Bengen said.\nNot everyone gets the rule right. Some retirees mistakenly think the aim is to spend exactly 4% of your savings every year, Bengen said.\nHere\u2019s how the original rule actually works:\nIf you retire with $500,000 in savings, you spend $20,000 in the first year to supplement Social Security and any other income. If the inflation rate is 3%, you spend $20,600 in year two. And so on.\nHerein lies another problem with the 4% rule: It seems to work better for the well-heeled.\nThe typical American in the 55-to-65 age range has about $185,000 in household retirement savings, according to the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances.\nApply the 4% rule to $185,000 and you get $7,400 a year: Not much money.\n\u201cThere are a lot of families out there who have no retirement savings at all,\u201d said Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist at Morningstar.\nBengen\u2019s rule is conservative. He formulated it to cover retirees in every economic scenario, with a spending rate that ensured savings would last through retirement.\nThe rule is based \u201con research that was trying to find the worst case among all retirees for the last 100 years,\u201d Bengen said. \u201cI think some retirees, a lot of retirees, should probably spend more.\u201d"

      "text": "'Trump Accounts' are $1k of free money. Here's how to claim it.\nEvery child born between 2025 and 2028 is getting a baby shower gift from Congress and the president: a $1,000 deposit into a \u201cTrump Account.\u201d\nIt\u2019s free money, but your baby can\u2019t spend it. Think of \"Trump Accounts\" as seed money, basically, to encourage children and families to save and build wealth for the many expenses of adulthood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an IRA for kids,\u201d said Evan Morgan, a principal in the tax advisory group at Kaufman Rossin, an accounting and advisory firm.\nTrump Accounts are part of the tax and spending package signed into law this summer by President Donald Trump. They join a crowded field of tax-advantaged savings plans that help Americans navigate the costs of education, health care and retirement, among other things.\nWhat\u2019s unusual, in this case, is that the accounts start at birth, and with a $1,000 balance.\n\u201cTo me, if I drew a best-case scenario on that thousand dollars, it would be sitting in that IRA, compounding, until I retired,\u201d said J. Spencer Williams, founder and CEO of the Retirement Clearinghouse, a financial technology firm.\nHow do 'Trump Accounts' work?\nHere\u2019s how the accounts work, according to analyses from Morningstar, the Tax Foundation and other sources:\nThe government pledges to create an account for any baby born between 2025 and 2028, and to fund it with a one-time deposit of $1,000. To qualify, the baby need only have a Social Security number.\nParents and others may contribute up to $5,000 a year into the accounts until the child turns 18. An employer may contribute up to $2,500 toward the $5,000 cap. State and local governments and private charities will be allowed to make broad contributions.\nNo one may contribute to the accounts until July 2026. Other details are still being ironed out.\nTo claim an account, parents probably will have to check a box on a tax form testifying that they are new parents, said Williams of the Retirement Clearinghouse.\nThe new law requires that Trump Account funds be invested in low-cost stock index funds, which mirror the performance of an index such as the S&P 500.\nAfter age 18, Trump Accounts act like IRAs\nParent contributions are after-tax, but that money is not taxable when it is withdrawn. Any earnings on the contributions, however, are taxed when you withdraw them.\nYou can\u2019t generally withdraw money from a Trump Account until the year a child turns 18. After that, it functions like a traditional Individual Retirement Account.\nThat means, 20 or 30 years from now, a young adult with a Trump Account will be able to withdraw money to cover education expenses or a first-time home purchase without penalties.\nYou can also hold onto the money until retirement. At age 59 \u00bd, the early-withdrawal penalties go away.\nThe accounts originally were designed to be spent by children in young adulthood. The Senate restructured them into something more like a conventional IRA.\n\u201cThis became nothing but a retirement account, at the end of the day. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d said Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA in Southern California.\nThe last-minute changes left many people confused about Trump Accounts. Ringbauer said he has fielded questions from clients.\n\u201cWe have to correct all the misinformation that\u2019s out there,\u201d he said.\nAre Trump Accounts a good investment?\nGiven the promise of free money from the government, Ringbauer said, it\u2019s hard to imagine many parents will pass up a chance to acquire the accounts.\n\u201cAnything is better than nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many kids who start out with nothing.\u201d\nThe harder question, perhaps, is whether parents should actively contribute to the accounts over the next 18 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s free money. The question is whether you would add onto it,\u201d said Monique Morrissey, a senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\nIf your goal is to save for a child\u2019s education, a 529 education savings account \u201coffers more flexibility and tax benefits,\u201d according to a Tax Foundation analysis.\n\u201cI think most parents are going to be better off saving in a 529 for their children rather than this new Trump Account, but it certainly makes sense to collect on the $1,000 contribution,\u201d said Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\nBoccia calls Trump Accounts \u201ca blatant giveaway, and a way for the Trump administration, in their hopes, to leave a permanent mark by naming a rather useless savings account after the current president.\u201d\nMorrissey predicts Trump Accounts will become \u201ca niche thing,\u201d favored by parents with large portfolios and paid investment advisers. \u201cI don\u2019t think these are going to take off in a big way,\u201d she said.\nThe Tax Foundation notes that the U.S. tax code already provides for \u201cat least 11 different tax-advantaged savings vehicles, each with different rules, limitations and regulations.\u201d\nTrump Accounts encourage long-term saving\nOn the other hand, a Trump Account encourages the kind of long-term retirement saving that financial planners generally recommend. The earlier you invest, the more your investments are likely to grow before you cash them out.\n\u201cI\u2019d call it an 18-year head start to retirement,\u201d said Neal Ringquist, executive vice president of the Retirement Clearinghouse.\nTrue, Trump Accounts add another layer of complexity to the tax code. But there\u2019s nothing to stop account holders from consolidating their Trump Accounts with other retirement accounts once they reach adulthood.\n\u201cIf the money isn\u2019t used, it becomes an ordinary, traditional IRA in its adult life,\u201d Williams said.\nThe initiative will cost an estimated $15 billion through 2034, at a time when the U.S. government faces a $37 trillion national debt.\nEven so, proponents hope the new accounts will inspire a generation of children to gain financial literacy as they build wealth for adulthood.\n\u201cThis is a really big step forward,\u201d Williams said, \u201cin terms of using the American free market and the opportunity for growth and compounding to help people save for whatever comes next.\u201d"

      "text": "Social Security cuts aren't the biggest threat to your retirement\nIf you've been following the news on Social Security, you may have heard recently that the program is even closer to potentially having to cut benefits. And unfortunately, that's not just a rumor.\nThe most recent Social Security Trustees report contained a pretty dire update. The program's combined trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Once that happens, Social Security may have to cut benefits to the tune of 19%, leaving retirees with just 81% of the monthly checks they'd normally be entitled to.\nIf you're still working, you might assume that not being able to collect your Social Security benefits in full could seriously upend your retirement. But there's another factor that could cause you even more financial pain once your career comes to an end.\nThis mistake could cost you more than Social Security cuts\nClearly, the idea of losing 19% of your future Social Security checks is scary. But if you don't save decently for retirement, you could end up in an even scarier situation.\nOne thing to realize about Social Security is that even if benefits are not cut, they'll still only replace about 40% of your pre-retirement wages, assuming you earn a pretty typical salary. Now it's true that retirees can often get by on less money than they needed when they were working. But the general rule of thumb is to expect to need 70% to 80% of your former income in retirement \u2014 not 40%.\nFor some context, the typical Social Security recipient today gets about $2,000 a month. If you're a higher earner, you might get more.\nBut either way, you cannot expect those monthly benefits to cover all of your retirement needs \u2014 not even close. So if you don't make an effort to save for retirement, you could end up in a truly bad spot even if Social Security doesn't end up cutting benefits at all.\nAnd to be clear, it's possible that Social Security won't have to move forward with benefit cuts. Though the program's finances are in trouble, lawmakers can look at different ways to avoid a sweeping reduction in benefits.\nAt that point, though, it'll still be on you to help ensure that you don't end up struggling. Relying on Social Security alone is not a good idea, no matter what happens with it.\nSlow and steady wins the race\nThe idea of building a sizable retirement nest egg might seem daunting. But if you give yourself plenty of time to do it, you may be surprised at how seamlessly those 401(k) or IRA contributions fit into your budget.\nImagine you start saving for retirement at age 30, contributing $300 a month. If your portfolio gives you an 8% yearly return, which is a bit below the stock market's average, then by age 65, you could be sitting on about $620,000.\nNow, let's say you want to limit your withdrawals from savings to 4% per year, which is what experts have long recommended. That gives you about $25,000 of income, which is a nice supplement to your Social Security and a nice cushion against benefit cuts if they do come to be.\nIt's too soon to know what will happen as far as Social Security cuts are concerned. But even if lawmakers can prevent them, you need extra retirement income \u2014 period.

      "text": "Fast food used to be a cheap meal option. Why has that changed?\nFast-food restaurants, once the first stop for Americans looking to get at least one meal in before a long work day, are fighting to win back customers.\nBreakfast sales across the fast-food sector have seen declines, the leaders of McDonald's and Wendy's said during early August earnings calls. Families are reevaluating whether the quick trip to the drive-through is worth the price, too, experts told USA TODAY.\nIn response, some chains are adjusting prices. But, with Americans once again feeling the effects of inflation, it's unclear if the moves will be enough in the near term to bring back customers.\nWhat is happening with fast-food restaurants and prices?\nSome value equations no longer balance due to inflation, said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at the research and analytics firm GlobalData.\n\"McDonald\u2019s, for example, is supposed to be an inexpensive treat or a cheap fast-food fix. It is now a relatively expensive purchase, especially for a family,\" Saunders told USA TODAY. \"Many don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the money, so they cut back on dining there.\"\nRestaurants are responding by offering deals. Pizza Hut recently ended a $2 Tuesday personal pan pizza deal, which became so popular during it's original July promotion it was extended until Aug. 26.\nMcDonald's will lower the price of its value meals in September after consumers complained about Big Mac meals that had climbed to $18 in some places, the Wall Street Journal and CNN reported, citing anonymous sources. The price cut follows weeks of discussions between McDonald's corporate officers and restaurant franchise operators, including the company offering financial support if the franchisees would agree to drop prices, the Journal reported.\nMcDonald's declined to comment on the Journal's reported pricing changes but told USA TODAY, \"Great value has always been part of McDonald\u2019s DNA, and that commitment remains strong today.\"\nNationwide, 95% of McDonald's are owned by franchise owners, who ultimately make the pricing decisions for their locations after McDonald's offers suggestions, but franchisees can vote on certain price points or national campaigns, said Peter Saleh, managing director for research for BTIG.\nWhy have prices gone up for fast-food restaurants?\nCosts for restaurants, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, have put stresses on the operators, said Saleh, who examines restaurants and food distribution. Plus, fast-food franchisees have dealt with increases in royalty rates and rents on new units, he said.\nInflation and increased labor costs, especially when there was a push to increase minimum wage to $15 and above in many states, has meant higher costs, he said. Those get passed on to consumers, he said.\n\"From 2019 to 2023, McDonald's had to raise prices by 40% to offset inflation,\" Saleh told USA TODAY. \"Over a five-year period, they typically would have taken 2% to 2.5% or maybe 10% to 12% (due to COVID-19). They needed to take 40%. Chipotle took 35%.\"\nIf leaders in the industry had to raise their prices that much, Saleh said, other competitors did the same.\nHowever, Saleh said in the casual dining space, where customers have more of a sit-down meal, many restaurants only increased prices 20% to 25%.\n\"So what happened?\" Saleh asked. \"The value for your money at casual dining improved relative to the quick-service space.\"\nQuick service, or fast-food operators, are more dependent on hourly labor than casual dining, where there are more tipped employees making a smaller base rate, he said.\nA May 2024 open letter from Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, said the costs of salaries, food and paper had increased approximately 40% in the last five years and the average price of McDonald's menu items was also up 40% during that same time.\nWill reducing the price of combo meals help drive up sales?\n\"Cutting prices helps to solve the problem of McDonald\u2019s being seen as too expensive,\" said Saunders. \"The question is whether the price cuts are enough. Prices are still very elevated over where they once were and it is spooking the consumer.\"\nBefore the pandemic, McDonald's sales off their value meal menu was somewhere between 10% and 12%, said Saleh. Today, the $5 McDonald's value meal, their buy-one-get-one offerings and all the discounts you can get through the app are more than 30% of their sales, said Saleh.\n\"I think they would want it much lower than that,\" said Saleh.\nWhy are breakfast foods at McDonald's and Wendy's not doing well?\nSaunders and Saleh echoed the same sentiments the leaders of McDonald's and Wendy's shared about slumping breakfast sales.\n\"Breakfast is a relatively easy sacrifice as people can fix themselves something at home and save some money,\" said Saunders.\nComing out of the pandemic, there are also fewer people traveling to work every day, said Saleh.\nMcDonald's CEO Chris Kemczynski acknowledged the hit to breakfast sales during an Aug. 6 earnings call after reporting overall sales had improved after a sluggish start to the year.\n\"You're seeing people either skip occasions, so they're skipping a day part like breakfast, or they're trading down either within our menu or they're trading down to eating at home,\" he said during the earnings call (a \"day part\" is an industry term for a meal during the day).\nKen Cook, Wendy's interim CEO and CFO also said during an earnings call on Aug. 8 that \"when consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they do that with, so yes, breakfast continues to perform worse than the rest of the day.\"\nAre McDonald's changes meant to target a specific demographic?\n\"Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle and high income consumers,\" Kemczynski said during the earnings call.\nSaleh said McDonald's is \"definitely targeting the lower-income consumer.\"\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer. I think we could all speculate the reasons for that: probably tariffs and the impact that that might have and questions around employment,\" he said.\nVisits by lower-income consumers to quick-service restaurants were down double digits in the second quarter, Ian Borden, McDonald's chief financial officer said during the earnings call. Middle-income consumer traffic was \"marginally positive\" compared to the first quarter and the higher-income consumer continues to grow visits, he said.\nBut Saunders said \"the price cuts are not really aimed at any one demographic as the feelings of prices being too high is widespread. However, family diners may benefit most as they are bringing multiple people so their checks are much higher.\"\nWhat can fast-food operators do to regain consumers?\nCutting prices and offering value meals and deals are key ways of making fast food more appealing to people's budgets, said Saunders. However, beyond that, menu innovation with exciting new options is another way to drive some traffic, he said.\nThe restaurants that offer the best deals \"call it everyday value and are known for that,\" said Saleh. He pointed to Domino's mix and match offers where you can get two medium, two topping pizzas for $6.99 each or $7.99 large pizza specials.\n\"For like 20 bucks, if you really wanted to at Domino's, you can feed a family of four. You can't really do that in other segments,\" said Saleh. \"You can't do that at McDonald's or casual dining. So the ones that have that deep value I think do extraordinarily well and seem to be winning.\"\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Billionaire couple lists most expensive home in US for sale. See price.\n\u201cThis is a very unique and special property,\u201d Mandy Welgos, the broker associate who is the listing agent for the property, told a local outlet. \u201cNothing like this exists in Aspen.\u201d\nThe most expensive home in the United States is officially on the market, and it'll cost whoever purchases it a whopping $300 million.\nThe over 27,000 square foot, 74.1-acre estate is located at 161 Stillwater Drive in Aspen, Colorado, and it includes 18 bedrooms, 20 full bathrooms and four partial bathrooms, according to the listing by Sotheby's International Realty.\nThe property, named \"Little Lake Lodge\" in the listing, was built in 1994. According to The Aspen Times, the home was built by California billionaires Stewart and Lynda Resnick, who co-own The Wonderful Company, a $6 billion private company that grows, harvests, bottles, packages and markets an array of health-focused products, including FIJI Water and POM Wonderful.\nAccording to Pitkin County property records reviewed by USA TODAY, the Wonderful Company is listed as the owner of the residence.\nSotheby's lists Little Lake Lodge as the most expensive home for sale in the United States, with a property in Long Lake, New York coming in second with a price tag of $125 million.\nHere is what to know about the single-family home, including the annual property taxes its eventual new owner will be paying.\nWhere is Little Lake Lodge?\nAccording to the home's listing, it \"borders public land, yet downtown Aspen is a mere mile away.\" The residence also sits beside a \"pristine, private lake\" that is \"amid thoughtfully chosen native landscaping and preserved wild flora.\"\n\"Given its exceptional scale with four parcels of land, Little Lake Lodge represents the opportunity to establish an enduring legacy of luxury and harmony with a majestic natural setting\u2014an opportunity unlikely to occur again in the great Mountain West,\" the listing says.\nMandy Welgos, the Sotheby\u2019s International Realty broker associate who is the listing agent for the property, told The Aspen Times that the high asking price is attributed to the home's many features, including the four parcels of land, its proximity to downtown Aspen, the private six-acre lake it sits beside, its privacy, 45 parking spaces and the trail system near it that is \"built for hiking, cross country skiing, and biking.\"\nWelgos added that there are currently multiple interested parties since the home was listed for sale earlier this month. Despite the home's high value, she told the outlet the property may continue to appreciate for its new owners, especially with the restrictions on the size of homes allowed in Pitkin County.\nIn November 2023, the Pitkin County commissioners finalized a new rule to reduce the maximum house size from 15,000 to 9,250 square feet, the Aspen Daily News reported. When Little Lake Lodge was built in 1994, any home with more than 15,000 square feet of livable space had to undergo a special review, according to a report by Aspen Snowmass Sotheby's Broker Tim Estin.\n\u201cThis is a very unique and special property,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing like this exists in Aspen.\u201d\nTo date, Aspen\u2019s highest single-family home sale was $108 million in 2024, which was also the highest residential sale in Colorado at that time, The Aspen Times reported. This record will stand until the Resnick\u2019s property sells.\nUSA TODAY contacted Welgos multiple times, but as of Saturday, Aug. 30, has not received a response.\nHow much will property taxes be for $300 million home?\nThe listing for the home states that the estimated annual property taxes for the new homeowner will be roughly $131,755.\nPitkin County's property tax rate is approximately 0.3%-0.5% of a property's assessed value, according to Avant Garde Aspen, a real estate company in the area. For example, a $10 million home in Aspen will have a property tax bill of between $30,000 and $50,000 per year, the company added."

      "text": "5 standout SUVs in 2025 reviewed and recommended by our experts\nThey're the most popular vehicle segment in the U.S. for a reason: Everyone wants the space, comfort and styling of the SUV. They can be family cars for weekend sports tournaments and off-roaders for the annual camping trip.\nBut not all SUVs are created equal.\nAmong the many appealing SUV options inundating buyers, automotive critics in the USA TODAY Network have tried plenty. Building insight from first looks and test drives, these are a few terrific SUVs with various powertrains that our critics have enjoyed, along with the features they loved most about them.\n2025 Cadillac Optiq\nIn recent years, Cadillac has leaned into electric powertrains, offering high-performance, luxurious EVs that critics have enjoyed. The 2025 Cadillac Optiq is a successful SUV that impressed Detroit Free Press automotive critic Mark Phelan with great value, impressive power and a glitzy interior.\nAll of those features are packed into a sleek little body, marrying the utility of an SUV with a short, parkable wheelbase that could appeal to city dwellers.\nThe luxury electric SUV starts at $50,900, which is a solid price for Cadillac-style luxury.\n2025 Lincoln Navigator\nAt just about double the price \u2014 $99,995 \u2014 the Lincoln Navigator delivers supreme quality, looks and fancy features.\nFeatures like a sophisticated two-piece tailgate and a 48-inch wide infotainment display help the Navigator stand out among its class of luxury SUVs.\nBut the Navigator is not just a floaty, luxury SUV. It also packs some serious power.\nNavigators come with four-wheel drive powered by a 440-horsepower twin-turbo V6 and 10-speed automatic transmission. Need to tow some cargo? Navigators can tow up to 8,700 pounds, made easier by a \"hitch assist\" feature that guides the vehicle to a tow hookup on a trailer without the headache of perfecting the geometry.\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 9\nIn terms of electric SUVs, the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 9 stands near the front of the pack.\n\"Hyundai\u2019s 2025 Ioniq 5 gets just about everything right,\" Phelan wrote, emphasizing that the latest model year for the vehicle implemented some significant changes that lifted the vehicle from everyday commuter to a smart, convenient choice for a prospective SUV buyer.\nThe Ioniq 5 is the first non-Tesla vehicle to come equipped with a NACS charging port, making it possible to charge the battery on Tesla\u2019s widespread DC fast-charging network, which is prominent across the U.S. For most other electric vehicles, an adapter is required to charge at a Tesla charging station.\nWith the right options, there is an Ioniq 5 for everyone. Along with the standard Ioniq 5, which begins at $44,220, Hyundai offers a capable off-road-focused XRT option for $57,100.\n2025 Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid\nThe Grand Highlander Hybrid has it all: great fuel economy, three rows of seating, plenty of cabin and storage space, luxurious touches and a good bang for your buck.\nSome of the appeal for this vehicle comes from the badge and powertrain. Toyota pioneered the hybrid segment with the popular Prius, and has continued to innovate hybrid powertrains. Along with a capable and efficient hybrid engine, the Grand Highlander comes equipped with luxurious features and lots of space for a bargain price.\nStarting at $44,210 \u2014 several thousand dollars below the average price of a new car in the U.S. \u2014 the Grand Highlander is a great choice for families and anyone else seeking a roomy, efficient SUV.\n2025 Toyota Land Cruiser\nThe Grand Highlander is not the only hybrid Toyota SUV generating acclaim. We couldn't get enough of the hybrid Toyota Land Cruiser, either.\nDetroit Free Press auto critic Mark Phelan took the car for two spins, returning after his second drive and asking, \"Is it still love, or love at second sight?\"\nPhelan wrote that the Land Cruiser, while expensive, is a triumph of comfort and off-road capability. With a two-tone paint scheme and boxy, classic exterior, the vehicle harkens back to Toyota's older Land Cruiser while delivering on the high-tech amenities of the modern day.\nWith 326 horsepower and 465 pound-feet of torque, the hybrid delivers the power necessary for both off-roading and highway cruising. The biggest detriment? The engine requires premium fuel, adding some extra costs that hybrid powertrains typically save with high fuel efficiency."
