  "description": "The Detroit Tigers have some big decisions to make in the coming months and one MLB writer believes they could cut ties with a young prospect in a trade.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers took a bit of a conservative approach at the trade deadline, opting to add to their roster, but not in a huge way.\n\nAs a result, they held onto a lot of their young players. Still, they could look to make a few big moves in the coming months involving some of their young players, especially if they have top prospects coming to replace them.\n\nColin Keane of Motor City Bengals recently suggested the Tigers could cut ties with young infielder Trey Sweeney in the offseason after holding onto him at the trade deadline.\n\n\"Sweeney made his MLB debut last season for the Tigers and ended up playing 36 games, finishing the year with a .218 batting average to go along with four home runs and 17 RBI,\" Keane wrote. \"This season, Sweeney is slashing .208/.275/.303 with five home runs and 27 RBI in 231 at-bats (entering Wednesday). Detroit's farm system is loaded with high-end talent in the infield, with studs like Hao-Yu Lee knocking on the door and the franchise's No. 1 prospect, Kevin McGonigle, soon to follow.\n\n\"In other words, the Tigers will soon have multiple in-house upgrades to Sweeney. That doesn't mean Sweeney's trade value in the eyes of other clubs is dead, though. He's still just 25 years old and was a first-round pick for a reason. There's still time for Sweeney to unlock things in the batter's box, and there are teams out there who will think they can provide the key.\"\n\nSweeney was acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Jack Flaherty trade last season. He hasn't given the Tigers much, but he's played a role for the time being.\n\nNow, Detroit will have some top prospects cracking into the big leagues next season and they could take Sweeney's place.\n\nEven if the top prospects aren't ready, the Tigers will need to upgrade from the infielder. He's not showing enough promise to be a starter on a World Series contender.\n\nMore MLB: Yankees Southpaw Suggested As Roster Casualty Before Season 'Unravels Him'",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe New York Yankees are desperately searching for a way out of this losing stretch they've fallen into.\nOn the bright side for the Yankees, they should be getting some reinforcements back from the injured list in the near future, though this could create a bit of a roster crunch when the time comes.\nStephen Parello of Yanks Go Yard recently suggested reliever Brent Headrick could be at risk of being \"thrown off the roster\" down the stretch, specifically when Ryan Yarbrough returns from injury.\n\"Brent Headrick could be yet another casualty as the bullpen cavalry returns from the IL,\" Parello wrote. \"The southpaw has been mostly good in mop-up duty, with a 32.1% K-rate, 5.1% walk rate, and 3.60 ERA; however, if there's one bugaboo, it's that when he gets hit, the ball travels a long way, as evidenced by his 1.80 HR/9 on the year.\n\"The problem for Headrick is that Ryan Yarbrough is working towards a return and is the superior option to serve as an innings eater out of the pen. While he's filled in admirably in the opportunities he's gotten, it's only a matter of time until his home run problem unravels him. To that end, the former Minnesota Twin likely gets forced out, and hopefully that happens before he can serve up a back-breaking dinger.\"\nHeadrick hasn't been bad. In fact, his production has been good, and he has some of the filthier stuff on the Yankees' roster. When Yarbrough returns, it's likely going to be Headrick or Yerry De los Santos who is optioned to Triple-A.\nIf the Yankees want to carry three lefties in their bullpen, Headrick is safe on the roster, but if they only want to carry two, Yarbrough will replace the 27-year-old southpaw in the Bronx.\nMore MLB: Aaron Judge Addresses Yankees' Struggles After Another Crushing Loss\nAbout the writer\nZach Pressnell is a Newsweek contributor based in Columbus, Ohio.

      "text": "The Detroit Tigers focused on pitching at the 2025 trade deadline, acquiring arms like Charlie Morton, Chris Paddack, Kyle Finnegan and Paul Sewald to strengthen their staff.\nWhile they avoided major roster shakeups, some players who survived the deadline may not be in Detroit for much longer. Armed with a deep farm system, the Tigers will likely cut ties with a few names in the offseason to clear space for younger talent. And we think we have an idea who that might be when the time eventually comes.\nThese 3 Tigers survived the trade deadline, but will be gone by the offseason (if not sooner)\nTrey Sweeney\nFormerly the No. 20 overall selection in the 2021 MLB Draft by the New York Yankees, Trey Sweeney hasn\u2019t been able to figure things out at the plate yet with Detroit. Sweeney made his MLB debut last season for the Tigers and ended up playing 36 games, finishing the year with a .218 batting average to go along with four home runs and 17 RBI. This season, Sweeney is slashing .208/.275/.303 with five home runs and 27 RBI in 231 at-bats (entering Wednesday).\nDetroit\u2019s farm system is loaded with high-end talent in the infield, with studs like Hao-Yu Lee knocking on the door and the franchise\u2019s No. 1 prospect, Kevin McGonigle, soon to follow. In other words, the Tigers will soon have multiple in-house upgrades to Sweeney. That doesn\u2019t mean Sweeney\u2019s trade value in the eyes of other clubs is dead, though. He\u2019s still just 25 years old and was a first-round pick for a reason. There\u2019s still time for Sweeney to unlock things in the batter\u2019s box, and there are teams out there who will think they can provide the key.\nJace Jung\nLike Sweeney, Jace Jung is a former first-round pick who hasn\u2019t yet broken through as a consistent big league contributor, particularly at the plate. Detroit selected Jung with the No. 12 overall pick in the 2021 MLB Draft. His MLB sample size isn\u2019t large (124 at-bats), but his production in limited opportunities hasn\u2019t warranted more of them. Jung has a career .554 OPS and is 5-for-45 at the plate so far in 2025 for the Tigers. He\u2019s been attempting to revamp his swing in the minors this summer.\nWith the 2025 Tigers obviously in win-now mode, Jung\u2019s development isn\u2019t a huge priority, and he\u2019s in danger of being usurped in the organization\u2019s pecking order by younger, rising prospects like McGonigle, Lee, and Bryce Rainer. Jung is in a similar situation to Sweeney, but he\u2019s even younger at 24. Detroit will have suitors interested if and when they put Jung up for sale in the offseason. A change of scenery could be best for everyone involved.\nRyan Kreidler\nIf the Tigers don\u2019t have reason to keep Sweeney and Jung around, they certainly don\u2019t have room for Ryan Kreidler. His defensive versatility is useful and may attract other clubs as a low-cost option, but his career .384 OPS in 188 at-bats leaves a ton to be desired.\nKreidler is relatively young at 27 years old, but again, Detroit simply has too many young infielders surging up the prospect rankings to ignore. Moving on from Kreidler seems like an obvious outcome for the Tigers this offseason, either via trade or DFA."

  "argos_summary": "The Detroit Tigers took a conservative approach at the trade deadline, opting to retain many young players while adding some pitching depth. However, with a strong farm system and top prospects like Hao-Yu Lee and Kevin McGonigle ready to join the majors, players like Trey Sweeney, Jace Jung, and Ryan Kreidler may be at risk of being traded or released in the offseason due to their underwhelming performances. Despite their struggles, Sweeney and Jung still hold potential trade value as former first-round picks.",
