  "title": "7 ways the Honor Magic V5 totally outshines Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7",
  "description": "Honor's latest book-style phone is a true contender for best-in-class foldability - on the hardware front, it gives Samsung a run for its money.",
  "content": "As far as book-style foldable phones go, Honor's Magic V5 and Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 are among the current cream of the crop. With both having been released in a global capacity in proximity to one another, one-for-one product comparisons are an inevitability.\n\nThe V5 and the Z Fold 7 share a lot of commonalities, including roughly identical footprints and thicknesses, similar amounts of computational horsepower, and analogous suites of multitasking features within their respective software packages.\n\nHowever, the two devices also diverge in a number of other areas, particularly with respect to hardware. Despite not being available for purchase directly within the United States, Honor's Magic V5 is arguably the more impressive foldable package on the whole.\n\nHere are seven ways in which the V5 outshines its Galaxy-branded rival, while also managing to undercut Samsung when it comes to pricing within certain markets.\n\u2022 The Honor Magic V5 is a flagship book-style foldable phone with a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a 5,820mAh battery, and a 4.1mm thickness when unfolded.\n\u2022 Samsung's next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest and lightest foldable yet, with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and IP48 water and dust resistance.\n\nWith the Magic V5, Honor is embracing a relatively new technology that makes use of silicon-carbon battery chemistry as opposed to a more traditional lithium-ion one. The addition of silicon-carbon allows for more densely packed energy, which equates to more mAh capacity within a smaller physical battery cell.\n\nThe result of this is that even though both foldables are roughly identical in terms of thickness, the V5 ships with a massive 5,820mAh battery capacity in comparison to the Galaxy Z Fold 7's 4,400mAh capacity. Of course, battery life is a subjective measurement that fluctuates based on the user's power load, and the verdict is still out whether the V5 genuinely outlasts the Z Fold 7 in the real world.\n\nOver the past couple of years, we've seen phone makers make significant strides when it comes to the ingress protection ratings of their foldable devices. Most recently, Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold set a new bar with its IP68 water and dust resistance metric (immersible up to 4.92 feet (1.5m) for 30 minutes, and entirely sealed from dust).\n\nAs for the Magic V5, Honor has achieved both IP58 and IP59 certifications, which equates to protection for being submerged in up to 3.28 feet (1 meter) of fresh water for 30 minutes, in addition to protection against high-pressure water jets and 'limited dust ingress.' By contrast, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is IP48 rated -- meaning it can be submerged in up to 4.92 feet (1.5m) for 30 minutes, but that it isn't impervious to dust particles smaller than 0.04 inches (1mm) in size.\n\nHonor takes eye comfort to a whole new level\n\nWith how much of our days we spend staring at displays, eye comfort technologies are becoming ever-more appreciated and recognized. Honor has been at the top of its game for some time now when it comes to its suite of display settings intended to reduce eye fatigue, including with Defocus Eyecare, Circadian Night Display, and Natural Tone modes. Thankfully, with the Magic V5, Honor maintains this commitment to eye strain relief.\n\nMost notably, the V5's inner panel features a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of 4,320Hz, which should result in less headaches and eye discomfort for those who are sensitive to displays with lower PWMs. PWM can be roughly described as a sort of flicker that takes place to influence the perceived brightness of a display panel, and the effect is most pronounced on OLED-style screens when at lower brightness levels. By contrast, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 features a far less impressive PWM rate of 460Hz, making it an objectively less eye-friendly digital canvas to interact with on the daily.\n\nConsidering Samsung's explosive history when it comes to smartphone batteries and their thermal management, it's no surprise that the company takes a conservative approach to charging speeds of both the wired and wireless variety. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is capable of 25W of wired and 15W of wireless charging, which is roughly in line with the likes of Apple and Google, but far below the speeds we've seen on most contemporary phones from Chinese OEMs.\n\nPredictably, Honor's V5 has stepped onto the foldable scene with guns blazing, supporting up to 66W of wired and 50W of wireless charging. Of course, you'll need compatible (and sold separately) Honor SuperCharge power bricks and inductive charging pads to unlock these speedy top-ups, and they rely on proprietary technology as opposed to the universal Power Delivery (PD) outlined by the USB Implementors Forum. In other words, you win some, you lose some.\n\nOne company ditches inking while the other embraces it\n\nIn its quest to slim down the frame of its next-generation book-style flagship, Samsung opted to nix support for its S Pen digital stylus altogether. The additional digitizer hardware needed below the display takes up precious internal space, though Kang Min-seok, executive director of Samsung\u2019s MX business division, has confirmed in a statement to ETNews that the company is looking into ways to slim down the technology for potential re-introduction in a future Z Fold.\n\nWith its Magic V5, Honor has managed to retain support for digital inking via its Magic Pen, seemingly without compromising on unit thinness. I can't speak to the in-hand feel or inking quality of either company's stylus, as I haven't used either in person, but the V5's support for the feature is an added bonus that Galaxy Z Fold 7 users simply won't have access to this time around.\n\nMore pixels to work with when zooming in on subjects\n\nBoth the Honor Magic V5 and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 ship with impressive triple rear camera setups, complete with wide angle, ultra-wide angle, and telephoto zoom sensors for flexible access to various focal lengths. Where the V5 has a leg up over the Z Fold 7 is in terms of its optical zoom capability.\n\nTo start off, the V5's zoom lens uses a much higher resolution 64-megapixel sensor than the Galaxy Z Fold 7's 10-megapixel lens. Megapixels aren't everything, of course, but the added resolution is a great perk when it comes to punching in on subjects from a distance. Both devices are capable of up to 3x optical zoom performance, but the V5's f2.5 aperture lets in slightly more light than the Z Fold 7's f/2.4 equivalent.\n\nThe less inner display reflectivity, the better\n\nLast but not least, the Honor Magic V5 bests the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in the anti-reflective department. As with every other foldable on the market, both devices feature glossy, highly glare-prone inner displays, though Honor's anti-reflective coating is a slight step above that of Samsung's implementation. Neither is foolproof, and if you live in a particularly sunny part of the world then outdoor visibility will prove a challenge, but the V5's peak brightness of 5,000 nits might just swoop in to save the day versus the Z Fold 7's 2,600 nits at peak.",

      "text": "Cameras are complex instruments with complicated components that work in concert to create an image. Even though these components (and their specifications) play a critical role in determining the ultimate quality of an image, the only tech spec that gets any lip service in marketing literature is the megapixel count.\nBut is that enough to make an informed decision when purchasing a smartphone? Are megapixels the final word when it comes to smartphone photography? And what's the best Android phone for smartphone lovers?\nIs megapixel count the only relevant metric for smartphone cameras?\nThe megapixel count isn't the sole factor you should consider when shopping for a phone. Although megapixel counts are important, other variables affect image quality. The hardware, software, and your preferences play a part in the perception of how good a picture is. To understand why the megapixel count isn't the ultimate arbiter of camera quality, it helps to know how smartphone cameras work, what each part does, and how their performance is quantified.\nLight is the most critical thing cameras need to produce a picture. Professional cameras can control how much light they receive by adjusting the aperture (the opening between the internal workings of the camera and the outside world). Smartphones mostly don't have that luxury.\nSamsung released some flagship phones a few years ago with variable aperture. However, aside from Huawei's Mate 50, phone manufacturers don't want to use the space or spend the money to put the feature in their phones. Besides, photo processing can achieve most of the optical effects produced with a variable aperture, so there isn't much need until the tech progresses.\nSince a variable aperture is mostly out of the question (for now) and because everything about mobile cameras is miniaturized, as much light as possible needs to reach the sensor. Therefore, you want the largest aperture possible. Aperture is measured in f-stops. The smaller the number, the larger the opening.\nAnother important consideration is the focal length of the camera. To understand focal length, you must understand the basics of a traditional camera. Light passes through the camera lens, where it is focused to a point before being projected onto film or a sensor. In this setup, the focal length is the distance between the camera's sensor/film and where the light is converged. The lower the focal length (measured in mm), the wider the angle of view. The higher the focal length, the narrower the view and the greater the magnification.\nThe focal length of a smartphone camera is around 4mm, but that number is meaningless from a photographic point of view. Instead, the focal length of smartphones is given in 35mm equivalent. What focal length would you need on a full-frame camera to achieve the same angle of view? A higher or lower number isn't necessarily better or worse, but most smartphones have at least one camera with a wide angle and a short focal length because most people want to capture as broad a scene as possible with their photos.\nThe lens is fundamental to the camera's focal length. The lens comprises multiple lenses (called elements) and the lens protector. The job of the lens is to bend and focus the light onto the image sensor. The problem with light is that it doesn't bend a fixed amount. Red light and blue light bend differently.\nSmartphone makers use multiple elements and software to compensate for these aberrations and distortions. No lens allows for the perfect transmission of light, so there's always a little loss. The drawback to having more lenses is having less light on the sensor. Where does this light go? It's reflected. These reflections can show up in your photos and videos as lens flare.\nThe physics behind distortion and reflection are complicated, which is likely why phone makers don't tend to publish information on their lenses with their other camera specs. You'll have to use the camera rather than rely on metrics to determine if it meets your standards. One way to test the lens quality of a phone camera is to look for a type of chromatic aberration called purple fringing. This is when the edges of high-contrast objects have a purplish haze. This effect can be easy to miss, so it's not a big deal for most people, but better lenses reduce or eliminate this effect.\nHow important is the camera sensor?\nThe camera sensor is a piece of hardware that converts raw optical data (light) into electrical information. The sensor's surface is covered with millions of individual photosites that create an electrical signal based on the intensity of light it receives.\nThe larger the individual photosite (measured in micrometers or \u03bcm), the better it captures light. It can reproduce a truer value, especially in low-light or dynamic-light situations. The trade-off to larger photosites is that fewer can fit on the image sensor, so having a larger sensor (measured in fractions of an inch) is important. A bigger sensor is almost always better.\nPhotosites only measure the intensity of light, not its color. To extract color data, image sensors cover each photosite with a color filter (typically a matrix of red, green, and blue). The arrangement of this color filter array is known by the image processor, which applies those colors to the luminance values of each photosite, then uses that information to produce a full-color image.\nMost phones use a Bayer color filter that's made up of 50% green, 25% red, and 25% blue filters (RGGB). The preponderance of green is because the human eye is better at seeing green than other colors. Some phones use a filter array that cuts those numbers in half: 25% green, 12.5% red, and 12.5% blue, with the remaining 50% reading unfiltered luminance values (RGBA). This arrangement is good for picking up extra luminance data but at the cost of color data.\nSome digital cameras experimented with cyan, magenta, and yellow (CYYM) instead of blue, red, and green because it lets more light into the photosites than RGB filters. This was abandoned because it was difficult for software to reconstruct an accurate image from CMY data.\nHuawei made a phone that used the traditional Bayer filter but replaced the green filter with a yellow filter (RYYB) to boost the light collection of its photosites. We liked the phone and its robust night shots, but a yellow tint sometimes showed up in the pictures.\nOne popular alternative to the Bayer filter is the Quad Bayer. It uses the same pattern as the RGGB filter, except each color covers four photosites instead of one. This arrangement is good for low-light photography and reduces image noise.\nComputational Photography\nThe final piece of the smartphone photography pipeline is the image processor. This is where the fundamental electrical data produced by the photosensor is transformed into a proper photo. Every OEM has its own pipeline for this process, but many of the steps are the same for all manufacturers.\n- Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC): Each photosite on a photosensor measures the intensity of light that strikes it as an analog value. The range of values it can register (how many shades of black and white) is known as its bit depth. The result of this step in the pipeline is a black-and-white image.\n-\nDemosaicing/Debayering: Once a rough black-and-white image has been produced, the image processor determines the pixel colors based on the arrangement of the CFA and the intensity of light registered by the corresponding and adjacent photosites. This produces a RAW image.\nFrom here, the steps taken by the image processor become more subjective and can vary significantly from one manufacturer to another. The steps below are in most image-processing pipelines.\n-\nColor balancing/White balancing: This is the process of adjusting the intensities of the colors in a shot. One of the goals of this process is to make sure neutral colors like white and gray appear correctly, neither too warm nor too cool. Color balancing can also change the mood of a shot, making it appear warmer, but if taken too far, it can color-shift the photo.\n-\nNoise reduction: All electronic signals are subject to interference (noise) which usually manifests as out-of-place, over-bright pixels. Photographs taken in low light are particularly susceptible to noise. Most image processors do their best to eliminate it. Some processes for noise elimination are better than others, and all of them sacrifice fidelity for a more pleasing image.\n-\nGamma correction: Your phone's image sensors do not see the world the same way as our eyes do. This is particularly true when it comes to luminance values. In particular, our eyes are very good at differentiating darker shades. This means that what our image sensor perceives as 50% light intensity appears to us as around 75% light intensity. Gamma correction adjusts the image's luminance values to align with how we perceive the world.\nOne of the greatest advantages phone cameras have over their professional DSLR counterparts is the electronic shutter. Whereas a DSLR relies on a slower mechanical shutter to control how much light its sensor is exposed to, phone sensors use electronic shutters, which allow dramatically shorter exposure times. This means our phones can take a burst of photos in a very short time, allowing for novel post-processing techniques.\n-\nMulti-exposure HDR: Exposure refers to how long the image sensor is exposed to the light of the scene. Shorter exposures better capture the brightest parts of an image while leaving the darker parts too dark to see detail. Longer exposures bring out darker details but blow out brighter details, drowning them in white. By taking multiple photos at different exposures and combining them, your phone can produce a photo with a greater range of light intensities.\n-\nMulti-frame noise reduction: One of the most common sources of noise in photos comes from shooting in low light. To compensate for the lack of photons, your phone increases its ISO sensitivity \u2014 how sensitive it is to light. The trade-off for capturing more light is a higher propensity for noise. The idea is similar to astrophotography image stacking. Multiple photos are taken at a higher ISO setting (lower light sensitivity), then combined to eliminate noise and progressively increase the exposure.\n-\nPortrait mode: Most phone cameras have a long, fixed depth of field, meaning that close objects are just as in focus as objects that are far away, but from an aesthetic perspective, that's not always what you want. Often, it's desirable to have a shallow depth of field where only the photo's subject is in focus and the background is blurry. To achieve this, some phones take more than one image (sometimes from different cameras) to get a rough idea of the distances of different parts of the photo to separate the background from the foreground and selectively apply a blur.\nEvery OEM has its process for applying these steps, and given the same RAW data, Samsung, Huawei, Pixel, and iPhone produce different images. No method is better than another from an objective point of view. Some people prefer the Pixel's HDR-heavy processing over the iPhone's more conservative and natural look.\nSo, do megapixels really matter?\nAbsolutely. We expect to capture a degree of authenticity when we take a photo. We generally want our photos to be as close to real as possible, and visible pixelation shatters the illusion. To preserve that illusion of reality, we need to approximate the resolution of the human eye, which, for someone with 20/20 vision, is about 720 pixels per inch as seen from one foot away.\nIf you want to print your photos in the standard 6-inch by 4-inch photo format, you need a resolution of 4,320 by 2,880 or 12,441,600 pixels, which is a bit under 12.5 megapixels.\nBut that raises the question: If 12 megapixels are near the limit of what the average human can see, why does the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra have 108MP? Phones like the S21 Ultra don't produce 12,728 by 8,485 images. Instead, they use pixel binning, where the phone's software combines the data from a square of adjacent photosites into a \"super pixel.\"\nThis kind of software magic is what phones with Quad Bayer sensors use to improve performance. Instead of using one photosite to collect color information, it uses a square of four photosites to double the size of the photosite at the cost of final image resolution. Why not just make larger photosites? You could, but binning smaller ones offers advantages that larger sensors can't match, such as better HDR images and zoom capabilities.\nDon't forget to save your photos\nNow that you're versed in smartphone camera components, it's time to think about storage. If you're a smartphone shutterbug, don't rely on a single method to save your photos. Google Photos can help you organize and save photos, but you'll want backups if you get locked out of your account. A good Synology NAS is another solid photo storage option, but it and your phone are suitable for archiving important memories, as digital storage methods often become unstable after 5 to 10 years.\nThe Library of Congress provides a good overview of how to archive your print and digital media. If you have special needs, most research universities have staff who are experts in digital media archiving that can point you in the right direction."

When compared head-on with Samsung's recently-released Galaxy Z Fold 7, the V5 offers a larger battery pack with Silicon-carbon tech, faster wired and wireless charging speeds, an ever-so-slightly thinner frame when closed, and more robust IP water and dust resistance certifications.\nHonor's push into Western markets is exciting -- competition drives down prices, and the cost of foldable phones remains one of the main hurdles standing in the way of their mainstream adoption. There's no word on whether the Magic V5 will land on North American shores, but I sure hope it does at some point. The Galaxy Z Fold 7, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and the OnePlus Open are all excellent phones in their own right, but I feel that the more cooks there are in the foldable kitchen, the better."

      "text": "Summary\n- Samsung's Note 7 was praised at launch but was discontinued following widespread battery issues.\n- The blame was placed on the large battery's compact design and issues with electrodes.\n- Despite the fiasco's financial impact, Galaxy Note fandom remained.\nBack in 2016, I gave Samsung's ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 a glowing review and called it the \"best large-sized phablet smartphone\" I had ever used.\nIt was a monumental leap over the Galaxy Note 5 (there wasn't a Galaxy Note 6) in terms of its overall design, power, and, at least at the time, water resistance. I'm sure there were likely other IP68 water-resistant handsets, but the Note 7 was the first I encountered, and it was truly game-changing. I have fond memories of covering the 5.7-inch \"phablet\" -- which seems small by today's smartphone standards -- in water droplets at a local beach to snap a few wet-looking photos for my review.\n4 things the Galaxy S25 Ultra needs to become 2025's best phone\nWith the official reveal of Samsung's 2025 flagship only a few days away, here are a few things I hope to see from this year's device.\nOverall, the Note 7 was a stellar phone that, looking back, was way ahead of its time. It felt like Android's answer to the iPhone and combined the best elements of Samsung's Galaxy S7 with the stylus-equipped Note 5. Sure, using the iris scanner to log into the device was far from a perfect experience, but it felt like something out of Mission Impossible at the time. Even its camera performance was well ahead of other Android devices thanks to its 12-megapixel rear-facing shooter with optical image stabilization.\nUnfortunately, the Galaxy Note 7's life was cut short following widespread, potentially dangerous battery issues. With the Galaxy S25's launch looming on the horizon, now is a great time to look back at one of the biggest blunders in Samsung's smartphone history.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 7\n- SoC\n- Exynos 8890 Octa\n- Display\n- 5.7in, 2560 x 1440 pixels, Super AMOLED\n- Storage\n- 64GB\n- Battery\n- 3500mAh\n- Operating System\n- Android 6.0.1 (Marshmellow)\n- Camera (Rear, Front)\n- 12MP rear; 5MP front\nAn explosive smartphone\nThe calamity of missteps surrounding the Galaxy Note 7's recall was something to behold\nI vaguely remember reports surrounding Note 7 issues trickling in very slowly. The phone was officially released in late August 2016, and just a few days later, reports started appearing on Reddit, with users posting images and videos of the smartphone overheating, smoking, and, in some cases, catching fire. Once the tech blogging world started covering the problem, a constant stream of stories about the issue, including an incident involving a six-year-old boy that was burned by the phone, were published. At one point ahead of Samsung's official recall of the Note 7, several airlines worldwide went so far as to outright ban the Galaxy Note 7 from planes.\nOn October 11th 2016, Samsung stopped selling the Note 7 worldwide, emphasizing that all owners should power down the device and stop using it.\nBy September 2nd, Samsung launched a voluntary global recall of the 2.5 million Note 7 devices sold so far, and offered to either refund or replace the devices. Then, on September 9th, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission got involved and urged owners to stop using the smartphone entirely. On September 15th, the commission issued a formal recall.\nIt sounds silly now, but I was reluctant to give my Note 7 review unit back and kept delaying returning my device (I really liked it that much, and I didn't experience any issues with it -- at least not yet). Samsung Canada eventually sent a representative to retrieve the smartphone from me (I still have the phone's box in my garage somewhere, though -- maybe it'll be a collector's item someday?)\nUnfortunately for Samsung, replacement Note 7 devices still suffered from the same issue, leading to a phone on a Southwest Airline flight smoking and the plane being evacuated. This resulted in US carriers no longer issuing Note 7 replacements, which was a big blow to Samsung. Finally, on October 11th, the company officially stopped selling the Note 7 worldwide, emphasizing that all owners should power down the device and stop using it. In some regions, Samsung even deactivated service on Note 7 devices to encourage owners to return the device.\nIn total, the Note 7 fiasco cost Samsung $5.3 billion over the course of 2017.\nI always assumed the Galaxy Note 7 would make a triumphant return at some point, but that never really happened. The closest thing we got was the Galaxy Note FE Fan Edition, which released in 2017 in specific regions, including South Korea. In total, the Note 7 fiasco cost Samsung $5.3 billion throughout 2017.\nHMD's Barbie phone sent a wave of nostalgia through me\nWith a hot pink coat of paint, HMD's Barbie phone is a throwback to the T9-era with a ton of novelty.\nWhat caused the battery issue?\nSamsung was initially reluctant to point to the source definitively\nMost assumed that the Galaxy Note 7's woes were somehow tied to a fault in its large 3,500 mAh battery, which was massive by 2016 smartphone standards. Several months after the mandatory recall, Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's then-mobile division president, placed the blame on its battery supplier (which was likely Samsung SDI), citing the cell's compact design, thin separators, and overall high energy density. Following the company's very lengthy investigation into the problem, Samsung determined there wasn't enough space in the Galaxy Note 7's battery area to accommodate its electrodes, leading to the overheating issues that plagued the device.\nNote 7 features and design cues can still be found in devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, including the S Pen.\nWhile the tech giant blamed its battery division, Samsung also admitted that it \"provided the target for the battery specifications for the innovative Note 7, and we are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing.\"\nSamsung recovered shockingly quickly from the controversy surrounding the Note 7's battery issues, with Galaxy Note 8 sales rebounding the next year in 2017. On a personal note, everyone I know who said they'd never purchase a Samsung device again after being frustrated with the Note 7 situation bought the next Galaxy S series device or Note smartphone. Samsung has a lot of hardcore fans who stand by the company, even through something as controversial as this.\nThe Galaxy Note line received several more releases, culminating in 2021's Galaxy Note 20, the final device in the stylus-focused line. However, Note features can still be found in devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, including the now iconic S Pen.\nIs RedNote really a TikTok alternative? I tried it to find out\nI downloaded the hit new app for \"TikTok refugees,\" but was it worth it?"

That tends to bring the potential for huge price tags, to get hold of a piece of this magic.\nHere are the devices leading the foldable smartphone trend.\nBest foldable phones: Our top tested picks\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5\nSamsung has set a new standard for clamshells\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\n- Display\n- 6.7-inch AMOLED, 2640 x 1080 pixel resolution, 120Hz (inner); 3.4-inch AMOLED, 748 x 720 pixel resolution (outer)\n- RAM\n- 8GB RAM\nSamsung's latest flip phone offers a stunning big cover screen, great cameras, and an improved, durable design plus all the flagship specs you'd hope for.\n- Big, bright and customisable cover screen\n- Waterproof and durable design\n- Long-time software and security patch support\n- Lots of different colour options\n- Great cameras\n- No zoom lens\n- Charging could be faster\nThere are a few things that stood out when we tested the Z Flip 5 from Samsung, which - yet again - means the Galaxy Flip remains our top recommendation for anyone looking for a modern foldable clamshell phone.\nPerformance is top-notch in every possible way, and we were blown away with how much life we managed to get from the battery, despite the fact that capacity hasn't increased at all. The more efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 inside helps, as well as ensuring that it feels really fast and responsive.\nThe aluminium frame feels sturdy, the cover display is big, bright and fun to interact with and the water-resistance rating means it's far more likely to survive accidental encounters with moisture than any other flip phone on the list. We still have concerns about how long the bending internal display might last the average user, but that's the same for any phone on this list.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 4 won't be the phone for everyone, and there are plenty of other models and styles to choose from, with more manufacturers joining the flexible smartphone market all the time and each with their benefits.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 5\nA refined design and performance\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\n- Display\n- 6.2-inch AMOLED, 2316 x 904, 120Hz (cover) / 7.6-inch AMOLED, 2176 x 1812, 120Hz (main)\n- RAM\n- 12GB\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is the latest folding phone from Samsung. It brings a refined design compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 4, along with some great internal upgrades.\n- Great display quality\n- Top tier power and performance\n- Folding design and mechanism is solid\n- High water resistance rating\n- Great software optimisations\n- External display is too narrow\n- Samsung bloatware onboard\nAs is standard practice for Samsung, it didn't just launch a new clamshell foldable, it also launched a horizontal book-style folding phone: the Galaxy Z Fold 5. In this market, it stands above the rest thanks to a considered approach to design and great software optimisation.\nIt's a bit of an iterative upgrade on the Z Fold 4, but the increased power and efficiency from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 are worthwhile inclusions, as is the improved hinge design which sees the screen fold completely shut, with no gap at the hinge.\nWe still think the outer display is a bit too cramped and narrow - especially when compared to the likes of the Pixel Fold and the Oppo Find N2 - but as a complete package, it's hard to think of a better all-rounder.\nOnePlus Open\nA slim, pocket-able book-style foldable\n- Brand\n- OnePlus\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\n- Display\n- 6.2-inch AMOLED, 2484 x 1116, 120Hz (cover) / 7.82-inch AMOLED, 2440 x 2268, 120Hz (main)\n- RAM\n- 16GB\n- Storage\n- 512GB\nWith its really versatile multi-tasking software, brilliant displays, fast-charging and excellent battery life, the OnePlus has taken on the role of main competitor to the Z Fold 5. It's a brilliant all-rounder.\n- Quality external and internal displays\n- Great battery life with fast charging\n- Clean software with innovative multitasking\n- Excellent camera versatility\n- Solid and slim design\n- It's not cheap\n- Water resistance isn't the highest\n- No wireless charging\nThe first foldable phone under the OnePlus brand has really knocked it out of the park in a lot of ways. The design is premium and slim and features a gap-less hinge that closes completely, but does so in a way that leaves very little in the way of a discernible crease on the display.\nThat display on the inside - along with the big cover display - are among the brightest, most vibrant AMOLED panels put on a foldable phone to date, reaching peaks up to 2600 nits. They're also both very sharp, with over 400 pixels-per-inch and reach refresh rates up to 120Hz, with the ability to drop to really low rates when necessary.\nWhat really makes the OnePlus Open stand out - however - is the approach to multitasking. Rather than limit you to just the space on the screen, you can have apps running off to the side, effectively giving you a virtual canvas that expands and is flexible, based on how you want to use it.\nAdd a great, big battery that lasts well, flagship performance, fast charging speeds, and a versatile camera system, and you have a truly great foldable. It could do with wireless charging and better water/dust resistant, but it's a great device overall.\nMotorola Razr 40 Ultra\n(Also known as Razr+ in the US)\n- SoC\n- Sanpdragon 8+ Gen 1\n- Display\n- 6.9-inch inner, 3.6-inch outer\n- RAM\n- 8GB / 12GB LPDDR5\n- Storage\n- 256GB / 512GB UFS 3.1\nMotorola's latest Razr - known as the Razr+ in North America - has a big outer screen that's really useful, plus speedy performance, great battery and it's a sensible price.\n- Big cover screen is really useful\n- Clean, bloat-free software\n- Great battery life\n- Only IP52 water resistant\n- Software could be better optimised for folding screen\nWe were really torn between the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the Moto Razr 40 Ultra (Razr+) in first place, both have strengths, but in the end Samsung pipped it for its better software optimisation and better cameras in testing. With that said, we still like the latest flagship Motorola - a lot. The clean, bloat-free software is a breath of fresh air, and it has the flagship power and performance you'd want from a top-tier phone. What's more - for a clamshell foldable - the battery life is very good, comfortably lasting a full day even with a lot of screen usage.\nThe big draw is the large cover screen on the outside. It's great for taking selfies and surprisingly convenient for reading (and replying to) messages on the fly, meaning you don't have to open the phone for every interaction like you do with the regular Razr 40.\nGoogle Pixel Fold\nGoogle continues to dominate the smartphone camera market\n- Brand\n- SoC\n- Google Tensor G2\n- Display\n- 5.8-inch, OLED, 2092 x 1080, 120Hz (cover) / 6.7-inch OLED, UTG, 2208 x 1840, 120Hz (main)\n- Battery\n- 4821mAh, 30W fast charging, Wireless charging\n- Operating System\n- Android\nThe Pixel Fold takes Google's phones in a new direction, embracing the next-gen screen tech and presenting a premium PIxel option. It's a great quality phone, but it's clear there's still work to be done on app optimisation to enhance the experience.\n- Great camera results\n- External display is very usable\n- Design is very premium, durable\n- It's expensive\n- Still waiting on some software optimisation\n- Middling battery life\nDespite owning the Android platform, it took a little while for Google to finally launch its own foldable. And when it did, it took a completely different approach to most other manufacturers. In a similar move to the Find N2, Google opted for a book-style foldable that was relatively short, but wide. It's very different to the long, narrow Z Fold 4 from Samsung. That does mean you get a big, usable screen on the outside though, and in our testing, it quickly became the one thing that set it apart from the others. We'd use it just as often - if not more so - than the internal display, because there really is no compromise. It's not cramped, it's easy to type on and even works for video and games.\nThe Pixel Fold also has a similar camera set-up to the Pixel 7 Pro, which is to say, that - as a system - the Pixel has the best cameras of any foldable on the market. It snaps shots easily, is quick and delivers sharp, colourful results in any condition, even nighttime. Its only real issue - apart from the fact it doesn't open completely flat - is that software optimisation isn't quite where it should be for the wide internal display. There's very much a sense that the UI experience is a bit rough around the edges.\nOppo Find N2 Flip\nKing of the flips\nThe Oppo Find N2 Flip gets a lot right, offering an interesting vertical cover display, a big, bright internal display and 44W fast charging in a neat, pocketable package that doesn't cost the earth.\n- Big vertical display on the cover\n- Main display crease is almost invisible\n- Gapless design when shut\n- Flagship power from Mediatek\n- Cover display functionality is limited\n- Ultrawide camera could be a lot better\n- No IP rated water resistance\nIt's safe to say Oppo thought about things very differently from its competitors with the Find N2 Flip. Yes, you still get a portable, foldable clamshell that slips easily into a pocket, but you also get an unusual vertical display on the front which makes a lot of sense in specific scenarios. It's essentially a mini smartphone display and is great for lists, message inboxes and recording vertical videos.\nMarry that with a phone that has a brilliant internal display, an almost invisible crease in the display and a gapless design, and it's a really tempting offering, especially at this price point. As an extra kicker - you get 44W wired charging - delivering a full charge in about an hour.\nHonor Magic Vs\nA no compromise folding phone\nHonor's foldable flagship has powerful internals and two big, vibrant displays. It folds flush too, offering a very different experience to the Galaxy Z Fold.\n- Big front screen\n- Powerful flagship specs\n- Big internal display that folds flush\n- Fast charging\n- No wireless charging\n- Slight crease on the internal display\n- It's a big phone\nHonor's flagship foldable takes a similar approach to its former parent company, Huawei's. It's a really big device with a large flexible display on the inside and a full-sized screen on the outside. You get lots of screen real estate then, and both displays offer a great visual experience. It folds flush, which is a big draw, and has some impressive specifications. The Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 runs the show, and Honor's Android skin comes with all the proper Play Store compatibility. It's a great option for those who want a big screened foldable.\nHuawei Mate X3\nSublime hardware and cameras\nHuawei's flagship folding phone has incredible cameras and stunning hardware design. If it was based on hardware alone, it'd be our top recommendation.\n- Stunning design - it's unbelievably slim\n- Really good displays\n- Probably the best cameras on any foldable\n- No Google Play services\n- It's really expensive\nLet's get the two major elephants out of the room first: yes, it's expensive and no, it doesn't have Google Play Services. But there's many a reason we think the Mate X3 deserves a mention, even if it's just an honourable mention at the end of a list. The hardware design is - without doubt - the nicest we've laid our hands on. The slimness seems almost impossible and - combined with the fake leather back - make it really comfortable to hold. It's also got a wonderful pair of screens and - probably - the best camera of any foldable phone.\nLacking Google Play isn't the hurdle it used to be. Apps that aren't on the Huawei's App Gallery are available to download as APKs through Petal Search which now also informs you when there are updates available to download, so that process feels more user-friendly than it was. What's more, there's a suite of Microsoft apps, including Outlook and Edge, available in place of Gmail and Chrome. There are still some hurdles, and some apps you'll struggle to get hold of, so you still need to look into that to see if you're missing anything crucial.\nUnlike standard smartphones, however, missing apps isn't the major inconvenience it could be. Plenty of services are available as web services, and accessible through the browser, and that method can be beneficial on the almost tablet-sized display on the inside.\nThe bottom line: What is the best foldable phone to buy?\nFrom our hands-on testing experience, our choice for best foldable phone overall is Samsung's newest clamshell handset - the Galaxy Z Flip 5. The phone neatly folds into a compact pocket companion, yet reveals two beautiful AMOLED screens when in full-screen use. Plus, the cameras provide stunning clear visuals and there's plenty of fun colours to make the phone feel like a more custom fit.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5\n- Brand\n- Samsung\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\n- Display\n- 6.7-inch AMOLED, 2640 x 1080 pixel resolution, 120Hz (inner); 3.4-inch AMOLED, 748 x 720 pixel resolution (outer)\n- RAM\n- 8GB RAM\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB\nSamsung's latest flip phone offers a stunning big cover screen, great cameras, and an improved, durable design plus all the flagship specs you'd hope for.\nWhat's the cheapest folding phone?\nAt only $700, the latest Motorola Razr (2023 model) is the cheapest foldable we've reviewed - and that's on the market right now.\nWhy are foldable phones so expensive?\nThere are a lot of reasons that foldable phones are more expensive, but a main reason is due to their complex build as opposed to the standard candybar phone build. Having a hinge that opens and shuts means more parts to factor in to the manufacturing and build process.\nWith the large book-style foldables, they cost more because of that, and because there are two big displays: one on the outside and one on the inside, and the display is one of the more expensive components of a smartphone. So if you have one that's much larger than a regular smartphone and another normal smartphone-sized display as well, that's a lot more expense in the manufacturing process, which obviously then gets passed on to the consumer."

Here's the catch\nMarch 19, 2025\nBattery life; we can never have enough of it. Even though most smartphones from the past few years will easily take you through a day of use and possibly even two, the oldies among us still pine for those good old days when a single charge was enough to take your feature phone through a busy week.\nThankfully, battery engineers are on the case, and many of today\u2019s best flagship smartphones are now shipping with new silicon carbon batteries. This allows them to boast even larger battery capacities without a thicker or larger chassis. Talk about a major win.\nFor example, the OnePlus 13 packs a 6,000mAh silicon-carbon battery, allowing for an increase on last year\u2019s 5,400mAh cell. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra also boasts a colossal 6,000mAh battery capacity in China, up from 5,400mAh in the previous year (and a still decent 5,400mAh for global markets, up from 5,000mAh), and the smaller models benefit from similar gains, too. The HONOR Magic 7 Pro, OPPO Find X8, and the vivo X200 series are equally new flagship models boasting silicon in their power cells. The technology is already here in earnest.\nUnfortunately, we haven\u2019t seen Apple, Google, or Samsung adopt silicon-carbon battery technology into their latest products just yet. Perhaps we\u2019ll see these brands leap onboard closer to 2026. Still, should you rush out to buy a phone with a silicon carbon battery, or should you stick with the more familiar Lithium-ion models we know and love?\nSilicon carbon VS Li-ion batteries: What\u2019s the difference?\nToday\u2019s new silicon-carbon (Si/C) Li-Ion batteries are actually an evolution of traditional lithium-ion technology rather than an entirely new concept. They modify the conventional graphite anode by infusing it with silicon, which can store much more energy \u2014 theoretically up to 10x more than graphite (372 mAh/g versus ~4200 mAh/g for pure silicon). This has long made silicon an exciting material for boosting battery capacity.\nHowever, pure silicon anodes have significant challenges. The most problematic is extreme expansion, with the structure swelling by up to 300% when fully charged. This puts severe mechanical stress on the battery, reducing lifespan and causing structural failure. Additionally, silicon reacts aggressively with the electrolyte, breaking and reforming the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer with each cycle, leading to lithium loss and reduced capacity over time. This is made all the worse by aggressive expansion. Silicon also has lower electrical conductivity than graphite, which can slow charge and discharge rates and increase losses due to internal resistance, which can result in more heat, another no-no for battery longevity.\nSilicon batteries sound impressive but don't last long. Silicon-carbon helps tame the drawbacks.\nA silicon-carbon (Si/C) composite is used instead of pure silicon to solve these issues. Carbon provides structural support, helping to mitigate expansion and stabilize the SEI layer. While traditional graphite anodes expand by only ~10% during charge cycles, a well-engineered Si/C battery may limit swelling to just 10-20%, depending on its silicon content. Carbon also improves electrical conductivity, ensuring better lithium-ion flow for improved efficiency.\nThe trade-off is that Si/C anodes don\u2019t achieve pure silicon\u2019s full 10x capacity boost. Instead, they offer a more modest 10-20% increase in energy density, depending on silicon content. Higher Si content provides greater capacity but also increases swelling and manufacturing complexity, making Si/C batteries an engineering challenge. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch \u2014 Si/C batteries undoubtedly improve performance but with some limits and trade-offs.\nThe pros (and cons) of silicon carbon batteries\nOf course, any boost to smartphone battery capacity is a welcome one, and Si/C batteries are a boon for power users looking for smartphones that can withstand far more than a single day of heavy use. It\u2019s no surprise that we\u2019ve seen the technology arrive in so many of the most powerful flagship phones on the market this year.\nI\u2019ve been using the OPPO Find X8 Pro as a daily driver for over a month now and can attest to just how long-lasting its 5,910mAh Si/C Li-ion battery really is. I regularly make it through two days of moderate use on a single charge, have plenty left in the tank after a day out capturing the little ones, and lighter weeks have sometimes made it well beyond 48 hours before reaching for a charger.\nEqually, however, Si/C is good news for thinner devices, such as foldable and lightweight phones. While the Galaxy S25 Edge might not debut Si/C for Samsung, thin or compact smartphones could undoubtedly benefit from this new battery type to retain reasonable capacities in more restrictive form factors. The vivo X Fold 3 Pro has already used the technology to pack a substantial 5,700mAh battery into a 5.2mm folding design. Samsung\u2019s Z Fold 6 is 5.6mm thick yet only has a 4,400mA conventional battery. The most recent Chinese clamshell phones have leaped on this trend for larger capacities, too.\nIf there's a trade-off, silicon is a hop-forward for capacity but a step back for longevity.\nThe big question hanging over silicon-carbon batteries is whether they\u2019ll last as long as their more traditional lithium counterparts. With the trade-offs outlined above, it\u2019s clear that Si/C won\u2019t last as long as the most durable graphite-based Li-ion cells on the market today. However, lower levels of silicon content can still result in slightly higher-capacity batteries that will still last a similar length of time to traditional Li-ion cells. This looks like what we\u2019re seeing in today\u2019s most cutting-edge smartphones, with only a moderate but still very welcome boost in capacity to keep the silicon content in check.\nAs a result, smartphone brands may also be becoming more conservative with fast-charging temperatures to extend battery lifespans, especially as Si/C batteries push the boundaries of energy density and charge rates. That or brands are simply trying to ensure their phones can last as long as their recently improved five-plus years of promised updates. That said, Si/C is actually a boon for faster charging due to its improved capacity, higher lithium diffusivity, and lower risk of plating the anode. Not to mention that larger capacities make it more feasible to stick to the rule of 80% charge without the risk of running out of juice part way through your day. Silicon need not be bad news for keeping your handset for many years to come.\nShould you buy a phone with a silicon-carbon battery?\nSi/C Li-ion batteries are clearly great news for the latest smartphones and will almost certainly improve the battery life of your wearables, tablets, laptops, and even electric vehicles. Silicon cells are already a key part of today\u2019s most innovative handsets, enabling even larger capacities or thinner form factors without compromising on battery life.\nCurrently, however, you\u2019ll have to shop around at brands from China to get a hold of one, such as the very impressive OnePlus 13. US mainstays Apple, Google, and Samsung are yet to leap on board with this new battery technology. They might not even get to it this year, leaving us waiting until their 2026 flagships or perhaps even longer before they join the party.\nSilicon batteries are here, but there's no rush to go out and buy one.\nStill, it might be best to wait and see how the longevity issue plays out if you\u2019re planning to keep your smartphone for more than five years. While battery replacements are pretty much inevitable with any long-term purchase, Si/C Li-ion cells could need replacing more regularly, especially when paired with fast charging. Given that they are more expensive to produce, this could end up being an unwelcome added cost for early adopters. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nLikewise, it\u2019s not necessarily worth springing for a phone just because it has a Si/C Li-ion battery, especially if you\u2019re on a tighter budget. Owing to its tricker manufacturing process, the technology is mainly reserved for flagship smartphones and novel form factors, and it might take several years before we see it trickle down to the mid-range segment. While there are battery benefits to be had with silicon carbon, a 12% larger capacity is not necessarily worth spending $100s extra on.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Summary\n- Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite offers faster performance and better battery life than previous chips.\n- The chip features improved AI capabilities, leading to enhanced features in flagship smartphones.\n- Expect the Snapdragon 8 Elite in smartphones like Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePlus 13.\nLike clockwork, Qualcomm is back with a new high-end smartphone chip that's likely to be featured in nearly every top-tier Android device released this year.\nFirst off, the Snapdragon 8 Elite features the chipmaker's Oryon CPU, technology that first appeared in its X Elite laptop chips last year (though this is a 2nd generation version of that chip). Other key information includes the chip's 3nm build, which is a notable step up from last year's 4nm technology.\nThis allows the 4.32GHz Snapdragon 8 Elite to deliver 45 percent faster single and multi-core performance, while using 27 percent less power than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (this could result in 2.5 extra hours of gaming). Hopefully, this means Android devices that feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite will offer improved battery life over their predecessors. Qualcomm also says the chip features 40 percent more powerful gaming performance.\nFor more Snapdragon 8 Elite specs, click on the infographic above.\nNew leak gives us our first look at what could be the OnePlus 13\nLeaked images of what possibly could be the OnePlus 13 have appeared on Weibo and X.\nQualcomm goes big on AI\nJust like every tech company right now...\nAs you may have already guessed, Qualcomm is going big on the Snapdragon 8 Elite's AI capabilities by giving it a 45 percent faster NPU (neural processing unit). This means we'll likely see a lot of new AI features make their way to flagship smartphones from manufacturers like OnePlus, Asus, Oppo, and Xiaomi.\nThe Verge reports that the new NPU offers support for a new on-device AI-powered video object eraser tool that allows users to remove elements from video clips. It's unclear what smartphone will offer this futuristic-sounding tech first -- or how well it will work -- but my best guess is Samsung's Galaxy S25. This feature sounds a little too good to be true given how difficult it is to edit video with AI convincingly, but it will be interesting to see if Qualcomm can pull it off.\nIt's likely that we'll first see Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite in notable flagship smartphones like the Galaxy S25 Ultra (at least in North America) and possibly the OnePlus 13, which is expected to be revealed soon.\nWhat the cluck?

      "text": "While Samsung used to get praised for its phones, the tides have turned over the past few years as the brand continues to play it safe with upgrades that don't really move the needle. Samsung even issued a public apology last year, vowing to regain its edge and introduce products that are more exciting and innovative. With the announcement of the latest Galaxy S25 series, it doesn't look like much has changed, with many tech enthusiasts finding the lineup boring.\nBest Samsung Galaxy S25 series deals: Where to preorder every phone\nTake advantage of huge savings while you can\nAnd not even the top-end Galaxy S25 Ultra is cutting it. While most folks ordering the phone are still going to be interested in the new look, cameras, and processor \u2014 one of the more interesting points that's flying under a lot of radars is the new Corning Gorilla Armor 2 found in the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The screen found on the Galaxy S24 Ultra was already pretty good, but it looks like Corning has taken things to a new level with its latest Gorilla Armor 2 display technology.\nA small refinement that looks really good\nAccording to the brand, Gorilla Armor 2 features \"anti-reflective properties\" that \"dramatically reduce surface reflections in both indoor and outdoor ambient settings.\" Now it's kind of hard to really imagine this technology in the wild, but luckily we don't have to. As you can see from the video above shared by @tarunvats33 on X, the Galaxy S25 Ultra screen almost doesn't look real thanks to its new anti-reflective coating.\nIt's a little harder to notice, but we also get an image comparing the Galaxy S24 Ultra versus the Galaxy S25 Ultra from @theonecid on X. Now, from what we know, Samsung could hold this technology, only making it available to its own devices, just like it did last year with the original Gorilla Armor. While minor, this is just one of those features that you won't know you're missing out on unless you see it for yourself.\nLuckily, you can always buy similar results if you're willing to spend a little extra. In addition to the anti-reflective properties, the new Gorilla Armor 2 can survive drops up to 2.2 meters, which is great if you're someone that doesn't use a case. For the most part, this is really one of those small features that's not going to get a lot of attention and will go unnoticed on launch day. But it's good to see Samsung still making small improvements, despite most of us wanting to see some huge changes to its phones.\nIf you have yet to preorder a Galaxy S25 phone, you still have time. Samsung, along with retailers and wireless carriers, are running some serious promotions right now that can save you big. So be sure to check out the deals if you're looking to buy a new phone. If not, it might be good to wait anyways, because Samsung does have something else up its sleeve that will see a release in 2025.\n-\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n- SoC\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy\n- RAM\n- 12GB\n- Storage\n- 256GB, 512GB, 1TB\n- Battery\n- 5,000mAh\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- Android 15 and One UI 7\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra leaves the Note-like design behind for the very first time.

      "text": "IP ratings\nIP ratings\nElectric and electronic equipment deteriorate or malfunction when water or dust enters the device. The IEC has developed the ingress protection (IP) ratings, which grade the resistance of an enclosure against the intrusion of dust or liquids.The ratings are widely used throughout industry.\nIn recent years, many consumers have taken an interest in smartphone features that include resilience against liquid and dust. However, it can be difficult to assess the meaning of terms such as waterproof or water-resistant when used for marketing purposes.\nIEC 60529 has been developed to rate and grade the resistance of enclosures of electric and electronic devices against the intrusion of dust and liquids. It also rates how easy it is for individuals to access the potentially hazardous parts within the enclosure.\nThe standard, prepared by IEC Technical Committee 70, uses the IP code to rate the degrees of protection offered by the enclosure of electrical equipment with a rated voltage of a maximum of 72,5 kV. The standard also defines the tests to be performed to verify that the enclosure meets these requirements.\nThe IP code is composed of two numerals:\nThe first numeral refers to the protection against solid objects and is rated on a scale from 0 (no protection) to 6 (no ingress of dust).\nThe second numeral rates the enclosure\u2019s protection against liquids and uses a scale from 0 (no protection) to 9 (high-pressure hot water from different angles).\nThe first edition of IEC 60529 was published in 1976 with the aim of creating a single document to bring together all requirements regarding protection by enclosures. Previously, separate standards had been developed for motors and low-voltage switchgear and controlgear.\nThe information provided on this webpage is for informational purposes only. For a full description of the IP ratings, including their testing conditions, please refer to IEC 60529."

      "text": "Summary\n- Manufacturers are now making waterproof phones the norm, with most upcoming smartphones expected to have some form of dust and water protection.\n- When you invest in a new device, like a smartwatch or phone, it's necessary for it to survive minor accidents like falling in water or the toilet.\n- Understanding IP ratings is crucial when it comes to knowing the level of protection your device has against dust and water, ensuring durability.\nModern phones rarely come without some kind of protection from the elements, particularly against dust and water. What used to be quite a niche feature of purpose-built phones has now become a standard, and most upcoming smartphones will likely have some form of protection. What's more, when companies release their flagship phones, everybody expects them to come with waterproofing -- if they don't, it is counted as a big miss and overall flaw of the device.\nHonestly, it shouldn't come as a surprise. If you're spending good money on a device, whether it's an action camera, smart sports watch or a new phone, you need to know it's going to survive the rain or an accidental trip into a toilet bowl.\nManufacturers know about this, so most of the new phones, especially the higher-end ones, come with water and dust protection nowadays. It's also resulted in some controversies, such as Apple trying to use it to explain getting rid of the headphone jack as a way to make their phones waterproof -- and not as a way to sell Bluetooth headphones.\nManufacturers telling you that the device is waterproof is one thing, though, but having it confirmed by a third party is another. That's why all the waterproof devices have some kind of certificate that informs you what types of conditions they can withstand and guarantees that the product passed rigorous tests to confirm its resistance levels. Unfortunately, this system might be a bit confusing. It can be confusing with so many different codes, stamps and names for water and dust-resistant qualities and certifications. Let us explain what all of these mean.\nYour AirPods aren't waterproof: 5 things to do if they get wet\nYour AirPods are sweat and water resistant, but they're not waterproof. So, here's what to do if they get wet -- and no, rice isn't the answer.\nWhat do the letters and numbers stand for?\nIf a device has an IP rating, it's been given an official seal of approval\nThe mIP rating is the most common waterproofing certificate on electronic devices. This certification is regulated by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and is generally recognized as reliable and trustworthy. If you see an IP rating on your device, you can be sure that it was properly tested and conforms to the specified standards.\nIP ratings are usually made up of four characters. There are two letters followed by two numbers, without any hyphens or spaces between them. It's important to remember what the certification looks like, as some dodgy manufacturers might try to deceive you by putting similarly-looking codes on their device to trick you into thinking it was certified as waterproof.\nThe first two characters, I and P, stand for Ingress Protection or -- in other words -- how good it is at stopping stuff from getting inside it. The first numeral indicates how good it is at protecting against small solids (dust/sand, etc.), with a maximum rating of 6. This ranges from no protection at all to being dust-tight.\nAfter the four usual characters, you might also get some additional letters denoting particular kinds of elemental protection. However, these are much more technical and do not appear on personal tech products, so you really don't have to worry about them.\n|\n1st Numeral |\nSolid object/dust resistance |\n|---|---|\n|\n0 |\nNo protection |\n|\n1 |\nProtected against solid objects 50mm or larger |\n|\n2 |\nProtected against solid objects 12.5mm or larger |\n|\n3 |\nProtected against solid objects 2.5mm or larger |\n|\n4 |\nProtected against solid objects 1.0mm or larger |\n|\n5 |\nDust-protected (but not completely dust-tight) |\n|\n6 |\nDust tight |\nThe second numeral is the liquid or water resistance rating, with a max rating of 9. That's from no protection up to high-pressure and high-temperature water jets.\n6 features you should look for in workout earbuds and headphones\nDemanding workouts mean demanding headphone specs.\n|\n2nd Numeral |\nWater resistance |\n|---|---|\n|\n0 |\nNo protection |\n|\n1 |\nProtected against small drops falling vertically onto the device head-on |\n|\n2 |\nProtected against small drops falling vertically with the device at a 15-degree angle |\n|\n3 |\nProtected against water being sprayed up to a 60-degree angle on either side of the device |\n|\n4 |\nProtected against splashes against the device from any direction |\n|\n5 |\nProtected against water being projected gently in jets |\n|\n6 |\nProtected against water being projected in powerful jets |\n|\n7 |\nProtected against being immersed in water temporarily |\n|\n8 |\nProtected against being continuously immersed in water for a longer period |\n|\n9 |\nProtected against water being projected at high pressure and temperature |\nIn other words, if you see IP69 somewhere, you know it offers the highest IP rating for both dust and water resistance. At least when it comes to the IP-rating certification.\nThere is one more sign that might appear in place of the two numbers -- it's the capitalized X. If you see the X in place of one of the numbers, it means that insufficient data was collected in order to certify the device in this area. The IP certification costs the manufacturer a considerable amount of money, so if they have another certificate or feel like they don't need one of the IP standards, they might just opt for certifying for one of the two types of protection.\nThis budget, waterproof Anker speaker is my perfect audio companion\nAt under $40, Soundcore's original Bluetooth speaker delivers clear audio come rain or shine -- and even in the shower.\nWhat does IP68 mean?\nMost modern flagship smartphones come with IP68 certification\nThere are numerous combinations when it comes to IP ratings, and it can get confusing, but IP68 is one of the most common you'll find on technology devices.\nWhen it comes to solids, devices have been tested against dust and found to be dust-tight. Anything with a \"6\" as the first numeral is as impervious to dust as can be tested and certified on this particular scale. For the second numeral, the 8 denotes that it's protected against submersion in water up to a defined depth and time duration.\n- IP = Ingress Protection\n- 6 = Dust Tight\n- 8 = Survives being submerged in water\nI use these 7 gadgets and apps to run faster and stronger\nWhile all you really need is shoes, these gadgets and apps can totally boost your jog time.\nIt's probably worth noting that just because something is IP68-rated and great at lasting underwater, it may not be tested to withstand rain or spray from a jet of some kind. This is why Sony states IP65/68 on its devices. However, in most cases, you'd assume that if a device conforms to the IP68 standard, it also should be able to handle the conditions needed to pass the IP65 certification.\nAnother thing to mention is that the IEC (which governs the international standards for IP ratings) doesn't specify what the depth or the duration of water protection is -- it just sets a standard for 7 and 8, saying that 8 needs to be more than 7. Typically, you'll find that 7 would be 1 meter for 30 minutes, and 8 would be more than that -- but manufacturers should state what protection level has been tested. For instance, Apple says its IP68-rated iPhone 15 can survive being up to 6 meters deep for up to 30 minutes.\nWhat about IP65, IP53, or others?\nYou'll find these ratings on many earbuds, speakers, and midrange phones\nOften times, you'll see products with more than one IP rating, and that's simply because they're tested for different kinds of waterproofing. For instance, the Sony Xperia 1 IV has both IP68 and IP65 ratings. As mentioned already, the IP68 rating means it can survive being submerged. IP65 denotes that it's also good at handling spray.\nTechnically, it's tested using water being projected by a 6.3mm nozzle. In real-world use, though, it just means it can survive rain or a shower. Just don't go spraying it with a pressure washer.\nIf you find an older device with IP53, that means it's somewhat protected against dust, but not totally, and can live with spraying water, but not jets of water and certainly not being submerged.\nIf the Beats Fit Pro 2 has these 6 features, they'll be the best workout headphones\nIf they include adaptive transparency mode and five other improvements, the next generation Beats Fit Pro will be my best recommendation.\nWhat's with the Apple Watch's IP6X, WR50, and WR100 ratings?\nThe Apple Watch can survive a plunge in fairly deep water\n- IP6X = Dust tight\n- WR50 = Water resistant up to 50M\n- WR100 = Water resistant up to 100M\nApple Watch Series 7 was announced in September 2021, and -- in the announcement -- two unfamiliar terms were used to denote how water and dust-resistant the latest watches are: IP6X and WR50. These have since translated across to the Series 8 and the Apple Watch SE (2nd generation). The Watch Ultra has IP6X, too, though it has WR100 instead of WR50.\nAs I've already mentioned, the first numerical value is for dust resistance. Like any device with IP68 or IP67, that \"6\" means it's dust resistant to a very high level or is \"dust tight\", meaning no dust can get into the watch. The \"X\" means it doesn't have an IP rating against water, but that doesn't mean it's not water-proof -- it's just not certified as conforming to that standard.\nIt's much more common for watches to supply water protection figures in depth (50m, for example) or in atmospheres.\nApple's (and others) WR50 and WR100 labels mean water-resistant to 50 meters or 100 meters, respectively, and since that's way above the 1.5m depth that's certified by the standard IP-rating system, there's no real need to have devices with those labels certified. They're water-tight, and you can take them swimming or out in the rain on a run.\nIt's much more common for watches to supply water protection figures in depth (50m, for example) or in atmospheres (5ATM), which is a reflection that it will survive the water pressure at that depth.\nApple Watch Ultra 3: Everything we know so far\nIt's safer to expect an evolutionary upgrade instead of anything particularly earth-shattering.\nWhat does IPX7 or IPX8 mean?\nThe X signifies that the product hasn't been officially certified\nThe presence of the X in the rating does throw some people, but devices like the first generation Apple Watch, some Garmin cameras and wearables, and even some phones feature it. It means the device hasn't been certified for protection against dust, but doesn't mean it isn't dust-resistant.\nThis simply means it can withstand water ingress -- such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, which has an IPX8 rating, meaning it can withstand immersion in water but has no protection against dust ingress (because of the hinge design).\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 vs Z Flip 4: What's changed?\nSamsung's Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Z Flip 5 are very similar, until they're not. Here's how they compare and differ, and which one is right for most.\nWhat is nano-coating?\nIt's a hydrophobic coating that's designed to repel water away from sensitive components\nNano-coating is a microscopically applied film that's sprayed over the internal components to help water roll away from anything that could potentially be damaged by moisture.\nSome companies like to build their phones with a water-repellent nano-coating but don't offer a specific IP rating. With these devices, like the old Moto Z, the phone will probably be fine with accidental spills, light rain, or the odd splash, but it won't survive being submerged or when faced with jets of water or heavy rain.\nThis type of nano-coating has evolved and will offer complete protection from submersion, too, without relying on seals in the phone's body.\nBest waterproof earbuds: Don't fear the rain\nRain, sweat, and cables shouldn't get in the way of listening on the go.\nWhat does ATM mean?\nIt stands for 'atmospheres', not to be confused with 'Automated Teller Machines'\nAlthough some smartwatches will include an IP rating, you'll more often than not find waterproof capabilities denoted by ATM, at least with watches designed for sports or outdoor activities. ATM stands for atmospheres (nothing to do with cash machines) and basically indicates how much pressure it can take. Or, in other words, how deep can you take it underwater?\nIt's normally reserved for devices designed to be used underwater, and in most cases, 1 ATM is 10 meters, 5 ATM is 50 meters and 10 ATM is 100 meters. With the Apple Watch models (except the Apple Watch Ultra), for example, that depth is 50 meters, so it can be used to track swimming.\nFor a breakdown of each individual's possible IP rating, check out the level-by-level chart at the IEC.\nAre AirPods waterproof? Water resistance explained\nYour favourite little earbuds might not be as durable as you'd like, depending on which you have."
