      "summary": "Bitcoin's price has been volatile, recently hitting a record high of $124,515 before dropping over 4% due to rising inflation concerns and comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding the U.S. government's Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The cryptocurrency's market cap reached around $2.5 trillion, with Ether also seeing significant gains. Meanwhile, electric vehicle prices are rising due to tariffs and expiring tax credits, making affordable options scarce, as highlighted by various models under $35,000.",
