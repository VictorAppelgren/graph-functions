  "description": "Stray Kids score career highs in the U.K. with Karma, debuting across six albums charts while new single \u201cCeremony\u201d adds to the group's growing tally of hits.",
  "content": "Stray Kids release new music several times a year, and the audience shows up every time. In the United Kingdom this week, Karma becomes a career-defining win for the group \u2013 another one, that is \u2013 as the set delivers new all-time best showings for the band on every tally it touches this frame.\n\nThe latest from the K-pop favorites opens at No. 5 on the Official Album Downloads chart this frame, becoming the fifth-most-downloaded title in the U.K. Karma becomes Stray Kids\u2019 fifth top 10 on the tally and the group\u2019s new highest-rising win. Previously, the South Korean powerhouses topped out at No. 7 with both Rock-Star and Ate.\n\nStray Kids Reach a New High on the Biggest Album List\n\nOn the all-consumption Official Albums chart, Karma begins at No. 22 \u2014 a new best for the band. The just-released project improves upon 5-Star, which peaked at No. 40 back in 2023. The most recent entry before Karma, Hop, only managed to hit No. 91 in December 2024, so a top 30 arrival marks a major step up from just months ago.\n\nThe set also delivers a first for Stray Kids on the Official Albums Sales chart: a top 40 smash. Karma debuts at No. 12 on the all-format sales ranking, sailing past the group\u2019s prior peak with Ate (No. 42).\n\nA Streaming Win as Well with Karma\n\nOn the Official Albums Streaming chart, Karma sneaks in and becomes a new highest appearance for the group as well. The new album opens at No. 33 \u2014 just ahead of the No. 35 high 5-Star managed in June 2023.\n\nKarma introduces Stray Kids to two rankings the singers hadn\u2019t reached before in the U.K. The project appears at No. 19 on the Official Physical Albums chart and at No. 13 on the Official Vinyl Albums roster. As first entries, both immediately stand as the band\u2019s high-water marks on those lists.\n\nThe album rollout is paired with a new singles win. \u201cCeremony\u201d debuts at No. 37 on the Official Singles chart, adding to the group\u2019s growing collection on the main songs list, which is now up to six in total. The cut also starts at No. 29 on the Official Singles Sales tally, No. 25 on the Official Singles Downloads list, and No. 68 on the Official Streaming roster.",
