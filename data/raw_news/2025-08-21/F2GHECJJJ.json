  "title": "Trump tariffs push India closer to America's strategic rivals China and Russia",
  "description": "India strengthens ties with Moscow and Beijing as US-India relationship faces its most serious test in years following disputes over Russian oil purchases.",
  "content": "For more than two decades, Washington and New Delhi built a strategic partnership that was hailed as one of the great success stories of post\u2013Cold War diplomacy. Today, that relationship is facing its most serious test in years \u2014 and India is signaling it has other options.\n\n\"We\u2019re in a situation in the U.S.\u2013India relationship where the premises and assumptions of the last 25 years \u2014 that everybody worked very hard to build, including the president in his first term \u2014 have just come completely unraveled,\" said Evan Feigenbaum, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The trust is gone.\"\n\nSince President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on Indian imports, New Delhi has turned visibly eastward. India\u2019s national security advisor traveled to Moscow in recent weeks, its foreign minister is visiting this week and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi just concluded talks in Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is preparing for his first trip to China in more than seven years, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to host him in Moscow before the end of the year.\n\nThe pivot underscores how tariffs meant to punish India for its continued purchases of Russian oil may instead be pushing New Delhi closer to America\u2019s rivals.\n\nTRUMP AND PUTIN\u2019S RELATIONSHIP TURNS SOUR AS PRESIDENT PUSHES FOR RESOLUTION WITH UKRAINE\n\nTrump slapped a 25% tariff on Indian imports earlier this year, citing India\u2019s willingness to keep buying Russian crude. On August 27, that tariff is set to double to 50%.\n\nIndian public opinion has bristled at what many see as U.S. interference in sovereign decision-making. \"They\u2019re signaling very clearly that they view that as interference in India\u2019s foreign policy, and they are not going to put up with it,\" Feigenbaum said.\n\nDespite initial hesitation, state-run refiners resumed Russian oil purchases, lured by discounts of 6\u20137%. Russian oil now accounts for 35% of India\u2019s imports, up from a negligible 0.2% before the Ukraine war. Moscow, for its part, has seized the opening. \"We continue to ship fuel, including crude oil and oil products, thermal and coking coal,\" said Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov. \"We see potential for the export of Russian LNG.\"\n\nTRUMP\u2019S DEADLINE ON SECONDARY TARIFFS ARRIVES; US-RUSSIAN RELATIONS HANG IN THE BALANCE\n\nRussia is using the rift to promote its vision of a \"great Eurasian partnership\" linking Moscow, Beijing and Delhi.\n\n\"All of this engagement we\u2019re seeing between India and China now is not exclusively coming because of Trump and his tariffs,\" said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst. \"We\u2019ve actually seen indications for almost a year of India wanting to ease tensions with China and strengthen relations, mainly for economic reasons. But the Trump administration\u2019s policies have made India want to move even more quickly.\"\n\nSome of India\u2019s moves are diplomatic theater meant to signal anger at Washington. But others are more durable. \"India is going to double down on some aspects of its economic and defense relationship with Russia,\" Feigenbaum said. \"And those parts are not performative.\"\n\nKugelman noted that before the Ukraine war, India had already begun reducing its reliance on Russian arms imports in favor of U.S., French and Israeli systems. \"But as soon as the invasion happened, India very quickly started buying more from Russia, particularly energy,\" he said. \"This is essentially validation of a view in India that the U.S. can\u2019t be trusted, whereas Russia can \u2014 because Russia is always going to be there for India no matter what.\"\n\nModi has used the standoff to reinforce his image at home as a defender of sovereignty. \"India actually made a fair number of concessions to the Trump administration early on in its second term,\" Kugelman said, citing tariff reductions and agreements to repatriate undocumented workers. \"Because of those concessions, India needs to be careful about signaling further willingness to bend. This is one reason there was no trade deal \u2014 Modi put his foot down.\"\n\nWhile not directly criticizing Trump, Modi has emphasized that his priority is protecting the livelihoods of farmers, small businesses and young workers. That defiant tone, Kugelman added, has \"real political mileage\" in India\u2019s domestic debate.\n\nThe Trump administration has shown no signs of backing down. Former White House trade advisor Peter Navarro blasted India\u2019s oil purchases as \"opportunistic\" and \"deeply corrosive\" in a Financial Times op-ed this week.\n\n\"This two-pronged policy will hit India where it hurts \u2014 its access to U.S. markets \u2014 even as it seeks to cut off the financial lifeline it has extended to Russia\u2019s war effort,\" Navarro wrote. \"If India wants to be treated as a strategic partner of the U.S., it needs to start acting like one.\"\n\nINDIAN PRIME MINISTER MODI TAKES PAGE FROM TRUMP, SAYS 'MAKE INDIA GREAT AGAIN,' OR 'MIGA'\n\nThe contrast with the U.S.\u2013India relationship of two decades ago could not be starker. In 2008, the two countries struck a landmark civil nuclear deal that gave India access to American technology and fuel despite not being a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n\"India put the entire government on the line for the deal,\" Feigenbaum recalled. \"Bush really went to the mat and provided a lot of assurances to Congress that were politically not easy, but he was willing to take risks for the relationship.\"\n\nAt that time, Washington and Delhi managed to work around their disagreements. \"The U.S. objected to many aspects of India\u2019s relationships with Iran, Burma and Russia,\" Feigenbaum said. \"India objected to aspects of the U.S. relationships with China and Pakistan. But neither side let that bleed back into the bilateral relationship in a completely debilitating way.\"\n\nFor years, the U.S. has viewed India as a democratic counterweight to China\u2019s authoritarian model \u2014 central to its Indo-Pacific strategy under Obama, Trump and Biden. But now the question is whether that glue still holds.\n\n\"Both sides agree that countering China is the main glue that has really bound this relationship together over this 20-year period,\" Kugelman said. \"But the tensions, most of which are on the trade side, have begun to spill over into the broader partnership.\"\n\nHe noted that India will continue to see China as a long-term competitor because of border disputes and Beijing\u2019s alliance with Pakistan. \"Those realities make it hard to imagine India no longer seeing China as a threat,\" he said. \"So the rationale for the Quad remains. But if the U.S.\u2013India relationship continues this free fall, it will be very difficult to sustain.\"\n\nTalks on new defense cooperation are still on the calendar. But for now, Kugelman warned, trust has eroded: \"You talk about defense cooperation, intelligence sharing \u2014 that requires a lot of trust. And given what\u2019s happened over the last few months, that might be a harder sell for the Indians.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFeigenbaum sees India\u2019s latest maneuvers as a reversal of past dynamics. \"Then, India was leveraging its partnership to signal to then-foe China that it had options,\" he said. \"Now they\u2019re working with the Chinese to signal Washington rather than the other way around.\"\n\nThe message is clear: India will pursue its interests on its own terms, even if that means drawing closer to America\u2019s rivals.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump is preparing to announce new secondary tariffs Friday on nations who conduct trade with Russia amid its deadly war in Ukraine.\nThe White House has remained tight-lipped on what those tariffs will look like after the president first said in July they would amount to \"100%\" tariffs before causing confusion earlier this week when he told reporters he \"never said a percentage.\"\nWhile the specifics of what tax rates nations that trade with Russia could face remain unclear, Trump\u2019s change in posture toward Russian President Vladimir Putin has become increasingly evident.\nFROM TALK TO TACTICS: TRUMP PIVOTS ON RUSSIA STRATEGY TO END WAR\n\"Trump's frustrated that the Russians have not taken advantage of his patience and generous offers, but it's very interesting that even after Trump announced he was moving submarines, and even after he announced the tough tariffs, the Russians still want to talk to him,\" Fred Fleitz, who served as a deputy assistant to Trump and chief of staff of the National Security Council during the president\u2019s first term, told Fox News Digital.\n\"Putin does not want to anger Trump,\" he added. \"Putin never worried about angering Biden, and I think that this shows a degree of respect.\n\"It shows what Trump has achieved by exercising leadership on the global stage. And we'll see what happens,\" Fleitz said, adding he hoped it was not merely a stalling tactic by Putin.\nTrump\u2019s return to the White House brought with it a sense of shock as he appeared to distance Washington from its top allies in Europe in favor of attempting to improve diplomatic relations with Putin, culminating in the infamous Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.\nWhile the tussle brought renewed support from his top MAGA base, who favor ending U.S. involvement in foreign wars, it prompted concern among security experts. Ultimately, Trump\u2019s patience with Putin began to shift, with the president consistently expressing his frustration at the Kremlin chief\u2019s continued brutal attacks in Ukraine.\nIn mid-July, while sitting next to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump announced Putin had 50 days to enter into a ceasefire or face \"very severe\" tariffs that would affect Moscow's top commodity, oil.\nZELENSKYY TELLS PUTIN TO 'BE BRAVE' AND FINALLY AGREE TO TRILATERAL MEETING WITH TRUMP\n\"Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs,\" he had said, indicating that nations that trade with Russia will see 100% tariffs slapped on them when trading with the U.S.\nThis would most greatly affect China and India, according to data released by the U.S. government Thursday, which showed both nations account for 46% of all Russian oil purchases in 2025.\nBut the U.S. is also the No. 1 export market for both China and India, which means higher price tags at the checkout line on their products will make Americans think twice before completing those purchases.\nAfter ongoing trade negotiations with both nations and Putin\u2019s continued war effort in Ukraine, Trump last week pushed up his deadline to within 10 days of July 29, forcing a new deadline of Friday.\nBut while his promised tariffs were met with applause by some in the GOP, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 he, along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-C.T., is pushing the charge for 500% sanctions on Russia \u2014 other Republican members have not backed the move.\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been outspoken against not only Trump\u2019s tariffs but the bipartisan sanction push and argued to Fox Business\u2019 Larry Kudlow this week that Trump\u2019s tariffs on allies and foes alike will amount to $2 trillion in taxes for the American consumer.\nBut Fleitz pushed back on this argument and said he is not convinced that the tariffs will hurt the U.S. or Chinese economy, though Russia and India are likely to feel the pain.\n\"I think they're going to hurt the Russian and Indian economies,\" he said, noting that India could recover by buying oil elsewhere. Though some reporting has suggested that India may have saved over $30 billion by increasingly turning to Russian oil during 2022-2024 due to Moscow\u2019s price cuts.\nTRUMP OPEN TO MEET PUTIN FACE-TO-FACE NEXT WEEK FOLLOWED BY THREE-WAY TALKS WITH UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY\n\"It is going to be another factor that's going to pressure Putin to agree to a ceasefire. I don't know if that's going to happen immediately or in a few months, but I think it is going to put real pressure, inflict real pain on Russia,\" Fleitz said.\nOnce a staunch Trump ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R- Ga., took to X this week in response to a post by Trump that he would be enforcing tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil and said, \"End Indian H1-B visas replacing American jobs instead and stop funding and sending weapons to the Obama/Biden/Neocon Ukraine Russia war.\"\nTrump\u2019s favorable transition toward Ukraine and European allies has also ruffled some MAGA feathers, though security experts have argued it has given the president better leverage to take on major adversaries like Putin, and by extension, China.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Diplomacy and negotiations are a good thing,\" said Fleitz, who serves as vice chair of the America First Policy Institute's Center for American Security. \"Peacemaking takes time, and the U.S.-Russia relationship was in a very bad situation when Trump came to office.\n\"I think these sanctions will hurt Russia very badly,\" Fleitz continued. \"The fact that Trump knows that secondary sanctions on India has, at least temporarily, hurt our relationship is really a remarkable sign of how committed Trump is to these sanctions.\n\"There's not going to be exceptions. It's not going to be some type of soft strategy with all kinds of loopholes,\" he added. \"I think it shows to Putin how serious Trump is, and it gives Trump leverage to negotiate with Putin.\""

      "text": "While President Donald Trump previously refrained from speaking ill of Russian President Vladimir Putin, those days are over.\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has changed the nature of their dynamic. Although the two appeared to get along, at least publicly, during Trump\u2019s first administration, their relationship has unraveled as the more recent conflict persists.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has refused to mince his words when asked about Putin. Trump said during a Cabinet meeting July 8 he was fed up with Putin and said he was eyeing potentially imposing new sanctions on Russia.\n\"We get a lot of bulls--- thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,\" Trump said. \"He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\"\nTRUMP MOVES NUCLEAR SUBMARINES WEEKS AFTER PRAISING SUB'S POWER IN IRAN STRIKES\nJohn Hardie, Russia program deputy director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Russia started to attract ire from Trump dating back to March after Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire. But Russia has failed to get on board with a ceasefire.\n\"Really, since then, I think Trump has come to view the Russians as the main impediment to a deal,\" Hardie told Fox News Digital Thursday.\nAdditionally, Hardie said that Trump has also grown frustrated that Russia will launch drone and missile attacks against Ukraine, even after directly speaking with Putin.\n\"What he's sort of latched on to are these Russian drone and missile barrages,\" Hardie said. \"That really seems to resonate with him.\"\nTensions only have continued to escalate between the U.S. and Russia since the July Cabinet meeting.\nTrump announced July 14 that he would sign off on \"severe tariffs\" against Russia if Moscow failed to agree to a peace deal within 50 days. He then dramatically reduced the deadline to only 10\u201312 days \u2014 which ends Friday.\nThe decision to reduce the timeline prompted former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to caution that \"each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war.\"\nTRUMP LIFTS VEIL ON US SUBMARINES IN WARNING SHOT TO KREMLIN IN \u2018CLEVER\u2019 REPOSITIONING MOVE\nIn addition to economic sanctions, Trump responded to Medvedev and issued a rare statement disclosing that two U.S. Navy submarines would be moved in response to escalating threats from Russia.\n\"I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,\" Trump said Aug. 1.\nTrump's disclosure of the submarine presence puts additional pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table, according to Bryan Clark, a retired submarine officer and director of the Hudson Institute think tank\u2019s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology.\n\"We have used very sparingly submarines to try to influence adversary behavior before, but this is pretty unusual, to do it against a nuclear-powered adversary like Russia in response to a nuclear threat by Russia,\" Clark told Fox News Digital Monday. \"So I think this is trying to essentially push back on Russia's frequent and long-standing threats to use nuclear weapons in part of the Ukraine conflict.\"\nMomentum is picking up on negotiations though, and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin Wednesday.\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social afterward that \"great progress\" was made during the meeting. And now, Trump and Putin are expected to meet face to face imminently in an attempt to finally advance negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nStill, Hardie said he is skeptical that the meeting between Putin and Trump will result in meaningful progress.\n\"I don't expect a summit to produce much,\" Hardie said. \"And I think Putin could try to use the summit to placate Trump and kind of buy more time continues assault on Ukraine, but I think his goal is he'd love to be able to enlist Trump in his effort to impose these harsh terms on Ukraine.\"\nRussia has pushed for concessions in a peace deal that include barring Ukraine from joining NATO, preventing foreign peacekeeper troops from deploying to Ukraine after the conflict, and adjusting some of the borders that previously were Ukraine's.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Trump plans to announce any additional economic burdens upon Russia Friday in accordance with the deadline that he imposed demanding that Russia signal willingness to end the conflict. But according to Trump, the ball is in Putin\u2019s court.\n\"It\u2019s going to be up to him,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We\u2019re going to see what he has to say. It\u2019s going to be up to him. Very disappointed.\"\nThe White House did not disclose any details regarding potential Friday sanctions, but said that Trump wants to meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Putin to resolve the conflict.\n\"The Russians expressed their desire to meet with President Trump, and the President is open to this meeting,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"President Trump would like to meet with both President Putin and President Zelensky because he wants this brutal war to end. The White House is working through the details of these potential meetings and details will be provided at the appropriate time.\""

  "argos_summary": "The article describes how U.S. tariffs on Indian imports under Trump have eroded a 25\u2011year partnership, prompting India to pivot eastward, deepen ties with Russia and China, and buy discounted Russian oil. Indian officials and analysts say the trust that underpinned cooperation on defense, trade and intelligence has collapsed, and Modi is using the dispute to rally domestic support for sovereignty. While the U.S. remains a key strategic partner, the relationship now faces its most serious test, with India signaling it can pursue its interests independently of Washington.",
