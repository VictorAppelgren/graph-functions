  "title": "The CEO\u2019s Playbook for Team Feedback That Delivers Results",
  "description": "CEOs set the tone for their companies. By modeling personal input and follow-up, you create a culture where feedback is normal and growth is expected.",
  "content": "How can people work together to help one another succeed? It\u2019s a deceptively simple question, and one of the most powerful tools you have as a CEO. Imagine introducing a practice of you and your senior leaders each identifying one specific, observable behavior to improve yourselves. These are concrete actions such as \u201cend every meeting with agreed next steps\u201d or \u201cpause before responding to tough questions.\u201d You choose which actions to prioritize by blending what matters most to you with what your colleagues say would make the biggest difference for them.\n\nSet the tone at the top. When you, as CEO, go first\u2014inviting feedback, listening without defensiveness, and adding your own insight to the mix\u2014you give your team permission to do the same. This is the essence of stakeholder-centered coaching, a process pioneered by Marshall Goldsmith and colleagues. It combines external feedback from those affected by your leadership with your own internal clarity about what matters most right now. That combination produces goals that are both meaningful and doable. Once you\u2019ve set your personal focus, share it openly and ask a few people to watch for it in action. Follow up periodically, with check-in statements such as \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my communication\u2014what are you noticing about it?\u201d These brief exchanges keep the process alive and send a clear signal\u2014progress matters, feedback is welcome, and everyone is accountable for their own growth. Throughout time, this becomes less \u201cthe CEO\u2019s latest project\u201d and more \u201cjust how things are done here,\u201d a habit of learning with real accountability.\n\nWhat\u2019s your first response to the idea of getting and giving behavioral feedback being a routine part of your culture? What one behavior rises to the top when you combine your own self-assessment with feedback from others? How will you model this practice so that your team feels safe and inspired to do the same? 7 steps for you and your leadership team\n\u2022 Ask and reflect. Gather quick input from three to five colleagues on one behavior you can improve. Next, weigh it alongside your own priorities and the organization\u2019s needs and performance review initiatives.\n\u2022 Make it public. Share your chosen focus with your team so they can notice and support your progress.\n\u2022 Check progress regularly. Once or twice a month, ask those same colleagues what they\u2019ve observed and thank them for their input.\n\u2022 Coach your team to do the same. Walk each senior leader through the process. Help them identify their behavior, seek input, and set a check-in plan.\n\u2022 Embed feedback into leadership meetings. Start monthly leadership meetings with a five-minute \u201cwhat I\u2019m working on\u201d round. Keep it light but consistent.\n\u2022 Pair people up. Encourage leaders to choose an \u201caccountability buddy\u201d who will observe their shift and give real-time feedback.\n\u2022 Capture and share wins. Create a shared document or quick Slack channel where leaders can post \u201csmall wins\u201d and what they\u2019ve noticed about themselves or others. As CEO, your behavior sets the tone inside your company. By modeling a clear, consistent cycle of input, reflection, action, and follow-up to improve your own behaviors, you create a culture that welcomes feedback and facilitates growth. When leaders at every level see you doing this\u2014choosing your own focus, asking for input, acting on it, and looping back\u2014they\u2019re far more likely to follow suit. Throughout time, the practice becomes part of your organization\u2019s DNA. Thus, your company culture becomes more adaptive, connected, and effective. All because you started with one well-chosen behavior, the courage to work on it openly, and the willingness to invite your team to join you.\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
