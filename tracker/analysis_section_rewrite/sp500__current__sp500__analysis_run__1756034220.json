      "feedback": "The 0–3 week thesis should center on the Intel government stake story (1090 basis points in the near term), with the following concrete edits to lift world‑class quality: (1) anchor the narrative on the precise facts from the source: the U.S. government will own about 10% of Intel, with a passive tranche of 9.9% and up to ~15% total on vesting, and it will vote with the board, creating a governance tilt (XQWTVR71K); (2) couple this with the near‑term policy backdrop by tying Powell’s Jackson Hole comments to a still‑constructive risk‑on regime and the market pricing of a September rate cut at roughly 90% odds, and translate that into a near‑term reaction function for risk assets (XQWTVR71K); (3) add the cross‑border angle by incorporating Canada’s plan to mirror the USMCA carve‑out for compliant goods, signaling a potential North American supply‑chain and tariff dynamic that supports near‑term risk appetite (XQWTVR71K); (4) replace broad qualitative claims with a tight causal chain: government‑backed governance in a strategic chip name reduces policy and geopolitical risk premia, prompting semis/AI‑hardware equity repricing and a broader risk‑on bid, with transmission through semis and AI names and a stable macro backdrop; (5) articulate explicit triggers and invalidations: vesting progress/governance clarity at Intel (milestones or changes in voting rights) as a near‑term catalyst, and tariff/usmca developments or a sustained deviation in September rate‑cut odds as the main invalidations; (6) add a crisp, three‑path scenario (base/bull/bear) anchored to these triggers, with monotone probability wording rather than price targets since price levels aren’t provided in the sources; (7) tighten “what to monitor next”: concrete data points and deadlines (Intel vesting milestones and governance signals; any USMCA/tariff moves; Fed data and the implied September cut probability); (8) trim non‑essential material (e.g., Shopify‑centric or unrelated equity comments) to preserve horizon discipline; (9) cite each factual claim to the exact source ID after the clause (XQWTVR71K for the Intel/Fed/Canada nexus); and (10) ensure the length stays compact by packing the three drivers, three triggers, and the monitoring checklist into a single coherent paragraph. If you implement these edits, you’ll have a world‑class, horizon‑focused piece with quantified catalysts, explicit invalidation points, and a coherent causal chain across policy, sovereign equity, and cross‑border dynamics.",
