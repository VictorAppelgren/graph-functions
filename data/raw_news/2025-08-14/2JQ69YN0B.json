Ramsey has no known aliases, marks, or tattoos. A warrant for her arrest was issued on July 8.\n\nRamsey was sentenced to probation in December 2023 on drug charges in Coos County Superior Court. \u201cRamsey has absconded from supervision multiple times after each arrest in defiance of her specific bail conditions,\u201d an alert stated. \u201cRamsey has a history of aggressive-defiant behavior towards authority to include resisting arrest.\u201d\n\nRamsey was most recently arrested in Laconia in mid-April. She is known to frequent Lakes Region and North Country communities. Editor's note: This post was derived from information supplied by the New Hampshire Department of Corrections and does not indicate a conviction. This link explains the process for requesting the removal of a name from New Hampshire Patch police reports.\n\nAccording to superior court records, Hailey was accused of witness tampering in January 2023 in Berlin. She was indicted two months later. After failing to appear at an arraignment and bail hearing, a warrant was issued for her arrest. After appearing, she failed to attend a dispositional conference in July 2023. Ramsey was also charged with drug possession and resisting arrest or detention after an incident in Berlin. After being caught again, she was given cash bail. Ramsey failed to appear again in September 2023 and was later given $5,000 cash bail. In December 2023, Ramsey agreed to a plea deal for a lesser charge, obstructing government administration, and received a 12-month sentence with 90 days of time served credit. The tampering charge was then nolle prossed. She also pleaded guilty to the drug and resisting charges and received two 12-month sentences and $868 in fines, all suspended for three years. Ramsey was accused of violating probation in May 2024 and failed to appear at a hearing on July 8.\n\nIn February, she was indicted on drug possession and transport of drugs after an incident in Berlin in June 2023. Ramsey failed to appear at the arraignment and bail hearing on March 11. A motion hearing was held on April 7, but she failed to appear again at a dispositional conference on July 7. Ramsey is due back at probation violation and dispositional conference hearings on Sept. 8. If you know where Ramsey is or have seen anyone who resembles her, do not attempt to apprehend her.

      "text": "Community Corner\nHow To Get Your Name Off A NH Patch Arrest Or Indictment Report\nIf you've been arrested, convicte, or had your info published on a New Hampshire Patch site, here's what you need to know and do to move on.\nHere at the New Hampshire Patch network, we report on many arrests, indictments, and crime incidents in various communities in the Granite State.\nHowever, we also understand that not everyone is convicted of the crimes they allegedly committed. Others have agreed to pleas or have been found not guilty, served their time, and want to move on with their lives. Part of that process is removing your name from the Patch arrest log.\nThe processes are the same for everyone and are based on a similar method as an arrest annulment in the state of New Hampshire. The removal request requires court paperwork, ideally, the Case Summary document, which shows the charges are completely resolved.\nFind out what's happening in Concordfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nSend an in-focus photo or a PDF with all the information to tony.schinella@patch.com or arrestreports@patch.com.\nCourt documents should show the resolution of the case, along with dates and sentencing information. If your case has been placed on hold without a finding, it is not resolved until the end of that time period when the case is closed. If you have a probationary period at the end of the sentencing or were given a suspended sentence for a certain period of time, the case has not been resolved. Please don't contact us about the removal of arrest information until the case has been completely resolved.\nFind out what's happening in Concordfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nIt is important to remember this is a courtesy and not a given in every case.\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
