  "title": "I review vacuums for a living, and here's why every 'hot take' in this viral Dyson-hating X thread is baseless",
  "description": "Stop blaming Dyson for everything that's wrong with cordless stick vacuums",
  "content": "Vacuum cleaners divide opinion more than you might expect, and the brand that people seem to feel most strongly about is Dyson. Behind every diehard Dyson fan there are 10 more people ready to eagerly proclaim that they're the worst vacuums in the world.\n\nAt the weekend, designer Mike Smith proclaimed on X that Dyson vacuums were \"not for serious vacuumers\" and the ensuing thread went viral, with over 1,000 people piling in to air their vacuum views.\n\nI manage the vacuum cleaner content for TechRadar, which includes reviewing vacs from many different brands and putting together our official best vacuum cleaner ranking. All of that means I spend far more time than the average person thinking about vacuum cleaners.\n\nI'm neither wildly pro- or anti-Dyson, and this discussion didn't sway me any further in either direction. What it did do is make me even more confident in my long-held belief that what most people actually have a problem with is not Dyson vacuums, but cordless stick vacuums in general.\n\nCordless stick vacuums are not the same as traditional upright vacuums or canister vacs. In some ways, they're worse. Providing strong suction requires a lot of power, and the bigger the battery the heavier the vacuum \u2013 so brands are constantly trying to balance whether to provide customers with longer runtimes or a lighter build.\n\nA bigger dust cup means a vacuum that's bulkier and heavier, so there's another trade-off there in terms of how often you have to empty it. They also seem to be an inherently less robust type of cleaner \u2013 cordless stick vacs are expected to have a far shorter overall lifespan than other styles of vacuum.\n\nIn short, if you choose a cordless stick vacuum, you should expect limited runtimes on higher suction modes, canisters that need emptying regularly, and for it not to last forever. For those compromises, you get something you don't need to plug into the wall, and which you can easily use to vacuum up the stairs \u2013 or even on the ceiling \u2013 if you want to.\n\nOf course, some cordless vacs perform much better than others, but broadly speaking you should expect those pros and cons to be true whatever model or brand you go for. Dyson stick vacs might not be for \"serious\" vacuuming, but boy are they good for convenient, comfortable vacuuming.\n\nIn the thread, the name that crops up again and again from the opposing chorus is Miele. This brand is synonymous with canister vacuums, and not a direct comparison. One of the very best vacuums I've used in terms of outright suction power remains the 25+ year-old upright that used to belong to my Nana and now lives in my parents' house. But it weighs a ton and takes up a load of space, so when it comes to cleaning my own flat, I'd reach for a Dyson (or similar) every time.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 'The slower you go, the more you will pick up' \u2013 Dyson engineer reveals the most efficient vacuum cleaning technique, backed up by science\n\u2022 Dyson engineer reveals the often-overlooked feature that vacuum cleaners are 'pointless' without \u2013 and it's nothing to do with suction",

      "text": "Shark vs Dyson: which vacuum cleaner brand is better?\nWe run through the key differences between these two vacuum titans\nIf you're in the market for a new vacuum cleaner, you might well find yourself choosing between Dyson vs Shark. These are probably the two most respected and popular vacuum brands on the market right now, and certainly the models we tend to rate the highest here at TechRadar. Both brands crop up repeatedly in our general best vacuum cleaners ranking, as well as our best cordless vacuum roundup.\nBoth Dyson and Shark make plenty of great vacuums, and are well worth checking out. However, depending on what you're looking for, one might be a better choice over the other.\nIn terms of brand focus, Dyson is all about engineering. It has invested plenty of time and resources into its vacuums, and it's continuously working to hone its designs to improve efficiency, suction power and battery life. Today's best Dyson vacuums tend to be meticulously crafted, more high-tech, but more expensive, as a result.\nShark has a much wider, more varied range. Its models are often less tech-focused and instead spotlight usability \u2013 a great example is the forward-bending wand for cleaning under furniture. Today's best Shark vacuums also tend to come in at a lower price compared to Dyson models, delivering good value for money.\nAnd there are plenty more subtle differences worth considering, too. Read on for my in-depth Shark vs Dyson vacuum comparison.\nShark vs Dyson: range\n- Dyson's range mainly comprises cordless stick vacuums\n- Shark has a much wider selection of vacuum types\n- Dyson's range is fairly streamlined, Shark's is wider and confusing\nDyson has a fairly straightforward vacuum range. Its main focus, and arguably what it's still best known for, is its cordless stick vacuums. Alongside the main model, you'll find alternatives with words such as \"Complete\", \"Absolute\" and \"Animal\" on the end. Generally speaking, these will be the same vacuum, but with a different array of tools included, or perhaps in a different colorway.\nAt time of writing, the oldest model in the official lineup is the Dyson V8, which launched in 2016. It looks roughly like the rest of the Dyson cordless range, but is less powerful, with fewer fancy features.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThat's followed by the Dyson Cyclone V10, which hit the market in 2018. This was the model to introduce the \"in-line configuration\" seen on all subsequent stick vacs, which saw the motor, bin and cyclone array positioned in a straight line, to maximize suction power. See how it compares to its predecessor in our Dyson V8 vs V10 explainer.\nIn 2019, we got the Dyson V11. This introduced the LCD screen for alerts and information, where previous models used LED indicator lights. Our Dyson V10 vs V11 explainer has more detail.\nNext to launch in 2021 was the new flagship, the Dyson V15 Detect. This model added dirt detection capabilities and a floorhead featuring a laser to highlight hidden dust. See how it compares to the previous flagship in our Dyson V11 vs V15 face-off. There's also a V15s Detect Submarine, which is a cordless stick vacuum whose standard floorhead can be swapped out for an optional wet cleaner floorhead.\nThat same year, Dyson launched the V12 Detect Slim, a kind of in-between model that's a slightly more advanced, but smaller and lighter, version of the V15.\nAt time of writing, the latest and greatest Dyson vacuum is the Dyson Gen5detect. This introduces a new motor and battery, offering longer runtimes and greater power (find out more about the differences between Gen5detect and V15 Detect). In 2024, Dyson also launched a non-flagship, more affordable model called the Dyson Digital Slim.\nDyson also has one corded upright model, the Dyson Ball Animal, currently on its third-gen iteration. The other outliers include a robot vacuum called the Dyson 360 Vis Nav, and a wet cleaner called the Dyson WashG1.\nMoving on to Shark, the range is much less straightforward. There are dozens and dozens of models, often sporting very similar names, with models appearing and disappearing on a regular basis. It's fairly common to find that a model will have a different name and product code depending on the country you're in. Shark offers a much broader selection of model types, too: as well as cordless stick vacuums, there are corded stick vacuums, lots of upright vacuums, car vacuums, a range of robot vacuums, and plenty of wet floor cleaners as well.\nI won't get into all your options, because I don't have a spare year, but three of Shark's key ranges are Stratos, Detect Pro and PowerDetect. All have various different types of vacuum in their ranges, but I'll focus on the cordless stick vacuum options.\nStratos is the oldest and least advanced of the three. The Stratos Cordless Stick Vacuum offers powerful suction, but the payoff is that it's a little heavier than the other two. My Shark Detect Pro vs Stratos comparison goes into more depth on the differences.\nThe Detect Pro range is a little newer. The Detect Pro Cordless Stick vacuum is lighter and a little less powerful than the Stratos, but adds a bunch of smart automation features, including the ability to adjust suction when it detects the floor is especially dirty.\nPowerDetect is the newest Shark range at time of writing. The PowerDetect Cordless Stick vacuum is designed to combine the suction power of the Stratos vacs with the smarts of the Detect Pro vacs, and adds a few new features besides. Our Detect Pro vs PowerDetect explainer provides more detail on the differences between those two ranges.\nShark vs Dyson: design & usability\n- Dyson vacuums offer better floorhead maneuverability\n- Most Shark vacuums arrive with a bendable wand for cleaning under furniture\n- Dyson models dock on a wall-mounted charger; Sharks can be stored freestanding\nWhile there will be specific differences between particular models of vacuum you might be considering, there are a few generalizations that can be made regarding the performance and usability of Shark vacuums versus Dyson vacuums.\nLet's start with suction. Shark doesn't release suction specs (and actually, figuring out how much suction a vacuum cleaner has is more complicated than you might imagine), but generally speaking, Dyson vacuums tend to have a more powerful maximum suction mode than Shark models, especially at the top end of the range.\nHowever, on test, we've generally been very impressed with the cleaning power offered by both brands. Most Shark and Dyson vacuums we've tested have performed well in our cleaning tests, which include both fine dust and larger debris. For most people, either brand will offer plenty good enough suction for daily cleans. However, if you're dealing with high levels of dirt, you might be better off with a Dyson.\nNow, let's look at maneuverability. Dyson's cordless vacuums really shine here \u2013 the floorhead can pivot smoothly any which way, easily moving around furniture and getting into nooks and crannies without issue.\nShark's cordless stick vacuums offer decent maneuverability, but fall short of being as nimble as those from Dyson. However, one area where Shark holds the trump card is with its flexible wands. Most Shark stick vacuums feature a button on the back of the wand, which, when pressed, allows the wand to fold forward. This enables you to vacuum easily under furniture, without having to get down on the floor yourself.\nShark refers to this as MultiFLEX / Flexology \u2013 one of many confusing bits of brand jargon that you'll need to navigate on your shopping journey. This Shark vacuum technologies guide should help you decipher things.\nNote: Dyson now sells an accessory that adds very similar functionality to its own stick vacuums. Find out more in my Dyson vacuum tools guide.\nA benefit of this foldable design is that it enables most of Shark's cordless vacuums to be stored freestanding when they're not in use, seeing the wand released and the motor and heandle folding down next to the floorhead. In contrast, Dyson cordless vacuums are designed to be stored on a wall-mounted charging dock.\nA minor downside to Shark's freestanding solution is that it requires the floorhead to lock in place at a right angle to the vacuum wand. It's easy to release by pressing gently on the floorhead with your foot, but can sometimes catch in the lock position during vacuuming, which is a little annoying. In contrast, Dyson's floorheads just hang loose from the end of the wand.\nBoth Dyson and Shark\u2019s cordless models can be converted into handheld vacuums by removing the wand, and both arrive with a range of tools for detail cleaning tasks. The exact tools included will vary depending on the model and iteration, but we've been especially impressed with Dyson's options, which include a fluffy floorhead designed especially for hard floors, and a hair-screw tool for pulling hair from furniture.\nSpeaking of which, anyone who has long hair, or lives with someone who does, will know how quickly it can build up on the brushroll of a vacuum's floorhead. Both Shark and Dyson have taken steps in the design of their models to counter this and encourage hair straight into the bin. On test, we've been impressed with both brands' anti-hair wrap technologies.\nShark vs Dyson: controls\n- Newer Dyson models feature an LCD screen that provides complex information\n- Shark vacuum controls tend to be more basic\nOlder options from both brands are operated using a trigger the needs to be continuously depressed while vacuuming, and both have changed to one-press buttons or switches in their newer models. The latter approach is much more comfortable when vacuuming for longer periods.\nShark vacuums tend to use indicator lights or illuminated icons to relay information about power mode or battery life to the user. It's a similar situation with older Dyson models (the V8 and V10); but if you opt for a V11 or later, there's an LCD screen that can display more detailed info. For instance, it will indicate in words/numbers exactly how long you have left in the current battery mode, and it prompt if any maintenance tasks are required. This screen is also used for real-time dust stats, but I'll get into that in the \"Special features\" section.\nShark vs Dyson: battery life\n- Battery life broadly in line: 40 mins for basic models, 60 mins for premium\n- Dyson Gen5detect has a maximum runtime of 70 minutes\nSpecs for maximum battery life are based on use in the lowest power mode, and specifics vary by model. Broadly speaking, though, Shark and Dyson are roughly in line here. The older or cheaper options in each brand's lineup will top out at around 40 minutes (still a decent amount of cleaning time), while more advanced Shark and Dyson vacuums offer a full hour from a single charge. However, the newest Dyson Gen5detect delivers a maximum of 70 minutes \u2013 that's the longest battery life I've seen from any brand.\nThis isn't without a payoff, though: the motor/battery part of the Gen5detect is noticeably heavy for a cordless stick vacuum. Also bear in mind that one vacuum's lowest power mode isn't necessarily the same as another's in terms of suction. In boost/max modes, you can expect the battery to drain significantly faster on models from both brands.\nIf you're looking at the upper end of both ranges, both have \"Auto\" modes designed to intelligently adjust suction based on dirt levels (and other things) in order to deliver the most battery-efficient clean (more on this in the next section). Runtimes will naturally vary in this mode.\nBoth Dyson and Shark cordless vacuums tend to have swappable batteries, meaning you can purchase a backup and hot-swap to extend battery life if you wish. One benefit of Dyson over Shark is that if you pick a newer model, it will spell out exactly how much cleaning time you have left in the current battery mode. With Shark, you're relying on indicator lights.\nShark vs Dyson: special features\n- Both can adjust suction based on the level of dirt on the floor\n- Dyson has better floorhead headlights, and real-time dirt data\n- Shark has an optional auto-empty dock and odor neutralizer puck\nBeyond standard cleaning power, the newer Shark and Dyson models also have several special features, the kind that you might not expect from a regular vacuum. In this section, I'm mostly talking about the Shark Detect Pro and PowerDetect cordless stick vacuums, and the Dyson V15 Detect and Gen5detect. Specifics vary by model, so double-check what's included before you buy.\nPerhaps the most useful special feature is automatic suction adjustment. Both brands have an \"Auto\" mode that will increase or decrease suction based on how much dirt the vacuum detects on the floor, and whether it's being used on a hard floor or carpet. This means a low-effort cleaning session that maximizes battery life while still ensuring clean floors.\nDyson takes a slightly techier route with its automatic adjustment: it records particle volume and size, and provides real-time reports via the vacuum's control screen, as well as a summary once you're done. This is potentially interesting from a data point of view, but also helps you do a more thorough job. You can watch for the numbers to stabilize on the screen, at which point you can be sure that a particular patch of floor is clean and then move on. This feature is only available when using the main Digital Motorbar floorhead (not the fluffy one for hard floors), because that's the one to feature the sensors.\nShark's most advanced vacuums won't report back on what they're sucking up, but they do have a range of extra detection properties that aren't offered by Dyson. For example, as well as making adjustments based on floor type and dirt levels, they can sense when they're cleaning near the edge of a room, where dust can gather, and amp up suction on the relevant side of the floorhead in response. They can also brighten or dim their headlamps depending on light levels in the area being cleaned.\nTalking of which... On paper, the headlamps on both the Shark and Dyson sound similar, but they're actually quite different.\nShark vacuums feature basic LED lights on their main floorhead that help brighten the path directly in front of the vacuum. Dyson's lights appear on its \"detect\" models, taking the form of a precisely angled beam of laser light \u2013 the kind that's safe for humans and animal eyes \u2013 designed to illuminate hidden dust on hard floors. The laser on the Gen5detect is brighter than that found on the V15 Detect, but both are significantly brighter than Shark vacuum headlamps.\nThis laser is only found on the soft floorhead that's designed specifically for hard floors (called the \"Laser Fluffy\" floorhead). It doesn't appear on the main Motorbar floorhead, and as such can't be used in conjunction with the automatic suction adjustment mode.\nShark has a couple of extra, unique features. With its newest vacuums, there's the option of adding an auto-empty base. The idea is borrowed from robot vacuums, and is essentially a dock that features a larger dust bin. With the vacuum sitting on the dock, all the dust and debris whooshes out of the small onboard bin, through a sealed system and into the base. As well as saving on effort, it might be a particularly good choice for those who suffer from allergies because it means far less frequent manual emptying, and fewer chances for allergens to escape back into the air. This dock also charges the vacuum and provides somewhere to store it.\nAnother special feature that I haven't seen anywhere is an an odor-neutralizing puck. This sits either in the floorhead or the auto-empty base, and is designed to stop the buildup of nasty odors \u2013 for example, if you're vacuuming up a lot of dog hair on a regular basis. You can twist the puck to increase or decrease the neutralization levels. Contrary to popular belief, this isn't designed to introduce an new scent into the air; just remove existing, bad smells. Many reviewers are big fans of this addition, but a handful think it's a pointless gimmick.\nShark vs Dyson: price\n- Generally, Shark vacuums are cheaper than Dyson vacuums\n- Shark pricing is far less stable, so value for money varies\nUsing cordless stick vacuums for comparison, let's look at how the two brands match up for price.\nThe oldest and cheapest model in the Dyson cordless vacuum lineup is the V8, which comes with a list price of $469.99 / \u00a3320 / AU$799 \u2013 although, at time of writing, could be found discounted everywhere to $329.99 / \u00a3229 / AU$499. The newest and priciest Dyson cordless vacuum is the Gen5detect, which costs $949.99 / \u00a3769.99 / AU$1,599 at list price. Dyson vacuum sales are more common than you might think, and there are always some decent price drops in the Black Friday Dyson deals.\nShark's pricing is far more variable: the options change pretty regularly, as do the names and list prices for existing products. Discounts are offered regularly, and don't always follow the expected patterns.\nAs an example, let's look at the Detect Pro, which is the second-newest model in the Shark range. At time of writing, the vacuum-only model (without auto-empty base) has a list price of $379.99 / \u00a3349.99 / AU$599.99. In the US, that's reduced to $199.99; but it has been out of stock for some time. In the UK, it's down to \u00a3199.99, making it pretty much the cheapest cordless vacuum in the lineup, and in Australia it's full price (but the list price has dropped from the original $799.99). You see what I'm dealing with here.\nHowever, broadly speaking, Shark vacuums tend to be cheaper than Dyson models, particularly when shopping at the top end of the range. Dyson's most expensive vacuums are significantly more expensive than Shark's most expensive vacuums. The Black Friday sales are a good time to shop, but it is actually possible to find deals pretty much year-round.\nDyson vs Shark vacuums: which should you buy?\nBuy a Dyson vacuum if...\nYou want maximum maneuverability\nDyson makes the most nimble stick vacs on the market. Its floorheads can pivot every which way, smoothly and with minimal effort.\nYou want the most efficient option\nDyson is all about the engineering, and it has been making vacuums for so long that its basic design has been honed to perfection. In terms of outright suction, battery efficiency and particle filtering, this is the brand to choose.\nYou want hi-tech features\nIn terms of its special features, Dyson tends to lean towards the techy. An LCD screen that provides specific usage information? Real-time dust reports as you clean? You won't find these features at Shark.\nBuy a Shark vacuum if...\nYou're on a tighter budget\nTypically, Shark vacuums are more affordable than Dyson models. Prices are pretty variable and there are some excellent deals to be had if you buy at the right time, too.\nYou want an auto-empty base\nThis brand's newest vacuums come with an optional auto-empty base, to prevent you from having to manually empty the smaller onboard dust bin. This might be especially beneficial for those who suffer allergies.\nYou want something other than a cordless stick vac\nShark makes a wide range of vacuum types, including corded stick vacuums, lots of upright models, handhelds, and a selection of robot vacuums, too. Dyson's focus is much more on cordless stick vacuums.\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "Vacuum cleaners aren't just nice to have: they're essential to maintaining a clean and hygienic home. But the best vacuum cleaners do cost quite a bit of money.\nIt's worth knowing how long they're likely to last, then, so you can budget for a replacement. After all, you don't want to spend weeks on your hands and knees with a dustpan and brush while you wait to save the cash for a new one.\nEstimates for how long a vacuum cleaner will last ranges from just three years right up to eight years.\nSophie Lane, product training manager at Miele GB, says: \"The lifespan of a vacuum cleaner depends on its type and how frequently it\u2019s used, but most vacuums should last at least 10 years.\"\nSurvey data from Consumer Reports in 2016 found that vacuums tended to last for an average of eight years. However, vacuum tech has changed a lot since then. It seems likely that both figures are for corded vacuums, which tend to have a much longer lifespan than cordless ones.\nHow long should a vacuum cleaner last?\nThe projected lifespan varies massively for different types of cleaner. Here's roughly how long experts suggest each type of vacuum might last:\n- Cordless stick vacuums: 3-5 years\n- Corded vacuums: 8-10 years\n- Robot vacuums: 4-7 seven years\nThis isn't a perfect system \u2013 the quality of cleaner and how much you pay for it will factor in (even today's best cheap vacuums are likely to have a shorter lifespan than pricier, premium models), as will how you use and care for your vacuum. Lane points out that Miele's corded vacuums are tested for a lifespan of 20 years, for example. So let's take a look at those numbers in more detail...\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLifespan of corded vs cordless vacuums\nIs your vacuum corded or cordless? Corded types typically have a longer lifespan compared to their cordless counterparts, due to their more robust motors and the absence of battery-related issues.\nEven the best cordless vacuum, then, will generally have a shorter lifespan than a corded one. Home improvement experts Tooling Ideas estimate that a well-maintained cordless vacuum should last from three to five years. That's largely because the battery tends to degrade over time and with frequent use.\nThat said, many cordless models now come with replaceable batteries, which can significantly extend the vacuum's useful life.\nLifespan of upright vs stick vacuums\nUpright vacuums are known for their durability, robust build and powerful motors. And because of all these things, they generally last longer than stick vacuums, which are lighter and more compact.\nGizmo Cleaning, a resource for cleaning information, estimates that a well-maintained stick vacuum can last anywhere from three to five years. That said, technological advancements are continually improving the durability of stick vacuums, so these averages may well change over time.\nLifespan of robot vacuums\nWhat of robot vacuums: how long do can you expect them to keep going? Smart home robotics specialist Ecovacs estimates that a well-maintained robotic vacuum cleaner can last between four and seven years. That said, like smartphones and other tech, you may be tempted to upgrade before that anyway, as this field is rapidly evolving and newer models are likely to have vastly improved features and capabilities, even a couple of years down the line.\nA disclaimer: These estimates are very broad-brush, and don't take account of the wide variation of products with the same category. In general, it's likely the more you pay for a vacuum cleaner, the more well built it'll be and the longer it should last. But that's not always the case, so it's worth check out our in-depth reviews of specific models to see how they match up.\nWarranty periods\nAnother thing to look at when trying to figure out how long a vacuum will last is the warranty a specific model comes with. This typically ranges between one and five years.\nYou'll notice high-end models usually come with longer warranties, and this is a sign of the confidence their manufacturers have in their durability. At the same time, it's important to note that vacuums should last well beyond their warranty period with proper care and maintenance.\nSo next, let's look at what that looks like in practice.\nHow to increase your vacuum's lifespan\n\"Factors that influence a vacuum's longevity include frequency of use \u2013 heavier usage can wear out components more quickly \u2013 and maintenance, such as regularly changing filters, cleaning brushes, and emptying bags or canisters,\" says Lane.\nSo what can you do to keep your vacuum sucking effectively for the longest time? As Tracey Scully, UK managing director at SharkNinja, explains: \"There are easy steps you can take to increase the lifespan of your vacuum and ensure its cleaning power is kept at its optimal level. We recommend regularly emptying your dust cap, ideally after each clean, as well as consistently checking for blockages in the base, hose and airways. To maintain your vacuum's optimal functionality, it's also really important to carefully clean your filters and your brush rolls.\"\nThese simple steps can significantly extend your vacuum's life and maintain its performance. For more on this, read our article on How to clean a vacuum.\nMany leading vacuum brands \u2013 including Shark and Dyson \u2013 have introduced anti hair-wrap tech to their floorheads. These are designed to direct hair straight into the dust cup rather than allowing it to tangle around the rollers, and lowering the maintenance requirement from you.\nReplacement parts and repair services\nHowever well you clean and maintain your vacuum, components will eventually break down. But that needn't mean the end.\nFirst of all, you may be able to repair your vacuum yourself. To get started, check the troubleshooting guide in the manual, and read our articles on Why is my vacuum cleaner not vacuuming? and How to fix a vacuum cleaner with no suction.\nSecondly, major vacuum brands usually offer replacement parts and repair services, which can considerably extend a vacuum's lifespan. Companies like Dyson, Shark, Miele and Hoover provide spare parts and often have authorized service centers. Some even offer trade-in programs or refurbished models, as a way of promoting sustainability in the industry.\nFinally, think about wear and tear over time. Obviously, that should stop you vacuuming as often as you need to. But as Dyson engineer Geli Lee suggests, it helps to avoid using the highest power settings unless absolutely necessary.\nReferring to Dyson's own models, she advises: \"Use Max or Boost mode sparingly and only for short bursts when tackling tough cleaning tasks. For daily use, stick to Auto, Normal, or Eco mode, as these provide sufficient power while preserving battery life. Also, avoid using the vacuum in extreme temperatures and let the battery fully discharge once a month to help extend its life.\u201d\nTom May is a freelance writer and editor specialising in tech, design and sleep products.

      "text": "Can't decide which Dyson vacuum is right for you? Here are the models I'd recommend for 5 different use cases\nTailored recommendations from a vacuum cleaner expert\nSo you need a new vacuum cleaner and you've decided Dyson is the brand for you. Great choice! Dyson makes some of the very best vacuum cleaners on the market.\nThe next step is to choose one. I've been testing and writing about Dyson vacuums for over a year now, so I know how all the different models compare, but if you don't have that in-depth knowledge, figuring out which vacuum to buy can be tricky \u2013 especially because most of them look very similar.\nThere's no 'best Dyson vacuum' for everyone \u2013 the one you should choose will depend on what you need it for. Below, I'll guide you towards the best options for five different use cases.\nHere's how to choose the right Dyson vacuum for your needs...\nBest for pets\nPet hair is one of the trickiest things to clean up, and especially if you have carpet. You'll need a vacuum with some oomph, which means looking at the pricier end of Dyson's range. The V15 Detect and Gen5detect are the brand's most powerful vacuums, with plenty of suction and battery life to tackle the hairiest of homes. The laser mounted onto the Fluffy floorhead is also great for illuminating hair that might otherwise get missed.\nIf you need something even more powerful, you can't beat a corded upright. The only model in the range is the Ball Animal 3 (just called the Ball Animal in the UK). This has tons of suction power and a dust cup that's large enough to hold a whole cardigan's worth of hair, but it's bulky and heavy.\nWant more info? Head to our guide to the best vacuums for pet hair, or our tips on what to look for in a pet vacuum.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBest for small homes\nIf you only have a small home to keep clean, you'll be able to get away with a vacuum with shorter runtimes. If there are awkward nooks and crannies to clean, you might also want something lightweight, compact and easy to maneuver.\nAn oft-overlooked model in the Dyson lineup is the V12 Detect Slim. It was released at the same time as the V15 Detect, so has many of the same advanced features. That includes two floorhead options, laser illumination, and automatic suction adjustment based on dirt levels. What makes it great for small homes is that all that comes in a far smaller, lighter package. It's also button-operated rather than you having to keep a trigger compressed throughout cleaning.\nIf you don't have such demanding cleaning needs, you could get away with one of Dyson's older, cheaper options for your small home. The Dyson V8 is the second lightest in the lineup (after the V12 Detect Slim), and the most affordable cordless option. If you want slightly more power and a longer runtime, consider upgrading to the Dyson V11 (see how the two compare in my Dyson V8 vs V11 article).\nBest for big homes\nFor larger homes, you'll want a decent runtime, and potentially button operation (to avoid a sore trigger-finger). If you have a large home that includes carpet and/or pets, you might also want to consider the size of the dust cup. (Unfortunately, all these things tend to also mean a heavier vacuum, which isn't ideal.)\nDyson makes a supersized version of its newest vacuum: the Gen5outsize. It has most of the same features as the Gen5detect, but coupled with a larger dust cup and wider floorhead. It's not available in the UK, though.\nFor UK shoppers, the best bet is the regular ol' Gen5detect. It offers the longest runtimes of any Dyson cordless (equalling that of the Outsize version), and it's button-operated for extra comfort over long cleaning periods. There's also a Crevice tool hidden in the wand, enabling you to tackle small tasks without trekking back to your vacuum dock, which could be miles away at the other side of your palatial home.\nA third option to consider is the Dyson WashG1. This isn't actually a vacuum \u2013 you'll still need one of those for your carpets \u2013 it's a dedicated wet cleaner. You'd obviously need to have enough hard floors to justify a separate machine for mopping, but if that's the case, this is an excellent performer.\nIt's comfortable to use and easy to maneuver. The tanks are also much bigger than those you'll find on the V15s Detect Submarine (in fact, it's better all round at wet cleaning \u2013 head to my Dyson V15s Detect Submarine vs WashG1 comparison to find out more).\nPros\n- Scaled-up Gen5\n- Larger dust cup, wider floorhead\n- Button operated\nBest for hard floors\nIf you have mostly hard floors, you can get away with a vacuum that has less suction power. That's because any dust and debris will be resting on the surface, and won't need to be pulled from deep within carpet fibers.\nThat means you have a number of choices. You could get away with an older model like the Dyson V8, which will still have plenty enough suction to cope with hard floor cleaning, but won't break the bank.\nIf you want something more advanced, the V15s Detect Submarine is well worth checking out. It comes with a special Fluffy cleaner head dedicated to hard floors; it's soft all over so won't damage delicate floors, and equipped with a laser that does an incredible job of illuminating even tiny specs of dust. There's also a mopping head for wet cleaning. (The Gen5detect and V15 Detect and have the Fluffy floor head, but no mop head.)\nAnother option is the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which also comes with a laser-equipped Fluffy floor head. It's smaller, lighter and more affordable than the Gen5 or V15/V15s, but the dust cup is titchy.\nIf you're willing to wait, you could opt for the Dyson PencilVac. This ultra-light and ultra-streamlined vacuum is still to be released, but I absolutely loved it when I got a chance to have an early play.\nWant more info? Head to our guide to best vacuums for hard floor, or check out our tips for how to keep hardwood floors clean.\nBest for carpet\nCarpet requires more suction to keep clean, because the dirt won't just be resting on the surface as it would be with hard floors. The floorhead also needs to be able to agitate the carpet fibers to release particles stuck there.\nYou might find that too much suction makes a vacuum difficult to comfortably push on carpet. Dyson has addressed this potential issue by adding a small air intake slider on the floorhead \u2013 you can adjust this to let a little more air in, and make the vacuum easier to push.\nThe best Dyson cordless vacuum for carpet is the Gen5detect, followed by the V15 Detect. They're the newest and highest-specced options, offering the longest runtimes and the most powerful suction (see how they match up in my Gen5detect vs V15 Detect article).\nThey also have sensors that monitor the size and volume of particles being sucked up, and can adjust the power in response, for a low-effort but effective clean. The only other Dyson vac to include this auto-adjustment is the V12 Slim, geared towards small homes.\nIf you want maximum power, and don't mind sacrificing a little maneuverability, you might also want to consider the Ball Animal 3 upright. This would be great for deep-cleaning carpet.\nWant more options?

      "text": "The best upright vacuum 2025: powerful vacuums for deeper cleaning\nTried and tested by experienced reviewers\nIf you need something with supreme suction power for proper deep cleaning, one of today's best best upright vacuum cleaners will often be the best tool for the job. Upright vacuums tend to offer far more outright power than cordless stick vacuums, and they typically come with generous sized dirt canisters and larger cleaner heads, for bigger cleaning tasks. The fact they're generally corded means you'll never run out of juice \u2013 and they should last a good, long time too.\nAt TechRadar, we've been testing vacuum cleaners for the past nine years. During that time we've reviewer over 185 different models, including 41 new vacuums last year. To earn its place in our guide, each upright here has been put through its paces by an experienced reviewer. We run standardized suction tests, as well as assessing how well each vacuum performs on a range of floor types, how easy and comfortable they are to use, and whether they deliver good value for money.\nIf you need something lightweight and easy to maneuver, and don't mind sacrificing a bit of power for that convenience, you're better off with one of the best cordless vacuums. And if you're undecided, our general best vacuum cleaner ranking will walk you though all your various options. But if you've decided an upright is the vacuum for you, read on for our top picks.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nBest for most people\nPacked with essential features including Anti Hair Wrap and odor control plus a powered lift-away mode, this is an outstanding all-rounder.\nGreat price\nBest affordable\nAffordably priced (and heavily discounted these days), the Hoover HL5 delivers strong suction and a decent featureset for its low price, but it is heavy and loud.\nSuper suction\nBest for pets\nDesigned with pet hair in mind, the Dyson Ball Animal is really maneuverable with terrific suction, but it's the heaviest option on our list.\nLightweight\nBest compact\nThis straightforward freestanding vacuum is far lighter and more maneuverable than most uprights, and its cordless too. Don't expect a massive dust cup, though.\nWet & dry\nBest vacuum and mop\nFor keeping hard floors clean, this cordless upright is a fine option. It mops and vacuums and it's self-propelling, although battery life is short.\nThe best upright vacuums 2025: tried and tested\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best upright vacuum for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want versatility: The bin section can be removed and the cleaner head used on the end of a flexible wand, making this suitable for more awkward spaces.\n\u2705 You have a pet: This vacuum has an anti-odor puck designed to stop bad smells building up from the dust canister.\n\u274c You want a longer cord: The cord here is about standard length, but if you want more maneuvering room, the Dyson at #6 gives you a couple of extra meters.\n\u274c You want a bigger bin: Again, the bin is about standard size, but the Dyson #6 has a bigger one.\nThe best upright vacuum we've tested so far is the Shark Stratos Pet Pro Upright Vacuum. This is a UK-only model, but there are very similar models in the US (AZ3002) and Australia (AZ913). It has an impressively versatile design that can be used in a number of configurations for different cleaning tasks. The dust canister can be lifted off and held in the hand, enabling you to vacuum high-up or awkward spaces \u2013 like stairs \u2013 with the flexible hose.\nIt borrows many of the same features from today's best Shark cordless vacuums. The DuoClean floorhead is designed to work equally well on hard floor and carpet, and it has anti-hair wrap features so you won't need to manually clear matted hair from the rollers after every clean.\nOn which note, our tester found this vacuum did a great job of pulling hair from carpet, and it comes with an anti-odor puck designed to prevent bad smells from building up in the dust canister. All of that means it's well worth considering if you're a pet owner (although our favorite pick for pet hair is the Dyson at #4).\nOn test, our reviewer had very few complaints about this model, although one minor quibble was that the cord could be a touch longer. At 8 meters, it's about standard length, but some brands do occasionally give you a bit more cable to play with (specifically the Dyson at #4).\nRead more: Shark Stratos Upright Vacuum review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Versatile, with lots of thoughtful design tweaks. However, bulky and heavy. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Excellent cleaning performance on all surfaces. Sucks up pet hair and dust with ease. | 5 / 5 |\nValue | Fairly priced and very goo build quality. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best budget upright vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want versatility: Like other models here, it's possible to use the wand on the end of a flexible hose, to tackle awkward spaces.\n\u2705 You're on a budget: This vacuum comes with a very wallet-friendly price tag, and these days it's regularly discounted further.\n\u274c You want something easy to move about: We found the bin could pull away when used to lift this vacuum.\n\u274c You want something reasonably quiet: No vacuum is especially quiet, but this is one of the loudest we've tested.\nIf you're in the UK the best budget upright vacuum you can get is the Hoover HL5, which is affordable even at full price, but these days is regularly heavily discounted further. It comes in a standard spec, which is the model we reviewed, and a pet version that comes with a motorized pet tool. If looks are important to you, the Pets edition is available in a yellow/blue colorway, whereas this Homes edition is in a grey/red. Performance-wise there's no difference between the two.\nThe HL5 comes fully loaded with the features we look for in pricier models, including an Anti-Twist brush bar which genuinely didn't get any hair wrapped around it during our testing period, even in a household full on long-haired humans, and headlamps on the floorhead to help you see dirt in dingy corners. Like a few of the upright vacuums here, there's a flexible tube onto which detail tools can be added for cleaning up high or under furniture.\nIt's not the highest quality upright here, but it is good for the price. There were a few more downsides we uncovered during our tests: it's loud in use, and while it's not especially heavy compared to the other models in this list, it's a little hard to maneuver around given the bin can lift off when you try to pick it up.\nRead more: Hoover HL5 Push&Lift Upright Vacuum Cleaner review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Lots of useful features, but the bin lifts off too easily. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Excellent suction and great for floors, but vacuuming stairs is tricky. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | Competitively priced and good value for the quality of product. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best upright vacuum for pet hair\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best suction: This upright vacuum is ultra-powerful and makes light work of pulling pet hair from carpet.\n\u2705 You need a big bin: This model has the largest bin of any vacuum here, so you can get plenty of cleaning in without having to empty it.\n\u274c You want something not too heavy: This model is very weighty and difficult to shift about.\n\u274c You need to get into awkward spaces: The flex hose here isn't as flexible as we'd like.\nThe Dyson Ball Animal (called the Ball Animal 3 in some territories) is the best upright vacuum for pet hair. Our tester has two 'crazy-hairy' spaniels and invited a heavily molting Labrador over for a sleepover during their review period, and the Ball Animal cleared up all traces of shedding with no issues at all. The powered main floorhead is outstanding at pulling up hair from carpets, and a very effective tangle-free turbine tool tackles any stuck on furniture and between sofa cushions. The massive bin capacity also means you won't be traipsing to and from the trash can too often, too.\nOn test, we were also extremely impressed with the overall suction offered by this model. It aced our tests with large and small debris, requiring just a single pass to pick up both kinds of spillage on carpet. However, it didn't perform so well on hard floors, pinging around the oats rather than picking them up.\nAs is the case with all of today's best Dyson vacuums, the maneuverability of the floorhead is outstanding \u2013 it can pivot every which way, and get into any corner or crevice. However, overall this is a very cumbersome and heavy cleaner. Those used to lightweight stick vacuums will find it quite a departure \u2013 you'll find alternative recommendations in our dedicated guide to the best vacuums for pet hair.\nRead more: Dyson Ball Animal review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Well designed with a generous dust cup, but very heavy and the flex hose could be more flexible. | 3 / 5 |\nPerformance | Extremely good suction, but hard work to push around. | 3.5 / 5 |\nValue | Cheap compared to Dyson's cordless vacuums. Feels high quality and you get a lot of power for your money. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best compact upright vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want something maneuverable: This is far lighter and easier to drive about than most upright vacuums \u2013 and it's cordless, too.\n\u2705 Your home is on one floor: There's no flexible tube or detail tools here, so this isn't the best for stairs. It's great at cleaning the edges of rooms, though.\n\u274c You want maximum power: Although this vacuum performed well in our suction tests, 'true' corded uprights will almost always have more power than a cordless vacuum.\n\u274c You need a large dust cup: At 0.8L, the dust cup on this vacuum is far smaller than most uprights.\nThe Gtech AirRam 3 is a bit of an outlier, because the design that falls somewhere between an upright and a stick vacuum. But given that it stands up on its own and can't be pulled apart, we think it's most like a streamlined, lightweight upright vacuum; if that appeals to you, then read on.\nUnlike most of the models on this list, the Gtech AirRam 3 is cordless, so you won't end up tethered to a wall. It's also relatively lightweight, and because all the weight is in the base, it's more comfortable to use for long periods than your average stick vacuum. The floorhead will also help propel the machine forwards in use.\nThe design is straightforward \u2013 there's no bendy hose, it can't be reconfigured for use in handheld mode, and there are no detail tools. Our tester was a big fan of this no-frills, function-first approach, but it is probably best suited to those who live on one floor, as it won't be great at handling stairs. What is is good at handling is edges. That's because it comes with spinning edge brushes, which sweep dust and debris into the cleaner's suction path.\nIn fact, the AirRam 3 performed well in all our suction tests, although do bear in mind that for maximum suction power, you'd really be better off with a bulkier, corded model. The dust cup is relatively small, and sized more like those on a stick vacuum than what you'd expect on an upright, which is something to be aware of if you're regularly dealing with lots of dust or pet hair.\nRead the full Gtech AirRam 3 review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Far more compact than a traditional upright, with a smaller dust cup and height-adjustable handle. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Excellent cleaning powers, although lacks detail tools. Comfortable to use as most weight is near the ground. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | Between mid-range and premium price brackets, but high build quality. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best upright vacuum and mob combo\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to give hard floors a proper clean: This wet-dry cleaner is excellent at tackling hard floors.\n\u2705 You're dealing with lots of dirt and debris: It's a more heavy-duty option that not only mops but also deodorizes and disinfects.\n\u274c You need something for carpet: This vacuum can't be used on carpet.\n\u274c You're mainly just dealing with dust: It's probably overkill if you just need something for a light clean.\nThis is a little different from the other upright vacuums in our list \u2013 it's a wet-dry cleaner (in fact, the best wet dry vacuum we've tested). If you really want to keep your hard floors clean, then the Tineco Floor One S7 Pro is your best option. It both vacuums and mops, and it'll disinfect and deodorize at the same time.\nIt's a super-heavy model, weighing in at 21.5lbs / 9.76kg, but it's not a struggle to use as it's self-propelling and it'll glide across your floor with ease. The downside to this a a short battery life; at best you'll get 40 minutes out of one charge. It's also worth noting that there's no bin on this because there's no vacuum-only mode, and instead there's a clean water tank and a dirty water tank; you'll need to refill the first as well as emptying and rinsing the second on a regular basis.\nThe Floor One S7 Pro has an effective self-cleaning system, as well as voice prompts and an LED display, but what really matters is just how well it cleans. This one might not be cheap, but if you're tired of vacuuming and washing your hard floors separately, you'll almost certainly find it's worth the investment. It can't be used on carpet, though.\nRead more: Tineco Floor One S7 Pro review\nAttribute | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Compact and lightweight for a wet-dry vacuum, with useful information screen. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Efficiently sucks up dirt, debris and hair, and its special features work reliably. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | Not cheap, but decent value for what you're getting. | 4 / 5 |\nHow we test upright vacuums\n\u2705 Over 185 vacuums and robot vacuums tested in total\n\u2705 ... including 41 new vacuums reviewed in 2024\n\u2705 9 years of vacuum testing experience\nBefore it can appear in this guide, each upright vacuum undergoes a vigorous testing process. Here's a quick run-down of what that involves:\nSuction tests\nOur reviewers try out each vacuum on spillages of different kinds. So we spill fine dust (biscuit crumbs and flour) on the floor and see how thoroughly it cleans it, on each suction mode. We then repeat the test for dry oats, to see how it copes with larger debris. Both tests are run on hard floor and on carpet.\nTesters will also use the vacuum as their regular cleaner for a couple of weeks or more, to get a feel for how it performs in real-world scenarios. During this time, we focus particularly on how well the vacuum copes with hair (pet and human) and how versatile it is for different cleaning tasks.\nUsability tests\nWe assess how comfortable the vacuum is to use, how easily it can be maneuvered into different spots in the house, and if the cord is long enough to allow for general cleaning tasks. We consider how easy it is to put together and swap attachments, as well as trying out any included tools to see how effectively they do the job they were designed for.\nWe rate each model on how simple it is to empty the dust canister, how loud it is during use, and how durable it is. In addition, for cordless models (rare for upright vacuums), we record how long they last in each power mode, and how long they take to recharge.\nRead more on how we test vacuum cleaners.\nThe best upright vacuums: specs compared\nModel | Weight | Bin size | Cord length |\n|---|---|---|---|\nShark Stratos Upright | 6.7kg | 1.3L | 8m |\nHoover HL5 Push&Lift Upright | 6.4kg | 1.4L | 8m |\nDyson Ball Animal 3 | 7kg | 1.7L | 10m |\nGtech AirRam 3 | 3.8kg | 0.8L | N/A |\nTineco Floor One S7 Pro Wet-dry vacuum | 9.8kg | 0.9L (clean water), 0.7L (dirty water) | N/A |\nTested by\nAll the upright vacuums in this ranking have been rigorously tested, either by one of the TechRadar Homes team or an experienced reviewer. Meet some of the expert reviewers who put these vacuums through their paces.\nJenny is now the editor of Top Ten Reviews, but prior to she was TechRadar's Homes Editor. As part of that role, she tested dozens of vacuum cleaners of all shapes and sizes, trying to find one that could deal with the levels of dust generated by her ongoing home renovation project.\nHelen is a freelance writer who specializes in kitchen and home appliances, and has been testing vacuums since 2008. She has reviewed well over 100 different models, from the likes of Shark, Dyson and more. Although her preference is for a lightweight, maneuverable vacuum, she appreciates the extra suction power you get with an upright model.\nBest upright vacuum FAQs\nWhat to consider when buying an upright vacuum\nThere\u2019s a range of upright models to choose from, which may leave you confused when selecting the right one for you. However, if you focus on these considerations, you\u2019ll quickly be able to identify the model that\u2019s best suited to you.\nStart by deciding whether you want a corded or cordless upright vacuum. Those that rely on electrical sockets often have larger dust canisters and wide cleaning heads than cordless models, which means you can vacuum sessions will be completed quickly. However, they\u2019re also heavier than the best cordless vacuums, which may be a problem when punching one around your floors. In addition, depending on how long the cable is, you cannot reach certain parts of your home without unplugging the vacuum and moving it to a closer electrical socket.\nIf you\u2019ve opted for a cordless upright vacuum cleaner, check how long the battery will last between charges and whether it\u2019s swappable. If the battery runs out of power mid-clean, you don\u2019t have to wait for the vacuum to recharge before you can carry on.\nIf you have hard floors, look for an upright vacuum with different floor modes, which see the brush roller switched off, so it doesn\u2019t damage the flooring, or for models that come with an additional cleaning head featuring a softer brush roll designed for this purpose.\nAlso, check the vacuum will be able to reach under furniture and in any tight spaces, you have in your home to ensure you\u2019re thoroughly cleaning your floors every time you push a vacuum around.\nIf you\u2019re still unsure, read our advice on which type of vacuum should you buy?\nWhat's the difference between a stick and an upright vacuum?\nA stick vacuum has the motor, dust canister, controls and handle at the top. A long wand is attached, with a floorhead at the bottom. Generally, they have a modular design where the wand can be removed and a detail tool attached, enabling the machine to be used as a handheld vacuum.\nUpright vacuums are larger and freestanding, with the floorhead attached to the main machine, and a large dust canister between that and the handle. Sometimes, there's also a flexible hose and detail tools for tackling areas above the ground.\nStick are typically lighter and easier to maneuver. Most modern options are cordless, so you won't be tethered to a power outlet. Uprights are bulkier and heavier, and you'll generally have a cable to deal with. However, they're almost always more powerful than a stick vacuum, and better for deep cleans thanks to a larger dust cup. They're also generally much more durable (here's more on how long your vacuum should last).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "Forget Shark and Dyson \u2013 this budget-friendly vacuum is just as good, and incredible value for money\nDreame by name, dreamy by nature\nWhen most people think about vacuum cleaners, the brands that tend to come to mind are Dyson or Shark. But one vacuum cleaner blew us away this year, and it didn't come from either of them. Instead, it's a Dreame vacuum; specifically the R20.\nThis is one of the very best cordless vacuums we've tested, easily rivaling options from far better-known brands, and for a much lower cost too. We gave it a near-perfect 4.5* in our Dreame R20 vacuum review.\nThe design, features and spec list are impressive: it's ultra-lightweight (thanks to an innovative carbon fiber tube), you'll get a dedicated soft floorhead for delicate floors and there's automatic suction adjustment based on dirt levels \u2013 with information provided via a hi-tech screen.\nThose are all features that are rare in the affordable price bracket, let alone all together in one vacuum. Price-wise, the R20 is $449.99 / \u00a3279 at list price, but discounts are common, so it's unlikely you'll actually have to pay that.\nSpecs aren't everything though, so what about the performance? This Dreame vacuum knocked our tester's socks off with its cleaning powers, and he commented that the suction was \"exceptional for its compact size\".\nIn fact, it's a little too powerful for some thicker carpet \u2013 thankfully, Dreame has included an air intake slider that can be opened to lessen resistance and make it easier to push, with no noticeable compromise in cleaning power. The automatic adjustment works exactly as advertised and means the vacuum can clear spillages with next-to-no effort.\nOur reviewer was equally impressed with the maneuverability; the swiveling floorhead can steer easily around chair legs and into tight corners, and the flexible hose attachment helps amp up versatility, for example for cleaning under furniture and beds.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPerhaps the hardest test for vacuum cleaners is pet hair, but again the Dreame R20 rose to the challenge, pulling almost every last piece of hair from our multiple-pet-owning tester's rug in a single pass. (We rate it amongst the best vacuums for pet hair we've tested.)\nIt's not quite perfect. It makes a slightly annoying whine when working (in any mode) and the trigger is easy to accidentally activate when carrying the vacuum around. Finally, the bin is on the smaller side, so if you have a very large house you might find yourself emptying it annoyingly often. Other than that, though, it's an incredible all-rounder.\nIn fact, Dreame is one to watch in the home appliances space in general. As well as vacuums, the brand also makes robot vacuums, hair dryers, hair stylers, wet-and-dry vacuums and, recently, a lawnbot too. We've tested examples from each category and generally been very impressed.\nYou might also like...\n- Are Dyson vacuums worth the premium price?

      "text": "The best cordless vacuum 2025: tested and recommended by experts\nThese were the stick vacuums that came out on top in our tests\nWith one of the best cordless vacuums you can clean all around your home without getting tangled in a power cord or having to constantly swap between outlets. While going cordless used to mean poor suction, short cleaning times and long waits for the battery to recharge, cordless vacuum technologies have improved massively over the past few years. Today's top models offer strong suction and impressive battery life, and most of today's best vacuum cleaners on the market are cordless models.\nAt TechRadar, we've tested over 185 vacuum cleaners over the course of nine years, including 41 new models last year. For each review, we assess each model's cleaning power on hard floor and carpet, how well it copes with different kinds of cleaning tasks (including pet hair), as well as things like battery life, comfort of use and maneuverability, effectiveness of any extra tools, and value for money.\nBased on our expertise and testing, the Shark Detect Pro Cordless is the best cordless vacuum for most people. It combines great pickup power with a maneuverable design and some useful smart features, all for a reasonable price tag. However, it won't be perfect for everyone, so this guide also includes a range of alternatives for different needs and budgets.\nQuick list\nBest buy\nBest overall\nThe R20 is the full package, for a very affordable price.

She's spent the past 15 months focusing on home appliances, and vacuum cleaners of all kinds in particular.\n3 July: The Dreame D20 has been shifted into the #1 spot. Previously, the Shark Detect Pro held this position, but it's increasingly hard to get hold of the version without the auto-empty base.\nThe best cordless vacuum cleaner for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a maneuverable vacuum: A lightweight carbon-fiber wand mean this vac is nice and nimble, plus the wand bends forwards to 90-degrees for cleaning under furniture.\n\u2705 You have delicate hard floor: This vacuum comes with a dedicated soft floorhead for hard floors you're worried about scratching up.\n\u274c You'd prefer button operation: The R20 is trigger-operated \u2013 although there is a button to activate continuous running if you need it.\n\u274c You'd like an auto-empty base: The Detect Pro at #4 has an auto-empty base; that's not an option here.\nThe Dreame R20 is the best cordless vacuum for most people \u2013 as well as being one of the very best vacuums of any kind we've tested. You might not immediately recognize the brand name, but we've consistently been impressed when testing Dreame's appliances \u2013 it's definitely one to watch. On test, we found the suction performance was superb, offering reliable cleaning on carpet and hard floor, and tackling large debris, fine dust, and sticky pet hair without issue.\nThis is one of the best-value vacuums on the market, sitting near the bottom of the mid-range bracket and punching well above its affordable price tag, with features you wouldn't expect at this price point. A case in point is the Auto mode, where the vacuum ramps up power when it senses the floor is especially dusty and lowers it when there's less dirt about. The (pricier) Dyson at #3 and Shark at #4 all offer slightly more advanced automation features, but the Dreame version of the tech will work just fine for most people.\nThere's a wide selection of attachments to amp up the versatility. That includes a dedicated fluffy floorhead for delicate hard floors (again generally not something that's included at this price point), and a mini motorized tool for cleaning furniture.\nAn innovative carbon fiber wand helps keep the weight right down, and it's easy to maneuver, with a wand that can bend forward to 90-degrees for cleaning under furniture. It's trigger-operated, and said trigger is a little too easy to activate accidentally, although that's not a major issue. At least Dreame has thought to provide a switch to activate continual running, so you don't end up with a tired finger if you're cleaning the whole house. We were surprised to note there's not really a low-powered mode for when you want to preserve battery, although the runtimes are so long that you might not need one.\nOverall, if you're after a very capable cleaner with helpful added features, all for an affordable price, the Dreame R20 is hard to beat.\nRead more: Dreame R20 cordless vacuum review\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Ultra-light wand, ergonomic to hold, looks modern. Trigger-operated, but can be switched to continuous. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Superb suction, easy to maneuver, and battery life is excellent. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | Lower-mid range, and exceptional value for what you're getting. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best cordless vacuum for pet hair\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have pets: The suction here is excellent for a cordless model, and great for pulling fur out of carpets and furniture.\n\u2705 You need to vacuum under furniture: Like most Shark vacuums, the Stratos has a wand that can bend forwards, so you can vacuum right under furniture without bending down.\n\u274c You have mostly hard floors: The Stratos is heavier and less smart than the Detect Pro (#4), so if you don't need the extra suction, you might prefer that model.\n\u274c You want something light and flexible: This is one of the heaviest options in our roundup.\nThe Shark Stratos is the best cordless vacuum for people with pets. It's heavier and less feature-packed than other models here, but the payoff is more power, which is key if you're trying to pull stubborn pet hair from your carpets. The floorhead has been designed in such a way that it'll funnel hair straight into the dust cup rather than letting it tangle and clog up the rollers \u2013 more useful for long human hair than short pet hair, but still worth noting.\nOne bonus feature is the built-in odor neutralizer puck, which keeps the machine smelling fresh. And while you won't get the dragonfly-like movement possibilities of a Dyson model like #3, it can pivot on the horizontal plane and on test we found it delivered good maneuverability. Our tester was especially impressed with the forward-bending wand, which is great for getting right under furniture.\nThe dust cup is more generously sized than the one on the Shark Detect Pro (#4), so you won't need to be heading to the trash nearly so often. However, unlike that model, there's no compatible self-empty base, so you will need to empty it manually. (If you're on the fence between the two models, our Shark Stratos vs Detect Pro article runs through the differences in detail.)\nWhile making your purchasing decision, it's worth bearing in mind that a corded vacuum (and often even a bulky upright vacuum) will almost always pack more power than a lightweight cordless model. So you'll want to weigh up if your priority is power or usability. Head to our guide to the best vacuums for pet hair for a range of alternatives.\nRead our full Shark Stratos Cordless with Clean Sense IQ IZ862H review\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Rather heavy, but packed with useful features like a forward-folding wand and odor-neutralizing puck. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Powerful suction and easy to maneuver despite being heavier. Good battery life. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | Mid-range at full price but deals are now easy to find and offer strong value for money. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best cordless Dyson vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a hi-tech vacuum: Expect advanced engineering and features you won't find elsewhere, including real-time dust reports as you clean.\n\u2705 You have hard floors: This vacuum comes with a Fluffy floorhead for hard floors, and it's equipped with a laser to illuminate any dust.\n\u274c You want the latest and greatest Dyson: The V15 offers the best cost-to-performance balance, but if you want the very latest smarts and maximum suction, you need the Gen5detect.\n\u274c You're on a tighter budget: It's an excellent machine, but you're paying a little bit more for the Dyson name \u2013 it's worth checking out Shark's range if you want maximum value for money.\nThe best Dyson cordless vacuum is the V15 Detect. (Actually, Dyson did away with cords a while ago, so the full range \u2013 with the exception of the Dyson Ball Animal \u2013 is cordless.) It's not without good reason that this brand is lauded so highly in the vacuum cleaner world \u2013 its cleaners have been meticulously engineered for maximum performance, and it continues to lead the way in terms of innovation too.\nThe V15 Detect is premium quality, meticulously engineered and delivers features that you won't find with any other brand. There's automatic suction adjustment based on dirt levels, but here it's coupled with real-time dust reports \u2013 so the vacuum senses the size and volume of particles being sucked up, and shows you via a colorful, moving graph on its screen. That way, you can see when the bit of floor you're cleaning is debris-free.\nLike the Dreame (#1), this vacuum also comes with a secondary soft floorhead for hard floors. However, here it's fitted with a laser light to highlight dust that might otherwise be missed. (It sits at the top of our best vacuum for hardwood floor ranking.)\nIf you set aside the bells and whistles, this is still an excellent vacuum. On test, we found this cordless vac sailed through all the cleaning tasks we put to it, delivering impressive suction even on the lowest-powered Eco mode. Like the rest of the Dyson range, it's incredibly easy to maneuver, with a floorhead that can pivot any which way you want it. The battery life is excellent, and the screen will spell out exactly how long you have left, so you shouldn't run out of juice unexpectedly. However, it's worth noting that the design is a little top-heavy, so it can feel unwieldy in handheld mode.\nDyson vacs are often expensive, so you'll need to balance how much you want to spend with which features you actually need. This is the second-newest model in the range \u2013 the fanciest and priciest option is the Gen5detect but we felt the V15 offered a better features-to-price ratio. If it's still a little pricey, check out your other options in our ranking of the best Dyson vacuums.\nRead our full Dyson V15 Detect review\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Sleek and well-designed, with features you won't find elsewhere. Can feel top-heavy. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | Excellent suction and auto mode is a big effort-saver. | 4.5 / 5 |\nValue | High price mostly justified by the premium build quality and impressive engineering. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best auto-empty cordless vacuum cleaner\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You suffer from allergies: As well as saving effort, the auto-empty base means there's far fewer chances for dust to escape back into the air.\n\u2705 You have a mix of floor types: The Detect Pro will automatically adjust suction when it senses it's on carpet, for a fuss-free clean.\n\u274c You want maximum suction: If super suction is your priority, the Stratos Cordless (#2) or Halo (#7) are both better picks.\n\u274c You're tight on space: The dock is a little bulky and not especially attractive, and probably not worth it if you have a small home.\nIf you're looking for a low-effort solution, the Shark Detect Pro with Auto-Empty System is a great choice. The USP is that the base: dock your vac and all the dust will whoosh out, via a closed system, into a far larger dustbag in the base. Provided you have space for the base, it's a big effort-saver, and good news for allergy-sufferers too, because there are far fewer chances for dust a debris to escape back into the air.\nThe vacuum itself is very capable too. It's compact and lightweight, and offers an auto mode that responds to dirt levels, and will also amp up suction on the relevant side of the floorhead when it approaches the edge of a room where dust can collect. The suction isn't up there with the likes of the Stratos (#2) or Dyson (#3) but it'll be fine for most people, and especially if you don't have tons of carpet or pet hair to deal with. (If you want the auto-empty but need more suction, check out the Shark PowerDetect Cordless vacuum instead.)\nLike most cordless stick vacuums, the main machine converts easily into a handheld for cleaning furniture and overhead. In terms of extra attachments, they're a little limited, though \u2013 you might get just a Crevice tool, or possibly also a Pet Tool. You used to be able to purchase this vacuum without a base, but it's increasingly hard to get hold of these days \u2013 not to mention often pricier than the version with the base. See how the Detect Pro compares to other models from this brand's range in our guide to the best Shark vacuums.\nRead our full Shark Detect Pro Cordless review\nSection | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign | Lightweight and modern, and auto-empty base is useful if a bit bulky. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Decent power, easy to drive, and automation features work well. Solid runtimes. | 4 / 5 |\nValue | Officially mid-range; can be excellent value if you snag one of the regular deals. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best budget cordless vacuum in the US\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're on a budget: The Roidmi is very affordable and the performance is above what we'd expect for the price. An excellent budget pick.\n\u2705 You don't need fancy features: As you'd expect, it's just the basics here, but three power modes give you decent control over your clean.\n\u274c You live in the UK: The S2 isn't available here \u2013 the Henry (#6) is our favorite budget UK pick.\n\u274c You need to deal with lots of dust or hair: The dustbin is small and messy to empty, so those hoping to tackle larger volumes of dirt should look elsewhere.\nThe Roidmi S2 is our pick for the best budget vacuum around, and it's also a great choice if you're short on space. This stylish, matte white cordless vacuum comes with a thoughtful range of sturdy, well-made accessories. It offers three suction levels, selected via a button on the handle; and even the wall-mounted charging dock is compact and discreet. That makes it a good option for places where space is at a premium.\nThe Roidmi S2 has good suction and maneuverability, but it can be a little noisy to use. And inevitably there's a trade-off because of its small size: it has a small dust container, so you'll need to empty that fairly frequently. It's simple enough but it does mean this probably isn't the vacuum for you if you have a large home, shedding pets, or both.\nDon't pay the full asking price: this vacuum is almost constantly discounted, often by very large amounts. If you can bag this vacuum at a reduced price \u2013 in the region of $175 \u2013 then it's the best cheap vacuum around. If you live in the UK, where the S2 is very hard to find now, check out the Henry Quick (#6) instead.\nRead our full Roidmi S2 cordless vacuum cleaner review\nThe best budget cordless vacuum in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're on a budget: This Henry is affordable, and punches above its price tag when it comes to performance.\n\u2705 You have allergies: The fact this uses bags might be a benefit to those who struggle with allergies, and don't want particles escaping back into the air when emptying.\n\u274c You live in the US: You can find this model in the US, but it's generally pretty expensive. Stateside shoppers should look at the Roidmi at #5, instead.\n\u274c You want something bagless: If you're wary of ongoing costs, or want to see what you've sucked up, the Henry isn't the vacuum for you.\nBrits looking for a bargain cordless vacuum should definitely check out the Henry Quick \u2013 a stick sibling to the iconic (if unwieldy) cylinder vacuum, with the same friendly face (although here it's a bit more awkwardly placed). It delivers outstanding performance for a very affordable price. You can get it in the US, but it's less good value for money there.\nOn test, our reviewer found that the full power setting was on a par with their favorite corded vacuum, and the lowest setting worked brilliantly on hard floors. If you have pets around the home then the Henry Quick will gamely tease the stray hairs with ease from the hard floors, plus upholstery and deep-pile carpets. Since it's bagged, you can just release the bag from the Henry Quick and get on with your day, making it a solid option for allergy-sufferers. The bags have a higher capacity than your standard cordless vacuum, although not as generous as the other bagged model on our list \u2013 the Halo at #7.\nOur only real complaints are that this vacuum can be a little heavy when in use for long periods, and the fact you'll need to shell out for new bags.\nRead our full Numatic Henry Quick review\nThe best cordless vacuum for carpet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want excellent suction: Our experienced tester was extremely impressed with the suction on this vacuum; good news for pet owners, those with lots of carpet, or anyone who just wants to deep clean.\n\u2705 You need decent maneuverability: While not on a part with a Dyson, the floorhead here pivots well, and getting it in and around furniture is straightforward.\n\u274c You want cutting-edge tech: This is one of the more basic options here \u2013 you won't get information screens or automatic suction adjustment.\n\u274c You don't want a bagged machine: Bags represent an ongoing cost, and a little extra fuss. If you want to avoid, there are plenty of excellent bagless options in this list.\nThe Halo Capsule X is our favorite cordless vacuum for carpet, although if you have a mix of floor types, you'll be pleased to hear it's equally effective on hard floors. The slightly quirky design delivers excellent suction and very impressive pickup. It also feels nice and light in the hand, and is comfortable to use and maneuver (although for maximum pivotability, you can't beat a Dyson like #3).\nIt's one of very few bagged vacuums in this list, which might be a deal-breaker for some, although it does have its benefits \u2013 you can use it to suck up fine particles like fireplace ash without ruining the motor, for example. The bags have a massive 2L capacity \u2013 at least double the size of all other models on this list. Although they still represent an ongoing cost, they are made from compostable cardboard and brown paper, so at least you don't need to worry too much about environmental impact.\nHalo promises 60 minutes of cleaning in the lowest power mode, and the battery is swappable so you could get two full hours of power before having to plug in again. As with all cordless vacs, runtimes drop when using more powerful settings, and in our tests, our reviewer managed 25 minutes of cleaning in the medium mode.\nIf you want features like automatic power adjustment look elsewhere in this list, but for pure power that's great for carpet, the Halo Capsule X is a top choice.\nRead our full Halo Capsule X Pet Max review\nThe best cordless vacuum for hard floors\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have hard floors: On test, we were impressed with the pickup on hard floors, as well as finding it comfortable to use and easy to move around.\n\u2705 You have furry friends: The Pet version of this vacuum comes with a mini motorized pet hair brush that's one of the best we've tested.\n\u274c You have carpet: This cordless vacuum didn't offer such good performance on carpet \u2013 consider the Halo (#7) or Stratos (#2) instead.\n\u274c You often have to suck up chunky spillages: There's a roller in the front of the floorhead that sits flush to the floor, making it tricky to pick up larger debris.\nThe Samsung Jet 85 Pet is the best vacuum cleaner for hard floors. Although it's actually one of the heaviest models here, the balance of the design means it feels light in the hand and is comfortable to use, with good maneuverability and excellent pickup power on hard floors. There are four suction modes, and you'll get a decent 44 minutes of cleaning time on the lowest of these. If you really need to break out the big guns, you can unleash the 'Jet' mode this vacuum gets its name from, but our tester found that perhaps a little too powerful.\nThere's a mini motorized pet tool designed for use on upholstery, and we were extremely impressed with how well it worked to get hair out of furniture \u2013 it's easily as good as the equivalent tool from Dyson. However, we weren't so impressed with the performance of the main vacuum cleaner on carpet, so if you have a mix of floor types in your home then you'd be better off with something like the Dreame (#1). Unfortunately, it's also currently not available in the US.\nRead our full Samsung Jet 85 Pet vacuum cleaner review\nThe best cordless handheld vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a powerful handheld: The suction here is great for a handheld vacuum.\n\u2705 You want something versatile: This vacuum comes with a range of tools for different tasks, meaning it can tackle different kinds of cleanup tasks.\n\u274c You want to be able to clean the floor: Most vacuums here convert into handheld models \u2013 of them all, the Roidmi (#5) and Halo (#8) are the lightest in weight.\n\u274c You want to clean for a long time: The battery life here is okay, but the battery isn't swappable, so you'll need to wait for it to recharge if you want longer.\nThe Shark UltraCyclone Pet Pro+ (or the Shark Classic Handheld Pet Vacuum CH950UKT in the UK) is a different kind of thing than. While many of today's best cordless vacuums can be transformed into a handheld model by removing the wand, this vac is designed specifically to be a portable vacuum. If you need something to clean your home, look literally anywhere else in this list.\nHowever, if you want something for small and awkward cleaning tasks, like the footwells of your car, your stairs, or the crevices of your furniture, the UltraCyclone is for you. There's only one power setting, but it delivers good suction, and the battery life is decent for a vacuum of this type. There's a range of useful tools for different tasks \u2013 in our review, we were especially impressed by the motorized pet hair tool and the crevice tool. It's also nice and affordable, and great value for what you're getting.\nOn the downside, the main body of the vacuum is a little on the bulky side, so it can be difficult to get it into particularly tight corners. Our guide to the best car vacuum has plenty of alternatives, if you want more options.\nRead our full Shark Ultracyclone Pet Plus Pro review\nSpecs comparison\nModel | Bagless | Weight | Bin size | Max runtime |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n1.

Meet some of the expert reviewers who tested the cordless vacuums that feature in this guide.\nSharmishta is TechRadar's APAC Managing Editor. She has spent the past seven years testing vacuum cleaners of all shapes and sizes \u2013 Dyson, Shark, Ecovacs and other brands in-between. She's fascinated by how far robot vacuums have come in the last few years, but also appreciates a lightweight cordless vacuum that can get into the tight spaces of her flat.\nHelen is a freelance writer who specializes in kitchen and home appliances, and has been testing vacuums since 2008. She has reviewed well over 100 different models, from the likes of Shark, Dyson and more, and is always on the lookout for a lightweight, maneuverable vacuum that's powerful and comes with the perfect selection of tools.\nThe best cordless vacuum: alternatives to consider\nShark Wandvac System\nThis is essentially a handheld vacuum with a wand and floorhead that can be attached for slightly larger cleaning tasks. In our Shark Wandvac System review, we recommended it as a lightweight option. Beware, though: the bin and battery life are handheld-sized, so don't expect to clean your whole home with it.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet\nThis premium vacuum can mop as well as vacuuming, and comes self-cleaning functionality. In our Samsung Bespoke Jet vacuum cleaner review, we were also impressed with the suction power \u2013 it handled hair and spillages of all kinds with no issues. It's an investment, but deals are fairly common now, a few years after launch.\nProscenic P12\nThis is a more affordable vacuum that offers an impressive featureset for its wallet-friendly price \u2013 there's five-stage HEPA filtration, four suction levels, floorhead headlamps, and as an LED display. In our Proscenic P12 review we found pickup good, although perhaps a little underpowered for homes with lots of carpet.\nFAQs\nWhat is the best cordless vacuum?\nRight now, we think the best cordless vacuum is the Shark Detect Pro Cordless (#1). It offers a balance of suction performance, usability and tech smarts that will suit a wide range of customers and home types, and comes in at an affordable price, too. A close runner-up is the Dreame R20 (#2), which comes with a second cleaner head specifically for hard floors. However, if you have more specific needs, we have also included plenty of alternative options in our guide. So if you need to tackle pet hair, you'll want the extra power of the Shark Stratos (#3), for example.\nWhat are the best cordless vacuum brands?\nWe think the two best cordless vacuum brands right now are Dyson and Shark. Both consistently test very well, but which one will suit you best will depend on your priorities.\nDyson tends to have the edge when it comes to cutting-edge tech and meticulous engineering. It has a more limited range of vacuums, but they have been carefully honed to offer the very best suction, battery life, maneuverability and cleaning efficiency. However, as a general rule they're pricier than Shark models, perhaps less good value for money, and less robust.\nShark is a newer name in the vacuum world, and its offerings are often less tech-focused. However, there are still clever practical innovations \u2013 a great example is that many of its stick vacuums are able to bend forward, allowing you to easily clean beneath furniture. Shark's vacuums tend to be cheaper and perhaps better value than Dyson's. It also has a wider, more confusing range, with models appearing and disappearing regularly.\nRead our Shark vs Dyson article for a more in-depth look at the two leading cordless vacuum brands.\nHow much suction should my cordless vacuum have?\nThis is a tricky one. It's rare that a vacuum brand will publish any suction specs, and even if it does, there are multiple different units by which suction power can be measured, making it difficult to figure out how much suction a vacuum has, let alone compare between different models.\nIt's far simpler in the robot vacuum world: there, brands use Pascals (Pa) as standard, and specs range from around 3,000 for a budget model, right up to over 10,000Pa for a premium model (there's a new wave of robot vacuums that go right up to 22,000Pa, which is extremely high).\nAs a rule of thumb, you can expect robot vacuums to have less outright suction, corded upright vacuums to have the most, and cordless stick vacuums to sit somewhere in the middle. Vacuum brand Eufy suggests that 'carpet vacuums' typically offer between 7,000 and 15,000Pa of suction, and that you should look on the upper end of that range if you want a deep clean.\nAre stick vacuums worth it?\nIn many cases, yes. The main benefit of a cordless stick vacuum is that you have the freedom to clean anywhere, without having to wrangle a cord, or being tethered to a power outlet. They also tend to be lighter and easier to maneuver than corded alternatives, and today's best models are available at a wide range of price points to suit different budgets. However, you will have to remember to charge the battery, the dust cup might be on the smaller side, and in general you should expect suction to be a little less than on a corded model.\nHow long should a cordless stick vacuum last?\nRoughly, you should expect a cordless stick vacuum to last between 3 and 5 years. However, this figure will vary by vacuum, and also be affected by how often you use it and how well you care for it. For more information, head to our guide to how long your vacuum should last. Also check out our tips for making your vacuum last longer, to maximize your investment.\nWhich cordless vacuum has the longest battery life?\nA typical cordless cleaner can run for between 40 to 60 minutes on a fully charged battery. Of the best cordless vacuums in this guide, the Dreame R20 actually offers the longest runtime, with up to an hour and a half on one charge. That's followed by the Numatic Henry Quick at #7 and Dyson Gen5detect at #10 jointly with maximum runtimes of 70 minutes. But that's based on using them in their lowest power mode, which won't be the same for all models. Plus, you'll typically find that if you run your cordless at max power you'll get far shorter runtimes.\nHow to choose the best cordless vacuum for you\nWith such a wide array of option on the market, figuring out the best cordless vacuum for your needs can feel like an overwhelming task. To help simplify things, it's worth focusing on a few key specifications.\nBattery life\nStart by checking how long the battery will last on one charge. Most of the best cordless vacuums now offer up to an hour's cleaning on one charge, while the most advanced models go right up to 70 minutes. Do bear in mind that'll be for the lowest power mode, though. It's also worth looking at whether the battery is swappable, so if you run out of power mid-clean you don\u2019t have to wait for it the battery to recharge before you can carry on.\nDust canister size\nThe size of the dust canister will also affect how many interruptions there are to your cleaning session. Roughly 0.8L is about standard and will work for most people. Less than that and expect to be emptying it fairly regularly. If you have a bigger house or lots of dust and dirt, look for 'outsized' models with larger dust cups, or consider a bagged model (these tend to have larger dust capacity).\nTools\nMost of the cordless vacuums in our list come with at least a few swappable tools to help with specific tasks. If you have hard floors, look for a model that comes with a dedicated cleaner head \u2013 this has a softer brush roll to ensure the flooring isn\u2019t damaged when vacuuming. Dyson vacuums have a compatible soft roller (read more about the Dyson vacuum tools).\nAlso, check the vacuum cleaner will be able to reach under furniture and in any tight spaces you have in your home to ensure you\u2019re thoroughly cleaning your floors every time you push a vacuum around. And if you want to get into hard-to-reach areas, a crevice tool is an absolute must.\nIf you have furry friends, look for a model that has factored this into its design \u2013 some of the models here, such as the Shark Stratos Cordless (#3) and the Halo Capsule X Pet Max (#8) can clean without getting clogged by furballs; the Shark will even neutralize unwanted smells.\nBudget\nThere's no right or wrong make or model to choose here, but it is important to get the best cordless vacuum for your particular circumstances: a do-it-all Dyson may be state of the art, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best buy for you right now. If you live in a small flat, something like the reasonably-priced Shark Stratos Cordless should cover nearly all your needs.\nIf you\u2019re still unsure, read our advice on which type of vacuum should you buy and read our comparison of canister vs upright vacuums and bagged vs bagless vacuums.\nHow we tested these cordless vacuums\n\u2705 Over 185 vacuums and robot vacuums tested in total\n\u2705 ... including 41 new vacuums reviewed in 2024\n\u2705 9 years of vacuum testing experience\nNot all cordless vacuums were created equal, but figuring out which is the best model for your needs can be tricky. To help you make the right choice for you, we test dozens of different models each year. Each cordless vacuum featured here has been put through its paces either by a TechRadar Homes team member or by one of our regular, experienced reviewers.\nOur reviews are underpinned by a set of specific, standardized tests. Here's a rundown of our review process.\nSuction tests\nOur suction tests assess how well the vacuum can pick up different kinds of debris on different types of flooring. For fine debris, we use a teabag's worth of dry tea, and for larger debris we use oats. We sprinkle 20g of each mixture (separately) on hard floor and on carpet / a rug, and see how many passes are required to clear the spillage. We start on the vacuum's lowest suction setting, and increase if there is debris remaining.\nThe final suction test is to see how well the cordless vacuum can pick up hair from both carpet and hard flooring \u2013 both the main floorhead and any hair-specific attachments. We also check to see if the hair becomes tangled in the brushroll, and if so, how easy it is to remove.\nBattery tests\nBattery life is a major element of cordless vacuums. We time how long the vacuum lasts on a single charge, on each available suction setting. We also record how long it takes to completely recharge, from a flat battery.\nGeneral tests\nAlongside specific suction and battery tests, we also assess how usable the vacuum is in general. The reviewer will use the vacuum regularly for at least a couple of weeks, testing out any provided attachments and special features. We'll also consider things like how easy the vacuum is to maneuver, how functional the design is in terms of swapping attachments, emptying the bin and so on, and how comfortable it is to use in general.\nRead more on how we test cordless vacuum cleaners.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "\"The slower you go, the more you will pick up\" \u2013 Dyson engineer reveals the most efficient vacuum cleaning technique, backed up by science\nTop tips for the best vacuuming performance\nEver wondered if your vacuum cleaning technique is up to scratch? I spoke to a Dyson engineer \u2013 whose job includes investigating exactly how efficient each method of vacuuming is \u2013 to find out the ideal speed, setting and approach that will deliver the best results. Arming yourself with the best vacuum for the job is only half the battle.\nHere's what Senior Floorcare Engineer Jonny Gray had to say.\nHow fast should you be vacuuming?\n\"For both carpet and hard floor, the slower you go, the more you will pick up,\" says Johnny. Exactly how slow will depend on the vacuum you have and the setting you're using, but Dyson studies found that when using the Dyson V15 \u2013 one of the best Dyson vacuums in the lineup \u2013 in Boost mode, 100% of dust was sucked up from the test carpet while moving at a speed of 0.25 meters per second.\nFor reference, the speed used in industry standard tests is 0.5m/s. That's representative of how fast most people vacuum. So you'd be going half as fast, and in the highest suction mode.\n\"On carpet, for every 0.25m/s you speed up, you will lose about an extra 3-5% dust pickup,\" adds Johnny. \"The difference in performance across speeds is more significant in lower power modes, so the lower the power mode the slower you should move.\"\nWhat about in 'Auto' mode?\nA few of today's best cordless vacuums have an 'Auto' mode, where the suction will automatically ramp up or down depending on how much dust is on the floor. If your vacuum has one of these, it's the mode you'll likely be using the majority of the time \u2013 not least because max / boost modes are notoriously quick to run down the battery.\nJohnny says that slowing down can be especially efficient when using Dyson's auto mode. \"The most dramatic improvement for going slow is when pulling dust out of deep crevices in Auto mode. By slowing down from 0.5m/s to 0.25m/s, we see an 80% uplift in performance, picking up close to 100% of the dust below the cleaner head despite not being in the highest power setting.\"\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDoes that vary by particle size?\nIn Dyson's studies, a fine dust mixture with particles ranging from 90\u00b5m-200\u00b5m was used. \"In principle, the most difficult particle size to collect is fine dust from a carpet, as this smaller particle falls deeper into the carpet which makes it more difficult to entrain,\" explains Johnny. \"Moving slower will not only disturb the dust less (which may cause it to drop deeper into the carpet) but also provide a larger window of opportunity to entrain the particles.\"\nWhy is vacuuming slowly more effective?\nThe reason why slowing down makes for a more efficient clean is to do with the 'dwell time' (how long the cleaner head is positioned over a certain area of floor) and, when on carpet, the agitation of the fibers. \"Increasing the dwell time provides more opportunity to remove the dust through mechanical agitation and airflow entrainment,\" says Johnny. \"Agitating the carpet without airflow would cause it to fall deeper into the carpet, and so moving fast might cause more agitation with less opportunity to entrain the dust in the airflow.\"\nCould you achieve the same result by going over the same spot a number of times?\nAlthough completing more passes on the same area will increase the amount of dust that gets picked up, you might be better off going slowly instead. Dyson's tests found that pickup was slightly better (around 2%) when performing a single pass at half speed, rather than two passes at full speed. \"For the same time spent vacuuming, you\u2019re better off going at a slower speed and doing fewer passes over the same area,\" concludes Johnny.\nHow did you figure all this out?\nThe Dyson engineers completed a study using the test method standards laid out by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) \u2013 an international organization that publishes international standards for electrical devices. \"We have automated test rigs which use a robot arm to push and pull the vacuum across a surface and so we were able to programme the robot arm to a variety of speeds and test the vacuum on a range of surfaces across all power modes,\" Johnny explains.\nYou might also like...\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "Dyson engineer reveals the often-overlooked feature that vacuum cleaners are 'pointless' without \u2013 and it's nothing to do with suction\nStrong suction is only part of the equation\nAll kinds of factors come into play when trying to figure out the best vacuum cleaner to buy, but most people probably assume that strong suction is the most important thing to focus on. Good suction isn't irrelevant \u2013 you need a certain amount of air watts of power to pull up dust and debris from floors. However, it's not the be-all and end-all, as I learned when I spoke to Dyson engineer Amy Wright.\n\"Many people assume that if visible dust and dirt is picked up, the problem is solved, but vacuum cleaning is pointless without thorough filtration,\" says Amy. If your vacuum has inadequate filters or loose seals, it'll end up releasing some of the dust and dirt it has picked up back into the air.\n\"A good vacuum cleaner is fully sealed and equipped with an advanced, multi-stage filtration system to ensure that all the dust that is picked up remains trapped inside the vacuum and only clean air is expelled back into the house,\" she continues.\nThe best Dyson vacuums in the lineup combine HEPA filtration with a fully sealed system. A HEPA filter captures 99.97 percent of particles as small as 0.1 microns. However, it'll only capture the particles from the air that passes through it, which is where the sealed system comes into play.\nAmy also stresses the importance of a good dust separation system. \"The difficulty in engineering a good vacuum cleaner lies in ensuring that there is no drop in performance throughout the cleaning process,\" she explains. \"An efficient dust separation system ensures that filters do not get clogged so there is no loss of suction that will affect the performance of the vacuum cleaner.\"\nBrilliant brushes\nAlongside a good filtering system, the design of the floorheads make a big difference to how effectively a vacuum can clean with the suction power available.\n\"Dust and both pet and human hair embed into carpeted surfaces and electrostatically \u2018stick\u2019 to hard floors,\" says Amy. \"Agitation is required to peel back carpet pile to remove dust and hair in carpets, while carbon fiber removes the static attraction between fine dust and hard floors.\"\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDyson's Motorbar head has stiff, nylon bristles to agitate carpet fibers and tackle dust, hair and trodden-in dirt embedded there. It can also be used on hard floors, but if you have a lot of delicate hard flooring it's worth seeking out an option with an entirely soft secondary floorhead (this is a feature we look for when seeking out the best vacuum cleaners for hardwood floor).\n\"When vacuuming hard floors, we recommend selecting a cleaner head that is soft enough to protect floor finish, while also being effective at pick-up,\" explains Amy. \"Dyson\u2019s Fluffy Optic cleaner head features anti-static nylon bristles to remove electrostatic attractions between fine dust and hard floors for effective pick-up.\"\nTop tools\nAnything else to look out for? Amy stresses the importance of good detail tools. These help turn your vacuum into a well-rounded cleaning tool for all kinds of surfaces. Most vacuums will come with at least a crevice tool and some kind of multi-tool, but today's best cordless vacuums go a step further and include more specific options.\nThe most unique offering in the Dyson attachment range is probably the Hair screw tool \u2013 a small, motorized cleaner head for furniture, with a tapering brushroll designed specifically for handling hair.\n\"Dyson\u2019s Hair Screw Tool spirals hair off and into the bin making it ideal for removing hair from pet beds, car seats and stairs,\" explains Amy. \"Dyson engineers delicately tweaked the precise angle of the bristles on the tool, to ensure the release force did not tangle the hair, and tested the tool on multiple hair types.\"\nYou might also like...\n- \"The slower you go, the more you will pick up\" \u2013 Dyson engineer reveals the most efficient vacuum cleaning technique, backed up by science\n- I asked the experts what pet owners should look for in a vacuum cleaner \u2013 here are their top 10 tips\n- DJI\u2019s first robot vacuum gets launch date in official teaser \u2013 and it looks like the Romo is arriving sooner than expected\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "When it comes to choosing the best vacuum cleaner, one of the biggest decisions you'll face is whether to opt for a corded or cordless model. But frustratingly, there's no one-size-fits-all solution.\nBoth types of vacuum cleaner have their pros and cons. So it's largely a matter of weighing up the key factors and deciding which is most important to you. Things to consider will include your home's size, floor types, cleaning habits and how much you have to spend.\nThe good news is that whichever type you choose, today's vacuum cleaners offer impressive performance to keep your home clean and healthy. In this article, we'll look at each of the main differences between the best cordless vacuums and the best corded vacuums, and help you make an informed choice.\n1. Cleaning power and suction\nTraditionally, corded vacuums have had the edge when it comes to raw cleaning power. Using mains electricity allows them to utilize more powerful motors, resulting in stronger suction. This makes them particularly effective for deep-cleaning carpets and tackling stubborn dirt and debris.\nFor example, the Shark Stratos Upright Vacuum (AZ913UKT) demonstrates the impressive power of corded models today. Its DuoClean floorhead, featuring two motorized brushrolls, provides excellent performance across various floor types. The vacuum's powerful suction makes it particularly effective for homes with mostly carpeted floors or those dealing with deep-set dirt.\nHaving said that, cordless technology has advanced significantly in recent years. Many modern cordless vacuums now offer impressive suction power that can rival their corded counterparts. For example, our reviewer found the Dyson Gen5detect boasts impressive suction power, with an auto mode that adjusts based on floor type and dirt levels. On the whole, though, if you have a home with mostly carpets or frequently deal with deep-set dirt, a corded vacuum will still probably be the better choice for consistent, powerful cleaning.\nHowever, do consider if you need all that suction. If your home has mostly hard floors, and/or doesn't deal with lots of foot traffic, then a cordless model might offer plenty of power for your needs. The Shark Detect Pro Cordless doesn't have the most outright power, but it's still an excellent choice for most homes.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n2. Battery life and runtime\nThe most obvious limitation of cordless vacuums is that you can only use them until their battery runs out, and you have to remember to charge them after you've finished cleaning.\nMost cordless models offer anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes of cleaning time on a single charge, depending on the power setting you switch them to. For instance, the Dyson V11 provides up to 60 minutes of runtime in Eco Mode, with a helpful LCD display that shows exactly how much cleaning time is left. Bump up to the Gen5detect, and that increases to 70 minutes, although here is a payoff in terms of weight \u2013 that model is heavy for a cordless stick vacuum.\nIf you have a larger home or prefer to do all your cleaning in one go, though, you might find the limited runtime of cordless vacuums frustrating. Corded vacuums, in contrast, can run indefinitely as long as they're plugged in, allowing for uninterrupted cleaning sessions. That makes this type of cleaner ideal for thorough, whole-house cleaning, without the worry of battery life.\n3. Convenience and maneuverability\nWhile corded vacuums never run out of power, they are limited by the length of the power cable, and those cables can trip you up if you're not careful. In contrast, a cordless vacuum offers unparalleled freedom of movement. You can easily move it from room to room, up and down the stairs, or even outside to clean your car, without worrying about finding a nearby power outlet.\nCordless vacuums are also typically lighter and more compact than their corded counterparts. The Shark WandVac System, for example, is a particularly lightweight option that can easily convert between a handheld and floor vacuum for versatile cleaning. On the flipside, corded vacuums often have larger dust capacities, meaning you won't need to empty them as frequently.\n4. Versatility\nBoth corded and cordless vacuums can come with a variety of attachments for different cleaning tasks. However, cordless models, especially stick vacuums, often have an edge in terms of versatility. Typically, many convert into handheld units for cleaning furniture, car interiors, or other hard-to-reach areas, so you won't need to invest in a separate handheld vacuum.\n5. Cost\nCordless vacuums tend to be more expensive than comparable corded models due to the cost of battery technology. For example, the Dyson Gen5detect is a high-end cordless with a premium price tag of $949.99 / \u00a3769.99 / AU$1,549. In contrast, the latest Dyson corded upright, the Dyson Ball Animal 3, has a list price of $499.99 / \u00a3279.99 / AU$599.\nIt's worth noting, too, that cordless vacuums may have additional long-term costs, such as replacing batteries over time. That said, there are more budget-friendly cordless options available. The Roidmi S2 offers good performance at a more accessible price point at $359 / \u00a3419.\n6. Lifespan and environmental impact\nCordless vacuums rely on batteries, which have environmental implications both in their production and disposal. Some models, like the Halo Capsule X Pet Max, use compostable dust bags, which can help mitigate environmental concerns. Corded vacuums avoid these issues but may consume more energy over their lifetime due to their more powerful motors.\nHowever, when it comes to predicted lifespan, there's a clear winner: corded vacuums typically last significantly longer than cordless ones. While the specific model and how you're using it will make a big difference, cordless vacs are typically expected to last three to five years, while if you go corded, it's more like eight to 10.\nCorded vs cordless vacuum: which should I buy?\nUltimately, the choice between corded and cordless comes down to your specific needs. On balance, you'll usually wish to choose a corded vacuum if:\n- You have a larger home\n- You prefer uninterrupted, powerful cleaning sessions\n- You have mostly carpeted floors\n- You're on a tighter budget\n- You want something that'll last a long time\nMeanwhile, you'll probably prefer a cordless vacuum if:\n- You value convenience and easy maneuverability\n- You have a smaller home or frequently clean small areas\n- You want a versatile cleaner for various surfaces and spaces\n- You're willing to pay more for the latest tech\nTom May is a freelance writer and editor specialising in tech, design and sleep products.

      "text": "We've been testing the best vacuum cleaners for almost a decade \u2013 here are our top picks\nAfter reviewing nearly 200 vacuums, these are the models that came out on top\nAt TechRadar, we've been testing the best vacuum cleaners for nine years. During that time, we've reviewed nearly 200 different models. As the Homes Editor for floorcare appliances, a big part of my job is focused on vacuum cleaners of all kinds. I know what makes a great dust-buster, what specs and design features to look for, what type of cleaner will suit what customer, and which brands that can be relied upon to deliver.\nBased on all that expertise, and many, many hours of testing, I've come to the conclusion that the Dreame R20 is the best vacuum cleaner for the majority of people. On test, it delivered impressive suction, paired with a nimble, lightweight build and useful automation features. It's also excellent value for money. That said, it won't be ideal for everyone, so my ranking includes alternative options for a range of needs and budgets.\nFor example, if you have a lot of carpet and need something for heavy-duty cleaning, you might be better off with an upright, corded model. Those with mainly hard floors and not a lot of foot traffic can get away with more lightweight, lower-powered vacuums. I'll talk you through the pros and cons of each model listed here, so you can choose with confidence. This article includes all different types of vacuums. We have a separate guide dedicated to the best cordless vacuums, if you know that's what you want. All clear?

She's spent the past year focusing on home appliances, and vacuum cleaners in particular.\nThe best vacuum cleaner for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a lightweight vacuum: Mainly thanks to its carbon-fiber wand, this is one the lightest stick vacs you can buy.\n\u2705 You need versatility: This vacuum comes with lots of detail tools and two floorheads, so can tackle a range of cleaning tasks.\n\u274c You'd like an auto-empty base: The PowerDetect at #6 has a compatible auto-empty base; that's not an option here.\n\u274c You want a very robust vacuum: This is a nimble vacuum; for something sturdier check out the Shark Stratos, either in upright (#3) or cordless (#5) form.\nIt's not yet such a well known name as Dyson or Shark, but our reviewer was blown away when they tested this Dreame R20 vacuum. In fact, we think it'll be the best vacuum cleaner for most people. This lightweight cordless vacuum delivers exceptional cleaning at a very competitive price \u2013 it's generally discounted to the bottom of the mid-range bracket, and punches well above its price tag.\nThe suction performance is superb, on carpet as well as hard floor, and there's also automatic dust detection \u2013 meaning it'll ramp up power when it senses the floor is especially dirty. The only thing missing is a low-powered mode for when you want to preserve battery, although the battery life is long enough that this might not matter.\nThe R20 is one of the lightest stick vacuums on the market, thanks mainly to its carbon fibre wand. On test, we found it easy to maneuver \u2013 plus, there's an attachment that enables the wand to bend forwards to a right angle for easy cleaning under furniture. The design in general is very user-friendly, save for an over-sensitive power trigger and a slightly awkwardly placed finger guard (in general, we'd prefer an on-off switch instead \u2013 although Dreame does at least include a separate button for continual running).\nThere's also a multitude of attachments, including two floorheads (one geared towards hard floor and the other for carpet) and a smaller motorized cleaner head for upholstery. All that makes it nice and versatile, for tackling a range of cleaning tasks.\nAlternatives\nAnother excellent all-rounder is the Shark Detect Pro cordless. It originally held the top spot in this list, but it's increasingly hard to get hold of, and a lack of deals means the R20 is generally much better value these days.\nRead more: Dreame R20 cordless vacuum review\nThe best premium vacuum cleaner\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a top quality vacuum: Dyson vacuums are a cut above the competition in terms of quality and innovation.\n\u2705 You love a hi-tech gadget: There are features here you won't find anywhere else \u2013 including real time dirt reports as you clean.\n\u274c You like to keep things simple: If you're not interested in the bells and whistles, something like the Halo at #4 is a simple vacuum with superb cleaning powers.\n\u274c You're on a budget: There are plenty of much cheaper options that'll be perfectly good enough for most people's needs \u2013 including the R20 at #1.\nIf you have cash to splash and want a top-quality, meticulously engineered machine, the best vacuum for you is the Dyson V15 Detect. The suction is serious powerful, the design is efficient and user-friendly, and it feels top quality too. On top of that, you're getting advanced features you won't find elsewhere.\nThere are sensors in the floorhead that adjust suction levels depending on the kind of floor its on (hard floor or carpet) and how dirty it is, for a low-effort, battery-efficient clean. Some other vacuums here also offer similar automation (namely the Dreame R20 at #1 and Shark PowerDetect at #6) but here it's accompanied by real-time reports, delivered colorfully on a small screen, of exactly what the vacuum it sucking up as it does so.\nAlongside the main floorhead is a second, soft head designed specifically for use on hard floors. The clever addition here is a precisely-angled laser light, which creates big shadows on the tiniest flecks of dust, so you can be sure you haven't missed anything. It works far more effectively than the LED headlamps found on competitor machines, which are really just to brighten the way. You're also getting a range of thoughtfully designed detail tools, including a mini motorized floorhead that has a conical roller to direct hair long straight into the bin rather that letting it get tangled up. It's excellent for cleaning furniture.\nOur only real complaint with the design is that it's trigger-operated, with no option to lock in for continual running. That means if you're cleaning a large area, your finger is going to get tired.\nOverall, the V15 is an outstanding machine, but all this innovation comes at a serious price. For many people, a cheaper model will do an almost-as-good cleaning job, but if you decide to invest, you shouldn't be disappointed.\nAlternatives\nIf you're a fan of the brand, our guide to the best Dyson vacuums runs down your options in the lineup, so you can pick the one that suits your needs. If you want the latest and greatest (based on specs), it's the Dyson Gen5detect. The motor has been redesigned to be more powerful and efficient, and there are further design tweaks \u2013 including button rather than trigger operation \u2013 but otherwise it's very similar to the same as the V15. For more on how the two match up, head to our V15 Detect vs Gen5detect comparison.\nRead our full Dyson V15 Detect review\nThe best upright vacuum cleaner\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want maximum power: Corded uprights tend to deliver the most suction, and because it's corded, you'll never run out of juice.\n\u2705 You want your vacuum to last: Corded uprights have a longer lifespan than cordless vacuums.\n\u274c You don't want a corded vacuum: Although the cord is fairly long, you're still going to be tethered to a wall.\n\u274c You have a small home: This vac is relatively large and bulky; a cordless stick is a better choice for small homes.\nIf you want outright power, a corded upright is typically the best option, and our top pick in this category is the Shark Stratos Upright. If you need something for deep cleans, it's an excellent choice, and on test we found it was great for tackling pet hair, too. The cord means there's no time limit on your cleaning session, and while it can be annoying to have to navigate a cord, the fact that it's 8m long means you shouldn't feel too tethered to the wall. A large dust cup means you won't be traipsing back and forth from the trash can, and our tester was a big fan of the anti-odor puck, which keeps things smelling fresh.\nWhile it's clearly bulkier and heavier than the cordless vacuums in this list (including the stick option from the same range, at #5), it has been designed for maximum flexibility within that upright form factor. So the dust cup / motor part can be lifted off and held in your hand, and the cleaner head added to the end of a stretch hose \u2013 super useful for tackling things like stairs. If you're not sure it's right for you, our guide to the best upright vacuums has plenty of alternative options.\nIt's worth noting before you buy that Shark makes a few Stratos Upright vacuums with very similar names and designs \u2013 this exact model isn't available in the US, but there are various options with mostly the same features.\nRead our full Shark Stratos Pet Pro Upright Vacuum review\nThe best vacuum cleaner for carpet\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have a lot of carpet: This model aced all our suction tests, including lifting ingrained dirt from carpet.\n\u2705 You want something simple but powerful: While it lacks fancy features, we can't fault this vacuum's cleaning power.\n\u274c You want a bagless vacuum: While the bags here are generous, you'll still need to remember to replace them when full.\n\u274c You want automatic suction adjustment: This vacuum can't detect dirt or floor type, so you'll need to be prepared to adjust suction manually.\nThe Halo Capsule X is a slightly quirkily designed vacuum, but when it comes to suction it's seriously impressive. It aced all of our suction tests, and is our pick for the best vacuum for carpet, but it's equally impressive on hard floors. It looks a little weird, but it's comfortable to hold, feels light in the hand and is easy to maneuver too (although a little tricky for getting right under furniture).\nUnusually in this list, the Capsule X is a bagged vacuum. That will be a negative for some, but it does have its benefits, including the ability to suck up fine particles like fireplace ash without ruining the motor. The bags are made from compostable cardboard and brown paper, to minimize environmental impact, but they do represent an ongoing cost.\nThe battery life is fine but not the longest here, and the fact it comes with two batteries bundled in means you can extend runtimes by hot-swapping them. Neither does the Halo Capsule X offer much in the way of special features \u2013 there's no automatic suction adjustment based on dirt levels or floor type, as offered by vacuums like the Dreame R20 (#1), and there are no headlamps on the floorhead, either.\nSo if you're seeking smart features, look elsewhere in this list, but for pure suction power in a cordless form factor, the Halo Capsule X is an excellent choice.\nRead our full Halo Capsule X Pet Max review\nThe best vacuum for pet hair\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have pets: Powerful suction, a detangling floorhead and an odor-neutralizing puck make this perfect for pet owners.\n\u2705 You want plenty of cleaning time: Up to a full hour's cleaning on one charge is up there with the longest cordless runtimes here.\n\u274c You want something lightweight: There are lighter and more maneuverable cordless vacuums here.\n\u274c You really need something heavy duty: As a rule, a corded upright will always deliver the most powerful suction, if you can deal with the relative inconvenience.\nThe Shark Stratos Cordless is the best vacuum if need to tackle pet hair. It packs an impressive amount of power for a cordless model and boasts a few features that make it especially well suited to households with hairy pets (or indeed, hairy humans). The main floorhead \u2013 which is suitable for hard floors as well as carpet \u2013 is designed in such a way that it'll siphon hair off the brushroll as you clean, and direct it straight into the dust cup. This stops things getting clogged, while the built-in odor neutralizer keeps it all smelling fresh.\nThere's up to a full hour's cleaning on one charge, and the dust cup is generous for a cordless too, which means you can clean for longer without having to empty it. A wand that can bend forwards to 90-degrees means getting right under furniture is a cinch, and on test we were also impressed with this vacuum\u2019s ability to remove hair from furniture when used in handheld and Boost mode. All those factors mean it sits at the top of our best vacuum for pet hair guide.\nAlternatives\nIf you don't have such demanding cleaning needs, you could opt for a less robust option like the the Dreame R20 (#1). Alternatively, if you need maximum power and are happy to sacrifice maneuverability to get it, you can beat a corded upright like #3. If you have a bigger budget and want the extra convenience, you should also check out the PowerDetect at #6, which has a compatible auto-empty dock that takes the hassle out of dealing with pet hair-packed dust cups.\nRead our full Shark Stratos Cordless review\nThe best auto-empty vacuum cleaner\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have pets: The dock comes into its own for homes with lots of dust or pet hair.\n\u2705 You suffer from allergies: The auto-empty system means far fewer chances for allergens to escape back into the air.\n\u274c You have a small home: The dock is bulky and won't be worth it if you're only vacuuming a smaller space.\n\u274c You have lots of nooks and crannies: This is a heavier option \u2013 if you want a nimble vacuum, check out the Dreame at #1.\nThe Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty is the only vacuum in this ranking to have a compatible auto-empty base. Dock the vacuum and all the dust will whoosh out of the small onboard dust cup and into a far larger dust cup in the base, via a closed system. The dock will also charge the vacuum. It takes all the effort and mess out of emptying, meaning it's a once-every-couple-of-months job rather than something you have to do each time you clean.\nThe system comes into its own in larger homes with lots of dirt or pet hair. It might also be helpful for those who suffer from allergies, because there will be far fewer chances for allergens to escape back into the air during emptying. It is a fairly bulky dock, so perhaps best suited to those who have a separate utility room where this can be tucked away. Shark has added an odor-neutralizing puck to the dock to stop it smelling musty.\nOn the vacuum itself, you're getting Shark's most advanced detection features. The PowerDetect knows if what kind of floor it's on and how dirty that floor is, and will adjust suction and brushroll speed accordingly. It can also sense when it's near the edge of a room, and will increase suction on the relevant side of the floorhead only, to clear dust that may have collected there. Shark has also redesigned the floorhead so it won't cause debris to pool behind it when the vacuum is pulled backwards \u2013 this was an issue on previous models.\nWhile the PowerDetect Cordless is heavier and longer than other cordless models in this ranking, on test we found it packed a very impressive amount of suction power. Our reviewer was also a big fan of the fact the wand can bend forwards to 90 degrees to enable easier cleaning under furniture.\nAlternatives to consider\nAuto-empty vacuums are still quite rare, but there are a few alternatives to consider. The Shark Detect Pro also has an optional auto-empty dock. This vacuum is smaller, lighter and less powerful than the PowerDetect, and a little tricky to get hold of these days. If you have a bigger budget, there's also the Samsung Bespoke Jet range \u2013 the newest model being the Samsung Bespoke AI Jet Ultra cordless vacuum. The dock is much slicker looking and the vacuum is high-end, but it's generally a fair bit pricier than the PowerDetect.\nRead our full Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty review\nThe best robot vacuum cleaner\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're struggling to stay on top of cleaning: Schedule this bot to clean regularly, while you're out, so the dirt never builds up.\n\u2705 You have hard floors as well as carpet: This bot mops as well as vacuuming, so it'll take care of all your cleaning needs.\n\u274c You want maximum suction: It's not nearly as sucky as a manual vacuum, so you'll need to hang on to one of those for deep cleans.\n\u274c You have a home with lots of levels: Robot vacuums can't get up and down stairs.\nIf you're after effort-free cleaning, perhaps it's time to consider a robovac. Our top-rated option is the Roborock Qrevo Curv. (It's quite different from the other entries in this ranking, so if you know this is the type you want, head to our separate, dedicated guide to the best robot vacuums to see your other options.)\nRobot vacuums are perfect for regular, hands-off, light cleaning \u2013 the idea being that you run them regularly, while you're out, so the dust never builds up. While it's not quite as powerful as a manual vacuum, the Qrevo Curv offers extremely strong suction for a robovac. It sailed through our suction tests, but \u2013 perhaps more impressively \u2013 it also had no trouble pulling large volumes of hair from carpeted floors in our tester's pet-filled home. It'll automatically empty all dust and debris into a large dust bag in the base station whenever it docks, too.\nLike many robovacs, the Curv has mopping capabilities, which means it can keep your hard floors looking spick and span, too. It's smart enough to be able to sense carpet, and will either lift its mop pads in response or leave them in the dock when not needed, so you don't need to worry about damp carpets. The advanced dock will take care of annoying mop maintenance tasks like refilling the onboard water tanks, dispensing detergent, and cleaning and drying the mop pads. However, said station is a little bulky so do make sure you have somewhere for it to live.\nWhile a robot vacuum can transform your cleaning routine, be aware that you probably will need to keep a dedicated manual vacuum on hand for things like stairs and furniture.\nRead our full Roborock Qrevo Curv review\nThe best vacuum cleaner for hard floors\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have mostly hard floors: This vacuum delivers great suction on hard floors .\n\u2705 You have pets: The mini pet brush is great at pulling hair from upholstery.\n\u274c You have a lot of carpet: On test, this vacuum didn't perform that well on carpet.\n\u274c You live in the US: This model is UK-only.\nIf you're constantly vacuuming around after hairy pets, then the Samsung Jet 85 Pet could be your savior (provided you don't live in the US, where it's not currently available). This vacuum's mini motorized pet hair brush tool is the best our reviewer \u2013 a Labrador owner \u2013 had tested, making light work of dog hair on pet beds, car seats and more.\nThe main Jet 85 Pet vacuum cleaner head also delivers great suction on hard floors, and fine (although not amazing) dirt pickup on carpet. It'll deliver up to 44 minutes of vacuuming, depending which of the four power modes you use. (It's considerably less in the maximum 'Jet' mode, but this is so powerful you're unlikely to ever really need it.)\nElsewhere, this vacuum is ergonomic and comfortable to use, and overall a competent performer. For pet owners, and especially those with mostly hard floors in their home, it's as very strong recommendation.\nRead more: Samsung Jet 85 Pet vacuum cleaner review\nThe best vacuum and mop combo\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a complete cleaner for hard floors: This 2-in-1 vacuums as well as mopping, so it'll take care of all your hard floor cleaning needs.\n\u2705 Your floors get very dirty: The S7 is perfect for bigger messes, and disinfects and deodorizes as well as just cleaning up.\n\u274c You have mostly carpet: This cleaner isn't suitable for carpet, so it's only really worth the investment (and space) if you have mostly hard floors.\n\u274c Your floors don't get that dirty: There are simpler, cheaper mop options if you just need something for light cleans.\nIf you want a more complete cleaning solution for hard floors, we rate the Tineco Floor One S7 Pro the best wet-dry vacuum on the market. This model offers top-notch vacuuming and mopping, and deodorizes and disinfects as it goes, leaving floors spotless. It's heavy at nearly 10kg, but its self-propelling capabilities make it super-easy to push about.\nAll that cleaning power takes a toll on the battery life, which is relatively short at 40 minutes on one charge. Our tester also found the water tank a little small \u2013 the clean water tank is 0.85L, while the dirty one is 0.72L (to account for the fact that some water is staying on the floor). During our review, we found it needed to be emptied quite frequently. And as you might expect, it's not for carpeted floors.\nThere are lots of useful features, including voice prompts and a bright LED display that lets you know what mode you\u2019re using as well as water and battery levels. Being able to vacuum and mop in one go is in itself a revelation for how much time and effort it saves.\nIt's a bit of an investment, but we think the performance justifies the higher price. If you want something more affordable, the Roborock Dyad Pro is our favorite budget wet-dry option.\nRead our full Tineco Floor One S7 Pro review\nThe best car vacuum\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need something to clean your car: This handheld offers strong suction and will get your car looking spick and span in an instant.\n\u2705 You have pets: The motorized pet tool is great at tackling pet hair.\n\u274c You want to also clean your home: A small dust cup and short battery life mean this is for small cleaning tasks only.\n\u274c You have a very small car: This model is relatively large for a handheld, so it might not be able to get into every tiny nook and cranny.\nAs the name suggests, the Shark Ultracyclone Pet Pro Plus (sold as the Shark Classic Handheld Pet Vacuum in the UK) is designed with pet owners in mind, but its compact size and impressive cleaning capabilities make it an absolute winner if you're looking for the best car vacuum.\nIts motorized pet tool does an excellent job of picking up pet hair, but it's also ideal for cleaning upholstery and getting dirt and debris off carpets; there's also a crevice tool that's just the thing for getting into tight spots such as between sofa cushions, or behind foot pedals and inside door bins in your car.\nOn test, we found the Ultracyclone Pet Pro Plus offered good suction and had no issues with clearing surface-level debris, although it struggled when it came to shifting ground-in dirt on carpets. That's not a massive surprise given the small size \u2013 handhelds tend not to be able to match full-size vacuums in terms of suction. The battery life is also decent for a handheld (Shark promises 10 minutes but we found we could eke 15 minutes out of a full charge), and long enough to give your car a thorough once-over.\nWhile this is a handheld vacuum it's just a little on the large and heavy side, and you'll need to find somewhere to store it when it's not in use. However if you value having a spotless car interior (particularly if you have pets), this one's a fine choice.\nRead our full Shark Ultracyclone Pet Plus Pro review\nSpecs comparison\nModel | Type | Bagless | Weight | Bin size | Max runtime |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n1.

These models all scored highly in our tests, but just didn't quite make our main guide.\nDyson Gen5detect\nThe Gen5 is the latest and greatest Dyson. It has redesigned mechanics that deliver more powerful suction and longer runtimes than its predecessor (the V15 at #2), but it's also heavier in the hand. Expect advanced features like real-time dust reports and a laser on the Fluffy floorhead.\nRead our full Dyson Gen5detect review\nShark Detect Pro Cordless\nThe Detect Pro is a lighter and less powerful sibling to the PowerDetect (#6). It boasts advanced automation features, including the ability to detect edges and boost suction on the relevant side of the floorhead in response. It also comes with an optional auto-empty dock \u2013 in fact, it's a little tricky to find the vacuum on its own at a reasonable price now.\nRead our full Shark Detect Pro cordless review\nMiele DuoFlex HX1\nThis is a sturdy cordless vacuum with good suction, and useful automatic suction adjustment and a self-cleaning filter. It\u2019s a little heavy, the dustbin is small and battery life relatively short, making it better suited to small homes\nRead our full Miele DuoFlex HX1 review\nHenry Quick\nThis vacuum is powerful, and offers a good battery life and useful additions like floorhead headlamps and a scent-booster. It's bagged, which means no more messy filter cleaning and no more dust escaping back into the air, although you will have to remember to buy new 'pods' as needed. They have a generous 2L capacity, though. It's UK-only, and with one of its regular discounts, can be great value for money.\nRead our full Henry Quick vacuum review\nDyson V11\nThe V11 sits below the V15 Detect (#2), and lacks that model's flashier features \u2013 there's no real-time dust reports or laser equipped floorheads here. However, it still shines in terms of cleaning powers, offering powerful suction, useful detail tool and dragonfly-like maneuverability. It's also lighter in hand than the newer Dysons.\nRead our full Dyson V11 review\nSamsung Bespoke Jet AI\nSamsung's premium cordless vacuum goes hard on cutting-edge features, using AI to identify precise floor type (and adjust suction and brush speed in response) and bundling in a self-empty base. Suction is excellent, and there's a mop floorhead for tackling spillages on hard floors. It'll cost you, though.\nRead our full Samsung Bespoke Jet AI review\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat kind of vacuum should I buy?\nThere are a number of different types of vacuums on the market, to suit different needs. Here's a super-quick rundown of the main benefits and drawbacks of each type:\nPros...\nLightweight, easy to maneuver; ideal for homes with multiple floors.\nCons...\nTend to have less outright power than anything corded, and a shorter overall lifespan too.\nPros...\nUpright vacuums tend to have a lot of suction power, and last a long time overall, too.\nCons...\nBulkier, heavier and less easy to maneuver than a cordless stick vacuum.\nPros...\nHands-free, and clean while you're out for minimal disruption. Many can mop, too.\nCons...\nLess suction than a manual vac, not great at edges and corners, can't do stairs.\nPros...\nGood suction and robustly built. The flexible tube great for getting into nooks and crannies.\nCons...\nDragging the canister can be annoying \u2013 and especially if your home has a lot of stairs.\nPros...\nCompact, lightweight and perfect for small and awkward cleaning tasks, such as the inside of your car.\nCons...\nVery short battery life, relatively low powered, and not suitable for large areas.\nPros...\nPerfect for deep cleaning floors, and tackling wet spillages. Generally best for lino or tiled floors.\nCons...\nWhile some can also vacuum your carpet, they tend not to be specialized for this.\nWhat's the best vacuum right now?\nThe best vacuum for most people right now is the Shark Detect Pro cordless. This vacuum is lightweight and easy to maneuver, has enough power for most people's needs, boasts useful automation features, and shouldn't break the bank either. However, the Dreame R20 cordless stick vacuum is a very close runner-up, and also worth considering.\nIf you'd prefer a more traditional, upright model, our top pick is the Shark Stratos Upright, while those seeking a hands-off option should check out the the Eufy X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum.\nIs Shark better than Dyson?\nShark and Dyson are two of the biggest names dominating the floor care market right now, so if you\u2019re considering kitting your home out with a powerful new vacuum, it makes sense to opt for one of these brands. But which is best?\nIn a nutshell, Dyson vacuums are more expensive but this ensures you get a vacuum cleaner that\u2019s extremely powerful but still lightweight and easy to maneuver around your home. Dyson vacuums are stuffed with cutting edge technology too, from lasers that highlight hidden dust to innovative floor heads that can be moved in any direction. If you prefer a cordless model, they also come with long-lasting batteries too.\nShark\u2019s vacuum cleaners are more affordable than Dyson\u2019s offerings, but they can still match the stalwart when it comes to suction power. Shark models are not usually as sleek and stylish as Dyson\u2019s, and they\u2019re often heavier too, but they do come with useful technology such as the ability to stop hair getting tangled around the brush and flexible wands to ensure you can clean in hard to reach places.\nShark vacuums tend to have larger dust canisters than most of Dyson\u2019s models, but the battery doesn\u2019t last as long. So are they better? It very much depends on the layout of your home and your budget. Read our Shark vs Dyson article for a more in-depth look at the two floor-cleaning brands.\nHow we tested these vacuum cleaners\n\u2705 We've tested over 185 vacuums and robot vacuums\n\u2705 We reviewed 41 new vacuums in total over 2024\n\u2705 9 years of vacuum testing experience\nAt TechRadar, we test dozens of vacuum cleaners each year. We cover a range of cleaner types \u2013 from cordless stick vacuums, to upright vacuums, to handheld vacs and robot vacuums \u2013 at a range of price points and from different brands. Each model included here has been put through its paces either by a member of the TechRadar Homes team or by one of our trusted freelance reviewers.\nOur reviews are underpinned by a set of specific, standardized tests. Here's a quick rundown of our vacuum cleaner review process.\nSuction tests\nThese are designed to test how well the vacuum can suck up different kinds of debris on different floors. For fine debris, we sprinkle a teabag's worth of loose, dry tea on a carpet or carpet-like rug, and see how many passes are needed to clear it. We'll start on the vacuum's lowest setting, then increase until there's no mess left.\nTo see how the vacuum handles chunkier debris, we run the same test using a handful of oats. We'll then repeat both tests on hard floor.\nThe final suction test is to see how well the vacuum handles hair \u2013 both human and pet. We'll see how effectively the main floorhead can pull hair from both carpet and hard flooring, and test any hair-specific detail tools on furniture too. We'll also check to see if it ends up tangled around the roller or is effectively diverted into the dust cup.\nBattery tests\nIf the vacuum is cordless, we'll record how long it lasts on a single charge, on each available suction setting, plus how long it takes to recharge. For corded vacuums, we note how long the cable is and if it's generous enough not to be too much of a hindrance while cleaning.\nGeneral tests\nTo get a feel for how the vacuum performs in general use, we'll use it regularly over the course of a couple of weeks. We'll report back on how easy it is to maneuver, how usable it is, if there were any unexpected pain points in the design.\nRead more on how we test vacuum cleaners.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "Are Dyson vacuums worth the premium price? After testing most of the leading brands, here's my take\nIf you're wondering whether to invest in a Dyson vacuum, read this first\nIf you stopped people in the street and asked them which brand made the best vacuum cleaners, after plenty of strange looks, I'm willing to bet Dyson would get the most shout-outs. I'm also willing to bet that most people would flag up the price. Dyson has a well-established reputation for making excellent vacuums that are seriously expensive to buy. Today's best Dyson vacuums boast impressive specs and features you won't find anywhere else. So do they justify that high price?\nAs TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in floorcare, I spend a lot of time testing vacuum cleaners from various brands. I've used ultra-budget vacs and vacuums that cost more than a week's holiday; vacuums that offer features no one ever asked for and ones that fail at the most basic of cleaning tasks.\nHere's my take on how Dyson sits within the wider market. Focusing on Dyson's cordless vacuums in particular, these are the places where the brand shines, where it falls down \u2013 and ultimately, if these high-tech vacuums are worth the investment...\n1. They're meticulously engineered\nI've dealt with plenty of vacuum cleaner brands, and Dyson consistently impresses me with how it designs and engineers its products. I've visited Dyson's UK development labs where the vacuums are designed, seen the tests that are being run on the prototype models, and listened to various engineers nerding out about the intricacies of how the vacuums operate and the new features they've developed. It's clear there's plenty of passion, commitment and skill there.\nThe brand is also relatively slow and purposeful with its new releases (we haven't had a new flagship launch since 2022), and it feels like there's real thought going into each product before it hits the market. Some of that might just be great PR, and of course a slow release schedule doesn't necessarily mean an amazing product, but in general I always feel like I'm in capable hands when dealing with Dyson.\n2. Dyson is still at the cutting edge of innovation\nThere's plenty of copycatting going on in vacuum cleaner land, but Dyson still has some features that no one has managed to replicate.\nThe best example here is the laser built into its Fluffy floorheads. The cleaner head shoots out a precisely angled beam of light to cast big shadows on even tiny specs of dust on hard floors, highlighting just how much you're missing on your cleaning runs. It's a rare case of something that both sounds incredibly cool and also happens to be genuinely useful.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLots of brands have fitted headlamps onto their vacuums, but they're really very different to Dyson's lasers in practice. Those LED lights simply brighten dingy corners of carpet, which can be fairly helpful, but they're unlikely to help you spot anything smaller than a cornflake.\nAnother great innovation is the particle size counter that appears in the V15 Detect and Gen5detect, where you can see exactly what's being sucked up as you go about your cleaning. Plenty of brands offer automatic suction adjustment, but Dyson is the only one to show you exactly what's going on under the hood, in a colorful and nicely-presented bar graph. Whether this feature is strictly necessary is another matter.\n3. They remain the best for maneuverability...\nFor my money, Dyson remains the brand to beat when it comes to outright maneuverability. Its stick vacuums have dragonfly-like mobility, with floorheads that can pivot smoothly any which way, to get into the tightest, most awkward corners. They can also lie completely flat to the ground. It's just a shame Dyson's stick vacuums aren't always the lightest, but I'll get onto that in a second.\nWhile Shark's MultiFLEX / Flexology technology \u2013 where the wand can be released and bend forward to 90-degrees for cleaning under furniture \u2013 seems popular, I find it makes everything just a little too wobbly. I'd take Dyson's setup over Shark's any day (I have a separate guide dedicated to my thoughts on Shark vs Dyson vacuums, if you're interested in how these brands match up in particular).\n4... but they're not the most comfortable to use\nSometimes, I think Dyson has prioritized cutting-edge features and advanced tech at the expense of comfort and usability. They seem to be getting ever heavier \u2013 the brand redesigned the motor and improved the battery for the newest Gen5, and while the suction and runtimes are excellent, the payoff is that the handheld unit is noticeably very heavy for a stick vacuum. So much so, it might be a deal-breaker for some people.\nThe Dyson V11 and newer models are arranged with the wand, motor and dust cup in a straight line, for maximum suction efficiency. The downside is that the filter and motor casing projects out above the handle and can press awkwardly on your hand and arm as you clean. In favor of cleaner lines, the handle isn't ergonomically shaped either; I was particularly struck by this when comparing the Samsung Bespoke AI Jet Ultra vs Dyson Gen5detect.\nHowever, the thing that annoys me most about Dyson's vacuums is that many of them still have trigger operation with no lock for continuous running. The brand has solved the issue with the newest models (the Gen5detect and V12 Detect Slim both switch on and off with a one-press button), but there are still plenty of older options in the current range that require you to awkwardly hold down a trigger the whole time you're cleaning.\n5. The cleaning power is much of a muchness\nWhile Dyson's vacuums might technically be more efficient, and offer more suction, on test we find a lot of vacuums offer a similar level of cleaning power in practice. So when you get it into your home, you might find your floors look just as clean after using a mega-bucks Dyson as they would have done with, say, a Dreame R20 or Shark Detect Pro Cordless. Unless you're dealing with high volumes of dirt or deep pile carpets for instance, you probably aren't going to need the best-of-the-best when it comes to suction.\n6. They won't necessarily last any longer\nIt's perhaps logical to assume that costs more = lasts longer. To a certain extent that's true \u2013 and definitely if you're thinking of dipping into the low-budget end of the market. The cheap vacuums I had purchased before I started this job could barely lift loose dust from a hard floor after a year of use, and one had a filter cover that couldn't physically be removed.\nHowever, as a wider comment that's not specific to Dyson vacuums: more tech and tighter margins for error also tends to introduce more potential points of failure. It's also worth flagging that modern cordless stick vacuums aren't built to last anywhere near as long as a traditional corded upright (I get into it more in my article exploring how long a vacuum cleaner should last).\nThe clunky bagged and corded upright my mum inherited from my grandmother is still going strong after over two decades of use \u2013 longer than any cordless vacuum I've heard of, regardless of brand or price.\nYou might also like...\n- Dyson's new vacuum is as thin as a broom handle and appears to float across the floor\n- Dyson vacuum cleaner tools guide: what each tool does, and which ones you need\n- Browse the best Shark vacuum cleaners on the market\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "Dyson just made the world's slimmest vacuum cleaner \u2013 and after trying it out, I can never go back to a regular stick vac\nThe PencilVac is one smooth mover\nLast month, Dyson unveiled the PencilVac \u2013 a new addition to brand's floorcare lineup, and apparently the world's slimmest vacuum cleaner. Yesterday, I had a chance to try one out, and it turns out this odd-looking vac is one heck of a smooth mover.\nThe PencilVac looks nothing like your standard cordless stick vacuum. The motor, filters and dust cup are all hidden within the broom-like handle, which clocks in at a diminutive 1.5 inches / 3.8cm in diameter. The floorhead is equally surprising, with its four cone-shaped, fluffy rollers.\nLess obvious from the press photos is just how maneuverable this cleaner is. The cleaner head can swivel on the spot and it cleans from the front and from the back sides. Like all the best Dyson vacuums, it can lie flat to the ground, and because the handle is symmetrical, you can hold it from any side, too. You can do figure-eights on your floor if you can get your angles right.\nThe maneuverability is impressive, but there are plenty more cool features besides. The 'QuadConical' floorhead is new on this machine, and designed so that if it encounters long hair, it'll make its way to the narrow end of the cone and pop out as a bundle on the side, at which point it can be easily vacuumed up. The soft material is perfect for delicate hard floors, and the cones protrude out from the casing so you can clean right into the corners, and even give your baseboards a bit of a dust as you go.\nDyson has added its distinctive green laser (which first appeared on the Dyson V15 Detect) to the cleaner head. This helps cast shadows on debris on the floor, so you don't miss even the tiniest speck of dirt. Here, it's located in the center of both sides of the floorhead, and it's just as useful as ever.\nWho's the PencilVac for?\nWhile Dyson says the PencilVac can be used on carpet, it's really specialized for hard floors. The fluffy rollers are perfect for hard floors and the laser really comes into its own on a solid surface.\nWhile it looks like a strong contender for TechRadar's best vacuum for hardwood floor roundup, the soft rollers won't agitate the fibers enough to offer a deep clean on carpet. The suction is also much lower than you'll find on the main flagship range \u2013 partly due to the motor and partly due to the more open floorhead design.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFor many, it'll be a complimentary machine rather than your main vacuum, but if you want something for quick cleanups on hard floors, the PencilVac looks perfect. Full review to follow when I've had a chance to put it through its paces properly.\nAt time of writing, I don't have any pricing information for the PencilVac, but I know it's scheduled to go on sale in Australia in August 2025, before hitting the US and UK markets sometime in 2026. If you can't wait that long, you could check out the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which is a \u2013 for our money, underrated \u2013 scaled-down vacuum for smaller homes.\nYou might also like...\nRuth is TechRadar's Homes Editor specializing in air (vacuum cleaners, fans, air purifiers), and hair (hair dryers, straighteners and stylers).

      "text": "I tried vacuuming my desktop with it and I can't imagine how much dust my desktop has. Because I often do house cleaning, I always thought I was doing pretty well, until I used Dreame's Blue LED vacuum cleaner and I noticed that no matter whether you clean every day or not, there will be a lot of dust in the house that is difficult to detect with the naked eye!This vacuum cleaner is not only useful for blue light, but its suction is very strong. I think it can also be used to clean carpets in an ideal state. It is difficult for ordinary vacuum cleaners to achieve such a strong suction. But with this one from Dreame, I'm not at all concerned that it won't clean my house or floors.It comes with a complete set of brushes, not only can I clean hard floors, I can also use it to clean my carpets, sofas, and even bedding.The whole design is very chic, the pole is made of carbon fiber, which looks very premium, and I believe this material also makes it more durable and lighter.Secondly, this is a very friendly product for pet families. Whether you have a cat or a dog at home, it can clean up perfectly. It does an excellent job of cleaning up the hair that is stuck to the sofa. If the cat or dog is not afraid of its sound, I think it can even be used to clean up the cat or dog's floating hair.For its noise, my family used Dyson V8 before. Compared with the two products, the noise is about the same."

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the polarized opinions surrounding Dyson vacuum cleaners, particularly in light of a viral social media thread criticizing their effectiveness for serious cleaning. The author, a vacuum expert, argues that the issues many have with Dyson vacuums stem from the limitations of cordless stick vacuums in general, such as shorter lifespans and limited suction power compared to traditional models. While Dyson vacuums excel in convenience and maneuverability, the article suggests that for heavy-duty cleaning, especially on carpets, traditional corded models may still be superior.",
