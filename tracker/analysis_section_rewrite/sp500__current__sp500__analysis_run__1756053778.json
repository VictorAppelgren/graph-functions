      "feedback": "Strengths to preserve: you anchor the 0–3 week view to concrete events (I2SJU04DF) and flag spillovers via Red Sea shipping and energy channels, with a cautious read on risk sentiment from the Moscow incident (NBX9RA9WX). However, the draft blends two distinct regimes (Middle East escalation and a domestic gas‑blast) and adds a tangential tech‑platform note (3G1PVPWPD) that dilutes the risk‑transmission logic. Revisions should tighten the causal chain, calibrate immediacy, and sharpen the monitoring toolkit using only the cited sources; reconcile the casualty signals (I2SJU04DF says no casualties; NBX9RA9WX says at least one killed) and treat it as a data‑quality caveat rather than a pillar of the base case.\n\nActionable edits and structure guidance:\n- Reframe to a crisp 0–3 week forecast with three concrete blocks: (a) Immediate drivers and newsflow (cite I2SJU04DF); (b) Near‑term catalysts/positioning dynamics (focus on the new Houthi missile with sub‑munitions and the Israeli strikes on Red Sea targets as catalysts; note the 2,000 km strike radius and asset targets from I2SJU04DF); (c) Transmission and reaction function (risk premia, energy/shipping pressures, and cross‑asset spillovers; cite the same source). Explicitly include the casualty signal as a data point with a note on conflicting reports (I2SJU04DF vs NBX9RA9WX).\n- Remove or tightly connect the peripheral YouTube Music/tech‑platform narrative (3G1PVPWPD) to the risk framework; if kept, recast as a secondary “digital economy risk sentiment” channel with a single explicit citation and no extraneous claims about consumer behavior.\n- Quantify with the strongest numeric anchors from the sources: include the 2,000 km distance for the furthest Houthi target cited in I2SJU04DF; quote the stated target set (presidential palace area, two power plants, fuel depot, Red Sea ports) to anchor potential disruption footprints; explicitly flag the conflicting casualty signal and give a date reference to NBX9RA9WX and I2SJU04DF.\n- Make the trigger/invalidations explicit: (1) Trigger for escalation: fresh Houthi or Israeli strikes on key Red Sea nodes or a credible statement of expanded naval/port disruption; (2) Trigger for de‑risk: de‑escalation/ceasefire or credible reduction in Red Sea shipping disruptions; (3) Invalidation: if latest reports confirm no material damage or if UKMTO/port logs show minimized throughput impact for a defined window (tie to I2SJU04DF’s account of targets and NBX9RA9WX’s casualty signal).\n- Sharpen the monitoring checklist: new strikes/ceasefire declarations; UKMTO advisories or port/ship activity shifts; energy price signals and any shipping‑cost indicators; casualty updates with date stamps; and note any domestic risk sentiment shifts from major safe‑haven moves if the casualty picture firms up (cite I2SJU04DF and NBX9RA9WX).\n- Align with SECTION FOCUS: clearly state the horizon, the immediate drivers, the near‑term catalysts, and the expected reaction function; give a concise, quantifiable threshold set (where feasible) and a short “watch next” line at the end.\n- Citations: attach IDs after each claim that rests on them, e.g., (I2SJU04DF) for the escalation/targets; (NBX9RA9WX) for the casualty data and Moscow risk signal; (3G1PVPWPD) only for the isolated digital‑economy note or remove entirely; if casualty data remains conflicting, present as “early reports” with date stamps and both IDs to acknowledge reconciliation (I2SJU04DF; NBX9RA9WX).\n\nIn short, tighten the causal chain, drop or tightly anchor the extraneous tech piece, explicitly resolve casualty data conflicts, and fix a concrete, monitorable threshold framework anchored in the two primary sources (I2SJU04DF and NBX9RA9WX) with clear near‑term catalysts and invalidation conditions.",
