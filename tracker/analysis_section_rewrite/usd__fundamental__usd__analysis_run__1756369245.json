      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Depth & Clarity of Reasoning**  \n   - *Issue*: The draft mixes multiple themes (soy moratorium, USD dynamics, radar, Japanese banks, Trump‑Putin summit) without a clear hierarchy or focus.  \n   - *Action*: Separate the analysis into distinct sections, each with a concise thesis statement. Use bullet‑style causal chains (policy → cost → price → trade) and illustrate each with a simple diagram or numbered list.  \n   - *Example*: “Policy → Production Cost → Price → Export Volume → Futures Premium.”  \n\n2. **Alignment with SECTION FOCUS (multi‑year structural)**  \n   - *Issue*: The draft briefly mentions “long‑run invariant anchor” but does not articulate a clear structural regime or transition condition.  \n   - *Action*: Explicitly state the baseline regime (e.g., Brazil’s export‑driven soybean economy with a 2006 moratorium) and the new regime (regulated export with environmental compliance). Define the transition trigger (court ruling) and the expected path (price floor rise, supply elasticity shift).  \n   - *Add*: Quantify the supply elasticity (e.g., 0.3‑0.5) from academic literature or recent Brazilian data.  \n\n3. **First‑Principles Grounding**  \n   - *Issue*: References to “real rate differential” and “risk premium” are made without linking to underlying macro fundamentals.  \n   - *Action*: Anchor each invariant in a first‑principles framework:  \n     - **Real Rate Differential** → PPP & capital flows.  \n     - **Terms‑of‑Trade** → soybean price vs. commodity basket.  \n     - **BoP & Net External Position** → Brazil’s current account surplus.  \n     - **Policy Reaction Function** → Fed’s Taylor rule.  \n   - Provide equations or simple algebraic expressions where appropriate.  \n\n4. **Quantification & Numbers**  \n   - *Issue*: The draft uses vague terms (“tighter moratorium”, “higher returns abroad”) and lacks concrete ranges.  \n   - *Action*:  \n     - Cite Brazil’s 2024 soybean export volume (97 Mt) and price (≈US$15/MT).  \n     - Estimate the moratorium’s effect on supply: a 5‑10 % reduction in annual growth.  \n     - For USD: provide current Fed policy rate (5.25 %), expected cut probability (79 % → 1‑2 % chance).  \n     - For Japanese banks: AUM share outside Japan (≈12 % of 120.7 T yen).  \n     - For the Trump‑Putin summit: potential commodity price lift (oil +10‑15 % if peace).  \n\n5. **Citation Density & Correctness**  \n   - *Issue*: No in‑text citations; the draft references “J54PXL0NV” etc. but not linked to specific facts.  \n   - *Action*: Use inline citations in the format `[ID]`. For example: “Brazil exported 97 Mt in 2024 [J54PXL0NV]”.  \n   - Ensure every key claim (e.g., 344 % soybean cultivation growth, 69 % deforestation decline) is cited.  \n   - Cross‑check conflicting data (e.g., 96.8 Mt vs. 97 Mt) and reconcile by stating the source and range.  \n\n6. **Causal Chain & Market Transmission**  \n   - *Issue*: The chain from policy to market pricing is implied but not explicitly mapped.  \n   - *Action*: Create a step‑by‑step flow:  \n     1. Court reinstates moratorium → export restriction.  \n     2. Supply constraint → upward pressure on domestic price.  \n     3. Higher price → increased futures premium and export revenue.  \n     4. Revenue boost → improved current account → BoP adjustment.  \n   - Repeat similar structure for USD dynamics and Japanese banks.  \n\n7. **Specificity of Catalysts / Triggers / Invalidation**  \n   - *Issue*: The draft mentions “political interference” and “trade friction” but does not list concrete triggers.  \n   - *Action*:  \n     - **Catalysts**: Court ruling, Fed policy meeting, Trump’s Cook resignation, EU tariff.  \n     - **Triggers**: Fed’s next rate decision, EU‑US trade negotiations, Brazil’s deforestation data release.  \n     - **Invalidation**: If the moratorium is partially lifted, or if the Fed cuts rates unexpectedly, adjust the model accordingly.  \n\n8. **Length & Format Constraints**  \n   - *Issue*: The draft is too long for a single paragraph.  \n   - *Action*: Condense each section into 2‑3 sentences, totaling 4‑5 paragraphs. Use bullet points for key numbers.  \n\n9. **Overall Coherence**  \n   - *Issue*: The draft jumps between unrelated topics.  \n   - *Action*: Focus on one primary theme per analysis (e.g., soybean market). If multiple themes are necessary, clearly separate them and avoid mixing causal chains.  \n\n**Revised Outline (example)**  \n1. **Brazilian Soy Moratorium – Structural Shift**  \n   - Baseline regime, transition trigger, invariant anchors, quantitative impact.  \n2. **USD Dynamics – Fed Policy & Political Risk**  \n   - Real rate differential, risk premium, expected channel.  \n3. **Japanese Banks – Global Asset‑Management Expansion**  \n   - Domestic slowdown, policy reforms, capital flow implications.  \n4. **Geopolitical Risk – Trump‑Putin Summit**  \n   - Commodity price sensitivity, currency risk premia, scenario analysis.  \n\nApply the above edits to produce a concise, citation‑rich, first‑principles‑driven analysis that meets the SECTION FOCUS and length constraints.",
