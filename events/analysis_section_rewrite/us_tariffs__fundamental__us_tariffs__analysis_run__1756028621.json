      "feedback": "Strong effort to fuse policy signals across tariffs, deregulation, and semiconductor policy, but to reach world‑class quality you should recast into a rigorous, regime‑based framework with explicit first‑principles anchors and a quantified transmission chain. Actionable edits: 1) add invariant anchors (real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP, policy reaction functions) and define regimes (baseline tariff framework with 15% across most EU goods and carve‑outs; potential wine/steel/inventory exemptions; a separate deregulation/ownership regime via Unleashing Prosperity; and a chip‑subsidy equity‑stake regime). State transition conditions (e.g., legal challenges resolving within 12–24 months, steel‑quota talks closing vs dragging, EU exempt/deny timelines) and link them to market pricing via causal chains (cost pass‑through, import costs, input prices, capital allocation, onshore‑shoring incentives). 2) strengthen the causal chain with explicit channels and timing: tariffs raise import costs and can be passed to consumers or absorbed by firms; chip subsidies/possible equity stake alter government incentives and risk premia; potential new chip tariffs raise relative costs of non‑U.S. silicon; deregulation changes execution risk and regulatory certainty; spillovers into adjacent sectors (auto, steel, consumer goods) via Adyen‑style cross‑border flows and supply chains (cite RHFWI02JT, 5M9M1KACF, QRX2HD4X0, 2SJORBV6H). 3) quantify where possible: anchor the analysis with concrete numbers (15% across most EU goods; wine unresolved but likely a 15% path; steel tariff quotas under negotiation; CHIPS Act subsidies of about $7.8B and a possible 10% equity stake; potential chip tariffs up to 300%; Adyen H1 2025 metrics: net revenue +20%, EBITDA +28%, etc.; Yale Budget Lab 1.8% short‑term price rise; 18.6% average tariff; wine/industry hit estimates) and explicitly translate these into base‑case price and capex implications for Intel and suppliers. 4) build a clear base case plus alternate paths: base case with credible timing for EU exemptions/steel quotas and CHIPS disbursement; upside if subsidies accelerate capacity and tariff risk remains contained; downside if legal challenges defeat deregulatory momentum or if tariff escalations widen. 5) address conflicts and reconciliations across sources: acknowledge that AP/ Fortune narratives emphasize broad tariff frameworks with nonbinding elements (RHFWI02JT); Reuters/AP inflation spillovers and industry pass‑through (2SJORBV6H, 2nd AP piece) can imply higher price dynamics; while the deregulation/competition literature (9W8ZUIBDY, 4th/5th Forbes pieces) highlights significant policy risk to stability; explicitly state where a given number is a main transmission channel vs a potential tail risk. 6) improve scenario structure and triggers: specify catalysts (final EU exemptions, steel‑quota terms, timing of CHIPS disbursement, any equity‑related announcements with Intel, new chip tariffs, cross‑border volumes shifts per Adyen), and invalidation events (court rulings overturning tariffs or regulatory orders, CRA/REINS progress stalling, or rapid policy reversals). 7) tighten formatting and citations: ensure every factual pillar is anchored to the IDs provided and consistently cited (RHFWI02JT for US‑EU framework; 5M9M1KACF for Intel/CHIPS equity talk; 9W8ZUIBDY for deregulation order; QRX2HD4X0 for Adyen macro link; 2SJORBV6H for Japan anti‑dumping). 8) add a concise “What to watch next” grid with 3–5 items and a one‑line implication for Intel’s valuation/risk; conclude with a calibrated confidence level and a short range of potential wealth‑impact paths. Incorporating these edits will convert the draft into a rigorous, multi‑year, first‑principles, regime‑based analysis with explicit catalysts, invalidation points, and a transparent numeric base case aligned to the source material.",
