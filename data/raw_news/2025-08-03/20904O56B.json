  "description": "A newly released image showed killer Bryan Kohberger just moments after his parents' home was raided and he was arrested for murdering four innocent University of Idaho students.",
  "content": "A never-before-seen image of convicted killer Bryan Kohberger has shown the moment he knew he was caught for the gruesome deaths of four innocent Idaho college students.\n\nThe 30-year-old criminology Ph.D student murdered Madison Mogen, 21, Ethan Chapin, 20 Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Xana Kernodle, 20, on November 13, 2022 after sneaking into their home in Moscow.\n\nFor about a month, police searched for the person responsible - until December 30 when they nabbed Kohberger.\n\nThe image, which showed the twisted killer donning a stone-faced expression at one of the arresting officers, was taken after authorities stormed his parents' home in Pennsylvania.\n\nHe looked directly at the camera as he sat down, wearing a black hoodie and black shorts with his hands restrained behind his back.\n\n'I'll never forget - my phone dinged and I looked at it and it said, \"We got him,\"' Moscow Police Chief Anthony Dahlinger told ABC News.\n\n'The next thing on, there was a picture of him in handcuffs from the scene.'\n\nDahlinger recalled the sense of 'relief' he felt in that moment, adding: 'So being able to share that information with the community, I can only imagine that many of us in the community felt the same when we knew we had him.'\n\nJust before his arrest, it appeared Kohberger was 'sorting through garbage, with gloves on,' Idaho State Police Lt. Darren Gilbertson, a lead investigator in the blockbuster case, told the outlet.\n\nHe was among those who interviewed Kohberger the day of his arrest, as he recalled the murderer being 'expressionless.'\n\nDespite his demeanor, which has been on full display since the tragedy made headlines three years ago, Gilbertson said he noticed Kohberger still liked to 'speak to you and teach and enlighten you' during his interview.\n\n'We started with just very general questions about Pullman, about WSU ... he spoke at length about that with us,' the detective recollected.\n\nThe murderer went on to ask Gilbertson why he was being interviewed, but when he found it was related to the fatal stabbings in Moscow, he stopped talking.\n\n'As soon as we mentioned that, then he stopped, and he said, \"I don't want to talk anymore\",' Gilbertson said.\n\n'We asked if he was familiar with it, if he knew anything about Moscow, and he said, no ... and stopped right then and said he wanted an attorney.'\n\nKohberger was sentenced to life in prison on July 23 as the victims' families spoke directly to him with their emotional and powerful impact statements.\n\nHe was handed four life sentences for each death plus 10 more years for the burglary charge related to the murders.\n\nHe was supposed to stand trial for the deaths that would have seen him possibly get the death penalty, but just weeks before his sentencing Kohberger entered a plea deal.\n\nInstead of getting the death penalty, he will now remain locked behind bars for the rest of his life.\n\nHe is being held in the 'J' block of the Idaho Maximum Security Institution near Boise - the most restricted prisons in the area.\n\nFollowing his sentencing, a trove of investigation documents were released by the Moscow Police Department.\n\nWithin the lengthy documents, it was sadly revealed how one of the victim's, Goncalves, was so badly injured by Kohberger's knife that she looked 'unrecognizable' by the time he claimed her life.\n\n'I was unable to comprehend exactly what I was looking at while trying to discern the nature of the injuries,' a cop wrote in the files.\n\nGoncalves was stabbed a total of 34 times, with many of those wounds left on her face at the student home.\n\nUnlike Kohberger's other three victims, who only had stab wounds, Golcalves also suffered blunt force injuries.\n\nAnother officer on the scene described seeing Kernodle's body in her bedroom covered in blood, with defensive wounds to her hands, including a deep gash between her finger and thumb. She was stabbed more than 50 times.\n\n'It was obvious an intense struggle had occurred,' the officer wrote. 'There was blood smeared on various items in the room and all over the floor.'\n\nKernodle's boyfriend Chapin was found partially covered with a blanket in her bed, with his jugular severed, the police files said.\n\nOn the floor above, officers found the bodies of Mogen and Goncalves. Mogen had wounds to her forearm, hands and a gash from her right eye to her nose.\n\nBoth were covered in blood, which had soaked the pink blanket they were sharing.\n\nKohberger left behind a Ka-Bar leather knife sheath next to Mogen's body. DNA on the clasp was traced back to the killer using Investigative Genetic Genealogy.",

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger seen moments after arrest in newly released photo\nBryan Kohberger has been sentenced to four life sentences plus 10 years.\nA newly released picture shows University of Idaho murderer Bryan Kohberger moments after his arrest in the high-profile slayings.\nKohberger, a criminology Ph.D. student at Washington State University in Pullman at the time of the November 2022 killings, was at his parents' home in eastern Pennsylvania when he was arrested on the morning of Dec. 30, 2022.\nKohberger is currently being housed in the \"J\" block of the Idaho Maximum Security Institution near Boise, which is considered long term-restrictive housing -- the most restrictive area -- ABC News has learned.\nIt appeared Kohberger was \"sorting through garbage, with gloves on, just shortly before the arrest occurred,\" Idaho State Police Lt. Darren Gilbertson told ABC News.\nThe photo shows the now-convicted killer staring at the camera, wearing black shorts and a hooded sweatshirt with his hands behind his back.\n\"I'll never forget -- my phone dinged and I looked at it and it said, 'We got him,'\" current Moscow Police Chief Anthony Dahlinger told ABC News of that moment. \"The next thing on, there was a picture of him in handcuffs from the scene.\"\n\"I can't describe the relief that washed over in that moment,\" Dahlinger said. \"So being able to share that information with the community, I can only imagine that many of us in the community felt the same when we knew that we had him.\"\nGilbertson, the lead investigator, was among the authorities who interviewed Kohberger that day.\nHe described Kohberger as \"expressionless,\" but said the former criminology student liked to \"speak to you and teach and enlighten you.\"\n\"We started with just very general questions about Pullman, about WSU ... he spoke at length about that with us,\" Gilbertson said.\nGilbertson said Kohberger asked several times why he was being interviewed.\nGilbertson said he eventually told the suspect, \"We're here because of the case in Moscow.\"\n\"As soon as we mentioned that, then he stopped, and he said, 'I don't want to talk anymore.' We asked if he was familiar with it, if he knew anything about Moscow, and he said, no ... and stopped right then and said he wanted an attorney,\" Gilbertson said.\nHe said police left that interview feeling like they \"had their guy.\"\nKohberger was sentenced last week to four life sentences plus 10 years after pleading guilty to all charges in the murders of Kaylee Goncalves, Maddie Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin. The four students were stabbed to death at the girls' home on Nov. 13, 2022. Moscow police said they don't know which victim was the specific target and have not found any link between Kohberger and the victims."

Listen here\nBryan Kohberger has finally been sentenced to life in prison for the murders of four Idaho students after a judge slammed his 'grotesque acts of evil.'\nJudge Stephen Hippler pulled no punches at a Boise courthouse Wednesday as he ordered Kohberger, 30, to be held in custody by the Idaho Department of Corrections until his death over the November 2022 murders of four young students.\n'His grotesque acts of evil have buried and hidden anything that might have been good or intrinsically human about him,' Hippler told a hushed courtroom, shortly after wiping a tear from his eye.\n'I'm unable to come up with anything redeemable about Mr Kohberger.'\n'His actions have made him the worst of the worst. Even in pleading he guilty, he has given nothing hinting of remorse or redemption, nothing suggesting even a recognition or understanding, let alone regret, for the pain he has caused.\n'I will now sentence him so that he is forever removed from civilized society.'\nKohberger was handed four life sentences for each life he took - one for Madison Mogen, a second for Kaylee Goncalves, a third for Ethan Chapin and the final one for Xana Kernodle.\nA plea deal struck earlier this month saw Kohberger spared the death penalty, but he will never be able to apply for parole.\nJudge Stephen Hippler, pictured at the Ada County Courthouse in Boise, Idaho, Wednesday, grew emotional before sentencing Idaho murders killer Bryan Kohberger to life without parole\nBryan Kohberger is seen in court Wednesday where he was sentenced to die behind bars\nEarlier in Wednesday's sentencing, Kohberger was asked if he'd like to address the court, with the criminology student's motive still a mystery.\n'I respectfully decline,' he said in a frighteningly forceful voice.\nKohberger sat impassively as his sentence was passed. The initial part of the hearing had seen the families of his victims confront him.\nThat saw them share their desire for Kohberger to be raped and attacked in prison.\nJudge Hippler addressed Kohberger's continued silence on the shocking bloodbath against four innocent strangers.\nHe also shared his disgust at the thought of the killer collaborating on a book or movie about his crimes while behind bars.\nThe judge added: 'I desire the answers \u2026 to why but on reflection\u2026 to continue to focus on why we continue to give Mr Kohberger relevance, to give him power.\n'Do we really believe after all this he is capable of speaking the truth?\n'There is no reason for these crimes that resemble rationality.\n'No conceivable reason could make any sense.\n'And in the end the more we seek explanation for the unexplainable... the more power and control we give to him.\n'It's time to end Mr Kohberger's 15 minutes of fame,' he said.\nPictured left to right: Housemates Dylan Mortensen, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen (on Kaylee's shoulders) Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Bethany Funke in 2022\nMogen, Kernodle, Goncalves and Chapin were found stabbed to death on Nov. 13, 2022 in their shared home on King Road in Moscow, Idaho. Pictured is the home in December 2023\nA member of the audience could be heard shouting 'coward' after Kohberger declined to address the court, according to reporters in the room.\nHe stood up to address the judge moments before he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, after the friends and relatives of his victims gave heartbreaking impact statements to the court.\nSurviving roommate Dylan Mortensen sobbed as she addressed the 30-year-old killer, and described him as 'less than human.'\nThe sister of victim Kaylee Goncalves, Alivea, then delivered a searing statement, demanding he explain himself and tearing him down as a 'loser.'\nShe demanded Kohberger 'sit up straight' while she spoke and called him a 'delusional, pathetic, hypochondriac.'\n'The truth about Kaylee and Maddie is that they would have been kind to you\u2026. In a world that rejected you, they would have shown mercy,' Kaylee Goncalves' sister Alivea began as she spoke to Bryan Kohberger directly.\nKohberger watched Alivea intently, showing no emotion or flicker of expression.\nThe sister of victim Kaylee Goncalves, Alivea, delivered a searing statement at the sentencing Tuesday, demanding Kohberger explain himself and tearing him down as a 'loser'\nSurviving roommate Dylan Mortensen sobbed as she addressed the 30-year-old killer, and described him as 'less than human'\nBryan Kohberger is seen being led out of court Wednesday after being handed four life sentences for each life he took - one for Madison Mogen, a second for Kaylee Goncalves, a third for Ethan Chapin and the final one for Xana Kernodle\nAlivea continued in her scathing remarks to Kohberger: 'I wont stand her and give you what you want, I won't give you tears\u2026 instead I will call you what you are: sociopath, psychopath, murderer.'\nShe then hit him with the very same questions that Kohberger posed in a survey on Reddit as part of his criminology degree at DeSales University.\nShe went on to blast Kohberger's past and all his failings, saying: 'You thought you were so much better than everyone else.'\n'The truth is you're basic,' she continued. 'You're a textbook case as insecurity disguised as control. You spent months preparing and still all it took was my sister and a sheath.'\n'You're as dumb as they come. Stupid, dumb\u2026 weak, dirty.'\nIn a damning conclusion, she told Kohberger: 'If you hadn't attacked them in your sleep like a pedophile, Kaylee would have kicked your f****** a**.'\nThe courtroom erupted in clapping at the end of Alivea's statement.\n'This world was a better place with her in it,' said Scott Laramie, Mogen's stepfather.\n'As for the defendant, we will not waste the words. Nor will we fall into hatred and bitterness.\n'Evil has many faces, and we now know this, but evil does not deserve our time and attention. We are done being victims. We are taking back our lives.'\nBryan Kohberger is pictured in a selfie on November 13, 2022, taken just hours after he carried out the quadruple murder\nOn the night of the murder, Kohbeger's car could be seen on a neighbor's surveillance camera speeding away so fast 'the car almost loses control as it makes the corner\nMogen, Kernodle, Goncalves and Chapin were found stabbed to death on Nov. 13, 2022 in their shared home on King Road in Moscow, Idaho.\nKohberger was arrested in Pennsylvania, where his parents lived, in connection to the gruesome slayings roughly six weeks later.\nPolice said they recovered DNA from a knife sheath found at the home, and used genetic genealogy to identify Kohberger as a possible suspect.\nThey accessed cellphone data to pinpoint his movements and used surveillance camera footage to help locate a white sedan that was seen repeatedly driving past the home on the night of the killings.\nA Q-tip from the garbage at his parents' house was used to match Kohberger's DNA to genetic material from the sheath, investigators said.\nThe 30-year-old killer - who spent years studying criminology - pleaded guilty to the quadruple murder earlier this month in a deal to avoid the death penalty.\nKohberger's attorneys got his trial moved to Boise after expressing concerns that the court wouldn't be able to find enough unbiased jurors in Moscow.\nBut Hippler rejected their efforts to get the death penalty taken off the table and to strike critical evidence - including the DNA - from being admitted in trial.\nThe trial had been set to begin next month.\nIn exchange for Kohberger admitting guilt and waiving his right to appeal, prosecutors agreed not to seek his execution. Instead, both sides agreed to recommend that he serve four consecutive life sentences without parole for the killings.\nThe victim's families were split on how they felt about the plea deal.\nBryan Kohberger was pulled over with his father (pictured together) before his arrest\nIf investigators know why Kohberger committed the crime, they haven't said so publicly. Nor is it clear why he spared two roommates who were home at the time.\nCellphone location data did show Kohberger had been in the neighborhood multiple times before the attack.\nLatah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson has said that Kohberger used his knowledge about forensic investigations to attempt to cover his tracks by deep cleaning his vehicle after the crime.\nPolice say Kohberger's Amazon purchase history shows he bought a military-style knife as well as the knife sheath found at the home. But the knife itself was never found.\nThe case drew widespread interest and judges feared the publicity could harm Kohberger's right to a fair trial. A sweeping gag order was imposed and hundreds of court documents were sealed from public view.\nAfter Kohberger pleaded guilty, a coalition of news organizations asked that the gag order be lifted and the case documents be unsealed.\nHippler agreed, but said unsealing the documents will take time and that process won't begin until after the sentencing hearing. It's not clear how many answers they might contain.\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested that the judge should force Kohberger to explain himself.\n'I hope the Judge makes Kohberger, at a minimum, explain why he did these horrible murders,' Trump wrote Monday on his platform Truth Social. 'There are no explanations, there is no NOTHING.'\nFriends and family members have sought to commemorate the victims' lives through charity. The Made With Kindness Foundation honors the legacy of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, and Kernodle through scholarships.
