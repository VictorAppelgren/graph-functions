  "description": "Jamie-Lynn Sigler reveals her 12-year-old son Beau had an emotional reaction to her MS battle after watching 'Forrest Gump' together",
  "content": "Jamie-Lynn Sigler is candidly sharing how her son, Beau, has been affected by her battle with multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nSigler, 44, revealed during the Tuesday, August 26, episode of the \u201cMeSsy\u201d podcast that her 12-year-old son had a heartbreaking reaction to his mom\u2019s illness after they watched the 1994 movie Forrest Gump together.\n\n\u201cBeau is me. So he cried at the times I cried, like, I wasn\u2019t shocked that he would get emotional. But when the movie was done, he kind of buried his head in my chest and just started sobbing,\u201d the Sopranos alum explained. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, buddy. What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018I hate how much you suffer. I hate watching you be sick. I don\u2019t like that this is happening to you.\u2019\u201d\n\nSigler admitted that she \u201cnever thought about that\u201d aspect of her illness before.\n\n\u201cI pride in myself that Beau and I have a very open relationship. And I feel like I\u2019ve set the stage for him to \u2026 express himself or talk about anything with me,\u201d she continued of her eldest son, whom she shares with husband Cutter Dykstra. (The couple also shares son Jack, 7.)\n\n\u201cI guess I just took for granted that he\u2019s only known me with MS, so that he\u2019s just kind of accepted that this is my life,\u201d Sigler, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder at age 20, added. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think about it being that hard for him, the uncertainty of it, and the obvious comparisons that he now has of having a mother with a disability versus one that doesn\u2019t. And it was eye-opening and heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe mom of two said she felt \u201cguilty\u201d that she \u201cdidn\u2019t ever consider that this would be so difficult\u201d for Beau.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so used to dealing with my struggle and my pushing through it daily. I guess I just didn\u2019t think about him noticing it or clocking it or caring about it,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think we assume just our kids are selfish, and \u2026 I just didn\u2019t anticipate that conversation, and it [has] really stuck with me.\u201d\n\nSigler first opened up about her MS battle in 2016, nearly 15 years after she was diagnosed.\n\n\u201cI already had a big career. It was difficult to accept,\u201d she admitted during a Fox News appearance, noting that she decided to speak out because she wanted to be a source of comfort for others who were going through the same thing.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the time when people are dealing with any chronic illness you can feel very isolated, you can feel alone, you feel like people don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be somebody that says, \u2018I get it, I feel you, I hear you, I go through what you go through, and I understand.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Sigler exclusively told Us Weekly about how her illness affects her parenting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m human. Are there days where I wonder, \u2018Would I have been a little bit more patient if I wasn\u2019t struggling physically?\u2019 It makes you question everything in your life. It affects every area of your life,\u201d she shared. \u201cBut I think that when I put my kids to bed and I see the connection that we have and I know that that\u2019s completely unaffected no matter what I physically can or can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nSigler added that Beau is an \u201cempath\u201d who understands her condition, but Jack sometimes struggles with it.\n\n\u201c[Beau is] very sensitive. If I ever apologize [to] him that I can\u2019t do certain things or explain to him certain limitations I have, he\u2019s always like, \u2018Oh, mom, I get it, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all right.\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cMy little one \u2026 he is upset about it, he doesn\u2019t like it. He\u2019ll compare what I can and can\u2019t do to other moms, which is totally OK.\u201d",

      "text": "Jamie-Lynn Sigler is sharing more details about the onset of her multiple sclerosis symptoms.\nDuring the Tuesday, May 7, episode of her and Christina Applegate\u2019s \u201cMeSsy\u201d podcast, Sigler, 42, opened up about a health scare she experienced at age 19, about one year before she was diagnosed with MS.\n\u201cI all of a sudden felt like I had to pee so bad, like a bladder spasm, which I\u2019d never experienced before,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd then I would go to the bathroom and I couldn\u2019t pee.\u201d\nWhile Sigler initially thought she might have a UTI, new symptoms appeared a few days later.\n\u201cI started getting that feeling right before pins and needles, like that heaviness numb. It started in my feet and then every day it was rising. It was in my ankles, in my calves, in my knees, in my thighs,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time it got to my hips, I remember I was on a plane back to New York and I called my dad \u2026 and I said, \u2018You need to pick me up from the airport, something\u2019s wrong. I need you to take me to the hospital.\u2019\u201d\nSigler, who noted that she was \u201cabout to enter into the third season of [The] Sopranos\u201d at the time, then endured a lengthy hospital stay.\n\u201cI was in the ICU for 14 days, nobody could tell me what was wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did a spinal tap, they did an MRI, they ruled out MS at the time. They did every single test you could possibly imagine.\u201d\nSigler \u201crecovered\u201d from the mysterious symptoms after being put on \u201can incredible amount of steroids,\u201d but the numbness returned \u201cabout a year and a half\u201d later. Though she felt like she was \u201cexaggerating\u201d when she insisted on returning to the hospital, Sigler was diagnosed with MS soon after.\n\u201cImmediately, they\u2019re like, \u2018We need to do another spinal tap and MRI.\u2019 And the next morning, I woke up with a neurologist in my room telling me I had MS,\u201d the actress recalled.\nWhen Applegate, 52, questioned whether doctors \u201cmissed\u201d Sigler\u2019s MS the year prior, Sigler offered an explanation.\n\u201cI guess there was no lesions before, it was very early on,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was as obvious to diagnose as it was this time around. There were clear lesions at this point.\u201d\nSigler didn\u2019t share her diagnosis publicly until 2016 when she was 34. \u201cI was told by many people [to] keep it a secret,\u201d she told Applegate, who revealed her own MS diagnosis in 2021.\nBecause Sigler was largely \u201casymptomatic\u201d during the early years of her battle with MS, she was able to avoid coming to terms with the illness.\n\u201cI was a terrible patient, I did not take my medication,\u201d she shared. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t taking care of myself and I was sort of rebelling against the whole thing. And then I went through a very nasty divorce [with ex-husband A.J. DiScala], and in that moment was when my health just went [on] a big downward spiral.\u201d\nSigler, who split from DiScala in 2006 after three years of marriage, went on to marry husband Cutter Dykstra in 2016. The pair share sons Beau, 10, and Jack, 6.\nSigler has spoken candidly about how her health struggles affect her kids.\n\u201cMy oldest son is an empath. He\u2019s very sensitive. If I ever apologize [to] him that I can\u2019t do certain things or explain to him certain limitations I have, he\u2019s always like, \u2018Oh, mom, I get it, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all right,\u2019\u201d she exclusively told Us Weekly in September 2023. \u201cMy little one \u2026 He is upset about it, he doesn\u2019t like it. He\u2019ll compare what I can and can\u2019t do to other moms, which is totally OK.\u201d\nDespite the challenge of raising children while battling MS, Sigler added that nothing can take away from the bond she has with her boys.\n\u201cI think that when I put my kids to bed and I see the connection that we have and I know that that\u2019s completely unaffected no matter what I physically can or can\u2019t do,\u201d she told Us."

It affects every area of your life,\u201d Sigler, 42, exclusively told Us Weekly while promoting her partnership with Novartis. \u201cBut I think that when I put my kids to bed and I see the connection that we have and I know that that\u2019s completely unaffected no matter what I physically can or can\u2019t do.\u201d\nSigler, who was diagnosed with MS when she was in her 20s, shares two sons, Beau, 9, and Jack, 5, with husband, former MLB player Cutter Dykstra. While she admits it\u2019s not easy to be a parent while battling a chronic illness, she is honest with her little ones about her condition.\n\u201cSo my kids both react to it very differently. My oldest son is an empath. He\u2019s very sensitive.

He\u2019ll compare what I can and can\u2019t do to other moms, which is totally OK.\u201d\nWhile her sons have different reactions to their mom\u2019s struggles, Sigler confessed that she admires both of her kiddos for being honest about their feelings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s honest and real and so it\u2019s different the way I have to discuss it with both of them,\u201d she admitted to Us. \u201cBut I am always encouraging them to express their feelings about it because when you live with a chronic illness \u2026 it\u2019s like the whole family has to deal with it. It\u2019s in all of our lives.\u201d\nWhen Sigler isn\u2019t busy with her little ones, she hosts the \u201cNot Today, Pal\u201d podcast with her best friend and former The Sopranos costar Robert Iler.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 30-minute moment of just fun and silliness and him making me uncomfortable and me reacting. People write in and we give our quote \u2018sweet and sour\u2019 advice \u2013 he\u2019s the sour, I\u2019m the sweet, but we also get personal about what we\u2019re dealing with in our life,\u201d she explained to Us. \u201cHe\u2019s a recovering addict. I obviously live with MS, so it\u2019s an opportunity for people to get to know another side of us, to see our relationship and hopefully to make people laugh.\u201d\nSigler continues to advocate for MS and has teamed up with Novartis to create a guide where she reflects on her experience with the condition and how she manages Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS).

When it comes to parenting, Sigler exclusively told Us Weekly that she has different approaches to each child \u2014 and her choices are heavily influenced by her ongoing battle with multiple sclerosis.\n\u201cWhen I put my kids to bed and I see the connection that we have and I know that that\u2019s completely unaffected no matter what I physically can or can\u2019t do,\u201d Sigler said in September 2023, noting that her illness, which she was diagnosed with in her 20s, can sometimes negatively impact her role as a mom.\nSigler explained that when she has an off day, her boys react \u201cvery differently.\u201d The star called her older son, Beau, an \u201cempath,\u201d who is \u201cvery sensitive.\u201d Meanwhile, her younger son, Jack, gets \u201cupset about it\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t like\u201d that Sigler can\u2019t always be like other moms.\n\u201cI am always encouraging them to express their feelings about it because when you live with a chronic illness \u2026 it\u2019s like the whole family has to deal with it,\u201d she told Us. \u201cIt\u2019s in all of our lives.\u201d\nLuckily, Sigler isn\u2019t alone. Scroll down to learn about her support system and all of her family members:\nConnie and Steve Sigler\nJamie-Lynn is the only daughter of mom Connie and dad Steve \u2014 and according to the actress, she\u2019s similar in more ways than one to the family matriarch. \u201cI catch myself all the time, like, \u2018Oh my God, I was just my mother,\u2019 \u201cJamie-Lynn told People in December 2020. \u201cEven my husband and my friends will be like, \u2018Whoa, you were just your mom right there.\u2019\u201d\nConnie teased that her daughter is \u201cvery determined and likes to win an argument. And so do I!\u201d\nAdam Sigler\nUs confirmed in September 2017 that Jamie-Lynn\u2019s eldest brother, Adam, died after suffering a brain hemorrhage. \u201cAdam was always so happy and inspired Jamie to be a better person every day,\u201d an insider told Us at the time. \u201cShe loved him dearly and will miss him more than anyone can ever imagine. The family was with him every second he was in a coma and was surrounded by his entire family when he passed.\u201d\nAdam was a stockbroker before his untimely death.\nBrian Sigler\nBrian is the second oldest child of Connie and Steve, younger than Adam and older than Jamie-Lynn. Not much is known about Brian, but Jamie-Lynn shared a throwback photo with both siblings in July 2020 where they were all dressed up for Jewish synagogue.\nCutter Dykstra\nJamie-Lynn got engaged to Dykstra, who is a former MLB player, in January 2013 after being introduced in 2012. The couple tied the knot in Palm Springs, with their oldest son, Beau, by their sides. (Lance Bass was the officiant.)\n\u201cYou. You. You. It will always be you. Happy birthday to my favorite person in the entire world,\u201d Jamie-Lynn wrote via Instagram in June 2024, celebrating her spouse\u2019s special day. \u201cYou get weirder and wiser and better with age and I couldn\u2019t love you any more. It\u2019s so annoying you are still in your 30\u2019s but you will forever be my old man.\u201d\nBeau Dykstra\nThe couple welcomed their first son, Beau, in August 2013. More than 10 years later, Jamie-Lynn revealed via social media that Beau was hospitalized with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Jamie-Lynn described ADEM as a \u201ca very rare neurological autoimmune response that kids can get to a simple virus like a cold or strep\u201d during an August 2024 appearance on the \u201cMesSy\u201d podcast.\nAfter 33 days in the hospital, Beau was released in August 2024. \u201cMy brave boy, you are a walking miracle,\u201d the actress gushed via Instagram, sharing a video of her son walking out of the hospital on his own.\nJack Dykstra\nJamie-Lynn gave birth to her and Dykstra\u2019s second son, Jack, in January 2018. \u201cHe\u2019s here. Jack Adam Dykstra we will talk about your tardiness eventually, but for now we\u2019ve got a lot of love to give,\u201d she announced the following month. \u201cThanks to my besties for helping me laugh and smile and to my husband for just being my rock.\u201d"

      "text": "TikTok star Grant Gibbs is apologizing after outing Crumbl Cookie cofounder Sawyer Hemsley.\n\u201cHey guys, so I just got word that the Crumbl co-founder just came out,\u201d Gibbs said in a TikTok video shared on Tuesday, August 26. \u201cThis was not my intention to ever out somebody this way, but girl, I\u2019m so happy for you and so proud of you. You are hot and you\u2019re going to live your best open, out, gay life mama. You are chiseled, you are cut, like, it\u2019s going to be such a gag. But you guys, I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen the way it did. I\u2019m so sorry Sawyer.\u201d\nGibbs continued, \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll be fine, girl. You\u2019ve got money, you\u2019ve got beautiful homes, beautiful clothes, and you probably have a gorgeous hole, in a way that\u2019s like, you know what I mean. I wish I could retract what I just said. But you are going to be fine. I think you\u2019re going to do great in this world and I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\nGibbs, who has more than 218,000 TikTok followers, noted that he can \u201cadmit\u201d outing Hemsley was \u201cnasty of me,\u201d but claimed he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean for it to end up like this.\u201d While filming the video as he boarded a New York City subway car, Gibbs quipped at the end, \u201cAt least you don\u2019t gotta ride the subway like the rest of us. So there\u2019s that!\u201d\n@grantegibbs I\u2019m genuinely sorry I clocked your tea in such a massive way, but I am really happy and proud of you sister @Sawyer Hemsley \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f #crumbl #gay #loveislove #comingout #pride\n\u201cI\u2019m genuinely sorry I clocked your tea in such a massive way, but I am really happy and proud of you sister @Sawyer Hemsley \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f,\u201d Gibbs captioned the post.\nGibbs made his first TikTok about Hemsley days prior, where he shared his reaction after watching a video online.\n\u201cThis is my face after watching a video of the Crumbl CEO and seeing that that\u2019s apparently a straight man. No it\u2019s not. That man is so gay. That man is gay to the gods. There\u2019s a genetic component to sexuality mama, and let\u2019s just say he has the gene and there\u2019s no denying evolution, babe. Oh my God, that\u2019s a gay man!\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cThat\u2019s a gay man and I\u2019ll say it to his face. There\u2019s no denying it. Holy s*** \u2026 I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m outing the CEO with millions of dollars, I don\u2019t give a f*** but that\u2019s a gay man.\u201d\nGibbs told his followers to \u201csearch and look it up for yourselves,\u201d captioning the post, \u201cY\u2019all I\u2019m dying \ud83d\ude2d . Can someone fill me in on the tea with him bc I quite literally have never seen a gayer man \ud83d\ude2d.\u201d\nHemsley, for his part, addressed Gibbs\u2019 speculation about his sexuality in a separate post on Tuesday.\n\u201cOver the past little while, there have been people online trying to define me, twist things, and share conversations in ways that feel harmful. Instead of letting others write my story, I want to share it in my own words,\u201d Hemsley began via Instagram.\nHe continued, \u201cThe truth is, over the past few years I\u2019ve come to understand and accept that I\u2019m gay. It\u2019s taken me a long time to really process this part of myself and even longer to feel comfortable enough to say it out loud. For most of my life, I didn\u2019t have the clarity to answer the questions or respond to the rumors. Coming to terms with it has been overwhelming and, at times, scary \u2014 but it has also brought me peace, joy, and authenticity that I wouldn\u2019t trade for anything.\u201d\nHemsley shared that he \u201cgrew up with values and beliefs\u201d that he still \u201cdeeply\u201d loves and respects which \u201cmade this journey more complicated.\u201d\n\u201cBut I remain grateful for my foundation, even as I\u2019ve worked to embrace this truth about myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know some people may have questions or even judgments, but my hope is that kindness, empathy, and love will lead the way. I\u2019ve learned so much through this process \u2014 about strength, compassion, and the importance of living authentically.\u201d\nHe concluded, \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m deeply thankful: for the opportunities I\u2019ve had, for the people who support me, and for the chance to live and share my story. It\u2019s a journey of growth and honesty, and one I\u2019ll never stop being grateful for. With love, Sawyer \u270c\ud83c\udffc.\u201d\nHemsley\u2019s open letter was met with praise from fans and celebrities alike. \u201cShame on anyone forcing you to speak on this. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business but your own, but I applaud your bravery and how you handled this with such grace \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f,\u201d the Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star Jessi Ngatikaura wrote, while Big Brother\u2019s Julie Chen Moonves added, \u201c\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08.\u201d"

      "text": "Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau\u2018s parents, Guy and Jane, were reportedly hospitalized hours after their sons were killed by an alleged drunk driver.\nThe Athletic published new details about how the Gaudreau family reportedly reacted after NHL star Johnny and his brother, Matthew, were killed while cycling near Oldmans Township, New Jersey, in August 2024. (Johnny and Matthew were 31 and 29, respectively.)\nAccording to the outlet, Jane and Guy were both hospitalized on the same day that their sons were killed. Guy was put under observation for elevated blood pressure and heart rate, whereas Jane\u2019s family said she became completely unresponsive while entering a \u201ccatatonic-like state\u201d after learning of the tragedy.\nAlthough the two were put in separate hospital rooms, the nursing staff reportedly allowed Jane to crawl into Guy\u2019s bed. Both were released from the hospital after staying for two nights.\nJohnny and Matthew were back in their hometown in advance of their their sister Katie\u2019s wedding, which was postponed following their deaths. Katie and her fianc\u00e9, Devin Joyce, ultimately tied the knot in July in a Gloucester City, New Jersey, ceremony filled with tributes to her brothers.\nThe brothers\u2019 wives, Meredith and Madeline Gaudreau, were both pregnant at the time of the fatal drunk driving accident. Madeline gave birth to her first baby, Tripp Matthew, in December 2024, while Meredith welcomed son Carter Michael in April. (Johnny and Meredith shared two older children as well: Noa, born in 2022, and Johnny Jr., born in 2024.)\nIn June, Meredith wrote an open letter for Players\u2019 Tribune to describe the intense grief that both she and Madeline faced in the immediate aftermath of their husbands\u2019 deaths.\n\u201cI was in shock [when I found out]. I was keeled over for days sick to my stomach,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s completely indescribable. The only person who can relate to me is my own sister-in-law. I see her and my heart breaks for her.\u201d\nMeredith described the whiplash of emotions as she went from preparing for sister-in-law\u2019s wedding to planning her husband and brother-in-law\u2019s funerals within hours.\n\u201cTo go from getting ready for a beautiful wedding all week with your sister, to being in a funeral home with Madeline trying to figure all these things out \u2014 it just hurt so much,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt was weird and it was awful. I had to go to the doctor for our third baby. The first of my appointments where [John wasn\u2019t] holding my hand.\u201d\nHer letter went on, \u201cI looked at Noa and baby Johnny and I felt a pain that I hadn\u2019t felt before. Our two babies who have to grow up without their dad, without their amazing uncle.\u201d\nMeredith and Madeline formally announced the John and Matthew Gaudreau Foundation on August 13 \u2014 which would have been Johnny\u2019s 32nd birthday \u2014 to raise money and provide support for the hockey community, as well as charitable causes that Johnny and Matthew were passionate about. (Johnny was a seven-time NHL All-Star for the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets in his professional career, while Matthew retired from the ECHL, formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League, and the American Hockey League to coach youth hockey.)\n\u201cJohn and Matty made a tremendous and everlasting impact on everyone who knew them,\u201d a foundation statement read. \u201cIn addition to their hockey talents, the boys were known for their kindness. The Foundation\u2019s purpose is to continue giving back to what the boys are passionate about and to ultimately continue to make a positive impact on the world in their honor.\u201d\nThe legal battle over Johnny and Matthew\u2019s deaths has continued throughout the past year. In December 2024, Sean Higgins was indicted by a grand jury on suspicion of second-degree reckless vehicular homicide, first-degree aggravated manslaughter, fourth-degree tampering with physical evidence and second-degree leaving the scene of a fatal accident.\nAhead of a September trial, Higgins entered a not guilty plea and refused to accept a plea offer that would have seen him spend 35 years behind bars. If he is convicted, Higgins could face as many as 70 years in prison."

      "text": "The Sopranos alum Jamie-Lynn Sigler first opened up about her multiple sclerosis battle in 2016, nearly 15 years after she was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease at age 20.\n\u201cI already had a big career. It was difficult to accept,\u201d Sigler said while sharing the health update during an October 2016 appearance on Fox News.\nShortly after her diagnosis, Sigler\u2019s symptoms subsided, only to resurface years later as she navigated her divorce from A.J. DiScala in 2005. (The actress later moved on with Cutter Dykstra, whom she wed in 2016. The couple share sons Beau and Jack Adam.)\nAfter quietly managing the disease for years, Sigler found it \u201creally empowering\u201d to share her truth, she told Fox News. \u201c[It] allowed me a new platform and a great sense of responsibility I feel now to the MS community,\u201d Sigler continued.\nKeep scrolling for Sigler\u2019s most candid quotes about living with MS:\n2016\nDuring an appearance on Fox News, Sigler spoke about wanting to be a source of comfort to others living with health challenges.\n\u201cI think a lot of the time when people are dealing with any chronic illness you can feel very isolated, you can feel alone, you feel like people don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be somebody that says, \u2018I get it, I feel you, I hear you, I go through what you go through, and I understand.\u2019\u201d\n2020\nDespite feeling like she has \u201cevery excuse to stay in bed and say, \u2018Poor me,\u2019\u201d Sigler noted that she lives \u201ca full life,\u201d just like many others living with MS.\n\u201cPeople with MS fall in love, have kids, have marriages, have jobs, have other problems that have nothing to do with their disease,\u201d she said during a February interview with E! News\u2019 Daily Pop. \u201cI think more than anything, I just try and represent somebody who is trying to be brave in the face of it and still live their life and choose every day to not fall victim to it.\u201d\nJanuary 2022\nSigler cleared up some misconceptions about pregnancy and MS during an interview with People.\n\u201cYou can absolutely carry and you can absolutely have a very healthy pregnancy, healthy delivery,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in fact, a lot of people feel better during pregnancy. And during my first pregnancy, that was the case.\u201d\nJune 2022\n\u201cMS is like another job of mine and you know, sometimes I\u2019m a really good employee and sometimes I\u2019m not,\u201d Sigler said during an interview with CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve lived with this disease for over 21 years and you know, sometimes some days [or] some weeks, you can get a little bitter and upset about the amount of focus that it takes just to live.\u201d\nFebruary 2023\nDuring an appearance on the \u201cBathroom Chronicles\u201d podcast, Sigler admitted that she struggles to accept her physical limitations at times.\n\u201cI feel myself, like, leveling up and moving forward as a human being, but my body [is] not following me, and it\u2019s really \u2014 that\u2019s my struggle now,\u201d she shared. \u201cYou feel like it should be aligned, and it\u2019s not. That\u2019s the struggle in my family, to be quite honest, we all feel it.\u201d\nSigler added that she hasn\u2019t given up on her goal of being more physically active someday.\n\u201cI think it would be really cool for my kids to witness miraculous healing, too, how they could take that throughout their life,\u201d she said. \u201cI have, like, my vision that I always hold on to that I try to see when I meditate or anything, and it\u2019s always just me running with them. \u2026 It\u2019s me just running in front of them in their joy and their happiness, because they talk about it all the time. It\u2019s all they want.\u201d\nSeptember 2023\nThe New York native shared insight into how her illness affects her ability to parent her children.\n\u201cI\u2019m human. Are there days where I wonder, \u2018Would I have been a little bit more patient if I wasn\u2019t struggling physically?\u2019 It makes you question everything in your life. It affects every area of your life,\u201d she exclusively told Us Weekly. \u201cBut I think that when I put my kids to bed and I see the connection that we have and I know that that\u2019s completely unaffected no matter what I physically can or can\u2019t do.\u201d\nSigler added that her two sons are opposites when it comes to how they handle her condition.\n\u201cMy oldest son is an empath. He\u2019s very sensitive. If I ever apologize [to] him that I can\u2019t do certain things or explain to him certain limitations I have, he\u2019s always like, \u2018Oh, mom, I get it, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s all right.\u2019\u201d she shared. \u201cMy little one \u2026 he is upset about it, he doesn\u2019t like it. He\u2019ll compare what I can and can\u2019t do to other moms, which is totally OK.\u201d\nOctober 2023\nDuring an interview with Forbes, Sigler said that she initially kept her MS diagnosis a secret \u201cout of fear and self-preservation.\u201d She recalled navigating her busy schedule as a series regular on The Sopranos without talking to friends or a therapist about her health challenges.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a burden. I didn\u2019t know how to ask for help,\u201d she explained. \u201cI thought, \u2018Hey world, I have this illness and I\u2019ve had it for quite some time. How are you gonna feel about me now? Industry, do you still wanna hire me? Friends, do you still wanna hang out with me?\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "Christina Applegate is opening up about an honest conversation she had with daughter Sadie amid her ongoing battle with multiple sclerosis.\n\u201cI get up [in the morning] because of [Sadie],\u201d Applegate, 53, said on the Wednesday, July 30, episode of SiriusXM\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Off Camera With Kelly Ripa\u201d podcast. \u201cShe\u2019s the reason I\u2019m still here and trying. But she did say to me and we got into a big thing the other day \u2014 and sorry, Sadie, but it has to be said \u2014 she said, \u2018I missed who you were before you got sick.\u2019\u201d\nApplegate noted that the 14-year-old\u2019s comment was a \u201cknife to [the] heart\u201d because she misses who she was before she \u201cgot sick\u201d too. (Applegate and husband Martyn LeNoble, who tied the knot in 2013, share Sadie.)\n\u201cVery much so,\u201d Applegate noted. \u201cEvery day of my life is such a loss. See, now I\u2019m gonna cry. See, this is my problem. I\u2019m either like, extremely traumatic and crying, or I\u2019m cracking myself up. So I\u2019m never in between.\u201d\nApplegate revealed in August 2021 that she had been diagnosed with MS \u2014 a disease that the National MS Society noted affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, with symptoms including numbness, tingling, pain, fatigue, memory problems, mood changes, blindness and paralysis.\n\u201cHi friends. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with MS,\u201d she wrote via X at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s been a strange journey. But I have been so supported by people that I know who also have this condition. It\u2019s been a tough road. But as we all know, the road keeps going. Unless some a**hole blocks it.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cAs one of my friends that has MS said, \u2018We wake up and take the indicated action.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I do. So now I ask for privacy. As I go through this thing. Thank you xo.\u201d\nApplegate has since been candid about her battle with the disease, sharing her everyday struggles on the \u201cMesSy\u201d podcast with Jamie-Lynn Sigler \u2014 who also was diagnosed with MS. Siger, 44 \u2014 who shares sons Beau, 11, and Jack, 6, with husband Cutter Dykstra \u2014 shared on Wednesday how her children process her health battle.\n\u201cI have two children who react to it in two very different ways,\u201d Sigler explained. \u201cMy older son, he looks at me all, \u2018You\u2019re gonna beat this thing one day, Mom.\u2019 He\u2019s like my own personal Ted Lasso. He congratulates me all the time for how hard I work. He tells me I\u2019m doing amazing. He\u2019s my cheerleader.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cMy little one hates it. He\u2019s mad that I can\u2019t run like all the other moms. He points it out all the time. \u2018Why do I walk like an old lady?\u2019 That\u2019s what he says. Or like, Why I can do this and I can\u2019t do that. And I think that\u2019s very healthy and I welcome it. And I want him to be able to express himself with me. I don\u2019t want him to feel bad because of how he feels about this, because this affects our entire family.\u201d\nSigler noted that Dykstra \u201chas to make sacrifices every day,\u201d adding that she and both her children do as well. She shared, \u201cI\u2019m the mom they chose and that\u2019s what I have to kind of remind myself all the time.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s Talk Off Camera with Kelly Ripa\u201d airs Tuesdays at 5 p.m. ET on SiriusXM\u2019s Radio Andy channel and is available to stream wherever you get your podcasts."

      "text": "Bruce Willis is living in a second home amid his battle with frontotemporal dementia, wife Emma Heming Willis revealed during Emma and Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey \u2013 A Diane Sawyer Special.\n\u201cIt was one of the hardest decisions that I\u2019ve had to make so far,\u201d Heming Willis, 47, said in the ABC special that aired on Tuesday, August 26. \u201cBut I knew, first and foremost, Bruce would want that for our daughters. You know, he would want them to be in a home that was more tailored to their needs, not his needs.\u201d\nTheir second home is a one story house where Bruce lives full-time with his care team, which is not far from the family\u2019s first home. Heming Willis, who wed Willis in 2009, said she and their daughters \u2014 Mabel, 13, and Evelyn, 11 \u2014 spend \u201ca lot\u201d of time at the second home with Willis, including visits for breakfast and dinner. (Willis also shares daughters Rumer, 37, Scout, 34, and Tallulah, 31, with ex-wife Demi Moore.)\nThe Die Hard actor\u2019s family revealed in March 2022 he was retiring from acting after he was diagnosed with aphasia. According to Mayo Clinic, aphasia is a language disorder that affects how a person communicates. It can impact their speech, the way they write and the way they understand both spoken and written language.\nNearly one year later, Willis\u2019 family confirmed his condition had progressed to frontotemporal dementia, also known as FTD. It\u2019s an umbrella term for a group of brain diseases that affect the brain\u2019s frontal and temporal lobes, which are areas that are associated with personality, behavior and language.\nWillis\u2019 family has continued to share updates of his health journey with fans, but they gave the most intimate look inside Willis\u2019 life now on the ABC special. Heming Willis opened up about when she started noticing the first signs of her husband\u2019s cognitive health decline.\n\u201cFor someone who is very talkative and very engaged, he was just a little more quiet. And when the family would get together, he would kind of just melt a little bit,\u201d Heming Willis said during a sit-down interview with ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer. \u201cIt felt a little removed, very cold, not like Bruce, who was very warm and affectionate,\u201d Heming Willis continued. \u201cTo go in the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary.\u201d\nSawyer, 79, interviewed Dr. Bruce Miller for the special. While Dr. Miller does not treat Willis, he is an expert in FTD, which Sawyer said tends to strike early, as the mean age of when patients are diagnosed is 56 years old.\n\u201cThis is really the unknown disease. People weren\u2019t aware of it really until the 1990s. The research on this really has just begun,\u201d Dr. Miller explained.\nHeming Willis told Sawyer that many patients suffering from FTD often go misdiagnosed as bipolar or suffering from a midlife crisis and depression. It wasn\u2019t until a brain scan that the Pulp Fiction actor was officially diagnosed with what Sawyer referred to as \u201cthe black belt\u201d of dementias.\nThe Make Time Wellness founder was told that there was nothing to be done about Willis\u2019s FTD diagnosis, that there was no cure and no hope.\n\u201cTo leave there with no \u2026 with nothing, just nothing, with a diagnosis I couldn\u2019t pronounce. I didn\u2019t understand what it was,\u201d Heming Willis said. \u201cI was so panicked. And I just remember hearing it and just not hearing anything else. It was like I was free-falling.\u201d\nHer experience is what inspired to share her family\u2019s journey in a new book, The Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope, and Yourself on the Caregiving Path, as a way to throw out a lifeline to loved ones and caregivers who are navigating similar journeys with FTD diagnoses."

      "text": "Christina Haack and her ex-husband Josh Hall hashed out a divorce settlement and Us Weekly has all the details.\nPer the deal, Hall walked away with a home in Tennessee, a condo in Tennessee and land in California. He will also keep furniture, a 2021 Bentley, a 1970 Chevelle, a 1982 DeLorean, a 1947 Dodge and a Hondo Motorcycle.\nHall keeps all interest in his company, will not have to pay back the $100,000 that Haack provided him during the divorce and maintain his several bank accounts.\nHaack, for her part, will keep her mansion in Newport Beach, California, multiple homes in Tennessee and her business. She will return a 2022 Bentley, but keeps two 2021 GMC Yukons, a 2021 Polaris Razor and four quads. She also maintains all of her bank accounts.\nThe deal revealed Haack paid Hall a one-time payment of $300,000. Both parties waived their right to spousal support, despite Hall requesting it in his original petition.\nIn July 2024, Hall filed for divorce from Haack after three years of marriage. In his petition, he cited \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d as the reason for the split. Hall listed the date of separation as July 8, 2024.\nThe exes got legally married in October 2021 but had an official ceremony in September 2022.\nIn his filing, Hall demanded Haack pay him monthly spousal support. The couple did not sign a prenuptial agreement before getting hitched.\nHaack scoffed at Hall\u2019s request for monthly spousal support. She claimed he diverted money from a rental property she owned, which Hall was managing, to a personal account after their split. She told the court Hall had income and didn\u2019t need support from her.\nIn September 2024, the exes agreed to a temporary deal that awarded Haack exclusive use of her Orange County, California, home.\nThe court also granted Haack an apartment in Tennessee. Hall was allowed to use a second home they had in Tennessee. He also agreed to pay back any money transferred to his personal account. Per the deal, Haack paid Hall $100,000 as an advance for legal fees or other bills.\nHall announced she reached a settlement in May 2025.\n\u201cChristina is pleased to confirm that a settlement has been reached through mediation,\u201d Haack\u2019s rep told People. \u201cShe extends her sincere appreciation to her attorney, Laura Wasser, and her team for their professional guidance and support throughout the process.\u201d\nIn January, Haack spoke about her split from Hall. She described having a gut feeling that they were going to break up when they started filming their HGTV show The Flip Off. She said her ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and his wife Heather Rae El Moussa could tell something was up.\n\u201cI\u2019d been talking to both of [her ex and his wife] about it,\u201d Haack told People. \u201cThey were aware that there were issues and it\u2019s something that we had to sidebar on in regards to how all of us were going to handle even filming with Josh because there was already some difficulty there.\u201d\nHaack was previously married to El Moussa from 2009 to 2016 and Ant Anstead from 2018 to 2021."

      "text": "Influencer Emilie Kiser is breaking her silence on the death of her 3-year-old son, Trigg.\n\u201cLoss of this magnitude feels impossible to put into words,\u201d Kiser wrote via Instagram on Thursday, August 28. \u201cI\u2019ve spent days, weeks, months trying to find them and also take the time I\u2019ve needed to digest the loss of my baby.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cTrigg is our baby and our best friend. The light and spirit he brought into this world was bright, pure, joyful and undeniable. We miss him every second of every day and continuing forward often feels unbearable. I never thought we would experience grief in this way or the pain of losing him so suddenly.\u201d\nKiser noted that \u201cno family should ever have to endure\u201d the \u201cpain, heartache and void\u201d they have experienced.\n\u201cI take full accountability as Trigg\u2019s mother, and I know I should have done more to protect him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOne of the hardest lessons I carry is that a permanent pool fence could have saved his life, and it\u2019s something I will never overlook again. I hope amidst this pain, Trigg\u2019s story will help prevent other children and families from suffering the same loss.\u201d\nKiser then thanked their family for their \u201cunconditional love\u201d and to her audience for the \u201ckind messages.\u201d\n\u201cThe only way through grief is to keep going minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day and every moment since that day I\u2019ve done my best to keep picking myself up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen I started on social media in 2021 as a new mom, my goal was to connect with other moms and find a community. I have found that and so much more through all of you. I found a community, a hobby I love and a job I am so grateful for.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cI have always been my authentic self on social media and tried my best to share my everyday life honestly, while also being mindful of what I didn\u2019t choose to share. I now have seen through this tragedy how relationships online lack boundaries, especially in protecting children\u2019s privacy. Moving forward, I will be establishing more boundaries with what I share online.\u201d\nKiser concluded her statement by sharing that she hopes to \u201cbe in a place to share more about how I am navigating this grief, but right now, all I can say is thank you for the love, compassion, patience and space you\u2019ve given us to grieve. I am grateful for it more than can ever be expressed.\u201d\nThe Chandler, Arizona, Police Department confirmed to Us Weekly on May 18 that Trigg passed away that afternoon after being pulled unconscious from the family\u2019s backyard pool on the evening of May 12. A cause of death was not shared at the time.\n\u201cThe investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident remain ongoing. This is still an open investigation,\u201d the department said in a statement to Us. \u201cOut of respect for the family\u2019s privacy, we will not be releasing additional details until the investigation is closed.\u201d Us confirmed in June that the investigation was closed.\nThe Chandler Fire Department previously told local Arizona news outlet 12 News that Trigg was in critical condition after he was discovered in the pool. Police officers reportedly arrived first on the scene and began performing CPR before firefighters took over. Trigg was subsequently flown to Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital for further treatment.\nLater that month, Kiser filed a lawsuit asking the court to block the release of records related to Trigg\u2019s death.\n\u201cEmilie is going through a parent\u2019s worst nightmare right now. She lost her young son, her three-year-old Trigg Chapman Kiser (\u2018Trigg\u2019), on May 18, 2025, following a heartbreaking accidental drowning at the family\u2019s home on May 12, 2025,\u201d the lawsuit published by Arizona Republic read. \u201cEmilie is trying her best to be there for her surviving son, two-month-old Theodore. But every day is a battle.\u201d\nIn court documents obtained by Us in June, a judge ruled to give Emilie temporary confidentiality on her request for privacy \u201cuntil a determination is made that balances the public\u2019s need for information vs privacy interests.\u201d\nSources close to the litigation shared with Us that Kiser was not home at the time of the accident and \u201cshould not be forced to relive the aftermath through viral footage.\u201d Brady, meanwhile, told authorities that he was home alone with their two sons. Per search warrant applications obtained by USA Today in June, Brady said he was \u201csoon distracted\u201d by their youngest son when he lost sight of Trigg for three to five minutes. When he saw Trigg in the pool, Brady jumped in and called 911. Us reached out to Brady\u2019s team for comment at the time.\nIn July, the Chandler Police Department submitted a criminal charge recommendation for Brady. \u201cThe Chandler Police Department has completed its investigation into the tragic drowning of three-year-old Trigg Kiser. Following a thorough review of the evidence, investigators have recommended a Class 4 felony charge of child abuse against Brady Kiser,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe case has now been submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office for review.\u201d Us reached out to Brady\u2019s team for comment at the time.\nA statement later released by the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office shared that there is \u201cno likelihood of conviction\u201d against Brady.\nEmilie and Brady, who wed in 2020, became parents with the birth of Trigg in July 2021. \u201cTrigg Chapman Kiser II born 07-14-21 at 9:04 pm 6 pounds 5 ounces,\u201d she captioned hospital pics of her then-newborn via Instagram. \u201cWe are smitten with all his tiny features and love him so much\ud83e\udd0e.\u201d\nTheir family grew with the birth of the couple\u2019s second son, Teddy earlier this year. \u201cThere\u2019s no words to describe finally meeting Teddy and finally getting to analyze every part of him and how perfect he is\ud83e\uddf8,\u201d Emilie wrote alongside a March 27 Instagram video of Teddy\u2019s delivery. \u201cThe long wait was beyond worth it. I\u2019d do it all over again solely for the moment of Brady holding up our baby and announcing him to me\ud83e\udd0e.\u201d\nEmilie\u2019s videos about marriage and motherhood have gained her over 1.2 million Instagram followers and over 3.4 million TikTok followers. She included several snaps of Trigg in her most recent Instagram post, which she captioned, \u201cLove a good dump of photos and a good hair day\ud83c\udf53\u2601\ufe0f\u2728\u2665\ufe0f.\u201d\nPosted the day after Mother\u2019s Day, the May 12 slideshow featured a heartwarming photo of Trigg kissing his mother on the cheek as she held baby Teddy, as well as pics of Brady laying in bed with his sons and Trigg seemingly drying in a towel after a swim in the pool.\nFor more vital, lifesaving information on pool safety, see Bode Miller\u2019s tips and visit Coverstar\u2019s website during Water Safety Awareness Month."
