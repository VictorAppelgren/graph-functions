      "title": "Bryan Kohberger’s phone records show his creepy loner lifestyle: ‘It’s Bates Motel … just super eerie’",
      "summary": "Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, admitted to murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022 and avoided the death penalty through a plea deal, sparking outrage from victims’ families. Digital forensics revealed his phone contained disturbing porn searches, creepy selfies, and obsessive calls to his parents, painting a picture of a disturbed loner who tried to cover his tracks but left key evidence. Prosecutors highlighted several investigative blunders—such as leaving DNA on a knife sheath, buying a weapon on Amazon, and cleaning his car too thoroughly—that ultimately linked him to the crime scene. After his conviction, Kohberger was transferred to Idaho’s maximum‑security prison, where inmates reportedly harass him through vents, while the state emphasizes that such behavior is a normal form of prisoner communication.
