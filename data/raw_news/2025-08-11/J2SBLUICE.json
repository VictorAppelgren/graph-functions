  "content": "Taylor Swift is in her showgirl era.\n\nThe pop superstar just announced her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl \u2014 and if you want to know more, you're gonna have to stay tuned to the New Heights podcast on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET. Swift made the big announcement on her social media accounts at exactly 12:12 a.m. on August 12, naturally.\n\nIn the announcement, a clip from the podcast, which is hosted by her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason, shows Swift revealing the cover for the album \u2014 which is conveniently blurred out \u2014 as the brothers freak out. It was revealed earlier in the day that Swift would be on the latest episode of the podcast, which is set to drop Wednesday.\n\n\"Posted at 12:12 on the 12th. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 Tay\u2019s 12th album is called\u2026\u2026\u2026pre pre-order now at TaylorSwift.com,\" the caption of the post reads.\n\nA countdown on her official website beforehand now leads to preorder pages for a vinyl, a CD with a poster, and a cassette, and a note on each page tells fans the items ship \"before Oct. 13\" \u2014 but, the real release date will be revealed at a later date.\n\nThe Life of a Showgirl marks the first new record for Swift since she revealed in May 2025 that she'd successfully bought back the full rights and masters to her first six albums, therefore making her the owner of her entire discography.\n\nIt's also the first since her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, released in April 2024, and since her massive, world-spanning Eras Tour ended in December of that year.\n\nSince the tour ended, Swifties everywhere have done what they do best \u2014 looking into every caption, every outfit, and every word out of the Grammy winner's mouth to glean some clues about what could be coming next. To that end, when Swift announced the masters deal, a letter on her website explaining the news used 12 of the letter \"i\" in one line that read, \"All the times I was thiiiiiiiiiiiis close.\"\n\nAnd, in an Instagram Stories caption celebrating friend Selena Gomez's album I Said I Love You First, Swift similarly used 12 of the letter \"d,\" writing, \"OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDD.\" All of this led Swifties to believe a 12th studio album was imminent.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nSpeculation kicked into overdrive on Monday when the Swift-affiliated social media account Taylor Nation shared an Instagram post with 12 photos, using the caption, \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era\u2026' \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 .\"\n\nAround the same time, the New Heights Instagram account shared news of an unexpected special episode with a \"a VERY special guest\" set for Aug. 13 (13, of course, being Swift's favorite number). The picture included in the post featured a very Swiftian outline of said guest, and both Kelce brothers appeared to be wearing Swift merch in the snap. Later in the day, Swift's official website updated its style with a countdown for 12:12 a.m. In other words, those were all the invisible strings pointing us to the new era.",

Seemingly to celebrate the announcement, Spotify billboards seen in Nashville and New York on Monday night pointed fans to a playlist by Swift titled \"And, baby, that's show business for you.\" This is notable for two reasons \u2014 that title could refer to lyrics on the new album, and the songs on the playlist all were produced or co-produced by Max Martin and Shellback, the duo who previously worked on Swift's Red, 1989, and Reputation albums, possibly hinting at Showgirl's sound.

By Nick Romano Nick Romano Nick is an entertainment journalist based in New York, NY. If you like pugs and the occasional blurry photo of an action figure, follow him on Twitter @NickARomano. EW's editorial guidelines Updated on May 30, 2025 12:18PM EDT Leave a Comment Taylor Swift at the 67th Grammy Awards. Credit: Gilbert Flores/Billboard After years of drama surrounding the ownership of Taylor Swift's music catalog, the Midnights and Tortured Poets Department superstar made a surprise announcement to her fans who have been closely tracking the turmoil. In a stunning business move, Swift bought back her first six albums. Posting a photo of herself surrounded by the vinyl editions of these titles, she wrote, \"You belong with me.\" She then published a lengthy letter to her official website in which she stated, \"All the music I've ever made...now belongs...to me.\" \"To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,\" Swift writes in the letter. \"To my fans, you know how important this has been to me \u2014 so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released 4 of my albums, calling them Taylor's Version. the passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour into is why I was able to buy back my music. I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.\" She continued, \"All I've ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy. I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. the way they've handled every interaction we've had has been honest, fair, and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: My memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.\" Taylor Swift no longer subpoenaed in Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni legal battle 'The Handmaid's Tale' showrunners on why [SPOILER] had to die and getting that Taylor Swift song But, wait! What about the Taylor's Version of Reputation? Swift released her re-recording of the revenge track to that album, \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" as part of the final season of The Handmaid's Tale. Is the rest of it now finished? Swift has an answer for that, too. \"Full transparency: I haven't even re-recorded a quarter of it,\" she writes. \"The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it. All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off.\" She confirms, \"There will be a time (if you're into the idea) for the unreleased vault tracks from that album to hatch. I've already completely re-recorded my entire debut album, and I really love how it sounds now. Those 2 albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.\" It's been a tremendously long journey for Swift. The rights to her discography were first sold against her will by Big Machine Records in 2019, which then prompted her to issue re-recordings of those albums. But she never lost sight of her main goal, which was to reclaim ownership of her own work. Her announcement today confirms she purchased her earlier albums from the current rights holders at Shamrock Capital for an undisclosed sum. Variety reports it's upwards of nine figures. The New York Post, when first signaling the news last week, cited an amount between $600 million to $1 billion, though there are conflicting reports.

The Post also reported that Scooter Braun, who became a controversial figure over his purchase of Swift's masters, encouraged the sale of the music library back to the musician. \"There\u2019s documented proof, by way of verified emails, confirming Taylor Swift was offered the opportunity to buy back her masters prior to Shamrock Capital\u2019s acquisition,\" a source, who prefers to remain anonymous, tells Entertainment Weekly. \"This has been reported on at length over the last several years. The 2024 Hulu documentary showcases both sides of this story, and even includes emails from Scooter offering the sale of her masters.\" However, another source close to the contract negotiations tells Entertainment Weekly that is not the case. \"Contrary to a previous false report, there was no outside party who \u2018encouraged\u2019 this sale,\" the source says. \"All rightful credit for this opportunity should go to the partners at Shamrock Capital and Taylor\u2019s Nashville-based management team only. Taylor now owns all of her music, and this moment finally happened in spite of Scooter Braun, not because of him.\" EW reached out to representatives for Swift for comment. A rep for Braun passed along this quote from him: \"I am happy for her.\" \"I'm extremely heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry among artists and fans,\" Swift concludes her letter. \"Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in the record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted, and ended us up here. Thanks to you and your goodwill, teamwork, and encouragement, the best things that have ever been mine...finally actually are.\" Read Swift's full letter on her website.
