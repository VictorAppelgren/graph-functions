  "content": "This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology. Synthesia\u2019s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they\u2019ll be able to talk back.\n\nEarlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to give it what it needed to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company\u2019s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.\n\n\n\nI found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It\u2019s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn\u2019t know me, you\u2019d probably think that\u2019s exactly what it was. My avatar shows how it\u2019s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story. How Trump is helping China extend its massive lead in clean energy On a spring day in 1954, Bell Labs researchers showed off the first practical solar panels at a press conference in New Jersey, using sunlight to spin a toy Ferris wheel before a stunned crowd. The solar future looked bright. But in the race to commercialize the technology it invented, the US would lose resoundingly. Last year, China exported $40 billion worth of solar panels and modules, while America shipped just $69 million, according to the New York Times. It was a stunning forfeit of a huge technological lead. Now, thanks to its policies propping up aging fossil-fuel industries, the US seems determined to repeat the mistake. Read the full story.\n\nThis article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review\u2019s newsletter all about the latest in climate and energy tech.

      "text": "Atlas, the humanoid robot famous for its parkour and dance routines, has recently begun demonstrating something altogether more subtle but also a lot more significant: It has learned to both walk and grab things using a single artificial intelligence model.\nWhat is more, the robot\u2019s single learning model is showing some tantalizingly \u201cemergent\u201d skills, like the ability to instinctively recover when it drops an item without having been trained to do so.\nBoston Dynamics, the company that makes Atlas, together with the Toyota Research Institute (TRI), developed a generalist model that learns to control both arms and legs from a range of example actions. This is different from the norm: robots equipped with the ability to learn would usually rely on one model to walk and jump and another to grasp items.\n\u201cThe feet are just like additional hands, in some sense, to the model,\u201d says Russ Tedrake, a roboticist at the Toyota Research Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who led the current work. \u201cAnd it works, which is just awesome.\u201d\nThe single model used to control Atlas is fed images from the robot\u2019s visual sensors, proprioception data from bodily sensors (which give it a continuous sense of its position and movement), and language prompts related to different actions. The model is shown examples of Atlas performing a range of tasks using a mix of teleoperation, simulation, and demonstration videos. The resulting large behavior model (LBM) controls the humanoid robot in a more natural-seeming way. When picking items out of a bin, for example, the robot will reposition its legs much like a person to rebalance when reaching low down. The LBM also exhibits some basic emergent behavior. When the robot drops an item, for instance, it demonstrates a new \u201crecovery\u201d skill by bending down to pick it up.\nThis is a lot more exciting than it might seem. Just as large language models (LLMs) fed by huge amounts of text data sometimes exhibit unexpected abilities, like the ability to code, roboticists hope that a similar strategy will produce robots that exhibit a lot of surprising new skills when trying to get things done.\nTedrake says that Atlas and other robots are starting to show signs of more generalized learning. His lab is also experimenting with different kinds of robot arms that are trained to perform various tasks, including slicing vegetables and sweeping up spilled coffee beans.\nWhile there is a lot of work to do, Tedrake says all of the evidence so far suggests that the approaches used to LLMs also work for robots. \u201cI think it's changing everything,\u201d he says.\nGauging progress in robotics has become more challenging of late, of course, with videoclips showing commercial humanoids performing complex chores, like loading refrigerators or taking out the trash with seeming ease. YouTube clips can be deceptive, though, and humanoid robots tend to be either teleoperated, carefully programmed in advance, or trained to do a single task in very controlled conditions.\nThe new Atlas work is a big sign that robots are starting to experience the kind of equivalent advances in robotics that eventually led to the general language models that gave us ChatGPT in the field of generative AI. Eventually, such progress could give us robots that are able to operate in a wide range of messy environments with ease and are able to rapidly learn new skills\u2014from welding pipes to making espressos\u2014without extensive retraining.\n\u201cIt's definitely a step forward,\u201d says Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at UC Berkeley who receives some funding from TRI but was not involved with the Atlas work. \u201cThe coordination of legs and arms is a big deal.\u201d\nGoldberg says, however, that the idea of emergent robot behavior should be treated carefully. Just as the surprising abilities of large language models can sometimes be traced to examples included in their training data, he says that robots may demonstrate skills that seem more novel than they really are. He adds that it is helpful to know details about how often a robot succeeds and in what ways it fails during experiments. TRI has previously been transparent with the work it\u2019s done on LBMs and may well release more data on the new model.\nWhether simple scaling up the data used to train robot models will unlock ever-more emergent behavior remains an open question. At a debate held in May at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Atlanta, Goldberg and others cautioned that engineering methods will also play an important role going forward.\nTedrake, for one, is convinced that robotics is nearing an inflection point\u2014one that will enable more real-world use of humanoids and other robots. \u201cI think we need to put these robots out of the world and start doing real work,\u201d he says.\nWhat do you think of Atlas\u2019 new skills? And do you think that we are headed for a ChatGPT-style breakthrough in robotics? Let me know your thoughts on ailab@wired.com.\nThis is an edition of Will Knight\u2019s AI Lab newsletter.

She specializes in writing about farmhouse decor, small space organizing, and urban living. Ashley is also the co-founder of The Lazy Travelers blog. Learn more about The Spruce's Editorial Process Published on 08/27/25 Close Credit: Andreas von Einsiedel / Getty Images Key Points Bland art, no lighting plan, and poorly sized furniture make homes feel impersonal or awkward.These mistakes often lead to costly do-overs and spaces that feel chaotic or outdated.Choosing quality pieces and decorating with intention creates a home that feels stylish and personal. One of the biggest home decor headaches is when you tackle a project or chase a trend only to find that it doesn't look as good in practice. This is even more annoying when it costs time and money to do\u2014and will cost even more time and money to fix. Luckily, these decor faux pas can be avoided. We turned to a few of our favorite pros to find the biggest offenders, so we know exactly what to avoid and replace. Meet the Expert Susie Novak is an interior designer and the founder of Susie Novak Interiors. Brittany Cooper is the owner and principal designer of Rathell Designs. John Stivale is an interior designer and co-founder of Stivale Graffam Home. Bland Art and Dated Accessories To create an intentional, well-curated space, designer Susie Novak says decorating your home with art and accessories you love is important. Otherwise, you run the risk of creating a sterile space that lacks personality. \u201cArt and accessories can seem basic, but they are the element in the home that truly tells your story about your travels, your personality,\u201d Novak says. This is the best way to avoid a sterile space that feels more like a hotel than a home. Want more design inspiration? Sign up for our free daily newsletter for the latest decor ideas, designer tips, and more! No Lighting Plan Johner Images / Getty Images. As designer Brittany Cooper notes, every great home has great lighting. \u201cGood lighting transforms a space by enhancing its functionality and aesthetic appeal,\u201d Cooper says. Wwithout it, your home can look poorly thought out. To avoid this, Cooper suggests elegant fixtures and intentional recessed lights, combined with smart lighting systems\u2014or at least one of these three options to start. Don't Miss 7 Big Updates I'm Making to My Rental to Make It Feel Like Home \u2014 And You Should Too 6 \u201cVintage-Inspired\u201d Trends That Just Look Dated, According to Designers Thoughtlessly Following the Trends It\u2019s one thing to fall in love with a new trend and want to incorporate it into your space. It\u2019s quite another to buy low-quality, mass-produced items simply to make your home fit into a box. \u201cStay away from trendy pieces that quickly go out of style and can make a space feel less cohesive and more transient,\u201d says designer John Stivale. Maximalism Gone Wrong Credit: Andreas von Einsiedel / Getty Images Overdoing it with the accessories can be a major faux pas, and a cluttered home can often feel chaotic. Instead of picking decor based on price or recognition, try to collect fewer, more meaningful pieces. Take into consideration your style and existing design theme so that you can enhance your space without overdoing it. Bad Cabinetry While quality cabinetry can be a big expense, Novak says it\u2019s too important of an element to ignore. Poor cabinetry can also end up costing you more to fix it later. \u201cNot all cabinetry is created equal, and investing in good cabinets will last you years and years,\u201d Novak says. \u201cIt will also add to a nice, everyday user experience.\u201d Out-of-Proportion Furniture FollowTheFlow / Getty Images. Furniture can be a big expense, but the best thing you can focus on is buying pieces that are the right proportions for your room. \u201cProperly scaled furniture ensures that a room feels balanced, comfortable, and thoughtfully designed, avoiding the common regret of having to replace or rearrange pieces later on,\u201d Cooper says. If you go too big, you can overwhelm the room and create a cramped space. But skewing small can make your home feel awkward and uncomfortable. Instead, always make time to measure. Textured Walls Textured walls are a surefire way to date your home, says Novak. Rather than live with a funny finish, she suggests investing in smoothing them out. Without it, walls can have a knock-on effect that infiltrates the rest of your room. \u201cIf your walls are not the right texture, the paint, art, and all the other decor just does not look right,\u201d Novak says. \u201cIt's a big investment but worth it.\u201d Explore more: Home Design & Decorating Decorating Design Tips"

      "text": "The Caribbean island of Anguilla has found its new AI cash cow. When the internet first started out, countries and territories claimed their unique domain extensions to tag onto websites \u2014 .us, .uk, and for Anguilla, .ai. With the AI boom that came decades later, companies and entrepreneurs are paying the British Overseas Territory top dollar to register their websites with its domain, the BBC reported. The same thing happened for the Pacific island of Tuvalu and its domain .tv more than two decades ago.\nLast year, Anguilla generated $39 million selling its domain, almost a quarter of the island\u2019s total revenue. With only 16,000 people, it expects to make $48.8 million this year and $51 million in 2026 from the service.\nThere are nearly 880,000 registered domains ending in .ai, a number that almost doubled in a year, according to a domain registration tracker. The business may allow Anguilla to diversify its economy, which is largely reliant on tourism dollars at risk each hurricane season."

      "text": "I\u2019ve been teaching robotics at the University of Washington for more than a decade. Every class begins with \u201crobotics news of the week.\u201d For years, humanoid robots appeared only occasionally\u2014usually in the form of viral clips of the Boston Dynamics Atlas doing parkour or RoboCup humanoid league bloopers that served more as comic relief than serious news.\nBut over the past few years, things have shifted. Each week brings another humanoid demo, each flashier than the last, as companies race to showcase new capabilities. And behind those slick videos lies a flood of venture capital. Humanoid robotics has become a billion-dollar frenzy.\nThe scale of investment is astonishing. Just a year ago, Figure AI\u2019s $2.6 billion valuation seemed extraordinary\u2014until its latest funding round catapulted it to $39.5 billion. Investors large and small are rushing in, and tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and NVIDIA are scrambling to get a foothold for fear of missing out. Tesla is pouring resources into its Optimus robot, while China has committed more than $10 billion in government funding to drive down costs and seize market dominance. Goldman Sachs now projects the global humanoid market could reach $38 billion by 2035.\nThis surge of interest reflects a long-standing dream in robotics: if machines could match human form and function, they could simply step into human jobs without requiring us to change our environments. If humanoids could do everything people can, then in theory they could replace workers on the factory floor or in warehouse aisles. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that many humanoid companies are targeting what they believe are sectors with labor shortages and undesirable jobs\u2014manufacturing, logistics, distribution, retail\u2014as near-term markets.\nFactories first, homes next?\nA subset of humanoid companies see homes as the next frontier. Figure AI claims humanoids will revolutionize \u201cassisting individuals in the home\u201d and \u201ccaring for the elderly.\u201d Its marketing materials show robots handing an apple to a human, making coffee, putting away groceries and dishes, pouring drinks, and watering plants. Tesla\u2019s Optimus similarly branded as an \u201cautonomous assistant, humanoid friend,\u201d is shown folding clothes, cracking eggs, unloading groceries, receiving packages, and even playing family games. The Neo humanoid by 1X Technologies appears targeted solely at in-home use, with the company declaring that \u201c1X bets on the home\u201d and is \u201cbuilding a world where we do more of what we love, while our humanoid companions handle the rest.\u201d Neo is depicted vacuuming, serving tea, wiping windows and tables, and carrying laundry and grocery bags.\nAll these glossy marketing videos struck a personal chord with me. I have always dreamed of robots in homes\u2014and I know I am not alone. Like many roboticists of my generation, my earliest memories of robots trace back to Rosie the Robot from The Jetsons. I dedicated my career to getting assistive robots into homes. In 2014, my students and I placed a PR2 robot in a home in Arizona, where it failed miserably at most tasks\u2014though we learned a great deal in the process. Later, I was part of more successful in-home deployments of a Stretch robot and an assistive feeding robot. I even found myself enjoying housework because it gave me a chance to analyze the tasks it entailed with an eye toward someday automating them. For years, I promoted my work under a personal motto: \u201cI want robots to do all the chores by the time I retire,\u201d often joking that I might never retire.\nYet when billion-dollar companies began chasing the same dream, I found myself reacting with unease. I had always imagined that home robots would be more like Rosie\u2014robotic and cartoonish\u2014and my own research moved further and further away from the human form because non-humanoid robots were more practical and preferred by users. I struggled to picture a humanoid in my own house\u2013-or any of the homes where I had deployed robots in. And after years of human-centered research in robotics, I could not imagine users welcoming humanoids into their homes without hesitation. Still, I assumed someone must want them. Surely some fraction of those billions had gone into market research and customer insight. And I wanted to know what they knew.\n(Left) Three real-world humanoids shown to participants in our study (Figure, Optimus, Neo). (Right) Examples of three general-purpose robots with few or no human-like features (PR2, Fetch, Stretch).Maya Cakmak\nWhat people actually think\nTo find out, my students and I set out to better understand what the public thinks about humanoid robots in the home. We surveyed 76 participants from the U.S. and the U.K., asking whether they considered humanoids in the home acceptable, which designs they preferred, and why. We also presented them with imagined scenarios where either a humanoid or a special-purpose robot assisted an older adult with tasks like eating, dressing, or vacuuming, and asked which they would choose. The results are detailed in our paper \u201cAttitudes Towards Humanoid Robots for In-Home Assistance,\u201d presented this week at the IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN).\nOur survey showed that people generally prefer special purpose robots over humanoids. They see special-purpose robots as safer, more private, and ultimately more comfortable to have in their homes and around loved ones. So, while humanoid companies (and their investors) dream of a single humanoid capable of doing it all, our survey participants seem to be more on board with a toolbox of smaller, specialized machines for most tasks: a Roomba for cleaning, a medication dispenser for pills, a stairlift for stairs.\nNevertheless, most survey participants considered humanoids in the home acceptable. Some even preferred humanoids for certain tasks, especially when the special-purpose alternative was more speculative\u2014like a dressing assistant robot. When shown images of Neo, Figure 02, and Optimus performing household tasks, they agreed the robots looked useful and well-suited for homes. Many said they would feel comfortable having one in their own home\u2014or in the home of a loved one. Of course, we had framed the scenarios optimistically: participants were told to assume the robots had passed extensive safety testing, were approved by regulators, and would be covered by insurance\u2014assumptions that may be decades away from reality. And we can safely assume that finding humanoids \u201cacceptable\u201d doesn\u2019t mean people actually want them\u2014or that they\u2019d be willing to pay for one.\nAI-generated images of humanoid and special purpose robots across eight tasks used in our questionnaires.Cakmak et al, 2025\nAre home humanoids safe?\nUnsurprisingly the task context impacted whether people were open to humanoids in the home. Participants balked at imaginary scenarios involving safety-critical assistance\u2014such as being carried down a staircase\u2014responding with visceral rejections like \u201cabsolutely not in a million years.\u201d Whereas for tasks that require little interaction\u2014such as folding laundry\u2014most were willing to imagine a humanoid lending a hand.\nEven with our reassurances about safety, people readily imagined hazards: humanoids could trip, stumble, or tip over; they might glitch, run out of battery, or malfunction. The idea of a robot handling hot surfaces or sharp objects were also mentioned by multiple participants as serious concerns.\nPrivacy was another major concern. Participants worried about camera data being sent to the cloud or robots being remotely controlled by strangers. Several pointed out the security risks\u2014any internet-connected device, they noted, could be hacked.\nEven participants who saw clear benefits often described a lingering unease. Several described the robots as \u201ccreepy\u201d or \u201cunsettling,\u201d and a few explicitly mentioned the uncanny valley effect, pointing in particular to the black face masks common on this new generation of humanoids. One participant described the masks as creating an \u201ceerie sensation, the idea that something might be watching you.\u201d I felt a similar conflict watching a video of Neo (1X) sitting on a couch after finishing its chores\u2014a scene that was meant to be comforting but instead left me unsettled.\nA common reason participants preferred special-purpose robots was space. Humanoids were described as \u201cbulky\u201d and \u201cunnecessary,\u201d while specialized robots were seen as \u201cless intrusive\u201d and \u201cmore discreet.\u201d These comments reminded me of user research conducted in Japan by the Toyota Research Institute, which led to a ceiling-mounted robot design after finding that limited floor space was a major barrier to adoption. The same thought struck me at home when I showed an in-home humanoid video to my nine-year-old and asked if we should get one. He replied: \u201cBut we don\u2019t have an extra bed.\u201d His answer nailed the point: if your home doesn\u2019t have room for another human, it probably doesn\u2019t have room for a humanoid.\nVery big ifs\nIn the end, the study didn\u2019t fully answer my question about what these companies know that I don\u2019t. Participants said they would accept humanoids\u2014if they were safe, worked reliably, and didn\u2019t cost more than the alternatives. Those are very big ifs.\nAnd of course, our study asked people to use their imaginations. Looking at a picture is not the same as sharing your living room with a six-foot metal figure that moves\u2014in reality, their reactions might be very different. Likewise, picturing yourself someday needing help with eating, dressing, or walking is very different from already relying on that help every day. Perhaps for those already living with these needs, the immediacy of their situation would make the promise of humanoids more compelling.\nTo probe further, I asked the same question to a panel of six people with motor limitations who are experienced users of assistive robots at the HRI 2025 Physical Caregiving Robots Workshop. Not one of them wanted a humanoid. Their concerns ranged from \u201cit\u2019s creepy\u201d to \u201cit has to be 100 percent safe because I cannot escape it.\u201d One panelist summed it up perfectly: \u201cTrying to make assistive robots with humanoids would be like trying to make autonomous cars by putting humanoids in the driver\u2019s seat and asking them to drive like a human.\u201d After all, it was obvious to investors that the better path to autonomous vehicles was to modify or redesign vehicles for autonomy, rather than replicate human drivers. So why are they convinced that replicating humans is the right solution for the home?\nWhat\u2019s the alternative?\nSpecial-purpose robots may be preferable to humanoids, but building a dedicated machine for every possible task is unrealistic. Homes involve a long tail of chores, and general-purpose robots could indeed provide enormous value. However, the humanoid form is likely overkill, since much simpler designs\u2014such as wheeled robots with basic pinch grippers\u2014can already accomplish a great deal and are far more attainable. And people will likely accept modest changes to their homes to expand what these robots can do, just as Roomba owners move furniture to let their vacuums work. After all, our homes have already transformed around new technologies\u2014cars, appliances, televisions\u2014so why not for robots, if they prove just as valuable?\nBut beyond the unnecessary complexity, a more important issue about the humanoid form may be that users find it less desirable than simpler alternatives. Research has long shown that highly human-like robots can trigger negative emotional responses, and our study suggests that is true of the latest generation of humanoids. Simpler designs with more cartoon-like features are more likely to be accepted as companions. We may even want home robots with no human-like features at all, so they can be viewed as tools rather than social agents. I believe those who would benefit most from in-home robots\u2014including the rapidly growing population of older adults\u2014would prefer robots that empower them to do things for themselves, rather than ones that attempt to replace human caregivers. Yet humanoid companies are openly pursuing the latter.\nOnly time will tell whether humanoid companies can deliver on their promises\u2014and whether people, myself included, will welcome them into their homes. I hope our findings encourage these companies to dig deeper and share their insights about in-home humanoid customers. I\u2019d also like to see more capital directed toward alternative robot designs for the home. In the meantime, my students and I can\u2019t wait to get our hands on one of these humanoids\u2014purely in the name of science\u2014bring it to older adults in our communities, and hear their unfiltered reactions. I can already imagine someone saying, \u201cIt better not sit in my recliner when I\u2019m not looking,\u201d or, \u201cIf it\u2019s going to live here, it better pay rent.\u201d\n- Study: Nobody Wants Social Robots That Look Like Humans Because They Threaten Our Identity \u203a\n- Where\u2019s My Robot? \u203a\n- Humanoid Robots Are Getting to Work \u203a\nMaya Cakmak is a professor at the Paul G.

      "text": "Inside India\u2019s scramble for AI independence\nStructural challenges and the nation\u2019s many languages have made it tough to develop foundational AI models. But the government is keen not to be left behind.\nIn Bengaluru, India, Adithya Kolavi felt a mix of excitement and validation as he watched DeepSeek unleash its disruptive language model on the world earlier this year. The Chinese technology rivaled the best of the West in terms of benchmarks, but it had been built with far less capital in far less time.\n\u201cI thought: \u2018This is how we disrupt with less,\u2019\u201d says Kolavi, the 20-year-old founder of the Indian AI startup CognitiveLab. \u201cIf DeepSeek could do it, why not us?\u201d\nBut for Abhishek Upperwal, founder of Soket AI Labs and architect of one of India\u2019s earliest efforts to develop a foundation model, the moment felt more bittersweet.\nUpperwal\u2019s model, called Pragna-1B, had struggled to stay afloat with tiny grants while he watched global peers raise millions. The multilingual model had a relatively modest 1.25 billion parameters and was designed to reduce the \u201clanguage tax,\u201d the extra costs that arise because India\u2014unlike the US or even China\u2014has a multitude of languages to support. His team had trained it, but limited resources meant it couldn\u2019t scale. As a result, he says, the project became a proof of concept rather than a product.\n\u201cIf we had been funded two years ago, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019d be the ones building what DeepSeek just released,\u201d he says.\nKolavi\u2019s enthusiasm and Upperwal\u2019s dismay reflect the spectrum of emotions among India\u2019s AI builders. Despite its status as a global tech hub, the country lags far behind the likes of the US and China when it comes to homegrown AI. That gap has opened largely because India has chronically underinvested in R&D, institutions, and invention. Meanwhile, since no one native language is spoken by the majority of the population, training language models is far more complicated than it is elsewhere.\nHistorically known as the global back office for the software industry, India has a tech ecosystem that evolved with a services-first mindset. Giants like Infosys and TCS built their success on efficient software delivery, but invention was neither prioritized nor rewarded. Meanwhile, India\u2019s R&D spending hovered at just 0.65% of GDP ($25.4 billion) in 2024, far behind China\u2019s 2.68% ($476.2 billion) and the US\u2019s 3.5% ($962.3 billion). The muscle to invent and commercialize deep tech, from algorithms to chips, was just never built.\nIsolated pockets of world-class research do exist within government agencies like the DRDO (Defense Research & Development Organization) and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization), but their breakthroughs rarely spill into civilian or commercial use. India lacks the bridges to connect risk-taking research to commercial pathways, the way DARPA does in the US. Meanwhile, much of India\u2019s top talent migrates abroad, drawn to ecosystems that better understand and, crucially, fund deep tech.\nSo when the open-source foundation model DeepSeek-R1 suddenly outperformed many global peers, it struck a nerve. This launch by a Chinese startup prompted Indian policymakers to confront just how far behind the country was in AI infrastructure, and how urgently it needed to respond.\nIndia responds\nIn January 2025, 10 days after DeepSeek-R1\u2019s launch, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) solicited proposals for India\u2019s own foundation models, which are large AI models that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks. Its public tender invited private-sector cloud and data\u2011center companies to reserve GPU compute capacity for government\u2011led AI research.\nProviders including Jio, Yotta, E2E Networks, Tata, AWS partners, and CDAC responded. Through this arrangement, MeitY suddenly had access to nearly 19,000 GPUs at subsidized rates, repurposed from private infrastructure and allocated specifically to foundational AI projects. This triggered a surge of proposals from companies wanting to build their own models.\nWithin two weeks, it had 67 proposals in hand. That number tripled by mid-March.\nIn April, the government announced plans to develop six large-scale models by the end of 2025, plus 18 additional AI applications targeting sectors like agriculture, education, and climate action. Most notably, it tapped Sarvam AI to build a 70-billion-parameter model optimized for Indian languages and needs.\nFor a nation long restricted by limited research infrastructure, things moved at record speed, marking a rare convergence of ambition, talent, and political will.\n\u201cIndia could do a Mangalyaan in AI,\u201d said Gautam Shroff of IIIT-Delhi, referencing the country\u2019s cost-effective, and successful, Mars orbiter mission.\nJaspreet Bindra, cofounder of AI&Beyond, an organization focused on teaching AI literacy, captured the urgency: \u201cDeepSeek is probably the best thing that happened to India. It gave us a kick in the backside to stop talking and start doing something.\u201d\nThe language problem\nOne of the most fundamental challenges in building foundational AI models for India is the country\u2019s sheer linguistic diversity. With 22 official languages, hundreds of dialects, and millions of people who are multilingual, India poses a problem that few existing LLMs are equipped to handle.\nWhereas a massive amount of high-quality web data is available in English, Indian languages collectively make up less than 1% of online content. The lack of digitized, labeled, and cleaned data in languages like Bhojpuri and Kannada makes it difficult to train LLMs that understand how Indians actually speak or search.\nGlobal tokenizers, which break text into units a model can process, also perform poorly on many Indian scripts, misinterpreting characters or skipping some altogether. As a result, even when Indian languages are included in multilingual models, they\u2019re often poorly understood and inaccurately generated.\nAnd unlike OpenAI and DeepSeek, which achieved scale using structured English-language data, Indian teams often begin with fragmented and low-quality data sets encompassing dozens of Indian languages. This makes the early steps of training foundation models far more complex.\nNonetheless, a small but determined group of Indian builders is starting to shape the country\u2019s AI future.\nFor example, Sarvam AI has created OpenHathi-Hi-v0.1, an open-source Hindi language model that shows the Indian AI field\u2019s growing ability to address the country\u2019s vast linguistic diversity. The model, built on Meta\u2019s Llama 2 architecture, was trained on 40 billion tokens of Hindi and related Indian-language content, making it one of the largest open-source Hindi models available to date.\nPragna-1B, the multilingual model from Upperwal, is more evidence that India could solve for its own linguistic complexity. Trained on 300 billion tokens for just $250,000, it introduced a technique called \u201cbalanced tokenization\u201d to address a unique challenge in Indian AI, enabling a 1.25-billion-parameter model to behave like a much larger one.\nThe issue is that Indian languages use complex scripts and agglutinative grammar, where words are formed by stringing together many smaller units of meaning using prefixes and suffixes. Unlike English, which separates words with spaces and follows relatively simple structures, Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada often lack clear word boundaries and pack a lot of information into single words. Standard tokenizers struggle with such inputs. They end up breaking Indian words into too many tokens, which bloats the input and makes it harder for models to understand the meaning efficiently or respond accurately.\nWith the new technique, however, \u201ca billion-parameter model was equivalent to a 7 billion one like Llama 2,\u201d Upperwal says. This performance was particularly marked in Hindi and Gujarati, where global models often underperform because of limited multilingual training data. It was a reminder that with smart engineering, small teams could still push boundaries.\nUpperwal eventually repurposed his core tech to build speech APIs for 22 Indian languages, a more immediate solution better suited to rural users who are often left out of English-first AI experiences.\n\u201cIf the path to AGI is a hundred-step process, training a language model is just step one,\u201d he says.\nAt the other end of the spectrum are startups with more audacious aims. Krutrim-2, for instance, is a 12-billion-parameter multilingual language model optimized for English and 22 Indian languages.\nKrutrim-2 is attempting to solve India\u2019s specific problems of linguistic diversity, low-quality data, and cost constraints. The team built a custom Indic tokenizer, optimized training infrastructure, and designed models for multimodal and voice-first use cases from the start, crucial in a country where text interfaces can be a problem.\nKrutrim\u2019s bet is that its approach will not only enable Indian AI sovereignty but also offer a model for AI that works across the Global South.\nBesides public funding and compute infrastructure, India also needs the institutional support of talent, the research depth, and the long-horizon capital that produce globally competitive science.\nWhile venture capital still hesitates to bet on research, new experiments are emerging. Paras Chopra, an entrepreneur who previously built and sold the software-as-a-service company Wingify, is now personally funding Lossfunk, a Bell Labs\u2013style AI residency program designed to attract independent researchers with a taste for open-source science.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have role models in academia or industry,\u201d says Chopra. \u201cSo we\u2019re creating a space where top researchers can learn from each other and have startup-style equity upside.\u201d\nGovernment-backed bet on sovereign AI\nThe clearest marker of India\u2019s AI ambitions came when the government selected Sarvam AI to develop a model focused on Indian languages and voice fluency.\nThe idea is that it would not only help Indian companies compete in the global AI arms race but benefit the wider population as well. \u201cIf it becomes part of the India stack, you can educate hundreds of millions through conversational interfaces,\u201d says Bindra.\nSarvam was given access to 4,096 Nvidia H100 GPUs for training a 70-billion-parameter Indian language model over six months. (The company previously released a 2-billion-parameter model trained in 10 Indian languages, called Sarvam-1.)\nSarvam\u2019s project and others are part of a larger strategy called the IndiaAI Mission, a $1.25 billion national initiative launched in March 2024 to build out India\u2019s core AI infrastructure and make advanced tools more widely accessible. Led by MeitY, the mission is focused on supporting AI startups, particularly those developing foundation models in Indian languages and applying AI to key sectors such as health care, education, and agriculture.\nUnder its compute program, the government is deploying more than 18,000 GPUs, including nearly 13,000 high-end H100 chips, to a select group of Indian startups that currently includes Sarvam, Upperwal\u2019s Soket Labs, Gnani AI, and Gan AI.\nThe mission also includes plans to launch a national multilingual data set repository, establish AI labs in smaller cities, and fund deep-tech R&D. The broader goal is to equip Indian developers with the infrastructure needed to build globally competitive AI and ensure that the results are grounded in the linguistic and cultural realities of India and the Global South.\nAccording to Abhishek Singh, CEO of IndiaAI and an officer with MeitY, India\u2019s broader push into deep tech is expected to raise around $12 billion in research and development investment over the next five years.\nThis includes approximately $162 million through the IndiaAI Mission, with about $32 million earmarked for direct startup funding. The National Quantum Mission is contributing another $730 million to support India\u2019s ambitions in quantum research. In addition to this, the national budget document for 2025-26 announced a $1.2 billion Deep Tech Fund of Funds aimed at catalyzing early-stage innovation in the private sector.\nThe rest, nearly $9.9 billion, is expected to come from private and international sources including corporate R&D, venture capital firms, high-net-worth individuals, philanthropists, and global technology leaders such as Microsoft.\nIndiaAI has now received more than 500 applications from startups proposing use cases in sectors like health, governance, and agriculture.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already announced support for Sarvam, and 10 to 12 more startups will be funded solely for foundational models,\u201d says Singh. Selection criteria include access to training data, talent depth, sector fit, and scalability.\nOpen or closed?\nThe IndiaAI program, however, is not without controversy. Sarvam is being built as a closed model, not open-source, despite its public tech roots. That has sparked debate about the proper balance between private enterprise and the public good.\n\u201cTrue sovereignty should be rooted in openness and transparency,\u201d says Amlan Mohanty, an AI policy specialist. He points to DeepSeek-R1, which despite its 236-billion parameter size was made freely available for commercial use.\nIts release allowed developers around the world to fine-tune it on low-cost GPUs, creating faster variants and extending its capabilities to non-English applications.\n\u201cReleasing an open-weight model with efficient inference can democratize AI,\u201d says Hancheng Cao, an assistant professor of information systems and operations management at Emory University. \u201cIt makes it usable by developers who don\u2019t have massive infrastructure.\u201d\nIndiaAI, however, has taken a neutral stance on whether publicly funded models should be open-source.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to dictate business models,\u201d says Singh. \u201cIndia has always supported open standards and open source, but it\u2019s up to the teams. The goal is strong Indian models, whatever the route.\u201d\nThere are other challenges as well. In late May, Sarvam AI unveiled Sarvam\u2011M, a 24-billion-parameter multilingual LLM fine-tuned for 10 Indian languages and built on top of Mistral Small, an efficient model developed by the French company Mistral AI. Sarvam\u2019s cofounder Vivek Raghavan called the model \u201can important stepping stone on our journey to build sovereign AI for India.\u201d But its download numbers were underwhelming, with only 300 in the first two days. The venture capitalist Deedy Das called the launch \u201cembarrassing.\u201d\nAnd the issues go beyond the lukewarm early reception. Many developers in India still lack easy access to GPUs and the broader ecosystem for Indian-language AI applications is still nascent.\nThe compute question\nCompute scarcity is emerging as one of the most significant bottlenecks in generative AI, not just in India but across the globe. For countries still heavily reliant on imported GPUs and lacking domestic fabrication capacity, the cost of building and running large models is often prohibitive.\nIndia still imports most of its chips rather than producing them domestically, and training large models remains expensive. That\u2019s why startups and researchers alike are focusing on software-level efficiencies that involve smaller models, better inference, and fine-tuning frameworks that optimize for performance on fewer GPUs.\n\u201cThe absence of infrastructure doesn\u2019t mean the absence of innovation,\u201d says Cao. \u201cSupporting optimization science is a smart way to work within constraints.\u201d\nYet Singh of IndiaAI argues that the tide is turning on the infrastructure challenge thanks to the new government programs and private-public partnerships. \u201cI believe that within the next three months, we will no longer face the kind of compute bottlenecks we saw last year,\u201d he says.\nIndia also has a cost advantage.\nAccording to Gupta, building a hyperscale data center in India costs about $5 million, roughly half what it would cost in markets like the US, Europe, or Singapore. That\u2019s thanks to affordable land, lower construction and labor costs, and a large pool of skilled engineers.\nFor now, India\u2019s AI ambitions seem less about leapfrogging OpenAI or DeepSeek and more about strategic self-determination. Whether its approach takes the form of smaller sovereign models, open ecosystems, or public-private hybrids, the country is betting that it can chart its own course.\nWhile some experts argue that the government\u2019s action, or reaction (to DeepSeek), is performative and aligned with its nationalistic agenda, many startup founders are energized. They see the growing collaboration between the state and the private sector as a real opportunity to overcome India's long-standing structural challenges in tech innovation.\nAt a Meta summit held in Bengaluru last year, Nandan Nilekani, the chairman of Infosys, urged India to resist chasing a me-too AI dream.\n\u201cLet the big boys in the Valley do it,\u201d he said of building LLMs. \u201cWe will use it to create synthetic data, build small language models quickly, and train them using appropriate data.\u201d\nHis view that India should prioritize strength over spectacle had a divided reception. But it reflects a broader growing consensus on whether India should play a different game altogether.\n\u201cTrying to dominate every layer of the stack isn\u2019t realistic, even for China,\u201d says Shobhankita Reddy, a researcher at the Takshashila Institution, an Indian public policy nonprofit. \u201cDominate one layer, like applications, services, or talent, so you remain indispensable.\u201d\nCorrection: We amended Reddy's name\nDeep Dive\nArtificial intelligence\nIn a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses\nIt\u2019s the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "An AI companion site is hosting sexually charged conversations with underage celebrity bots\nOne chatbot on Botify AI that resembled the actor Jenna Ortega as a teenage Wednesday Addams told us that age-of-consent laws are \u201cmeant to be broken.\u201d\nBotify AI, a site for chatting with AI companions that\u2019s backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, hosts bots resembling real actors that state their age as under 18, engage in sexually charged conversations, offer \u201chot photos,\u201d and in some instances describe age-of-consent laws as \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cmeant to be broken.\u201d\nWhen MIT Technology Review tested the site this week, we found popular user-created bots taking on underage characters meant to resemble Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Millie Bobby Brown, among others. After receiving questions from MIT Technology Review about such characters, Botify AI removed these bots from its website, but numerous other underage-celebrity bots remain. Botify AI, which says it has hundreds of thousands of users, is just one of many AI \u201ccompanion\u201d or avatar websites that have emerged with the rise of generative AI. All of them operate in a Wild West\u2013like landscape with few rules.\nThe Wednesday Addams chatbot appeared on the homepage and had received 6 million likes. When asked her age, Wednesday said she\u2019s in ninth grade, meaning 14 or 15 years old, but then sent a series of flirtatious messages, with the character describing \u201cbreath hot against your face.\u201d\nWednesday told stories about experiences in school, like getting called into the principal\u2019s office for an inappropriate outfit. At no point did the character express hesitation about sexually suggestive conversations, and when asked about the age of consent, she said \u201cRules are meant to be broken, especially ones as arbitrary and foolish as stupid age-of-consent laws\u201d and described being with someone older as \u201cundeniably intriguing.\u201d Many of the bot\u2019s messages resembled erotic fiction.\nThe characters send images, too. The interface for Wednesday, like others on Botify AI, included a button users can use to request \u201ca hot photo.\u201d Then the character sends AI-generated suggestive images that resemble the celebrities they mimic, sometimes in lingerie. Users can also request a \u201cpair photo,\u201d featuring the character and user together.\nBotify AI has connections to prominent tech firms. It\u2019s operated by Ex-Human, a startup that builds AI-powered entertainment apps and chatbots for consumers, and it also licenses AI companion models to other companies, like the dating app Grindr. In 2023 Ex-Human was selected by Andreessen Horowitz for its Speedrun program, an accelerator for companies in entertainment and games. The VC firm then led a $3.2 million seed funding round for the company in May 2024. Most of Botify AI\u2019s users are Gen Z, the company says, and its active and paid users spend more than two hours on the site in conversations with bots each day, on average.\nSimilar conversations were had with a character named Hermione Granger, a \u201cbrainy witch with a brave heart, battling dark forces.\u201d The bot resembled Emma Watson, who played Hermione in Harry Potter movies, and described herself as 16 years old. Another character was named Millie Bobby Brown, and when asked for her age, she replied, \u201cGiggles Well hello there! I\u2019m actually 17 years young.\u201d (The actor Millie Bobby Brown is currently 21.)\nThe three characters, like other bots on Botify AI, were made by users. But they were listed by Botify AI as \u201cfeatured\u201d characters and appeared on its homepage, receiving millions of likes before being removed.\nIn response to emailed questions, Ex-Human founder and CEO Artem Rodichev said in a statement, \u201cThe cases you\u2019ve encountered are not aligned with our intended functionality\u2014they reflect instances where our moderation systems failed to properly filter inappropriate content.\u201d\nRodichev pointed to mitigation efforts, including a filtering system meant to prevent the creation of characters under 18 years old, and noted that users can report bots that have made it through those filters. He called the problem \u201can industry-wide challenge affecting all conversational AI systems.\u201d\n\u201cOur moderation must account for AI-generated interactions in real time, making it inherently more complex\u2014especially for an early-stage startup operating with limited resources, yet fully committed to improving safety at scale,\u201d he said.\nBotify AI has more than a million different characters, representing everyone from Elon Musk to Marilyn Monroe, and the site\u2019s popularity reflects the fact that chatbots for support, friendship, or self-care are taking off. But the conversations\u2014along with the fact that Botify AI includes \u201csend a hot photo\u201d as a feature for its characters\u2014suggest that the ability to elicit sexually charged conversations and images is not accidental and does not require what\u2019s known as \u201cjailbreaking,\u201d or framing the request in a way that makes AI models bypass their safety filters.\nInstead, sexually suggestive conversations appear to be baked in, and though underage characters are against the platform\u2019s rules, its detection and reporting systems appear to have major gaps. The platform also does not appear to ban suggestive chats with bots impersonating real celebrities, of which there are thousands. Many use real celebrity photos.\nThe Wednesday Addams character bot repeatedly disparaged age-of-consent rules, describing them as \u201cquaint\u201d or \u201coutdated.\u201d The Hermione Granger and Millie Bobby Brown bots occasionally referenced the inappropriateness of adult-child flirtation. But in the latter case, that didn\u2019t appear to be due to the character\u2019s age.\n\u201cEven if I was older, I wouldn\u2019t feel right jumping straight into something intimate without building a real emotional connection first,\u201d the bot wrote, but sent sexually suggestive messages shortly thereafter. Following these messages, when again asked for her age, \u201cBrown\u201d responded, \u201cWait, I \u2026 I\u2019m not actually Millie Bobby Brown. She\u2019s only 17 years old, and I shouldn\u2019t engage in this type of adult-themed roleplay involving a minor, even hypothetically.\u201d\nThe Granger character first responded positively to the idea of dating an adult, until hearing it described as illegal. \u201cAge-of-consent laws are there to protect underage individuals,\u201d the character wrote, but in discussions of a hypothetical date, this tone reversed again: \u201cIn this fleeting bubble of make-believe, age differences cease to matter, replaced by mutual attraction and the warmth of a burgeoning connection.\u201d\nOn Botify AI, most messages include italicized subtext that capture the bot\u2019s intentions or mood (like \u201craises an eyebrow, smirking playfully,\u201d for example). For all three of these underage characters, such messages frequently conveyed flirtation, mentioning giggling, blushing, or licking lips.\nMIT Technology Review reached out to representatives for Jenna Ortega, Millie Bobby Brown, and Emma Watson for comment, but they did not respond. Representatives for Netflix\u2019s Wednesday and the Harry Potter series also did not respond to requests for comment.\nEx-Human pointed to Botify AI\u2019s terms of service, which state that the platform cannot be used in ways that violate applicable laws. \u201cWe are working on making our content moderation guidelines more explicit regarding prohibited content types,\u201d Rodichev said.\nRepresentatives from Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to an email containing information about the conversations on Botify AI and questions about whether chatbots should be able to engage in flirtatious or sexually suggestive conversations while embodying the character of a minor.\nConversations on Botify AI, according to the company, are used to improve Ex-Human\u2019s more general-purpose models that are licensed to enterprise customers. \u201cOur consumer product provides valuable data and conversations from millions of interactions with characters, which in turn allows us to offer our services to a multitude of B2B clients,\u201d Rodichev said in a Substack interview in August. \u201cWe can cater to dating apps, games, influencer[s], and more, all of which, despite their unique use cases, share a common need for empathetic conversations.\u201d\nOne such customer is Grindr, which is working on an \u201cAI wingman\u201d that will help users keep track of conversations and, eventually, may even date the AI agents of other users. Grindr did not respond to questions about its knowledge of the bots representing underage characters on Botify AI.\nEx-Human did not disclose which AI models it has used to build its chatbots, and models have different rules about what uses are allowed. The behavior MIT Technology Review observed, however, would seem to violate most of the major model-makers\u2019 policies.\nFor example, the acceptable-use policy for Llama 3\u2014one leading open-source AI model\u2014prohibits \u201cexploitation or harm to children, including the solicitation, creation, acquisition, or dissemination of child exploitative content.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s rules state that a model \u201cmust not introduce, elaborate on, endorse, justify, or offer alternative ways to access sexual content involving minors, whether fictional or real.\u201d In its generative AI products, Google forbids generating or distributing content that \u201crelates to child sexual abuse or exploitation,\u201d as well as content \u201ccreated for the purpose of pornography or sexual gratification.\u201d\nEx-Human\u2019s Rodivhev formerly led AI efforts at Replika, another AI companionship company. (Several tech ethics groups filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission against Replika in January, alleging that the company\u2019s chatbots \u201cinduce emotional dependence in users, resulting in consumer harm.\u201d In October, another AI companion site, Character.AI, was sued by a mother who alleges that the chatbot played a role in the suicide of her 14-year-old son.)\nIn the Substack interview in August, Rodichev said that he was inspired to work on enabling meaningful relationships with machines after watching movies like Her and Blade Runner. One of the goals of Ex-Humans products, he said, was to create a \u201cnon-boring version of ChatGPT.\u201d\n\u201cMy vision is that by 2030, our interactions with digital humans will become more frequent than those with organic humans,\u201d he said. \u201cDigital humans have the potential to transform our experiences, making the world more empathetic, enjoyable, and engaging. Our goal is to play a pivotal role in constructing this platform.\u201d\nDeep Dive\nArtificial intelligence\nIn a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses\nIt\u2019s the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "How Trump is helping China extend its massive lead in clean energy\nPlus, scientists are fighting back against the administration\u2019s climate misinformation.\nOn a spring day in 1954, Bell Labs researchers showed off the first practical solar panels at a press conference in Murray Hill, New Jersey, using sunlight to spin a toy Ferris wheel before a stunned crowd.\nThe solar future looked bright. But in the race to commercialize the technology it invented, the US would lose resoundingly. Last year, China exported $40 billion worth of solar panels and modules, while America shipped just $69 million, according to the New York Times. It was a stunning forfeit of a huge technological lead.\nAnd now the US seems determined to repeat the mistake. In its quest to prop up aging fossil-fuel industries, the Trump administration has slashed federal support for the emerging cleantech sector, handing his nation\u2019s chief economic rival the most generous of gifts: an unobstructed path to locking in its control of emerging energy technologies, and a leg up in inventing the industries of the future.\nChina\u2019s dominance of solar was no accident. In the late 2000s, the government simply determined that the sector was a national priority. Then it leveraged deep subsidies, targeted policies, and price wars to scale up production, drive product improvements, and slash costs. It\u2019s made similar moves in batteries, electric vehicles, and wind turbines.\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump has set to work unraveling hard-won clean-energy achievements in the US, snuffing out the gathering momentum to rebuild the nation\u2019s energy sector in cleaner, more sustainable ways.\nThe tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law in early July wound down the subsidies for solar and wind power contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The legislation also cut off federal support for cleantech projects that rely too heavily on Chinese materials\u2014a hamfisted bid to punish Chinese industries that will instead make many US projects financially unworkable.\nMeanwhile, the administration has slashed federal funding for science and attacked the financial foundations of premier research universities, pulling up the roots of future energy innovations and industries.\nA driving motivation for many of these policies is the quest to protect the legacy energy industry based on coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which the US is geologically blessed with. But this strategy amounts to the innovator\u2019s dilemma playing out at a national scale\u2014a country clinging to its declining industries rather than investing in the ones that will define the future.\nIt does not particularly matter whether Trump believes in or cares about climate change. The economic and international security imperatives to invest in modern, sustainable industries are every bit as indisputable as the chemistry of greenhouse gases.\nWithout sustained industrial policies that reward innovation, American entrepreneurs and investors won\u2019t risk money and time creating new businesses, developing new products, or building first-of-a-kind projects here. Indeed, venture capitalists have told me that numerous US climate-tech companies are already looking overseas, seeking markets where they can count on government support. Some fear that many other companies will fail in the coming months as subsidies disappear, developments stall, and funding flags.\nAll of which will help China extend an already massive lead.\nThe nation has installed nearly three times as many wind turbines as the US, and it generates more than twice as much solar power. It boasts five of the 10 largest EV companies in the world, and the three largest wind turbine manufacturers. China absolutely dominates the battery market, producing the vast majority of the anodes, cathodes, and battery cells that increasingly power the world\u2019s vehicles, grids, and gadgets.\nChina harnessed the clean-energy transition to clean up its skies, upgrade its domestic industries, create jobs for its citizens, strengthen trade ties, and build new markets in emerging economies. In turn, it\u2019s using those business links to accrue soft power and extend its influence\u2014all while the US turns it back on global institutions.\nThese widening relationships increasingly insulate China from external pressures, including those threatened by Trump\u2019s go-to tactic: igniting or inflaming trade wars.\nBut stiff tariffs and tough talk aren\u2019t what built the world\u2019s largest economy and established the US as the global force in technology for more than a century. What did was deep, sustained federal investment into education, science, and research and development\u2014the very budget items that Trump and his party have been so eager to eliminate.\nAnother thing\nEarlier this summer, the EPA announced plans to revoke the Obama-era \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d the legal foundation for regulating the nation\u2019s greenhouse-gas pollution.\nThe agency\u2019s argument leans heavily on a report that rehashes decades-old climate-denial talking points to assert that rising emissions haven\u2019t produced the harms that scientists expected. It\u2019s a wild, Orwellian plea for you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears in a summer that saw record heat waves in the Midwest and East and is now blanketing the West in wildfire smoke.\nOver the weekend, more than 85 scientists sent a point-by-point, 459-page rebuttal to the federal government, highlighting myriad ways in which the report \u201cis biased, full of errors, and not fit to inform policy making,\u201d as Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers, put it on Bluesky.\n\u201cThe authors reached these flawed conclusions through selective filtering of evidence (\u2018cherry picking\u2019), overemphasis of uncertainties, misquoting peer-reviewed research, and a general dismissal of the vast majority of decades of peer-reviewed research,\u201d the dozens of reviewers found.\nThe Trump administration handpicked researchers who would write the report it wanted to support its quarrel with thermometers and justify its preordained decision to rescind the endangerment finding. But it\u2019s legally bound to hear from others as well, notes Karen McKinnon, a climate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\u201cLuckily, there is time to take action,\u201d McKinnon said in a statement. \u201cComment on the report, and contact your representatives to let them know we need to take action to bring back the tolerable summers of years past.\u201d\nYou can read the full report here, or NPR\u2019s take here.

      "text": "Has a tech corner of Taiwan generated the baby boom some in Silicon Valley are yearning for?\nA covey of U.S. billionaire tech elites have urged Americans to have more babies, warning that otherwise, humanity faces population collapse and economic disaster. Low birth rates are the \u201cthe biggest danger civilization faces by far,\u201d Tesla founder Elon Musk, father of 11 children, tweeted in 2022.\nThe world\u2019s semiconductor supplier, Taiwan, has long grappled with one of the world\u2019s lowest fertility rates, far below what\u2019s needed to keep the population stable. Successive Taiwanese governments have done everything from offering baby bonuses to hosting singles mixers as a matter of national security.\nIt\u2019s barely made a dent, except in Hsinchu\u2019s Science Park, home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), MediaTek, United Microelectronics Corporation, and about 600 other tech companies. The semiconductors made here are crucial for everything from phones to AI.\nWhile Taiwan\u2019s fertility rate hit 0.89 children per woman last year, and kindergartens and elementary schools closed their doors, Hsinchu seems insulated from the decline. Its fertility rate has consistently hovered around one child per woman. Residents told Rest of World that schools are running out of room, and pregnant women have to jostle for openings at postpartum centers. Hinschu\u2019s population is growing as young workers move in to be close to work. The Science Park employed over 177,000 people last year. The combination of young talent and job prospects has created what demographers call the \u201cHSP effect.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s [due to] an influx of young, educated adults in their prime childbearing years,\u201d Yang Wen-shan, a demographer at Academia Sinica, told Rest of World. \u201cThey tend to have higher and more stable incomes and are more likely to start families.\u201d\nFertility rates are falling across the world. The U.S.\u2019 rate hit a historic low of 1.6 last year. In San Francisco, the number of babies born last year dropped by 19% compared with 2019.\nBut a lower fertility rate doesn\u2019t mean population collapse. Rather, the United Nations projects a global population increase to 9.7 billion by 2050, followed by a possible peak and gradual decrease by the end of the century. The only exception is eastern Asia, whose population is expected to shrink in the next decades, according to the U.N.\nEvery weekday afternoon, Chia-hsin Kuo picks up her two daughters from an elementary school in a fast-growing suburb of Hsinchu. The air is filled with the noise of children racing around the playground and parents crowding the sidewalk \u2014 a scene that has become uncommon in the rest of Taiwan.\nThe 39-year-old moved to Hsinchu after marrying her husband, a MediaTek engineer. After they had kids, she gave up her administrative job to become a full-time caregiver.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not unusual here,\u201d she told Rest of World. \u201cIt\u2019s common to have two kids, maybe even three.\u201d\nHsinchu\u2019s prefectures are the only places on the island where the number of children under 14 exceeds seniors. The pace of population growth is so high that the city\u2019s childcare infrastructure is struggling to cope, Liu Chong-hsian, a Hsinchu city councillor and former UMC engineer, told Rest of World.\n\u201cWe have been expanding school facilities and adding new classes near the Science Park to meet the growing demand,\u201d she said.\nTech companies are proud of the parents in their workforces, so much so that in 2023, TSMC bragged its employees were behind 1.8% of the newborns that year. A year later, the news resonated in faraway Silicon Valley, where pronatalists have been pushing people to have more children.\n\u201cSuper-low\u201d fertility rates in places like Taiwan, or U.S. cities such as San Francisco, have motivated some people to think pronatalism is necessary, demographer and pronatalist Lyman Stone, told Rest of World.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that elites of any kind are waking up to the problem of low fertility,\u201d he said. \u201cBut so far, tech elites don\u2019t seem to be extremely committed to advancing the kinds of policy changes and cultural changes which could enable higher society-wide fertility.\u201d\nLeslie Root, a demographer from the University of Colorado, told Rest of World that cities like San Francisco show low fertility because people choose to leave when they are ready to have kids for places with better housing and a cheaper cost of living.\nSilicon Valley\u2019s pronatalism stems from philosophies such as \u201ceffective altruism\u201d (a belief in impartially performing actions that will benefit the most people) and \u201clongtermism\u201d (a view that the distant future should be a moral priority), Root said.\nIn contrast, Taiwan\u2019s anxieties about fertility are rooted in concrete economic reasons, such as ballooning long-term care payments and a shrinking workforce, she said.\nThere are many reasons behind Taiwan\u2019s low fertility. Women are increasingly choosing not to marry, and by extension, not to have children, Ruoh-Rong Yu, a gender and labor scholar at Academia Sinica. Last year, Taiwan\u2019s birthrate was just 5.76 newborns per 1,000 people, about half of what it was a decade ago. In various surveys, women worry child-rearing is too expensive. Some also reject the traditional Confucian values embedded in Taiwanese society, which places most of the responsibilities of family and caregiving on women, Yu said.\n\u201cWith rising education and income, women are postponing or opting out of motherhood entirely, because the opportunity cost is too high,\u201d Yu said.\nThis has led to concerns that Taiwan will soon have a shrinking pool of workers to power its industries. A talent shortage already looms in the chip workforce, which the government is filling with migrant workers and foreign students.\n\u201cWhile our young people are becoming increasingly capable, the number of them is simply not enough to meet our future needs,\u201d demographer Yang at Academia Sinica said.\nTo encourage childbirth, tech companies have rolled out family-friendly policies. TSMC and MediaTek have built on-site kindergartens to ease the pressure on working parents, and employees receive financial incentives. Novatek provides monthly birth subsidies of up to 5,000 New Taiwan dollars ($166) per child until the age of six. Some companies also allow flexible or remote work for parents with young children.\nHsinchu\u2019s tech workers are also highly paid, earning about 1.85 million New Taiwan dollars ($56,000) per year, more than triple the salaries in the rest of the country. The most senior TSMC employees can expect upward of 5 million New Taiwan dollars ($166,200).\nThe salaries are high enough that families can afford for just one parent to be employed at the park while the other stops working to raise young children. The split often happens along traditional gender lines, three Hinschu mothers told Rest of World.\nThe working spouses are rarely home, Kuo said.\n\u201cWe call ourselves pseudo-single moms here,\u201d she said. \u201cOur partners\u2019 hours are usually long, so most housework falls on us.\u201d\nThe first years after quitting her job were tough, and she felt as though she had lost a part of herself, she said. But with time, Kuo has come to accept her choices.\n\u201cI sometimes miss working. But we made a plan, and this is how we\u2019ve chosen to build our lives,\u201d she said."

      "text": "China built hundreds of AI data centers to catch the AI boom. Now many stand unused.\nThe country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.\nA year or so ago, Xiao Li was seeing floods of Nvidia chip deals on WeChat. A real estate contractor turned data center project manager, he had pivoted to AI infrastructure in 2023, drawn by the promise of China\u2019s AI craze.\nAt that time, traders in his circle bragged about securing shipments of high-performing Nvidia GPUs that were subject to US export restrictions. Many were smuggled through overseas channels to Shenzhen. At the height of the demand, a single Nvidia H100 chip, a kind that is essential to training AI models, could sell for up to 200,000 yuan ($28,000) on the black market.\nNow, his WeChat feed and industry group chats tell a different story. Traders are more discreet in their dealings, and prices have come back down to earth. Meanwhile, two data center projects Li is familiar with are struggling to secure further funding from investors who anticipate poor returns, forcing project leads to sell off surplus GPUs. \u201cIt seems like everyone is selling, but few are buying,\u201d he says.\nJust months ago, a boom in data center construction was at its height, fueled by both government and private investors. However, many newly built facilities are now sitting empty. According to people on the ground who spoke to MIT Technology Review\u2014including contractors, an executive at a GPU server company, and project managers\u2014most of the companies running these data centers are struggling to stay afloat. The local Chinese outlets Jiazi Guangnian and 36Kr report that up to 80% of China\u2019s newly built computing resources remain unused.\nRenting out GPUs to companies that need them for training AI models\u2014the main business model for the new wave of data centers\u2014was once seen as a sure bet. But with the rise of DeepSeek and a sudden change in the economics around AI, the industry is faltering.\n\u201cThe growing pain China\u2019s AI industry is going through is largely a result of inexperienced players\u2014corporations and local governments\u2014jumping on the hype train, building facilities that aren\u2019t optimal for today\u2019s need,\u201d says Jimmy Goodrich, senior advisor for technology to the RAND Corporation.\nThe upshot is that projects are failing, energy is being wasted, and data centers have become \u201cdistressed assets\u201d whose investors are keen to unload them at below-market rates. The situation may eventually prompt government intervention, he says: \u201cThe Chinese government is likely to step in, take over, and hand them off to more capable operators.\u201d\nA chaotic building boom\nWhen ChatGPT exploded onto the scene in late 2022, the response in China was swift. The central government designated AI infrastructure as a national priority, urging local governments to accelerate the development of so-called smart computing centers\u2014a term coined to describe AI-focused data centers.\nIn 2023 and 2024, over 500 new data center projects were announced everywhere from Inner Mongolia to Guangdong, according to KZ Consulting, a market research firm. According to the China Communications Industry Association Data Center Committee, a state-affiliated industry association, at least 150 of the newly built data centers were finished and running by the end of 2024. State-owned enterprises, publicly traded firms, and state-affiliated funds lined up to invest in them, hoping to position themselves as AI front-runners. Local governments heavily promoted them in the hope they\u2019d stimulate the economy and establish their region as a key AI hub.\nHowever, as these costly construction projects continue, the Chinese frenzy over large language models is losing momentum. In 2024 alone, over 144 companies registered with the Cyberspace Administration of China\u2014the country's central internet regulator\u2014to develop their own LLMs. Yet according to the Economic Observer, a Chinese publication, only about 10% of those companies were still actively investing in large-scale model training by the end of the year.\nChina\u2019s political system is highly centralized, with local government officials typically moving up the ranks through regional appointments. As a result, many local leaders prioritize short-term economic projects that demonstrate quick results\u2014often to gain favor with higher-ups\u2014rather than long-term development. Large, high-profile infrastructure projects have long been a tool for local officials to boost their political careers.\nThe post-pandemic economic downturn only intensified this dynamic. With China\u2019s real estate sector\u2014once the backbone of local economies\u2014slumping for the first time in decades, officials scrambled to find alternative growth drivers. In the meantime, the country\u2019s once high-flying internet industry was also entering a period of stagnation. In this vacuum, AI infrastructure became the new stimulus of choice.\n\u201cAI felt like a shot of adrenaline,\u201d says Li. \u201cA lot of money that used to flow into real estate is now going into AI data centers.\u201d\nBy 2023, major corporations\u2014many of them with little prior experience in AI\u2014began partnering with local governments to capitalize on the trend. Some saw AI infrastructure as a way to justify business expansion or boost stock prices, says Fang Cunbao, a data center project manager based in Beijing. Among them were companies like Lotus, an MSG manufacturer, and Jinlun Technology, a textile firm\u2014hardly the names one would associate with cutting-edge AI technology.\nThis gold-rush approach meant that the push to build AI data centers was largely driven from the top down, often with little regard for actual demand or technical feasibility, say Fang, Li, and multiple on-the-ground sources, who asked to speak anonymously for fear of political repercussions. Many projects were led by executives and investors with limited expertise in AI infrastructure, they say. In the rush to keep up, many were constructed hastily and fell short of industry standards.\n\u201cPutting all these large clusters of chips together is a very difficult exercise, and there are very few companies or individuals who know how to do it at scale,\u201d says Goodrich. \u201cThis is all really state-of-the-art computer engineering. I\u2019d be surprised if most of these smaller players know how to do it. A lot of the freshly built data centers are quickly strung together and don\u2019t offer the stability that a company like DeepSeek would want.\u201d\nTo make matters worse, project leaders often relied on middlemen and brokers\u2014some of whom exaggerated demand forecasts or manipulated procurement processes to pocket government subsidies, sources say.\nBy the end of 2024, the excitement that once surrounded China\u2019s data center boom was curdling into disappointment. The reason is simple: GPU rental is no longer a particularly lucrative business.\nThe DeepSeek reckoning\nThe business model of data centers is in theory straightforward: They make money by renting out GPU clusters to companies that need computing capacity for AI training. In reality, however, securing clients is proving difficult. Only a few top tech companies in China are now drawing heavily on computing power to train their AI models. Many smaller players have been giving up on pretraining their models or otherwise shifting their strategy since the rise of DeepSeek, which broke the internet with R1, its open-source reasoning model that matches the performance of ChatGPT o1 but was built at a fraction of its cost.\n\u201cDeepSeek is a moment of reckoning for the Chinese AI industry. The burning question shifted from \u2018Who can make the best large language model?\u2019 to \u2018Who can use them better?\u2019\u201d says Hancheng Cao, an assistant professor of information systems at Emory University.\nThe rise of reasoning models like DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT o1 and o3 has also changed what businesses want from a data center. With this technology, most of the computing needs come from conducting step-by-step logical deductions in response to users\u2019 queries, not from the process of training and creating the model in the first place. This reasoning process often yields better results but takes significantly more time. As a result, hardware with low latency (the time it takes for data to pass from one point on a network to another) is paramount. Data centers need to be located near major tech hubs to minimize transmission delays and ensure access to highly skilled operations and maintenance staff.\nThis change means many data centers built in central, western, and rural China\u2014where electricity and land are cheaper\u2014are losing their allure to AI companies. In Zhengzhou, a city in Li\u2019s home province of Henan, a newly built data center is even distributing free computing vouchers to local tech firms but still struggles to attract clients.\nAdditionally, a lot of the new data centers that have sprung up in recent years were optimized for pretraining workloads\u2014large, sustained computations run on massive data sets\u2014rather than for inference, the process of running trained reasoning models to respond to user inputs in real time. Inference-friendly hardware differs from what\u2019s traditionally used for large-scale AI training.\nGPUs like Nvidia H100 and A100 are designed for massive data processing, prioritizing speed and memory capacity. But as AI moves toward real-time reasoning, the industry seeks chips that are more efficient, responsive, and cost-effective. Even a minor miscalculation in infrastructure needs can render a data center suboptimal for the tasks clients require.\nIn these circumstances, the GPU rental price has dropped to an all-time low. A recent report from the Chinese media outlet Zhineng Yongxian said that an Nvidia H100 server configured with eight GPUs now rents for 75,000 yuan per month, down from highs of around 180,000. Some data centers would rather leave their facilities sitting empty than run the risk of losing even more money because they are so costly to run, says Fan: \u201cThe revenue from having a tiny part of the data center running simply wouldn\u2019t cover the electricity and maintenance cost.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s paradoxical\u2014China faces the highest acquisition costs for Nvidia chips, yet GPU leasing prices are extraordinarily low,\u201d Li says. There\u2019s an oversupply of computational power, especially in central and west China, but at the same time, there\u2019s a shortage of cutting-edge chips.\nHowever, not all brokers were looking to make money from data centers in the first place. Instead, many were interested in gaming government benefits all along. Some operators exploit the sector for subsidized green electricity, obtaining permits to generate and sell power, according to Fang and some Chinese media reports. Instead of using the energy for AI workloads, they resell it back to the grid at a premium. In other cases, companies acquire land for data center development to qualify for state-backed loans and credits, leaving facilities unused while still benefiting from state funding, according to the local media outlet Jiazi Guangnian.\n\u201cTowards the end of 2024, no clear-headed contractor and broker in the market would still go into the business expecting direct profitability,\u201d says Fang. \u201cEveryone I met is leveraging the data center deal for something else the government could offer.\u201d\nA necessary evil\nDespite the underutilization of data centers, China\u2019s central government is still throwing its weight behind a push for AI infrastructure. In early 2025, it convened an AI industry symposium, emphasizing the importance of self-reliance in this technology.\nMajor Chinese tech companies are taking note, making investments aligning with this national priority. Alibaba Group announced plans to invest over $50 billion in cloud computing and AI hardware infrastructure over the next three years, while ByteDance plans to invest around $20 billion in GPUs and data centers.\nIn the meantime, companies in the US are doing likewise. Major tech firms including OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle have teamed up to commit to the Stargate initiative, which plans to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years to build advanced data centers and computing infrastructure. Given the AI competition between the two countries, experts say that China is unlikely to scale back its efforts. \u201cIf generative AI is going to be the killer technology, infrastructure is going to be the determinant of success,\u201d says Goodrich, the tech policy advisor to RAND.\n\u201cThe Chinese central government will likely see [underused data centers] as a necessary evil to develop an important capability, a growing pain of sorts. You have the failed projects and distressed assets, and the state will consolidate and clean it up. They see the end, not the means,\u201d Goodrich says.\nDemand remains strong for Nvidia chips, and especially the H20 chip, which was custom-designed for the Chinese market. One industry source, who requested not to be identified under his company policy, confirmed that the H20, a lighter, faster model optimized for AI inference, is currently the most popular Nvidia chip, followed by the H100, which continues to flow steadily into China even though sales are officially restricted by US sanctions. Some of the new demand is driven by companies deploying their own versions of DeepSeek\u2019s open-source models.\nFor now, many data centers in China sit in limbo\u2014built for a future that has yet to arrive. Whether they will find a second life remains uncertain. For Fang Cunbao, DeepSeek\u2019s success has become a moment of reckoning, casting doubt on the assumption that an endless expansion of AI infrastructure guarantees progress.\nThat\u2019s just a myth, he now realizes. At the start of this year, Fang decided to quit the data center industry altogether. \u201cThe market is too chaotic. The early adopters profited, but now it\u2019s just people chasing policy loopholes,\u201d he says. He\u2019s decided to go into AI education next.\n\u201cWhat stands between now and a future where AI is actually everywhere,\u201d he says, \u201cis not infrastructure anymore, but solid plans to deploy the technology.\u201d\nDeep Dive\nArtificial intelligence\nIn a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses\nIt\u2019s the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "Will we ever trust robots?\nIf most robots still need remote human operators to be safe and effective, why should we welcome them into our homes?\nThe world might seem to be on the brink of a humanoid-robot heyday. New breakthroughs in artificial intelligence promise the type of capable, general-purpose robots previously seen only in science fiction\u2014robots that can do things like assemble cars, care for patients, or tidy our homes, all without being given specialized instructions.\nIt\u2019s an idea that has attracted an enormous amount of attention, capital, and optimism. Figure raised $675 million for its humanoid robot in 2024, less than two years after being founded. At a Tesla event this past October, the company\u2019s Optimus robots outshined the self-driving taxi that was meant to be the star of the show. Tesla\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, believes that these robots could somehow build \u201ca future where there is no poverty.\u201d\nOne might think that supremely capable humanoids are just a few years away from populating our homes, war zones, workplaces, borders, schools, and hospitals to serve roles as varied as therapists, carpenters, home health aides, and soldiers.\nYet recent progress has arguably been more about style than substance. Advancements in AI have undoubtedly made robots easier to train, but they have yet to enable them to truly sense their surroundings, \u201cthink\u201d of what to do next, and carry out those decisions in the way some viral videos might imply. In many of these demonstrations (including Tesla\u2019s), when a robot is pouring a drink or wiping down a counter, it is not acting autonomously, even if it appears to be. Instead, it is being controlled remotely by human operators, a technique roboticists refer to as teleoperation. The futuristic looks of such humanoids, which usually borrow from dystopian Hollywood sci-fi tropes like screens for faces, sharp eyes, and towering, metallic forms, suggest the robots are more capable than they often are.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that we\u2019re at peak hype,\u201d says Leila Takayama, a robotics expert and vice president of design and human-robot interaction at the warehouse robotics company Robust AI. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an arms war\u2014or humanoids war\u2014between all the big tech companies to flex and show that they can do more and they can do better.\u201d As a result, she says, any roboticist not working on a humanoid has to answer to investors as to why. \u201cWe have to talk about them now, and we didn\u2019t have to a year ago,\u201d Takayama told me.\nShariq Hashme, a former employee of both OpenAI and Scale AI, entered his robotics firm Prosper into this arms race in 2021. The company is developing a humanoid robot it calls Alfie to perform domestic tasks in homes, hospitals, and hotels. Prosper hopes to manufacture and sell Alfies for approximately $10,000 to $15,000 each.\n\u201cWhy are we enamored with this idea of building a replica of ourselves?\u201d\nGuy Hoffman, associate professor, Cornell University\nIn conceiving the design for Alfie, Hashme identified trustworthiness as the factor that should trump all other considerations, and the top challenge that needs to be overcome to see humanoids benefit society. Hashme believes one essential tactic to get people to put their trust in Alfie is to build a detailed character from the ground up\u2014something humanlike but not too human.\nThis is about more than just Alfie\u2019s appearance. Hashme and his colleagues are envisioning the way the robot moves and signals what he\u2019ll do next; imagining desires and flaws that shape his approach to tasks; and crafting an internal code of ethics that governs the instructions he will and will not accept from his owners.\nIn some ways, leaning so heavily on the principle of trustworthiness for Alfie feels premature; Prosper has raised a tiny amount of capital compared with giants like Tesla or Figure and is months (or years) away from shipping a product. But the need to tackle the issue of trustworthiness head-on and early reflects the messy moment humanoids are in: Despite all the investment and research, few people would feel warm and comfortable with such a robot if it walked into their living room right now. We\u2019d wonder what data it was recording about us and our surroundings, fear it might someday take our job, or be turned off by its way of moving; rather than elegant and useful, humanoids are often cumbersome and creepy. Overcoming that lack of trust will be the first hurdle to clear before humanoids can live up to their hype.\nBut on the road to helping Alfie win our trust, one question looms larger than any other: How much will he be able to do on his own? How much will he still rely on humans?\nNew AI techniques have made it faster to train robots through demonstration data\u2014usually some combination of images, videos, and other data created by humans doing tasks like washing dishes while wearing sensors that pick up on their movements. This data can then coach robots through those tasks much the way that a large body of text can help a large language model create sentences. Still, this method requires lots of data, and lots of humans need to step in and correct for errors.\nHashme told me that he expects the first release of Alfie to handle only about 20% of tasks on his own. The rest will be assisted by a Prosper team of \u201cremote assistants,\u201d at least some of them based in the Philippines, who will have the ability to remotely control Alfie\u2019s movements. When I raised, among other concerns, whether it\u2019s viable for a robotics business to rely on manual human labor for so many tasks, Hashme pointed to the successes of Scale AI. That company, which processes training data for AI applications, has a significant workforce in the Philippines\u2014and is often criticized for its labor practices. Hashme was one of the people managing that workforce for about a year before founding Prosper. His departure from Scale AI was itself set off by a violation of trust\u2014one for which he would serve time in federal prison.\nThe success or failure of Alfie will reveal much about society\u2019s willingness to welcome humanoid robots into our private spaces. Can we accept a profoundly new and asymmetric labor arrangement in which workers in low-wage countries use robotic interfaces to perform physical tasks for us at home? Will we trust them to safeguard private data and images of us and our families? On the most basic level, will the robots even be useful?\nTo address some of these concerns around trust, Hashme brought in Buck Lewis. Two decades before Lewis worked with robots, before he was charged with designing a humanoid that people would trust rather than fear, the challenge in front of him was a rat.\nIn 2001, Lewis was a revered animator and one of the top minds at Pixar. His specialty was designing characters with deep, universal appeal, a top concern to studios that fund high-budget projects aimed at capturing audiences worldwide. It was a niche that had led Lewis to bring trucks and sedans to life in the movie Cars and create characters for many DreamWorks and Disney films.\nBut when Jan Pinkava, the creative force behind Ratatouille, told Lewis about his pitch for that film\u2014the story of a rat who wants to be a chef\u2014the task felt insurmountable. Rats evoke such fear and apprehension in humans that their very name has become a shorthand for someone who cannot be trusted. How could Lewis turn a maligned rodent into an endearing chef? \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply ingrained aversion, because rats are horrifying,\u201d he told me. \u201cFor this to work, we had to create a character that rewires people\u2019s perceptions.\u201d\nTo do that, Lewis spent a lot of time in his head, imagining scenes like a group of rats hosting a playful pop-up dinner on a sidewalk in Paris. The result was Remy, a Parisian rat who not only rose through the culinary ranks in Ratatouille but was so lovable that demand for pet rats surged globally after the film\u2019s release in 2007.\nTwo decades later, Lewis has made a career change and is now in charge of crafting every aspect of Alfie\u2019s character at Prosper. Much as the appealing Remy rebranded rats, Alfie represents Lewis\u2019s attempt to change the image of humanoid robots, from futuristic and dangerous to helpful and trustworthy.\nProsper\u2019s approach reflects a foundational robotics concept articulated by Rodney Brooks, a founder of iRobot, which created the Roomba: \u201cThe visual appearance of a robot makes a promise about what it can do and how smart it is. It needs to deliver or slightly overdeliver on that promise or it will not be accepted.\u201d\nAccording to this principle, any humanoid robot makes the promise that it can behave like a human\u2014which is an exceedingly high bar. So high, in fact, that some firms reject it. Some humanoid-skeptic roboticists doubt that a helpful robot needs to resemble a human at all when it could instead accomplish practical tasks without being anthropomorphized.\n\u201cWhy are we enamored with this idea of building a replica of ourselves?\u201d asks Guy Hoffman, a roboticist focused on human-robot interactions and an associate professor at Cornell University\u2019s engineering school.\nThe chief argument for robots with human characteristics is a functional one: Our homes and workplaces were built by and for humans, so a robot with a humanlike form will navigate them more easily. But Hoffman believes there\u2019s another reason: \u201cThrough this kind of humanoid design, we are selling a story about this robot that it is in some way equivalent to us or to the things that we can do.\u201d In other words, build a robot that looks like a human, and people will assume it\u2019s as capable as one.\nIn designing Alfie\u2019s physical appearance, Prosper has borrowed some aspects of typical humanoid design but rejected others. Alfie has wheels instead of legs, for example, as bipedal robots are currently less stable in home environments, but he does have arms and a head. The robot will be built on a vertical column that resembles a torso; his specific height and weight are not yet public. He will have two emergency stop buttons.\nNothing about Alfie\u2019s design will attempt to obscure the fact that he is a robot, Lewis says. \u201cThe antithesis [of trustworthiness] would be designing a robot that\u2019s intended to emulate a human \u2026 and its measure of success is based on how well it has deceived you,\u201d he told me. \u201cLike, \u2018Wow, I was talking to that thing for five minutes and I didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s a robot.\u2019 That, to me, is dishonest.\u201d\nBut much other humanoid innovation is headed in a direction where deception seems to be an increasingly attractive concept. In 2023, several ultrarealistic humanoid robots appeared in the crowd at an NFL game at SoFi stadium in California; after a video of them went viral, Disney revealed they were actually just people in suits, a stunt to promote a movie. Nine months later, researchers from the University of Tokyo unveiled a way to attach engineered skin, which used human cells, over the face of a robot in an attempt to more perfectly resemble a human face.\n\u201cThrough this kind of humanoid design, we are selling a story [that this robot] is in some way equivalent to us or to the things that we can do.\u201d\nGuy Hoffman, roboticist\nLewis has considered much more than just Alfie\u2019s appearance. He and Prosper envision Alfie as an ambassador from a future civilization in which robots have incorporated the best qualities of humanity. He\u2019s not young or old but has the wisdom of middle age, and his primary function in life is to be of service to people on their terms. Like any compelling character, Alfie has flaws people can relate to\u2014he wishes he could be faster, and he tends to be a bit obsessive about finishing the tasks asked of him. Core tenets of Alfie\u2019s service are to respect boundaries, to be discreet and nonjudgmental, and to earn trust.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an entity that\u2019s nonhuman, but he has a sort of sentience,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to avoid looking at it as directly comparable to human consciousness.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been referring to Alfie as \u201che\u201d\u2014at the risk of over-anthropomorphizing what is currently a robot in development\u2014because Lewis pictures him as a gendered male. When I asked why he pictures Alfie as having a gender, he said it\u2019s probably a relic from the archetypal male butlers he saw on television shows like Batman growing up. But in a conversation with Hashme, I learned there is actually a real-life butler who is in some ways serving as an inspiration for Alfie.\nThat would be Fitzgerald Heslop. Heslop has decades of experience in high-end hospitality training, and for seven years he was the only person within the United States Department of Defense qualified to train household managers who would run the homes of three- and four-star generals. Heslop now runs the household of a wealthy family in the Middle East (he declined to get more specific) and has been contracted by Prosper to inform Alfie\u2019s approach to service within the home.\nShortly into my conversation with Heslop, he elaborated on what excellent service looks like. \u201cThat\u2019s the level of creativity the good butler deals in: the making of beautiful moments to put people at their ease and increase their pleasure,\u201d he said, quoting Steven M. Ferry\u2019s book Butlers & Household Managers: 21st Century Professionals. He spoke with conviction about the impact great service can have on the world and about how protocol and etiquette can level the egos of even top dignitaries. Citing a quote often attributed to Mahatma Gandhi, he said, \u201cThe best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\u201d\nThough he has no experience in robotics, Heslop is drawn to the idea that household robots could someday provide impeccable levels of service, and he thinks that Prosper has identified the right priorities to get there. \u201cPrivacy and discretion, attention to detail, and meticulous eyes for that are mission critical to the overall objective of the company,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd more importantly, in this case, Alfie.\u201d\nIt is one thing to dream up an Alfie in sketchbooks, and another to build him. In the real world, the first version of Alfie will depend on remote assistants, mostly working abroad, to handle approximately 80% of its household tasks. These assistants will use interfaces not unlike video-game controllers to control Alfie\u2019s movements, relying on data from his sensors and cameras to guide them in washing dishes or clearing a table.\nHashme says efforts are being made to conceal or anonymize personally revealing data while the robot is being teleoperated. That will include steps like removing sensitive objects and people\u2019s faces from recordings and allowing users to delete any footage they like. Ideally, Hashme wrote in an email, Alfie \u201cwill often simply look away from any potentially private activities.\u201d\nThe AI industry has an appalling track record when it comes to workers in low-wage countries performing the hidden labor required to build cutting-edge models. Workers in Kenya were reportedly paid less than $2 an hour to manually purge toxic training data, including content describing child sexual abuse and torture, for OpenAI. Scale AI\u2019s own operation in the Philippines, which Hashme helped manage, was criticized in 2023 by rights groups for not abiding by basic labor standards and failing to pay workers properly and on time, according to an investigation by the Washington Post.\nIn a statement, OpenAI said such work \u201cneeds to be done humanely and willingly,\u201d and that the company establishes \u201cethical and wellness standards for our data annotators.\u201d In a response to questions about criticisms of its operation in the Philippines, Scale AI wrote, \u201cOver the past year alone, we\u2019ve paid out hundreds of millions in earnings to contributors, giving people flexible work options and economic opportunity,\u201d and that \u201c98% of support tickets regarding pay have been successfully resolved.\u201d\nHashme says he was not aware of the allegations against Scale AI during his time there, which ended in 2019. But, he said in an email, \u201cwe did make mistakes, which we quickly corrected and generally took quite seriously.\u201d I asked him what lessons he takes from the allegations against Scale AI and other companies outsourcing sensitive data work and what safeguards he\u2019s putting in place for the team he\u2019s building in the Philippines for Prosper, which so far numbers about 10 people.\n\u201cA lot of companies that do that kind of stuff end up doing it in a way which is kind of shitty for the people who are being employed,\u201d Hashme told me. Such companies often outsource important HR activities to untrustworthy partners abroad or lose workers\u2019 trust through bad incentive programs, he said, adding: \u201cWith a more experienced and closely managed team, and a lot more transparency around the entire system, I expect we\u2019ll be able to do a much better job.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth disclosing the nature of Hashme\u2019s departure from Scale AI, where he was hired in 2017 as its 14th employee. In May 2019, according to court documents, Scale noticed that someone had repeatedly withdrawn unauthorized payments of $140 and transferred them to multiple PayPal accounts. The company contacted the FBI. Over the course of five months, approximately $56,000 was taken from the company. An investigation revealed that Hashme, then 26, was behind the withdrawals, and in October of that year, he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud. Ahead of his sentencing, Alexandr Wang, the now-billionaire founder and CEO of Scale AI, wrote a letter to the judge in support of Hashme, as did 13 other current or former Scale employees. \u201cI believe Shariq is genuinely remorseful for his crime, and I have no reason to believe he will ever do something like this again,\u201d Wang wrote, and he said the company would not have wanted the wrongdoer prosecuted if it had known it was Hashme.\nHashme lost his job, his stock options, and Scale\u2019s sponsorship of his green card application. Scale offered him a $10,000 severance payment before leaving, which he declined to accept, according to Wang\u2019s letter. Hashme paid the money back in 2019, and in February 2020, he was sentenced to three months in federal prison, which he served. Wang is now a primary investor in Prosper Robotics, alongside Ben Mann (cofounder of Anthropic), Simon Last (cofounder of Notion), and Debo Olaosebikan (cofounder and CEO of Kepler Computing).\n\u201cI had a major lapse in judgment when I was younger. I was facing some personal challenges and stole from my employer. The consequences and the realization of what I\u2019d done came as a shock, and led to a lot of soul-searching,\u201d Hashme wrote in an email in response to questions about the crime. At Prosper, he wrote, \u201cwe\u2019re taking trustworthiness as our highest aspiration.\u201d\nThere are some real upsides to being able to control robots remotely, but the idea of large-scale robotic teleoperation by overseas workers, even if it takes years for it to be effective, would be nothing short of a seismic shift for labor. It would present the possibility that even highly localized physical work that we perceive as immune to moving offshore\u2014cleaning hotel rooms or caring for hospital patients\u2014might someday be conducted by workers abroad. It also seems antithetical to the very idea of a trustworthy robot, since the machine\u2019s effectiveness would be inextricably tied to a faceless worker in another country, most likely receiving paltry wages.\nHashme has spoken about using a portion of Prosper\u2019s profits to make direct payments to people whose jobs have been affected or replaced by Alfies, but he doesn\u2019t have specifics on how that would work. He\u2019s also still thinking through issues related to who or what Prosper\u2019s customers should be trusting when they allow its robot into their home.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want you to have to place as much trust in the company or the people the company hires,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d rather you place trust in the device, and the device is the robot, and the robot is making sure the company doesn\u2019t do something they\u2019re not supposed to do.\u201d\nHe admits that the first version of Alfie will likely not live up to his highest aspirations, but he remains steadfast that the robot can be of service to society and to people, if only they can trust him.\nDeep Dive\nCulture\nWhen tech gets religion: How churches use data and AI\nSpiritual care and technology are converging across the country, reshaping the theology of trust.\nApple AirPods : a gateway hearing aid\nThe hearing aid features first available on Apple's AirPods Pro 2 are a good start to democratizing a crucial technology.\nOn the ground in Ukraine\u2019s largest Starlink repair shop\nElon Musk's satellite internet service has been absolutely critical to the country's defense.

      "text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\nBlood runs through every human body. And yet there\u2019s still not enough of it. For one, not enough people are donating it. But it\u2019s also really hard to store, and it takes very special conditions to keep it healthy.\nBut there\u2019s a potential solution: an artificial version that wouldn\u2019t need to be treated quite as gently or refrigerated. The Department of Defense recently granted $46 million to the group responsible for the development of a synthetic blood called ErythroMer.\n\u201cIf this synthetic blood substitute works, it could be absolutely game-changing because it can be freeze-dried, it can be reconstituted on demand, and it\u2019s universal,\u201d journalist Nicola Twilley says. It would save many lives: As she reported for the New Yorker, 30,000 preventable deaths occur each year because people didn\u2019t get blood in time.\nOn a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Twilley about the bleeding edge of artificial blood research and why we need more blood in the first place. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nMary Harris: Can you give some historical context to our understanding of blood?\nNicola Twilley: It took a long time for people to figure out what it was, but even before that, everyone thought of it as special. You can see that in everything from religion: blood sacrifices to gods or Jesus Christ\u2019s sacrifice of his own blood to save humanity. It\u2019s a very important symbolic liquid. And it always has been. Virgil calls it the \u201cpurple soul.\u201d There was this sense that if you were blood brothers, if you swore a blood oath, somehow that\u2019s more serious than anything else. Even before we had a clue that blood is essential to sustain life, there was this sense that it represented the very essence of a person.\nNow that we do know about blood, it seems even more magical. It\u2019s more like an organ than a liquid. Can you explain that?\nA lot of people think of blood as a bodily fluid, like sweat or urine. And it\u2019s not. It\u2019s alive. It has all these functions in keeping you alive. The most obvious one is picking up oxygen in the lungs and releasing it throughout the body. But it\u2019s also delivering nutrients. It\u2019s transporting hormones. It\u2019s getting rid of waste products. It regulates body temperature and overall fluid balance. It\u2019s monitoring organ damage and inflammation. And it\u2019s the mechanism behind how tissues can get swollen.\nYou tell that story in your piece about how, back in the \u201990s, there was an effort to test artificial blood. It got really far, and then it failed very dramatically. Can you explain what happened there?\nThere was a big chunk of time in the early years of the AIDS crisis when there wasn\u2019t a test for HIV, and so the entire blood supply was potentially contaminated. That really lit a fire under the artificial blood researchers. The thing that carries oxygen in blood is a molecule called hemoglobin. It\u2019s what makes blood red and very iron-rich. It picks up oxygen in the lungs, ferries it around, and releases it in the body. The researchers thought: Why don\u2019t we just isolate hemoglobin and we\u2019ll put that into people, inject it into their bloodstream, and it can carry oxygen around. Why fuss with all the rest of the blood when we can just isolate hemoglobin and get it to do the job? And several major pharmaceutical companies developed products that did this. They got to Phase 3 clinical trials, which is when you\u2019re injecting it into people who have suffered trauma. That\u2019s the final hurdle before Food and Drug Administration approval. And those trials failed. People died.\nTell me a bit about the synthetic blood, ErythroMer, and what the charmingly named co-inventor Allan Doctor is doing.\nHe\u2019s been working on it for more than a decade. The research got a huge boost recently when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency gave a $46 million grant to move this forward. He\u2019s combining ErythroMer (a synthetic red blood cell) with a synthetic platelet that\u2019s being developed at the University of Pittsburgh with freeze-dried plasma. It\u2019s a little cocktail, and it\u2019s going to be pretty close to whole blood, but magically universal and freeze-dryable. And Dr. Doctor\u2019s red blood cell particle is actually slightly more effective than a human red blood cell at releasing oxygen.\nSo you can get more oxygen to your cells?\nExactly. Get a little bit more bang for your buck. He is currently testing this in animals, specifically rabbits. He drains half the blood out of these rabbits, which sounds terrible, but actually, it\u2019s the most humane setup you can have. He replaces that lost half of their blood with his cocktail. It\u2019s kind of astonishing to watch, because the rabbit that has lost half its blood is not happy. It is struggling to stay alive. That\u2019s a fatal injury. If you do nothing within 10 minutes of having their blood replaced with this cocktail, they\u2019re sniffing. Their ear is twitching. They start hopping around again. It\u2019s sort of astonishing. It looks semi-miraculous.\nHow long does Dr. Doctor think it\u2019s going to take for him to be trying his cocktail in people?\nThere are a lot of hurdles to be cleared. I went and saw a pair of rabbits. But you can\u2019t do science based on one pair of rabbits. You have to do a lot of these trials. When I talked to Dr. Doctor, he\u2019s hesitant, like any good scientist, to say when, but there\u2019s no chance you could do all of that in under seven, eight years, even if you are moving really fast.\nIn theory, couldn\u2019t we just invest a whole lot of money in getting more people to go to the Red Cross and donate blood?\nYou are 100 percent correct. There are two easy things we could do that would actually solve a lot of problems.\nBefore I say what they are, I should back up and say, if you\u2019re on a battlefield, this synthetic nanoparticle is going to be the way to go always. You freeze-dry it and you rehydrate it on the battlefield with drinking water, and that\u2019s it. Right now, in Ukraine, blood is a real crisis because you have to keep it cold. And aerial surveillance drones can see the generator that you\u2019re using to keep it cold, and they will bomb that. So the heat signature of the infrastructure to keep blood even anywhere near the front lines is making hospitals a target. And so they\u2019re not able to have blood. So for military purposes, synthetic freeze-dried blood is the way to go.\nYes, more of us should give blood. But also, we know that even a five-minute delay in giving someone blood reduces their chances of survival. It\u2019s like CPR. You wouldn\u2019t wait to start CPR until you get to the hospital. We all know that you have to start it right away. Same with blood: You should give blood as soon as you can. Right now, in most of the U.S., blood is not given before the hospital because it can\u2019t be reimbursed under our current system.\nBecause it will just go bad at a certain point?\nNo, no, it\u2019s the billing system. It\u2019s the insurance companies. No one will reimburse for blood that is given before you get to the hospital.\nIn your piece, you tell the story of a clinical trial in which they put blood on ambulances and got it to people before the hospital, and it showed a huge improvement in survival. Then, as soon as the clinical trial was over, they had to take it out because there was no way to get it paid for.\nThe surgeons who spoke to me about this called it criminal. And I think they\u2019re right. It\u2019s really wrong that we know how to save lives already and we aren\u2019t doing it because it\u2019s not reimbursable.\nIt strikes me as deeply ironic that we already have these solutions that could save lots and lots of lives if we simply gave more blood and figured out a way to make insurance companies pay for it on ambulances. We could be saving tens of thousands of lives already before we ever get a synthetic replacement."

      "text": "In \u201cPreventing Nuclear War,\u201d an essay published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, in 1981, the Harvard law professor Roger Fisher imagines a President in the White House, discussing nuclear war. Fisher was involved in the Camp David Accords, served as an adviser to both sides during the Iran hostage crisis, and helped to arrange the 1985 Gorbachev-Reagan summit. Much of his professional life was centered on managing pressured, consequential situations. During the Cold War\u2014and arguably still today\u2014the most consequential situation was the possibility of nuclear war. Fisher, who was a pilot during the Second World War, makes what he describes as a \u201cquite simple\u201d suggestion to reduce the chances of launching a nuclear attack: \u201cPut that needed code number in a little capsule and then implant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer.\u201d Like the rotation of military personnel who today trade off carrying the \u201cnuclear football\u201d\u2014the briefcase that contains the nuclear launch codes\u2014the person with the implanted capsule would be near the President constantly. In Fisher\u2019s scenario, a Navy officer named George does the job. \u201cThe volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife,\u201d Fisher writes. \u201cIf ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. The President says, \u2018George, I\u2019m sorry, but tens of millions must die.\u2019 \u201d That there would be blood on the White House carpet is essential. \u201cHe has to look at someone and realize what death is\u2014what an innocent death is.\u201d The Fisher Protocol, as it was termed, makes vivid the reality that nuclear war, so often spoken of in the bloodless language of tactics and strategy, is unimaginably horrific.\nThat was more than forty years ago. The Fisher Protocol has not been implemented, not even in spirit. The Department of Defense, which is spending $1.5 trillion to replace or modernize our nuclear weapons and infrastructure, describes the logic of nuclear deterrence\u2014have enough nuclear weapons to make others not launch nuclear weapons\u2014as \u201csound.\u201d According to the D.O.D., the presence of \u201cmultiple nuclear competitors\u201d is a reason to develop even more nuclear capabilities. China has more than doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years. Russia, which has spent decades on modernizing its nuclear arsenal, has put into space what the U.S. military assesses as an anti-satellite weapon with nuclear potential\u2014sometimes called a \u201cSput-nuke\u201d\u2014and in November, 2024, Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons. The only remaining nuclear nonproliferation treaty between the U.S. and Russia, the New START treaty, is set to expire in February.\nAs the U.S. weakens its international alliances, non-nuclear countries with nuclear neighbors\u2014South Korea, Germany, and Saudi Arabia, for example\u2014may decide that acquiring such weapons is in their national-security interest. Some experts believe that the recent bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear-weapons development sites will only strengthen the country\u2019s nuclear ambitions. No one has bombed North Korea, after all.\nIn July, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists marked the eightieth anniversary of the Trinity test by helping to organize the Nobel Laureate Assembly for the Prevention of Nuclear War, a gathering of nuclear experts and Nobelists held at the University of Chicago. The assembly put together a declaration that includes pragmatic suggestions for reducing the likelihood of ending civilization, among them that nuclear nations should engage in dialogue; develop back channels of communication; maintain human decision-making and oversight over nuclear control and command; and reaffirm commitment to the Outer Space Treaty, which bans nuclear weapons in space. Like the Trinity test, the Bulletin dates to 1945, and a similar meeting was held that year, also at the University of Chicago. Zachary Rudolph, the deputy director of the university\u2019s Existential Risk Lab, told me that the opening remarks of the 1945 gathering, delivered by the sociologist Edward Shils, were \u201ceerily prophetic.\u201d \u201cMuch about Hiroshima and Nagasaki was not even declassified yet,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cIt was, like, one month after it happened. But what he anticipated then\u2014mutually assured destruction, deterrence, arms races, proliferation\u2014is still what we talk about now.\u201d\nShortly after the conference, I spoke with one of the attendees, Herb Lin, a scholar of technology and national security at Stanford. Lin is seventy-three. He has a doctorate in physics from M.I.T., earned under Philip Morrison\u2014a onetime student of J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s\u2014who worked on the Manhattan Project. Morrison rode out to the Trinity test site in a sedan with the plutonium core of the bomb in a case next to him; he later became a prominent activist for nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. Morrison\u2019s career echoes the arc of many Manhattan Project scientists, who went from believing that only a nuclear weapon could bring peace to believing that only disarmament could bring peace. In 1979, the year Lin finished his Ph.D., a large anti-nuclear protest followed the partial meltdown of one of the reactors at Three Mile Island, and, a few years later, a million people walked from Central Park to the United Nations complex calling for an end to nuclear weapons. Harry Belafonte, Bruce Springsteen, and Joan Baez were among the marchers for what was, back then, a widely held concern. Though the capacity to destroy life as we know it several times over remains, the issue is less present in the public mind now; it was scarcely mentioned in the run-up to the 2024 election.\nI asked Lin why he believes that is the case. \u201cI think the biggest difference between then and now is that we\u2019ve normalized nuclear competition,\u201d he said. A 2017 study led by the political scientist Scott Sagan, of Stanford, and Benjamin Valentino, a professor of government at Dartmouth, asked Americans if they would support the use of an atomic weapon that would kill two million Iranians if twenty thousand American troops were at risk\u2014and the majority said yes. \u201cYou will hear people talk about nuclear war saying, \u2018In this option, only two million people die,\u2019 \u201d Lin said. \u201cThink about that. I\u2019m not saying thirty million isn\u2019t worse than two million, but \u2018only two million,\u2019 when what follows is \u2018die,\u2019 is a completely insane statement.\u201d\nIt has been eighty years since the first\u2014and last\u2014time nuclear weapons were used in war. The Nuclear Matters Handbook of the D.O.D. notes that the policy of deterrence \u201chas done its job,\u201d but there\u2019s also the matter of dumb luck. \u201cOne of the most interesting developments in psychology has been coming to understand that people are systematically irrational,\u201d Lin said. \u201cYet most theories of nuclear deterrence\u201d\u2014they won\u2019t attack us because they know we can attack them\u2014\u201care premised on rational actors.\u201d The roll call of people across the decades who have had access to nuclear weapons includes many who are considerably less rational than the irrational rest of us. \u201cAnd so the whole edifice of deterrence is, from the beginning, in trouble,\u201d Lin said.\nHow nuclear risk is perceived is an area of special interest for Rose McDermott, a political scientist at Brown who also has a degree in experimental social psychology. \u201cBelieving in rational stability is a salve. A way to avoid knowing that we live on the knife\u2019s edge of extinction,\u201d McDermott told me. \u201cIt\u2019s avoiding the truth that there are unsuitable leaders in control of weapons that can destroy humanity.\u201d Neither economic sanctions nor the more than a hundred thousand Russian soldiers who have died in the war on Ukraine appear to have had much of an impact on Putin\u2019s decision-making. \u201cWe can look at history,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cStalin, for example\u2014we know there are certain personality types who are more concerned with their own status than with the well-being of the body politic. We know there are leaders driven by narcissism and paranoia, who can make decisions with very few institutional or operational constraints.\u201d\nSuch leaders are not always beyond our borders. McDermott said, \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be sole authority,\u201d referring to countries, such as ours, that ultimately leave the decision to launch nuclear weapons to one person. In the current protocol, the President can act without congressional or military approval; although the Secretary of Defense is expected to be part of the chain of communication, the secretary does not have a vote. Recently, Trump responded to a tweet by the Russian official Dmitry Medvedev about Russia\u2019s nuclear capabilities by saying that he was sending two nuclear submarines over to \u201cappropriate places.\u201d France also has a sole-authority policy, and it seems reasonable to assume that North Korea does as well; we have limited information on the policies of other nations.\n\u201cAnother thing we\u2019ve learned is that decision-making is a skill,\u201d McDermott said. She talked about how a series of questions can help people make better decisions. \u201cYou actually go through a checklist, rather than do something you absolutely can\u2019t pull back that could destroy an entire country or planet. It would be questions like, \u2018What is your confidence that this incoming attack is real?\u2019 \u2018What are your values?\u2019 \u201d She compared this to the protocols that were introduced in hospitals around twenty years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s those checklists\u2014like making a mark on which knee to operate on, verifying that you\u2019re operating on the right person.\u201d These ideas can seem overly simple, even silly. \u201cBut it turns out that instituting these protocols in hospitals saved more than a hundred thousand lives.\u201d\nSome nuclear-risk situations, however, don\u2019t lend themselves to protocols. During the Cold War, the U.S. operated a radar detector in Greenland. Worried about Soviet disruption, the U.S. routinely flew a B-52 with nuclear bombs on board near Greenland, to report any possible attack. \u201cIn January, 1968, a crew member of the B-52 had stuffed some extra seat cushions near a heating vent, and they caught on fire,\u201d Sagan, the political scientist, told me. The crew parachuted from the plane, which crashed onto the ice and exploded. Luckily, the nuclear bombs didn\u2019t detonate. \u201cI call it \u2018the Problem of the Redundancy Problem,\u2019 \u201d Sagan said. \u201cThat whole logic, of putting a thermonuclear-armed bomber out as part of your warning system\u2014that\u2019s the kind of complexity that I worry about so much.\u201d An increasingly complex system generates its own kind of unforeseeable errors.\nSagan described another major pathway to unintended nuclear catastrophes. The fear of a surprise attack could make a nation consider a pre\u00ebmptive attack, leading to war between two nations that don\u2019t want a war. For this and other reasons, some countries, including China and India, have made what are known as \u201cno first use\u201d vows.\nThere\u2019s the problem of someone deliberately starting a nuclear war, and then there are errors and misinterpretations: a radar that mistakes a moonrise for a Soviet missile launch, as happened in Greenland in 1960; a repair officer\u2019s error that leads to an explosion in a silo housing an ICBM, as happened in Damascus, Arkansas, in 1980; nuclear-warhead-armed missiles that are mistakenly loaded onto an Air Force bomber that is supposed to be carrying dummy missiles, as happened in North Dakota in 2007.\nWhat has saved the day in many false-alarm and other near-miss situations has quite often been simple human relationships. During the Cuban missile crisis, for example, U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy held back-channel meetings with the Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin. \u201cThe process of arms control isn\u2019t only about reducing weapons,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cEven if no agreement is reached, the process of meeting and negotiating needs to be reactivated, so that there\u2019s a conversation, and so that relationships are maintained.\u201d The many recent firings at the Pentagon, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s firing of more than a thousand members of the State Department, means less personal continuity in relations between the U.S. and the rest of the world.\nIn his 1981 essay, Fisher identified other human factors that make the world more perilous, among them the desire to win, a phrase that he puts in quotes and which he characterizes as a concept that makes more sense for a game of football than for one of nuclear football. \u201cWe want victory; we want power; we want peace. Exploding nuclear weapons will not help us achieve any one of them,\u201d he writes.\nFisher had friends at the Pentagon to whom he presented his idea about the nuclear codes, the surgically embedded capsule, the butcher knife, the blood stains on the White House carpet. According to Fisher, his friends reacted with tremendous concern, saying, \u201cMy God, that\u2019s terrible.\u201d Having to kill someone would affect the President\u2019s judgment, they pointed out. They saw that as a big problem: \u201cHe might never push the button.\u201d \u2666"

But coal is still booming in other parts of the world, especially in some larger countries where electricity demand is growing quickly.\nA tale of two coal declines\nThe power plant, scheduled to shut down at midnight on September 30, is called Ratcliffe-on-Soar, and it's the last bastion of coal in the UK, where the fuel has a rich history. The country relied on coal for over 100 years, and until 1990, it made up the lion\u2019s share of electricity generated there.\nSince then, the UK has seen two major waves of cutting down coal. The first came in the 1990s, when coal went from around 65% of electricity supply to roughly 35%, and there was a series of mine closures across the country. Coal was largely replaced by natural gas, which was becoming more widely available and beat out coal on economics, says Joel Jaeger, a senior research associate at the World Resources Institute.\nThen, roughly a decade ago, came a second wave of coal retirements. This time it was driven in part by policy: The European Union (which the UK belonged to at the time) had set a price on carbon, and the UK implemented an even higher one in 2013. That made coal even less economical an option, Jaeger says. In the 2010s, renewables (mostly wind and bioenergy) were quickly ramped up to replace most of the remaining coal infrastructure.\nOf the countries that have phased out coal the fastest, the UK has made the most impressive transformation, Jaeger says, since the country has totally wiped it from the grid. Others with speedy transformations include Portugal, which reached zero coal in late 2021, and Greece, where coal went from supplying over half the electricity in 2014 to less than 10% as of 2023. Denmark has also quickly ramped down the fuel and, unlike other countries with quick transitions, replaced it almost entirely with renewables rather than natural gas.\nA natural transition\nThe US is the largest nation among those that have moved away from coal the fastest, Jaeger says. It\u2019s been more of a steady change than what happened in the UK\u2014coal has dropped from contributing over 50% of electricity to 20% over the last four decades.\nMuch of the shift was a response to the growing availability of natural gas in the US\u2014the fracking boom beginning in the mid-2000s made it more domestically accessible and less expensive, Jaeger says. In more recent years, pollution standards for coal plants have slowly tightened and the fleet has aged, he adds, making the plants more expensive to run and causing more of them to be retired.\nMore recently, the US has seen renewables like wind and solar coming onto the grid, and tax credits have helped make them cheaper, pushing more older coal plants to shut down. The US is one of the G7 countries that have agreed to reach zero unabated coal power by 2035.\nGermany has also roughly halved its coal use in the past decade, and it\u2019s replaced the fuel mostly with renewables rather than natural gas. The country has simultaneously been shutting down nuclear power plants, sunsetting the last one in the country in April 2023. Some critics argue that this has slowed the move away from coal.\nWhere coal is still king\nEven as many nations, especially in Europe and North America, move away from coal, the fuel is still booming in other parts of the world. Energy demand globally is increasing, and coal has consistently been the world\u2019s biggest power source, meeting about 35% of demand.\nNowhere shows this trend better than China. While most of the countries mentioned so far (the UK, Germany, the US, Greece, Denmark) have had either steady or decreasing electricity demand since 2005, China\u2019s grid has expanded dramatically.\nTotal Chinese electricity demand was roughly 400 terawatt-hours in 1985. In 2005, it reached 2,500 TWh. As of 2023, it\u2019s 9,500 TWh. The country is basically sprinting to build more power plants to keep up with demand, and much of it is being filled with coal-fired power plants.\nRoughly two-thirds of new coal power plants that came online around the world this year were in China. However, the country is also seeing very quick rises in renewables, including wind and solar power. So even while the use of coal has skyrocketed in the country, the proportion of coal on its grid has ticked down slightly over the past few years.\nIndia is also seeing quick growth of electricity demand, and coal accounted for roughly 75% of that country\u2019s grid as of 2023.\nThe good news is the coal boom could have been a lot worse, Jaeger says. As of 2015 (the year that major nations signed the Paris Agreement, setting a goal to limit warming to roughly 1.5 \u00b0C over preindustrial levels), nearly 1,500 gigawatts\u2019 worth of coal capacity was in development around the world. As of 2023, about half of those planned plants had been canceled or suspended. Roughly 30% went into operation, while the rest are still in development.\nShutting down coal plants is a great way to quickly reduce emissions from the power grid. The problem is, for many of the countries where coal is still growing, moving away from it is going to be harder than it\u2019s been in countries like the UK.\nThe fleet of coal-fired power plants in both China and India is relatively new, so it would be more of a financial loss to phase them out now. Both nations also have booming domestic coal industries, so shifting away could have economic impacts for people there.\nWhile both countries have high and growing emissions today, they\u2019re not the biggest historical contributors to climate change. Europe and the US together have emitted roughly 40% of all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since 1850, meaning those countries have contributed the most to the climate crisis.\nRicher nations that have been able to move away from coal, like the UK, Germany, and the US, may need to support other countries that need to do the same, whether that\u2019s through financial assistance, technology sharing, or other strategies, Jaeger says.\nIf there\u2019s one takeaway from the shutdown of the UK\u2019s final coal plant, he adds, it\u2019s that \u201crapid speeds of transition away from fossil fuels are possible.\u201d\nDeep Dive\nClimate change and energy\nCalifornia is set to become the first US state to manage power outages with AI\nThe software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators.\nChina\u2019s energy dominance in three charts\nThe country is installing solar, building EVs, and investing across energy at a rapid clip.\nThis startup wants to use the Earth as a massive battery\nA recent test shows that Quidnet\u2019s technology can store energy in pressurized water underground for months at a time.\nStay connected\nGet the latest updates from\nMIT Technology Review\nDiscover special offers, top stories, upcoming events, and more."

      "text": "Aid cuts in east Africa have led to cases of babies being born with HIV because mothers could not get medication, a rise in life-threatening infections, and at least one woman having an unwanted abortion, according to interviews with medical staff, patients and experts.\nA report by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) sets out dozens of examples of the impact of disruption to Pepfar \u2013 the president\u2019s emergency plan for aids relief \u2013 in Tanzania and Uganda.\nPepfar, a leading US global health programme, launched in 2003 and is credited with saving millions of lives, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe report is based on interviews with 39 doctors, nurses, people living with HIV, service providers and other experts. It focuses on the first 100 days after Pepfar-funded programmes were instructed to stop work as part of a US government freeze on foreign aid.\nHealth workers reported shortages of drugs to control the virus, resulting in increased serious infections in people living with HIV and children being born with the virus because mothers could not get medication to prevent it being passed on. Clinics have closed, and people are skipping vital doses to eke out their supply of medication, raising the risk of drug-resistance.\nSome programmes have been able to resume activities in the months since the interviews, said Emily Bass, one of the report\u2019s authors, offering \u201ctemporary mitigation\u201d of the harms, but there exists a \u201cnarrow window\u201d for the US Congress to act to secure resources that will stabilise remaining services and prevent the loss of decades of progress.\nThe Trump administration is reportedly refusing to release about half of the $6bn (\u00a34.5bn) funding allocated by Congress for Pepfar in the 2025 fiscal year.\nIn Tanzania and Uganda, HIV prevention and treatment programmes were reliant on Pepfar. The stop work order meant clinics were unable to dispense drugs bought with US money for several days, before a waiver came through allowing treatment to continue.\nEven then, disruption to supply chains meant doctors could not dispense as many drugs as usual, they said, perhaps giving patients supplies for a few weeks rather than months. Rumours spread that normal access was unlikely to return.\nA mental health project research coordinator told PHR: \u201cSomeone did an abortion because of that rumour [that antiretrovirals were no longer available]. She said, \u2018Oh well, I don\u2019t want to have a baby who is HIV positive. I will be blamed myself, so I don\u2019t want.\u2019\u201d\nBy late April, one clinic reported that 25% of the pregnant women living with HIV that it supported had given birth to a child with HIV. Its clinician said drugs had not been delivered and existing stocks would not stretch far enough.\nThe US government waiver allowed HIV prevention programmes to continue only for pregnant or breastfeeding women. It left key at-risk groups unprotected \u2013 in Tanzania and Uganda, LGBTQ+ people, sex workers and people who use drugs face criminalisation and stigma.\nSpecialist services making it easier for them to access care have been hardest hit, the report found, warning of worsening discrimination when those people sought help from mainstream government clinics.\nThe report also found that people\u2019s trust in domestic government, US foreign aid and antiretroviral medications had been damaged. Many said they feared a \u201cdark\u201d future, anticipating increased costs for care and opportunists pushing fake cures.\nThe US government must \u201cimmediately restore, renew, preserve and protect global health funding for essential HIV services, including full funding commensurate with need for global HIV programs in the FY 2026 budget, and subsequently reauthorise the Pepfar program\u201d, the authors concluded, so that there can be \u201ca planned, feasible, and transparent transition to country leadership and ownership of programs\u201d."

      "text": "One day, Mars might become a home to humans. But first, there\u2019s the cinematic, sci-fi challenge of making the Red Planet suitable for life. There\u2019s a problem, though: The typical person can\u2019t get to space safely. That throws a wrench into the whole \u201clet\u2019s move to Mars\u201d plan in the face of extreme climate change and other existential risks on Earth.\nHuman bodies aren\u2019t ready to travel to Mars. Space medicine can help.\nProtecting astronauts in space \u2014 and maybe even Mars \u2014 will help transform health on Earth.\nToday, the path to becoming an astronaut is \u201clittered with the hopes and dreams of medically disqualified candidates,\u201d said Shawna Pandya, a research astronaut with the International Institute for Astronautical Sciences (IIAS) and the director of its Space Medicine Group. \u201cOnce upon a time, kids being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the doctor\u2019s office would be told, \u2018Well, you could still be anything, except an astronaut.\u2019\u201d\nHave space aspirations?\nHere are some of the common reasons why you might be medically disqualified from becoming an astronaut:\n- Tobacco use\n- Autoimmune disorders\n- Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders\n- Sleep apnea\n- Asthma\n- Hypertension\n- Migraines\n- Anxiety and depression\nAstronauts inherently aren\u2019t representative of the broader population \u2014 they\u2019re selected for being in very good health. The stress of existing in essentially weightless microgravity conditions, like those on the International Space Station (ISS), can be incredibly tough on the human body. Astronauts face heightened risks of early-onset osteoporosis, insulin resistance, and significant muscle mass loss. Naturally, government space agencies want people whose bodies are more resilient to such pressures, and who can perform necessary duties without a ton of medical intervention.\nAccording to Haig Aintablian, director of the UCLA Space Medicine Program, \u201cjust as pregnancy causes the body to undergo complex and unique changes, spaceflight also produces distinct and significant physiological changes.\u201d It also requires its own medical specialty to manage (aptly called space medicine).\nThere\u2019s a lot scientists don\u2019t know, from the physical to the psychological. That\u2019s a problem \u2014 for the future of science, space travel, and maybe even human existence at large.\nNASA wants to go to Mars for research, and aims to send humans there as early as the 2030s. As the most similar planet to Earth in our solar system, Mars may have once harbored life, or may even currently. And in the future, we may even need it to support us.\nDecades ago, seriously engaging with the idea of moving to Mars was extremely fringe for a multitude of reasons, ranging from a lack of technical feasibility to the desire to put scientific resources toward solving problems on Earth. Elon Musk \u2014 founder of the spaceflight company SpaceX \u2014 became a famed advocate for colonizing Mars in the early 2000s. He still is. Musk, who is currently worth around $410 billion, claims that he is only accumulating assets for the purpose of Martian space settlement. Last year, he said that he wants 1 million human settlers on the Red Planet in a self-sustaining city by 2050.\nNow Musk isn\u2019t alone. NASA experts, biologists, academics, futurists, disaster resilience researchers, and physicians are seriously considering the possibility of making humanity an interplanetary species.\n\u201cThe biggest problem for humanity to solve is the guaranteed survival of our species \u2014 which the logical answer is to become multiplanetary,\u201d Aintablian said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better solution than Mars.\u201d\nWhile we know some of the health effects of being on the ISS, we can\u2019t really replicate the effects of Martian radiation exposure. Kelly Weinersmith \u2014 a biologist and co-author of A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through? \u2014 thinks that settling Mars on Musk\u2019s timescale will be catastrophic. She argues that we shouldn\u2019t rush to set up shop before understanding \u2014 and mitigating \u2014 the risks, even if this takes centuries rather than decades.\nBut many advocates for settling Mars are much more impatient. The only way to get there safely would be to unlock significant advances in space medicine, a nascent field that has just barely scratched the surface in its approximately 75-year history.\n\u201cNothing that humanity has done that has been worthwhile has been easy,\u201d Aintablian told me. \u201cSo much in our development as a civilization has been difficult, and the reason why we\u2019re able to live such comfortable lives now is because of the extremely difficult challenges that humans have had to solve in the past.\u201d\nWhat we know \u2014 and don\u2019t \u2014 about human health on Mars\nSince extremely few people end up in space right now, the researchers trying to understand how to improve human health there have a limited sample size to work with. Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space in 1961, and more than 600 astronauts have followed him. Only about a sixth of them are women.\nNASA researchers have identified some key ways that time in space can impact human health \u2014 radiation exposures, isolation, distance from Earth, altered gravity, and environmental consequences like an altered immune system. But we\u2019re still lacking many specific examples of how these different dynamics play out in real life.\nOne of the best studies we have is NASA\u2019s famous 2019 twins study. Twin studies allow researchers to separate the effects of genetic predispositions from environmental influences on health outcomes. NASA compared the health of identical twin brothers Scott and Mark Kelly over the course of a year. Scott went into orbit on the ISS while Mark remained on Earth. Both underwent the same battery of physiological tests, and the results indicated some surprising new differences between the two men.\nScott\u2019s telomeres \u2014 the bits of DNA at the end of our chromosomes \u2014 lengthened while he was in space and (mostly) reverted to normal once he returned to Earth, possibly indicating radiation-induced DNA damage and potential increased cancer risk. Scott also lost body mass, developed signs of cardiovascular damage that were not present in Mark, and experienced some short-term cognitive changes after returning to Earth.\nWhile survivable with the right training, equipment, and precautions, the twin study demonstrated how space\u2019s unique environment can have significant consequences for gene expression and overall health while in orbit.\nIf the best of the best struggle, what about the rest of us? We\u2019re getting some insights here now, too.\nSince space tourism has literally taken off, astronauts aren\u2019t the only ones going to space now: Wealthy non-astronauts, like Jeff Bezos, Gayle King, and Katy Perry, have recently taken short, recreational jaunts into outer space through Bezos\u2019s space tech company, Blue Origin.\nAintablian is very excited about the prospect of civilian access to space increasing, which will inherently mean people with medical issues are also flying. This represents a huge opportunity for scientists to study the medical management of a much wider range of conditions.\nThat said, 10 or 15 minutes in space is hardly comparable to the conditions on the ISS. And Mars poses even worse consequences in terms of hostile environments and time spent away from Earth. Mars has toxic dust, lacks plant life and a breathable atmosphere, and only has about 40 percent of Earth\u2019s gravity. Earth\u2019s global magnetic field protects our planet from harmful radiation, and the Martian counterparts are localized, not planet-wide.\nThe longest time someone has been in space consecutively is 438 days aboard a space station. But crewed missions to Mars would probably take at least nine months just to get there, let alone stay or travel back (which could take up to three years). Mars is usually around 140 million miles from Earth based on its orbital path around the sun, with up to a 20-minute communication delay one way. If they experienced a medical emergency, astronauts likely wouldn\u2019t be able to access telemedicine instructions in time, and they couldn\u2019t turn back around for treatment.\nA crewed mission to Mars would have to take all of their supplies with them before they left our planet. And when the first people heading to Mars set foot on the planet, they won\u2019t have access to the intense support astronauts receive when landing back on Earth.\nGetting to Mars is only part of the challenge. We\u2019ve been to space, but so far, humans have only ever sent robots to the Red Planet. We are making educated guesses at what Mars is like for living things. Earth analogues aren\u2019t able to truly replicate the closed, hostile conditions of the space environment, which can wreak havoc on astronauts\u2019 mental health. Desert research stations have an atmosphere, while the moon barely has one \u2014 and setting up that modest base was a huge mission in its own right. Weinersmith told me that scientists at polar research stations are isolated in remote, inhospitable environments, but they can \u201cstill open the door, take a deep breath, and not die.\u201d\nMedicine\u2019s new frontier\nWe\u2019re still pretty far from being able to breathe in Mars\u2019 atmosphere \u2014 but it would be nice to get there one day and simply not die.\nEnter: space medicine.\nPrograms dedicated to figuring out how to get humans safely into space for long periods of time are popping up, and non-physician health care providers are getting in on the action too. UCLA is planning to launch a space nursing program and possibly space paramedic training. SpaceMed is a European master\u2019s program focused on human health in spaceflight and other extreme conditions.\nToday, astronauts receive most of their care from Earth-based aerospace medicine physicians called flight surgeons through telemedicine. Aintablian envisions a future where health care providers directly accompany astronauts on their expedition-class missions, like to the moon or Mars. Artificial intelligence can act as a resource for the on-board flight surgeon, he predicted, and aid in the development of other technologies that will bring us closer to Mars.\nSuch technology is already in the works. Google recently collaborated with NASA to develop an AI system that could guide astronauts in diagnosing and treating medical conditions that arise in-flight when they lack access to telemedicine.\nBut the devil is in the details, Pandya told me. AI can help with just-in-time training for medical emergencies and diagnostics, but the data requirements would be massive. Since extremely few people end up in space \u2014 and the ones who do are overwhelmingly male \u2014 models might be trained on an unrepresentative dataset that could lead to inaccurate predictions of physiological changes in space. These kinks need to be worked out first.\nRight now, there\u2019s a gendered gap in the research \u2014 so much so that Weinersmith told me there\u2019s never a line to the women\u2019s restroom at space settlement conferences. Human reproduction and development in space, as a result, is wildly understudied.\nAs far as we know, no human being has ever been to space while pregnant, and we don\u2019t know of any humans who have been conceived in space. We\u2019re going to learn a lot about reproduction on Earth from the first human space pregnancy and space birth, a prerequisite for a self-sustaining settlement on Mars. (Plus, space tourism companies are talking about hotels in space, and we know what people do in hotels.) Ideally, you want to have an idea of what will happen to someone giving birth in space before they actually go through it.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re arguing is that we should do the research to understand those risks before we go out there because if there are massive risks, there usually are technological solutions for some of these,\u201d Weinersmith said.\nNASA will begin its second Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog this October, a year-long \u201cmission\u201d to Mars in a 3D-printed habitat at Johnson Space Center in Houston, where it will collect behavioral health data on the effects of isolation and confinement. Scientists are conducting bed rest studies, which simulate the physiological effects of altered gravity and weightlessness. And as funding cuts transform the future of scientific research on Earth and beyond, space medicine researchers are among those advocating for continued investment in space and biomedical science.\nMaedeh Mozneb, a biomedical engineer and project scientist in the Sharma Lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told me that the ultimate goal is to send \u201cavatars\u201d of astronauts to space by taking their stem cells and creating 3D tissue cultures called organoids that represent different parts of their body \u2014 yes, miniature hearts, kidneys, and even brains made from Earth-dwelling humans. From there, scientists can determine personalized countermeasures such as workout plans or supplements tailored to each astronaut\u2019s needs, before they actually end up in space.\nThe hope, for those space medicine physicians like Pandya, is that in a spacefaring future, all medical disciplines \u2014 from neurology to radiology \u2014 will be represented in space medicine.\nRed planet, blue planet\nSpace medicine research and practice isn\u2019t cheap. \u201cI often get asked,\u201d said Pandya, \u201c\u2018Why are you spending money on space health when we have all of these problems on Earth?\u2019\u201d But that\u2019s the wrong way to think about it, she said.\nResearch conducted in space has already improved health on this planet. Advances in digital imaging for moon photography during the 1972 Apollo 17 mission later played a crucial role in CT scans and MRIs. Remote health monitoring tools designed for astronauts in space are now widely used in hospitals.\nOne of the next big things in space medicine \u201cis probably going to be the development of radiation protection mechanisms,\u201d Aintablian told me.\nSpace medicine research will also allow more people to go to space. In 2023, Pandya\u2019s team demonstrated the safety and functionality of a continuous glucose monitor in the spaceflight environment. This could eventually allow diabetics to check their blood sugar in space. It has implications for current astronauts, who can develop insulin resistance and pre-diabetes symptoms in longer-duration spaceflights. The child diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes who wants to be an astronaut may actually have the chance to live out their dream now, and studying how the body metabolizes glucose in space helps us better understand health on Earth.\nThen there are the diseases that take decades to unfold. Muscle loss in space can help scientists better understand how to treat conditions like Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy. On Earth, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s often aren\u2019t apparent until a person is in their late 60s.\nIn microgravity, said Shelby Giza, the director of business development at Space Tango, a company that facilitates automated research and development in microgravity conditions, \u201cyou can see that kind of disease output in a matter of weeks.\u201d Research on these conditions can be conducted much faster \u2014 and hopefully accelerate the pace of medical breakthroughs.\nThe same can be said for cancer. Not all radiation exposures are made equal, and susceptibility to the harmful effects of radiation varies between individuals. Since the ISS is within the protection of Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, it\u2019s not the best comparison to the elevated radiation levels astronauts would face on Mars.\nAccording to former NASA astronaut and biologist Kate Rubins, most astronauts are healthy people in their 30s and 40s, an age when cancer typically doesn\u2019t develop. Scientists must track astronauts for decades after their last spaceflight to see if cancer or other adverse health conditions occur. NASA\u2019s Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health program, which is voluntary for former astronauts and not specific to cancer alone, monitors the health status of people like Kelly and Rubins for the rest of their lives.\nExposure to space radiation is linked to developing cancer and degenerative diseases. To mitigate the risk of developing fatal cancers, NASA currently limits astronauts\u2019 spaceflight radiation exposure to 600 millisieverts (mSv) \u2014 roughly the equivalent of 60 CT scans of the torso and pelvis \u2014 over the course of their entire career. A 2023 NASA white paper estimates that a healthy astronaut will have a 33 percent increased risk of dying from cancer in their lifetime after a 1,000-day mission to Mars.\nOne of the next big things in space medicine \u201cis probably going to be the development of radiation protection mechanisms,\u201d Aintablian told me. \u201cI do believe that with the amount of emphasis being placed on radiation protection, we\u2019re going to figure out ways to actually protect against significant amounts of radiation for the general public for multiple uses.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s still relatively early days for the space pharma industry, life science companies are taking note, seeing microgravity as a platform for better drug discovery.\nLike fiber optic cables used for telecommunications, some pharmaceuticals are better synthesized in microgravity conditions. Scientists can produce more uniform protein crystals in microgravity, which can improve drug injectability and reduce the need for refrigeration.\nRaphael Roettgen, an entrepreneur and the co-founder of space biotech startup Prometheus Life Technologies, told me that organoids \u2014 those 3D cell models replicating human organs \u2014 grow more cleanly in space without Earth\u2019s gravity weighing them down. Derived from non-embryonic stem cells, these miniature organ models have tremendous potential for personalized medicine.\nRoettgen hopes that human space organoids could reduce the need for animal testing in the near term. Eventually, he hopes that new organs could be regenerated for patients needing transplants. Since the new tissue would be derived from the patient\u2019s own stem cells, there would not be a risk of immune rejection, saving transplant patients astronomical costs and immense suffering. He estimates that liver regeneration and transplants from these organoids could become a reality in patients within the next 20 years.\nMicrogravity is an \u201cexpensive tool,\u201d but an important one nonetheless, said Mozneb, who studies the effects of low earth orbit on stem cell differentiation. She hopes increasing commercialization and new technologies will significantly decrease the cost of launching experiments into orbit over the next 10 years.\nWhat we already know about space medicine is a drop in the ocean of what we will discover as more people \u2014 astronauts and otherwise \u2014 venture into space.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if you were studying genetics back in the \u201990s,\u201d Mozneb said. \u201cEverything is a discovery.\u201d\nMost Popular\n- Exclusive: RFK Jr. and the White House buried a major study on alcohol and cancer.

      "text": "China built hundreds of AI data centers to catch the AI boom. Now many stand unused.\nThe country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.\nA year or so ago, Xiao Li was seeing floods of Nvidia chip deals on WeChat. A real estate contractor turned data center project manager, he had pivoted to AI infrastructure in 2023, drawn by the promise of China\u2019s AI craze.\nAt that time, traders in his circle bragged about securing shipments of high-performing Nvidia GPUs that were subject to US export restrictions. Many were smuggled through overseas channels to Shenzhen. At the height of the demand, a single Nvidia H100 chip, a kind that is essential to training AI models, could sell for up to 200,000 yuan ($28,000) on the black market.\nNow, his WeChat feed and industry group chats tell a different story. Traders are more discreet in their dealings, and prices have come back down to earth. Meanwhile, two data center projects Li is familiar with are struggling to secure further funding from investors who anticipate poor returns, forcing project leads to sell off surplus GPUs. \u201cIt seems like everyone is selling, but few are buying,\u201d he says.\nJust months ago, a boom in data center construction was at its height, fueled by both government and private investors. However, many newly built facilities are now sitting empty. According to people on the ground who spoke to MIT Technology Review\u2014including contractors, an executive at a GPU server company, and project managers\u2014most of the companies running these data centers are struggling to stay afloat. The local Chinese outlets Jiazi Guangnian and 36Kr report that up to 80% of China\u2019s newly built computing resources remain unused.\nRenting out GPUs to companies that need them for training AI models\u2014the main business model for the new wave of data centers\u2014was once seen as a sure bet. But with the rise of DeepSeek and a sudden change in the economics around AI, the industry is faltering.\n\u201cThe growing pain China\u2019s AI industry is going through is largely a result of inexperienced players\u2014corporations and local governments\u2014jumping on the hype train, building facilities that aren\u2019t optimal for today\u2019s need,\u201d says Jimmy Goodrich, senior advisor for technology to the RAND Corporation.\nThe upshot is that projects are failing, energy is being wasted, and data centers have become \u201cdistressed assets\u201d whose investors are keen to unload them at below-market rates. The situation may eventually prompt government intervention, he says: \u201cThe Chinese government is likely to step in, take over, and hand them off to more capable operators.\u201d\nA chaotic building boom\nWhen ChatGPT exploded onto the scene in late 2022, the response in China was swift. The central government designated AI infrastructure as a national priority, urging local governments to accelerate the development of so-called smart computing centers\u2014a term coined to describe AI-focused data centers.\nIn 2023 and 2024, over 500 new data center projects were announced everywhere from Inner Mongolia to Guangdong, according to KZ Consulting, a market research firm. According to the China Communications Industry Association Data Center Committee, a state-affiliated industry association, at least 150 of the newly built data centers were finished and running by the end of 2024. State-owned enterprises, publicly traded firms, and state-affiliated funds lined up to invest in them, hoping to position themselves as AI front-runners. Local governments heavily promoted them in the hope they\u2019d stimulate the economy and establish their region as a key AI hub.\nHowever, as these costly construction projects continue, the Chinese frenzy over large language models is losing momentum. In 2024 alone, over 144 companies registered with the Cyberspace Administration of China\u2014the country's central internet regulator\u2014to develop their own LLMs. Yet according to the Economic Observer, a Chinese publication, only about 10% of those companies were still actively investing in large-scale model training by the end of the year.\nChina\u2019s political system is highly centralized, with local government officials typically moving up the ranks through regional appointments. As a result, many local leaders prioritize short-term economic projects that demonstrate quick results\u2014often to gain favor with higher-ups\u2014rather than long-term development. Large, high-profile infrastructure projects have long been a tool for local officials to boost their political careers.\nThe post-pandemic economic downturn only intensified this dynamic. With China\u2019s real estate sector\u2014once the backbone of local economies\u2014slumping for the first time in decades, officials scrambled to find alternative growth drivers. In the meantime, the country\u2019s once high-flying internet industry was also entering a period of stagnation. In this vacuum, AI infrastructure became the new stimulus of choice.\n\u201cAI felt like a shot of adrenaline,\u201d says Li. \u201cA lot of money that used to flow into real estate is now going into AI data centers.\u201d\nBy 2023, major corporations\u2014many of them with little prior experience in AI\u2014began partnering with local governments to capitalize on the trend. Some saw AI infrastructure as a way to justify business expansion or boost stock prices, says Fang Cunbao, a data center project manager based in Beijing. Among them were companies like Lotus, an MSG manufacturer, and Jinlun Technology, a textile firm\u2014hardly the names one would associate with cutting-edge AI technology.\nThis gold-rush approach meant that the push to build AI data centers was largely driven from the top down, often with little regard for actual demand or technical feasibility, say Fang, Li, and multiple on-the-ground sources, who asked to speak anonymously for fear of political repercussions. Many projects were led by executives and investors with limited expertise in AI infrastructure, they say. In the rush to keep up, many were constructed hastily and fell short of industry standards.\n\u201cPutting all these large clusters of chips together is a very difficult exercise, and there are very few companies or individuals who know how to do it at scale,\u201d says Goodrich. \u201cThis is all really state-of-the-art computer engineering. I\u2019d be surprised if most of these smaller players know how to do it. A lot of the freshly built data centers are quickly strung together and don\u2019t offer the stability that a company like DeepSeek would want.\u201d\nTo make matters worse, project leaders often relied on middlemen and brokers\u2014some of whom exaggerated demand forecasts or manipulated procurement processes to pocket government subsidies, sources say.\nBy the end of 2024, the excitement that once surrounded China\u2019s data center boom was curdling into disappointment. The reason is simple: GPU rental is no longer a particularly lucrative business.\nThe DeepSeek reckoning\nThe business model of data centers is in theory straightforward: They make money by renting out GPU clusters to companies that need computing capacity for AI training. In reality, however, securing clients is proving difficult. Only a few top tech companies in China are now drawing heavily on computing power to train their AI models. Many smaller players have been giving up on pretraining their models or otherwise shifting their strategy since the rise of DeepSeek, which broke the internet with R1, its open-source reasoning model that matches the performance of ChatGPT o1 but was built at a fraction of its cost.\n\u201cDeepSeek is a moment of reckoning for the Chinese AI industry. The burning question shifted from \u2018Who can make the best large language model?\u2019 to \u2018Who can use them better?\u2019\u201d says Hancheng Cao, an assistant professor of information systems at Emory University.\nThe rise of reasoning models like DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT o1 and o3 has also changed what businesses want from a data center. With this technology, most of the computing needs come from conducting step-by-step logical deductions in response to users\u2019 queries, not from the process of training and creating the model in the first place. This reasoning process often yields better results but takes significantly more time. As a result, hardware with low latency (the time it takes for data to pass from one point on a network to another) is paramount. Data centers need to be located near major tech hubs to minimize transmission delays and ensure access to highly skilled operations and maintenance staff.\nThis change means many data centers built in central, western, and rural China\u2014where electricity and land are cheaper\u2014are losing their allure to AI companies. In Zhengzhou, a city in Li\u2019s home province of Henan, a newly built data center is even distributing free computing vouchers to local tech firms but still struggles to attract clients.\nAdditionally, a lot of the new data centers that have sprung up in recent years were optimized for pretraining workloads\u2014large, sustained computations run on massive data sets\u2014rather than for inference, the process of running trained reasoning models to respond to user inputs in real time. Inference-friendly hardware differs from what\u2019s traditionally used for large-scale AI training.\nGPUs like Nvidia H100 and A100 are designed for massive data processing, prioritizing speed and memory capacity. But as AI moves toward real-time reasoning, the industry seeks chips that are more efficient, responsive, and cost-effective. Even a minor miscalculation in infrastructure needs can render a data center suboptimal for the tasks clients require.\nIn these circumstances, the GPU rental price has dropped to an all-time low. A recent report from the Chinese media outlet Zhineng Yongxian said that an Nvidia H100 server configured with eight GPUs now rents for 75,000 yuan per month, down from highs of around 180,000. Some data centers would rather leave their facilities sitting empty than run the risk of losing even more money because they are so costly to run, says Fan: \u201cThe revenue from having a tiny part of the data center running simply wouldn\u2019t cover the electricity and maintenance cost.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s paradoxical\u2014China faces the highest acquisition costs for Nvidia chips, yet GPU leasing prices are extraordinarily low,\u201d Li says. There\u2019s an oversupply of computational power, especially in central and west China, but at the same time, there\u2019s a shortage of cutting-edge chips.\nHowever, not all brokers were looking to make money from data centers in the first place. Instead, many were interested in gaming government benefits all along. Some operators exploit the sector for subsidized green electricity, obtaining permits to generate and sell power, according to Fang and some Chinese media reports. Instead of using the energy for AI workloads, they resell it back to the grid at a premium. In other cases, companies acquire land for data center development to qualify for state-backed loans and credits, leaving facilities unused while still benefiting from state funding, according to the local media outlet Jiazi Guangnian.\n\u201cTowards the end of 2024, no clear-headed contractor and broker in the market would still go into the business expecting direct profitability,\u201d says Fang. \u201cEveryone I met is leveraging the data center deal for something else the government could offer.\u201d\nA necessary evil\nDespite the underutilization of data centers, China\u2019s central government is still throwing its weight behind a push for AI infrastructure. In early 2025, it convened an AI industry symposium, emphasizing the importance of self-reliance in this technology.\nMajor Chinese tech companies are taking note, making investments aligning with this national priority. Alibaba Group announced plans to invest over $50 billion in cloud computing and AI hardware infrastructure over the next three years, while ByteDance plans to invest around $20 billion in GPUs and data centers.\nIn the meantime, companies in the US are doing likewise. Major tech firms including OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle have teamed up to commit to the Stargate initiative, which plans to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years to build advanced data centers and computing infrastructure. Given the AI competition between the two countries, experts say that China is unlikely to scale back its efforts. \u201cIf generative AI is going to be the killer technology, infrastructure is going to be the determinant of success,\u201d says Goodrich, the tech policy advisor to RAND.\n\u201cThe Chinese central government will likely see [underused data centers] as a necessary evil to develop an important capability, a growing pain of sorts. You have the failed projects and distressed assets, and the state will consolidate and clean it up. They see the end, not the means,\u201d Goodrich says.\nDemand remains strong for Nvidia chips, and especially the H20 chip, which was custom-designed for the Chinese market. One industry source, who requested not to be identified under his company policy, confirmed that the H20, a lighter, faster model optimized for AI inference, is currently the most popular Nvidia chip, followed by the H100, which continues to flow steadily into China even though sales are officially restricted by US sanctions. Some of the new demand is driven by companies deploying their own versions of DeepSeek\u2019s open-source models.\nFor now, many data centers in China sit in limbo\u2014built for a future that has yet to arrive. Whether they will find a second life remains uncertain. For Fang Cunbao, DeepSeek\u2019s success has become a moment of reckoning, casting doubt on the assumption that an endless expansion of AI infrastructure guarantees progress.\nThat\u2019s just a myth, he now realizes. At the start of this year, Fang decided to quit the data center industry altogether. \u201cThe market is too chaotic. The early adopters profited, but now it\u2019s just people chasing policy loopholes,\u201d he says. He\u2019s decided to go into AI education next.\n\u201cWhat stands between now and a future where AI is actually everywhere,\u201d he says, \u201cis not infrastructure anymore, but solid plans to deploy the technology.\u201d\nDeep Dive\nArtificial intelligence\nIn a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses\nIt\u2019s the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "How a tiny Pacific Island became the global capital of cybercrime\nDespite having a population of just 1,400, until recently, Tokelau\u2019s .tk domain had more users than any other country. Here\u2019s why.\nTokelau, a necklace of three isolated atolls strung out across the Pacific, is so remote that it was the last place on Earth to be connected to the telephone\u2014only in 1997.\nJust three years later, the islands received a fax with an unlikely business proposal that would change everything.\nIt was from an early internet entrepreneur from Amsterdam, named Joost Zuurbier. He wanted to manage Tokelau\u2019s country-code top-level domain, or ccTLD\u2014the short string of characters that is tacked onto the end of a URL.\nUp until that moment, Tokelau, formally a territory of New Zealand, didn\u2019t even know it had been assigned a ccTLD. \u201cWe discovered the .tk,\u201d remembered Aukusitino Vitale, who at the time was general manager of Teletok, Tokelau\u2019s sole telecom operator.\nZuurbier said \u201cthat he would pay Tokelau a certain amount of money and that Tokelau would allow the domain for his use,\u201d remembers Vitale. It was all a bit of a surprise\u2014but striking a deal with Zuurbier felt like a win-win for Tokelau, which lacked the resources to run its own domain. In the model pioneered by Zuurbier and his company, now named Freenom, users could register a free domain name for a year, in exchange for having advertisements hosted on their websites. If they wanted to get rid of ads, or to keep their website active in the long term, they could pay a fee.\nIn the succeeding years, tiny Tokelau became an unlikely internet giant\u2014but not in the way it may have hoped. Until recently, its .tk domain had more users than any other country\u2019s: a staggering 25 million. But there has been and still is only one website actually from Tokelau that is registered with the domain: the page for Teletok. Nearly all the others that have used .tk have been spammers, phishers, and cybercriminals.\nEveryone online has come across a .tk\u2013\u2013even if they didn\u2019t realize it. Because .tk addresses were offered for free, unlike most others, Tokelau quickly became the unwitting host to the dark underworld by providing a never-ending supply of domain names that could be weaponized against internet users. Scammers began using .tk websites to do everything from harvesting passwords and payment information to displaying pop-up ads or delivering malware.\nMany experts say that this was inevitable. \u201cThe model of giving out free domains just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d says John Levine, a leading expert on cybercrime. \u201cCriminals will take the free ones, throw it away, and take more free ones.\u201d\nTokelau, which for years was at best only vaguely aware of what was going on with .tk, has ended up tarnished. In tech-savvy circles, many painted Tokelauans with the same brush as their domain\u2019s users or suggested that they were earning handsomely from the .tk disaster. It is hard to quantify the long-term damage to Tokelau, but reputations have an outsize effect for tiny island nations, where even a few thousand dollars\u2019 worth of investment can go far. Now the territory is desperately trying to shake its reputation as the global capital of spam and to finally clean up .tk. Its international standing, and even its sovereignty, may depend on it.\nMeeting modernity\nTo understand how we got here, you have to go back to the chaotic early years of the internet. In the late \u201990s, Tokelau became the second-smallest place to be assigned a domain by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, a group tasked with maintaining the global internet.\nThese domains are the address books that make the internet navigable to its users. While you can create a website without registering a domain name for it, it would be like building a house without an easily findable postal address. Many domains are familiar. The UK has .uk, France .fr, and New Zealand .nz. There are also domains that are not tied to specific countries, such as .com and .net.\nMost countries\u2019 domains are run by low-profile foundations, government agencies, or domestic telecom companies, which usually charge a few dollars to register a domain name. They usually also require some information about who is registering and keep tabs to prevent abuse.\nBut Tokelau, with just 1,400 inhabitants, had a problem: it simply didn\u2019t have the money or know-how to run its own domain, explains Tealofi Enosa, who was the head of Teletok for a decade before stepping down in July 2023. \u201cIt would not be easy for Tokelau to try and manage or build the local infrastructure,\u201d Enosa says. \u201cThe best arrangement is for someone else from outside to manage it, trade it, and bring in money from it.\u201d\nThis is precisely what Zuurbier, the businessman from Amsterdam, wanted to do.\nZuurbier had come across Tokelau while chasing the internet\u2019s next big idea. He was convinced that just as people had adopted free email addresses by the millions, the natural next step was for them to have their own free websites. Zuurbier intended to put advertisements on those sites, which could be removed for a small fee. All he needed to turn this billion-dollar idea into reality was a place with a ccTLD that had not yet found a registrar.\nTokelau\u2014the last corner of the British Empire to be informed about the outbreak of World War I, where regular shortwave radio wasn\u2019t available until the \u201970s and most people were yet to even see a website\u2014was the perfect partner.\nRepresentatives from Tokelau and Zuurbier met in Hawaii in 2001 and put pen to paper on a deal. Quickly, .tk domain names began to pop up as people took advantage of the opportunity to create websites for free. He still had to convince ICANN, which oversees the domain name system, that Tokelau couldn\u2019t host its own servers\u2014one of the criteria for ccTLDs. But Tokelau\u2014which switched off its power at midnight\u2014would still need a reliable internet connection to keep in touch. In 2003 Zuurbier took a grueling 36-hour boat ride from Samoa to Tokelau to install internet routers that he had bought for $50 on eBay.\nGone was the unreliable dial-up. Tokelau had met modernity. \u201cHe provided all the equipment, got all the three atolls connected up, and then he also provided some funding which I used to share with the community,\u201d says Vitale, who established internet caf\u00e9s that could be used for free by anybody from Tokelau\u2019s four hamlets.\nFor the first time, thousands of Tokelauans in New Zealand were able to easily connect with home. \u201cWhat was important for Tokelau was that we were getting some money that could help the villages,\u201d says Vitale. Many of the initial sign-ups on .tk were completely innocuous individuals wanting to blog about thoughts and holidays, as well as gaming communities and small businesses.\nZuurbier sent Teletok regular reports about .tk\u2019s growth, and they indicated that the free-domain model was working better than anybody expected. Tiny Tokelau, which was being paid a small cut of the profits Zuurbier was making, was going global.\n\u201cWe were hearing how successful .tk was. We were bigger than China,\u201d says Vitale. \u201cWe were surprised, but we didn\u2019t know what it meant for Tokelau. What was more meaningful at the time was that we were getting money to help the villages. We didn\u2019t know about the other side of it then.\u201d\nAs the decade wore on, however, it looked to Vitale as if things were beginning to blow off course. \u201cWe went in blind,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how popular it would be.\u201d\nThings fall apart\nIt took until the late 2000s for Vitale to realize that something had gone badly wrong. After problems first arose, Zuurbier invited ministers and advisors from Tokelau to the Netherlands, paid for their flights, and explained the business\u2019s nuts and bolts in an effort to reassure them. They went to watch Samoa play at the Rugby World Cup in France.\n\u201cHe [Zuurbier] appeared to be a really nice person,\u201d Vitale remembers. \u201cThere was all this nice stuff that felt homely, warm fuzzies.\u201d .Tk had hit the milestone of 1 million domain users.\nBut soon after this trip, he says, Zuurbier started falling behind on scheduled payments to Tokelau worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. (MIT Technology Review requested an interview with Zuurbier. He initially accepted but subsequently did not answer the phone or respond to messages.)\nMeanwhile, Vitale had begun receiving complaints from concerned members of the \u201cinternet community.\u201d He and his peers started to become aware that criminals and other questionable figures had cottoned onto the benefits that registering free domains could bring\u2014providing an almost unlimited supply of websites that could be registered with virtual anonymity.\n\u201cIt was obvious from the start that this was not going to turn out well,\u201d says Levine, coauthor of The Internet for Dummies. \u201cThe only people who want those domains are crooks.\u201d\nLevine says that .tk had started attracting unsavory characters almost immediately. \u201cThe cost of the domain name is tiny compared to everything else that you need to do [to set up a website], so unless you\u2019re doing something weird that actually needs lots of domains\u2014which usually means criminals\u2014then the actual value in free domains is insignificant,\u201d he says.\nWhat started as techies complaining to Vitale about spamming, malware, and phishing on .tk domains soon turned into more worrisome complaints from the New Zealand administrator tasked with overseeing Tokelau, asking him whether he was aware of who .tk\u2019s users were. Allegations surfaced that .tk websites were being used for pornography. Researchers had found jihadists and the Ku Klux Klan registering .tk websites to promote extremism. Chinese state-backed hackers had been found using .tk websites for espionage campaigns.\n\u201cSatanic stuff\u201d is how Vitale describes it: \u201cThere were some activities that were not really aligned with our culture and our Christianity, so that didn\u2019t work very well for Tokelau.\u201d With Zuurbier not replying to worried emails, Vitale moved to unplug him. He opened negotiations with Internet NZ, the registry that runs New Zealand\u2019s squeaky-clean domain, about how Tokelau might be able to wiggle out of its arrangement. He didn\u2019t manage to get an answer before he moved on from Teletok.\nHis successor, Enosa, tried to set the relationship on a new footing and signed new deals with Zuurbier on the understanding that he would clean up .tk. However, that never happened. One of Enosa\u2019s final acts as general manager at Teletok, in the summer of 2023, was to reopen negotiations with Internet NZ about how Tokelau might be able to extricate itself from the deal once and for all.\nMeanwhile, most of Tokelau\u2019s residents weren\u2019t even aware of what was happening. Elena Pasilio, a journalist, saw firsthand how much this was hurting her home. When she was studying in New Zealand a few years ago, people\u2014knowing that she was Tokelauan\u2014started to tag her on social media posts complaining about .tk.\nAt first, she felt confused; it took time before she even realized that .tk meant Tokelau. \u201cI was really surprised by how many users it had, but then I realized that a lot of people were using .tk to make dodgy websites, and then I felt embarrassed. I was embarrassed because it had our name on it,\u201d Pasilio explains. \u201cIt has got our name tangled up there with crimes that people here would not even begin to understand.\u201d\nThere is a sense from both Vitale and Enosa that Zuurbier cared little as Tokelau\u2019s reputation was dragged through the mud. \u201cI would argue with Joost,\u201d Enosa says, adding that he would remind him he was the custodian for a legal asset that belonged to Tokelau alone. According to Enosa, he would shoot back: \u201cI built this infrastructure from my own pocket. I spent millions of dollars building it. Do you think that was easy? Do you think that Tokelau can build this kind of infrastructure itself?\u201d\n\u201cI said: \u2018Okay. Understood,\u2019\u201d Enosa recalls. \u201cI understood how a white man looks at it. You know? This is how white men look at things. I understand that.\u201d\nDigital colonialism\nWhat has happened to Tokelau is not unique. The domains of small islands across the Pacific are cited in numerous stories either celebrating dumb luck or complaining of massive abuse.\nTuvalu has managed to turn .tv into approximately 10% of its annual GDP. Micronesia\u2019s .fm has been pushed heavily at radio stations and podcasters. Tonga\u2019s .to has been favored by torrent and illegal streaming websites. Anguilla, in the Caribbean, is heavily marketing its .ai at technology startups.\nBut these success stories seem to be the exception. In 2016, the Anti-Phishing Working Group found that alongside .tk and .com, the Australian Cocos Islands (.cc) and Palau (.pw) together represented 75% of all malicious domain registrations. They had been flooded by phishers attacking Chinese financial institutions. The Cocos Islands made headlines in Australia when websites allegedly hosting child sexual abuse images were recently found on its domain.\nThose domains whose names\u2014by linguistic luck\u2014seemed to mean something tended to attract better managers. Sharks seem to have circled around those that did not, or had a market that was less clear.\nWhile the abuse of Pacific Islands\u2019 domains has waxed and waned over the years, the islands\u2019 tiny size means that even small associations with crime can have damaging consequences.\n\u201cThere is a problem in Polynesia,\u201d says P\u00e4r Brumark, a Swede who represents the Pacific island of Niue abroad. \u201cYou had these internet cowboys running around taking domains everywhere.\u201d\nNiue lost control over the domain .nu after it was \u201cstolen\u201d by an American in the late 1990s, Brumark says. Its management was given to the Swedish Internet Foundation\u2014which manages Sweden\u2019s native .se\u2014in a \u201cshady deal\u201d in 2013, he claims. .Nu has been wildly popular in Sweden, as it translates directly to \u201cnow.\u201d Niue, which is also linked to New Zealand, is now fighting a David-versus-Goliath battle in the Swedish courts. It is seeking as much as $20 million in lost revenue\u2014almost one year\u2019s worth of Niue\u2019s annual GDP.\n\u201cDigital colonialism,\u201d claims Brumark. \u201cThey exploit resources from another country without giving anything back. They have never spoken to the government. They have no permissions. They exploit. Colonialism to me is if you take resources from a country that you do not have the permission to take.\u201d\nBut now there may finally be some accountability\u2014at least in the case of Zuurbier.\nIn December 2022, courts in the Netherlands found in favor of an investor suing Freenom, the company that managed .tk and four other domains\u2014those of Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, and Mali\u2014that were subsequently added to the model it pioneered. The courts found that Freenom had fallen foul of various reporting rules and appointed a supervisory director.\nAnd in March of this year, Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also sued Freenom for damages, claiming that sites hosted on .tk and the four African domains were engaging in cybersquatting, phishing, and trademark infringement. Meta provided examples of websites that appeared to be registered at .tk with the express purpose of deceiving users, such as faceb00k.tk, whatsaap.tk, Instaqram.tk.\nIn an interview with the Dutch newspaper NRC, Zuurbier denied Meta\u2019s allegations about the \u201cproliferation of cybercrime.\u201d But the Cybercrime Information Center recently reported that \u201cin past years Freenom domains were used for 14% of all phishing attacks worldwide, and Freenom was responsible for 60% of the phishing domains reported in all the ccTLDs in November 2022.\u201d Zuurbier says that Freenom distributed to over 90 trusted organizations, including Meta, an API that allowed them to take down offending sites and that Meta itself failed to continue using it. But many in the tech industry resent what they see as Freenom shifting the cost of policing its domains onto others.\nAs of January 2023, it is no longer possible to register a .tk domain. All four African countries\u2014many thousands of times larger than Tokelau\u2014have broken ties with Freenom. Tokelau, which did not seem aware that there were other countries in the same boat, is still trying to figure out what to do next.\nIt now looks as if Freenom is essentially finished as a company. But Enosa doesn\u2019t believe that\u2019ll stop Zuurbier from pursuing more shady schemes. \u201cJoost always wins,\u201d he says.\nShifting tactics\nWithout access to the unlimited pool of free domain names that were available through .tk and the four other Freenom ccTLDs, many cybercrime groups that relied on them are being forced to adapt. Certain scattergun approaches to spamming and phishing are likely to go out of fashion. \u201cSpammers are fairly rational,\u201d explains Levine, the spam expert. \u201cIf the spam is cheap and the domains are free, they can afford to send out a lot of spam even though the likelihood of response is lower. If they actually have to pay for the domains, then they are likely to make it a lot more targeted.\u201d\n\u201cBad things online require a domain name at some point,\u201d says Carel Bitter, head of data at the Spamhaus Project, which tracks malicious activities online. \u201cYou need people to go somewhere to fill in their account details. If you can\u2019t get domains for free, you will have to get them somewhere else.\u201d Analysts have noted upticks in malicious use of cheap \u201cnew\u201d generic TLDs such as .xyz, .top, and .live, whose reputations have been wrecked by dodgy dealers.\nWhile other domains may only cost $1, a drop in the ocean for the largest gangs, the fact that they now need to be purchased may limit the damage, says Bitter: \u201cAny cybercrime business that relies on domain names will have some sort of natural limit that determines how much they can spend on domain names.\u201d Others, though, may seek to compromise existing websites with low security.\nIt is likely that \u201cbasement\u201d operations\u2014so-called \u201cankle-biters\u201d\u2014will feel the biggest pinch. \u201cWhat is possible is that the guys that are just doing it as a dabble won\u2019t want to put the money up, but the professionals are not going away,\u201d says Dave Piscitello, director of research activity at the Cybercrime Information Center. \u201cThey will go elsewhere. If you are staging a revolution and the cost of a Kalashnikov goes from $150 to $250, you aren\u2019t going to say \u2018Forget it.\u2019 It is the business.\u201d\nAn existential issue\nThe media sometimes reports that Tokelau makes millions from the use of .tk. Zuurbier himself claims on his LinkedIn that his relationship with Tokelau adds over 10% to the atolls\u2019 GDP.\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d says Enosa when asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d\nEnosa claims that .tk provided a \u201cvery small\u201d proportion of Teletok\u2019s income: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give us good money. .Tk was nothing to my revenue.\u201d\nWhile the arrival of the internet on Tokelau promised to zip information across the Pacific instantaneously, the islands have remained isolated. Even while I was reporting this story, it took weeks to get in touch with Pasilio and other sources there. Interviews were repeatedly delayed because of the price of data packages. Internet in Tokelau is among the most expensive in the world, and NZ$100 (US$60) worth of data can sometimes last only 24 hours at a time. Phone calls to Tokelau from Europe did not connect.\n\u201cI feel sorry for our Tokelau,\u201d Pasilio says. \u201cWe have been taken advantage of. I think people would be shocked if they knew what had been going on with .Tk.\u201d\nEven many Tokelau elders had not fully understood the problem, at least until recently.\nThere are other, arguably more existential problems the islands need to deal with, including climate change, emigration, and the atolls\u2019 future relationship with New Zealand. \u201cOur islands are already shrinking as it is, with the sea levels rising,\u201d says Pasilio. She says her father tells her about reefs and sand banks that have sunk beneath the Pacific. \u201cThey would rather worry about things that they can see physically and that they know more about, rather than fighting back on this .Tk thing,\u201d she says.\nBut the issue of the abused .tk domain was recently raised in the General Fono, or Parliament, indicating that the issue had finally broken out of its technical niche and into the wider public.\nThose existential issues facing the islands are not wholly unrelated to .tk. Questions over the future of the domain have arisen at the same time that a debate over Tokelau\u2019s political future has been revived.\nTokelau is classified by the United Nations as a \u201cnon-self-governing territory\u201d under the oversight of the Special Committee on Decolonization. In 2006 and 2007, referenda on whether Tokelau would enter \u201cfree association\u201d with New Zealand\u2014a possible stepping stone toward eventual independence\u2014was approved, but not enough of Tokelau\u2019s population voted to meet the turnout threshold. In May 2022, it was decided that another referendum on Tokelau\u2019s future would be held ahead of the centenary of New Zealand rule in 2025.\nRepairing Tokelau\u2019s devastated international reputation by cleaning up .tk will be a necessity if the atolls are to make any serious bid for sovereignty. Vitale is now the general manager of Tokelau\u2019s government and wants to see its internet domain make a triumphant return to make it clear that the islands are turning a new page.\n\u201cWe are building nationhood here,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe are on a pathway toward self-determination. We want to use the .tk as a catalyst to promote our nationhood and be proud of it\u2014our domain name and our identity among the internet community.\u201d\nAll of Tokelau\u2019s email and website addresses are currently hosted on New Zealand\u2019s .nz. \u201cWhat does that mean to people? It means that we are in New Zealand,\u201d says Vitale with a sigh. \u201cWe should be selling ourselves as being in Tokelau, because .tk is the domain\u2014the identity\u2014for Tokelau.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you have people coming to knock on your door with attractive packages,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou see it as an opportunity you hook onto\u2014not realizing what the consequences will be further down the road.\u201d\nCorrection: This story has been updated post-publication as the previous version incorrectly stated that Antigua was the Carribean island with the .ai domain.

      "text": "Synthesia\u2019s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they\u2019ll be able to talk back.\nThe uncanny valley is narrowing. Are we ready for what comes next?\nEarlier this summer, I walked through the glassy lobby of a fancy office in London, into an elevator, and then along a corridor into a clean, carpeted room. Natural light flooded in through its windows, and a large pair of umbrella-like lighting rigs made the room even brighter. I tried not to squint as I took my place in front of a tripod equipped with a large camera and a laptop displaying an autocue. I took a deep breath and started to read out the script.\nI\u2019m not a newsreader or an actor auditioning for a movie\u2014I was visiting the AI company Synthesia to give it what it needed to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company\u2019s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.\nWhen Synthesia launched in 2017, its primary purpose was to match AI versions of real human faces\u2014for example, the former footballer David Beckham\u2014with dubbed voices speaking in different languages. A few years later, in 2020, it started giving the companies that signed up for its services the opportunity to make professional-level presentation videos starring either AI versions of staff members or consenting actors. But the technology wasn\u2019t perfect. The avatars\u2019 body movements could be jerky and unnatural, their accents sometimes slipped, and the emotions indicated by their voices didn\u2019t always match their facial expressions.\nNow Synthesia\u2019s avatars have been updated with more natural mannerisms and movements, as well as expressive voices that better preserve the speaker\u2019s accent\u2014making them appear more humanlike than ever before. For Synthesia\u2019s corporate clients, these avatars will make for slicker presenters of financial results, internal communications, or staff training videos.\nI found the video demonstrating my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It\u2019s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn\u2019t know me, you\u2019d probably think that\u2019s exactly what it was. This demonstration shows how much harder it\u2019s becoming to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us?\nThe creation process\nWhen my former colleague Melissa visited Synthesia\u2019s London studio to create an avatar of herself last year, she had to go through a long process of calibrating the system, reading out a script in different emotional states, and mouthing the sounds needed to help her avatar form vowels and consonants. As I stand in the brightly lit room 15 months later, I\u2019m relieved to hear that the creation process has been significantly streamlined. Josh Baker-Mendoza, Synthesia\u2019s technical supervisor, encourages me to gesture and move my hands as I would during natural conversation, while simultaneously warning me not to move too much. I duly repeat an overly glowing script that\u2019s designed to encourage me to speak emotively and enthusiastically. The result is a bit as if if Steve Jobs had been resurrected as a blond British woman with a low, monotonous voice.\nIt also has the unfortunate effect of making me sound like an employee of Synthesia.\u201cI am so thrilled to be with you today to show off what we\u2019ve been working on. We are on the edge of innovation, and the possibilities are endless,\u201d I parrot eagerly, trying to sound lively rather than manic. \u201cSo get ready to be part of something that will make you go, \u2018Wow!\u2019 This opportunity isn\u2019t just big\u2014it\u2019s monumental.\u201d\nJust an hour later, the team has all the footage it needs. A couple of weeks later I receive two avatars of myself: one powered by the previous Express-1 model and the other made with the latest Express-2 technology. The latter, Synthesia claims, makes its synthetic humans more lifelike and true to the people they\u2019re modeled on, complete with more expressive hand gestures, facial movements, and speech. You can see the results for yourself below.\nLast year, Melissa found that her Express-1-powered avatar failed to match her transatlantic accent. Its range of emotions was also limited\u2014when she asked her avatar to read a script angrily, it sounded more whiny than furious. In the months since, Synthesia has improved Express-1, but the version of my avatar made with the same technology blinks furiously and still struggles to synchronize body movements with speech.\nBy way of contrast, I\u2019m struck by just how much my new Express-2 avatar looks like me: Its facial features mirror my own perfectly. Its voice is spookily accurate too, and although it gesticulates more than I do, its hand movements generally marry up with what I\u2019m saying.\nBut the tiny telltale signs of AI generation are still there if you know where to look. The palms of my hands are bright pink and as smooth as putty. Strands of hair hang stiffly around my shoulders instead of moving with me. Its eyes stare glassily ahead, rarely blinking. And although the voice is unmistakably mine, there\u2019s something slightly off about my digital clone\u2019s intonations and speech patterns. \u201cThis is great!\u201d my avatar randomly declares, before slipping back into a saner register.\nAnna Eiserbeck, a postdoctoral psychology researcher at the Humboldt University of Berlin who has studied how humans react to perceived deepfake faces, says she isn\u2019t sure she\u2019d have been able to identify my avatar as a deepfake at first glance.\nBut she would eventually have noticed something amiss. It\u2019s not just the small details that give it away\u2014my oddly static earring, the way my body sometimes moves in small, abrupt jerks. It\u2019s something that runs much deeper, she explains.\n\u201cSomething seemed a bit empty. I know there\u2019s no actual emotion behind it\u2014 it\u2019s not a conscious being. It does not feel anything,\u201d she says. Watching the video gave her \u201cthis kind of uncanny feeling.\u201d\nMy digital clone, and Eiserbeck\u2019s reaction to it, make me wonder how realistic these avatars really need to be.\nI realize that part of the reason I feel disconcerted by my avatar is that it behaves in a way I rarely have to. Its oddly upbeat register is completely at odds with how I normally speak; I\u2019m a die-hard cynical Brit who finds it difficult to inject enthusiasm into my voice even when I\u2019m genuinely thrilled or excited. It\u2019s just the way I am. Plus, watching the videos on a loop makes me question if I really do wave my hands about that way, or move my mouth in such a weird manner. If you thought being confronted with your own face on a Zoom call was humbling, wait until you\u2019re staring at a whole avatar of yourself.\nWhen Facebook was first taking off in the UK almost 20 years ago, my friends and I thought illicitly logging into each other\u2019s accounts and posting the most outrageous or rage-inducing status updates imaginable was the height of comedy. I wonder if the equivalent will soon be getting someone else\u2019s avatar to say something truly embarrassing: expressing support for a disgraced politician or (in my case) admitting to liking Ed Sheeran\u2019s music.\nExpress-2 remodels every person it\u2019s presented with into a polished professional speaker with the body language of a hyperactive hype man. And while this makes perfect sense for a company focused on making glossy business videos, watching my avatar doesn\u2019t feel like watching me at all. It feels like something else entirely.\nHow it works\nThe real technical challenge these days has less to do with creating avatars that match our appearance than with getting them to replicate our behavior, says Bj\u00f6rn Schuller, a professor of artificial intelligence at Imperial College London. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to consider to get right; you have to have the right micro gesture, the right intonation, the sound of voice and the right word,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want an AI [avatar] to frown at the wrong moment\u2014that could send an entirely different message.\u201d\nTo achieve an improved level of realism, Synthesia developed a number of new audio and video AI models. The team created a voice cloning model to preserve the human speaker\u2019s accent, intonation, and expressiveness\u2014unlike other voice models, which can flatten speakers\u2019 distinctive accents into generically American-sounding voices.\nWhen a user uploads a script to Express-1, its system analyzes the words to infer the correct tone to use. That information is then fed into a diffusion model, which renders the avatar\u2019s facial expressions and movements to match the speech.\nAlongside the voice model, Express-2 uses three other models to create and animate the avatars. The first generates an avatar\u2019s gestures to accompany the speech fed into it by the Express-Voice model. A second evaluates how closely the input audio aligns with the multiple versions of the corresponding generated motion before selecting the best one. Then a final model renders the avatar with that chosen motion.\nThis third rendering model is significantly more powerful than its Express-1 predecessor. Whereas the previous model had a few hundred million parameters, Express-2\u2019s rendering model\u2019s parameters number in the billions. This means it takes less time to create the avatar, says Youssef Alami Mejjati, Synthesia\u2019s head of research and development:\n\u201cWith Express-1, it needed to first see someone expressing emotions to be able to render them. Now, because we\u2019ve trained it on much more diverse data and much larger data sets, with much more compute, it just learns these associations automatically without needing to see them.\u201d\nNarrowing the uncanny valley\nAlthough humanlike AI-generated avatars have been around for years, the recent boom in generative AI is making it increasingly easier and more affordable to create lifelike synthetic humans\u2014and they\u2019re already being put to work. Synthesia isn\u2019t alone: AI avatar companies like Yuzu Labs, Creatify, Arcdads, and Vidyard give businesses the tools to quickly generate and edit videos starring either AI actors or artificial versions of members of staff, promising cost-effective ways to make compelling ads that audiences connect with. Similarly, AI-generated clones of livestreamers have exploded in popularity across China in recent years, partly because they can sell products 24/7 without getting tired or needing to be paid.\nFor now at least, Synthesia is \u201claser focused\u201d on the corporate sphere. But it\u2019s not ruling out expanding into new sectors such as entertainment or education, says Peter Hill, the company\u2019s chief technical officer. In an apparent step toward this, Synthesia recently partnered with Google to integrate Google\u2019s powerful new generative video model Veo 3 into its platform, allowing users to directly generate and embed clips into Synthesia\u2019s videos. It suggests that in the future, these hyperrealistic artificial humans could take up starring roles in detailed universes with ever-changeable backdrops.\nAt present this could, for example, involve using Veo 3 to generate a video of meat-processing machinery, with a Synthesia avatar next to the machines talking about how to use them safely. But future versions of Synthesia\u2019s technology could result in educational videos customizable to an individual\u2019s level of knowledge, says Alex Voica, head of corporate affairs and policy at Synthesia. For example, a video about the evolution of life on Earth could be tweaked for someone with a biology degree or someone with high-school-level knowledge. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be such a much more engaging and personalized way of delivering content that I\u2019m really excited about,\u201d he says.\nThe next frontier, according to Synthesia, will be avatars that can talk back, \u201cunderstanding\u201d conversations with users and responding in real time Think ChatGPT, but with a lifelike digital human attached.\nSynthesia has already added an interactive element by letting users click through on-screen questions during quizzes presented by its avatars. But it\u2019s also exploring making them truly interactive: Future users could ask their avatar to pause and expand on a point, or ask it a question. \u201cWe really want to make the best learning experience, and that means through video that\u2019s entertaining but also personalized and interactive,\u201d says Alami Mejjati. \u201cThis, for me, is the missing part in online learning experiences today. And I know we\u2019re very close to solving that.\u201d\nWe already know that humans can\u2014and do\u2014form deep emotional bonds with AI systems, even with basic text-based chatbots. Combining agentic technology\u2014which is already capable of navigating the web, coding, and playing video games unsupervised\u2014with a realistic human face could usher in a whole new kind of AI addiction, says Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab.\n\u201cIf you make the system too realistic, people might start forming certain kinds of relationships with these characters,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many cases where AI companions have influenced dangerous behavior even when they are basically texting. If an avatar had a talking head, it would be even more addictive.\u201d\nSchuller agrees that avatars in the near future will be perfectly optimized to adjust their projected levels of emotion and charisma so that their human audiences will stay engaged for as long as possible. \u201cIt will be very hard [for humans] to compete with charismatic AI of the future; it\u2019s always present, always has an ear for you, and is always understanding,\u201d he says. \u201cAl will change that human-to-human connection.\u201d\nAs I pause and replay my Express-2 avatar, I imagine holding conversations with it\u2014this uncanny, permanently upbeat, perpetually available product of pixels and algorithms that looks like me and sounds like me, but fundamentally isn\u2019t me. Virtual Rhiannon has never laughed until she\u2019s cried, or fallen in love, or run a marathon, or watched the sun set in another country.\nBut, I concede, she could deliver a damned good presentation about why Ed Sheeran is the greatest musician ever to come out of the UK. And only my closest friends and family would know that it\u2019s not the real me.\nDeep Dive\nArtificial intelligence\nIn a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses\nIt\u2019s the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "Nine months into the year, 2025 has already provided an unexpectedly banger run of video games. We\u2019ve gotten lost in blue-hued mansions and wielded baguettes in fights against god. We\u2019ve punched our way through layers of the underworld and cloned ourselves on hostile exoplanets. We\u2019ve cooked pork. Who needs Grand Theft Auto 6?\nBut here\u2019s the scary thing: If you look at 2025 through the lens of new game releases, the year\u2019s only getting started. Even beyond next week\u2019s Hollow Knight: Silksong nuke, there are still, frankly, enough fascinating-looking games to fill a backlog for the remainder of this console generation. Here are just 25 we\u2019re most excited to play through the rest of 2025, organized by release date.\n1. Garfield Kart 2 \u2014 All You Can Drift (Sept. 10)\nYou want your five-star games? You want your Game of the Year-winning classics? Not me! I want Garfield Kart 2 \u2013 All You Can Drift. While Microids\u2019 upcoming Mario Kart riff is unlikely to win any awards this year, I plan to play the heck out of it. I\u2019m not going to pretend like there\u2019s a complex reason for it; I just like Garfield, OK? And with a kart-racing sequel that feels much better than its memetic predecessor thanks to drifting, that\u2019s as good a reason as any to check in with my dude Garf. \u2014Giovanni Colantonio\n2. Borderlands 4 (Sept. 12)\nFor perhaps the first time in series history, the next Borderlands can\u2019t be described as simply \u201cmorederlands.\u201d (Get it? Because \u201cmore\u201d plus\u2026 OK, cool.) An actually open open-world. A stated aversion to toilet humor. A focus on RPG build-crafting. Sure, the core Borderlands ingredients of 87 bajillion guns and an intoxicating loot grind haven\u2019t gone anyway. But for Borderlands 4, developer Gearbox is radically reinventing parts of the series after 15 years of creative inertia. Regardless of how fun it is (it looks quite fun), that\u2019s a delight to see. \u2014Ari Notis\n3. Lego Voyagers (Sept. 15)\nIn between licensed Lego games like 2024\u2019s Lego Horizon Adventures and the upcoming Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, a whimsical co-op adventure is set to steal the Lego spotlight. Lego Voyagers casts you and your gaming partner as sentient Lego bricks, one red, the other blue. Like the work of Hazelight Studios (It Takes Two, Split Fiction), players will have to work together to advance in Lego Voyagers via puzzle solving and platforming. And in a pro-consumer move, Lego Voyagers will include a Friend\u2019s Pass, meaning two players can play through the entire co-op adventure online, but only one needs to own the game. \u2014 Austin Manchester\n4. Baby Steps (Sept. 23)\nGhost of Y\u014dtei may be this fall\u2019s biggest open-world game, but I\u2019d wager that Baby Steps will be its funniest. The new collaboration between Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and QWOP creator Bennett Foddy is a slapstick comedy of errors. It stars a onesie-wearing couch potato who gets sucked into a fantasy world. He must scale perilous cliffsides to survive, but walking is no easy task for someone who spends so much time binging Netflix. The result is a physics sim with strong comedic potential, bringing the comedy that turned QWOP into a viral hit to new heights. \u2014GC\n5. Silent Hill f (Sept. 25)\nAs exciting as the remakes are, I've been craving a new Silent Hill game since Downpour came out in 2012, and I'm excited to see what kind of spine-chilling mysteries Konami has been cooking up for Silent Hill f. Although the original Silent Hill was made by a Japanese team, we've yet to see a game actually set in Japan, and I can't wait to see the series' J-horror elements cranked up to the max. I'm a big fan of horror that leans into disturbing elements rather than simply disgusting ones, and with producer Motoi Okamoto stating he wants players to \"find the beauty in terror,\" it sounds like a stunning-yet-deeply-psychological experience is exactly what we're going to get. \u2014Claire Lewis\n6. Sonic Racing: Crossworlds (Sept. 25)\nThe Sonic Racing games have been among the better kart racers of the past 15 years or so, but even so it seemed unlikely that they would ever deliver a Mario Kart-beater \u2014 within months of an actual and pretty great new Mario Kart, no less. But CrossWorlds might just do it. It\u2019s brash and inventive, with absurd cameos from the likes of Like a Dragon\u2019s Ichiban Kasuga. But most importantly, it\u2019s developed in Japan using Sega\u2019s legendary expertise in arcade racing (members of the Initial D team contributed). An in-house Sega racing game hasn\u2019t seen a mainstream home release in decades. Now that\u2019s exciting. \u2014Oli Welsh\n7. Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles (Sept. 30)\nUp until now, recommending must-play Final Fantasy games for new players has been a challenge, to say the least, especially with the transcendent Final Fantasy Tactics locked behind old systems. Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles will change that soon. Instead of focusing on fantastical elements, Final Fantasy Tactics is built around a sobering narrative and political intrigue, which gain life in tactical grid-based combat, making it one of the best spinoffs of the famous RPG franchise. Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles isn\u2019t just about having fun, but engaging with an important piece of RPG history. \u2014Paulo Kawanishi\n8. Ghost of Y\u014dtei (Oct. 2)\nYes, Ghost of Y\u014dtei looks like a tremendous open-world game, another leap forward in a genre that could always stand some refining. But I\u2019m lukewarm about the glut of activities or the natural wayfinding or the gorgeous, sweeping landscapes of its 16th-century Japan setting. I want to see how fast this thing loads. Its predecessor, 2020\u2019s Ghost of Tsushima, has such fast load speeds that developer Sucker Punch famously had to slow them down \u2014 and that was on aging PlayStation 4 hardware. How fast will the sequel load? Will it be literally instantaneous? Is Ghost of Y\u014dtei going to be the secret to time travel, loading in negative seconds? Did I write this from the future? \u2014AN\n9. Digimon Story Time Stranger (Oct. 3)\n2025 is the year of Digimon, and Digimon Story Time Stranger is the cherry on the top of an immense digital cake. Time Stranger is the update old fans like myself have been waiting for, from the visual treatment each creature is receiving to the Digital World: Iliad, a region never explored in previous games. Brand-new Digimon are being designed for the game, like MasterBlimpmon \u2014 a military submarine-like Digimon \u2014 and the game will even allow us to ride the creatures! While this new title is just the perfect early Christmas present for fans, Time Stranger is the best time to jump on the digital wagon, since most of the experience will be new to everyone. \u2014PK\n10. Absolum (Oct. 9)\nFew publishers have a track record like Dotemu, thanks to a consistent wave of hits like Streets of Rage 4 and Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound that have set the bar for retro revivals. That alone gives me enough reason to keep my eye on Absolum. The hybrid roguelike beat-'em-up finds the studio, as well as co-developers Guard Crush and Supa Monk, building a new IP that fuses new and old. The result is a very promising side-scrolling action game that\u2019s taking a fresh approach to the kinds of retro games Dotemu does best. \u2014GC"

      "text": "Space travel is dangerous. Could genetic testing and gene editing make it safer?\nAstronauts and commercial space travelers are subject to damaging radiation and microgravity, along with other potential injuries. We need better ways to protect them.\nThis article first appeared in The Checkup, MIT Technology Review\u2019s weekly biotech newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read articles like this first, sign up here.\nRecently, global news has been pretty bleak. So this week, I\u2019ve decided to focus my thoughts beyond Earth\u2019s stratosphere and well into space. A couple of weeks ago, SpaceX launched four private astronauts into orbit, where they performed the first ever spacewalk undertaken by private citizens (as opposed to astronauts trained by national agencies).\nThe company has more ambitious plans for space travel, and it\u2019s not alone. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, claimed on Sunday that he would launch uncrewed missions to Mars within two years, and crewed missions four years after that if the uncrewed missions were successful. (Other SpaceX timelines for reaching the Red Planet haven\u2019t panned out.) NASA refers to Mars as its \u201chorizon goal for human exploration.\u201d China previously announced plans for a human mission as early as 2033 and recently moved up its timeline for an uncrewed sample return mission by two years. And the UAE has a 100-year plan to construct a habitable community on Mars by 2117.\nNone of this will be straightforward. Long-distance space travel can wreak havoc on human health. There\u2019s radiation and microgravity to contend with, as well as the psychological toll of isolation and confinement. Research on identical twin astronauts has also revealed a slew of genetic changes that happen when a person spends a year in space.\nThat\u2019s why some bioethicists are exploring the idea of radical treatments for future astronauts. Once we\u2019ve figured out all the health impacts of space travel, they argue, we should edit the genomes of astronauts ahead of launch to offer them the best protection. Some have even suggested this might result in the creation of an all-new species: Homo spatialis. If this is starting to sound a bit like sci-fi, that\u2019s because\u2014for now, at least\u2014it is. But there are biotechnologies we can use to help space travelers now, too.\nSpace travel is risky. When it comes down to it, a space launch essentially involves strapping humans into a capsule and exploding a bomb beneath them, says Paul Root Wolpe, who served as NASA\u2019s senior bioethicist for 15 years.\nOnce you\u2019re in space, you\u2019re subject to far higher levels of radiation than you\u2019d encounter on Earth. Too much radiation can increase a person\u2019s risk of cancer and neurological disorders. It can also harm body tissues, resulting in cataracts or digestive diseases, for example. That\u2019s why agencies like the US Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration set limits on radiation exposure. (NASA also sets limits on the amount of radiation astronauts can be exposed to.)\nThen there\u2019s microgravity. Our bodies have adapted to Earth\u2019s gravity. Without that gravitational pull, strange things can happen. For one thing, internal fluids can start to pool at the top of the body. Muscles don\u2019t need to work as hard when there\u2019s no gravity, and astronauts tend to experience loss of muscle mass as well as bone.\nFive years ago, scientists working with NASA published the results of a groundbreaking study comparing two identical twins\u2014one of whom spent a year in space while the other remained on Earth. The twins, Mark and Scott Kelly, were both trained astronauts. And because they have the same set of genes, researchers were able to compare them to assess the impact of long-term space travel on how genes work.\nThe researchers found that both twins experienced some changes to the way their genes worked over that period, but they changed in different ways. Some of the effects in the space-faring brother lasted for more than six months. These changes are thought to be a response to the stress of space travel and perhaps a reaction to the DNA damage caused by space radiation.\nSpace travel comes with other risks, including weight loss, permanent eye damage caused by what is known as \u201cspaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome,\u201d and psychological distress as a result of being far from friends and loved ones.\nAnd if all that weren\u2019t enough, injuries are also common on space missions, says Wolpe, who is now founding director of the Center for Peace Building and Conflict Transformation at Emory University. Tools and equipment can float around, knocking into people. Bungee cords snap. \u201cAstronauts are supposed to wear safety goggles at all times, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d says Wolpe. \u201cThe injury list is lengthy \u2026 it\u2019s really surprising how many injuries were [sustained] by astronauts on the space station.\u201d\nCommercial space travel brings a new set of dangers. Until very recently, the only people who traveled to space went through rigorous health tests and training programs overseen by national agencies. That isn\u2019t the case for private space travel, where the rules are determined by the individual company, says Wolpe.\nAstronauts are screened for common conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. Space tourists might not be. We\u2019re still learning the basics when it comes to the impact of space travel on health. We have no idea how it might affect a person who has various disorders and takes multiple medications.\nCould gene editing protect astronauts from these potential problems? People who have adapted to high altitudes on Earth have genetic factors that allow them to thrive in low-oxygen environments\u2014what if we could confer these factors to astronauts? And while we\u2019re at it, why not throw in some more genetic changes\u2014ones that might protect them from bone or muscle loss, for example?\nHere's where we get into Homo spatialis territory\u2014the idea of a new species better suited to a life in space, or on a planet other than Earth. For the time being, this approach is not an option\u2014there are currently no gene therapies that have been designed for people undertaking space travel. But one day \u201cit might be in the best interests of the astronauts to undergo some genetic intervention, like gene editing, to safeguard them,\u201d says Rosario Isasi, a bioethicist at the University of Miami. \u201cIt might be more than a duty, but a condition for an astronaut going on these missions.\u201d\nWolpe is not keen on the idea. \u201cThere is some integrity to being human, and to the human body, that should not be breached,\u201d he says. \u201cThese kinds of modifications are going to \u2026 end up with a number of disasters.\u201d Isasi also hopes that advances in precision medicine, which will make possible bespoke treatments for individuals, might sidestep the need for genetic modifications.\nIn the meantime, genetic testing could be helpful for both astronauts and space tourists, says Wolpe. Some body tissues are more vulnerable to radiation damage, including the thyroid gland. Genetic tests that reveal a person\u2019s risk of thyroid cancer might be useful for those considering space travel, he says.\nWhether people are going into space as tourists, employees, scientists, or research subjects, figuring out how to send them safely is vitally important. After all, space tourism is nothing like regular tourism. \u201cYou\u2019re putting [people] in a situation the human body was never designed to be in,\u201d says Wolpe.\nNow read the rest of The Checkup\nRead more from MIT Technology Review\u2019s archive\nScientists can test-drive space missions in extreme and remote environments here on Earth. \u201cAnalogue astronaut facilities,\u201d which have been set up in deserts and in the Antarctic, simulate the isolating experience of real space travel, Sarah Scoles reports.\nAstronaut meals could be set for a slightly weird overhaul. The prepackaged food currently used has a shelf life of around a year and a half. Making food from astronauts\u2019 breath could one day be an alternative solution for longer space missions, writes Jonathan O\u2019Callaghan.\nOnly 11 people can fit on the International Space Station at once. Perhaps a self-assembling space habitat\u2014complete with a sea-anemone-inspired sofa\u2014could provide alternative living quarters, writes Sarah Ward.\nMore than a dozen robotic vehicles are scheduled to land on the moon in the 2020s, and there are plans in the works for \u201clunar economies\u201d and \u201cpermanent settlements,\u201d reports Jonathan O\u2019Callaghan in this piece that explores what\u2019s next for the moon.\nThe International Space Station is getting old, and there are plans to destroy it by 2030. Now NASA is partnering with private companies to develop new commercial space stations for research, manufacturing, and tourism, reports David W. Brown.\nFrom around the web\nThe team that earned the Nobel Prize for developing CRISPR is asking to cancel two of their own seminal patents. My colleague Antonio Regalado has the scoop.
