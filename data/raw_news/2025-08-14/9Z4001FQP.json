Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), a tribal citizen of the Cherokee Nation and a member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, drives illegally as he navigates Washington, D.C. in his Jeep.\n\nDuring a Fox News interview on Sunday, Mullin said he doesn\u2019t wear a seatbelt when driving in the nation\u2019s capital because he is afraid of being carjacked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be stuck in my vehicle when I need to exit in a hurry, because I got a seatbelt around me and that \u2014 and I wear my seatbelt all the time,\u201d he told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade.\n\nMullin was responding to President Donald Trump\u2019s call to militarize Washington, D.C., by taking over the D.C. police force and sending in the National Guard.\n\nNever miss Indian Country\u2019s biggest stories and breaking news.

However, Trump\u2019s and Mullin\u2019s facts don\u2019t add up.\n\nHere are the facts:\n\nAt its peak in June 2023, Washington, D.C. recorded a carjacking rate of 20.6 per 100,000 residents. By June 2025, that rate had dropped sharply to 5.1 per 100,000 \u2014 a reduction of 75%, according to the Council on Criminal Justice.\n\nMullin lives in Westville, Oklahoma, near the Arkansas state line and about 80 miles from Tulsa. In 2023, the most recent year for which FBI statistics are available, there were 3,139 vehicle thefts in Tulsa \u2014 a rate of 765.4 per 100,000 residents.*\n\nDoes he wear his seatbelt in Tulsa?\n\n* For Tulsa, Oklahoma, carjackings are often tracked under broader categories like \"motor vehicle theft\" or \"robbery,\" and specific carjacking statistics at the municipal level are rarely made available.\n\nAbout the Author: \"Levi \\\"Calm Before the Storm\\\" Rickert (Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation) is the founder, publisher and editor of Native News Online.
