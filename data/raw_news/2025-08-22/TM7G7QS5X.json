  "content": "Thursday morning on the Long Island coast sure didn\u2019t look like a surfer\u2019s paradise. It was chilly, misty and gray, and the sea looked fussy. Pedestrians along the boardwalk huddled in windbreakers and sweatshirts.\n\nThen, a sudden movement on the ocean: Among the dozens of figures in neoprene suits in the choppy water, bobbing up and down, a lone surfer erupted in a fierce paddle. He popped up to his feet, dropped down the face of what looked to be an eight-foot wave \u2014 huge for an August day on Long Island \u2014 slid into the barrel and was spit out triumphantly.\n\nThis is the kind of wave that New York surfers dream of catching all year long.\n\nAs Hurricane Erin moved up the East Coast, surfers in and around New York City, who are known to put on hooded wet suits in February to chase decent waves, are enjoying the rarity of the best waves of the season on a summer day.",
