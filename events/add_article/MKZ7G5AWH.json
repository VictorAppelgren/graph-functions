      "title": "Liberty University faces second lawsuit accusing it of mishandling sexual assault cases",
      "summary": "Former Liberty University employee Erika Woolfolk has sued the Christian university, claiming she was fired for cooperating with a federal investigation into the school’s handling of sexual assault cases and that she endured a hostile, racially discriminatory workplace with unequal pay. Liberty denies the allegations, saying her termination was for legitimate business reasons tied to Title IX investigations, and the suit follows a similar case by former investigator Peter Brake. The lawsuit comes amid a $16 million fine imposed by the Department of Education for widespread Title IX and Clery Act violations, and the university is under federal monitoring until 2026. Liberty also recently settled a lawsuit with former president Jerry Falwell Jr. for a similar claim of retaliation, while the federal probe has uncovered a culture of fear that discouraged survivors from reporting incidents.",
