  "title": "Quiet firing is spreading, but there are business risks to tactics to push workers out",
  "description": "Businesses looking to cut jobs don't want to do it through layoffs, but stricter RTO rules and other tactics are pushing workers out.",
  "content": "As more companies demand employees spend more days in their workplaces each week, some critics claim that tightening return to office (RTO) rules in part aim to provoke resignations from employees unwilling to give up their remote or hybrid work arrangements. Data now suggests employer use of that indirect quiet-firing manner of reducing head count is far more widespread than previously suspected \u2014 and often involves tactics that go beyond ordering people back to their desks.\n\nReinforced RTO mandates, especially by large companies like Amazon and Starbucks, sparked accusations that management\u2019s tighter in-office requirements are a cover for pushing flexibility-loving workers to quit. It turns out, businesses are also using other methods to trim head count, including cutting worker benefits, increasing workloads, delaying pay raises, or gradually isolating targets in the workplace until they resign. A recent survey of 1,128 U.S. business leaders by CV writing platform ResumeTemplates found 42 percent of respondents admitted to having used those quiet-firing strategies this year, with an additional 11 percent saying they plan to do so in coming months. The main reason that total of 53 percent of participants said they\u2019d employed the stratagem was to avoid severance, legal, and other costs that layoffs usually generate. They also credited the ruse with averting the bad blood and even worse reputational damage that firing people can create. In addition to establishing that a small majority of employers have or intend to resort to quiet firing this year, the survey also identified the most common methods that managers use to passively push workers toward the door.\n\nDelaying promised raises topped the list, with 47 percent of participants citing the tactic. That compared with 46 percent of respondents who said they\u2019d tightened RTO or other workplace rules, 45 percent who increased workloads without compensation, and 32 percent who cut wages or benefits to sour employees on their jobs. Micromanaging workers \u2014 or, inversely, cutting them out of projects and consultations entirely \u2014 was another method mentioned, as was ignoring toxic environments that undermine the well-being of people designated for departure. The scenarios for which the passive maneuver to lower head count was used varied. Around 41 percent of participating managers said they\u2019d deployed it against specific employees they\u2019d deemed troublesome, problematic, or simply unwanted. That included 47 percent of respondents who said they\u2019d embraced quiet firing to get rid of underperforming employees, and 41 percent who\u2019d used it with staff who complained about or resisted strengthened RTO rules. Just over a third of participants said the method allowed them to sidestep severance payments that often accompany formal layoffs, with an equal 34 percent crediting it with lowering the attendant legal headaches. Around 32 percent said the passively manipulative approach allowed them to avoid the bad external publicity that can arise when businesses cut staff.\n\nBut company owners and executives who answered the survey also noted there were broader economic and business reasons that made lowering head count necessary. In many cases, quiet firing was ultimately selected as the means to achieve that. The most frequently cited of those external pressures was slowing revenue and sales, at 50 percent. Adjusting to increased costs from import tariffs was second, at 46 percent. Nearly 40 percent of participants said staff reductions had already been or will be made this year in anticipation of a recession, and the same percentage pointed to wage inflation as a factor in cuts. But in spite of the frequent and increasing recourse to quiet firing, its results received mixed reviews from survey respondents. A whopping 85 percent of participants called it a somewhat or very effective way of influencing employees to leave with lower costs and legal hassles. But 98 percent of respondents acknowledged the technique also had a negative effect on workplace morale, with nearly 40 percent describing that erosion as considerable.\n\nFor that reason alone, Julia Toothacre, ResumeTemplates\u2019 chief career strategist, warned that quiet firing is a double-edged sword employers should think entirely through before using. \u201cFrom a business perspective, quiet firing can seem like an efficient way to reduce head count without triggering layoffs, bad press, or severance costs,\u201d Toothacre said in comments about the survey\u2019s results. \u201cBut it\u2019s shortsighted. Creating an environment that pushes people to quit inevitably damages morale, productivity, and trust. It can also negatively impact hiring in the future. And let\u2019s be honest, when this tactic is applied broadly, companies risk losing high performers, not just underperformers.\u201d Another possible result is businesses not losing anyone at all. Survey respondents reported that employees targeted by quiet firing don\u2019t always quit as hoped \u2014 especially in an increasingly challenging labor market.\n\nIndeed, 77 percent of participants said some of their quiet-firing efforts had failed when workers decided that finding a new job elsewhere would be more arduous than roughing it out where they were. One reason for that fatalism, 53 percent of responding managers said in their rather depressing view of the modern workforce, is that a large number of current \u201cworkers simply tolerate poor treatment rather than quitting.\u201d That may wind up leaving manipulating executives with more than they bargained for. Because refusals of targeted employees to quit can have potentially negative consequences for the workplaces they remain in \u2014 and the employers who wanted them gone. \u201cMany workers will stick it out right now not because they\u2019re engaged, but because the job market feels uncertain,\u201d Toothacre said. \u201cThey\u2019re weighing the stress of a toxic workplace against the risk of landing a new job that pays less. This calculator puts employees in survival mode, which will ultimately impact productivity.\u201d",

      "text": "A new ResumeTemplates survey of 1,128 business leaders conducted in May 2025 reveals that quiet firing is a widespread workforce strategy this year. More than half of companies say they are either currently using or plan to use quiet firing \u2014 defined as pushing employees out through indirect means like benefit cuts, increased workloads, or mandating more office time.\nThe tactic is often used as an alternative to formal layoffs, allowing companies to trim staff without triggering severance payouts or damaging their public image. While many report it\u2019s effective, most also acknowledge a steep cost to employee morale.\nHighlights:\n- 53% of companies are quiet firing employees in 2025\n- Top tactics include delaying raises (47%), increasing required office days (42%), and cutting benefits (32%)\n- 41% say they use quiet firing to push out certain employees, and 32% are doing it to avoid bad press\n- Rising costs, including from tariffs, are driving the need for staff reductions\n- The majority of companies are also doing formal layoffs\n53% of Companies Will Engage in Quiet Firing This Year\nMore than half (53%) of companies say they are engaging in quiet firing in 2025 \u2014 42% have already started, and another 11% plan to do so later in the year.\nNearly half (47%) say quiet firing helps them more easily manage underperforming employees. Additionally, 41% are quiet firing because they want to push out certain employees, such as those who prefer remote work. Other motivations include avoiding severance payouts (34%), reducing legal risks (34%), and steering clear of bad press associated with formal layoffs (32%).\nTactics include delaying raises, increasing required in-office days, and cutting benefits\nTo encourage employees to quit voluntarily, 47% of companies say they are delaying promotions or raises. Additionally, 46% will enforce stricter rules or policies, and 45% will increase workloads without additional compensation. About 42% already are or plan to mandate more in-office days, and 35% will reduce pay or bonuses.\nMicromanaging employees (34%), cutting benefits (32%), and ignoring toxic workplace behavior (22%) are tactics that will also be used. A smaller percentage also have or plan to conduct formal layoffs to lower morale among remaining staff (21%).\nReduced Revenue and Tariff-Related Costs Drive Reasons for Cutting Staff\nThe leading reason companies cite for reducing staff is slowing revenue or sales (50%). Tariffs and increased trade costs follow closely at 46%. Roughly 39% anticipate a recession, and 39% cite wage inflation. About 31% say staff reductions are needed due to AI or automation replacing roles, 26% point to pressure from investors, and 25% cite rising real estate or facility costs.\nMost companies are making moderate staff reductions in 2025. About 15% are reducing staff by less than 5%. The largest share (40%) say they are cutting between 5% and 10% of their workforce, and another 28% report cuts between 11% and 25%. Roughly 11% say they are cutting 26% to 50% of employees, nearly 5% report cuts of 50% to 75%, and 2% say they are reducing staff by 76% or more.\n9 in 10 say it\u2019s reduced morale\nOf companies that started quiet firing in 2025, 39% say it has reduced morale a lot, and 46% say it has a little. Only 13% say it\u2019s had a minimal impact on morale, and 2% say it\u2019s had no impact at all.\n\u201cFrom a business perspective, quiet firing can seem like an efficient way to reduce headcount without triggering layoffs, bad press, or severance costs,\u201d says ResumeTemplates\u2019 Chief Career Strategist Julia Toothacre. \u201cBut it\u2019s short-sighted. Creating an environment that pushes people to quit inevitably damages morale, productivity, and trust. It can also negatively impact hiring in the future. And let\u2019s be honest, when this tactic is applied broadly, companies risk losing high performers, not just underperformers.\u201d\n85% Say Quiet Firing Has Been an Effective Tactic\nDespite the costs to morale, most companies that use quiet firing find it effective.\nAbout 27% say it\u2019s been very effective at reducing headcount, while 58% say it\u2019s somewhat effective. Among those who find it ineffective, the top reason is that employees stay because of a tough job market (77%). Additionally, more than half (53%) say workers simply tolerate poor treatment rather than quitting. Other challenges include legal or HR issues (20%) and manager reluctance to fully implement the strategy (13%).\n\u201cMany workers will stick it out right now not because they\u2019re engaged, but because the job market feels uncertain. They\u2019re weighing the stress of a toxic workplace against the risk of landing a new job that pays less. This calculator puts employees in survival mode, which will ultimately impact productivity,\u201d says Toothacre.\n6 in 10 Have Already Conducted Formal Layoffs in 2025\nQuiet firing isn\u2019t replacing layoffs entirely. Nearly 60% of companies say they have already conducted formal layoffs this year.\nLooking ahead, 34% say they plan to conduct layoffs regardless of how effective quiet firing is. Another 32% will only lay off employees if quiet firing fails. Eighteen percent say they have no plans for layoffs, while 15% say it depends on other factors.\nMethodology: This survey was conducted between May 20 and May 22, 2025. A total of 1,128 U.S. businesses participated. To ensure appropriate responses, participants were required to meet specific demographic criteria.\nResume Templates offers free, HR approved resume templates to help you create a professional resume in minutes.
