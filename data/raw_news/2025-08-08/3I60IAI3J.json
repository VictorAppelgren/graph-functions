  "title": "Stocks just broke through a key level that indicates a sell-off. Here's how much the S&P 500 will fall before you should buy, according to one strategist",
  "description": "The S&P 500 broke through a key resistance level that suggests a 5% pullback could be on its way, one strategist says.",
  "content": "\u2022 Stocks broke a key level that suggests a 5% sell-off is coming, BTIG's chief market technician says.\n\u2022 The S&P 500 saw resistance around 6,100 at the start of the year.\n\u2022 There are 4 reasons the index could retest that level, he added.\n\nThe stock market flashed a key technical signal that suggests a pullback from all-time highs is on the way.\n\nThat's according to Jonathan Krinsky, the managing director and chief market technician at BTIG, who thinks the S&P 500 is bound for a 5% pullback soon. The benchmark index just broke through a technical resistance level that suggests a retrenchment is likely, he said, speculating the index could fall to around 6,100 before investors have the opportunity to buy.\n\nThe S&P 500 saw technical resistance, a price ceiling where sellers are likely to step in and cause a pullback, at around the 6,100 mark in late January, Krinsky said. That was several months before Trump announced his tariffs and drove a steep decline in equities. The index then dropped around 20% from its February peak through the sell-off in early April, before breaking past the key 6,100 level again in late June.\n\n\"Typically, when you break through resistance, you do get a check back to kind of retest that support. And so we do think that's coming, into this August, September period,\" Krinsky said, speaking to CNBC this week. \"We think you'll get an opportunity to buy around 6,100.\"\n\nThere are a few signs that suggest that the stock market is looking vulnerable to a correction, Krinsky added. Here are some of the warning signs he sees:\n\nKrinsky pointed to potential vulnerabilities in consumer-facing sectors, like retail and transportation.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500, for instance, has been among the worst-performing areas of the market so far this year. Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 are down 0.43% since January, one of the only areas of the broader index in the red this year.\n\nOther market pros have said they're eyeing weakness in consumer stocks, pointing to the impact of tariffs on inflation and consumer spending.\n\n\"You're seeing some cracks under the surface,\" Krinsky said.\n\nHistorically, semiconductor stocks have lagged behind software stocks in the late summer, Krinsky said, adding that he believed many names in the semiconductor space also looked vulnerable to him.\n\nSome chipmakers' second-quarter earnings have been weaker than expected. Advanced Micro Devices missed slightly on earnings estimates for the quarter, while Super Micro Computer missed slightly on earnings and revenue.",

      "text": "- Nvidia's stock has more than doubled since the start of the year.\n- However, experts told Business Insider that the chip giant may not always be on the up and up.\n- Nvidia has to reckon with the cyclical nature of the industry and increased competition.\nRiding the AI wave has proven to be lucrative for Nvidia.\nNvidia stock prices have more than doubled since the start of the year, and in June, it briefly became the world's most valuable company.\nBut the company is unlikely to climb forever.\n\"The semiconductor sector has always been cyclical, so we should assume there will be ups and downs in the future too,\" said Chris Miller, a history professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University.\nMiller, who authored The New York Times bestseller \"Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology,\" told BI that chip giants like Nvidia and TSMC \"have benefited immensely from the AI buildout.\"\nThat, however, may not always be the case, he added.\n\"The boom in spending on AI infrastructure has been a major growth driver for the chip industry,\" Miller said. \"If excitement and investment in AI slow, chip industry growth will slow, too.\"\nWhat is the semiconductor supercycle?\nAt its core, a semiconductor supercycle simply means that there can be sustained periods of growth and increased demand \u2014 one that can last for several years.\nBut that rosy period of growth doesn't last forever. The capital-intensive nature of semiconductor manufacturing, for one, makes it extremely difficult to align supply with demand.\nAnd companies that want to meet a sudden uptick in demand must make hefty investments to boost production. While this would certainly raise supply levels, it also risks creating an oversupply if demand dies down.\nThis means that investors could be left hanging if they time the semiconductor supercycle wrongly.\nFor now, the chip industry has found itself buoyed by the surge in funding from AI-related investments.\nThat has resulted in a big payday for Nvidia, which has done brisk business with Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's Elon Musk.\nZuckerberg even touted Meta's growing stockpile of Nvidia chips in an interview with The Verge in January, adding that he expects the company to own more than 340,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by the end of 2024.\nHowever, some segments in the industry have already seen a slowdown, such as those relating to chips for consumer electronics. In April, chip manufacturer TSMC said it was lowering its growth forecasts, citing weak smartphone and personal computer sales.\nThe boom in data center builds has also spurred significant chip demand. If data center investment slows, chip firms could take a hit, Miller said.\nTo be sure, not everyone thinks we are at the peak of the AI-driven supercycle just yet.\n\"The rising demand for electricity due to digitalization, AI, and the use of renewable energies are increasing the demand for metal raw materials,\" Thomas Rupf, chief investment officer at private bank VP Bank in Asia, told BI.\n\"It is still too early to declare a new super cycle,\" he said, adding that there are still investment opportunities in areas like industrial metals and mining, both boosted by AI demand.\nJosie Ananto, a principal at EY-Parthenon's strategy and transactions team, told BI that the growing ubiquity of chips means that demand will be a lot more persistent.\n\"The growth of the semiconductor sector is not a hype \u2014 it is real,\" she said. \"For example, electric vehicles in the automotive sector, product innovation in life sciences and pharmaceutical sector, consumer recommendation and personalization in the consumer products and retail sector.\"\nHeightened competition will only make things harder for incumbents like Nvidia\nSemiconductor supercycle aside, investors may also want to pay attention to the competitive dynamics for chip designers like Nvidia.\n\"Nvidia today is the leader in producing chips for AI training and deployment,\" Miller said. \"However, Nvidia's success is already attracting competition.\"\nUnlike TSMC, Nvidia designs but doesn't make its own chips. This, Miller added, means that Nvidia is exposed to multiple threats \u2014 whether it be from Big Tech players like Meta and Google or startups like Groq.\n\"The barrier to entry for chip manufacturing is very high, given the significant capital investment required to open a fabrication plant,\" EY-Parthenon's Ananto said.\n\"For chip design, however, this is an area that is likely ripe for disruption, as more technology companies are investing in chip design capabilities, specifically tailored to their products with faster time to market,\" she added.\nAmazon, Meta, and Google are all designing their own AI chips.\nAnd Nvidia isn't standing still, either. In May, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company would release new chips on a \"one-year rhythm\" instead of its traditional two-year release cycle.\nBut that's not to say that firms will all be competing to feast on the same pie. According to Miller, the pie may be huge now, but there's no telling when it could shrink.\n\"The key question is how much Big Tech companies continue to spend building AI infrastructure,\" he said.\nAccording to a Goldman Sachs report published last month, tech companies are expected to pour over a trillion dollars into AI over the next few years.\nHowever, the investment bank cautioned against being overly optimistic about AI's return on investment, given how \"exceptionally expensive\" the technology is."

      "text": "- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are below their 200-day moving averages.\n- That's a key indicator for identifying the direction of long-term market trends.\n- One technical analyst is warning of a potential downtrend, with more headwinds next quarter.\nStocks are in a danger zone closely watched by technical analysts for signs of further weakness ahead.\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 have both been trading below their 200-day moving average, an important technical indicator that helps identify the long-term direction of a trend.\nWhen securities fall below this level, it sends a warning to traders that the prior uptrend in price could be on the verge of reversing course and establishing a downtrend.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have been trading below their respective 200-day moving averages since early March, and perhaps more importantly, they both retested the level and failed to climb back above it.\nThat trading behavior tracks with a key principle of technical analysis, which is that an old support level becomes the new resistance at the start of a downtrend.\nThe recent trading behavior solidifies the idea that the 200-day moving average is now acting as a resistance level for stocks.\nThe recent sell-off could also mark the start of a new downtrend, which is defined as a series of lower highs and lower lows.\nThat's not to say that the bull market is over. There have been plenty of head fakes for traders who are laser-focused on the 200-day moving average, including in March 2023 and November 2023, when the index briefly traded below the indicator but quickly recovered.\nBut the longer the index trades below the key level, the higher the likelihood that a new downtrend is in place.\nKatie Stockton, a closely followed technical analyst on Wall Street, told clients in a recent note that she expects the pain in stocks to continue.\n\"Our intermediate-term indicators suggest the correction will resume mid- to late April,\" Stockton said, adding that recent trading behavior in the Nasdaq suggests \"a challenging Q2.\""

      "text": "- The stock market is at risk of a near-term correction, an investment chief at Goldman Sachs says.\n- The firm's co-CIO of multi-asset solutions pointed to two warning signs that markets could be too frothy.\n- Others on Wall Street, including Stifel, Evercore ISI, and HSBC, have been warning of a coming correction.\nInvestor exuberance is high, but there's a pair of risks that could derail the latest rally to record highs.\nAlexnadria Wilson-Elizondo, the co-CIO of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs, said the bank was expecting the market to soon run into a correction. There are two warning signs that the market is flashing, she said, speaking to CNBC about her outlook on Tuesday.\n\"A little bit of a correction,\" Wilson-Elizondo said of the short-term. \"And it would be an opportunity for us to continue to add back into the portfolios.\"\nHere are the two warning signs she sees:\n1. High risk-appetite\nMarket sentiment has improved dramatically since President Donald Trump first unveiled his tariffs in April \u2014 but there are signs that investors are growing overly optimistic, Wilson-Elizondo said.\nAccording to a survey conducted by Bank of America, global fund managers' sentiment reading in July rose from 3.3 to 4.3. Investors are now the most positive about the market since February, when they were still feeling upbeat in the early days of Trump's second term.\nInvestors have also largely brushed off the risk of a recession. Fifty-nine percent of fund managers said they believed a global recession was unlikely, the most optimistic investors have felt about growth in about five months, the BofA survey found.\n\"When you look at fund manager surveys or risk appetite and sentiment, things have shot up to record-highs in three months. So really quickly, tactically people have re-invested,\" Wilson-Elizondo said.\n2. Retail's stock buying boom\nRetail investors have been ultra-bullish on stocks, aggressively buying the post-Liberation Day dip in equities.\nWilson-Elizondo said retail investors purchased around $50 billion worth of stocks over the last month, in-line with estimates from Barclays released on Tuesday.\nIn a note earlier this month, JPMorgan estimated that retail investors purchased a net $270 billion worth of stocks over the first six months of the year, and were on track to buy a net $360 billion in the second half.\n\"It's coming in at much higher levels than it has in the past,\" Goldman's Wilson-Elizondo said of retail activity. \"And in our minds, that's very vulnerable to changes in the labor market.\"\nThe job market has remained resilient, but there are signs that hiring is beginning to slow, Goldman strategists wrote on Tuesday. The bank pointed to the slowdown in private job gains and said the job market risked hitting \"stall speed\" if the economy continued to slow \u2014 a situation where jobs growth is so week, it creates a \"self-reinforcing rise in unemployment,\" they added.\n\"There's a very high correlation between the labor market and the willingness to be invested in risky assets,\" Wilson-Elizondo added.\nStill, Wilson-Elizondo said she remains bullish on the outlook for stocks over the long term. She pointed to a cocktail of bullish factors that could help stock prices tread higher past 2025:\n- Monetary policy. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates down the line, which should loosen financial conditions and offer a boost to risk assets. Investors are pricing in a 93% chance the Fed will cut rates anywhere from one to three times by the end of 2025, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n- Trump's tax bill. The GOP tax and spending bill, which includes some stimulus measures and offers tax breaks to key businesses, is also expected to help juice the market, Wilson-Elizondo said.\nTalk of a pullback has been swirling on Wall Street since major indexes climbed back to record highs. Evercore ISI, Stifel, Pimco, and HSBC are among the firms that have recently flagged the risk of a stock correction."

      "text": "- The S&P 500 is nearing two key resistance levels that could give way to more volatility and selling.\n- The index's rally faces challenges at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.\n- Potential market catalysts include Q1 GDP, the April jobs report, and first-quarter earnings.\nBreadth thrust buy signals? Check. A collapse in volatility? Check.\nTo many chart readers, it seemed like the latest technical signals were pointing to a fresh and lasting upswing in the stock market \u2014 but not so fast.\nThe S&P 500 is approaching key resistance levels that could unleash a wave of selling and increase volatility in the near term.\nSince the benchmark index rallied 14% from tariff-induced lows earlier this month, it is fast approaching its declining 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average.\nWhen the stock market is in a downtrend, as it has been since it made a series of lower highs and lower lows in March and April, the declining moving averages typically represent a level where sellers can overwhelm buyers, driving stock prices lower and extending the downtrend.\n\"We favor the 200-day average as a gauge of the market's primary trend,\" Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., told Business Insider on Tuesday. \"It often serves as support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends.\"\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the 50-day moving average of 5,613 represents 1.2% upside from current levels, while the 200-day moving average of 5,746 represents 3.6% upside.\nBut from there, it will likely be a tougher hill to climb for the stock market.\n\"The key question we're focused on is whether the first-quarter weakness was simply a sharp correction within an ongoing bull cycle, or the start of a more extended consolidation following a meaningful trend break,\" Wald said.\n\"We lean toward the latter view, and believe the risk/reward profile becomes less attractive as the S&P 500 approaches its 200-day moving average,\" He added.\nWhats more, the S&P 500's 200-day moving average is around the same level where the market peaked in late March, representing yet another reason why selling could take place around 5,750.\n\"The S&P 500 is reaching a 'confluence of resistance' formed by the 200-day moving average as well as the late March swing low around 5750,\" David Keller, chief strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, told BI.\n\"Given the severity of the upswing, we would expect at least a tactical pullback from this resistance zone as the market digests recent gains,\" he said.\nFor Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, the 50-day moving average is a key resistance level to watch in the coming trading days.\nAnd she thinks the stock market will be able to break above it.\n\"Our market internals are supportive of a bigger rebound,\" Stockton told clients in a note on Monday. \"Sentiment has recovered meaningfully per the Fear & Greed Index, which is back above 25% after becoming deeply oversold earlier this month.\"\nHowever, according to Stockton, a break above the S&P 500's 50-day moving average would likely be short-lived and ultimately give way to renewed weakness.\n\"Both the SPX and Nasdaq-100 Index have room to initial resistance at their 50-day MAs, respectively 5625 and 19680, breakouts above which would likely foster additional momentum before the rally fails,\" she said.\nBig stock market catalysts ahead\nAs to what could cause a new wave of selling in the stock market, it could be investors' reaction to a flurry of upcoming data.\nInvestors will get a first glimpse at first-quarter GDP on Wednesday along with an update to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Those data points will by followed by the April jobs report on Friday. On May 7, investors will hear from Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, which could include a shift in the central bank's view of interest rates.\nIn between all of the macroeconomic updates, first-quarter earnings season will be in full swing, with most mega-cap tech giants set to report results in the next few days."

Sanders left an executive position at Fairchild Semiconductor with several other frustrated employees to start AMD. Intel, AMD\u2019s main rival in the CPU space, also was founded by a frustrated former Fairchild executive. (read more)\nThe company went public in September of 1972. AMD issued 620,000 shares of common stock for $15.50 per share, equivalent to $0.57 adjusted for the 27:1 spilt over the lifetime of the stock. It raised $7.5 million in its initial, over the counter public offering. AMD moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1979, and to the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in 2015.\nIn 1977, Siemens bought 20% of AMD\u2019s outstanding shares in order to increase its American microprocessor footprint, but sold the shares back to AMD just two years later.\nIn 1984, after the company had decided to enter a joint technology exchange with Intel primarily to produce its rival\u2019s x86 chips, the company landed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.\nAMD bought ATI Technologies in 2006 for $5.4 billion in order to expand its graphics card capabilities.\nThe company spun off its manufacturing division in a joint venture with the government of Abu Dhabi in 2008. The spun off company, GlobalFoundries, would allow AMD to focus exclusively on its chip design.\nAMD split its stock several times over the history of the company. It performed a 2:1 split in 1980, a 3:2 split in 1982, a 2:1 split in 1983 and a 2:1 split in 2000.\nIt reached its all-time high of $48.50 per share in 2000, and its all time low in 2015 at $1.61.\n| Name | Job |\n|---|---|\n| Lisa T.

      "text": "- Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson thinks the market's best buying opportunity lies in a few areas.\n- He pointed to underperforming areas of the market, like housing, commodities, and consumer goods.\n- Those sectors could soon see a turnaround, he said, pointing to two catalysts on the horizon.\nThe brightest spot in the stock market could be the place investors least expect.\nThat's according to Mike Wilson, the chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, who thinks he's identified the biggest buying opportunity in stocks: the areas that have lagged behind the broader market so far this year.\nSpeaking to Bloomberg on Wednesday, Wilson pointed to areas like housing, commodities, consumer goods, and small caps, which have all underperformed the broader market this year.\nThose areas have struggled in part because the economy looks like it was going through a rolling recession, Wilson said, referring to a downturn that spreads through various sectors one at a time.\nBut the story for these laggards could change soon for two reasons, in his view.\n1. Improving earnings revisions\nWilson said Morgan Stanley had been bullish on the financials, industrials, and software sectors since April of this year, due to expectations of strong earnings revisions breadth. That's played out well so far, with the financials, industrials, and tech sectors of the S&P 500 up year-to-date.\n\"At the end of the day, I do think the biggest opportunity going forward is the areas that have not seen those revisions yet,\" Wilson said.\nStocks in the housing, commodities, and consumer goods sectors and small-cap stocks have been rattled this year, in large part due to higher interest rates and concerns swirling around President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nThe consumer goods sector, in particular, is likely going to feel the impact of tariffs soon, Wilson said \u2014 but that only adds to his bull case.\n\"So, in the very short term, we actually think revision breadth could come down a bit as some of these tariffs flow through the cost of goods sold. But that's just going to create the next buying opportunity,\" he added.\n2. Fed rate cuts incoming\nMarkets are also expecting a slew of Fed rate cuts over the near-to-medium term, which should help some of the market's laggards.\nWilson said Morgan Stanley expected the Fed to remain pat on a rate cut through the rest of 2025, but trim interest rates as much as seven times in 2026. Investors, meanwhile, are expecting rate cuts even sooner, with markets pricing in a 93% chance the Fed could cut rates by a quarter-point in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\"I mean, that's like wildish bullish for equities, okay? So, you know, you almost have the perfect set-up,\" Wilson said, adding that areas like small-caps, which are rate-sensitive, will \"love\" the easing of monetary policy.\nWilson, who remained bearish on stocks in recent years before flipping his stance in 2024, has had his eye set on various buying opportunities in the market his year. In July, he said any dips in the market could represent prime opportunities for investors to load up on stocks, and forecast the S&P 500 to end the year around 6,500, around 2% higher than the index's current levels."

      "text": "- Katie Stockton founded Fairlead Strategies and is a technical analysis expert, with over 20 years of experience on Wall Street.\n- Stockton shares the secret behind her methodology and as well as 3 top indicators she watches.\n- She explains why the charts signal ether is gearing up to outperform bitcoin.\n- See more stories on Insider's business page.\nTechnical analysis really resonated with Katie Stockton, the moment legendary technical analyst Ralph Acampora ripped up the Wall Street Journal in front of her class at the University of Richmond.\nAcampora said, \"you don't need this anymore\" as he ripped up the Journal.\nHis message was that price tells you everything, Stockton said.\nThis made sense to Stockton who found it hard to argue with the math behind the models and mathematically driven technical indicators.\n\"To me that was a really good, unbiased way to approach the markets and that's where my passion developed,\" Stockton said.\nMore than 20 years on from learning about technical analysis at college, Stockton has also become a legend in the world of technical analysis. She was the youngest female to receive the CMT charter in 2001, spent years on Wall Street as a chief market technician at leading firms and frequently talks shop on top business networks, such as CNBC and Bloomberg.\nIn 2018, Stockton struck it out on her own founding Fairlead Strategies, a firm providing technical strategy research to both institutional and retail clients on assets from equities to commodities to even cryptocurrencies.\nWhat is technical analysis and why use it?\nTechnical analysis is the discipline of evaluating trading and investment opportunities through examining patterns and trends in charts.\nIt's an incredibly broad subject area with technical indicators ranging from trendlines to moving averages and momentum indicators.\n\"For my methodology, it really only scratches the surface as to what technical analysis has to offer in terms of different indicators and approaches and tools,\" Stockton said. \" ... I try to explain to [groups I speak to] that this is a technical analysis, as I use it, but there's a whole world out there.\"\nEach of Stockton's clients use charts in their own way.\n\"What I think is a theme is that the folks that have success with it tend to have discipline,\" Stockton said.\nThere's no holy grail in one indicator, Stockton said. It's about how investors and traders combine the indicators, a lot of times it's about keeping it simple and not having too much duplication across indicators, she said.\n\"You don't need 10 moving averages to give you a sense of prevailing trends and support and resistance, two should be sufficient,\" Stockton said.\nWith too many indicators or tools there's risk for confirmation bias, especially if technical analysis is not an investor's primary discipline, Stockton said. But the benefits can be huge as technical analysis can act as a filter \u2014 helping investors have confidence in whether a market move is important or just noise.\nStockton's secret sauce\nStockton's process has developed over her 20-plus year career and it's the tools that resonated most with her that have then become part of her daily toolkit.\n\"Our primary goal [is in] identifying key levels that [investors] can also watch themselves, and key risk metrics and trying to help people add to their own process,\" Stockton said.\nThere are three main types of indicator that Stockton uses: momentum, overbought/oversold and relative strength.\nAnd her approach is top-down and bottom-up. This involves looking at major indices and internal measures, such as market breadth and sentiment, but also looking at the underlying components of the indices. Often, the S&P 500 won't tell the whole story, Stockton said.\nHere are her must-watch indicators:\n1) MACD (Moving average convergence divergence)\nThis indicator shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. A signal line is plotted, which can function as a buy- and sell-signal.\nStockton uses MACD to capture momentum and trend across multiple timeframes. The indicator appeals to her because it's very black and white, either a buy, or a sell.\n2) Stochastic Oscillator\nThis is an indicator within the overbought/oversold category. It compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a period of time.\n\"I use the stochastics to help enhance whether we know what the prevailing trend is, are there any signs of exhaustion to the upside, or to the downside?\" Stockton said.\n3) Price-to-price ratios\nPrice-to-price ratios falls into the relative strength category and are often used alongside indicators, such as moving averages, or DeMark indicators, which are used to measure underlying demand for an asset and get a sense of directional bias, Stockton said.\nCrypto outlook\nRecently, Stockton has become a go-to source for her cryptocurrency analysis, which she started providing in March 2020.\nDespite the fairly new addition, she's actually been researching the subject for years. She started writing the research when she became confident in how applicable traditional indicators were.\nThe focus in the crypto markets this week has been on a major upgrade to the ethereum network, known as the London hard fork, which initally led to a surge in the value of ether on Thursday.\nStockton's analysis of the technicals shows bitcoin is losing strength relative to ether, which is signalling a switch to a risk-on environment in which cryptocurrencies generally tend to rally.\nIn this environment, Stockton expects ether to outperform bitcoin, as individuals tend to feel more comfortable investing and trading ether when the whole crypto market is rallying.\n\"It's very important to be watching them every day for these levels, for these important hurdles, because breakouts tend to be very actionable in this space as do breakdowns,\" Stockton said."

      "text": "- The stock market has been buoyed by strong corporate earnings.\n- Of the firms that have reported results, 82% have beaten estimates.\n- Here are key takeaways for investors from recent earnings.\nCompanies have reported mostly strong second-quarter earnings so far, but there are some specific takeaways investors should be aware of.\nSo far, 82% of companies that have reported results have beaten estimated. According to FactSet, if that percentage holds, it will represent the highest percentage of quarterly earnings beats since the third quarter of 20221.\nEarnings will continue rolling in over the coming weeks, with tech titan Nvidia set to report at the end of August.\nUntil then, here are some key insights from the last results:\nAMD & Super Micro: Trump's trade policy is hitting the semiconductor sector\nWhat happened: Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both reported earnings for the second quarter on Tuesday, with mixed results.\nAMD beat on revenue, but missed earnings estimates slightly. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.48, a hair below the expected $0.49 a share.\nLisa Su, AMD's CEO, said the firm's AI revenue declined on a year-over-year basis largely due to US export restrictions, which have prevented AMD from selling its MI308 AI chip to China.\nShares were down as much as 8% on Wednesday.\nSuper Micro, meanwhile, missed slightly on both earnings and revenue. The chipmaker said revenue came in at $5.76 billion, below the expected $5.89 billion, and earnings per share came in at $0.41, below the $0.44 Wall Street expected.\nThe miss was partly fueled by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, Charles Liang, the CEO, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday.\nShares of the chipmaker were down 17% after the results.\nWhat it means: AI chip manufacturers are caught in the crossfire of the trade war. That's expected to remain a key concern as the US irons out the details of its trade relationship with China.\nThe US and China have until August 12 to strike a trade deal before higher tariffs kick in, another headwind that could rattle the market and semiconductor stocks in particular.\n\"Industry-wide tariff impact is only now being felt and could result in headwinds for the entire semiconductor industry,\" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, wrote in a note.\nMcDonald's: US consumers are in a precarious position\nWhat happened: McDonald's beat on earnings and revenue expectations for the quarter, but voiced concerns about the health of lower-income consumers and the ability of Americans to keep spending.\nThe fast food franchise said revenue came in at $6.84 billion for the quarter, above the $6.7 billion analysts expected. Earnings per share came in at an adjusted $3.19, above estimates of $3.15.\n\"Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical,\" Chris Kempczinski, the CEO, said on the company's earnings call, adding that low-income Americans were more likely to visit the chain than other income groups. \"This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the US consumer.\"\nWhat it means: Consumer spending is in focus for retail giants and for Wall Street, given the cumulative effects of inflation in recent years and Trump's tariffs.\nEconomists say tariffs could stoke inflation, as companies can pass along the cost of import duties to consumers. For now, though spending remains fairly strong, even as concerns have risen recently around a pullback among both high and low-income households.\nPalantir: Hype for AI still strong\nWhat happened: Palantir blew past estimates for second quarter earnings. The data software firm revealed that its revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, reflecting a 55% year-over-year increase.\nShares popped as much as 10% after its results, bringing the stock up 130% year-to-date.\nWhat it means: The AI trade is alive and well, with firms still benefitting from the hype for artificial intelligence.\nWedbush Securities called Palantir the \"Messi of AI\" in a note to clients shortly after the firm reported earnings. In a separate note, analysts lifted their price target for the stock to $200 a share, implying 15% upside from current levels.\n\"Palantir remains one of our top tech names to own in 2025 and this deal represents another opportunity for PLTR to capitalize on while continuing to generate unprecedented traction for its entire portfolio across the federal and commercial landscapes,\" analysts said.\nMicrosoft and Meta: Mega-cap tech still dominates\nWhat happened: Microsoft and Meta both beat on earnings last week.\nMicrosoft took in $76.4 billion in revenue and $3.65 in earnings per share, above estimates of $73.8 billion and $3.37 a share. The company also joined the $4 trillion club for the first time as its stock surged following its earnings report, with shares up 26% year-to-date.\nMeta, meanwhile, took in $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 in earnings per share, above estimates of $44.83 billion and $5.89 a share. The stock is up 27% year-to-date.\nWhat it means: Mega-cap tech is still dominating the market.\nTech was best-performing area of the S&P 500 in July, with the sector up 5% in the month. The Nasdaq hit 14 record highs in July, causing Deutsche Bank to declare that \"tech-ceptionalism\" has resumed for the market.\nThe strong outperformance of large-cap stocks accelerated, further widening the gap between small-cap peers.\n\"We continue to favor US large cap Tech over its small cap counterpart, as it takes a highly speculative market (i.e. 2021) or Big Tech to fall out of favor (i.e. 2022, Q4 2024) for the latter to outperform,\" Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of the research firm DataTrek, wrote in a note."
