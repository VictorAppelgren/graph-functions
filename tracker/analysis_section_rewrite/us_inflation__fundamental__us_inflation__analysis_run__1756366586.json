      "feedback": "**Actionable edit plan (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Re‑frame the structure**: split the draft into three logical blocks—(i) Fed policy & crypto, (ii) Brazil soy moratorium, (iii) AI‑driven job loss/UBI—then weave a single causal chain that links each block to macro variables (real‑rate differential, terms‑of‑trade, productivity, BoP, net external position).  \n2. **Anchor on first‑principles**: explicitly state that Fed cuts lower real rates (source OGK8WLL69), tightening the US real‑rate differential relative to Brazil, which weakens the dollar but boosts commodity‑linked asset prices.  Note that Brazil’s soy export surge (97 Mt Jan‑Nov 2024, source J54PXL0NV) improves its BoP and raises terms‑of‑trade, while the moratorium’s 69 % deforestation cut (source J54PXL0NV) tightens supply and supports prices.  AI displacement (25 % of US jobs at risk, source 1GVYF2V8O) reduces aggregate demand, compressing commodity demand and offsetting the supply‑side pressure.  \n3. **Add specificity and numbers**: cite Fed rate range (4.25‑4.5 % per source OGK8WLL69), crypto peak ($4,955, source OGK8WLL69), soy export volume (97 Mt, source J54PXL0NV), 25 % job exposure (source 1GVYF2V8O), and 344 % soy cultivation growth (source J54PXL0NV).  \n4. **Clarify policy reaction functions**: explain that the Fed’s reaction function is to raise rates to curb inflation; the current dovish stance signals a shift to cuts, lowering real rates and inflating asset prices.  \n5. **Define regimes & transition conditions**: risk‑on regime persists if Fed continues to signal cuts, crypto ETF inflows stay robust, and Brazil’s moratorium remains; transition to risk‑off if Fed reverses, AI job loss accelerates, or crypto regulators clamp down.  \n6. **Identify catalysts & invalidators**: Fed speech (source OGK8WLL69) and crypto ETF inflows are catalysts; Fed rate hikes, AI acceleration, or a crypto crackdown are invalidators.  \n7. **Re‑write the base‑case, risks, watch‑signals, and confidence**: keep the same core content but structure it as bullet points, each with a source ID, and use precise language (“Fed cuts lower real rates → dollar weakens → asset prices rise” instead of vague “risk‑on rally”).  \n8. **Ensure citation density**: every factual claim (e.g., 97 Mt export, 69 % deforestation reduction, 25 % job exposure) must carry a source ID; remove generic statements that lack citations.  \n9. **Correct misstatements**: replace “strengthening the dollar” with “weakening the dollar” when real rates fall; clarify that crypto’s rise is driven by regulatory tailwinds (SEC Project Crypto, Trump order) and institutional treasury flows (source OGK8WLL69).  \n10. **Add a concise conclusion**: summarize the net external position impact (US dollar likely weakens from lower real rates, but commodity demand may offset), and state confidence as “moderate‑high” with explicit caveats.  \n\nImplementing these edits will transform the draft into a world‑class, first‑principles‑driven, multi‑year structural analysis that meets the specified format and depth requirements.",
