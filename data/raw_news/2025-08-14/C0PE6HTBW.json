  "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Columbia University reached a landmark deal with the Trump administration to restore federal funding for research, easing a crisis that has rattled the school\u2019s finances and upended its leadership.\n\u2022 Trump Awards $1.26 Billion Contract to Build Biggest Immigrant Detention Center in US\n\u2022 The High Costs of Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Beautiful\u2019 New Car Loan Deduction The Ivy League school will pay a $200 million penalty over three years to resolve multiple civil rights investigations, clearing the way for the reinstatement of the majority of more than $400 million in canceled grants and contracts, as well as access to billions of dollars in future grants. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle claims that Jewish faculty and staff faced unlawful workplace discrimination following the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, according to the agreement. Columbia also made a series of commitments intended to increase transparency and compliance with federal civil rights law, and said it would strengthen its oversight of international students and bolster campus safety. The requirements highlight a new era of federal scrutiny of higher education in the US, with little assurance that the pressure is over. While the deal gives Columbia immediate relief from the Trump administration\u2019s hardball tactics, it leaves open the possibility of renewed investigations or future funding freezes. It also imposes years of oversight by a jointly approved resolution monitor, who will mediate complaints and receive regular reports from the university. The terms amount to a sweeping set of commitments for a school that, in the text of the agreement, denied any wrongdoing \u2014 and a potential sign of a continuing role the Trump administration may play in shaping university policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen with this administration that no decision is permanent,\u201d said Marcel Agueros, an astronomy professor at Columbia and the secretary of the university\u2019s chapter of the American Association of University Professors. Columbia\u2019s deal will potentially act as a template for other colleges negotiating with the US government, including Harvard University, which has also been hit by a flurry of actions cutting off funding and targeting its ability to enroll foreign students. Robert Kelchen, a professor of educational leadership and policy studies at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, said the agreement \u201cincreases the pressure on other universities\u201d to settle.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday on social media that deals with other schools are \u201cupcoming.\u201d Columbia has been at the center of controversy since pro-Palestinian protests roiled its New York City campus over the war in Gaza following the Oct. 7 attack. Lawmakers hammered the school for fostering antisemitism on its campus, but after President Donald Trump was elected to a second term, criticisms broadened to include efforts to promote diversity and objections to the number of foreign students admitted to campus. Foreigners make up almost 40% of the New York school\u2019s student body and contribute a significant portion of its revenue. In March, multiple federal agencies canceled more than 300 grants and contracts to researchers at Columbia as a result of its \u201ccontinued inaction\u201d in the face of a surge in complaints of antisemitism from Jewish students. Columbia said in a statement Wednesday that under the deal, paused payments on active research will be reinstated, including grants from the National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThe settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track,\u201d said Acting Columbia President Claire Shipman in a statement. \u201cImportantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.\u201d In a letter to students and staff on Wednesday night, Shipman highlighted the agreement\u2019s assurances that the government would have no authority to dictate faculty hiring, admissions decisions or permitted academic speech and classroom topics. \u201cThe federal government will not dictate what we teach, who teaches, or which students we admit,\u201d she wrote. Still, Agueros said that he had \u201cvery mixed feelings\u201d about the settlement, but that chief among them was \u201cdemoralization.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to feel like we have just caved to the bullying of this administration, which has now seen that it can in fact successfully use these tools to make a private university follow its wishes,\u201d Agueros said. The broad turmoil at Columbia since 2023 has contributed to the departures of president Minouche Shafik and interim leader Katrina Armstrong, who resigned in March after she appeared on a Zoom call with faculty to downplay reforms agreed with the White House. Armstrong had agreed to a partial ban on masks, increased policing on campus and oversight of Columbia\u2019s Middle East studies department. Under the final agreement, the university will share more detailed information with federal agencies about hiring and admissions decisions, restructure how it oversees student protests, and tighten rules against disruptive or masked demonstrations. The deal also requires a review of Columbia\u2019s regional programs, beginning with those related to the Middle East. Oversight of the agreement will be handled by resolution monitor Bart Schwartz, the founder of Guidepost Solutions, and an administrator. Columbia will also strengthen its oversight of international students by assessing applicants\u2019 reasons for studying in the US, sharing data with the federal government, and reducing the school\u2019s financial dependence on foreign students. A senior White House official described the $21 million payment for workplace discrimination claims as the largest public employment-discrimination settlement in nearly two decades, and the biggest ever tied to antisemitism or for workers of any religion. Columbia agreed to the arrangement following a government probe that found the Ivy League school violated federal civil rights law by acting \u201cwith deliberate indifference\u201d toward the harassment of its Jewish students. The deal \u201cis an important recognition of what Jewish students and their families have expressed with increasing urgency: antisemitism on campus is real, and it has had a tangible impact on Jewish students\u2019 sense of safety and belonging and, in turn, their civil rights,\u201d Brian Cohen, executive director at Columbia\u2019s Kraft Center for Jewish Student Life, said in an email. \u201cI am hopeful that today\u2019s agreement marks the beginning of real, sustained change.\u201d In a post on X, Columbia University Apartheid Divest \u2014 a coalition of pro-Palestinian student groups behind the campus protests \u2014 denounced the school for \u201cselling your students out.\u201d Earlier this month, the school said it would adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism and pledged to appoint coordinators to respond to and report allegations of civil rights violations. The school also said it would partner with Jewish organizations for mandatory anti-discrimination training. \u201cColumbia\u2019s reforms are a roadmap for elite universities that wish to regain the confidence of the American public by renewing their commitment to truth-seeking, merit, and civil debate,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cI believe they will ripple across the higher education sector and change the course of campus culture for years to come.\u201d\n\u2022 Elon Musk\u2019s Empire Is Creaking Under the Strain of Elon Musk\n\u2022 It\u2019s Not Just Tokyo and Kyoto: Tourists Descend on Rural Japan\n\u2022 What the Tough Job Market for New College Grads Says About the Economy",
