  "content": "Controversial former Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has been tapped by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to serve as his chief economic adviser.\n\nShafik infamously resigned from her role as Columbia\u2019s president in 2024 after her testimony in front of Congress sparked intense backlash. The university became a hotspot for anti-Israel protests on American college campuses following the start of the Israel-Hamas War on Oct. 7, 2023, and Shafik was questioned for allowing several antisemitic incidents to continue.\n\n\u201cBaroness (Minouche) Shafik is a world leading economist, whose career has straddled public policy and academia,\u201d Starmer\u2019s press release announcing the decision reads. \u201cThis role and the additional expertise will support the Government to go further and faster in driving economic growth and raising living standards for all.\u201d\n\nProtesters at Columbia held weeks-long encampments and even took over a campus building, during which a university employee was allegedly held hostage. The Ivy League school failed to discipline more than 100 protesters involved in the events until more than a year later, and despite New York police making dozens of arrests, many of the charges were eventually dropped. The intensity of the demonstrations even forced the university to shift instruction online in order to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the situation. (RELATED: Columbia University Drops Hammer On Anti-Israel Demonstrators A Year After \u2018Disruptions\u2019)\n\nAdministrators at Columbia were even caught championing the pro-Palestinian protesters efforts in private messages, admitting they hoped to strike an \u201camazing\u201d deal for them.\n\nShafik previously served in several financial roles, including under the United Kingdom government as the Permanent Secretary of the Department for International Development. She also served as the Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England.\n\nIn its coverage of the Prime Minister\u2019s appointment, The Associated Press failed to mention the controversy surrounding Shafik\u2019s exit from Columbia, stating only that the former president \u201cleft her job \u2026 following scrutiny of her handling of protests and campus divisions over the Israel-Hamas war.\u201d The outlet boiled down the multi-month stranglehold protesters had on the university to simply an issue of Shafik facing criticism from students for \u201cher decision to invite police in to arrest protesters\u201d and from \u201cRepublicans in Congress and others [who] called on her to do more to call out antisemitism.\u201d\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The New York Police Department has since dropped the charges and 38 of the students remain in \u201cgood standing,\u201d with the remaining two on disciplinary probation from prior hearings.\nAnother incident in which students allowed unauthorized individuals access to a university building and \u201cendangered other University students\u201d resulted in no disciplinary action due to \u201cinsufficient evidence to hold student accountable,\u201d the report stated. The report often cites \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d as the reason behind the lack of discipline.\n\u201cFollowing the disruptions of the last academic year, Columbia immediately began disciplinary processes, including with immediate suspensions,\u201d a Columbia spokesperson said, according to Inside Higher Ed. \u201cThe disciplinary process is ongoing for many students involved in these disruptions, including some of those who were arrested, and we have been working to expedite the process for this large volume of violations.\u201d\nThe committee started its investigation of the university in February but claims Columbia has not been fully compliant in sending over the required documents, according to a letter sent to the university in August.

Around 80 students were arrested at the time of the disruptive takeover, which occurred during the university\u2019s finals week, and other demonstrations at the university resulted in hundreds more arrests following violent clashes with police.

While the university later stated during negotiations with the Trump administration that it had punished several students for their involvement in the events, Columbia refused at the time to tell the Daily Caller News Foundation how many students were facing disciplinary action.\nThe Trump administration revoked $400 million from Columbia in March over allegations the Ivy League school failed to address antisemitism on campus and allowed for the repeated harassment of Jewish students. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in May said Columbia \u201cfailed\u201d to adhere to its own policies regarding responding to complaints from Jewish students and enforcing punishments and acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d towards antisemitism.\nColumbia has since promised compliance with the administration\u2019s demands and has adopted several changes regarding how it handles discrimination, including redefining antisemitism to prevent virtually any criticism of Jews and Israel.

The allegations in the report that the University ever seriously considered hiring an \u2018anti-Zionist\u2019 rabbi or boycotting any Israeli company are patently false.\u201d\nColumbia\u2019s leaders meanwhile drafted a \u201cmenu\u201d of options to concede to each of the protesters demands, including providing amnesty to many of the students involved in the encampment that overtook the campus for weeks, formally reviewing divestment demands from protesters, funding scholarships for students in Gaza and the West Bank, and creating a $10 million \u201cresilience fund\u201d for Gaza. Administrators also approved of a program in collaboration with a Palestinian university in which \u201cHamas is active on campus.\u201d\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik continued to negotiate with protesters even after they illegally overtook a campus building and allegedly held an employee hostage, the report found. Shafik resigned from the university shortly after her testimony to Congress in which she failed to state whether calling for genocide of Jews violated university policy.\n\u201cColumbia strongly condemns antisemitism and all forms of discrimination, and we are resolute that calls for violence or harm have no place at our University,\u201d a Columbia spokesperson told the DCNF. \u201cUnder the University\u2019s new leadership, we have established a centralized Office of Institutional Equity to address all reports of discrimination and harassment, appointed a new Rules Administrator, and strengthened the capabilities of our Public Safety Office. We are committed to applying the rules fairly, consistently, and efficiently.\u201d\nProtests at Columbia resulted in several arrests after altercations with police became violent. Many of the students were never punished for their involvement.\nNorthwestern and Columbia\u2019s presidents were both called to testify before Congress during a hearing on campus antisemitism after which the House Committee opened the formal investigation into the universities and several others for their failure to punish students involved in antisemitic incidents.\n\u201cThe University objects to the unfair characterizations of our Provost and valued members of our faculty based on isolated and out-of-context communications,\u201d Yates said. \u201cThe University unequivocally stands behind them and their work on behalf of our students, and their hard work to successfully bring our encampment to a swift and peaceful end.\u201d\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It\u2019s part of a staff shakeup aimed at strengthening the government\u2019s response to a sluggish economy and a heated political debate over immigration.\nStarmer\u2019s center-left Labour Party government has struggled to boost economic growth and curb inflation, leaving Treasury chief Rachel Reeves facing unpalatable choices about taxes and spending in her budget this fall.\nShafik, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, has held senior academic and civil service roles in Britain, and served a brief, tempestuous term as Columbia president. The British-U.S. national left her job leading the New York university in August 2024 after just over a year following scrutiny of her handling of protests and campus divisions over the Israel-Hamas war.\nLike other U.S. university leaders, Shafik faced criticism from many corners: Some students groups blasted her decision to invite police in to arrest protesters. Republicans in Congress and others called on her to do more to call out antisemitism.\nStarmer spokesman Dave Pares said the prime minister was delighted to have Shafik bring her \u201cexceptional record when it comes to economic expertise\u201d to the government.\nStarmer also shook up his communications team and appointed Darren Jones, formerly a minister in the Treasury, to the new post of chief secretary to the prime minister, tasked with coordinating work on policy priorities.\nThe moves came as lawmakers returned to Parliament after a summer break that saw dozens of small but heated protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers. The Labour government, which was elected in July 2024, has struggled to curb unauthorized migration and fulfill its responsibility to accommodate those seeking refuge.\nThe hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage has sought to capitalize on concern about thousands of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats. Painting the asylum-seekers as a threat, Farage has pledged to deport everyone who enters the country without authorization should Reform win power in a future election.\nReform has only a handful of lawmakers in the House of Commons but regularly leads both Labour and the main opposition Conservative Party in opinion polls.\nStarmer\u2019s government says it is fixing an asylum system broken after 14 years of Conservative government and is working with other countries to tackle the people-smuggling gangs that organize the cross-channel journeys. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told lawmakers on Monday that Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency and European partners had squeezed the supply of boats and engines destined for the French coast.\nCooper said the U.K. has a \u201clong and proud history\u201d of welcoming people in need, and claimed Reform UK was making \u201cfantasy promises which can\u2019t be delivered.\u201d But she also said the government would toughen some of its rules, making it harder for refugees to bring relatives to Britain."
