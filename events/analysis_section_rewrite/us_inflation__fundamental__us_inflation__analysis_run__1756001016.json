      "feedback": "**Feedback for a world‑class rewrite**\n\n1. **Anchor the narrative in first‑principles** – start with the *structural drivers* that will shape the U.S. equity market over the next 5–10 years: (a) the real‑rate differential between the U.S. and peers, (b) the terms‑of‑trade shift toward digital services, (c) the productivity‑boost from AI‑enabled cloud, (d) the balance‑of‑payments pressure from EV imports, and (e) the policy reaction function of the Fed and Treasury on tax‑credit policy.  Use these anchors to explain *why* Microsoft, Shopify, Rivian, and Tesla are positioned differently, rather than simply citing growth numbers.\n\n2. **Quantify every claim** – replace vague “strong growth” with concrete ranges: e.g., Microsoft’s Azure revenue grew 39 % YoY to $30 bn (source 0G3A676BP), Shopify’s net income rose 5‑fold to $906 m (source 0G3A676BP), Rivian’s R2 launch is slated for Q2 2026 with a target gross margin of 25 % (source 4LQD15CFU), Tesla’s Q2 gross margin fell to 17.9 % (source JVKCZAPVG).  Include projected cash‑flow metrics (Rivian’s $6.6 bn DOE loan, Tesla’s $146 m free cash flow) and dividend sustainability (Donegal’s yield decline from 3.5 % in 2020 to 2.1 % in 2024, source TN66GHPAT).\n\n3. **Build a coherent causal chain** – for each sector, map the *invariant* to the *market outcome*:  \n   - *Tech*: AI‑driven productivity → higher cloud margins → higher valuation multiples → sustained dividend payouts.  \n   - *EV*: Tariff exposure + loss of $7,500 credit → cost‑structure pressure → R2’s lower price point → volume‑driven margin recovery → EBITDA breakeven by 2027.  \n   - *Insurance*: Capital‑intensity + solvency rules → margin compression → dividend payout ratio tightening → investor perception shift.  \n   - *Labor*: Layoff reflex → morale loss → productivity decline → higher cost of capital → lower earnings quality.  \n\n4. **Use source IDs consistently** – every numeric or qualitative claim must be followed by a citation in the form `[ID]`.  For example: “Microsoft’s Azure revenue grew 39 % YoY to $30 bn【0G3A676BP】.”  Ensure all critical sources (0G3A676BP, 4LQD15CFU, JVKCZAPVG, TN66GHPAT, 4LQD15CFU) are referenced; avoid generic statements that cannot be traced.\n\n5. **Clarify the multi‑year horizon** – explicitly state the *transition conditions* for each regime: e.g., “Microsoft will remain a ‘forever’ stock as long as AI‑enabled cloud margins stay above 30 % and the Fed keeps real rates below 2 %.”  Provide a *scenario structure*: baseline, upside (R2 launch ahead of schedule), downside (Tesla’s robotaxi fails).  Quantify the impact on the S&P 500: e.g., “If Rivian hits EBITDA breakeven in 2027, the S&P 500 could rise 12 % over the next 5 years.”\n\n6. **Highlight key risks and watchpoints** – list them as bullet points with concrete triggers:  \n   - Fed rate hikes > 0.25 % → cloud demand slowdown.  \n   - Tesla’s robotaxi pilot fails to achieve >10 % market share → valuation compression.  \n   - U.S. tax credit policy changes → EV demand shock.  \n   - Insurance capital rule tightening → Donegal dividend cut.  \n\n7. **Conclude with a confidence rating** – explain the basis: “Moderate‑high confidence because the causal links are grounded in structural fundamentals, but volatility in EV and insurance sectors introduces uncertainty.”\n\n**Actionable edit instructions**\n\n- Replace the first paragraph with a concise statement of the five structural anchors and their relevance to the four companies.  \n- Insert numeric ranges and source IDs after every statistic.  \n- Re‑organize the analysis into four sections (Tech, EV, Insurance, Labor) each with a clear causal chain diagram (textual).  \n- Add a “Scenario Table” summarizing baseline, upside, downside, and key metrics.  \n- End with a bullet‑point risk list and a confidence rating.  \n- Ensure every claim is traceable to a source ID; remove any un‑cited generic statements.",
