  "description": "Woolworths shoppers are threatening to 'boycott' the supermarket chain after spotting an unexpected item at the deli counter.",
  "content": "Woolworths shoppers are threatening to 'boycott' the supermarket chain after discovering deli meat offcuts were being sold.\n\nA customer shared a controversial picture of the 'Meat Pieces Mixed', which cost NZ$15 per kilo (A$13.70) at an Auckland store.\n\nThe tray shows an assortment of cold deli meat scraps and 'end pieces' that are 'made in New Zealand' - including frankfurts, salami, chunks of ham, roast beef and more.\n\n'Recession indicator?' the customer said in a Reddit thread, alongside the picture.\n\nThe post was met with hundreds of comments after the picture began circulating on social media, with many saying they were 'appalled' to see the 'nasty' tray of offcuts.\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, a Woolworths New Zealand spokeswoman told Daily Mail they have since pulled the meat pieces from sale amid backlash.\n\n'A tray of mixed meat pieces sold at Woolworths Metro in Auckland has now been removed from our delicatessen,' the Woolworths NZ spokesperson said.\n\n'We do sometimes sell the ends of our sliced meat range in an effort to reduce food waste and divert food products from landfill. However, in this instance we did not get it right. We apologise for any confusion caused.'\n\nThe apology comes after shoppers were 'disgusted' when a picture emerged showing the deli meat offcuts in question.\n\n'As a butcher at a small independent store, this is absolutely disgusting and just taking the p***. Although this is still protein, albeit s***, unfortunately, with the cost of proper meat, people will still buy this. But the price is criminal. Go support your local butcher,' one ranted.\n\n'Can't believe this is real,' another said in disbelief.\n\n'The audacity to sell waste is honestly wild,' another added.\n\nThere was some confusion around the purpose of the meat mixes, with many pointing out they are typically sold as 'pet food' at their local butchers.\n\nMeanwhile, many deli workers came forward to confirm their butcher stores sold similar offcuts to customers.\n\n'It was always the leftover pieces from things that weren't sold every second day and the end pieces of ham that were sliced,' one revealed.\n\n'I work in a deli in South Australia and we do it too. It's just end pieces of whatever to save on waste. Although that sausage in there is a crime,' another shared.\n\n'It's mainly just the offcuts from the slicer that you can't normally sell because they don't \"look good\". Not really any different than the ugly odd-bunch vegetables you can get for cheaper. It'd just go in the bin otherwise,' one revealed.\n\nMany Aussies revealed they 'grew up' eating deli meat scraps as a 'snack'.\n\n'Yep totally normal here in Tasmania, we all eat this almost every day. It's basically a traditional lunch/brunch. It's what we all got brought up on in school. Love it. We call it meaty mix,' one shared.\n\n'I remember getting this sort of mix as a kid in Queensland. It was called \"end mix\" and was exactly that... I think I'm for it,' another revealed.\n\nMany were not 'offended' by the tray, with one suggesting: 'What's wrong with it? Looks delicious, way more convenient than buying each cut of meat individually.\n\n'Meat ends are the best. Omg,' one said.\n\n'I get it all the time from Woolworths, I'm in New Zealand, great for snacking on. Why waste the meat?' another revealed.\n\n'This was a poor household dream. Lived on this as a kid growing up in South Auckland,' one shared.\n\n'This is actually genius. Cheap and you get a whole mix of stuff for sandwiches and all sorts. Problem is how do they keep track of dates for the different meats? Unless it's done one day and written down and kept track of,' another explained.\n\n'They definitely do this in NZ... My little sister absolutely loves it, it's like a meat party mix to her. Once they had the meat scraps cubed up like dice and she nearly cried,' one added.",
