  "title": "Can You Claim Social Security After Age 70?",
  "description": "Many people rush to claim Social Security early. But what about those who want to keep waiting?",
  "content": "\u2022 Age 62 is a common age to file for Social Security.\n\u2022 There are financial benefits to delay your claim beyond that point.\n\u2022 You don't want to wait on Social Security too long, since it could cause you to lose out on money you're entitled to.\n\nAs you approach retirement, you may end up facing some tough choices. Where should you live? Should you stay in your home or downsize for the savings? And when should you start taking withdrawals from your IRA or 401(k) plan?\n\nAnother hard decision you'll need to make in the context of retirement is when to claim Social Security. The earliest age you can sign up to get benefits is 62. And that happens to be a popular age to file.\n\nMany seniors like the idea of getting their money as soon as possible. But if you don't wait until full retirement age to claim Social Security, your monthly benefits will be reduced on a permanent basis. Full retirement age is 67 for anyone born in 1960 or later.\n\nThere's also the option to sign up for Social Security after reaching full retirement age. And you'll be rewarded if you do.\n\nFor each year you delay your claim past full retirement age, your benefits get an 8% boost. And that boost is a permanent one.\n\nIf you're going to delay your claim, though, it doesn't pay to wait on Social Security past age 70. Even though you're allowed to file for benefits after turning 70, waiting that long could cost you.\n\nWhy 70 is generally considered the latest age to claim Social Security\n\nYou'll often hear that 70 is the latest age to sign up for Social Security. That's technically not true.\n\nYou can sign up for Social Security whenever you want once you reach age 62. Want to file for benefits at 80? Nobody is going to stop you.\n\nHowever, the delayed retirement credits you accumulate for delaying your Social Security claim past full retirement age stop accruing at age 70, so there's absolutely no financial upside to waiting beyond that point.\n\nIf you claim Social Security after turning 70, Social Security may not pay you all of the benefits you could've had sooner. While the program will pay up to six months of retroactive benefits, that only helps if you put in your claim by 70 1/2.\n\nIf you file for Social Security at 71, you're basically saying \"no thanks\" to six months' worth of benefits for no good reason. And the more you delay beyond that point, the more money you risk losing out on.\n\nBe careful even when claiming Social Security at 70\n\nWhile filing for Social Security after age 70 doesn't make financial sense, filing at 70 is a different story. But even that strategy can backfire on you.",

      "text": "Social Security forms an important part of most people's retirement plans, but the program itself does much more than just that. In a nutshell, Social Security is designed to support disabled and retired workers and their families by providing a guaranteed source of lifetime income for those who meet certain criteria.\nHere's a closer look at how the program works, the different types of Social Security benefits available, and what you can expect when you're ready to claim benefits.\nHow Social Security works\nHow Social Security works\nSocial Security is a government program that collects taxes from working Americans and distributes these funds to qualifying disabled workers, retirees, and their families to help them remain financially secure.\nA worker typically must earn 40 credits to qualify for Social Security, though if they die or are disabled young, they may qualify with fewer credits. A credit is defined as $1,730 of earned income in 2024 and $1,810 of earned income in 2025. You can earn up to four credits per year.\nYou may claim Social Security based on your own work record, if you've earned enough credits, or you may be eligible to claim spousal benefits based on your current or ex-spouse's work record if this amount is larger than what you're entitled to on your own. Dependent children and other family members may also qualify for family benefits in certain circumstances.\nWhen you're ready to apply for Social Security, you must fill out an application online or at your local Social Security Administration office. A government representative will verify the information in your application to determine if you qualify and then you'll begin receiving monthly checks.\nTypes of Social Security benefits\nTypes of Social Security benefits\nThere are three main types of Social Security benefits:\n- Retirement benefits\n- Disability benefits\n- Survivors benefits\nRetirement benefits\nRetirement benefits\nSocial Security retirement benefits are for workers 62 and older who have earned at least 40 credits. The size of your benefit checks depends on your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) over your 35 highest-earning years, and the age at which you begin benefits.\nYou must wait until your full retirement age (FRA) to claim your standard benefit based on your AIME. Your FRA is 66 if you were born between 1943 and 1954. For those born between 1955 and 1959, FRA rose by two months every year thereafter. For anyone born in 1960 or later, full retirement age is 67.\nClaiming benefits before your full retirement age (FRA) reduces your checks.\nIf you begin claiming at 62, you'll get only 70% of your standard benefit if your FRA is 67 or 75% if your FRA is 66. Every month you delay benefits increases your checks slightly until you reach the maximum benefit at 70. This is 124% of your standard benefit if your FRA is 67 or 132% if your FRA is 66.\nReceiving Social Security benefits under your FRA could cause you to lose some of that money back to the government if your income is high enough. The Social Security Earnings Test withholds:\n- $1 from your checks for every $2 you earn above $22,320 per year if you will be under your full retirement age all year in 2024.\n- $1 from your checks for every $2 you earn above $23,400 per year if you will be under your full retirement age all year in 2025.\n- $1 for every $3 you earn over $59,520 if you will reach full retirement age in 2024.\n- $1 for every $3 you earn over $62,160 if you will reach your full retirement age in 2025.\nOnce you're past your FRA, the government recalculates your benefit to include the amount it withheld.\nCertain family members can claim benefits on your work record if doing so would give them more money than they're eligible for on their own work record.\nEligible family members include:\nEligible family members include:\n- Spouses\n- Ex-spouses, if the marriage lasted for at least 10 years and they have not remarried\n- Children under 18, or up to 19 if still enrolled in high school\n- Children of any age who were disabled before 22 and are not earning more than $1,550 per month in 2024 or $1,620 per month in 2025. Social Security defines disability as a medical condition that results in severe functional limitations and that is expected to last 12 months or longer or result in death\nSpouses and ex-spouses must be at least 62 in order to claim benefits, and spouses and children must wait for the worker to begin claiming benefits themselves before they can claim family benefits on their record.\nDisability benefits\nDisability benefits\nSocial Security disability benefits are available to adults 18 or older who are unable to work due to a physical or mental disability that is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death. You may still be eligible even if you haven't earned 40 credits, depending upon your age at the time of your disability. Your benefit is determined by your average lifetime earnings, so individuals who earned more while they were working will receive larger disability checks.\nYou must provide the government with information about your work history and your medical condition, including relevant supporting documents, when you apply. The Social Security Administration will review your case to decide if you are eligible. If it rules in your favor, you'll receive disability checks for as long as your disability lasts or the rest of your life, depending on the condition. If it rules against you, you may request a reconsideration or appeal to an administrative law judge.\nFamily members may be able to claim benefits on a disabled worker\u2019s work record if they are:\n- A spouse 62 or older or of any age if caring for a disabled worker\u2019s disabled child or child 16 or younger\n- Ex-spouses who were married to the disabled worker for at least 10 years and have not remarried if they meet the same criteria as spouses\n- Unmarried children up to 18, or 19 if still attending high school\n- Children of any age who were disabled before 22\nSurvivors benefits\nSurvivors benefits\nSurvivors benefits are benefits for the family members of deceased workers who qualified for Social Security.\nThe amount of the survivors benefit depends on the deceased worker's average income, adjusted for inflation, and their relationship to the deceased.\nSurviving spouses who are 60 or older (50 or older if disabled) may claim survivors benefits, as can surviving spouses of any age if they are caring for the deceased worker's child who is under 16 or disabled. The same rules apply for ex-spouses as long as they were married to the deceased worker for at least 10 years and have not remarried.\nThe deceased worker's children under 18, or up to 19 if still enrolled in high school, are eligible for benefits, as are disabled children of any age if they were disabled before 22. Parents of the deceased worker may also qualify for benefits if the deceased was providing 50% or more of their financial support before they died.\nIn addition to these benefits, the surviving spouse or children may be eligible for a one-time death benefit of $255.\nRelated Retirement Topics\nBrief history of Social Security\nBrief history of Social Security\nThe Social Security program was created by the Social Security Act that President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law in 1935. The first checks went out in 1940. Originally it paid benefits only to workers 65 and older, but in the 1970s the government altered it to allow workers to claim benefits as early as 62. It also instituted annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to help Social Security keep pace with inflation.\nThe program has worked fairly well so far, but many people fear for the future, when there will be fewer workers to support a greater number of Social Security recipients.\nThe latest Social Security Trustees' Report indicates that the program's retirement trust fund could be depleted by 2033, after which it would be able to pay out only about 79% of benefits to retirees. Though previous reports estimated that Social Security's disability trust fund would run dry by 2057, the latest trustee's report projects that the disability trust fund will not be depleted in the next 75 years.\nThe government has proposed several possible solutions for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the program, but at present no plans have been set. There's no risk of the program disappearing in the next decade or two, but it's possible future benefits may not go as far as they do today. That's why today's workers need to prioritize their personal retirement savings, so they can cover most of their expenses on their own."

      "text": "Full retirement age (FRA) is the age when you can claim your standard Social Security retirement benefit. Your standard benefit is called your primary insurance amount (PIA), and it's based on your inflation-adjusted average wages earned throughout your career.\nFull retirement age varies by birth year. For those born in 1960 or later, FRA is 67. If you were born between 1943 and 1959, FRA is 66 and a number of months (dependent on your year of birth). For instance, if you were born in 1959, it is 66 and 10 months.\nIt is important to know your full retirement age, as it affects when you can claim Social Security without reducing your benefits. It also impacts the amount of delayed retirement credits you can earn to raise your benefits and how much you can earn from working while receiving Social Security without forfeiting any of your benefits.\nFRA chart\nSocial Security full retirement age chart\nThe chart below shows the full retirement age for people born at different times.\n| Birth Year | Full Retirement Age |\n|---|---|\n| 1943 to 1954 | 66 |\n| 1955 | 66 and 2 months |\n| 1956 | 66 and 4 months |\n| 1957 | 66 and 6 months |\n| 1958 | 66 and 8 months |\n| 1959 | 66 and 10 months |\n| 1960 and later | 67 |\nThe effect of age\nHow does full retirement age affect your Social Security benefits?\nIf you claim your benefits at full retirement age, you will receive your standard Social Security benefit amount. If you claim prior to FRA, you will be subject to early filing penalties that reduce your benefit by the following amounts:\n- Five-ninths of 1% for each of the first 36 months before FRA\n- Five-twelfths of 1% for each subsequent month before FRA\nThis amounts to a 6.66% annual reduction for each of the first three years and an additional 5% reduction for each following year before FRA. For example, if you claim benefits at 62 with an FRA of 67, you will face a full 30% reduction in benefits.\nBy contrast, if you claim benefits after FRA, you receive delayed retirement credits valued at two-thirds of 1% per month. This results in an 8% annual increase to your monthly benefit. You can earn delayed retirement credits until age 70. After that, there's no financial benefit in delaying your claim. Delayed retirement credits cannot be earned if you are claiming either spousal benefits or survivor benefits.\nWorking past FRA\nWorking after full retirement age\nRetirees may work while collecting Social Security benefits, but those younger than their FRA will be subject to the retirement earnings test (RET). Under this test, if your earnings exceed a certain limit (which changes annually), you will temporarily forfeit some or all of your benefits. Once you reach full retirement age, your benefit is recalculated, and you may receive most of that money back.\nOther questions\nOther key questions about full retirement age\nThere are a few additional key points to consider regarding full retirement age.\n1. Do survivor benefits increase after full retirement age?\nIf you are the surviving spouse who is claiming benefits based on your deceased partner's work record, there is no benefit to waiting until after full retirement age to claim your benefits. You do not earn delayed retirement credits in this case, so your benefit will not increase.\nHowever, if you are the higher-earning spouse, delaying your claim for benefits until after FRA can result in your widow(er) receiving more monthly income, as your widowed partner will receive the higher of the two monthly benefits you were each receiving.\n2. Are Social Security benefits taxable at full retirement age?\nYour age does not have an impact on whether you will owe federal tax on Social Security benefits. Depending on your earnings, you may pay federal taxes on Social Security benefits regardless of the age at which you claim.\nSocial Security benefits are taxed on amounts exceeding the \"provisional income\" limit set by the IRS. To calculate your provisional income, add up all non-Social Security sources of income, including nontaxable income such as municipal bond interest, and include half of your annual Social Security income.\nSingle filers earning provisional income between $25,000 and $34,000 and married joint filers earning between $32,000 and $44,000 will owe income taxes on 50% of their Social Security benefits. For single filers with provisional income above $34,000 and married filers above $44,000, up to 85% of Social Security benefits will be taxable.\nTaxes on Social Security remain in effect following the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill\" (now law) on July 4, 2025. However, a new temporary tax deduction has reduced the number of retirees taxed on benefits because the deductions for more retired people now exceed their taxable benefits.\nThe White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that 88% of retirees will not pay tax on their payments as long as the deduction remains in effect.\nRelated retirement topics\n3. Is your full retirement age affected by where you live?\nYour full retirement age is not affected by where you live. Most Social Security rules, including those that determine benefit amount and claiming age, are set by federal law. However, some states do tax Social Security benefits, so where you live can affect tax levels on your retirement income. But again, the age at which you claim benefits won't affect your tax rate -- your income is the key factor.\nFAQ\nFull retirement age FAQ\nWhat is the full retirement age?\nFull retirement age (FRA) is based on when you were born. If you were born in 1960 or later, FRA is 67. If you were born between 1943 and 1959, FRA is 66 and a number of months (dependent on your year of birth). For instance, if you were born in 1959, it is 66 and 10 months.\nIs the full retirement age changing in 2025?\nFull retirement age changed in 2025. If you turn 66 in 2025, your FRA is 66 and 10 months. If you turned 66 in 2024, FRA was 66 and 8 months. Retirees turning 66 this year must claim benefits two months later than last year to avoid early filing penalties.\nIs it better to claim Social Security at 62 or 67?\nFor anyone born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age for Social Security is 67. That means you will receive your standard unreduced benefit if you wait to claim, and monthly checks will be larger.\nHowever, some people prefer to claim at a younger age to enable early retirement or for other reasons, such as poor health. Both options can make sense, as it depends on your circumstances and goals.\nCan I work after full retirement age?\nYou can work after full retirement age and earn as much as you'd like without affecting your Social Security benefits.\nHow much can I earn if I work after my full retirement age?\nIf you continue to work after reaching full retirement age, you may work and earn as much as you'd like. You will not be subject to the retirement earnings test, and your Social Security benefits will not be affected.\nIf you claim benefits and continue working prior to FRA, you may forfeit part of your benefits if you earn above annual thresholds. However, your benefit amount will be recalculated at full retirement age to account for most of those forfeited funds.\nDoes working after full retirement age increase Social Security benefits?\nWorking after full retirement age could increase your Social Security benefits. Your benefits are based on average wages over your 35 highest-earning years (adjusted for inflation).\nEven after you've reached full retirement age, and even if you've already claimed benefits, the Social Security Administration continues to recalculate your average annual wage to account for new income. If your earnings after FRA are higher than previous years and raise your average wage for your 35 top-earning years, your benefits could rise accordingly."

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the optimal age for claiming Social Security benefits, highlighting that while age 62 is common, delaying benefits until full retirement age (67 for those born in 1960 or later) can significantly increase monthly payments. Delaying beyond age 70 offers no additional financial benefits, as delayed retirement credits cease to accrue. It also outlines the types of Social Security benefits available, including retirement, disability, and survivors benefits, and emphasizes the importance of understanding full retirement age and its impact on benefit amounts.",
