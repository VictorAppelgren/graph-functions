  "title": "How do you assess Jack Grealish\u2019s four season-spell at Manchester City?",
  "description": "Grealish won several major honours with City but only in 2022-23 did he take games by the scruff of the neck like he had at Villa",
  "content": "\u201cThere\u2019s times where I think what might have happened if I had stayed at Villa\u2026 it would have been nice to stay there for my whole career,\u201d says Jack Grealish in Waking the Giant, a book documenting Aston Villa\u2019s resurgence, co-written by The Athletic\u2019s Gregg Evans.\n\nWhat could have been is a concept Grealish has increasingly been able to contemplate at Manchester City.\n\nGrealish made only 17 Premier League starts over the last two seasons, with Jeremy Doku, Omar Marmoush, Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki, Savinho and Oscar Bobb all ahead of him.\n\nHis season-long loan to Everton ends the impasse, but Grealish has not always been cast in the wrong movie.\n\nThe \u00a3100million ($135m at current rates) fee paid to Aston Villa in 2021 made him a British record signing at the time and, in his second season, he was a starter who Pep Guardiola wholly trusted as City became only the second English team to win the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup in the same year. An increasingly-integral Grealish started 41 games in that gilded campaign and provided 11 assists, both career-high figures in a single season, per Fbref.\n\nHowever, he was underwhelming in the three seasons either side of that treble, and, even in the periods Grealish proved valuable, it was his tactical diligence and conformity to the overarching script that was to be appreciated rather than the big-screen moments expected of a player who cost so much.\n\nGrealish\u2019s performances were art house when he was expected to be blockbuster.\n\nThe apparent change to his game, the sacrifice and compromise of the individual in favour of the collective, has delivered five major trophies and taken him to the very top of the sport.\n\nThe trophies he won have vindicated his move but did the transfer to City fulfill him?\n\nDid it do his own game justice to become a cog in a more powerful machine than to be the brain, heart and engine of one he helped rebuild?\n\nBefore moving to Bayern Munich in 2023, aged 30, Harry Kane had spent his entire career at Tottenham Hotspur racking up individual accolades while being lamented for not being part of a team that won titles. The four years Grealish has spent at City represent the reverse.\n\nThe nine-figure price tag dictates that his time at the Etihad Stadium will be seen as a relative failure, but his exit leaves a strange CV to assess. He made 157 appearances, scored 17 goals, provided 23 assists, and regularly contributed to one of the most dominant teams in English football history \u2014 yet City could still consider themselves somewhat fortunate to ship him out on loan with an option-to-buy worth half of what he initially cost.\n\nThe loss of his sparkle returns us to the opening consideration of what could have happened had he resisted the ambition to play for the best team and manager in the world and stayed at his boyhood club.\n\nHow would he have developed had he remained the big fish in a small pond rather than the small fish in the big pond he became at City?\n\nThe vision of Grealish in claret and blue, dancing his way through impossible gaps and playing with the street footballer swagger, conjures far more colourful memories than the more considered, deliberate version witnessed at City.\n\nHe has not recaptured the feeling he transmitted of a young man overflowing with imagination and confidence.\n\nIn his final season at Villa, 2020-21, there was a reasonable argument that he was the best individual player in the league as he slalomed past crowds of players.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the best football I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d he says in Waking the Giant.\n\n\u201cI was the fittest, strongest and fastest I have ever been, and obviously the most confident.\u201d\n\nThe influence of Guardiola\u2019s positional football is a factor. Grealish\u2019s role was restricted in its scope given he was rigidly positioned on the left flank, but to suggest that Guardiola outlawed Grealish from dribbling is a fanciful explanation for his lack of flow.\n\nLeroy Sane, Raheem Sterling, Riyad Mahrez and Doku were all dribblers before working with Guardiola and remained so under Guardiola. Yes, he helped make some more efficient and helped pick their moments more precisely, but they are on record stating that the manager\u2019s entire philosophy is based on working the ball to the wingers in one-v-one situations so that they can take on their opponent.\n\nThe more fundamental issue is more human. Grealish had grown up at his boyhood club and established himself as the best player in the team at an early age, which is why Villa team-mate John McGinn joked that his job was to simply \u201cgive the ball to Jack\u201d.\n\nOnce he moved to City, that deference was gone. Grealish remained a very good player whose ability to retain possession and combine in tight areas is up there with the best, but it often felt like he internalised his role as being about working the ball to Kevin De Bruyne, Erling Haaland or Foden rather than being the one to produce magic.\n\nHe may have been considered as De Bruyne\u2019s heir when he joined in 2021 but his status has slipped, even if, in December, it seemed like his manager may have had a belated epiphany as he started playing him in central midfield.\n\n\u201cHe has the attributes to play there,\u201d said Guardiola.\n\n\u201cMaybe it was my mistake to play him as a winger. But in Aston Villa with Dean (Smith) he started from, I would say, the left position, the winger position, and after going more inside. Here it\u2019s a more fixed position, more in the places.\u201d\n\nWhen assessing the motivations behind the option to stay at Villa in 2021, second behind loyalty is the England national team and whether his roaming style of play would have helped him become the talismanic creator many feel was missing under Gareth Southgate.\n\nGrealish accepted that he had to move this summer to play regularly. Next year\u2019s World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada could represent his last chance to leave an imprint on the national team.\n\nHaving made his England debut in August 2020, aged 24, Grealish has gone from a total of 12 caps and seven starts when he joined City in August 2021 to 39 caps and 18 starts.\n\nThe hair band, the trademark low socks, the mesmerising dribbling ability, the caring brotherly nature, the off-the-pitch antics \u2014 Jack the lad, literally.\n\nGrealish had everything to become English football\u2019s poster boy. In some ways, he did. After his move to City in 2021, he was the face of the club and was a staple of their kit launches. A Gucci brand ambassador deal followed, as did contracts with Puma, Pepsi, Bose, Airwayz, Electronic Arts and Hellmann\u2019s.\n\nThose are deals that players only get if they are playing at the very top level. If anything summed up the dichotomy between Grealish\u2019s potential as the public\u2019s golden boy and the flatlining four years at City, however, it is the last commercial endorsement in that list.\n\nHe spent the summer of 2024 plastered across the nations\u2019s televisions as the face of the mayonnaise brand\u2019s \u2018Up Your Game\u2019 barbecue campaign for Euro 2024, but was left out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s 26-man squad.\n\nGrealish said it was the hardest moment of his career and vowed to use it as motivation but last season was essentially a write-off as Guardiola began leaving him out of squads completely.\n\nGrealish has realised his trophy ambitions during his time at City but he turns 30 next month. He will banking on rediscovering his spark and earn a place in Thomas Tuchel\u2019s England squad next summer.\n\nEverton are a club starting a fresh chapter at their state-of-the-art stadium, searching for a new king after years of simply surviving. On paper, it looks as good a fit as Grealish could have hoped for.\n\nThere is a perception that has developed over the years that David Moyes is a manager who is inherently defensive and predisposed to athleticism over flair \u2014 but tell that to Steven Pienaar, Mikel Arteta, Leon Osman and Jarrod Bowen, just some of the smaller, technical-based players he helped thrive at Everton and West Ham United. Iliman Ndiaye is not exactly looking inhibited on Everton\u2019s left wing.\n\nThey should provide Grealish with the platform to be the main man again and the freedom to take games by the scruff of the neck in a way that has been absent for far too long.\n\nIs it possible to rediscover that identity and to play with the same youthful after years of playing and thinking in a much less spontaneous way? It is difficult to imagine that gift being recycled once the genie has been put back in the bottle but, three days after Grealish reaches his milestone birthday, he will face his former club Villa.\n\nIt is a fixture that will cause him to once again ponder the varying roads that his career could have taken.",

      "text": "Everton have agreed a deal to take Jack Grealish on loan from Manchester City.\nThe deal still needs to be finalised but a medical is being scheduled today for the England international. An option to buy in the region of \u00a350million ($67.3m) will be included.\nThe Athletic reported on August 6 that Everton had opened talks with City over a move for the 29-year-old, whose contract at the Etihad Stadium expires in 2027.\nAdvertisement\nGrealish made only 16 starts in all competitions last season and just seven in the Premier League. He was left out of the City squad for their final game of the Premier League season against Fulham \u2014 which manager Pep Guardiola described as \u201cnothing personal\u201d \u2014 and was not included in the squad that travelled to the United States for this summer\u2019s Club World Cup. Phil Foden, Savinho, Jeremy Doku, Kevin De Bruyne, Omar Marmoush and Bernardo Silva have often been preferred to Grealish in City\u2019s front line.\nAfter coming through the academy at Aston Villa and becoming club captain in 2019, Grealish joined City for a club record fee of \u00a3100million, also a record amount for a British player. He signed a six-year deal and has made 157 appearances for the club, scoring 17 goals and providing 23 assists.\nGrealish has won the Premier League three times with City, as well as the Champions League, FA Cup and the Club World Cup. He was an integral part of the team in the 2022-23 campaign, making 50 appearances as City won the treble, starting every knockout game in the Champions League.\nGuardiola had previously expressed a desire to see Grealish return to the level that she showed during that campaign. \u201cDo I want the Jack that won the treble? Yeah, I want it, but I try to be honest with myself,\u201d the Spaniard said in January.\n\u201cI fought a lot for him, fought a lot to be here. I know that he can do it because I saw him. I saw his level and I want that, every single training session and every single game.\u201d\nA deal for Grealish would see him become Everton\u2019s fifth new arrival of the summer, with Thierno Barry, Mark Travers, Adam Aznou and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall moving from Villareal, Bournemouth, Bayern Munich and Chelsea respectively. Carlos Alcaraz also joined the club permanently after his loan spell at Goodison Park last season.\n\u2018Grealish could be a talisman \u2013 but not a signing without risk\u2019\nAnalysis by Everton correspondent Patrick Boyland\nGrealish would be a marquee signing, and one that would excite most Everton fans. The Merseyside team had the fourth-best defensive record in the Premier League last season, but have long lacked a game-changer in attack.\nAt his best, Grealish could be that player; a catalyst to drive the side on, and a talisman as Everton head into a new era in their 52,769-capacity Hill Dickinson Stadium.\nAdvertisement\nGrealish is expected to be the main man in David Moyes\u2019 side, dictating play both from the centre and the left. In that sense, it will be intriguing to see how it all knits together.\nIliman Ndiaye, Everton\u2019s most productive attacker last season, works in similar areas, while new \u00a325million signing Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall lined up in the No 10 role at the weekend against Roma. Everton also still need to address the lack of pace and goal threat on the right flank.\nWith Everton expected to pay a sizeable chunk of Grealish\u2019s \u00a3300,000-a-week wages, this is a costly signing not without an element of risk. One that may well define the early part of The Friedkin Group\u2019s (TFG) tenure.\nThe total package, comfortably in excess of \u00a310m, could end up looking like a bargain if the former Villa man returns to the levels of old and catapults the side up the table.\nBut there are, of course, no guarantees. Grealish spent last season on the periphery at City and needs minutes if he is to have a chance of reviving his fortunes and making the World Cup with England next summer.\nWhatever happens from here, American owner TFG has shown it will put its hand in the pocket and that the years of austerity at Everton are over. It will be fascinating to see how it all works out.\n(Top photo: Carl Recine/Getty Images)"

      "text": "A gamble worth taking. That was the view of senior figures connected to Everton and owner The Friedkin Group (TFG) as the club weighed up an ambitious move to sign Jack Grealish from Manchester City.\nAs far as they were concerned, the risk attached did not outweigh the potential reward. Instead, the general feeling was that the move had the potential to be a game-changer, ushering in an ambitious new era for Everton.\nAdvertisement\nThey had long been aware Grealish could be available in this window, and kept tabs on his situation throughout the summer. They also knew he would not come cheap, with City initially favouring either a permanent transfer or a loan with all of his wages covered.\nEverton could not go quite that far, even with the billionaire backing of TFG. Internal estimates suggested they could stretch to an overall package of around \u00a312million ($16.2m) for the season, which would make Grealish comfortably the highest-paid player at the club.\nAt certain points, there was a suspicion the 29-year-old would be pushed elsewhere, towards a more lucrative deal, or that a club offering Champions League football in a campaign leading up to the World Cup would lean on him to plug a gap that had emerged during their pre-season.\nGrealish, though, let it be known that he wanted Everton. Those regular checks, made throughout the off-season, paid dividends, as did the intervention of the manager David Moyes, who made a compelling case during talks.\nDiscussions, formal and otherwise, took place over a couple of months, then, as reported by The Athletic, accelerated last week between the clubs. Negotiations on the Everton side were handled by head of trading Nick Hammond and new chief executive Angus Kinnear.\nAt that stage, Grealish had already made up his mind.\nThe attacking midfielder had expected to be plying his trade away from City in the coming season since the end of the last one but, much like Everton, pushed for the move to happen now rather than right at the end of the window in late August, after the campaign had begun. His desire to join Everton helped to smooth out the process during talks. For him, hitting the ground running in a World Cup season is key, given his lingering international aspirations.\nThe momentum was such that much of the excitable chatter at Everton\u2019s new Hill Dickinson Stadium on Saturday, as the first team played their final pre-season friendly against Italian visitors Roma, was about the prospect of Grealish being in situ before the opening fixture away at promoted Leeds United on Monday, August 18.\nAdvertisement\nAn outline agreement was subsequently reached between the two clubs on Monday. Though at that stage, some finer details were still being thrashed out. This was a complex deal, including discussions on how image rights and bonuses from his City contract could be translated into the new agreement. Yet there was enough confidence on both sides for the medical to happen at Everton\u2019s usual facility in Newton-le-Willows, a small market town midway between Liverpool and Manchester. There, in his velour tracksuit, Grealish posed for photos with excited Everton fans ahead of the move being confirmed.\nHe joined officially on Tuesday, before heading to the stadium to go through his media duties with club channels. Grealish, who turns 30 on September 10, arrived at the new \u00a3800m facility on Liverpool\u2019s waterfront to find his name up on the big screen and on the LED advertising boards around the pitch. It is early days, but the club are doing their best to make him feel at home.\nEverton see this as a statement signing \u2014 their first of those since Colombia captain James Rodriguez\u2019s free-transfer arrival from Real Madrid in September 2020 and a potentially symbolic moment for the new ownership. After years of penny-pinching and doom-laden financial predictions, the club\u2019s era of austerity looks very much over.\nEverton will cover around three-quarters of Grealish\u2019s \u00a3300,000 a week salary, with City including a \u00a350m purchase option in the deal, but a fee could still be negotiated if Everton want to make it permanent next summer.\nThat final bit is a conversation for another day, though. For now, the belief is that Everton have landed much-needed star quality for the first season of their new stadium \u2014 and a potential coup if Grealish can get anywhere close to recapturing the form of old.\nGrealish was not short of admirers, even if his situation at City created a considerable barrier to entry for interested parties. He had been disappointed with his lack of minutes last season and knew it was time to move on after four years at the Etihad, while the club had also planned for life without him.\nAdvertisement\nFellow Premier League side West Ham monitored the situation, while a potential move to Italian side Napoli was discussed. Celtic expressed interest, but Grealish never seriously considered a move to Scotland.\nTurkey\u2019s Fenerbahce were among the most significant contenders, and could have got close to meeting City\u2019s financial demands. There was a sense from others involved in the deal that Grealish was being pushed in that direction, but the midfielder was not keen on moving to Istanbul. He had sought advice from friends regarding a potential transfer to Turkish football and was keen to remain in the Premier League.\nA decisive intervention from Moyes swung the matter in Everton\u2019s favour. During lengthy talks between the Scot, Grealish and the player\u2019s camp, it was emphasised that he would be a key pillar in Moyes\u2019 setup this season. Discussions also centred on where he would fit into the side, with Grealish likely to drift between the No 10 role and left flank. It was felt that Moyes was likely to be a positive influence on the player at a pivotal moment in his career.\nWhile Everton started the summer by bringing in youngsters such as 22-year-old Thierno Barry and Adam Aznou, 19, Moyes wanted to add more Premier League experience as well as a marquee signing to excite the supporters. He was backed in that pursuit by the owners and CEO Kinnear.\nAll of that was important to Grealish in what is a World Cup year. He is desperate to get back in the England fold, having not made a squad since winning the most recent of his 34 senior international caps against Finland last October, and has held positive talks with national-team manager Thomas Tuchel. He knows he needs to play regularly at club level to be considered, with the prospect of participation in the tournament in North America next summer a key motivation.\nEverton sold their project to him. Alongside the sense that he would be the main man in their attack, they are showing ambition with their new stadium and other work in the transfer market. Moyes is targeting another three or four new additions before the end of the window, with new wingers, a central midfielder and a right-back on his list.\nThere was a sense that Grealish needed to be somewhere he felt valued. During a summer trip to the Spanish resort of Marbella, he bumped into former Everton captain Alan Stubbs, who emphasised how much he would be loved by the club\u2019s fanbase.\nPositive references about the place came from players who have featured more recently for Everton, with goalkeeper Jordan Pickford a friend from England duty and represented by the same CAA Stellar agency. Everton\u2019s relationship with Stellar is positive following discussions with one of their other clients, striker Liam Delap, before his move from Ipswich Town to Chelsea earlier this summer. Also, in signing for Everton, Grealish will avoid having to relocate from his Cheshire home.\nAdvertisement\nHe will wear the No 18 shirt at his new club. The No 8 was also vacant, but the Birmingham-born midfielder decided to follow in the footsteps of two personal heroes, Paul Gascoigne and Wayne Rooney, who both wore 18 at Everton. \u201cI spoke to Wayne before I came here and I mentioned that to him \u2013 about the number 18 \u2013 so I hope he\u2019s happy as well,\u201d Grealish said.\nThere is no guarantee this move will work out, but all parties felt confident enough to give it a go. Creating the right conditions for Grealish to succeed at Everton will be key if he is to return to the form that led to a British record \u00a3100million move from Aston Villa to City in the summer of 2021.\nWith no major national-team competition this summer and having been left out of City\u2019s squad for the Club World Cup ahead of a potential move, Grealish has had a long break to relax and refresh.\nThere have been family holidays and trips to Marbella, while he also spent time working on his fitness with a personal trainer. Grealish is set to train with his new team-mates this week, making him available for that season opener at Leeds next Monday, if selected.\nAs stated earlier, he is understood to be desperate to hit the ground running and make an impression.\nEverton will afford him the opportunity to do just that, albeit at considerable cost.\nA gamble worth taking? We\u2019re about to find out.\nWhatever happens, it\u2019s likely to be fun. And Everton fans have not had anywhere near enough of that in recent seasons.\n(Top photo: Everton FC)"

      "text": "One is a beautifully constructed tale of despair and hope, starring England\u2019s latest man of destiny, with cameos from David Beckham, Frank Lampard, Stormzy and Ian Wright, and its soundtrack is one of the most recognisable songs in the world, sung by an iconic musician.\nFilmed in multiple locations and combined with instantly recognisable archive footage, it has been universally praised by industry experts and should win plenty of advertising awards, even if Jude Bellingham, its star, and his England team-mates at this summer\u2019s European Championship do not.\nThe other was shot in a studio in Manchester and features no dialogue, a non-specific setting, some bland music and Jack Grealish, who failed to make England\u2019s squad for Euro 2024 after a lacklustre 2023-24 season for Manchester City.\nIt has been widely ridiculed on social media and in national news outlets.\nBut be honest, how many of you have seen or read about Adidas\u2019 \u201cHey Jude\u201d campaign? And, if you have, how many of you will definitely choose that brand next time you are shopping for a tracksuit?\nNow ask yourself if you have seen or heard about Grealish\u2019s BBQ work for Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise?\nAdvertisement\nOK, this might not work for our readers outside the UK, particularly those of you who live west of the United States\u2019 Rocky Mountains, where Hellmann\u2019s sauces are sold under a different name but the same branding (yes, I have only just discovered this while researching this piece).\nBut if we are measuring the success of these adverts in terms of impact in their home markets, it is Germany 5 Scotland 1 territory and Jack Grill-ish, or maybe G-relish, is doing the cooking.\nFor example, the contrasting nature of the two campaigns was discussed by Richard Osman this week in his podcast, The Rest Is Entertainment, which the author and comedian co-hosts with journalist Marina Hyde. He mentioned Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise but forgot to say which brand Bellingham was advertising.\nThat is the problem with these mini-epics for global sports brands; we instantly recognise the genre but forget the trainers.\n\u201cGrealish not making the team isn\u2019t a big issue for Hellmann\u2019s,\u201d explains Tim Crow, former head of international sports marketing agency Synergy.\n\u201cHellmann\u2019s is a European-wide sponsor, not just England, and this campaign has been going for weeks, so most of the media budget will be already spent. They\u2019ve had their value out of Grealish.\n\u201cPlus, for the \u2018big eventers\u2019 who Hellmann\u2019s is targeting, his selection or non-selection is unlikely to alter their purchase behaviour.\u201d\nCrow\u2019s point about this campaign being bigger than Grealish is a good one, as Hellmann\u2019s is one of dozens of brands owned by Unilever. The British-based multinational signed a sponsorship with UEFA, European football\u2019s governing body, at the end of last year, allowing it to use the Euro 2024 logo to flog its deodorants, sauces and soaps all over Europe.\nThe Hellmann\u2019s campaign, which is based on the simple premise that Europeans like barbecued food and big football tournaments played in their summers, often at the same time, has country-specific versions, featuring Italy\u2019s Federico Chiesa and Germany\u2019s Joshua Kimmich, both of whom did make their national squads for the finals, and former Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Cech and ex-Spain striker David Villa.\nAdvertisement\nVery similar adverts to the one featuring Grealish, a hamburger and some BBQ tongs were shot with the aforementioned quartet in studios in Munich and Turin three months ago.\nAnd while the basic advert is unlikely to win any advertising-industry Oscars, Hellmann\u2019s has been pumping out plenty of additional content, including a \u2018Grilling Grealish\u2019 Q&A with UK sports presenter Laura Woods, in which he reveals his dream guests for a summer BBQ would be England legend Paul Gascoigne, former Aston Villa team-mate John McGinn (in Scotland\u2019s squad at these Euros), current City team-mate Kyle Walker (a senior member of England\u2019s squad) and French great Zinedine Zidane. Presumably, he would only invite Albert Einstein, Helen of Troy and Napoleon to a proper dinner party.\nWoods, by the way, makes a fleeting appearance in the \u201cHey Jude\u201d advert, too (and is also one of the hosts of ITV\u2019s coverage of the tournament on British free-to-air television), so perhaps she is the real, must-have billboard of the British summer.\nHellmann\u2019s declined to comment for this piece, but did so politely and without exuding \u201cwe\u2019re gutted\u201d vibes. In fact, the company seemed pretty happy that lots of us Brits are talking about a condiment made from egg yolk, oil and water. Job done.\nIt should also be noted that advertisers backing the wrong horses is hardly new or unusual.\nBritish consumers are currently being sold Google Pixel phones by Marcus Rashford, supermarket chain Marks & Spencer\u2019s various wares by Ben Chilwell and EE mobile phone and broadband packages by Harry Maguire, none of whom joined Bellingham on England\u2019s plane to the finals in Germany.\n\u201cIt is bad luck,\u201d says AJ Abraham, co-founder of PLUS, a sports and entertainment consultancy based in Manchester. \u201cWhatever is said and done, these guys still have big profiles and massive reach \u2014 that is why the brands chose them.\n\u201cBrands can always make some changes to campaigns but the costs involved prohibit them from pushing the boat out. These campaigns would have been locked out months in advance (of the tournament starting last week), with planning, delivery and then media buys.\u201d\nRicardo Fort, former head of global sponsorships at Coca-Cola and Visa, agrees.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen this many times, and I have been a victim of guesswork,\u201d says Fort.\n\u201cPerhaps the best example of the risks you have to take is the Panini album before every World Cup. They must select and negotiate with the players months before the team is selected, so there are always a few players in the album who do not make the event.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFootballstickershop.com is selling Chilwell stickers from the unofficial Euro 2024 album Panini has produced with Marks & Spencer for just 25p (32 cents).\nAnd the official Euro 2024 album, made by Panini\u2019s rival Topps, has Leicester City\u2019s Luke Thomas in its England squad, despite him not playing once for his parent club last season in the second-tier Championship and also failing to make much of a mark on loan at Sheffield United of the Premier League and then Middlesbrough in the Championship. Topps went for Thomas because Panini had the image rights for all the other left-backs on coach Gareth Southgate\u2019s (very) long list.\nNigel Currie, former chairman of the European Sponsorship Association, is another who makes the \u201cthere but for the grace of God go we\u201d point when it comes to choosing the stars of your ad campaigns, but does wonder if Hellmann\u2019s and Google should perhaps have been paying better attention to the seasons Grealish and Manchester United\u2019s Rashford were having for their clubs, particularly now that England have a few options to choose from to be the face of them.\n\u201cThey are clearly pressing ahead with the campaigns, though, hoping that the players\u2019 profiles and the buzz from the Euros will create the traction they want,\u201d says Currie.\n\u201cBut I suspect there will be some muted disappointment from the agencies and brands involved. The dream scenario is having the player who scores a wondergoal or the winner for England promoting your product.\u201d\nWhat he and all the other experts agree on is how cool it would be if Grealish and Hellmann\u2019s could get the band back together for a second album, so to speak.\n\u201cIf I was the brand, I would pay these guys extra \u2014 if the players are up for it \u2014 to make even more great content and celebrate the England team as a fan,\u201d Abraham says.\nAdvertisement\nRory McEntee, marketing director for British fitness company Gymbox, has posted on LinkedIn urging people to \u201csay a prayer for the (Hellmann\u2019s/Grealish) partnership\u201d and adding \u201clet\u2019s use (LinkedIn) for good and throw them a few ideas to get through this\u201d.\nHe suggested sending Grealish out to Germany to barbecue bratwurst with fans before an England game, while Australian-based brand director Anthony Smith pitched \u201cCondiment Continent\u201d, a campaign based on Grealish visiting the countries England play in the tournament and sampling their sauces.\nAs mentioned, Hellmann\u2019s did not want to get involved in such banter. But I can\u2019t help thinking it has something on the back burner.\nGO DEEPER\nThe Radar - The Athletic's 50 players to watch at Euro 2024\n(Top photo: Richard Sellers/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)"

  "argos_summary": "Jack Grealish's move from Aston Villa to Manchester City for a British record fee of \u00a3100 million has been a mixed journey, marked by significant achievements and personal struggles. While he played a crucial role in City's treble-winning season, his subsequent seasons saw him sidelined, leading to a loan transfer to Everton as he seeks to regain his form and secure a spot in the England national team ahead of the World Cup. The transition to Everton is seen as an opportunity for Grealish to reclaim his status as a key player, allowing him to showcase his talent and creativity that flourished during his time at Villa.",
