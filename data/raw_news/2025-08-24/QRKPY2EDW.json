  "title": "Japan has opened its first osmotic power plant \u2013 so what is it and how does it work?",
  "description": "The site in Fukuoka is only the second power plant of its type in the world, harnessing the power of osmosis to run a desalination plant in the city",
  "content": "Japan has opened its first osmotic power plant, in the south-western city of Fukuoka.\n\nOnly the second power plant of its type in the world, it is expected to generate about 880,000 kilowatt hours of electricity each year \u2013 enough to help power a desalination plant that supplies fresh water to the city and neighbouring areas.\n\nThat\u2019s the equivalent of powering about 220 Japanese households, according to Dr Ali Altaee from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), who specialises in the development of alternative water sources.\n\nWhile it is still an emerging technology being used only on a modest scale as yet, it does have an advantage over some other renewable energies in that it is available around the clock, regardless of the wind or weather or other conditions.\n\nIt relies simply on the mixing of fresh and salt water, so the energy flow can continue day and night, providing a steady source of electricity.\n\nSo what is osmotic power and could it be used elsewhere?\n\nOsmosis is the natural process where water moves across a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated one, in an attempt to balance the concentration on both sides. Picture a cup divided vertically by a thin, semi-permeable layer \u2013 if one side holds salty water and the other side pure freshwater, the water will flow towards the salty side to dilute it, because the salt itself cannot pass through the membrane. Osmotic power plants use this same principle, by placing freshwater and seawater on either side of a special membrane, with the seawater slightly pressurised. As water flows across to the saltier side, it increases the volume of pressurised solution, which can then be harnessed to produce energy. In the Fukuoka facility, fresh water \u2013 or treated wastewater \u2013 and seawater are placed on either side of a membrane. As the side with seawater increases in pressure and decreases in salinity, some of the water is channelled through a turbine that is connected to a generator, producing power. Where else is the technology being used? The Fukuoka plant is the second of its kind in the world. The first one was built in 2023 in Mariager, Denmark, by the venture company SaltPower, said University of Melbourne Prof Sandra Kentish. The Japanese power plant is larger than the one in Denmark, according to Dr Altaee, although they have almost the same operating capacity. Pilot-scale demonstrations have also taken place in Norway and South Korea. Altaee said UTS has its own prototype in Sydney, but the program lost traction during Covid. He has also helped build prototypes in Spain and Qatar. What are the challenges? While the idea is simple, scaling it up is difficult. Kentish said a lot of energy is lost through the action of pumping water into the power plant and when it travels through the membranes. \u201cWhile energy is released when the salt water is mixed with fresh water, a lot of energy is lost in pumping the two streams into the power plant and from the frictional loss across the membranes. This means that the net energy that can be gained is small,\u201d she said. But advances in membrane and pump technology are reducing these problems, Kentish said. \u201cIt is also noteworthy that the Japanese plant uses concentrated seawater, the brine left after removal of fresh water in a desalination plant, as the feed, which increases the difference in salt concentrations and thus the energy available.\u201d What does this mean for the future? Kentish and Altaee agree that the Japanese plant marks an exciting moment for osmotic power, because it offers further proof that the technology can be used for large-scale energy production. Altaee said the prototype plant at Australian university UTS could be restarted if government funding became available, raising its potential for larger-scale implementation in Australia, similar to that of the plant in Fukuoka. \u201cWe have salt lakes around New South Wales and Sydney that could be used as a resource and we also have the expertise to build it.\u201d",

      "text": "Toyobo\u2019s hollow-fiber FO membrane used at world\u2019s first*1 osmotic power plant to help bring next-generation renewable energy system into practical use\nHollow-fiber forward osmosis (FO) membranes manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd. are being used for the world\u2019s first fully functioning osmotic power plant*1 by Danish venture firm SaltPower. The plant is located at Nobians saltworks in Mariager, Denmark. It is scheduled to start operations in April 2023.\nOsmotic power plant\nMechanism of osmotic power generation\nOsmotic power generation uses the osmotic pressure difference between two types of solutions, such as fresh water and salt water, to generate electricity. The system can stably operate regardless of weather, day or night, and can generate power almost at the same cost as solar and wind power generation. For these reasons, it is attracting attention as a next-generation renewable energy power generation system, especially in Europe with its abundant natural resources such as underground rock salt layers and geothermal water.\nThe osmotic power generation plant developed by SaltPower generates about 100kW of power by utilizing the difference in salinity between salt water of almost saturated concentration that is pumped up for use in saltworks from underground rock salt layers*2 and fresh water.\nToyobo\u2019s FO membrane allows water molecules but not molecules or ions above a certain size, such as those for the sodium chloride (salt) compound. So, when high concentration salt water and fresh water come into contact with each other across Toyobo\u2019s FO membrane, their osmotic pressure difference causes water to flow to the salt water side, where the flow rate increases. This increase in flow rate is used to turn a turbine, which generates electricity.\nHollow fiber forward osmosis (FO) membrane\nCross winding structure\nToyobo\u2019s FO membrane is semipermeable, with a cylindrical pressure vessel densely filled with hollow fibers. Thanks to its unique internal structure, which includes cross winding, both high concentration salt water and fresh water flow uniformly inside the FO membrane, and the increase in flow rate resulting from their osmotic pressure difference can be converted into highly efficient power generation.\nToyobo\u2019s FO membrane for osmotic power generation also has excellent pressure resistance achieved by the technology that Toyobo has developed for manufacturing RO membranes for seawater desalination. This means the FO membrane can operate even under high operating pressure required for highly efficient osmotic power generation and maintain high power generation efficiency. Toyobo\u2019s FO membrane has been used in an osmotic power generation pilot plant operated by SaltPower. The pilot plant went through many demonstration tests before going into practical use.\nSaltPower plans to actively promote osmotic power plants using Toyobo\u2019s FO membranes in Europe. Saltwork with solution mining and chlor alkali industry can benefit immediately from the technology. SaltPower also expect that osmotic power will contribute significantly to the green transition by generating energy when building salt caverns for seasonal storage for hydrogen.\nIn collaboration with SaltPower, Toyobo will continue to support the spread of osmotic power generation, which is one of the most promising renewable energy sources of the future. Toyobo will also contribute to solving environmental issues around the world by using its unique hollow fiber membrane technology for desalination plants that operate at low cost and with lower environmental impact, concentration of industrial wastewater and other factors.\n\u25a0 Toyobo\u2019s semipermeable membrane business\nIn the 1970s Toyobo developed a hollow-fiber semipermeable membrane which permeates water molecules, but not molecules and ions above a certain size, by applying a spinning technology Toyobo had developed in its textile production business. Toyobo has been supplying the product to desalination plants for many years as a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane for converting seawater into freshwater. At present, the hollow fiber RO membranes manufactured by the Toyobo Group produce about 1.6 million tons of fresh water per day, which is equivalent to water used by about 6.4 million people.\n| \u203b1\uff1a | The world\u2019s first practical application on a commercial scale, as of February 16, 2022, based on Toyobo data. |\n| \u203b2\uff1a | In saltworks, salt water near saturated concentration water is pumped from underground rock salt layers for producing salt after water is fed from above ground into the salt layers through hydraulic pumps. |\nFor more information, contact\nPublic Relations Group, Corporate Communication Department, Toyobo Co., Ltd.\nMAILpr_g@toyobo.jp\nCautionary Statement\nThis website contains forward-looking statements that reflect Toyobo's plans and expectations.
