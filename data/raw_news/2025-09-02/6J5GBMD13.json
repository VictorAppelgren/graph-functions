  "content": "Ubisoft's \"Star Wars Outlaws\" will be the first big Ubisoft title on Nintendo's new Switch 2 when it launches on Sept 4.\n\nAlthough anticipation is building for the ambitious open-world experience in the galaxy, early performance reports indicate that the game might not be as smooth on the new hardware as fans had been hoping.\n\nAt PAX West 2025, insiders representing GVG got the opportunity to play \"Star Wars Outlaws\" on the Switch 2. Going by their experience, the game was visibly struggling in terms of performance, with the frames falling below 30 FPS more than once. That is especially alarming considering that the game is launching in just a few days, leaving one wondering about the optimization and the title's performance on Nintendo's next-gen console.\n\nGVG outlined how Nintendo revealed the bulk of the Gamescom 2025 lineup at the event, but \"Star Wars Outlaws\" was the sole title not featured in the public display.

Interestingly, there were no open-world stages, which are supposed to be a central element in the final game. Even in those smaller-scale areas, the performance of the game seemed jumpy, with jarring frame drops that left the experience feeling unfinished.\n\nGVG characterized the Switch 2 version as \"kind of rough\" and went on to comment that the performance as a whole was \"pretty poor,\" particularly in light of the forthcoming launch.\n\nWith no video to play back for testing, it's difficult to say how common or extreme these frame rate problems will be, but the comments are already getting under the skin of fans who were expecting smoother performance on Nintendo's new hardware.\n\nWith the window of launch rapidly approaching, the question is whether or not Ubisoft can issue a performance patch in time to stabilize play on the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nFor a game of this magnitude, which depends so much on immersive combat and expansive exploration, smooth frame rates are absolutely essential to player experience.\n\n\"Star Wars Outlaws\" won't have a lasting impression on Switch 2 users if the performance issues persist on its launch.

      "text": "The Switch 2 port of Star Wars Outlaws is reportedly struggling with performance issues, to the extent that media were barred from recording gameplay during a recent showcase. The implication of the Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 edition being in such a bad shape raises concerns about the condition in which it will launch in just a few days.\nThe Switch 2 version of Star Wars Outlaws was officially announced in early April 2025, roughly two months before Nintendo's latest console hit the store shelves. Several weeks later, Ubisoft committed to launching the game on September 4.\nStar Wars Outlaws Nintendo Switch 2 Port Fails To Impress at PAX West\nAs Star Wars Outlaws' release date approaches, the game is said to be in bad shape. That's according to a new report by GVG, stating that media weren't allowed to record gameplay footage while trying the game during the ongoing PAX West 2025, where it is featured at the Nintendo booth. It was reportedly the only upcoming title at the booth with such a restriction. While no official explanation was provided, GVG noted the game ran poorly and speculated this was the reason for the recording ban.\nStar Wars Outlaws Reportedly Drops Below 30fps During Linear Sections\nGoing into the specifics of this \"rough\" performance, GVG found the game to have frequent drops below 30 frames per second. Making matters even more concerning, the PAX West demo featured a linear section of the game on the Imperial Star Destroyer that takes place early on in Star Wars Outlaws. Given the performance issues in such a contained environment, GVG raised doubts about how the final game, which has plenty of large, open-world areas, will run. The demo also included a space battle at the end, which didn't receive any performance-related complaints, though it was labeled as not \"very remarkable\" in terms of visuals.\nGVG noted that the limited ray tracing implementation occasionally looked nice, praising how it affected the appearance of the Stormtrooper armor. Overall, however, it was described as not particularly impressive, with character lighting\u2014and especially hair\u2014criticized as looking flat. The YouTube channel's all-around impressions weren't positive, raising concerns about the state in which the port will be released. Although Star Wars Outlaws launched with some problematic bugs and had a tendency to crash in certain areas like Tatooine (mostly just on PC) before receiving several critical patches, its overall performance on non-Nintendo platforms wasn't viewed as particularly problematic.\nWhile it's possible\u2014and even likely\u2014that the PAX West demo was using an older build of Star Wars Outlaws rather than the one that will launch on September 4, it's uncertain whether the differences between the two will be significant. The newly emerged performance complaints align with what little was shown of the port to date, with the gameplay footage featured on the Star Wars Outlaws Nintendo eShop page looking rather rough and choppy.\nStar Wars Outlaws\n- OpenCritic Reviews\n- Top Critic Avg: 75/100 Critics Rec: 68%\n- Released\n- August 30, 2024\n- ESRB\n- T For Teen // Violence, Simulated Gambling, Mild Language\n- Developer(s)\n- Massive Entertainment\n- Publisher(s)\n- Ubisoft, Lucasfilm Games\n- Engine\n- Snowdrop\nYour comment has not been saved"

      "text": "\"Warframe\" gamers know that it's time for this title to get a native Nintendo experience with a new Switch port.\nThis might take some time as developer Digital Extremes confirmed they had yet to receive a Switch 2 development kit. This holds back development on an upgraded version of the free-to-play first-person shooter.\nWhat Happened to 'Warframe' Switch 2 Dev Kit\nDiscussing in a press Q&A session with Eurogamer, Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair mentioned his team's enthusiasm for the fresh hardware\u2014alongside frustration at being queued up.\n\"Our tech team is so excited to take advantage of the [Switch 2's] high-speed cores and the other really cool features of it, [but] there's just such a backlog for dev kits.\nI know our programmers are just like, 'Oh, I can't wait' so we definitely have plans. And when we get a dev kit we'll be doing a custom build for Warframe, absolutely.\"\n'Warframe' is a Must-Add Game on Switch 2\nThe dream of seeing \"Warframe\" in a more advanced Nintendo console is what the fans want to see soon. However, even its current Switch version is working, but with a catch. Unfortunately, gamers are greeted with technical limitations including crashes and errors.\nAccording to Notebookcheck, a Switch 2 iteration would unchain:\n- Improved graphics\n- Glossier frame rates\n- Pointer capabilities on Joy-Con\n- Load times accelerated\n- Responsiveness in UI\nBackward Compatibility: The Temporary Fix\nDigital Extremes knows about the problems and is currently looking into them.\nNonetheless, it shows the imperative need for a solid Switch 2 build to provide a smooth player experience.\nDev Kit Bottlenecks Affect Multiple Studios\nDigital Extremes is not alone in waiting. Smaller firms such as Ant Workshop and Fellow Traveller Games are also waiting on the Switch 2 dev kit, likely because of limited hardware distribution by Nintendo.\nLarger studios like CD Projekt Red and FromSoftware already possess kits and are actively developing games like \"Cyberpunk 2077\" and \"Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition\" for Switch 2.\n\"Warframe\" is one of the games dealing with startup issues on Switch 2. Other notable games in the list include \"Little Nightmares Complete Edition,\"\"NieR: Automata The End of YoRHa Edition,\" and \"South Park: The Fractured but Whole.\"\nIt's painful for the Switch 2 players to endlessly hope for a good port for \"Warframe. The backward-compatible version is just painful to see. But if everything goes according to plan, \"Warframe's\" fully optimized next-gen iteration could be right around the corner."

      "text": "A new rumor is now suggesting that \"Starfield's\" PlayStation 5 port may be announced in several weeks. Microsoft has previously confirmed that it is focusing on giving the world more of Xbox's iconic games, with an announcement of \"Starfield\" for PS5 speculated to arrive in this year's Gamescom event.\nPreviously, Bethesda's \"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\" was ported to the rivaling console from Sony, giving all PS5 players a chance to also explore as Indy despite it being initially exclusive to the Xbox Series S and X.\n'Starfield' for PS5 Rumors: Gamescom 2025 Reveal\nA well-known and trusted leaker named Detective Seeds has shared news on X, claiming that they are expecting to see a \"Starfield\" PlayStation 5 version announcement in the upcoming Gamescom 2025 event.\nThe leaker did not share much information apart from this, but it has already given fans more hope regarding the game's arrival on the rivaling console.\nDetective Seeds did not mention any other sources that could corroborate their claims, but the leaker only said that they \"would not be shocked\" to see an announcement regarding the space game's port to the PS5.\nTo date, this rumor remains a speculation, so it is best to take a grain of salt, according to ComicBook Gaming's report.\nOfficial Confirmation, Release Date Coming Soon?\nDetective Seeds also mentioned a possible release date for this port that is coming later this year. The leaker claims that it would most likely take place by November as it would opt to avoid \"The Outer Worlds 2's\" release date, which is already set for October.\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, the latest information is all based on speculations and rumors. As of press time, it remains unconfirmed if Bethesda, Microsoft, or Xbox have worked on porting the game to Sony's PlayStation 5, similar to what it did for \"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.\"\nThat being said, ComicBook Gaming also claimed that there is a possibility that \"Starfield\" will get a feature on Gamescom 2025, but it will only reportedly announce its next DLC, which has also been heavily rumored."

      "text": "A new report reveals that Ubisoft has canceled the planned \"Star Wars Outlaws\" sequel game that is already in the pipeline, and this information came only months after the original title was released.\nIt is known that the game already faced significant challenges during its development as it was transferred from Electronic Arts to Ubisoft, with the company not being able to deliver once it released the title.\nUbisoft Cancels 'Star Wars Outlaws' Sequel\nInsider and gaming journalist Tom Henderson (via ComicBook Gaming) has revealed that the proposed sequel to \"Star Wars Outlaws\" will no longer happen as it was recently canceled. Ubisoft, the game's publisher, has not yet confirmed any news regarding a second game to continue the series, yet it is already being reported that it has been canceled by the company.\nHenderson noted that Ubisoft and the game's developer, Massive Entertainment, did not begin any major work regarding a \"Star Wars Outlaws\" sequel, with the game failing to reach full production. This means that the game previously entered the early stages of development under the studios, but it may not have pushed through because of the significant scrutiny it faced.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game has yet to be released, but per speculations from ComicBook Gaming, sales on this platform may not be enough to push Ubisoft into revisiting its sequel plans.\nIs It Because of 'Star Wars Outlaws' Flop?\n\"Star Wars Outlaws\" was released last August for Windows PCs via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and game streaming platforms, featuring an original action-adventure story set in the franchise's world.\nThe game is widely considered a flop due to its poor story, a not-so impactful lead character, with ComicBook Gaming also regarding that its gameplay is not that \"fun.\"\nIt was revealed that players did not heavily connect with the game's story and characters. While it presented an open-world-esque \"Star Wars\" experience, it lacked in storytelling and did not make an impact with its direction.\nUbisoft took the reins in developing this original \"Star Wars\" game, but the \"Assassin's Creed\" makers were not able to capitalize on it.\nAs per Henderson, Ubisoft is already giving up on creating \"Star Wars\" games as of writing, but it remains unconfirmed if the studio still has plans for future installments outside \"Star Wars Outlaws.\""
