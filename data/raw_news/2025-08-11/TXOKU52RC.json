  "content": "Former Brooklyn hoops star Sebastian Telfair is calling on President Donald Trump to give him a last-second pardon before he has to report to prison on Tuesday to serve out a six-month sentence.\n\nTelfair, who starred for Abraham Lincoln High School in Coney Island and bounced around the NBA, allegedly failed to satisfy the terms of a plea bargain related to a healthcare fraud case he was wrapped up in, and decided to make a last-ditch plea to Trump during an interview with TMZ.\n\n\u201cTrump, go check in on my story and you\u2019re definitely going to want to pardon me,\u201d he said during the interview on the streets of New York. \u201cYou\u2019ll hold me accountable and want me to continue to go do good. But I did too good to being sending anybody to jail.\u201d\n\nTelfair called the situation \u201csuper unfair\u201d and told the outlet that he was \u201cmad\u201d he had to spend time in federal jail.\n\nThe former high school basketball star said that it had been an issue with paperwork that led to the current situation he finds himself in.\n\n\u201cI know Donald Trump\u2019s got some big things going on, but Donald Trump, I need you to come holla\u2019 \u2026 give your boy a pardon so I could stay home with my baby,\u201d Telfair said while talking to TMZ.\n\nTelfair had been among a number of ex-NBA players who were alleged to have run a scheme to try and cheat the league\u2019s health care plan out of nearly $4 million back in 2021.\n\nHe was first sentenced to time served plus supervised release for three years, but this summer he was re-sentenced to six months in jail for failing to abide by the terms of his release.\n\nTelfair did try to put a positive spin on the situation, saying that he has plans to write a book and he was documenting his story.\n\nHe played 10 seasons in the NBA, with stops in Minnesota, Portland, Phoenix, Boston, Los Angeles, Oklahoma City, Toronto and Cleveland after becoming a rare guard to make the jump straight from high school. He was drafted No.13 overall by the Timberwolves in 2004.",

The allegations were first reported in 2017 by German magazine Der Spiegel.\nUS District Judge Jennifer Dorsey dismissed the case with prejudice, due to misconduct by Mayorga\u2019s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, who used \u201cpurloined\u201d confidential documents.\nStovall was ordered to pay a proportion of Ronaldo\u2019s legal costs."
