  "content": "HARRISBURG \u2014 Senate Republicans are considering pulling $592 million over two years from money designated for ongoing or planned transit capital projects to help fund SEPTA operations as the transit agency prepares deep service cuts in the state\u2019s most populous region.\n\nSEPTA officials said they oppose the idea and that it would create the potential for safety problems while making its overall fiscal situation worse.\n\nThe package would take $419 million from the capital side of the Public Transportation Trust Fund and add $173 million over two years from gaming-tax revenues to the trust fund, which would also go to transit systems.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Not just SEPTA: Public transit is in trouble all across Pennsylvania, including in GOP districts\n\nScott Sauer, SEPTA\u2019s general manager, said on Tuesday that the proposal \u201cmight plug the hole, the immediate need to just continue to run service, but it creates new problems with our capital budget ... an already oversubscribed, underfunded program.\u201d\n\nSEPTA has not said whether the state Senate\u2019s action, if approved, would forestall the planned cuts and fare increase that are scheduled to go into effect beginning Aug. 24.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D., Montgomery) both said they oppose the plan, so the issue is far from resolved by Tuesday\u2019s Senate action.\n\nManuel Bonder, a spokesperson for the governor, said Shapiro, a Democrat, \u201cappreciates Senate Republicans finally acknowledging the need to fund mass transit systems across the Commonwealth,\u201d but that it doesn\u2019t do enough.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly not a serious, long-term proposal that can pass both chambers,\u201d Bonder added. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get back to the table and keep working at it.\u201d\n\nLeaders in the House, which is controlled by Democrats, and Shapiro have insisted on five years of new funding for SEPTA and other transit systems, even as the Senate GOP began moving toward a temporary fix.\n\nThe move likely means that the state\u2019s seven-week budget impasse continues.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

Will it have transit funding?\nMass transit funding \u2014 and how to pay for it \u2014 remains among the top sticking points between the GOP-controlled Senate, Shapiro, and House Democrats in reaching a final budget deal.\nHARRISBURG \u2014 The Pennsylvania state Senate is poised to return to Harrisburg on Tuesday to advance a short-term budget \u2014 against the will of Democratic officials \u2014 as closed-door negotiations drone on into a seventh week past the budget deadline and leaders face an urgent SEPTA funding deadline.\nAs of Monday evening, Senate Republicans appeared to be on track to consider a short-term state budget on Tuesday afternoon that would allow the state to send out its payments to school districts, counties, and other state-subsidized services while leaders negotiate a final budget deal, according to a source close to the plans.\nThe Senate\u2019s plans were not finalized as of Monday evening, and remained unclear whether the Senate action would include additional funding for public transit, as SEPTA stares down a Thursday deadline before a 20% service cut is implemented later this month.\nSenate Majority Leader Joe Pittman hinted at a short-term budget plan in a statement Monday afternoon, explaining that the Senate would return Tuesday \u201cto consider options to address the consequences of a budget impasse.\u201d\nPittman said the Senate would return in response to the \u201cpolitical rhetoric\u201d from Gov. Josh Shapiro at a news conference on Sunday outside SEPTA headquarters, and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford\u2019s \u201cperformance session\u201d in the state House, which on Monday passed another transit funding bill, 108-95, with one Democrat opposing the bill and seven GOP members voting in support.\nThe efforts, Pittman said, \u201cdid nothing to advance a commonsense solution to help all Pennsylvanians.\u201d\nShapiro and Bradford, who are the top budget negotiators at the table with Pittman, in their individual remarks Sunday and Monday repeated most of the same calls for the Senate to pass transit funding to avoid SEPTA cuts.\nSenate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R., Westmoreland) also floated last week that the Senate could send a short-term budget to the House if they don\u2019t reach a deal soon.\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t come to an agreement on the budget in the next week or so, and we send a stopgap budget and the governor refuses to sign it, then all those entities, and all of those schools that don\u2019t get funded, will be on the governor,\u201d Ward said in an interview.\nBoth Shapiro and Bradford have opposed a short-term budget, adding that they are already more than a month late on a budget and don\u2019t want to kick these issues down the road.\nBradford has emphasized that the House has made every change the Senate GOP has requested \u2014 albeit, without a funding mechanism that the Senate GOP supports \u2014 to secure support from their caucus, with no proof of what they\u2019d support.\n\u201cWe need to see what [the Senate] can pass,\u201d Bradford told reporters Monday after the House passed transit funding for a fifth time in two legislative sessions. \u201cBut the governor has been very clear that is not going to get the job done. They have an obligation to pass a year budget. They have yet to do that. \u2026 They need to show what they have 26 votes for.\u201d\nPublic transit funding \u2014 and how to pay for it \u2014 remains among the top sticking points among the GOP-controlled Senate, Shapiro, and House Democrats in reaching a final budget deal. Other sticking points include how much to tax so-called skill games, Medicaid spending, and more. The state budget was due by July 1, the start of the fiscal year ,and a late budget requires counties and school districts to secure additional financing until state funding is released."

      "text": "SEPTA service cuts will happen if state money isn\u2019t secured next week\nThe transit agency says it needs to know about funding by Aug. 14.\nSEPTA needs new state funding by Aug. 14 to prevent a planned round of deep service cuts from taking effect near the end of the month, transit agency officials said.\nThe agency plans to announce the deadline at a news conference Wednesday morning, along with online posting of new fall schedules that reflect a 20% overall cut in transit service.\nIf the state money doesn\u2019t come through, 32 bus routes will be eliminated and 16 others shortened beginning Aug. 24, along with reductions in the frequency of bus, trolley, subway and Regional Rail trips.\nFares would also rise by 21.5% on Sept. 1.\nThe deadline, in theory, might spur progress in state-budget negotiations in Harrisburg, but SEPTA officials said their motivation was to provide clarity to thousands of riders now looking to make travel plans.\n\u201cWe just want to be transparent,\u201d said Jody Holton, chief planning and strategy officer at SEPTA. \u201cPeople might assume Aug. 24 is our deadline, but it\u2019s not. It takes at least 10 days \u2026to implement the systems.\u201d\nAmong other things, new schedule information needs to be programmed into SEPTA\u2019s rail signal system and control room, and to update the GPS tracks where buses are supposed to be, along with signage identifying buses, she said.\n\u00bb READ MORE: From alerting riders to changing Google Maps, here\u2019s how SEPTA is preparing for service cuts\nEarlier, SEPTA had figured it would take up to three weeks to make the necessary changes before cutting.\n\u201cWe pared down the time frame to be as short as possible,\u201d Holton said.\nThe state budget is more than a month overdue. Transit funding is one of the issues holding up a deal between Senate Republicans, House Democrats, and Gov. Josh Shapiro. Senate Republicans hold the balance of power.\nSenate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) and most Senate GOP members have resisted giving more to SEPTA, saying they see the transit authority as mismanaged and needs to be held accountable for fare evasion and public safety.\nSEPTA already receives $1 billion from the state annually, 67% of its operating budget.\nThe planned cuts will be paused if enough money is received before midnight Aug. 14, SEPTA says.\nThe transit agency faces a $213 million recurring deficit in its operating budget, and other transit agencies around the state face their own fiscal crises.\nShapiro has proposed $292 million in new money for mass transit over five years. SEPTA estimates it would get about $168 million, which would, with other measures, enable it to close the gap and get by.\nIf state money comes or is assured after Aug. 24, it will take at least 10 days to rewind the cuts and get normal service running again, officials said."

      "text": "SEPTA can\u2019t afford some infrastructure projects, including 22 that would help people with mobility issues, the agency says\nThe transit authority said it\u2019s $3 billion short on funding due to the rising costs of construction.\nDisappearing bus routes, five fewer Regional Rail lines, subway and commuter trains not running late \u2014 these and other possible SEPTA service cuts have dominated discussion of the transit authority\u2019s latest budget problems.\nBut SEPTA is also squeezed on the capital side of the ledger.\nIts draft spending plan would defer or scale back 44 planned infrastructure projects because of a $3 billion gap between the costs of the work and available funding.\n\u201cMajor construction cost increases in our industry are forcing us to defer projects,\u201d Brian McFadden, director of capital budgets for SEPTA, said in an interview.\nRiders might not notice some of the delayed projects, but the largest single category of them are modifications to make stations accessible to people with disabilities and mobility challenges.\nMore than 20 such Americans with Disabilities Act projects costing about $556 million and scheduled over the next 12 years will be deferred.\nThe work was scheduled for Regional Rail Stations, transportation centers, a station on the Norristown High Speed Line, as well as several stops on the Broad Street Line.\n\u201cThis is not what we want to do. We have tremendous needs on the ADA accessibility front throughout our system,\u201d McFadden said.\nOfficials said the accessibility projects can be postponed more readily than safety-related ones. The capital budget is tweaked yearly, and projects can be added back, they said.\nOverall, SEPTA plans to save $1.8 billion by pausing projects and reducing the scope of others, and to borrow $1.2 billion by issuing bonds, beginning in 2028. That will keep some urgent projects moving forward.\nSEPTA schedules and funds major infrastructure projects in 12-year time periods, paying installments toward the work, much of which takes several years.\nOverdue investments to replace 40- and 50-year-old railcar fleets can no longer be delayed, and that needs to be funded to keep them on track.\nThe transit system has ordered new cars for the Market-Frankford Line, an urgent need. The El cars are old and prone to breaking down. It also has new trolleys in the pipeline and has allocated money to begin upgrading tracks and building new, ADA-accessible trolley stations that will eventually replace corner stops.\nTo prepare for the new vehicles, other infrastructure has to be installed, including a $400 million overhaul of the MFL\u2019s signal system.\nSEPTA also points out that it gets less money for infrastructure projects from local governments in its service area than other systems, such as Boston\u2019s, because Pennsylvania law doesn\u2019t allow counties the option to levy a dedicated fee or tax for transit.\nCosts for construction of transportation projects has risen about 62% over the past four years, according to the United States Department of Transportation\u2019s statistics bureau. The calculations were based on highway projects, but transit work is rising along with them.\nOf course, materials and wages are more expensive, but there\u2019s a surprising factor in high costs: the federal infrastructure act.\nIt poured so much money into roads, bridges, and transit that contractors have been stretched thin \u2014 a situation that Erik Johanson, SEPTA\u2019s director of budgets and infrastructure, calls \u201coversaturation.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all competing against each other for those vendors, so we\u2019re seeing fewer competitive bids and higher prices,\u201d McFadden said.\nNot that they are complaining about the infrastructure spending. It\u2019s helped transit agencies and highway departments alike.\nThe infrastructure law is scheduled to expire next year, so SEPTA officials say they expect less money as funds are spent down."
