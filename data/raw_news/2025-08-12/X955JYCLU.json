  "content": "Apple has denied Elon Musk's accusation that it's favoring OpenAI in its App Store rankings and making it impossible for other AI companies to reach the top. In a statement sent to Bloomberg, Apple said the App Store is \"designed to be fair and free of bias.\" The company's spokesperson explained that the App Store features \"thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.\" They added: \"Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories.\"\n\nxAI founder Elon Musk accused Apple of \"unequivocal antitrust violation\" by favoring OpenAI in a post on X, warning that his company \"will take immediate legal action.\" In a separate post from his threat, he asked Apple why it \"[refuses] to put either X or Grok in [its] 'Must Have' section.\" X, he said, is \"the #1 news app in the world,\" while Grok is ranked number five among all apps. \"Are you playing politics? What gives?\" he continued.\n\nMusk didn't provide evidence to back his accusations. It's also worth noting that Chinese AI app DeepSeek reached the top of Apple's free app rankings back in January, overtaking even ChatGPT. As X's own Community Notes also mentioned in Musk's post, added hours after it went up, Perplexity reached the top of overall rankings in India's App Store back in July. Both apps were able to reach the top of their respective lists way after Apple and OpenAI announced their partnership last year.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's accusation, as well. He said it's a \"remarkable claim,\" given that he has heard allegations that Musk manipulates \"X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like.\" In response, Musk posted: \"Scam Altman lies as easily as he breathes.\"",

      "text": "Apple seems to have persuaded OpenAI to work for exposure\nNo money changed hands in the Apple and OpenAI deal, Bloomberg reports.\nAt Apple's recently concluded annual conference for developers, the company announced that it teamed up with OpenAI to bring its technology to the iPhone and its other devices. It's easy to imagine a huge amount of money changing hands in a deal between a massive corporation and a fast-rising tech firm. But according to a new Bloomberg report, nobody paid anybody in that partnership. Apple is reportedly not paying OpenAI, because it believes that putting its technology in front of hundreds of millions of users is equal to or even better than any kind of monetary payment.\nApple will use OpenAI's GPT-4o model to power AI tasks on iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri, for instance, will tap into ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities if users ask it to create menu ideas, to summarize articles or to find photos based on a description of what they contain. Apple's writing tools can also use ChatGPT to write stories, as well as to rewrite and proofread existing text. Users will be able to enjoy these features without having to log into or pay for ChatGPT, but they do get access to extra perks if they pay for a Plus account.\nAs Bloomberg points out, OpenAI could make money from the deal by convincing Apple users to pay $20 a month for ChatGPT Plus. And if those users sign up on an Apple device, then the iPhone-maker will also get a commission. In the future, Apple intends to generate more earnings from AI by getting into revenue-sharing agreements with its partners, the news organization says. It's aiming to get a cut of what those partners will earn from monetizing results in chatbots on Apple's operating systems, in particular, because it believes more and more users will turn to AI over search engines. That means it could earn less money from its long-standing (and lucrative) search deal with Google.\nApple has yet to reveal its future AI partners, but it's reportedly in talks with Google to offer Gemini integration to iOS users as soon as later this year. It's also reportedly talking to Anthropic to offer its Claude AI chatbot as another option."

      "text": "Elon Musk feels Apple favors OpenAI over xAI in App Store rankings\nHe has not provided evidence to support his threat of legal action.\nElon Musk has accused Apple of committing an \"unequivocal antitrust violation\" by favoring OpenAI in the App Store rankings. In a post on X, he claimed that Apple has made it impossible for other AI companies to reach number one in those rankings and that xAI \"will take immediate legal action.\" Musk didn't clarify what he meant by that, and he also didn't provide evidence that would prove Apple's supposed antitrust violation.\nIn an earlier post on X that's currently pinned to the top of his profile, however, he tagged Apple, asking the company why it \"[refuses] to put either X or Grok in [its] \"Must Have\" section. He said X is \"the #1 news app in the world,\" while Grok is ranked number five among all apps. \"Are you playing politics? What gives?\" he continued.

The company has integrated ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence to power cloud-based queries for its platforms. More recently, the company said that Apple Intelligence will leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-5 in iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, which are set to arrive sometime in September.\nUpdate, August 12, 2025, 8PM ET: This story has been updated to add Microsoft's statement."

      "text": "China\u2019s DeepSeek AI assistant becomes top free iPhone app as US tech stocks take a hit\nIt requires far less computing power than rivals like OpenAI, according to the developer.\nChinese AI assistant DeepSeek has become the top rated free app on Apple's App Store in the US and elsewhere, beating out ChatGPT and other rivals. It's powered by the open-source DeepSeek V3 model, which reportedly requires far less computing power than competitors and was developed for under $6 million, according to (disputed) claims by the company. At the same time, it offers performance that's on par with Claude-3.5, GPT-4o and other rivals, DeepSeek said last week.\nThe news that DeepSeek topped the App Store charts caused a sharp drop in tech stocks like NVIDIA and ASML this morning. Google parent company Alphabet and Microsoft were also down this morning. As the New York Times notes, the overall Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropped as well, and markets in Europe and Japan also took a bit of a hit.\nAvailable on web, app and API, DeepSeek is similar to AI Assistant like ChatGPT with features like coding content creation and research. Its first DeepSeek-R1 release is available under an MIT license, so it can be used commercially and without restrictions.\nThe company is headquartered in Hangzhou, China and was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who also launched the hedge fund backing DeepSeek. To develop the tech, he reportedly stockpiled NVIDIA A100 chips prior to the US export ban and paired those with less powerful chips that can still be imported, according to MIT Technology Review.\nHowever, DeepSeek was still at a significant hardware disadvantage next to rival models from OpenAI, Google and others. That forced the company to be more efficient with its AI models, and it has supposedly been able to build and train them at a far lower cost than previously thought possible.\nAnalysts from Citi and elsewhere have questioned those claims, though, and pointed out that China is a \"more restrictive environment\" for AI development than the US. Still, the rise of DeepSeek has raised concerns about the potential profits of rivals like OpenAI that have already invested billions in AI infrastructure.\nAll the attention today around DeepSeek appears to have attracted some bad actors, though. According to CNBC, DeepSeek says it is temporarily limiting registrations for the service in light of \"large-scale malicious attacks.\" Existing users should be able to log in as usual, however. But if all the buzz around the tool made you want to check it out, you might have to be patient.\nUpdate, January 27 2025, 11:47AM ET: This story has been updated with details on the cyber-attack on DeepSeek that has limited registrations for the service.\nUpdate, January 27 2025, 11:27AM ET: This story and its headline were updated with more details on the stock price drops that appear to have hit this morning in conjunction with the news around DeepSeek.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."
