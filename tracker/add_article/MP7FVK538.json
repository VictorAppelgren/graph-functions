      "summary": "Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup in early September, with rumors pointing to a new ultra‑thin iPhone 17 Air, a titanium‑framed Air, and a redesigned Pro series featuring a larger camera island and aluminum chassis. The devices will ship with the new A19 chip, 12‑GB RAM for the Pro models, and iOS 26, which introduces a Liquid Glass design, live translation, and AI‑powered Visual Intelligence. Pricing is expected to rise by about $50 across the lineup to offset rising component costs and tariffs, while Apple plans to launch the event on September 9. The iPhone 17 is also likely to be accompanied by new Apple Watch models, AirPods Pro updates, and a refreshed HomePod Mini. Overall, the launch is poised to showcase Apple’s continued focus on AI integration and hardware refinement amid a shifting supply‑chain landscape.",
