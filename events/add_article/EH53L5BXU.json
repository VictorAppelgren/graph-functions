      "title": "Bankrupt Claire’s Is Headed Toward Liquidation If No Buyer Found",
      "summary": "Claire’s Stores, Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, outlining a plan to close 700 of its North American stores—including all Icing and Walmart shop‑in‑shop locations—and either sell the remaining 800 stores or liquidate the business, with experts deeming a sale unlikely. CEO Chris Cramer attributes the decline to a shift away from brick‑and‑mortar retail, a heavy debt load, and rising tariffs on imported inventory, while the company’s e‑commerce platform and concession model have underperformed. Competitors such as Lovisa, Rowan, Ulta and Five Below have captured market share, and the company’s past restructuring in 2018 eliminated $1.9 billion of debt but has not prevented a downward spiral. Analysts from Debtwire and GlobalData warn that without a buyer, liquidation is the most probable outcome, and that a successful turnaround would be difficult in the current retail environment.",
