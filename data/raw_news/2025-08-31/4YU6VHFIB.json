  "title": "What's Driving the Red-Hot IPO Market",
  "description": "Jeff Thomas, Nasdaq Chief Revenue Officer and Global Head of Listings Capital Access Platforms, Executive Vice President, tells Open Interest that regulatory clarity, the Fed leaning towards an accommodative stance, and the strength of recent public listings are driving even more IPOs. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Leaving aside 21 because that was just off the charts, Right? This is incredible. And what's what's driving it. So I think we measure something called the IPO Pulse Index at NASDAQ, where we correlate macroeconomic factors with internal NASDAQ data. And the index is now showing at an all time high relative to everything except 2021. As we come through Q2, we saw a little bit of a pullback. There was some macro uncertainty. People weren't quite certain about it, but since we've gotten a little bit more regulatory clarity, feels like the Fed's going to be a little bit more accommodative. I think everybody is ready to start running. And then you just look at the performance of recent deals and things have been doing really well and that's always what leads to more deals. And I'll say, Jeff, there does feel a little bit of an element of two step forward, one step back, and the step back being companies that just don't want to be public or even take profits that are happening. There's one today from the Nasdaq variant that Thomas Bravo is taking private as this happens. How big of a blow is it to the exchange to have companies? Yes, IPOs are coming back, but a large swath that frankly don't want to be public or are public and would rather change to be private? Yeah, I mean, there has been a macro trend over the last ten years of companies staying private longer. And what's really driven that is the availability of capital in the private market ecosystem. And so we've been investing heavily at NASDAQ to create solutions to support not only the public markets but also the private markets. But when we look ahead at which companies are coming to market, obviously there's a lot of excitement around technology companies. Anything to do around fintech and cryptocurrencies are really exciting. And we do start to see some private equity backed companies looking to come to market this fall because even if companies get taken private, a lot of these companies are big enough that the private equity sponsors are going to need to tap the public markets to create some liquidity. I got to ask, one of the things that I guess I harp on on this show is when companies leave money on the table, you must talk to bankers, right? When they're pricing figma or circle or core weave, why don't they do a better job? So I think, you know, when I talk to the CFOs of companies that are going public, they are very mindful about the expectations they're setting with the investors that they're selling the shares to at their IPO. So at any given valuation, you're implying a certain set of growth and profitability expectations into the future. And I think that's one thing that people oftentimes they worry about the money they're leaving on the table on day one. But for the CFO, it's really about what's the expectation they're setting with those new investors in terms of where their growth and profitability is going to get in the coming year. But do you want to see a 100% pop? Is that necessarily a good thing? I think it's really hard to kind of handicap the markets right now because there's so much excitement around some of these deals, around some of the new issues. You have seen a couple of the companies with these big pops trading back. And what's interesting, you know, as you look at the stock chart, you're always measured to that day one opening price as opposed to the IPO price. It just doesn't show up. True. So even if you pull back a little bit, you may still be well up over the IPO price, which is really that commitment you made to those IPO buyers that, hey, here's what we think the company's fairly valued and here's the expectations we want to set. Well, how much of this is also just about the fact that since April, volatility has been sacked from this market? If you see a re-emergence of volatility, which means your first day of trading could be even more painful and even more sporadic, do you expect the pace of what we've seen of offerings to slow down? I do think volatility is definitely one of those factors that we're looking at in that IPO pulse index. And like you said, that's way down. Valuations are way up. And I think now you're just really looking at things like investor sentiment. And again, the Fed funds rate, once those things come a little bit more in line, I think we're going to continue to see a lot of excitement around the IPO market. What what's the quality of these IPOs? Because we mentioned 2021 and I think you had like 700 IPOs that year, but a lot of them are SPACs. Yeah, right. And that seems to have died off now. It's come back to some extent. I think you might have 40, 50 SPACs in your total this this year, even more so in the first half. We raised over $10 billion for SPAC. So we do think that that's a part of the going public process that's going to come back. We're not back at the levels that we saw back in 2021. But in general, what we see in terms of companies coming public today, the companies have larger revenue, more of them are profitable or have a good path to profitability. So I think investors are being much more rational and the companies just are much more substantial. So even when you look at SPAC business combinations of which we've had 30 already this year, the companies generally have a lot higher revenue and profitability than they did previously. And so one of those things, though, when SPACs are coming back, when the King of SPACs, Chamath Palihapitiya, puts one into the market, people love to say market top or when you see meme stock trading taking up 10% from one individual stock of all trading of an exchange, people worry about froth. How do you gauge the health of this equity market right now? Yeah, I think when we kind of look at it, we're really focused on three aspects of the market. It's liquidity, transparency and integrity. And we've been doing a lot of. Work with the new administration and the new FCC to say, what can we do to create a better environment, to bring more companies to market? Because ultimately, the more companies that come to market, the more opportunities that everyday Americans have to invest in the U.S. stock market, participate in those gains. And that's really the other side of the topic we talked about before. As companies stay private longer, then there's just fewer of those opportunities for everyday Americans to participate in that growth. And so I'll say, you know, the administration has definitely put out a pro-growth agenda. And the new FCC is definitely leaning in and looking for ways to help us, you know, bring more of those companies to market. By the way, meme stocks, did you see the UBS basket jumped more than 7% on Friday? I guess cuts are good for me, myself. I'll help them out. That was the biggest jump or hitting an all time high watt in terms of retail participation, in terms of lock up structures, what are you seeing now or what's different about this market than 2021? Yeah, I'd say in general, obviously they're like I said, a lot more companies have significant revenue and profitability in terms of the sectors that we see really a lot of interest in right now. Technology with a big focus on cybersecurity, fintech with a big focus on anything around crypto and blockchain. And again, we're starting to see a lot of these private equity sponsored back deals of significant size coming to market together. And I think those trends, a lot of those are areas that retail investors are interested in, especially in the crypto and fintech space.",
