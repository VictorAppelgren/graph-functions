  "title": "Current mortgage rates report for Aug. 29, 2025: Rates flicker slightly up after dip",
  "description": "Compare average mortgage rates on different types of home loans so you can pick the best mortgage for your needs as you house shop.",
  "content": "The average interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgage loan in the U.S. is 6.548%, according to data available from mortgage data company Optimal Blue. That\u2019s up approximately 2 basis points from the prior day\u2019s report, and down approximately 8 basis points from a week ago. Read on to compare average rates for a variety of conventional and government-backed mortgage types and see whether rates have increased or decreased. Note that Fortune reviewed Optimal Blue\u2019s latest available data on Aug. 28, with the numbers reflecting home loans locked in as of Aug. 27. If it feels as though 30-year mortgage rates have been stuck on the verge of 7% for an extended period, that\u2019s not too far off. Many observers anticipated that rates would soften when the Federal Reserve started reducing the federal funds rate last September, but there was no sustained decrease in mortgage rates. There was a short-lived dip preceding the September Fed meeting, but rates rapidly climbed afterward. By January 2025 the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage surpassed 7% for the first time since last May, as indicated by Freddie Mac data. That\u2019s a big jump from the historic average low of 2.65% recorded in January 2021, when the government was still working to stimulate the economy and ward off a pandemic-induced economic downturn. Absent another major crisis, experts agree we won\u2019t have mortgage rates in the 2% to 3% range in our lifetimes. Nevertheless, rates around the 6% mark are entirely possible if the U.S. manages to tame inflation and lenders feel optimistic about the economic prospects. In fact, rates had a modest decline at the end of February, dropping nearer to the 6.5% mark than had been seen for some time. There was even a brief point in early April where rates dipped below 6.5%, but they rose immediately afterward. At present, with uncertainty as to the extent to which President Donald Trump will pursue policies such as tariffs and deportations, some observers worry the labor market could constrict and inflation could resurface. Against this backdrop, U.S. homebuyers face high mortgage rates\u2014although some can still find options for making their purchase more manageable, like negotiating rate buydowns with a builder when purchasing newly constructed property.\n\nHow to get the best mortgage rate you can While economic conditions are beyond your control, your financial profile as an applicant also has a substantial impact on the mortgage rate you\u2019re offered. With that in mind, aim to do the following:\n\u2022 Make sure you have excellent credit. The minimum credit score for a conventional mortgage is generally 620 (for FHA loans, you may qualify with a score of 580 or a score as low as 500 with a 10% down payment). However, if you\u2019re hoping to get a low rate that could potentially save you five or even six figures in interest over the life of your loan, you\u2019ll want a score considerably higher. For instance, lender Blue Water Mortgage notes that a score of 740 or higher is considered top tier in the context of home loan applications.\n\u2022 Maintain a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. You can calculate your DTI by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income, then multiplying by 100. For example, someone with a $3,000 monthly income and $750 in monthly debt payments has a 25% DTI. When applying for a mortgage, it\u2019s typically best to have a DTI of 36% or below, though you may be approved with a DTI as high as 43%.\n\u2022 Get prequalified with multiple lenders. Consider trying a mix of large banks, local credit unions, and online lenders and compare offers. Additionally, connecting with loan officers at several different institutions can help you evaluate what you\u2019re looking for in a lender and which one will best meet your needs. Just ensure that when you\u2019re comparing rates, you\u2019re doing so in a consistent way\u2014if one estimate involves purchasing mortgage discount points and another doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s important to recognize there\u2019s an upfront cost for buying down your rate with points.\n\u2022 Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for August 28, 2025.\n\u2022 Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for August 28, 2025.\n\u2022 Discover the current price of gold for August 28, 2025.\n\u2022 Discover the current price of silver for August 28, 2025. An important bit of context for the discussion about high mortgage rates is that today\u2019s rates around 7% feel high because of the recent memory of rates between 2% and 3%. Those rates were possible due to unprecedented government action aimed at preventing recession as the country grappled with a global pandemic. However, under more typical economic conditions, experts agree we\u2019re unlikely to see such exceptionally low interest rates again. Historically, rates in the vicinity of 7% are not unusually high. Consider this St. Louis Fed (FRED) chart tracking Freddie Mac data on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage average. From the 1970s through the 1990s, such rates were more or less the norm, with a significant spike in the early 1980s. In fact, September, October, and November of 1981 all saw mortgage interest rates exceeding 18%. Chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showing the history of the average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage in the U.S. Nevertheless, this historical perspective offers little consolation to homeowners who may want to move but are locked in with a once-in-a-lifetime low interest rate. Such situations are common enough in the current market that low pandemic-era rates keeping homeowners from moving when they otherwise would have become known as the \u201cgolden handcuffs.\u201d The U.S. economy may well be the single largest driver of mortgage rates. When lenders fear inflation, they can raise rates to protect their long-term profits. Plus, the national debt is another significant factor. When the government has to borrow large sums to cover what it spends, that can drive interest rates higher. Demand for home loans is key too. If few people are borrowing, lenders might lower rates to attract business. But if loans are in high demand, they might raise rates to cover their costs. In addition, the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions play a role. The Fed can sway rates for mortgages and other financial products by changing the federal funds rate and by managing its balance sheet. The federal funds rate gets a lot of media attention. When it changes, mortgage rates often follow suit. But remember, the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates directly, and they don\u2019t always move in perfect sync with the fed funds rate. Perhaps even more importantly, the Fed influences rates through its balance sheet. In tough times, it can buy assets like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to boost the economy. But recently, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet, choosing not to replace assets as they mature. This tends to push interest rates up. So while everyone focuses on cuts or hikes to the fed funds rate, what the central bank does with its balance sheet might be even more important for your mortgage rate. Comparing rates on different types of loans and shopping around with various lenders are both essential steps in obtaining the best mortgage for your situation. If your credit is excellent, opting for a conventional mortgage might be the ideal choice for you. However, if your score is below 600, an FHA loan may give you an opportunity that a conventional loan would not. When it comes to exploring options with different banks, credit unions, and online lenders, it can make a significant difference in your overall costs. Freddie Mac research indicates that in a market with high interest rates, homebuyers may be able to save $600 to $1,200 annually if they apply with multiple mortgage lenders.

In this environment, U.S. homebuyers are faced with high mortgage rates\u2014though some can still find ways to make their purchase more affordable, such as negotiating rate buydowns with a builder when buying newly constructed housing.\nHow to get the best mortgage rate you can\nWhile economic conditions are out of your control, your financial profile as an applicant also has a major impact on how low a mortgage rate you\u2019re offered.

The minimum credit score to get a conventional mortgage is generally 620 (for FHA loans, you may be able to qualify with a score of 580 or a score as low as 500 and a 10% down payment).

Just make sure when you\u2019re comparing rates that you\u2019re doing it in a way that\u2019s apples to apples\u2014if one estimate relies on you purchasing mortgage discount points and another does not, it\u2019s important to understand there\u2019s an upfront cost for buying down your rate with points.\nMortgage interest rates historical chart\nAn important piece of context to the discussion surrounding high mortgage rates is that rates in the ballpark of 7% feel high because of the recent memory of rates in the range of 2% to 3%. Those rates were possible as the federal government took virtually unprecedented action trying to prevent recession as the country battled a global pandemic.\nHowever, under more typical economic conditions, experts agree we\u2019re unlikely to see such dramatically low interest rates again. And, historically, rates in the vicinity of 7% are not abnormally high.\nConsider this St. Louis Fed (FRED) chart tracking Freddie Mac data on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage average. From the 1970s through the 1990s, such rates were more or less the norm, with a massive spike in the early 1980s. In fact, September, October, and November of 1981 all saw mortgage interest rates above 18%.\nStill, that historical context is scant comfort for homeowners who may want to move but are locked in with a once-in-a-lifetime low interest rate. Such situations are common enough in the current market that low pandemic-era rates keeping homeowners put when they\u2019d otherwise move have become known as the \u201cgolden handcuffs.\u201d\nFactors that impact mortgage interest rates\nThe state of the U.S. economy may well be the biggest thing impacting mortgage rates. If lenders are worried about inflation, they can hike rates to protect their future earnings. And, the national debt is another big factor. When the government has to borrow large sums to cover its spending, that can push interest rates higher.\nDemand for home loans plays a big role too. If not many consumers are seeking loans, lenders might cut rates to attract borrowers. But if demand is high, they might raise rates to cover the costs of handling more loans.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s actions are also crucial. The Fed can influence mortgage rates both by adjusting the federal funds rate and by managing its balance sheet.\nThat first factor, the federal funds rate, gets a lot of coverage in the media. When the Fed hikes or cuts it, mortgage rates often follow. But keep in mind, the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates directly, and they don\u2019t always move in perfect step with the fed funds rate.\nThe Fed also impacts rates on long-term financial products like mortgages via its balance sheet. During economic downturns, the central bank can buy assets like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to inject money into the economy.\nBut recently, the Fed has been trimming its balance sheet, letting assets mature without buying new ones. This tends to push interest rates up. So while everyone watches for federal funds rate decisions, what the Fed does with its balance sheet might matter even more for your mortgage rate.\nWhy it\u2019s important to compare mortgage rates\nComparing rates on different types of loans and shopping around with different lenders are both important steps in getting the best mortgage for your situation.\nIf your credit is in stellar shape, opting for a conventional mortgage could very well be the best choice for you. But, if your score is sub-600, an FHA loan may give you a chance a conventional loan would not.\nWhen it comes to shopping around with different banks, credit unions, and online lenders, it can make a tangible difference in how much you pay. Freddie Mac research shows that in a market with high interest rates, homebuyers may be able to save $600 to $1,200 annually if they apply with multiple mortgage lenders."

      "text": "High-yield savings accounts are still must-have for savvy savers, as they offer annual percentage yields (APYs) that far surpass the average. Right now, a few of the best savings accounts offer rates above 4%, with a handful still approaching the coveted 5.00% mark.\nRecent economic indicators point to hotter inflation and an uncertain U.S. economic outlook. As a result, the Federal Reserve has held off on rate cuts for a while. While this isn\u2019t the best news for some parts of the economy, it suggests that savings account APYs could remain where they are for the moment.\nTo help savers maximize their returns, Fortune has joined forces with the banking industry experts at Curinos to bring you a comprehensive overview of the highest savings account rates currently available nationwide.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for August 29, 2025.\nThe best high-yield savings accounts on August 28, 2025: Earn up to 5.00% APY\nVaro Money currently leads the pack with an impressive 5.00% rate on its high-yield savings account, setting the bar for the industry. Other institutions with very competitive yields include Betterment, SoFi, and Presidential Bank.\nFortune continuously monitors the top rates offered by leading U.S. financial institutions. Check out top savings account rates on August 28, 2025:\nFDIC average national deposit rates: January 2020 to present\nRight now, the national average savings rate hovers at 0.39%, marking a noticeable decrease from the 0.47% rate recorded in March 2024. This downward trend correlated closely with the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate reductions toward the end of 2024.\nSavings account news in 2025\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decisions have a major impact on savings accounts. When the Fed increases its benchmark rate, banks typically respond by raising the interest offered on savings accounts to maintain competitiveness. Conversely, when the Fed lowers rates, savings account yields tend to decrease.\nHowever, this relationship isn\u2019t always so straightforward. While changes frequently follow in the wake of Fed meetings, which are held approximately eight times per year, some banks adjust rates more often depending on their competitive positioning or in response to unexpected market developments.\nIt\u2019s anticipated that savings account rates will remain stable in the coming months. The Fed last cut rates in December 2024, but the outlook on inflation is uncertain these days. The next FOMC meeting will be held on Sept. 16-17, 2025.\nHere\u2019s what you get with a high-yield savings account\nHigh-yield savings accounts typically provide rates that are 10 to 20 times higher than their traditional counterparts. For instance, while the national average savings rate stands at 0.39%, many high-yield accounts offer rates exceeding 4%.\nTraditional accounts often provide physical branch access but with lower rates, while high-yield accounts are typically offered by online banks and feature higher rates but limited in-person services.\nConsider opening a high-yield savings account for these benefits:\n- Significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts\n- Often free from minimum balance requirements or monthly fees\n- Ideal for emergency funds or short-term savings goals\n- FDIC-insured, providing the same protection as traditional banks\nWhen looking for a new savings account, interest rates aren\u2019t the only factor to consider. Make sure you also avoid accounts with monthly maintenance fees, and look into how hard it will be to access your funds. You want to ensure you can easily make withdrawals or transfers when necessary\u2014preferably without any pesky foreign ATM fees.\nFrequently asked questions\nHow often do APYs on high-yield savings accounts change?\nHigh-yield savings account rates don\u2019t change on a predictable timetable. Your bank or credit union may alter the rate at any time, though APY adjustments often coincide with changes in the Fed\u2019s decisions on whether to raise or cut the federal funds rate.\nShould I switch banks if I find a savings account with a higher rate?\nMoving your money for a better rate can make sense, but weigh the effort against the potential benefit. Check if the new account has minimum balance rules and calculate how much more you\u2019d actually earn before deciding.\nHow easy is it to withdraw money from a HYSA?\nWithdrawing money from a HYSA is usually pretty hassle free, thanks to digital banking. Assuming your institution lets you link external accounts online, you can likely initiate a withdrawal with just a few clicks. But make sure you\u2019re aware of monthly withdrawal limits\u2014many banks still cap withdrawals at six per statement cycle even though it\u2019s no longer a federal restriction.\nShould I choose an online-only bank for my HYSA?\nIf maximizing your APY is your priority, online-only banks are a solid choice, as their reduced operating expenses may translate to better rates for savers.\nCan I lose money in a high-yield savings account?\nAs long as your account is with an FDIC- or NCUA-insured institution, your funds are safe from loss up to the insurance limit. Of course, there\u2019s still the possibility that your account\u2019s APY might not keep pace with inflation, which could diminish your savings\u2019 value over time.\nSeries on daily savings rates created by former Fortune editor Cassie Bottorff.

      "text": "As of 9:25 a.m. Eastern Time on August 28, 2025, gold was priced at $3,404 per ounce. This represents a $21 rise from yesterday at the same hour and an increase of $883 compared to one year ago.\n| Gold price per ounce | % Change | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Price of gold yesterday | $3,383 | -0.62% |\n| Price of gold 1 month ago | $3,309 | -2.79% |\n| Price of gold 1 year ago | $2,521 | -25.94% |\n| Price of gold yesterday | |\n|---|---|\n| Gold price per ounce | $3,383 |\n| % Change | -0.62% |\n| Price of gold 1 month ago | |\n| Gold price per ounce | $3,309 |\n| % Change | -2.79% |\n| Price of gold 1 year ago | |\n| Gold price per ounce | $2,521 |\n| % Change | -25.94% |\nIf you\u2019re searching for an investment that doesn\u2019t move in lockstep with inflation, gold could be a smart pick. Over time, gold has generally shown an upward trend in value. Many investors use a gold IRA to buy and hold gold, which can help stabilize a portfolio during market swings. It\u2019s also a convenient option for those who want to avoid the hassle of storing physical gold.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for August 29, 2025.\nHistorical gold price chart\nGold isn\u2019t always the top performer. In times of economic strength, stocks can yield better returns both short and long term. Between 1971 and 2024, the average annual return for stocks was 10.7%, while gold averaged 7.9% annually.\nNevertheless, gold is often favored as a low-risk asset during economic uncertainty. For this reason, some investors treat it more as a store of value than as a traditional investment like stocks or bonds.\nWhat does \u201cspot gold\u201d mean?\nThe spot price of gold is the current price for immediate purchase or sale in the over-the-counter market. This price helps investors track gold demand and market trends in real time. In simple terms, a higher spot price indicates stronger demand for gold. Unlike futures, the spot price refers to immediate delivery.\nWhen the price for future delivery is higher than the spot price, it\u2019s called contango, which is typical for commodities with storage costs. If the futures price is below the spot price, it\u2019s known as backwardation.\nNumerous variables can affect the spot price, making it highly volatile. Investors in gold should be prepared for these price swings.\nWhat is price spread in gold trading?\nThe price spread is the difference between an asset\u2019s buying price and its selling price.\nIn gold markets, the ask price is the cost to purchase, while the bid price is what you\u2019d get for selling. The bid is always lower than the ask.\nA smaller spread means the market is more liquid. When spreads are narrow, it usually points to increased gold demand.\nHow to invest in gold\nIf you imagine gold investing as a cartoonish dive into a pile of coins, that\u2019s only part of the story. While physical gold bars, coins, or jewelry are options, most gold trading happens through exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nJames Taska, a fee-based financial advisor, says, \u201cThere is a great debate as to whether paper gold is as useful as the physical. From a financial advisor\u2019s viewpoint, it is much easier to rebalance a client\u2019s allocation of gold if it is owned as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the spread when attempting to buy/sell gold can be quite variable and wide.\u201d\nSome common gold investment methods include:\n- Gold bars: Also called bullion, these are sold by weight, with details like purity and manufacturer marked on the bar. There are also gold rounds.\n- Gold coins: Collectibles such as the American Gold Eagle coin, often sold at a premium due to their rarity.\n- Gold jewelry: Priced above the gold content for design and craftsmanship.\n- Gold futures contracts: Agreements to buy gold at a set price in the future, letting investors speculate on price movements without handling the metal.\n- Gold funds: Mutual funds or ETFs invested in gold assets, whose value changes with the underlying holdings.\nIs it a good time to invest in gold?\nDeciding if now is the best time to buy gold is subjective. Still, gold can help diversify your portfolio and reduce the impact of market volatility.\nGold remains a stable choice amid market turbulence. Prices have surged to record highs, up over 25% since early 2025, driven by inflation and uncertainty. Many experts see this as a good time to add gold for diversification.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 9:25 a.m. ET on August 28, 2025\n| Precious Metal | Price per ounce |\n|---|---|\n| Gold | $3,404 |\n| Silver | $39 |\n| Platinum | $1,344 |\n| Palladium | $1,101 |\n| Gold | |\n|---|---|\n| Price per ounce | $3,404 |\n| Silver | |\n| Price per ounce | $39 |\n| Platinum | |\n| Price per ounce | $1,344 |\n| Palladium | |\n| Price per ounce | $1,101 |\nSilver, platinum, and palladium are also popular among investors. Gold is usually less volatile than silver, which can see significant price swings even within a day. Silver\u2019s widespread industrial use makes it more sensitive to economic trends.\nPlatinum and palladium share similar traits with silver. While they offer diversification benefits, they tend to be more volatile than gold.\nAugusta Precious Metals\n| A+ BBB rating, AAA BCA rating \u2013 unmatched trust and credibility |\n| Over 1,000 verified 5-star reviews from real customers |\n| Highest buyback guarantee \u2013 You\u2019re in control. Switch easily if we fall short |\nThe takeaway\nThe U.S. economy has been unsettled for some time, with persistent inflation making an impact. Gold can serve as a hedge against inflation in your portfolio. Thanks to various ways to buy, gold is accessible to investors of all experience levels. Whether using a gold IRA or a more active investment approach, gold can help achieve both short- and long-term goals.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the best way to own gold?\nMany investors opt for gold ETFs, which provide a managed basket of easily traded assets.\nIs gold a good investment?\nGold is often chosen by those wanting to diversify and hedge against inflation. There are many straightforward ways to invest in gold.\nShould I buy gold coins or gold bars?\nGold coins are collectibles and may command a higher price per ounce than bars. Their collectible and historical value can make them appealing. U.S. minted coins may also help protect against counterfeit bars."

Average CD yields declined significantly in 2024 as the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates, and while they have stabilized in 2025 as the central bank holds off on making more rate changes, markets expect more Fed rate cuts this year.\nThe highest CD rates available on August 28, 2025 offer up to 4.45% annual percentage yield. By funding a certificate now, you could secure these high rates for years, depending on the choice of a CD term that best suits your goals. With lower interest rates possible later in 2025, there\u2019s no time to lose.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for August 29, 2025.\nThe best CD rates on August 28, 2025: Earn up to 4.45%\nThe highest CD rate on August 28, 2025 of 4.45% is offered by E*TRADE on its six-month CD. While savers can also earn a 4.45% APY from Bread Savings on a six-month CD and from My eBanc on a 12-month jumbo CD, E*TRADE stands out for having no minimum deposit requirement.\nFortune monitors the top rates offered by leading U.S. financial institutions to help our readers obtain the best possible return on their CD investments. Here are the highest CD rates on August 28, 2025:\nCompare CD rates by term length\nCurrently, both short-term and long-term CD yields remain elevated. While high APYs aren\u2019t the sole consideration when choosing the best CD for your money, knowing the highest rates available can help you make a well-informed decision.\nPro tip\nLooking for the best CD to fit your investment needs? See rates from top institutions:\n-Wells Fargo\n-Capital One\n-Chase\n-Bank of America\n-Discover Bank\n-Northern Bank Direct\n-Ally Bank\n-Newtek Bank\n-Popular Direct\n-Citibank\n-Sallie Mae Bank\nCompare CD rates at top national banks\nIf you're unfamiliar with the banks listed in the table above, there\u2019s a good reason. The big banks depend less on certificates of deposit to build their capital base than smaller financial institutions. That means they see less need to compete by offering the highest rates.\nEstablished banks like Chase, PNC, and U.S. Bank acquire customers via business lines like loans and credit cards. As a result, CD interest rates offered by these banks are often lower compared to those available at smaller regional banks or online institutions. Securing a competitive rate at big banks may require opening additional deposit accounts or meeting higher minimum deposit requirements.\nCD rates news 2025\nSeasoned investors know that CD market rates closely track the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve, particularly changes in the fed funds rate. Anyone who wants to invest in CD should learn to keep an eye on central bank policy changes in order to understand shifts in CD yields.\nThe end of January marked the first semi-annual meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2025. The FOMC did not make any changes to the fed funds rate this time around, implying that CD rates will likely hold steady for now. The most recent Fed meeting took place July 29-30 and the fed funds rate once again remained unchanged\u2014the next meeting is set for Sept. 16-17.\nIn 2024, the Fed cut rates three times\u2014the last rate cut was at the December FOMC meeting\u2014leaving rates in a range of 4.25%-4.50%. These changes came in response to cooling U.S. inflation, and the Fed aimed to support the U.S. economy with cheaper lending. This is why CD rates came off their previous two-decade highs last year.\nThose historically high CD yields were driven by aggressive Fed interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the FOMC hiked rates 11 times, from zero up to a range of 5.25%-5.50%. The Fed\u2019s higher rates were an attempt to cool off the hottest inflation readings since the 1980s, which were themselves the result of economic disruptions from the pandemic.\nIt's worth noting that current CD rates aren\u2019t far off their recent peaks. Investors still have the opportunity to secure competitive rates on both short-term and long-term CDs. By depositing a larger lump sum into your CD account, you can generate considerable interest earnings.\nHistorical CD rates\nIn the early 1980s, CD rates soared into the double digits, a sharp contrast to lower yields. By 2019, however, the APY for a five-year CD was only a hair above 3.00%.\nThroughout the early 2020s, rates soared over 5.00% as the economy worked its way through the Covid-19 pandemic. Five years later, we are seeing CD rates stabilize in the 3.00%-4.00% range.\nHow to get a good CD rate\nDetermining what qualifies as a \"good\" CD rate involves striking the right balance between high rates and your appetite for locking up money for a long period of time. Say you\u2019re looking at a 5-year certificate yielding 5.00% APY. You should only pull the trigger if you\u2019re sure you won\u2019t need the funds sooner and you don\u2019t think interest will increase.\nKey factors to evaluate when comparing CDs include:\n- Term length: Ensure it aligns with your savings objectives and time frame.\n- APY: Typically, higher rates are offered for longer terms.\n- Minimum deposit: Confirm that you can meet the required initial balance.\n- Penalties: Understand the costs associated with early withdrawal before maturity.\n- Deposit insurance: Verify that the bank is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)- or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)insured to keep your money secure.\nOnline banks typically advertise the highest CD yields, just make sure you understand the minimum balance requirements and any associated fees. Opting for a bank rather than a broker can sometimes help avoid unnecessary charges.\nLook into offerings from online banks\nFintech firms and online banks generally offer more competitive rates than national banks. Large financial institutions generate revenue from interest on loans, fees, and investments in securities.\nIn contrast, smaller banks and online fintech companies attract customers with competitive APYs on deposit accounts. Additionally, online banks have lower overhead costs, which lets them pay better rates on deposits.\nSet up a CD ladder\nCD ladders are ideal for savers who prefer not to tie up funds for long periods. By spreading savings across CDs with varying maturity dates, you can enjoy both short-term access and higher long-term interest rates.\nFor example, start by investing $3,000 in three staggered CDs (1-year, 2-year, and 3-year). As each CD reaches maturity, reinvest the funds into a new 3-year CD. This strategy provides yearly access to your money along with the accumulated interest.\nUnderstand the different kinds of CDs\nThere are several types of CDs available to cater to different financial needs:\n- Brokered CDs are purchased and sold through brokerage accounts rather than directly from banks or credit unions. They often provide higher APYs since they are issued by banks and then sold to brokerages.\n- Callable CDs include a feature that allows the issuing institution to terminate the CD before its maturity date. Investors receive their principal and any accrued interest up to the call date if this option is exercised.\n- Bump-up CDs allow you to request a higher APY if interest rates increase after opening the account. Typically, you can adjust the rate once or twice during the CD's term.\n- No-penalty CDs do not charge penalties for early withdrawals before maturity. This type is less common and may offer lower APYs compared to traditional CDs.\n- Jumbo CDs require a substantial minimum deposit, often starting at $100,000 or more. They generally offer higher APYs than standard CDs.\n- Variable-rate CDs have an APY that changes in response to prevailing interest rates. These CDs carry more risk than traditional CDs because a decrease in interest rates before maturity can result in a lower yield.\nSeries on daily CD rates created by former Fortune editor Cassie Bottorff.

      "text": "The current average refinance rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate home loan is 6.58%, according to data from the popular real estate marketplace Zillow. If you\u2019re a homeowner hoping to refinance your mortgage for a lower rate or perhaps to tap home equity, read on to see average refi interest rates for a variety of loan types and terms. You can also see the prior day\u2019s report here.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for August 29, 2025.\nCurrent refi rates data\nNote that Fortune reviewed the most recent Zillow data available as of Aug. 27.\nHow mortgage refinancing works\nBoiled down to the basics, mortgage refinancing involves paying off your existing loan with a new one. This process requires meeting the lender\u2019s criteria as is the case for any loan\u2014including your credit profile, income verification, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.\nThe application process may knock your credit score a little bit due to a hard inquiry, and there\u2019s also the risk of denial if you don\u2019t meet the lender\u2019s requirements.\nWhat\u2019s happening with mortgage rates in the market?\nSome observers had hoped that mortgage interest rates might decrease following the Federal Reserve\u2019s cuts to the federal funds rate late last year. But mortgage rates have remained near 7% for 30-year, fixed-rate loans nationwide.\nThere was a slight dip toward the end of February where the average rate fell closer to 6.5%. However, mortgage interest rates remain significantly elevated compared to the pandemic-era lows in the range of 2% and 3%. As of the third quarter of 2024, 82.8% of homeowners with mortgages had rates below 6%, according to Redfin. This means a large number of Americans are experiencing the lock-in effect, unable to move or refinance because they\u2019re hanging onto a once-in-a-lifetime rate.\nWhen it might make sense to refinance your mortgage\nRefinancing comes with upfront costs, so it\u2019s important to consider when it\u2019s beneficial. One guideline you\u2019ll often hear is that it makes sense to refi if you can secure a rate at least a percentage point lower than your current rate. For instance, if you took out a loan at 7% and rates have since declined, refinancing at 6% would probably be a smart call in terms of long-term savings.\nYou might also refinance to tap into your home equity via a cash-out refinance (which typically requires that you have at least 20% equity built up).\nRefinancing can also help if you want to change your loan term or switch loan types, such as moving from an FHA loan to a conventional loan to get rid of the FHA loan\u2019s lifetime mortgage insurance (MIP) requirement, or from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage to avoid the potential for rate hikes.\nAdditionally, refinancing can be beneficial if you want to adjust your loan term. For example, switching from a 15-year to a 30-year mortgage can allow for smaller monthly payments, which might be more manageable if your financial situation has changed.\nCosts to refinance your mortgage\nRefinancing involves closing costs, typically ranging from 2% to 6% of the loan amount. For a $300,000 loan, costs might range from $6,000 to $18,000. Some common costs include:\n- Lender origination fees.\n- Appraisal fees.\n- Title search and insurance fees.\n- Loan application fees.\n- Survey fees.\n- Attorney fees (if required in your state).\n- Recording fees.\n- Prepayment penalties (if applicable in the terms of your current loan).\nDifferent types of mortgage refi loans\nThere are many types of mortgage refinance loans available, and the right one for you will depend on what you\u2019re trying to do and what type of mortgage you currently have. Here are some common refi types:\n- Rate-and-term refinance: This is probably the most popular refi, offering the chance to secure a lower interest rate or change your loan term. Just know that if you choose to shorten your loan term, while that does typically come with a lower rate and meaningful lifetime interest savings, you\u2019ll have to budget for higher monthly mortgage payments.\n- Cash-out refinance: With a cash-out refi, you can tap your home\u2019s equity by paying off your existing loan balance and accepting a new, larger one. You withdraw the difference in cash. That money can then be used for home improvements, consolidating high-interest debt, or virtually any other financial goal you may have.\n- No-closing-cost refinance: Approach this one with a healthy level of skepticism. With this type of refi, your lender covers the closing costs in exchange for charging a higher interest rate. If you don\u2019t have cash on hand for closing costs and could otherwise benefit from a refinance, this option may be worth a look.\n- Streamline refinance: Available to existing FHA, VA and USDA loan borrowers, a streamline refi will typically involve less documentation and offer a more straightforward application and approval process.\nRefinancing with your existing lender vs. a new one\nYou\u2019re not required to refinance with your original lender. Shopping around might potentially help you find better rates and service.\nThat said, some lenders offer incentives, such as waiving closing costs, for staying with them. So you should at least do the due diligence of checking with your existing lender before making a decision.\nAlso, know that if your mortgage has been purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you might be eligible for programs like Refi Now and Refi Possible."

In the long term, it significantly trails the stock market. Since 1921, silver\u2019s value has lagged the S&P 500 by about 96%\u2014meaning an identical investment in both would leave the silver portion worth roughly 96% less on August 28, 2025.\nSilver\u2019s appeal lies in stability and hedging against inflation. Known as a \u201cstore of value,\u201d it often preserves purchasing power when inflation bites, effectively petrifying the value of your money until you want to access it again.\nThat said, silver\u2019s price swings are more pronounced than gold\u2019s because of its industrial applications\u2014in gadgets, healthcare tools, and beyond\u2014whereas gold is almost exclusively a safe-haven asset.\nWhat does \u201cspot silver\u201d mean?\nThe \u201cspot silver\u201d price indicates the current rate at which silver could, in principle, be traded instantly. But we should note that buyers in the real world typically face premiums above spot to cover markups, shipping costs, and insurance.\nSpot pricing offers investors a real-time barometer of market demand. That is to say, a higher spot price suggests stronger buying pressure.\nWhat is \u201cprice spread\u201d in silver trading?\n\u201cPrice spread\u201d denotes the difference between ask and bid prices:\n- Ask price. This means the cost to purchase silver\n- Bid price. This means the proceeds from selling silver\nA tight bid-ask spread points to high liquidity, while a wide gap can indicate lower trading activity.\nHow to invest in silver\nSilver holdings can be physical or fund-based (ETFs).\nETFs allow you to gain exposure without handling storage or logistics, as the fund can still retain actual silver.\nPopular silver investments include:\n- Bullion. This is in the form of bars or rounds sold by weight and purity.\n- Coins. Government-minted currency such as American Silver Eagles and Silver Maple Leafs, often sold at a premium, are popular both for aesthetic reasons and because the government backing may give buyers a level of confidence in the purchase\u2019s authenticity.\n- Jewelry. Think artisanal pieces that command prices above equivalent-purity bullion.\n- Mining stocks. This refers to shares in companies extracting silver, offering an indirect route for investing in silver.\nOn exchange platforms, bullion and coins must be at least 99.9% pure. Anything below this threshold typically qualifies as industrial or collectible silver.\nIs it a good time to invest in silver?\nSilver\u2019s price has climbed almost 25% in 2025, reaching decade-high levels.\nWhether to buy now hinges on your strategy. Precious metals can hedge inflation, and rising industrial uses\u2014from solar to electronics\u2014could potentially drive further gains. However, investors looking for more robust growth may be disappointed.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 8:20 a.m. ET on August 28, 2025\n| Precious metal | Price per ounce |\n|---|---|\n| Gold | $3,406.48 |\n| Silver | $39.01 |\n| Platinum | $1,346.40 |\n| Palladium | $1,104.96 |\n| Gold | |\n|---|---|\n| Price per ounce | $3,406.48 |\n| Silver | |\n| Price per ounce | $39.01 |\n| Platinum | |\n| Price per ounce | $1,346.40 |\n| Palladium | |\n| Price per ounce | $1,104.96 |\nGold is the stalwart safe haven; platinum and palladium share similar volatility to silver due to smaller markets.\nThe takeaway\nIn an uncertain economy, precious metals may be a prudent addition to one\u2019s portfolio. Silver\u2019s performance in 2025 has bested gold\u2019s, and some analysts predict a continued uptrend which may potentially push prices to all-time highs.\nSilver\u2019s relatively low cost makes it more accessible for the casual investor. Whether through physical holdings, ETFs, or mining equities, you can position yourself to benefit from the next silver upswing.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat percentage of my portfolio should I allocate to silver?\nAdvisors typically advise allocating no more than 10% to 15% to silver and capping precious-metal exposure overall at 20%.\nCan silver be held in an IRA?\nYes\u2014IRA-approved, 99.9% pure coins and bars held by an IRS-approved custodian qualify.\nWhile some may choose to collect silver jewelry with lower purity levels or pre-1965 U.S. coins containing silver (often containing around 90% purity and known as \u201cjunk silver\u201d) just know these won\u2019t qualify for IRA inclusion.\nWhat\u2019s driving silver prices in 2025?\nThis year\u2019s silver rally likely stems from limited supply and growing demand from industrial and investment sectors."

      "text": "The current average rate on 5-year adjustable-rate mortgages is 6.75%, according to data from the popular real estate marketplace Zillow. If you\u2019re considering an ARM to buy a home, whether to call your own or as an investment property, read on\u2014we\u2019ll take a look at average rates for a couple ARM types, show you how ARMs work, and explain when such a loan might be worth considering even though fixed-rate mortgages are by far the more popular option.\nYou can see the previous business day\u2019s ARM rates report here.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for August 29, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for August 29, 2025.\nAverage ARM mortgage rates\nNote that Fortune reviewed the most recent Zillow data available as of Aug. 27.\nFixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\nFixed-rate mortgages dominate U.S. households, comprising about 92% of all home loans. Unlike adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which allow interest rates to change after an initial period, fixed-rate loans offer consistency throughout their term\u2014which likely explains their popularity.\nThat said, ARMs can be advantageous under specific circumstances. Around 8% of borrowers choose them for their unique benefits.\nWhen you might consider an adjustable-rate mortgage\nThree groups of homebuyers can commonly benefit from considering ARMs:\n- Homeowners who intend to move soon: If you\u2019re confident you\u2019ll be moving in a few years, perhaps because this is a starter home, an ARM may let you enjoy a low introductory rate without worrying about future adjustments.\n- Real estate investors: Landlords buying a property to rent out or house flippers intending to sell a property quickly may use ARMs with the intent of adjusting the monthly rent if interest rates increase or selling before the adjustment period kicks in.\n- Buyers in high-interest environments: During times of elevated interest rates, ARMs can sometimes offer lower rates during the introductory period, and the potential for relief later if market conditions improve.\nHow adjustable-rate mortgages work\nARMs begin with an introductory fixed rate that often lasts three, five, seven, or 10 years before the loan transitions into its adjustment periods. How much your rate changes during an adjustment period can depend on a variety of factors, including:\n- Benchmarks like SOFR: An ARM\u2019s rate is typically tied to a benchmark, commonly SOFR. This particular benchmark reflects the cost for banks to borrow money overnight. The U.S. Treasury publishes an updated each morning.\n- Margins: Fixed margins are added by lenders on top of the benchmark to determine your ARM rate. These can often range between 2% to 3.5%.\n- Caps: Adjustment caps limit how much rates can increase at specific intervals or over time. You may hear about initial adjustment caps, subsequent caps, and lifetime caps.\nCommon ARM formats include 5/1 (an introductory rate that lasts for five years followed by annual adjustments) and 10/6 (a 10-year intro period followed by adjustments every six months) structures. Other structures on the market include 3/1 ARMs, 7/1 ARMs and 10/1 ARMs.\nLearn more: Why the Secured Overnight Financing Rate might matter for your mortgage.\nRefinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage\nLife happens. Plans change. If it turns out you\u2019re going to be in your starter home longer than expected, and you initially took out an ARM, you might opt to refinance to a fixed-rate loan.\nFirst, know you\u2019re not alone. A large chunk of Millennial and Gen Z homeowners can\u2019t afford to upgrade and are continuing on in their starter homes\nTo refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage, the process is more or less the same as refinancing from one fixed-rate loan to another. You\u2019ll shop around with various lenders, provide the application documents necessary to show your credit profile and income meet the lender\u2019s requirements, and you\u2019ll use the new loan to pay your old one off in full.\nPros and cons of adjustable-rate mortgages\nWork with a trusted loan officer to ensure you\u2019re selecting the best mortgage type for your needs. To get you started, here are some basic factors to consider in evaluating if an ARM is right for you.\nPros\n- Possibly lower initial rate compared with fixed-rate loans.\n- Potentially easier qualification standards for some borrowers.\n- Chance to save if market conditions improve and rates go down.\nCons\n- Payments could spike after adjustments begin.\n- Comparing offers is more complex than with common fixed-rate loans.\n- Homeowners face more unpredictability than with a fixed-rate loan."

      "text": "The average interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgage loan in the U.S. is 6.548%, according to data available from mortgage data company Optimal Blue. That\u2019s up approximately 2 basis points from the prior day\u2019s report, and down approximately 8 basis points from a week ago. Read on to compare average rates for a variety of conventional and government-backed mortgage types and see whether rates have increased or decreased.\nCurrent mortgage rates data:\nNote that Fortune reviewed Optimal Blue\u2019s latest available data on Aug. 28, with the numbers reflecting home loans locked in as of Aug. 27.\nWhat\u2019s happening with mortgage rates in today\u2019s market?\nIf it feels as though 30-year mortgage rates have been stuck on the verge of 7% for an extended period, that\u2019s not too far off. Many observers anticipated that rates would soften when the Federal Reserve started reducing the federal funds rate last September, but there was no sustained decrease in mortgage rates. There was a short-lived dip preceding the September Fed meeting, but rates rapidly climbed afterward.\nBy January 2025 the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage surpassed 7% for the first time since last May, as indicated by Freddie Mac data. That\u2019s a big jump from the historic average low of 2.65% recorded in January 2021, when the government was still working to stimulate the economy and ward off a pandemic-induced economic downturn.\nAbsent another major crisis, experts agree we won\u2019t have mortgage rates in the 2% to 3% range in our lifetimes. Nevertheless, rates around the 6% mark are entirely possible if the U.S. manages to tame inflation and lenders feel optimistic about the economic prospects.\nIn fact, rates had a modest decline at the end of February, dropping nearer to the 6.5% mark than had been seen for some time. There was even a brief point in early April where rates dipped below 6.5%, but they rose immediately afterward.\nAt present, with uncertainty as to the extent to which President Donald Trump will pursue policies such as tariffs and deportations, some observers worry the labor market could constrict and inflation could resurface. Against this backdrop, U.S. homebuyers face high mortgage rates\u2014although some can still find options for making their purchase more manageable, like negotiating rate buydowns with a builder when purchasing newly constructed property.\nHow to get the best mortgage rate you can\nWhile economic conditions are beyond your control, your financial profile as an applicant also has a substantial impact on the mortgage rate you\u2019re offered. With that in mind, aim to do the following:\n- Make sure you have excellent credit. The minimum credit score for a conventional mortgage is generally 620 (for FHA loans, you may qualify with a score of 580 or a score as low as 500 with a 10% down payment). However, if you\u2019re hoping to get a low rate that could potentially save you five or even six figures in interest over the life of your loan, you\u2019ll want a score considerably higher. For instance, lender Blue Water Mortgage notes that a score of 740 or higher is considered top tier in the context of home loan applications.\n- Maintain a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. You can calculate your DTI by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income, then multiplying by 100. For example, someone with a $3,000 monthly income and $750 in monthly debt payments has a 25% DTI. When applying for a mortgage, it\u2019s typically best to have a DTI of 36% or below, though you may be approved with a DTI as high as 43%.\n- Get prequalified with multiple lenders. Consider trying a mix of large banks, local credit unions, and online lenders and compare offers.

Those rates were possible due to unprecedented government action aimed at preventing recession as the country grappled with a global pandemic.\nHowever, under more typical economic conditions, experts agree we\u2019re unlikely to see such exceptionally low interest rates again. Historically, rates in the vicinity of 7% are not unusually high.\nConsider this St. Louis Fed (FRED) chart tracking Freddie Mac data on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage average. From the 1970s through the 1990s, such rates were more or less the norm, with a significant spike in the early 1980s. In fact, September, October, and November of 1981 all saw mortgage interest rates exceeding 18%.\nNevertheless, this historical perspective offers little consolation to homeowners who may want to move but are locked in with a once-in-a-lifetime low interest rate. Such situations are common enough in the current market that low pandemic-era rates keeping homeowners from moving when they otherwise would have become known as the \u201cgolden handcuffs.\u201d\nFactors that impact mortgage interest rates\nThe U.S. economy may well be the single largest driver of mortgage rates. When lenders fear inflation, they can raise rates to protect their long-term profits.\nPlus, the national debt is another significant factor. When the government has to borrow large sums to cover what it spends, that can drive interest rates higher.\nDemand for home loans is key too. If few people are borrowing, lenders might lower rates to attract business. But if loans are in high demand, they might raise rates to cover their costs.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions play a role. The Fed can sway rates for mortgages and other financial products by changing the federal funds rate and by managing its balance sheet.\nThe federal funds rate gets a lot of media attention. When it changes, mortgage rates often follow suit. But remember, the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates directly, and they don\u2019t always move in perfect sync with the fed funds rate.\nPerhaps even more importantly, the Fed influences rates through its balance sheet. In tough times, it can buy assets like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to boost the economy.\nBut recently, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet, choosing not to replace assets as they mature. This tends to push interest rates up. So while everyone focuses on cuts or hikes to the fed funds rate, what the central bank does with its balance sheet might be even more important for your mortgage rate.\nWhy it\u2019s important to compare mortgage rates\nComparing rates on different types of loans and shopping around with various lenders are both essential steps in obtaining the best mortgage for your situation.\nIf your credit is excellent, opting for a conventional mortgage might be the ideal choice for you. However, if your score is below 600, an FHA loan may give you an opportunity that a conventional loan would not.\nWhen it comes to exploring options with different banks, credit unions, and online lenders, it can make a significant difference in your overall costs. Freddie Mac research indicates that in a market with high interest rates, homebuyers may be able to save $600 to $1,200 annually if they apply with multiple mortgage lenders."

  "argos_summary": "The average 30\u2011year fixed\u2011rate mortgage in the U.S. is 6.548% as of Aug.\u202f27\u202f2025, up 2\u202fbp from the prior day and down 8\u202fbp from a week earlier, and has hovered near 7% since the Fed began cutting rates in September\u202f2024.  Fed policy, inflation expectations, national debt, and loan demand are the main drivers keeping rates elevated, while the Fed\u2019s balance\u2011sheet contraction is also contributing to upward pressure.  Homebuyers can still negotiate buydowns or shop multiple lenders to mitigate costs, but refinancing is only worthwhile if a rate drop of at least 1\u202f% can be secured.",
