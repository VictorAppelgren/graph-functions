  "description": "Yara Souza of Orlando, Florida, discovered the ninth-century golden artifact during an excavation in Redesdale, Northumberland, in July.",
  "content": "A student from the Sunshine State recently struck gold during an archaeological excavation in Britain \u2013 over 4,000 miles from home.\n\nYara Souza of Orlando, Florida, discovered the ninth-century golden artifact during an excavation in Redesdale, Northumberland, in July.\n\nAn archaeology student at Newcastle University, Souza said that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe\u201d she found the artifact \u2013 during her first excavation too.\n\n\u201cIt was actually quite overwhelming. It was amazing to discover something that hasn\u2019t been seen for more than 1,000 years,\u201d she said in a university release.\n\n\u201cI was really geeking out over it!\u201d\n\nShe found the artifact near Dere Street, a Roman road that once connected York to Edinburgh and later became part of the modern A68.\n\nAfter missing Newcastle University\u2019s excavation at Birdoswald Roman fort due to illness, Souza said she unearthed the artifact within 90 minutes of digging.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d found something so quickly into my first excavation,\u201d she added.\n\nThe early medieval artifact dates back to the 800s, the school said. It features a decorative finial at one end.\n\nGold was only used by elite individuals at the time, so experts believe the relic could have had a religious or ceremonial use. Further analysis is ongoing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted for Yara that she has made this discovery at the beginning of her career as an archaeologist,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know that Dere Street continued to be a major thoroughfare long after the Romans, and it\u2019s clear from this discovery that high-status people were using it.\u201d\n\nThe discovery follows other recent archaeological finds in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn late May, two different 2,000-year-old shoes were unearthed by volunteers at Magna Roman fort in Northumberland.\n\nThis summer, officials announced that a cache of coins \u2013 equivalent to an Ancient Roman soldier\u2019s monthly paycheck \u2013 was spotted in the English countryside.",

      "text": "Former National Security Advisor John Bolton posted an X message regarding the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine while taking a shot at President Donald Trump's peace efforts Friday morning as FBI agents raided his Maryland home.\n\"Russia has not changed its goal: drag Ukraine into a new Russian Empire,\" Bolton posted to his X account at 7:32 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.\n\"Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede territory it already holds and the remainder of Donetsk, which it has been unable to conquer,\" he continued, linking to an NPR interview he joined earlier in August. \"Zelensky will never do so. Meanwhile, meetings will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don't see these talks making any progress,\"\nThe X post was sent out as news broke that the former ambassador and national security advisor's home in Bethesda, Maryland, was raided by FBI agents who were spotted removing boxes from the property. The agents first responded to the home at 7 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, according to the New York Post's exclusive report on the raid.\nBolton was not arrested or in custody amid the early morning raids.\nThe searches are focused on potential classified documents agents believe Bolton may still possess, one source told Fox News.\nFBI Director Kash Patel, without specifically naming Bolton or the raid, posted to X at 7:03 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time Friday: \"NO ONE is above the law\u2026@FBI agents on mission.\"\n\"Public corruption will not be tolerated,\" FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino shared in his own post Friday morning.\nJOHN BRENNAN EMERGED AS PROMINENT ANTI-TRUMP MEDIA FIGURE LONG BEFORE LATEST DOJ PROBE INTO RUSSIAGATE ORIGINS\nBolton served as Trump's national security advisor between 2018 and 2019, before Trump ousted him because they \"disagreed strongly\" on policy issues.\n\"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\" Trump tweeted in 2019. \"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.\"\nIn the years between Bolton's ousting and Trump's second presidency, Trump repeatedly has slammed his former national security advisor, including claiming he would have sparked \"World War Six,\" and calling him \"one of the dumbest people in Government\" back in 2023.\nFORMER CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN 'CLUELESS' ABOUT WHY FBI WOULD INVESTIGATE HIM\nBolton has taken shots of his own at Trump, including claiming in a 2020 interview that Trump lacks \"the competency to carry out the job.\"\n\"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit for office,\" Bolton said in 2020. \"I don\u2019t think he has the competency to carry out the job. There isn\u2019t really any guiding principle that I was able to discern, other than what\u2019s good for Donald Trump\u2019s re-election.\"\nUpon Trump's return to the Oval Office in January, the administration revoked Bolton's security clearance.\nAfter news broke of the raid on Bolton's home, FBI officials were also spotted at the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations' office in Washington, D.C., removing boxes from the office. Bolton served as ambassador to the U.N. during former President George W. Bush's administration.\nFox News Digital has reached out to Bolton and his office for comment.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News' Breanne Deppish, David Spunt, Michael Dorgan and Emma Woodhead contributed to this report."

The Los Angeles Rams were the first organization to have male cheerleaders in 2018. The Baltimore Ravens also featured several men on their cheerleading squad.\nMeanwhile, the Carolina Panthers had the first transgender cheerleader on its squad until this year.\nANTHONY RICHARDSON'S AGENT NEEDLES COLTS OVER QB1 DECISION, QUESTIONS 'TRUST'\nHowever, the Vikings' situation has become a source of national debate amid Sheik and Conn's recent social media posts.\nFormer Vikings player Jack Brewer and Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., spoke out against the organization for having male cheerleaders.\nBrewer, a former Vikings captain, told Fox News Digital he believes the inclusion of men on the cheerleading squad is an attempt to \"manipulate children.\"\n\"This is purely an attempt to manipulate young children, to overtake the minds of young children with this spiritual evilness,\" Brewer said. \"The influence on kids is manipulating the mind of the children. They are teaching young boys that it\u2019s okay to have pom-poms and cheer and act like women.\"\nTuberville told OutKick\u2019s \"Hot Mic\" on Tuesday that he believes fans could stop buying tickets over the issue.\n\"People will actually quit buying tickets because this is the narrative they\u2019re trying to push. This is not just about a couple of people being men cheerleaders,\" Tuberville said. \"It is about pushing a narrative that you want to put gender into sports and let everyone know we\u2019re trying to show, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to take the masculinity out of it a little bit.\u2019\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe team has stood by the two men, affirming the team is \"proud\" to have them on the sidelines for this upcoming season.\n\"Male cheerleaders have been part of previous Vikings teams and have long been associated with collegiate and professional cheerleading,\" the Vikings told NBC News. \"We support all our cheerleaders and are proud of the role they play as ambassadors of the organization.\"\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof.

      "text": "Alan Hamel was mourning the loss of his wife, Suzanne Somers, when he crossed paths with a familiar face.\nThe former television host recently confirmed his new romance with \"Blade Runner\" actress Joanna Cassidy, who was a guest on his show decades ago. Cassidy, 80, also starred with Somers in the 1985 miniseries \"Hollywood Wives.\" According to Hamel, 89, the pair ran into each other months ago.\n\"There was that connection,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"And we\u2019ve spent a lot of time being with each other, which is great. And I\u2019m almost 10 years older than her, so I\u2019m Joanna\u2019s older man. She\u2019s always wanted an older man. And I came along\u2026 We have both been very active in the entertainment business most of our lives, so neither one of us has anything to prove. We\u2019ve both relaxed into what I refer to as the cocktail hour of our lives.\"\nSUZANNE SOMERS' WIDOWER FINDS ROMANCE WITH LATE WIFE'S 'HOLLYWOOD WIVES' COSTAR\nSomers, who famously starred as Chrissy Snow in the sitcom \"Three\u2019s Company,\" died in 2023 at age 76. The actress battled breast cancer for over 23 years. She and Hamel were married from 1977 until her death.\nHamel admitted that \"it was odd\" stepping into the dating scene after enjoying a happy marriage for so long.\n\"Suzanne and I used to go out on dates once a week, sometimes twice,\" he shared. \"We\u2019d get dressed up, go to a nice restaurant, order a nice bottle of wine, and sit there, enjoying the evening and each other. That went for 55 years, even before we were officially married. So, I was used to dating. I love dating. So, when I felt ready to date again, I did not want some gossip [magazine] saying, \u2018Alan is now dating.\u2019\"\nWATCH: SUZANNE SOMERS REFLECTS ON BUSINESS SUCCESS IN LAST IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW\n\"So, what I did was invite a lot of female friends,\" he shared. \"I\u2019m not romantically involved with any of them, but I would invite two of them who know each other really well to go on a date with me. The three of us went on a date. If someone looked at the three of us, obviously, they knew it wasn\u2019t a romantic date. But those were the first dates I took on. And it felt good. I remembered how much fun dating was.\"\nAs Hamel quietly grieved, he was encouraged to meet up with Cassidy. The connection was instant.\n\"It was quite natural,\" Cassidy told Fox News Digital about their first date. \"I found myself falling into a place that felt very comfortable. I felt very much at ease... I think our first date lasted three days.\"\n\"I also believe that, energetically, you can draw the right people to you,\" she shared. \"I mostly don\u2019t call Alan \u2018Alan.\u2019 I call him \u2018Ah.\u2019 It also happens to be his initials. It just seems like the right name for our mystical get-togetherness. And look, I was quite prepared to move along. I\u2019ve lived alone for a long time. I\u2019ve met people, but no one really floated my boat like Alan did. I just met him, and I went, \u2018Wow, this is a solid connection. This is great.\u2019\"\nHamel is also fulfilling a promise he made to his late wife during the last days of her life.\n\"When we knew the end was near, she said to me, \u2018Once I\u2019m gone, I don\u2019t want you to mope around,\u2019\" Hamel recalled. \"\u2019I want you to live your life.\u2019 I told her OK. But then she looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m serious. I don\u2019t want you to mope around.\u2019 Again, I said OK.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\"When Suzanne passed, I was suddenly living alone,\" he said. \"But I have this incredible family. There\u2019s not one dud among them \u2013 three kids and six grandkids. I see some of them weekly\u2026 And after Suzanne passed, they made sure I was never alone for the first two and a half months. We would sit around, tell stories about Suzanne, have all the big laughs, look back at photographs and hundreds of hours of tapes. It\u2019s been wonderful\u2026 And along came Joanna. She has been my only date since she arrived on the scene, which I\u2019m grateful for.\"\n\"If a relationship is long and happy, and suddenly your partner disappears, I think there can still be hope,\" he reflected.\nHamel noted the modern approach to dating has never felt right to him.\n\"I\u2019ve never been on a dating site,\" he said. \"What I keep hearing is that they\u2019re dangerous. People put pictures of themselves that were taken 40 years ago. It\u2019s hard to believe anything anybody says on a dating site. Now I\u2019m sure there are legit sites, but I have no interest in them at all.\"\nAnd Cassidy is different, he chuckled.\n\"Joanna is very active in things that I would never attempt to do, like air bungee. She also takes these classes where she\u2019s inside a silk envelope upside down, suspended in the air doing yoga. Who thinks this stuff up? Meanwhile, I\u2019m into relaxing. I\u2019m an expert at sitting still. I love putting my brain in neutral and just staring. When people say, \u2018What are you thinking about?\u2019 The answer is nothing. But Joanna\u2019s brain is the antithesis of mine. It\u2019s going 24/7. The expression, \u2018ants in your pants,' applies to her. She\u2019s constantly in motion. She never stops. I\u2019m just sitting.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\"I have a landscaping business,\" Cassidy boasted. \"I\u2019m a photographer, designer, gardener, animal rescuer, and I still work in show business. I have a movie coming out in October, \"Killing Faith\" with Bill Pullman. And I just finished a film with Beverly D\u2019Angelo\u2026 It\u2019s very hard for me to sit still. I have to constantly keep busy, constantly be in motion. And there are lots of things that I love to do, things that bring my life joy every day. I think that\u2019s very important to have. And Alan knows that.\"\nHamel also keeps busy making sure Somers\u2019 legacy is kept alive. He and his family are hands-on in running SuzanneSomers.com, where fans can purchase her beauty and wellness products. They're active on her social media accounts and share her words of wisdom when it comes to health. They are also in the process of launching a \"Suzanne AI\" where fans can \"interact with her one-on-one.\"\nHamel and Cassidy are happily enjoying their blossoming romance. They remained coy when asked if love was in the air.\n\"I love love,\" said Hamel. \"I cherish love \u2013 all kinds of love. I have friends I love. There are so many different kinds of love. But in terms of romantic love, I don\u2019t think there could be anything greater than when two people suddenly find that they\u2019re attracted to one another in many different ways. There\u2019s an uncovering of layers.\"\n\"I think that love is when you\u2019re willing to really put yourself aside and make that other person your focus,\" chimed Cassidy. \"I think it has to do with the ego going away and dissolving. It\u2019s about really being able to listen to someone else. I find that you go into a state of awe. I\u2019ll go, \u2018Wow, I am really present with this person.\u2019 And you won\u2019t hear me say the word \u2018love\u2019 a lot. I am very quiet about that. It\u2019s because it means so much to me. It has to be really true.\"\nAnd it\u2019s never too late to embark on a new romantic journey, she insisted.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Don\u2019t give up,\" she said. \"There are billions of people on the planet. It\u2019s difficult to trust people. But I think if you stay in a very hopeful place and have positive thoughts, life can open up to you in unexpected ways.\""

      "text": "Ancient Roman shoes discovered after being buried for 2,000 years\nVolunteers were baffled recently when they unearthed not one but two ancient shoes at a historic British site.\nThe discoveries were made at Magna, an Ancient Roman fort in Northumberland, in late May. The Roman Army Museum, located near the fort in Brampton, made the announcement.\nPhotographs show volunteers holding the remarkably preserved leather shoes, which have maintained their form despite being buried for 2,000 years.\nA volunteer named Jo found the first shoe, which \u201cseems to have all of its sole layers intact,\u201d the organization said.\nThe shoe\u2019s heel area is still attached to it; its outer sole still contains hobnails. Officials said the find sheds light on how these shoes were crafted.\n\u201cThis gives us a really good look at how Roman shoes were made: Multiple layers of leather were used to form the sole, held together with thongs [leather strips], stitching and hobnails,\u201d the Roman Army Museum said.\n\u201cThese also reinforced the outer surface for walking and are found on many styles of shoe.\u201d\nOfficials were unable to determine the size of the shoe, as a toe area was missing, but they said it \u201cwould have been a large shoe when complete.\u201d\nThe volunteer beamed about the find, telling officials that it \u201creally puts you in touch\u201d with the Romans who lived at the fort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always exciting to find anything that hasn\u2019t been touched for 2,000 years, but a shoe is such a personal item,\u201d said Jo, the volunteer.\nBefore long, another piece of footwear was found.\nThe second shoe was roughly equal to a U.S. men\u2019s size 14, which impressed the volunteers.\nThe find \u201cimmediately drew impressed gasps\u201d from volunteers and staff archaeologists, according to the museum.\n\u201cAlthough in this case [it was] only one of the several sole layers, the sheer size of the shoe and guesses about who could have worn it dominated the conversation,\u201d the organization said.\n\u201cMeasuring in at 32cm long, the equivalent of U.K. men\u2019s size 12-14 in modern footwear, could this one be the largest in the Vindolanda Trust collection? We certainly look forward to finding out!\u201d\nVolunteers also recently dug up pottery fragments, tent pegs and other rarities, but the shoes stole the show.\nMagna is situated near Hadrian\u2019s Wall, a Roman wall designed to protect the northern border of the Britannia from the Picts.\nThe fort was established around 80 A.D., predating Hadrian\u2019s Wall by a few decades.\nLast month, a nearby fort made international headlines when a couple found an ancient depiction of a Roman goddess during another volunteer dig.\nFox News Digital reached out to Vindolanda Trust for additional information."

      "text": "Ancient Roman soldier\u2019s monthly paycheck unearthed in pristine condition\nWhat may have been a Roman soldier\u2019s monthly paycheck has emerged from under the ground, officials announced this month.\nBritish officials recently unveiled the discovery of a 1,900-year-old Roman coin hoard in the county of Norfolk, England.\nThe hoard consists of 25 silver denarii in total, equal to the monthly salary of a Roman legionary \u2014 or citizen soldier.\nAdrian Marsden, a coin specialist for the county, told Fox News Digital the hoard was found in 2023, near the village of Great Ellingham.\nThe numismatist said the cache was found by a lucky metal detectorist, who handed it over to local authorities.\nThe coins were spread throughout the field due to farming activity over the centuries, said Marsden.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few hoards like this over the years, scattered by the plow and often of a similar size,\u201d he said.\nHistorians estimate the coins were lost between the 160s and the 170s.\n\u201cThe latest coins [in the hoard] show very little wear and cannot have seen much circulation before the hoard\u2019s deposition,\u201d Marsden added.\nSeven of the denarii depict Emperor Hadrian, while others show the profiles of Emperor Vespasian and Trajan.\nTwo coins feature Marcus Aurelius \u2014 one during his time as Caesar, another as emperor.\nThe coins had a variety of reverse types, or symbolic images on their tail sides. One is a personification of Africa, as a celebration of Rome\u2019s provinces on the continent.\n\u201cThis was a wealthy agricultural area in the Roman period.\u201d\nAnother artifact was a Judaea Capta coin, minted to commemorate Rome\u2019s capture of Judaea and destruction of the Second Jewish Temple.\nThough an exciting discovery, Marsden noted it\u2019s not unusual for the area.\n\u201cThere are plenty of Roman discoveries in the area, including the occasional small hoard,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis was a wealthy agricultural area in the Roman period.\u201d\nAncient Romans began settling in Britain in 43 A.D. through an invasion led by Emperor Claudius, after a previous invasion under Julius Caesar failed.\nAfter nearly four centuries, the Romans began withdrawing in 410 A.D. \u2013 but not without leaving remnants behind that are still found today in the U.K.\nIn late May, volunteers at an Ancient Roman fort in Northumberland were shocked after they discovered two different 2,000-year-old shoes.\nIn June, a museum in London announced that a giant \u201carchaeological puzzle\u201d had been solved some 1,800 years after it was left by Roman residents.\nFox News Digital\u2019s Sophia Compton contributed reporting."
