  "title": "Why Manchester United are interested in Carlos Baleba, what he offers, and what Brighton think",
  "description": "With the potential Baleba showed last season, it's hardly surprising that he is the next name to be snatched from Brighton's production line",
  "content": "The direction of Manchester United\u2019s rebuild is clear.\n\nThe arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and (imminently) Benjamin Sesko add much-needed firepower to the attacking line, but their profiles also highlight a key attribute that Ruben Amorim desires across the whole team: athleticism.\n\nThat\u2019s why United\u2019s interest in Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s Carlos Baleba makes sense. The 21-year-old is an all-action, front-footed midfielder who hoovers up ground for fun. Not only would he add intensity to the heart of the pitch, but his quality in and out of possession offers something United lack.\n\nThe expectation at Brighton was that clubs would come for Baleba next summer, with The Athletic reporting in July that one other leading Premier League side was monitoring him without being convinced he was ready to make the step up.\n\nUnited\u2019s interest suggests they are trying to get in before any bidding wars begin. Brighton\u2019s desire to hold onto the player, the three years left on his deal, and United\u2019s inability to sell their unwanted players may inhibit that aim. Chelsea have now stepped up talks over taking Alejandro Garnacho to Stamford Bridge, which would add to United\u2019s funds, but Brighton would be looking for similar, if not more, than the \u00a3115m they received for Moises Caicedo in August 2023 if Baleba leaves this summer.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester United\u2019s pre-season friendly against Leeds United, Amorim was open about where his side needed to improve. \u201cWe had a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the shape can be fluid in possession, Amorim\u2019s insistence on a 3-4-2-1 setup means there can often be a strain on a midfield pair to cover ground and protect the centre of the pitch when United lose possession. Therefore, the midfield role requires a high degree of versatility to adjust to the physical demands.\n\nKobbie Mainoo is still developing. Toby Collyer\u2019s future is still uncertain. A breakdown of United\u2019s midfield options reveals gaps within each of their profiles. Manuel Ugarte\u2019s strengths lie more in his defensive work, Bruno Fernandes is undoubtedly more useful on the ball than off it, and Casemiro\u2019s 33-year-old legs are unlikely to sustain the intensity required to cover the ground across a whole season.\n\nUnited need a man who can offer all three attributes to the table. Enter Baleba.\n\nIt speaks to the sharp trajectory of Baleba\u2019s career that United would like to be the third club he plays for in barely three years and all before his 22nd birthday. Just 21 league appearances for Lille in Ligue 1 were enough to convince Brighton that the Cameroon international was ideally suited to fill the boots of the departing Caicedo in the heart of the midfield \u2014 but his Premier League transition was not seamless.\n\nUnderstandably, Baleba needed time to adapt to the intensity of English football. He only managed 15 Premier League starts in 2023-24 \u2014 just 39 per cent of available minutes under Fabian Hurzeler\u2019s predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nLast season saw Baleba\u2019s importance surge, with only Jan Paul van Hecke and Bart Verbruggen getting more league minutes than him in 2024-25. Particularly in the context of United\u2019s options in midfield \u2014 where Fernandes started and finished 28 Premier League matches in 2024-25, as many as Casemiro, Ugarte, Mainoo, and Christian Eriksen combined \u2014 do not overlook Baleba\u2019s availability.\n\nBrighton\u2019s expectation of keeping him this summer extends to their plans for the next midfielder on their production line, 19-year-old Malick Yalcouye, who is expected to have another year developing out on loan.\n\nSifting through Baleba\u2019s profile \u2014 comparing his attributes with other midfielders across Europe\u2019s top five leagues \u2014 it is clear how much he loves to stick a foot in and get involved in Brighton\u2019s defensive work.\n\nNot only is he high-volume in those actions (Front-foot defending, 88 out of 99), but he will come out of his challenges on top more often than not (Tackle success, 88 out of 99). Catching opponents on the blindside and snatching the ball away from them is a skill Baleba has honed very well in the past 18 months.\n\nAs an all-round dueller, Baleba ranks better than what United have. His success rates when tackling, dribbling and in aerial duels put him inside the top quarter of Premier League midfielders last term.\n\nThe real quality of Baleba is that he is something of a hybrid of the two Brighton midfielders to precede him, Caicedo and Yves Bissouma.\n\nCaicedo grew into a box-to-box role but was all about midfield battles, flying into tackles, and chasing down opponents. Bissouma played differently \u2014 he was stylish on the ball and prepared to try to wriggle his way out of dangerous situations, not to mention having more than a penchant for a long shot.\n\nAdd Baleba\u2019s rarity as a left-footed central midfielder and there are few players with his profile in the market.\n\nAccording to SkillCorner, Baleba\u2019s ability to retain possession under pressure was among the best in Europe\u2019s top five leagues when compared with fellow under-23 midfielders, highlighting just how mature he is in looking after the ball in central areas.\n\nGiven his athleticism, Baleba\u2019s ability to wriggle out of trouble by moving dynamically with the ball at his feet is widely known among the Brighton fanbase, with a driving run that can move his side from deeper build-up areas to the middle third in a single breath.\n\nSuch uncoachable press resistance has become particularly sought after for Amorim\u2019s side, especially as the switch to a back three means one extra defender replaces a forward, which reduces the number of exit routes. This is partly why Fernandes and Eriksen were used in deeper roles under Amorim last season.\n\nBaleba filled in at left centre-back on more than one occasion last season, when injury issues and suspension limited Brighton\u2019s options. It adds some extra cover at left centre-back should United need it, and speaks to his comfort at dropping into deep spaces and breaking the first line of pressure.\n\nHe proved that inside five minutes at Old Trafford last season.\n\nWith United sat in a compact mid-block but not applying pressure, Baleba dropped between the centre-backs, collected the ball from Van Hecke, and clipped a pass in-behind for Kaoru Mitoma to chase.\n\nWithin seconds, Mitoma could square it for Yankuba Minteh to tap in, and Brighton were in front.\n\nIt is worth noting that Baleba is not the finished product, nor should he be at 21.\n\nBaleba makes occasional errors \u2014 part of that comes baked in with being so brave on the ball (in the same way that Fernandes can turn over possession when trying to create), but he also overplays at times and can be liable defensively.\n\nHe picked up eight yellow cards last term and twice conceded penalties, one of which was away to United last term, when an overzealous Baleba sprinted back to try to prevent Joshua Zirkzee from getting a shot off. He ended up pulling Zirkzee over and conceding a penalty.\n\nHis sending-off at Bournemouth was a perfect example. While he can count himself slightly unfortunate for collecting a second yellow card for a slide tackle at speed that did get the ball, there could be no complaints for the first yellow card: Baleba had his pocket picked in midfield and had to pull an opponent back to stop a counter-attack.\n\n\u201cThis is the first season he has played regularly,\u201d Hurzeler said in January. \u201cIt is a big change for a young player to be playing most of the time. That is a big development in his profile. He tries to adapt and he tries to improve. At some moments, he is still not really alive, he switches off, and then we have to help him. But generally, he has had a big impact.\n\n\u201cHe brings a physicality and a good balance between the defence and controlling the game in possession. He can score goals, he can defend goals. He has a bright future if he stays grounded and humble with this work ethic.\u201d\n\nBrighton have been set up to replace and replenish their midfield stock in recent years, with Bissouma, Alexis Mac Allister, and Caicedo all moving to \u2018Big Six\u2019 clubs in recent seasons. Given the potential Baleba showed last season, it is hardly surprising that he is the next name to be snatched from the production line.\n\nHow likely a move may be this summer is another question, but Baleba\u2019s profile is clearly in high demand among Europe\u2019s elite.",

  "summary": "Manchester United is reportedly interested in Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba, a 21-year-old midfielder who offers value and intensity. The player's versatility and intensity could help United's midfield position, particularly in the heart of the pitch.

      "text": "Manchester United have made contact with Brighton & Hove Albion, via intermediaries, to explore the conditions of a deal for midfielder Carlos Baleba.\nThe 21-year-old, who has three years left on his Brighton contract, is emerging as one of the most highly-rated players in his position and Brighton do not intend to sanction a sale this summer.\nAdvertisement\nBut interest is building and United are among the many suitors, which has now been relayed through go-betweens.\nBrighton made clear they favour keeping hold of the Cameroon international \u2014 who is under contract until 2028 with an option to extend by 12 months \u2014 for at least another year.\nThere is also a recognition on all sides that a switch now may be unrealistic, especially if United seal their proposed move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.\nUnless the Old Trafford side are able to secure a raft of lucrative sales, it is improbable they can afford big-money recruits up front and in the number six role.\nHowever, those are the two key positions they want to bolster at present and Baleba features prominently among the targets.\nIt should be known in the coming days if the situation can develop or not as United look to continue strengthening head coach Ruben Amorim\u2019s squad.\nIn addition to United\u2019s search for a striker, United are also in the market for a mobile midfielder, as reported in The Athletic\u2019s Transfer DealSheet on July 29.\nThey currently have Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, and Toby Collyer in their ranks, while Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo can also be deployed in the central midfielder positions in Ruben Amorim\u2019s 3-4-3 formation.\nThe Athletic previously reported that Collyer, 21, may leave the club on loan this summer, while Casemiro, 33, has entered the final year of his United contract.\nBaleba joined Brighton from Lille in the summer of 2023 in a deal worth just under \u00a326million ($34.5m) with add-ons.\nDuring his time in the Premier League, the Cameroon international has established himself as one of the division\u2019s most promising young midfielders.\nLast season, he made 40 appearances in all competitions, scoring four goals and providing two assists. Baleba has made seven appearances for Cameroon.\nAdvertisement\nWhy is Baleba so highly rated?\nAnalysis by Manchester United correspondent Carl Anka\nBrighton signed Carlos Baleba in August 2023 to be Moises Caicedo\u2019s successor. Two seasons later and he\u2019s looking like one of the Premier League\u2019s better midfielders.\nHe\u2019s a quality front-foot defender, roaming the middle of the park and snapping into tackles before an opponent has got comfortable on the ball.\nBaleba can tackle and tackle very well but he also has a brilliant appreciation of space and timing, enabling him to intercept opposition passes and put Brighton on the front foot.\nBaleba is an above-average defender when his side are on the back foot. In the moments when Brighton lose the ball and need to retreat, he\u2019s often the man leading the hunt to regain the ball.\nWhen he\u2019s on the ball, he prefers to keep things simple, focusing on retaining possession rather than making any line-breaking passes. He is fond of a switch pass (see his \u2018launched passes\u2019 rating above for an assessment of his passes over longer distances) but his attacking contributions are a bonus to Brighton\u2019s midfield, rather than a key component.\n(Photo: Richard Sellers/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Joao Pedro\u2019s move to Chelsea marks a shift in focus for Brighton & Hove Albion during the summer transfer window.\nUp to now, business has been dominated by additions to Fabian Hurzeler\u2019s squad, five signings costing a total with add-ons of approximately \u00a370million \u2014 about \u00a310m more than the package deal for Joao Pedro.\nAdvertisement\nThe latest newcomer, Belgian left-back Maxim De Cuyper from Club Brugge (\u00a317.3m), increases the options for Hurzeler in a position dominated by Pervis Estupinan for the past three seasons. Italian Diego Coppola (\u00a39.4m) from Hellas Verona and Frenchman Olivier Boscagli (free transfer) from PSV refresh the centre of defence. Teenagers Charalampos Kostoulas (\u00a329.6m striker) from Olympiacos, and Tom Watson (\u00a310m winger) from Sunderland increase Hurzeler\u2019s attacking choices.\nTwo more players are effectively newcomers for the 2025-26 season, having remained initially after signing with the clubs that sold them. Stefanos Tzimas preceded the move made by fellow countryman Kostoulas, the striker joining from Nurnberg for \u00a320m at the end of the January transfer window. That was followed by the arrival of 18-year-old winger Yoon Do-young from Daejeon Hana Citizen for an undisclosed fee. The South Korean will be loaned out in the coming season.\nIt is not necessarily the end of the incomings, according to a source granted anonymity to protect relationships, but the majority of business from now until September 1 will be about trimming back an overlarge squad, mainly via loans but also the odd permanent departure. \u201cWe bought now a lot of players, I think to sell some players, that\u2019s the next part of this process,\u201d head coach Hurzeler told reporters last week.\nBrighton must name a Premier League squad of no more than 25 players born before January 1st, 2004 for the 2025-26 season, with those born after that date not requiring registration (those under-age players include Brajan Gruda, Carlos Baleba and Yankuba Minteh). As it stands, they have 30 players who would require registration. Clearly some will need to be moved on, even if there were to be no more incomings.\nThe Athletic assesses the main candidates to join Joao Pedro through the exit door\u2026\nGoalkeepers\nBrighton have a stack of keepers behind No 1 Bart Verbruggen and second choice Jason Steele. Carl Rushworth has more or less given up on trying to break through after loans for four seasons in succession and six years in total at the club without making a first-team appearance.\nThe 24-year-old former England youth international, with two years left on his existing contract and the option of a further year, is reluctant to sign a new deal. Rushworth is attracting both loan and permanent transfer interest from clubs in the UK.\nAdvertisement\nJames Beadle has joined Championship side Birmingham City on loan for the season after helping England Under-21s to win the European Championship in Slovakia. The 20-year-old had stints on loan at Sheffield Wednesday in the second tier for the past one and a half seasons.\nIt looks as if Dutchman Kjell Scherpen will also be on the move after winning the Bundesliga title in Austria twice in successive seasons on loan at Sturm Graz. The 25-year-old told Kleine Zeitung in May: \u201cFor me, it is clear that I have to play and take the next step. Bart Verbruggen stays in Brighton, so the door is not open to me. Let\u2019s see where the journey is going.\u201d\nDefenders\nThe signing of Coppola and Boscagli causes extra congestion for places in the centre of defence. Jan Paul van Hecke was a mainstay last season and long-serving captain Lewis Dunk is closing in on the number of appearances he needs to trigger a year\u2019s extension to his contract. Igor Julio, Adam Webster and Eiran Cashin could all potentially be struggling for game time.\nIgor, 27, and 30-year-old Webster were limited by a combination of injuries and the pecking order to 10 and 11 league starts respectively last season out of a possible 38. Igor has played elsewhere in Europe previously, having signed from Fiorentina in Italy two years ago. Both the Brazilian and Webster have attracted interest from other Premier League clubs in the past and during the current window.\nCashin only joined at the end of January for \u00a39m from Derby County at the lower end of the Championship. He was a long-term target who is regarded as a long-term project, signed on a contract until 2030. The 23-year-old Irishman, who made two late substitute appearances last season, is a contender for a loan move.\nOne defender has left permanently \u2014 Valentin Barco. His loan switch from Sevilla to Strasbourg in January included an obligation to buy for \u20ac10m (\u00a38.5m). The 20-year-old Argentinian left-back made 14 starts for the Ligue 1 club last season under former Brighton defender Liam Rosenior.\nMidfielders\nThe rumour mill has been quiet so far on Carlos Baleba. At least one leading Premier League club have been monitoring the 21-year-old Cameroon talent without being convinced he is ready to make the next step.\nThe centre of the park is heavily populated after last summer\u2019s hectic transfer business included the \u00a325m signings of Matt O\u2019Riley from Celtic and Mats Wieffer from Feyenoord. Both players suffered through injuries and struggled to establish themselves in their regular positions last season.\nAdvertisement\nO\u2019Riley has been frustrated by not getting a run in the team as a No 8 and he is attracting interest. Brighton are not actively looking to lose the 24-year-old Danish international but, as is the case with all of the club\u2019s players, they will listen to offers at the right price in circumstances that work for them.\nMalick Yalcouye could be loaned out again to further his development after the 19-year-old youth international with Ivory Coast impressed at Sturm Graz.\nAttackers\nThe sale of Joao Pedro means the club will be even more reluctant to lose Kaoru Mitoma as well \u2014 although there are circumstances in which that could still happen.\nMitoma had no interest in moving to the Saudi Pro League in January, when Al Nassr made exceptional bids of \u00a354m and \u00a361m for a player who turned 28 in May.\nA big offer from a heavyweight club in England or another of Europe\u2019s other top leagues, with the added attraction of Champions League football for example, would be more appealing to the Japanese left winger. He is motivated by career progression, not money. Until and unless such an offer comes in and there is a decision to be made, Mitoma will remain a Brighton player. He is happy and settled at the club, with two years still remaining on his current contract, although reports of him wanting to sign a new deal and stay have been described to The Athletic as \u201cfake news\u201d by sources close to the player.\nKeeping Mitoma, coupled with the signing of Watson, would raise a question mark over the future of Simon Adingra. The 23-year-old Ivory Coast winger only made 12 league starts under Hurzeler last season.\nFacundo Buonanotte (Leicester City), Julio Enciso (Ipswich Town) and Evan Ferguson (West Ham United) all had loans last season at other Premier League clubs. All three players could be on the move again. Another domestic loan would qualify Argentinian Buonanotte as homegrown in his fourth year at the club. Enciso, 21, is the likeliest of the trio to leave permanently.\n(Top photo: Jacob King/PA Images via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Even those with a moderate interest in data will have seen that player pizza charts are a staple visualisation in the world of football analytics.\nThese graphics can be a valuable starting point in breaking down a player\u2019s stylistic profile with a single glance, with this style of visualisation being a key theme at The Athletic over the years, from smarterscout pizza charts to team playstyle wheels.\nAdvertisement\nThis summer, we have had a refresh. Allow us to present our player pizza charts 2.0 \u2014 all right, maybe the title could be catchier, but the visual is exciting.\nHere, we use Opta data (via FBref) to create some new metrics broken down into defence, possession, progression and attack across Europe\u2019s top five leagues \u2014 the Premier League (England), Bundesliga (Germany), La Liga (Spain), Ligue 1 (France), and Serie A (Italy).\nHowever, rather than the same metrics for every player across every position, we now have bespoke graphics with metrics that are most relevant to the respective position.\nFirst, how do you read these player graphics? Much like other pizza charts in The Athletic\u2019s suite, each player is given a \u201cpercentile\u201d rating between zero and 99 for each metric. Put simply, the higher the number, the more frequently \u2014 or efficiently \u2014 the player performs this action compared with their positional peers.\nInstead of inundating you with endless \u201cper 90\u201d numbers, we prefer to strip things back and present the percentile numbers, allowing you to assess a player\u2019s stylistic profile easily and quickly.\nYou may also notice that we have rebranded a few established metrics to ensure we are speaking \u201cfootball language\u201d throughout and not drowning you in any technical terms.\nSo let\u2019s walk you through what we have, alongside some examples\u2026\nDefence\nFront-foot defending \u2014 this looks at how often a player goes hunting for defensive actions, measured as tackles attempted, challenges attempted, fouls committed, interceptions plus blocked passes per 90 minutes. To account for the opportunity to perform such actions, this metric is adjusted for a team\u2019s possession.\nTackle success \u2014 this looks at the percentage of tackles won as a share of all tackles attempted, challenges attempted and fouls committed.\nBack-foot defending \u2014 this looks at more reactive defensive actions, measured as blocked shots and clearances per 90 minutes. Again, this metric is adjusted for a team\u2019s possession.\nLoose ball recoveries \u2014 this shows how often a player retrieves the ball when neither side has it. A good proxy for a player\u2019s inclination to hoover up potential danger or anticipate where the ball is going to land to restart their team\u2019s possession.\nAdvertisement\nAerial volume \u2014 simply a player\u2019s aerial duels contested per 90 to indicate their propensity to compete in the air.\nAerial success \u2014 you will have guessed this one. The percentage of aerial duels won as a share of total aerial duels contested.\nAn easy example to run through is Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. As illustrated below using last season\u2019s stats, the centre-back regularly competes for headers (Aerial volume, 79 out of 99) and is one of the best in Europe in winning those battles (Aerial success, 94 out of 99).\nRegularly Liverpool\u2019s defensive safety net, Van Dijk\u2019s back-foot defending ranks highly (91 out of 99). Somewhat surprisingly, he does not always come out with the ball when he makes a challenge (Tackle success, 31 out of 99), often committing low-risk fouls that still manage to kill the opposition\u2019s attack.\nAs a bonus defensive metric, we have also included the following for full-backs:\nOne-v-one defending \u2014 this looks at the percentage of dribblers tackled as a share of total dribblers challenged. A frequent task for any full-back and a good proxy for their defensive solidity.\nHaving finally been given a run of games in a Tottenham Hotspur shirt, full-back Djed Spence showed himself to be near-immovable in a one-v-one situation, with the strength and athleticism to swat most wingers to one side when they dared to cross his path.\nPossession\nLink-up play \u2014 the percentage of short or medium-distance passes as a share of total passes made. Often teases out the technicians whose job it is to keep the play ticking over in a metronomic fashion.\nBall retention \u2014 the percentage of passes completed as a share of total passes attempted. It might not be the sharpest of tools, but it shows a player\u2019s inclination (or tactical instruction) to look after possession.\nLaunched passes \u2014 the percentage of long-distance passes as a share of total passes made. While purely stylistic, you will often \u2014 but not always \u2014 find that players operating for direct teams rate highly for this metric.\nSurely the best example for this season is Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s quadruple-winning midfielder Vitinha. With an ability to evade pressure, he looks after the ball like his life depends on it (Ball retention, 98 out of 99), predominantly keeping those passes short (Link-up play, 98 out of 99) but not shy to ping a cross-field ball when the situation allows it (Launched passes, 67 out of 99).\nProgression\nCreative threat \u2014 this is a combination of a player\u2019s expected assists (xA) and actual assists per 90 minutes, with an 80 per cent to 20 per cent weighting towards xA to provide a more accurate view of a player\u2019s creative process rather than restricting it to the outcome.\nCross volume \u2014 the number of crosses made per 100 touches in the attacking third.\nDribble volume \u2014 the number of dribbles attempted per 100 touches. This accounts for a player\u2019s opportunity to perform this action, rather than purely highlighting those operating for dominant teams.\nPass progression \u2014 the number of progressive passes as a share of total passes made. This shows a player\u2019s inclination to make a progressive pass when given equal opportunity.\nCarry progression \u2014 the number of progressive carries as a share of total carries made. This shows a player\u2019s inclination to make a progressive carry when given equal opportunity.\nAdvertisement\nProgressive receptions \u2014 the volume of progressive passes received as a share of total passes received. This is often a good proxy for a player who likes to stay high and wide or ghost between opposition lines to find a pocket of space.\nAn obvious yet interesting example is the mercurial talent of Florian Wirtz, Liverpool\u2019s new playmaker. His creative numbers at Bayer Leverkusen were easily among the best in Europe (Creative threat, 96 out of 99), but the data shows he is more than just an output monster.\nA low \u2018Pass progression\u2019 rating (37 out of 99) is likely due to his sheer involvement in Leverkusen\u2019s play last season (Link-up play, 99 out of 99) \u2014 showing his all-round game to get on the ball. Often receiving in advanced areas (Progressive receptions, 72 out of 99), Wirtz is brave in asking for the ball with bodies around him \u2014 desperate to play the killer pass and not simply pull wide to deliver a hopeful ball (Cross volume, 37 out of 99).\nAttack\nGoal threat \u2014 this is a combination of a player\u2019s expected goals (xG) and actual goals per 90 minutes, with a 70 per cent to 30 per cent weighting towards xG to provide a more accurate view of a player\u2019s ability to generate chances.\nShot frequency \u2014 the number of non-penalty shots per 100 touches. This can tease out those who only have eyes for goal from those who contribute more widely to their team\u2019s attack.\nBox threat \u2014 the number of touches in the penalty area as a share of total touches in the attacking two-thirds of the pitch. This often separates the roaming false 9s from those who stay between the width of the six-yard box.\nShot quality \u2014 the average quality of a given chance, denoted by xG per shot. This is often a good measure of a player\u2019s ability to get into good areas to score and can have good predictive value for future performance.\nA good example is one of Europe\u2019s most coveted strikers, Alexander Isak. With attacking output that is in the elite category (Goal threat, 89 out of 99), it is interesting that the 25-year-old is not all about shooting volume (Shot frequency, 70 out of 99) \u2014 most likely because he is drifting into spaces to offer a creative threat and not just stay between the width of the posts (Box threat, 80 out of 99).\nCould he improve the quality of those efforts? Possibly (Shot quality, 80 out of 99), but being such a well-rounded striker means that he cannot always help to create a chance and be on the end of it at the same time.\nKeep an eye out for more of these visualisations on The Athletic, across the transfer window this summer and into the 2025-26 campaign.

      "text": "It is unusual for an opposing manager to speak with certainty about the prospects of a rival player.\nBut before Brentford travelled to the Amex Stadium to face Brighton pre-Christmas, the Londoners\u2019 head coach Thomas Frank said: \u201c(Carlos) Baleba is an excellent midfielder. He will go to one of the bigger clubs in the future, for sure.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIf Frank is right, it is more a case of when than if Baleba becomes the subject of substantial transfer interest.\nBrighton are accustomed to this scenario, particularly with their central midfielders. Yves Bissouma was sold to Tottenham in the summer of 2022, then Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo to Liverpool and Chelsea respectively a year later. Could Baleba be the next in line?\nNothing will happen in the winter window that opened on Wednesday. Brighton are not in the business of losing their best players mid-season, particularly when they are in 10th position under Fabian Hurzeler in a tightly congested top half of the Premier League table. They are firmly in contention to achieve their aim of qualifying for Europe for the second time in three years.\nArsenal learned all about Brighton\u2019s January intransigence two years ago while making a determined pursuit of Caicedo. They had multiple bids of up to \u00a360million ($74.2m at current exchange rates) for the Ecuadorian rejected. Chelsea tested the water in the same window with an offer of \u00a355m and eventually got their man that summer, but it cost them a British record package of \u00a3115m after Caicedo had helped Brighton to qualify for the Europa League under Hurzeler\u2019s predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi.\nCould history repeat itself with the sale of Baleba come the summer? Brighton\u2019s stance will be the same as it was with Bissouma, Mac Allister and Caicedo if the 20-year-old Cameroon international continues to catch the eye. They will not want to sell but will do so \u2014 providing the finances and the circumstances are right for both them and Baleba.\nPart of the reason Brighton\u2019s recruitment model works so well is that players know they will get a chance to develop and improve with them. If the player delivers, they also know the club will not block their path if an opportunity comes along to join a bigger club paying much higher wages than Brighton do.\nAdvertisement\nAnother aspect of this recruitment model is forward planning.\nCaicedo was signed from Independiente del Valle in his homeland for around \u00a34million in the winter window four years ago to eventually succeed Bissouma. Baleba was bought in August 2023 from France\u2019s Lille for \u00a326m to replace Caicedo. And Brighton are already well-stocked in central midfield if he in turn attracts interest this summer.\nBaleba has played with three different partners in the past three matches. In Monday\u2019s 2-2 draw at Aston Villa, he was reunited with Sweden international Yasin Ayari, after they had been deployed together in December away to Leicester (drew 2-2) and at home against Crystal Palace (lost 3-1).\nDuring Brighton\u2019s current run of seven matches without a win, Baleba has also played alongside two of the nine signings the club made in last summer\u2019s window for a total outlay of almost \u00a3200million.\nMats Wieffer scored his first goal for the club in the 1-1 away draw against West Ham just before Christmas. The Netherlands international, bought from Eredivisie side Feyenoord for \u00a325million, went off shortly afterwards with a leg injury. Wieffer was replaced six days later in the goalless draw with Brentford by another \u00a325m purchase from that same window \u2014 English-born Denmark international Matt O\u2019Riley, who arrived from Scottish champions Celtic.\nBaleba has been an ever-present since missing the 1-1 home draw against Southampton at the end of November which launched the winless sequence. He was suspended for that match following a controversial red card in the preceding 2-1 win at Bournemouth for what were deemed two bookable offences.\nDATE | OPPONENT | VENUE | PLAYER | PLAYER |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nDecember 30 | Aston Villa | Away | Carlos Baleba | Yasin Ayari |\nDecember 27 | Brentford | Home | Carlos Baleba | Matt O'Riley |\nDecember 21 | West Ham | Away | Carlos Baleba | Mats Wieffer |\nDecember 15 | Crystal Palace | Home | Carlos Baleba | Yasin Ayari |\nDecember 8 | Leicester | Away | Carlos Baleba | Yasin Ayari |\nDecember 5 | Fulham | Away | Carlos Baleba | Mats Wieffer |\nNovember 29 | Southampton | Home | Yasin Ayari | Matt O'Riley |\nIn total, Brighton have used eight different central midfield partnerships this season, also involving Jack Hinshelwood, James Milner and Billy Gilmour, before the latter\u2019s move to Napoli of Italy late in the summer transfer window. England Under-21 Hinshelwood is expected back from a knee injury soon having missed the past eight games. Milner, who turns 39 this weekend, hasn\u2019t played since the 1-1 away draw against Arsenal in August because of a hamstring problem.\nAdvertisement\nDiego Gomez has been added to the midfield mix following an \u00a311million move this week from MLS club Inter Miami.\nThe 21-year-old, a box-to-box Paraguay international, officially became a Brighton player on January 1 with the opening of the winter window but will not be involved against Arsenal at the Amex tomorrow. He is likely to make his debut instead in the third round of the FA Cup, away to Championship side Norwich, next Saturday.\nHurzeler, speaking about Gomez during his press conference on Thursday, said: \u201cWhen I saw him running \u2014 he was running during our training sessions \u2014 I saw a beast. (It) is unbelievable how intense he can play football, and he proved it in the MLS.\nGO DEEPER\nDiego Gomez to Brighton & Hove Albion: The Athletic 500 transfer ratings\n\u201cThat is why we are really happy that he brings us this attitude, this physicality, and I am sure he will also improve as a player. So, I am really looking forward to working with him.\u201d\nBaleba also brings physicality and mobility to Brighton\u2019s midfield, as well as a goal threat (three in his 18 appearances this season across all competitions). Having only turned 20 today, he is still naive in his defensive positioning at times and prone to lapses of concentration, but Hurzeler sees the scale of his potential.\n\u201cThis is the first season he has played regularly,\u201d Hurzeler also said on Thursday. \u201cIt is a big change for a young player to be playing most of the time. That is a big development in his profile. He tries to adapt and he tries to improve. At some moments he is still not really alive, he switches off, and then we have to help him. But generally, he has had a big impact so far.\nGO DEEPER\nBrighton's 2024: Beating Man City, a nightmare in Rome and the great Spurs comeback\n\u201cHe brings a physicality and a good balance between the defence and controlling the game in possession. He can score goals, he can defend goals. He has a bright future if he stays grounded and humble with this work ethic.\u201d\nMalick Yalcouye, signed last summer from IFK Gothenburg in Sweden for an initial \u00a37.6million plus add-ons, is another midfield prospect who will come into the reckoning in 2025-26. Brighton considered triggering a January recall option in the versatile 19-year-old\u2019s season-long loan with Sturm Graz before deciding to leave him with the Austrian Champions League participants for the remainder of the campaign.\nIf Brighton achieve their goal of qualifying for Europe, squad depth becomes more important and rotation more manageable \u2014 but a summer departure for Baleba cannot be discounted.\n(Top photo: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Chelsea have stepped up talks with Manchester United over a move for winger Alejandro Garnacho.\nThe clubs have been in touch over Garnacho for some time but talks have now advanced, and Garnacho expects to move to Stamford Bridge.\nThe 21-year-old has ruled out all options this summer, aside from joining Chelsea and staying put at Old Trafford.\nThe Athletic reported in June that Garnacho was one of five United players permitted to return to pre-season training late after reporting in May that United head coach Ruben Amorim had told the 21-year-old, in front of his team-mates, to find a new club.\nChelsea\u2019s increased interest in Garnacho comes after United agreed a deal in principle with RB Leipzig for the transfer of striker Benjamin Sesko. The Athletic reported on Thursday that a deal worth \u20ac76.5million (\u00a366.4m; $89.1m) and \u20ac8.5m in add-ons is in place between the clubs, with Sesko given permission to travel for medical tests ahead of the proposed move.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea have held a long-standing interest in Garnacho and he would be the second United winger in as many campaigns to join Chelsea after Jadon Sancho moved to Stamford Bridge on loan last season. He would also be the ninth of the London club\u2019s summer signings, including wingers Jamie Gittens and Estevao, after winning the Club World Cup and Conference League last season.\nA price of \u00a370million has previously been communicated to suitors.\nAmorim and Garnacho have had a turbulent relationship at times. The \u2018new club\u2019 comment followed United\u2019s Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, where the Argentina international was introduced as a 71st-minute substitute.\nAfter the final, Garnacho said he would \u201csee what happens\u201d following a summer break and expressed his frustrations at not playing a greater role in the final.\n\u201cUp until the final, I\u2019ve played every round, and today to play 20 minutes\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\nThe Athletic reported in January that United would reluctantly consider selling Garnacho in the winter transfer window, alongside fellow homegrown talent Kobbie Mainoo, as to help them comply with the Premier League\u2019s financial rules.\nUnited rejected an approach from Napoli that month and while he stayed at Old Trafford, his reaction to being substituted off against Ipswich Town the following month prompted Amorim to reveal the forward had to pay for a team dinner by means of an apology.\nHe made 58 appearances in all competitions and provided 11 goals and 10 assists, but this was amid long-term absences for Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad, while Marcus Rashford and Antony both left United on loan deals in the January transfer window without replacements.\nGarnacho joined United\u2019s academy from Atletico Madrid in October 2020 and has made 144 senior appearances for the club, scoring 26 goals.\n(Photo: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Manchester United require a squad rebuild. (Again.)\nThe Athletic would like to offer some help. (Again.)\nWelcome to another edition of \u2018Shopping for Amorim\u2019, where we look into areas that United\u2019s head coach may look to strengthen before the upcoming 2025-26 season.\nPart one of this series looked at strikers. Part two will go over central midfielders.\nWhat does Amorim typically ask his central midfielders to do?\nRun. And tackle. A lot.\nAmorim\u2019s 3-4-3 system at Sporting CP saw him prefer two athletic players to work as box-to-box midfielders. Early build-up phases in games were primarily handled by the back three and wing-backs, meaning Amorim\u2019s central midfielders\u2019 most notable contributions occurred when the team was out of possession.\nAdvertisement\nThings altered somewhat in 2023 following the arrival of Morten Hjulmand, a clever midfielder with good passing accuracy over longer distances, but Amorim, on the whole, enjoys shin-kickers and ground-eaters to play in the midfield pivot; midfielders who possess an uncanny ability to turn moments of defence into attacking dominance with a smart foul and a smarter switch pass.\nAmorim previously worked with Manuel Ugarte at Sporting. Shouldn\u2019t he be perfect for the role?\nThe head coach has cited Ugarte\u2019s improvement in possession since their time together in Portugal but has repeatedly substituted the Uruguayan when United were in search of a goal. Ugarte\u2019s strengths as a defensive midfielder are most prominent when his team are retreating.\nHowever, Amorim\u2019s decision to leave Ugarte on the bench for the Europa League final suggests the 24-year-old will be more of a special-use player for the upcoming season.\nUgarte\u2019s tenacity when tackling and chasing after the ball are useful when United are trying to put out a fire, yet Amorim may now want someone who can spot the metaphorical smoke and stop problems before they become truly hazardous; a player who takes a proactive form of out-of-possession work, pressing high and blocking off passing lanes.\nAnd the club\u2019s other midfield options?\nMatheus Cunha\u2019s arrival, coupled with the pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, suggests Bruno Fernandes will spend the foreseeable future playing in central midfield for Amorim.\nA 26-year-old Casemiro might have worked as the club captain\u2019s midfield partner but a 33-year-old Casemiro will need assistance covering larger areas of space.\nThe head coach has spoken of Kobbie Mainoo\u2019s improvement but appears to prefer the England international in the No 10 position rather than the more combative midfield pivot. Part of that is due to Mainoo\u2019s relative lack of pace, leaving him vulnerable when facing the Premier League\u2019s more physical teams. This tactical decision may also have roots in Mainoo\u2019s still-to-develop progressive passing over longer distances. (If Mainoo returned to Old Trafford with a consistent and precise switch pass, he could form a role in Amorim\u2019s midfield similar to Youri Tielemans for Aston Villa.)\nToby Collyer has the athletic ability to cover larger areas of space but it remains to be seen whether he has the passing ability over longer distances. Amorim took the 19-year-old Sekou Kone on United\u2019s post-season tour and he could be a player to monitor over their upcoming tour to the United States.\nAdvertisement\nUnited fans who grew weary of Harry Maguire\u2019s long diagonals to Patrick Dorgu during that Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao and will want a midfielder who is comfortable passing and receiving under pressure.\nA player who can drop deep and ease the passing burden on Amorim\u2019s back three would serve as an extra pressure valve when games get nervy. If said midfielder is skilled at carrying the ball across short distances, that would be a bonus too.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some players that might just fit the bill.\nThe new Premier League darling: Carlos Baleba\nBrighton signed Carlos Baleba in August 2023 to be Moises Caicedo\u2019s successor. Two seasons later and he\u2019s looking like one of the Premier League\u2019s better midfielders.\n(The above graphic totals the many actions a player does across a season, before giving them a rating from 0-99. The scores then relate to how often they do a given action compared with others playing in their position \u2014 such as carry progression or shot volume, or by how effective they are \u2014 such as tackle success. The more rounded the radar, the more complete the player.)\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the Brighton man:\n- He\u2019s a quality front-foot defender, roaming the middle of the park and snapping into tackles before an opponent has got comfortable on the ball. Baleba can tackle and tackle very well but he also has a brilliant appreciation of space and timing, enabling him to intercept opposition passes and put Brighton on the front foot.\n- Baleba is an above-average defender when his side are on the back foot. In the moments when Brighton lose the ball and need to retreat, he\u2019s often the man leading the hunt to regain the ball.\n- When he\u2019s on the ball, he prefers to keep things simple, focusing on retaining possession rather than making any line-breaking passes. He is fond of a switch pass (see his \u2018launched passes\u2019 rating above for an assessment of his passes over longer distances) but his attacking contributions are a bonus to Brighton\u2019s midfield, rather than a key component.\nBaleba serves as the Premier League-tested central midfielder that more than one club would like to sign.\nOne from Ligue 1: Lamine Camara\nDeclan Rice got a glimpse of Lamine Camara\u2019s skills during England\u2019s 3-1 defeat to Senegal earlier this month. The 21-year-old was a star of the show at the City Ground, disrupting passing lanes and rarely letting Rice \u2014 or any other England player \u2014 settle.\nCamara spent the 2024-25 season playing for Monaco. He might be on the move sooner rather than later.\nHere\u2019s what the above graphic is telling you about Camara:\n- He\u2019s an exceptional front-foot defender and is able to spot \u2018the pass before the pass\u2019 and make moves to stop it before the opposition can get closer to goal. Camara is ambitious when pushing up from midfield to make an interception. He\u2019s clever but a bit of a gambler. This makes him well-suited to teams that want to maintain pressure on opponents, keeping them in their own half.\n- Like Baleba, he\u2019s good when defending on the back foot. Camara\u2019s gambles in pushing up don\u2019t always work but he has the defensive intensity and pace to get back and clean up any mistakes.\n- That said, his tackling technique isn\u2019t the cleanest (see: his \u2018tackle success\u2019 rating of 63). He is yet to develop a go-to method for making a standing tackle or sliding tackle in the same way as Casemiro. This should develop over time but currently, Camara can attempt many tackles, but those attempts don\u2019t always result in success (Ugarte had similar issues last season).\n- He\u2019s a deceptively good long passer for someone playing in defensive midfield. Look at the high scores for \u2018launched passes\u2019 and \u2018creative threat\u2019. When Camara manages to win the ball, his first instinct isn\u2019t to make a sideways pass to someone more talented. He gets his head up and wants to get the ball to team-mates on the move.\nOne from the Championship: Hayden Hackney\nMiddlesbrough\u2019s Hayden Hackney looks ready to make the jump from the Championship to the Premier League.\nWhat makes the 22-year-old such an alluring prospect? That would be his approach to passing. A look at his most common progressive passes reveals a talented deep-lying playmaker, fond of wriggling into the half-spaces before getting the ball in and around the penalty box.\nYou can tell this is a player who spent three years working under Michael Carrick at the Riverside. This is someone who progresses the ball in a speedy but sensible manner.\nOut of possession, his ability to cover ground is remarkable. He\u2019s an all-action player but someone who appreciates the need for subtlety and stillness too.\nHere\u2019s who United could look at if Sir Jim Ratcliffe won the EuroMillions jackpot\nAdam Wharton is brilliant. It would be unwise for Oliver Glasner and Crystal Palace\u2019s higher-ups to sanction a sale for less than \u00a375million.\nWharton\u2019s passing range, intelligence and vision make for an intoxicating combination. The 21-year-old knows how to hit a raking long pass to switch play and change the angle of his team\u2019s attack, but also understands when to temper things and slow things down. He might be the closest thing to a modern-day Carrick in the Premier League today.\nAngelo Stiller, meanwhile, has gone from strength to strength for Stuttgart in recent seasons. The German side finished ninth in the Bundesliga last season but Stiller\u2019s talents are such that he\u2019s likely on the move to a club with Champions League football in 2025-26.\nHere are some more cost-effective suggestions\nSooner or later, a Premier League club is going to make a move for Lucien Agoume (Arsenal have an interest in the Sevilla midfielder). The 23-year-old has gained attention for his performances for France at the Under-21 European Championship.\nAgoume is a tall (1.88m/6ft 2in), combative midfielder who enjoys getting stuck in. Leganes\u2019 Oscar Rodriguez learned this the hard way in May, getting bumped off the ball with the sort of front-footed tackle Agoume enjoys.\nThe Frenchman is the sort of midfielder that\u2019s hard to battle with once he gets in a shoulder-to-shoulder encounter. His tackling technique when retreating may need a little refinement (he collected five yellow cards and one red in La Liga last season), but this is a defensive midfielder who doesn\u2019t shirk the dirty work.\nHe\u2019s also fond of a line-breaking pass. Take a look at this 60-yard through ball to team-mate Dodi Lukebakio. His technical ability on the ball has already invited comparisons to other great French midfielders.\nAgoume offers a range of clever responses to various sticky situations; a front-footed ball winner who can pass and carry the ball to a high standard in equal measure. If United were to make a move for him, they\u2019d likely have to contend with Arsenal for his signature.\nHere are some names we\u2019ve recommended in the past\nManuel Locatelli has appeared on Athletic midfield shortlists since 2021. Where he was once touted as \u2018The Next Big Thing\u2019 for Italy\u2019s midfield, he has now grown into a Steady Eddie of a central midfielder. Locatelli is the sort of midfielder who doesn\u2019t pop up in too many post-match highlight packages but knows how to keep things ticking along.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2024, our defensive midfielder piece was tied to Mainoo\u2019s skillset, and suggested Anton Stach and Morten Frendrup among our options. Stach was a dependable regular in a Hoffenheim side that had a mediocre 2024-25 season, finishing 15th in the league. He remains a tall (193cm/6ft 4in), tough-tackling operator in the middle of the pitch. He is not a consistent progressive passer over longer distances, but he can carry the ball well and doesn\u2019t mind moonlighting at full-back when needed. (Similar to Collyer.)\nFrendrup finished 13th in Serie A with Genoa last season and is a solid midfielder. The Denmark international is fond of peeling off to the right wing when attacking, looking to provide low crosses and pull-backs for team-mates.\nTrying to explain the many layers of United\u2019s midfield in only 2,000 words is difficult\nWondering why the likes of Atalanta\u2019s Ederson or Aston Villa\u2019s Boubacar Kamara are yet to be mentioned in this piece? That\u2019s because United have so many foibles and footnotes affecting their midfield engine room, one can present shortlists on top of shortlists for their problem position(s).\nFernandes didn\u2019t appear well-suited to a box-to-box midfield role at the start of last season yet made adjustments to his game following the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at Anfield. If the captain continues his good form, then United can go shopping for more of a tackler than a long passer.\nIf Fernandes has more of the issues he encountered in the Europa League final, that complicates things. (Our recommendations of Valencia\u2019s Javi Guerra and Nottingham Forest\u2019s Elliot Anderson can only be in passing for now.)\nUnited\u2019s midfield is a knotty situation that may require two signings, but budgets may only stretch to one player. Amorim and his staff will need to be strategic in their recruitment and coaching for the role going forward.\n(Top photos: Carlos Baleba, left, and Lucien Agoume; Getty Images)"

      "text": "Good things come in threes \u2014 or at least Ruben Amorim will be hoping so.\nThe Manchester United head coach is set to completely refresh his forward line with the addition of three exciting new attacking options this summer. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joined earlier in the window, and now the club have agreed a deal with RB Leipzig for centre-forward Benjamin Sesko that will take their spending on a new attack for the 2025-26 season past \u00a3200million ($268m).\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s a tantalising prospect for United fans. While their defence was found sorely wanting last season, shipping 54 goals, United have still managed to finish sixth in the Premier League on three occasions in the past decade when conceding this number or more. Instead, it was their stuttering attack that proved more damaging: United scored just 44 times in the domestic top flight, their lowest-ever return in the 33-year Premier League era.\nSo it\u2019s an area that clearly demanded a reboot. But can this new trio gel, and flourish, within Amorim\u2019s system?\nProjecting how an individual will perform after changing club is always fraught with uncertainty. The crystal ball becomes murkier still when trying to anticipate the chemistry of an entirely-rebuilt forward line. Still, the roles and performances of these three in recent seasons offer encouraging signs that they can complement and even elevate each other\u2019s strengths as United team-mates.\nThe most basic test of this fluidity is positional: will they get in each other\u2019s way? We don\u2019t know what exact configuration Amorim will settle on \u2014 Sesko has yet to actually sign, while Mbeumo and Cunha have played just 45 minutes together in last weekend\u2019s pre-season friendly against Everton \u2014 but on paper, they appear well-balanced as a unit.\nLooking at their touch maps from last season, Mbeumo shows a strong preference for the right flank, Cunha drifts inside from the left rather than hugging the touchline, and Sesko typically operates through the middle, making it entirely feasible for United to start all three in their favoured positions.\nBut simply slotting three talented players into the roles where they are happiest is no guarantee of chemistry. What matters most is how they interact. Does the centre-forward make the kind of runs the wide players like to pick out? Do they play the passes the guy up front thrives on? Will they be able to press as a coherent unit?\nAdvertisement\nCunha and Mbeumo profile as near mirror images of one another, which should allow them to dovetail naturally and play off each other. Both excel at driving their teams up the pitch with surging ball carries and progressive passes \u2014 the kind of attacking profiles United sorely lacked last season, as shown in the graphic below. Cunha also brings the added benefit of having played as a left-sided No 10 for Wolves in a 3-4-2-1 system, the same setup Amorim is steadfastly committed to at United.\nWhat\u2019s less clear is how these wide attackers will link up with Sesko.\nPart of that uncertainty stems from the 22-year-old Slovenian\u2019s relative inexperience, coupled with his two contrasting campaigns at Leipzig that muddy the waters when it comes to identifying his natural playing style.\nWhen Sesko first signed for the Germans in summer 2023, he was deployed as a classic penalty-box striker \u2014 playing on the shoulder of the last defender, with most of his touches concentrated in advanced areas. But then last season, as Leipzig\u2019s form cratered and their attacking issues began to resemble United\u2019s, the creative supply line faltered. Sesko was often forced to drop deeper to get involved in the play.\nFor a better sense of how he might fit into the United jigsaw, we can look at the kind of centre-forwards Cunha and Mbeumo have thrived alongside in the past, what Amorim typically demands from his strikers, and how well Sesko matches that profile.\nWhile they share stylistic traits, Mbeumo and Cunha tend to look for slightly different things from their front man.\nFor starters, Mbeumo enjoyed a much stronger partnership with Yoane Wissa at Brentford last season than Cunha did with Wolves team-mate Jorgen Strand Larsen.\nMbeumo combined with Wissa 166 times, compared to just 80 passes between Cunha and Strand Larsen, albeit that was their fourth year playing together compared wth the first for the Wolves duo. But for the Cameroon international, it wasn\u2019t just about this link-up play. Mbeumo thrived just as much on Wissa\u2019s tireless off-ball movement, which intelligently created space for him to exploit. The sight of Wissa dragging a defender away with an overlapping or underlapping run, allowing Mbeumo to cut inside and curl one in with his left foot, became a regular feature at the Gtech Community Stadium last season.\nAdvertisement\nBy contrast, Cunha typically looked for Strand Larsen to drop deep, using the Norwegian\u2019s imposing physical frame to play quick wall passes that allowed him to burst towards the edge of the box as he cut inside from the left. One such sequence is shown below, taken from the 3-0 home win against Leicester in April.\nAcross both his seasons at Leipzig, Sesko showed this willingness to drop deep and link up with his midfield.\nAccording to tracking data from SkillCorner, he ranked highly among European strikers for both runs coming short and runs that support the ball carrier in each of his Bundesliga campaigns. This suggests he can offer Cunha and Mbeumo a platform for quick, fluid, short-passing combinations.\nBut it\u2019s long, direct runs into the channels that Amorim truly prizes in his centre-forwards \u2014 movements that stretch defences and open up space for the team\u2019s two No 10s to attack.\nSesko made more of these runs during his debut campaign, but they became less frequent as Leipzig\u2019s overall form declined. By contrast, existing United forward Rasmus Hojlund has consistently shown a willingness to make such runs, even if he often remains peripheral in build-up play.\nUnited\u2019s style under their Portuguese coach is based on slow, patient build-up \u2014 only Manchester City recorded a lower direct speed in the league last season \u2014 but long passes into the channels for the striker remain a key tactical outlet. While Hojlund may be more eager to make these kinds of movements, the issue lies in what happens when the ball is actually played to him.\nDespite standing at 6ft 3in (191cm), Hojlund struggles in the air, winning just 25 per cent of his aerial duels last season \u2014 a figure that ranks him near the bottom among strikers across Europe. What the 6ft 5in Sesko may lack in movement, he makes up for with his ability to make the ball stick. The scatter plot below highlights just how much more aerially dominant he is than Hojlund (or his fellow 6ft 3in United striker Joshua Zirkzee).\nHe also far outstrips the Dane for successful take-ons per 90 minutes \u2014 an important trait for when long balls are lumped forward and a striker must fend off defenders while waiting for the attacking cavalry to come over the hill.\nUnited don\u2019t yet have the structure behind their attack to support an Erling Haaland-type forward \u2014 one who loiters around the box, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Their No 9 will need to roll up his sleeves, get his shorts muddy, and be very much involved. And there\u2019s plenty of evidence that Sesko is more than willing to do just that.\nAdvertisement\nBut perhaps most encouraging is his Haaland-like knack for finding and finishing chances, regardless of what\u2019s going on behind him. Leipzig have endured two topsy-turvy campaigns, yet Sesko hit double figures for goals in both.\nIn fact, all three of United\u2019s new forwards scored more than 10 times last season.\nThe easiest and quickest way for them to build chemistry and confidence is to carry that trait over to their new team.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"
