Generate Key Takeaways\n\nWhile Young Thug and Gunna used to be the closest of friends, there has been an insurmountable amount of tension brewing between the two Atlanta rappers in recent months.\n\u2022 None Lil Nas X's Dad Says Music Industry Pressure Led to Rapper's Arrest, Jailing: 'We All Have Breakdowns Every Now and Then'\n\nSince being released following his YSL RICO case in Georgia, Young Thug has continuously thrown jabs at his former labelmate Gunna over allegations that he cooperated with law enforcement to secure his freedom. While the issues between the two rappers haven\u2019t played out in the public view much, Thug did admit to GQ that relations between them weren\u2019t what they used to be.\n\n\u201cI know everybody wonders [what our relationship is like now],\u201d Thugga noted in April, before saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHe did not elaborate further, leaving more questions than answers. As fans started to accept that maybe they\u2019d never fully learn about what happened between Wunna and Thugga, things finally came to a serious head on Tuesday (Sept. 2). Alleged leaked phone calls of Young Thug speaking to 21 Savage from jail hit the internet, all but confirming that the once-fruitful relationship between Gunna and Young Thug was no more.\n\nSo the question remains: How did such close ties between two Atlanta stars unravel so quickly? From the pair\u2019s early days before the rise of YSL to subliminal disses and plenty of tweet-and-deletes, there are a lot of breadcrumbs leading us to this very moment. Here is the full breakdown of Gunna and Young Thug\u2019s relationship and a look at how things got to this point.\n\n2015: Young Thug and Gunna Meet for the First Time\n\nGunna and Thugga first interacted back in 2015, after they were introduced through mutual friend and local Atlanta community leader Keith \u201cKing\u201d Troup. At the time, Young Thug was deep in his Barter 6 run, and Gunna stopped by the rapper\u2019s \u201cWith That\u201d music video shoot for an introduction. While the pair became friends, their bond was then strengthened following the death of Troup in December of 2015, which Gunna has spoken extensively about.\n\n\u201cHe was like my uncle,\u201d Gunna told Billboard in 2018. \u201cTroup would always try to tell us, \u2018Get some money. Stay out of trouble.\u2019 He always tried to let us know there\u2019s more to this.\u201d\n\nAugust 26, 2016: Gunna Hops on Young Thug\u2019s \u201cFloyd Mayweather\u201d With Travis Scott and Gucci Mane\n\nYoung Thug officially introduced Gunna to the world in 2016 with the release of his album Jeffrey. On the album\u2019s second track \u201cFloyd Mayweather,\u201d Gunna dropped off his first official verse affiliated with YSL. Turns out, it was only the beginning.\n\n\u201cDo this s\u2014t all on my own, don\u2019t need no deal,\u201d Gunna and Thug spit simultaneously.\n\nWhile the timeline is a biz hazy, Gunna dropped off his debut Drip Season mixtape on YSL Records on October 14, 2016. Thugga appeared on the track \u201cCop Me a Foreign,\u201d and a few weeks later, Thug announced his newly founded record label. It\u2019s likely that Gunna and Thug spoke about this months before Drip Season\u2019s release, but Gunna wouldn\u2019t officially join the YSL roster for a few more months.\n\nAround February 2017, Gunna officially linked with YSL Records. From that point on, it was all hands on deck, as Gunna dropped off Drip Season 2 and his critically lauded Drip Harder mixtape with Lil Baby by 2018. Thug would of course be featured on both, on the songs \u201cSecure the Vibe\u201d and \u201cMy Jeans.\u201d Gunna\u2019s run would continue with 2020\u2019s WUNNA and 2022\u2019s DS4EVER as his career really started to take off.\n\nMay 9, 2022: Young Thug and Gunna Arrested as Part of YSL RICO Case\n\nIn May of 2022, Young Thug and 26 other YSL affiliates were arrested as part of the sprawling RICO Case against them. Thug of course faced the most charges, with police alleging he was the leader of a criminal \u201cgang\u201d masquerading as a record label. Wunna turned himself in two days later on May 11, and was charged with a single count of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. They were both denied bond on multiple occasions.\n\nGunna then accepted his much-discussed Alford plea deal in 2022. As the Young Thug and YSL RICO trial heated up, Gunna was among many of the early YSL affiliates to take a plea deal. His career took a big hit as a result, with allegations of Gunna being a rat spreading around all corners of the hip-hop landscape. The Drip or Drown rapper put out a statement via his lawyers denying this allegation, and claimed he at no point cooperated with law enforcement. Still, allegations of him being a \u201csnitch\u201d spread far and wide, and threatened to dampen his, at the time, spotless hip-hop career.\n\nThe situation was then made worse when court footage emerged showing Gunna answering \u201cyes\u201d to numerous key questions involving YSL, including that the label was allegedly a gang and that crimes were committed under the roster.\n\nSix months after striking his plea deal, Gunna returned with his comeback album, A Gift & a Curse. The featureless YSL Records release dropped on June 16 and included some subliminal shots aimed at the snitching allegations as a whole. The album was a surprising success despite the allegations, and in turn gave him a commercial hit record with \u201cfukumean.\u201d The song hit No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was inescapable on apps like TikTok.\n\nA week later, Thug himself returned with Business Is Business. Neither artist was featured on each other\u2019s projects, and throughout this run Gunna remained openly supportive of his still-incarcerated label head.\n\nMay 10, 2024: Gunna Drops Wun of One\n\nWhile dealing with subliminal insults from Lil Baby, Lil Durk and more over his snitching allegations, Gunna kept it pushing. He returned again with his Wun of One album in 2024. Thug was still in the midst of his high profile RICO Trial, so him and Gunna weren\u2019t in communication at all during this time. However, the album was also released via YSL Records.\n\nJune 24, 2024: Gunna Explains That He\u2019s Still on YSL Records\n\nIn a video interview with Spotify\u2019s RapCaviar, Gunna clarified after dropping Wun of One that he\u2019s \u201cstill signed to YSL.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still providing. We\u2019re still pushing,\u201d he said while sitting outside his mother\u2019s house. \u201cNo paperwork has been changed, you know what I\u2019m saying? So it\u2019s like, whatever\u2019s been getting and how we\u2019ve been pushing this s\u2013t, it\u2019s still going.\u201d\n\nAfter months of rampant criticism and speculation, YSL\u2019s co-founder YSL Mondo hopped on his Instagram Story to defend Gunna against the snitch allegations. In a lengthy post, Mondo said that \u201ctechnically he didn\u2019t rat,\u201d but added that Gunna, \u201cjust kinda folded under pressure and should\u2019ve just stayed down with his mans till everything was over.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke about 6ix9ine, who became a federal informant in a RICO case against the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, adding that 6ix9ine is a rat because he sent multiple people to jail. \u201cSaying Gunna was a rat is deadass wrong,\u201d Mondo concluded.\n\nOctober 31, 2024: Young Thug Is Free, Allowed to Maintain Contact With Gunna\n\nOn Halloween day 2024, Young Thug\u2019s lengthy RICO trial finally concluded, with the rapper being freed after entering a plea deal. The end result was 15 years of probation for Thugga, which also included stipulations surrounding who he could and could not contact at YSL. His lawyer Brian Steel asked the judge specifically if he could still work with Wunna and Thug\u2019s biological brother Unfoonk. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker approved both of these conditions, noting specifically that Gunna was contractually obligated to interact with Thug as a result of being on YSL.\n\nHowever in the year since, Thugga has done a few tweet and deletes that prove he has no plans to work with Gunna. The most direct one came as Gunna got ready to release The Last Wun earlier in 2025. \u201cGunna stop acting like we friends on the internet, I don\u2019t know u my guy,\u201d Thug wrote.\n\nWunna seemingly responded on the song \u201cprototype.\u201d \u201cN\u2014a had tweeted my name, must\u2019ve had to be a typo,\u201d Gunna spit.\n\nAfter a series of jail phone calls between Young Thug and his associates leaked online in September of 2025, one of the calls finally addressed Thugga\u2019s issues with Gunna.\n\n\u201cHe gave the jurors the agreement that it\u2019s a gang,\u201d Thugga said in part of a leaked call with 21 Savage. \u201cHe said, \u2018YSL is a gang\u2019 and he know people on this trial who committed crimes in furtherance of the gang\u2026 you don\u2019t know nobody on this case, that\u2019s a lie! That\u2019s a full blown lie. \u2018I know individuals on this case that committed crimes in furtherance of a gang\u2019\u2026 just so you could say slime did it? That\u2019s RICO.\u201d\n\nThug went on to say that because of Gunna\u2019s plea deal, he was the one who made it a RICO case.\n\u2022 None Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were 'Hangin' Tough' at No. 1\n\u2022 None H.E.R. & Chris Brown 'Come Through' to No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay Chart\n\nSign up for Billboard's Newsletter.

      "text": "Janet Jackson\u2019s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits\nHere's a look at the pop icon's history on the chart.\nAs Janet Jackson celebrates her birthday (May 16), Billboard takes a look at the singer\u2019s history on the Billboard Hot 100.\nBorn as the youngest of 10 children to Joseph and Katherine Jackson, Janet was almost pre-destined to enter the music industry with her brothers and sisters. By her fifth birthday, five of her brothers \u2014 as The Jackson 5 \u2014 had already scored four Hot 100 No. 1 hits. Following in her family\u2019s musical footsteps, Janet made her Hot 100 debut in 1982 with \u201cYoung Love,\u201d at 16 years old. Though that single and her second career entry, 1984\u2019s \u201cCome Give Your Love to Me,\u201d both peaked outside the top 50, Jackson found her hit-making stride with 1986\u2019s Control. Among its many hits, she landed her first of 10 No. 1s on the chart with \u201cWhen I Think of You,\u201d which reigned for two weeks.\nThrough the next 15 years, Jackson remained a Hot 100 force: Her next four albums, Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814, janet., The Velvet Rope and All for You, each all generated at least one Hot 100 champ. Thanks to her decades of hits, Jackson is one of the most influential female artists to cross through the pop, R&B and dance genres, with 19 and 15 No. 1s on the Dance Club Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts, respectively. She\u2019s also scored seven No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, between 1986 and 2015.\nJackson (who first broke through with TV roles on sitcoms Good Times and Diff\u2019rent Strokes) has won five Grammy Awards and has been nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award. She was honored as the first-ever MTV Icon Award recipient in 2001 and received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1990.\nHere\u2019s a look at the superstar\u2019s top-performing hits on the Hot 100.\nJanet Jackson\u2019s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits\n1. \u201cMiss You Much,\u201d peak position No. 1 (four weeks), peak date Oct. 7, 1989\n2. \u201cEscapade,\u201d No. 1 (three weeks), March 3, 1990\n3. \u201cThat\u2019s the Way Love Goes,\u201d No. 1 (eight weeks), May 15, 1993\n4. \u201cAll for You,\u201d No. 1 (seven weeks), April 14, 2001\n5. \u201cTogether Again,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks), Jan. 31, 1998\n6. \u201cLove Will Never Do (Without You),\u201d No. 1 (one week), Jan. 19, 1991\n7. \u201cWhen I Think of You,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks), Oct. 11, 1986\n8. \u201cAgain,\u201d No. 1 (two weeks) Dec. 11, 1993\n9. \u201cRunaway,\u201d No. 3, Oct. 21, 1995\n10. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Really Matter,\u201d No. 1 (three weeks), Aug. 26, 2000\n11. \u201cRhythm Nation,\u201d No. 2, Jan. 6, 1990\n12. \u201cAlright,\u201d No. 4, June 2, 1990\n13. \u201cControl,\u201d No. 5, Jan. 24, 1987\n14. \u201cWhat Have You Done for Me Lately,\u201d No. 4, May 17, 1986\n15. \u201cBlack Cat,\u201d No. 1 (one week), Oct. 27, 1990\n16. \u201cNasty,\u201d No. 3, July 19, 1986\n17. \u201cLet\u2019s Wait Awhile,\u201d No. 2, March 21, 1987\n18. \u201cCome Back to Me,\u201d No. 2, Aug. 18, 1990\n19. \u201cAny Time, Any Place\u201d/\u201dAnd On and On,\u201d No. 2, June 25, 1994\n20. \u201cIf,\u201d No. 4, Sept. 11, 1993\n21. \u201cWhat\u2019s It Gonna Be?!,\u201d (Busta Rhymes featuring Janet Jackson) No. 3, April 17, 1999\n22. \u201cSomeone to Call My Lover,\u201d No. 3, Sept. 1, 2001\n23. \u201cYou Want This\u201d/\u201c70\u2019s Love Groove,\u201d No. 8, Dec. 24, 1994\n24. \u201cI Get Lonely\u201d (Janet featuring BLACKstreet), No. 3, May 23, 1998\n25. \u201cScream\u201d/\u201cChildhood\u201d (with Michael Jackson), No. 5, June 17, 1995\nJanet Jackson\u2018s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 hits chart is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100, through the May 20, 2023, ranking.

      "text": "H.E.R. & Chris Brown \u2018Come Through\u2019 to No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay Chart\nThe new champ extends both H.E.R. and Brown's run of chart-topping success at the radio format.\nH.E.R. expands her dominance on Billboard\u2019s Adult R&B Airplay chart as \u201cCome Through,\u201d featuring Chris Brown, climbs to No. 1 on the list dated Jan. 1. The song advances from No. 3 \u2013 having previously reached No. 2 \u2013 despite a less than 1% gain in plays in the week ending Dec. 26, according to MRC Data, to become the most played song on U.S. monitored adult R&B stations. (The previous week\u2019s No. 1, Wizkid\u2019s \u201cEssence,\u201d featuring Tems, falls to No. 2 with a 9% decline in plays.)\n\u201cCome Through\u201d gives singer-songwriter H.E.R. a seventh No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay among 10 total career entries on the chart. With the new addition, here\u2019s her updated roster:\nSong Title, Artist (if other than H.E.R.), Weeks at No. 1, Date Reached No. 1\n\u201cFocus,\u201d one week, Oct. 6, 2018\n\u201cBest Part,\u201d Daniel Caesar featuring H.E.R., four, Oct. 20, 2018\n\u201cSlow Down,\u201d with Skip Marley, three, May 23, 2020\n\u201cMake the Most,\u201d Lonr. featuring H.E.R., one, Oct. 24, 2020\n\u201cGotta Move On,\u201d Toni Braxton featuring H.E.R., two, Feb. 20, 2021\n\u201cDamage,\u201d eight, June 26, 2021\n\u201cCome Through,\u201d featuring Chris Brown, Jan. 1, 2022\nIn addition, a seventh champ pushes H.E.R. into a tie for fourth place for the most No. 1s among all artists since the chart began in 1993. Check out the current leaderboard:\n12, Alicia Keys\n11, Toni Braxton\n8, Charlie Wilson\n7, H.E.R.\n7, Kem\n7, Maxwell\n7, R. Kelly\nFor Chris Brown, meanwhile, \u201cCome Through\u201d sustains his Adult R&B Airplay success streak with a third consecutive leader. The single follows his two other champs, \u201cNo Guidance,\u201d featuring Drake, an 11-week No. 1 in 2020 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d with Young Thug, which reigned for seven weeks in 2020-21.\n\u201cCome Through\u201d continues the newfound radio breakthrough for Brown with adult R&B audiences. After some success with his initial 14 chart appearances from 2006-16, the hitmaker has grown into a favorite of adult R&B radio programmers and audiences in recent years. In 2019, he found his first top five success on his 15th try, with \u201cUndecided\u201d reaching No. 4 before the three No. 1s streak.\n\u201cCome Through\u201d appears on H.E.R.\u2019s debut full-length studio album, Back of My Mind. The set, released in June, debuted at No. 1 on Top R&B Albums and led for one week."

      "text": "Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were \u2018Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2019 at No. 1\nThe Boston boy band topped the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 with its breakthrough album and the set's title cut, respectively.\nIn every era of pop music, boy bands have elicited irrepressible shrieks from adoring fans. In the \u201960s, it was the Beatles. In the \u201970s, the Jackson 5. More recently, the likes of Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, who then passed the boy band baton to One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer.\nIn 1989, it was New Kids on the Block\u2018s turn to rule music like only boy bands can.\nAfter Boston-based producer-songwriter Maurice Starr had formed New Edition, which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985 with \u201cCool It Now,\u201d he followed with New Kids on the Block \u2013 brothers Jonathan and Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood. While their self-titled first LP didn\u2019t hit the Billboard 200 upon its release, follow-up Hangin\u2019 Tough filled the late-\u201980s boy band void, yielding five infectious Hot 100 top 10s, including the quintet\u2019s first No. 1 in June 1989, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Loving You (Forever).\u201d The ballad followed the No. 10-peaking \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Go Girl\u201d and the No. 3 hit \u201cYou Got It (The Right Stuff),\u201d which built even more buzz.\nOn Sept. 9, 1989, New Kids\u2019 rise culminated in the set and its title track taking over atop the Billboard 200 and Hot 100, respectively. The set was a slow-burner that took 55 weeks to reach the Billboard 200 summit, completing one of the longest climbs to No. 1 in the chart\u2019s history.\nBy years\u2019 end, New Kids on the Block had charted at last on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 25, and generated its own top 10, the group\u2019s No. 8 cover of the Delfonics\u2019 \u201cDidn\u2019t I (Blow Your Mind).\u201d The group even gleaned a top 10 from a third album, the holiday set Merry, Merry Christmas, when \u201cThis One\u2019s for the Children\u201d reached No. 7. In between, Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2018s fifth single \u201cCover Girl\u201d rose to No. 2.\n(On their summer 1989 tour, New Kids on the Block \u2013 and former Billboard publisher Tommy Page, then in his teen-idol days [he passed in 2017] \u2013 set out as the opening acts for Tiffany. By the end of the tour, Tiffany and New Kids had swapped spots.)\nThe Kids\u2019 blend of street (i.e., Wahlberg\u2019s semi-rap on \u201cHangin\u2019 Tough\u201d) and sweet (Jordan Knight and McIntyre served as the voices of the band\u2019s biggest ballads) helped make them a chart, touring and merchandise powerhouse, one that continued with 1990\u2019s Step by Step. Like its predecessor, the album and its title song became respective Billboard 200 and Hot 100 No. 1s. Follow-up single \u201cTonight,\u201d which playfully name-checks several of the act\u2019s earlier hits, rose to No. 7.\nUltimately, the group earned the honor of Billboard\u2018s top artist of both 1989 and 1990.\nAs musical trends shifted from pure-pop to rap and grunge, New Kids on the Block released the No. 37-peaking Face the Music (billed as NKOTB) in 1994 before taking a hiatus. With enough time passed for nostalgia to help restore its image (along with a return to prominence for pop music), the band blew back in 2008 with the No. 2 hit album The Block (featuring a track with then-new act Lady Gaga), which yielded the quintet\u2019s first top 40 Hot 100 hit since 1992, the No. 36-peaking \u201cSummertime.\u201d Its 2013 album 10 hit No. 6. In between, the act embraced its place in boy band lineage: In 2011, it released NKOTBSB, a collaborative set with Backstreet Boys, which hit No. 7. The acts\u2019 partnership continued in the form of Nick & Knight, aka BSB\u2019s Nick Carter and New Kid Jordan, in 2014.\nMost recently, New Kids on the Block released the album Still Kids, which launched at No. 4 on the Top Album Sales chart in June. Lead single \u201cKids\u201d has hit both the Adult Pop Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, marking the group\u2019s first appearance on the latter list in nearly 35 years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of not wanting to let each other down,\u201d Wahlberg said when the group chatted with Billboard in New York in May. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency that I think you can sometimes hear in the voices, of wanting to deliver the best of a performance. I think that\u2019s present in this record, even in the writing.\u201d"

      "text": "Gunna generally plays it cool, slithering through performances and videos with an icy calm that matches the downbeat, melodic vibe of so much of his music. But in October, onstage at the BET Awards, performing his top 5 hit, \u201cDrip So Hard,\u201d alongside his partner-in-crime, Lil Baby, he let his mask drop for a moment and broke out in a toothy grin. He didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but the moment was a real landmark for the young Atlanta rapper.\n\u201cWhen I seen myself on TV, it made me realize, \u2018You\u2019re doing what you really wanted to do,\u2019\u201d he tells Billboard. \u201c\u2019You\u2019re living out your dreams.\u2019\u201d\nTrending on Billboard\nGunna was born Sergio Kitchens and grew up in College Park, on the southside of Atlanta, where his mom worked in the cafeteria at his elementary school. \u201cI didn\u2019t have life that good coming up,\u201d the 25-year old rapper says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born with a lot of money. We weren\u2019t dirt poor but we weren\u2019t rich. All I knew was struggle. My family taught me about saving and how to stretch to make ends meet.\u201d\nDespite growing up in Atlanta, the music he cites as his first love actually came from New Orleans: Lil Wayne, the Hot Boys and Master P\u2018s No Limit Records. He was barely a teenager when he first started recording. \u201cWhen I was 13, I went to the studio with some neighborhood friends. It was a studio in my friend\u2019s garage.\u201d The first song he ever wrote was called \u201cSwag So Cool,\u201d but for a long time, he was just another kid with dreams of hip-hop stardom.\nAn older head in the neighborhood named Keith \u201cKing\u201d Troup became a mentor. \u201cHe was like my uncle,\u201d says Gunna. \u201cTroup would always try to tell us, \u2018Get some money. Stay out of trouble.\u2019 He always tried to let us know there\u2019s more to this. He used to always be with people who were already doing good, like Allen Iverson. When Iverson was playing basketball, he used to come to Old National [Highway] with Troup.\u201d\nIn 2015, Troup invited Gunna out to a video shoot for Young Thug\u2018s track, \u201cWith That,\u201d which was being filmed on Atlanta\u2019s south side. \u201cThat was my first time meeting Thug,\u201d says Gunna. \u201cWe didn\u2019t exchange numbers or nothing like that. We were just cool whenever we would see each other.\u201d But when Troup was shot 14 times and killed at a gas station on Old National Highway in late 2015, it changed the relationship between Thug and Gunna. \u201cWe went to the funeral together and that brought us closer,\u201d he says.\nThug was key in introducing Gunna to the wider public, showcasing his nimble, yearning flow on Thug\u2019s 2016 track \u201cFloyd Mayweather,\u201d and featuring on the three Drip Season mixtapes Gunna has released each of the past three years. \u201cThug\u2019s just a real good dude. He helped me out a lot to perfect my craft.\u201d\nHanging out in the studio with Thug, Gunna met another key collaborator, Lil Baby. Their 2018 joint mixtape Drip Harder has brought comparisons to Rich Gang and Outkast, and has spawned the biggest hits of Gunna\u2019s career: \u201cNever Recover,\u201d a moody creeper that features a verse from Drake, reached No. 9 on the rap charts, and the intoxicating \u201cDrip Too Hard,\u201d which hit No. 4 on the Hot 100. \u201cAt first, Baby wasn\u2019t even a rapper,\u201d says Gunna. \u201cWe just started hanging with each other because we had mutual friends.\u201d After Quality Control honchos Coach K and Pee convinced Baby to try his hand at music in 2017, he and Gunna just clicked. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of the same,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re both young, from Atlanta, we like the same things, so when we get in the studio we just feed off each other.\u201d\nGunna doesn\u2019t claim to have invented the word \u201cdrip\u201d but beginning with his first full-length mixtape, 2016\u2019s Drip Season, he has clearly made it his brand. \u201cDrip is just another word for swag,\u201d he explains. \u201cSwag was not our word \u2014 my era is drip, that\u2019s our swag.\u201d Fashion is an important part of Gunna\u2019s creative mojo and he often slips brand names into his lyrics. \u201cIt goes together, clothes and music. A lot of artists can really rap but don\u2019t have the image. You\u2019ll never go without an image. You\u2019ve got to have an image for the words.\u201d\nGunna has plans to one day design his own fashion line, but for right now, his future is musical. He has a feature on the new Mariah Carey album (\u201cStay Long Love You\u201d) and his next release, Drip or Drown 2, is already finished. He\u2019s been touring with Travis Scott but still recording nearly every day. \u201cI got a studio on the bus,\u201d he says, explaining that he records on off-days or right after shows. But still, he recognizes that being hot at the moment doesn\u2019t guarantee a long career. \u201cThat comes with staying humble, staying in the studio, making more music and not feeling like I\u2019m done, like I already did it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m still working.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared in the Dec. 8 issue of Billboard."

The OVO boss admitted they got into a \u201ctiff,\u201d which resulted in them pulling the interview altogether after Althoff attended an It\u2019s All A Blur Tour show in Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou made me feel like our interview was the reason your life was bad,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just said I\u2019m gonna get rid of the interview and you won\u2019t ever have to see it again a day in your life.\u201d\nDrake also addressed the allegations of him having cosmetic surgery on his abs, as fans peppered him with ab sculpting speculation following a shirtless selfie he posted to Instagram in June.\nTrending on Billboard\n\u201cNo,\u201d he bluntly replied when asked about ever having ab surgery to get a six-pack. He then joked about Metro Boomin trolling him with the \u201cBBL Drizzy\u201d diss, but admitted he may have edited the special effects and filter surrounding the photo using an app.\n\u201cI think it was just like I came from the gym. I was sweaty in that pic,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I like heightened the saturation or something on it. I hit it too hard. They don\u2019t look like that. You saw them.\u201d\nOutside of Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross was another artist feuding with Drake last year, and Drizzy sniped back during the interview, calling out Rozay for having fake jewelry with a jab that went over Althoff\u2019s head.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen someone ice Ros\u00e9? Well, talk to every jeweler in Miami that has fake diamonds,\u201d he quipped.\nThroughout their chat, Drake also reflected on being arrested in Sweden for nine hours, why he feels his first interview with Bobbi paved the way for rappers to connect more easily with streamers and WWE diva Rhea Ripley, his current muse filling up his Instagram For You page.\nWatch the full interview below."

After Gunna\u2019s plea deal and accusations of snitching, the duo severed ties, with both artists releasing solo projects without collaboration. Leaked phone calls in 2025 confirmed Thug\u2019s claims that Gunna cooperated with prosecutors, deepening the rift. The feud has persisted despite Gunna\u2019s continued YSL affiliation and Thug\u2019s release from prison, with both artists publicly distancing themselves.
