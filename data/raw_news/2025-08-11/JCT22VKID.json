      "text": "The sixth developer beta of iOS 26 has arrived, and it introduces an onboarding sequence, along with six additional iPhone ringtones. Here's what's new.\nOn Monday, a week after the debut of the fifth developer beta, Apple released iOS 26 developer beta 6. The update increments the build number to 23A5318c, up from the previous 23A5308g.\nAs a whole, the iOS 26 update introduced a variety of meaningful upgrades, including improvements to Image Playground, Shortcuts, and new features for the Messages and Phone apps.\nAlong with a dedicated Games app, Apple unveiled a Foundation Models framework that lets developers utilize Apple Intelligence tools in third-party apps, while Visual Intelligence now supports screenshots. Some of these enhancements are ideal for creative work on iPhone, while others are arguably better for business users.\nStill, iOS 26 is largely known for its controversial \"Liquid Glass\" design language, which is used across all of the company's platforms. The software features dynamic user interface elements that mimic the look of real-world glass, replacing the flat aesthetic used from iOS 7 through iOS 18.\nThe sixth developer beta of iOS 26 builds upon the design choices introduced in prior releases through updates to animations and UI elements. There's even a new sequence detailing the most noteworthy changes of iOS 26.\nNew intro sequence and improved app animations\nMonday's developer beta features an entirely new onboarding sequence. Through a series of animated splash screens, Apple details the key changes within iOS 26, namely its \"Liquid Glass\" design language.\nThe macOS Tahoe beta got a similar onboarding video, along with an updated splash screen for the Photos app.\nThe intro sequence highlights the customization options of iOS 26, as well as the dynamic user interface elements that were introduced as part of the \"Liquid Glass\" redesign. Apple also emphasizes how iOS 26 makes searching within apps significantly easier through UI changes.\nWith iOS 26 developer beta 6, Apple altered the animations used when applications are launched. The new animations are imperceptibly faster, and they now feature a genie-type effect, making them somewhat reminiscent of iPadOS.\nApple also fixed the way priority notifications are displayed, eliminating a cutoff bug that was present in earlier developer betas of iOS 26.\nThe Lock Screen clock, meanwhile, has received an improved \"Liquid Glass\" effect, more closely resembling what Apple previewed during WWDC 2025. Some of the changes in iOS 26 beta 6, however, have more to do with sounds rather than imagery.\nMore ringtones, removed Camera toggle\nBy opening the Settings app and navigating to Sounds & Haptics > Ringtone, you'll see six new options under the \"Reflection\" ringtone. The melodies offer different takes on the existing Reflection ringtone, and they're no less recognizable than the original, which is still the default iPhone ringtone.\nThe different \"Reflection\" ringtone variants in iOS 26 developer beta 6 are labeled as follows:\n- Default\n- Buoyant\n- Dreamer\n- Pond\n- Pop\n- Reflected\n- Surge\nThe iOS 26 update itself also makes it much easier to add custom iPhone ringtones. The company's decision to include a new ringtone variant goes well with its improved customization options. Apple first added an alternate version of its \"Reflections\" ringtone with the second developer beta of iOS 26.\niOS 26 developer beta 6, meanwhile, removed a toggle for the Camera app that was added in the previous beta. The fifth developer beta featured a \"Camera Mode Switching\" toggle that let users swipe through camera modes like they did with prior iOS releases, disabling the navigation method implemented with iOS 26.\nWith iOS 18, for instance, users were able to swipe through camera modes as though they were interacting with a dial. iOS 26, meanwhile, replaced this with a loupe-type element that's arguably more clunky. Unfortunately, Apple has now made it impossible to revert to the previous method of navigation without downgrading to iOS 18.\nOverall, iOS 26 developer beta 6 offers a few new ringtones, but not much else beyond quality-of-life improvements. Apple deploys new developer betas of iOS nearly every week or two, meaning that we'll likely see additional features and changes with subsequent software releases."

      "text": "WWDC\nAll about WWDC\nTable of Contents\nWWDC is an Apple event that takes place over five days, with the keynote address on the first day. The keynote has become increasingly popular among non-developers due to the presentation and the hype it generates.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple would invite thousands of developers to attend the conference in person. Attendees would fill the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus to catch a glimpse of the future and get a chance to interact with Apple engineers face-to-face.\nAfter the threat of the pandemic was understood, Apple pivoted to a digital-only conference in 2020. The keynote presentation was filled with panning drone shots, high-quality editing, and fast-moving segments. All sessions and other keynotes were digital as well, with sessions taking place via Webex video chats.\nThe 2021 WWDC was digital-only as well due to the ongoing pandemic. With the shift back to normalcy in 2022, Apple relied on a hybrid approach.\nAt each WWDC, Apple unveils its latest operating system updates, software changes, and Apple Intelligence upgrades. Though the conference is meant to be dedicated to developers, Apple sometimes sneaks in hardware or service updates as well.\nUpdates are expected for the following operating systems:\nThe following developer tools are also usually updated:\nThe keynote address isn't able to reveal every change and update to all of Apple's platforms, so the remainder of the week is dedicated to sessions. These sessions cover all the new features and documentation surrounding what updates developers will need to perform before the software's fall release.\nApple has been known to announce some details ahead of WWDC to keep the conference focused on developers. The keynote is often packed to the brim with software details, so some hardware features or service updates are announced via a press release before the event.\nThe company has diverted from its usual announcement cycle to reveal hardware or services during a WWDC keynote before. Some notable exceptions included Apple Music in 2015, HomePod in 2017, the M2 MacBook Air in 2022, and Apple Vision Pro in 2023.\nWWDC 2025\nJune 9, 2025\nThe biggest redesign since iOS 7 was revealed during WWDC 25, and along with it, every OS was renamed to have version number 26. The Liquid Glass design opened up a lot of new tweaks and changes across the ecosystem.\nApple Intelligence didn't get any real upgrades in capability, but new features were added. Live Translation appears in Messages, FaceTime, and the Music app, while Image Playground has a ChatGPT option.\nOperating systems expected:\nNo hardware was announced, so no Apple Vision Pro updates or Mac Pro with M3 Ultra. Apple Intelligence took a back seat, and there was almost no mention of Apple's work on the app intent-based Siri.\niOS and iPadOS saw some of the biggest changes across the ecosystem. iPadOS has a new multitasking system that adds a Menu Bar and traffic lights, while iOS gained more functionality in several apps.\nWWDC 2024\nJune 10, 2024\nApple held WWDC 2024 to announce the usual range of operating system updates. But instead of surprising with new hardware, the company finally unveiled its plans for Apple Intelligence.\nThe trend of adding new customization options to iOS and iPadOS continued, while Apple meshed some app features together as well. Despite AI catching everyone's attention, it was still a feature-filled set of OS updates.\nOperating systems announced:\nSome expected an M3 Ultra and updates to the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, but that didn't happen. It seems Apple will skip M3 Ultra and wait for M4 Ultra in 2025.\nApple Intelligence focused on local models that run on-device, but can call out to a Private Cloud Compute server run by Apple if more power is needed. Users will benefit from a more intelligent Siri, Writing Tools, and Image Playground.\nWWDC 2023\nJune 5-9\nApple continued its trend of announcing social and customization features across its operating systems. A few surprises were also revealed, like the Apple Vision Pro and the Mac Pro with Apple Silicon.\nOperating system releases\nRumors had suggested 2023 would be a quiet year for software, but Apple pushed back on that notion with interactive widgets on iOS, a redesigned watchOS, and an all-new platform called visionOS. Developers are in for a busy summer as they prepare for spatial computing.\nWWDC 2022\nJune 6-10\nThis hybrid in-person and digital event focused on customization in iOS and developer APIs. Stage Manager stole the conversation as a new multitasking feature for iPad and Mac.\nUpdates announced\nApple also announced the M2 processor and M2 MacBook Air during the keynote. This was a surprise, as the M1 still hadn't arrived in the Mac Pro and never would.\nWWDC 2021\nJune 7-11\nThis digital-only event focused on social features and privacy. Cross-platform features were also enhanced thanks to Universal Control and SharePlay.\nUpdates announced\nApple also introduced Focus Mode, a feature that replaces Do Not Disturb with refined controls over what notifies you when. Other improvements include bringing Shortcuts to macOS and free widget placement in iPadOS.\nWWDC 2020\nJune 22-26\nThe ongoing pandemic created a lot of uncertainty going into June 2020, but Apple managed to come out swinging with a high-quality pre-recorded event. Since many of the features are worked on over the previous year, Apple didn't have any time to prep for work-from-home-focused releases.\nUpdates announced\n- iOS 14\n- iPadOS 14\n- macOS Big Sur\n- watchOS 7\n- tvOS 14\nApple continued the trend of pushing more iOS-like features to the Mac and unveiled App Tracking Transparency. Now, apps must notify users when they are going to track them, what data is collected, and how it is used.\nMost importantly, Apple announced it would transition the Mac to custom Apple Silicon, away from Intel. The transition would take two years at most and bring ARM to the Mac.\nWWDC 2019\nJune 3-7\nThere were some surprises outside of the usual operating system updates during the 2019 developer conference. Apple revealed iPadOS, the new operating system for the iPad that takes advantage of the larger display. It also shared a preview of the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, a top-end Mac for professionals that would debut later in the year.\nUpdates announced\n- iOS 13\n- iPadOS 13\n- macOS Catalina\n- watchOS 7\n- tvOS 14\nOther new features included SideCar, which enables using iPads as an external display for the Mac. Also, Apple Watch gained menstrual cycle tracking."

      "text": "iOS 26\nAll about iOS 26\nTable of Contents\nApple has redesigned its entire ecosystem and unified the naming based on the year. So, now we have iOS 26 with a Liquid Glass design that makes everything reflective and bubbly in an attempt to emulate visionOS.\nThe redesign was spread across the ecosystem, but iOS 26 was impacted the most. The Home Screen, Control Center, and other aspects show off the design almost constantly.\nThere were a lot of smaller announcements, especially around app functionality. Apple has spent the last several WWDCs focusing on features that promote communication and customization, and 2025 was no different.\niOS 26 design\nThat new design changes a lot of how iOS looks and feels, but you'll still see a Lock Screen, swipe up to view a Home Screen, and swipe over to see the App Library. Imagine it's like replacing a brick building with an identical one made of glass \u2014 the core layout is the same, but how it looks affects how it works to an extent.\nMany of the modals, menus, and toolbars were rethought to ensure that controls are always near where you last tapped. They've got a sleek new glassy layer, but the buttons work the same.\nThe redesign yielded some interesting interaction changes as well, like how the Safari address bar shrinks when scrolling. There's also a lot more disappearing elements that gets out of the way intelligently.\nApple has been changing how much the Liquid Glass material is used across the ecosystem during the betas. It is still applied quite heavily in some areas, but others have been adjusted to help with legibility.\nBeyond the iOS 26 redesign, there are plenty of new features across the system.\niOS 26 features\nApple didn't introduce a redesign and stop the keynote. There are several updates, including new Apple Intelligence features, changes to Messages, and a new Apple Games app.\nOne of the more useful features revealed during the keynote is the two new call features.\nCall Screening will automatically answer unknown numbers and ask for their information before ringing the phone and showing the user a transcript. That gives the user a chance to determine if the call is legitimate or spam before accepting or declining.\nAnother call feature is Hold Assist. It allows users to essentially \"hang up\" when put on hold while the call remains active and the user is notified when a human operator picks up the phone.\nA new app coming to iPhone, iPad, and Mac with the OS 26 releases is the Games app. It acts as a central hub for launching games, discovery, and social features for games.\nUsers can easily launch the Games app by pressing the \"Home\" button on any connected controller \u2014 as long as that button isn't already mapped like on the Backbone One. It can also be launched using an automation and Game Focus.\nApple designed the Games app to work in portrait or landscape so it could easily be navigated with a controller. Connect with friends, view achievements, join multiplayer games, and create new challenges all within the app.\nSome feature highlights in iOS 26:\n- Updated Phone app with unified layout\n- Call Screening helps prevent inadvertently answering spam calls\n- Hold Assist lets users put away their phone until an agent is available\n- Messages gets new filters with spam screening\n- Live Translation across the system, like in Messages, FaceTime, and Apple Music\n- Apple Intelligence comes to Shortcuts\n- Visual Intelligence is part of the screenshot tool\n- Image Playground and Genmoji get new styles and ChatGPT support\n- Apple Intelligence seeks out package tracking in Mail to add to Wallet\n- Reminders gains Apple Intelligence suggestions and sorting\n- CarPlay is updated with the Liquid Glass design\n- Apple Games app adds discovery and social tools to one central location\n- Safari is redesigned with a floating, rounded tab layout\n- Messages gains backgrounds, polls, and group chat typing indicators\n- Users can create multiple journals in the Journal app\n- Photos gets more customization, new tab design with Liquid Glass\n- FaceTime gets a new landing page with Contact Posters\n- Notes gains import and export of Markdown files\n- Passwords gets a history view to access old passwords\niPhone users have had increased anxiety over battery life and health ever since the so-called batterygate situation with old batteries and peak power throttling in iOS 10. Apple has answered this anxiety with a comprehensive battery management system within Settings that has been upgraded on a regular basis.\nThe latest updates include a new \"time to 80%\" indicator on the Lock Screen above the clock and a new adaptive power setting. The adaptive power mode uses additional optimizations to manage charging and features like Low Power Mode in relation to how the device is used.\nThe WWDC keynote has barely concluded, and there are a lot of details to uncover about all of Apple's latest operating systems. Stay tuned for more details on this page for iOS 26.\nEverything below this point has been preserved for historical purposes. It was written before WWDC 2025 and addresses the rumors and expectations around the new iOS update.\nNo, iOS 26 isn't an operating system Apple will announce in seven years, it is potentially the new name for what's being announced in 2025. The naming convention change is going to apply across the board, so iPadOS 26, macOS 26, visionOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26.\nIf you've been keeping up with rumors about iOS 19, this is that same OS update. Apple is still expected to reveal a redesigned ecosystem around the visionOS paradigm, more AI tools, and new features to match.\nSo yes, that video above covering iOS 19 is still accurate if you swap every mention of iOS 19 for iOS 26. We'll get into the rumors for this operating system in a moment, but first, let's dive into Apple's naming conventions.\niOS 26: what's in a name?\nOf course, it fundamentally doesn't matter what Apple calls its next iOS release. In fact, it doesn't really need to call it anything publicly other than \"iOS.\"\nThe number slapped onto the end of the operating system name serves a purpose distinguishing between releases, but Apple turned it into a piece of marketing. However, it never seemed to stick, and iPhone users barely recognized that they were running something called iOS, let alone which number it was.\nCurrent operating system versions:\nThere is a need for versioning, but with annual releases, it makes sense to address each operating system by a year. Though, there is some question behind Apple's reasoning behind calling it iOS 26 in 2025, and the answer is still tied to marketing.\nWhen car manufacturers announce their new vehicles in the first half of the year, they don't call them by the year they are announced. That's because by the time the vehicle launches to the masses, there's very little time left in the year, and once the calendar year rolls over, that car now sounds outdated.\nThe same thinking can be applied to the iOS 26 naming convention. It will release to the public about a week before October 2025, so that leaves only three months of the year it'll be the \"wrong year,\" followed by nine months of iOS 26 being the current release in 2026.\nAnother marketing angle could be applied to how Apple releases updates to the public. The initial launch of iOS 26 will show up as an optional update for a few weeks, then shift to being the only one available as iOS 18 is phased out.\nIn 2026, when users are on iOS 26, the iOS 27 release will be shown as an optional update as well. In that case, it'll appear more like you're getting access to a future version of iOS early and could help drive adoption.\nRegardless, it's still the same operating system with the same design and features. The naming convention shift aligns with the rumored redesign, so it makes sense for Apple to pull the trigger now.\niOS 26 redesign\nRumors indicate that Apple will be performing a significant redesign across its ecosystem to better unify the look and feel of its software. The unification is said to be around visionOS, which has a transparent, glassy, bubbly look compared to the other operating systems.\nEarly leaks around the redesign have been called insufficient. Mockups showed glossy elements with edge-lit glass-like textures in some apps and on Home Screen icons, but the rest of the system seemed relatively unchanged.\nIf Apple's redesign is as significant as rumors seem to suggest, it'll be one of the biggest redesigns since the move away from skeuomorphism with iOS 7. Love it or hate it, Apple seems set on making visionOS the future of its ecosystem.\nThe redesign isn't limited to iOS 26 either. It is expected to affect the design, to some extent, across every operating system.\nThe Home Screen could be where one of the biggest changes occurs, since Apple's squircle icons are, well, iconic. Apple Vision Pro has a Home View with circular icons, but apparently Apple isn't going that far. Instead, the icons will be slightly more rounded, but still squircle in shape.\nOther renders show various menus and buttons with shiny, glassy textures that likely reflect light based on the device\u2019s accelerometer. Menus and modal windows also take on a more transparent design as well.\nApple Intelligence in iOS 26\nApple Intelligence could take a back seat during WWDC 2025. Some rumors even suggest that Apple could put off announcing new features for its AI initiative until later in the year while focusing on OS updates.\nHowever, given the scrutiny on Apple for how it has handled its AI rollout so far, it seems highly unlikely that the keynote will go by without making it a central focus of its strategy.\nNearly every feature announced for iOS 18 was released in 2024 and early 2025, except perhaps the most important one. The new app intents system that provides on-screen and contextual data to Apple Intelligence and Siri was going to supercharge Apple's on-device AI efforts, but it never arrived.\nApple seemingly had to push the feature back to iOS 26 in order to try and account for hallucinations related to using LLM-based technology. If Apple was going to pull off such a feature, the error rate had to be slim, if not none.\nDevelopers have been able to target the app intents since iOS 18.2, so there could be broad support baked in by the time the feature rolls out. It is expected that Apple will show off the feature again during WWDC 2025 and release it in the fall.\nAnother rumor around Apple's AI efforts centers around developer APIs. Right now, developers can implement parts of Apple's tools into their apps, like Image Playground or Writing Tools, but they can't utilize the models themselves for custom features.\nThat could change in iOS 26. The combination of access to on-device models and contextually aware Apple Intelligence could help Apple leapfrog back into the AI race. It is the only company building the technology with privacy and security in mind, which could give it an advantage.\nApple Health AI\nOne of Apple's new Apple Intelligence features could be an \"AI doctor\" that lives in Apple Health. While the rumor calls it a doctor, it will likely be closer to what you'd call a health coach for regulatory purposes.\nThe Apple Health app is a massive repository for data that isn't exactly human-parseable. Sure, it has the ability to show trends and recent data, but it's not all that useful unless you know what to look for.\nInstead, Apple's AI tool could allow users to ask questions about their data or have conversations about their health choices. The Apple Health AI would be able to better correlate and explain items, like less sleep occurring when alcohol is consumed or weight gain after too many sodas.\nThe feature could also tie into Apple's Fitness+ program by connecting health data points to fitness plans. If a user\u2019s age, weight, medication, diet, sleep, and more can be taken into account, it could mean getting much more personalized workout recommendations.\nRebooting Siri as an LLM\nApple is rumored to be working on rebuilding Siri's backend to be run by an LLM instead of more basic machine learning. It could mean having an advanced AI chatbot built into the operating system that goes way beyond simple commands and questions.\nBasically, take every rumored feature of Apple Intelligence and roll it in with an on-device assistant capable of taking advantage of it all. It would mean a significant upgrade to Siri and its capabilities.\nThe LLM-based Siri with access to what's being shown on the display, donated data via the app intent system, and other on-device data would be highly tuned into the user and its needs. A lot of the potential functionality depends on how well Apple can execute on AI the second time around.\nSuch a significant overhaul won't be simple. Rumors place it at iOS 26.4 before becoming available. That is if it even makes it to iOS 26.\nWith feature delays already plaguing iOS 18, there's going to be a difficult road ahead for Apple's AI plans. However, changes in leadership around AI and Siri may help push things forward.\niOS 26 accessibility updates\nApple has made it a habit to announce accessibility features for upcoming operating systems ahead of WWDC. There's nothing here hinting at an operating system redesign, but there are a lot of great quality-of-life updates for users that need them.\nThe new features include:\n- Accessibility Nutrition Labels on the App Store\n- Magnifier for Mac\n- Braille Access\n- Accessibility Reader\n- Live captions on Apple Watch\n- Live Recognition in Apple Vision Pro\nAccessibility Nutrition Labels give users an overview of what features are compatible with a given app in the App Store. It could help push some apps to adopt features in order to help promote them as accessible apps.\nBraille access is a big update, bringing support for Braille across the system like taking notes or transcribing conversations. Braille Access also works as an app launcher and Braille Ready Format file support.\nAccessibility Reader lets users adjust font size, color, spacing, and other settings. It is available within any app, including the Magnifier app.\nMore features are coming to Apple Watch and Apple Vision Pro as well. Plus, Apple plans to update existing features.\n- Eye Tracking on iPhone and iPad\n- Head Tracking to control devices with head movements\n- Switch Control for Brain Computer Interfaces\n- Assistive Access for the Apple TV app\n- Customizable Music Haptics on iPhone\n- Sound Recognition gains Name Recognition\n- Voice Control for Xcode\n- New languages in Live Captions\n- Large Text in CarPlay\nThe features are expected as a part of iOS, macOS, visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS in 2025. They could arrive in the initial release or in a point one or two update before the end of 2025.\niOS 26 release date\nApple is expected to release iOS 26 to the public in September 2025 after the iPhone 17 lineup is revealed. The beta for iOS 26 will begin in June immediately after the WWDC keynote.\nEvery device that supports iOS 18 is expected to maintain support for iOS 26. Those are:\n- iPhone 17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max (2025)\n- iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, 16 Pro Max (2024)\n- iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max (2023)\n- iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max, iPhone SE (3rd gen) (2022)\n- iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max (2021)\n- iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, iPhone SE (2nd gen) (2020)\n- iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max (2019)\n- iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR (2018)"

Manufacturing iPhone in the United States\n- 4. Learn more about iPhone\nWhen Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, it was meant to be a crossroads between communication, technology, and design. After a few years of ramping up the supply chain and gaining popularity, the iPhone began to dominate the smartphone market.\nSince the iPhone 4, no other device line has penetrated the market in the same way. Despite concerns from analysts that Apple was becoming too reliant on the iPhone, the company pivoted to services and software sales that fed off the increasing install base.\nHaving one central device act as a magnet to other portions of a company's business has been referred to as the \"halo effect,\" and this phenomenon plays a vital role in the Apple ecosystem.\niPhone Features\nThe basic slab-of-glass-and-aluminum design hasn't changed much over the lifetime of the iPhone. Interaction paradigms have shifted, and Apple has moved from Touch ID to Face ID, but overall the concept of a piece of glass displaying relevant information has remained constant.\nApple developed specialized software specifically for the iPhone and touch interfaces called iOS. The operating system shares many elements with its macOS cousin but focuses on a touch-only interface. As of iOS 13, Apple branched the OS into two different forks, iOS and iPadOS, to address hardware-specific features more directly.\nApps\nThe App Store operates as the sole storefront for software on iOS devices. Apple does not allow users to side-load apps from the web or use other app stores on iOS.\nMany anti-trust investigations surrounding the App Store and how business is conducted have shown no evidence of a rigged system or monopoly. Even so, some companies like Microsoft or third-party developers still call for investigations into Apple's business practices.\nAll apps and subscriptions sold in the App Store are subject to a 30% service fee on Apple Platforms. Subscriptions that retain a subscriber for over a year are only charged 15%.\nApple pre-loads every iPhone sold with several default apps, and they are all first-party apps. Once users finish the onboarding process on a new iPhone, they can go to the App Store and download free and paid apps via their Apple ID.\nApp updates are free, but some features may be locked behind paywalls called in-app purchases or IAP. Some apps charge a subscription fee instead of IAP, which will unlock features once a user subscribes.\nThe App Store makes most of the profits in the mobile app market despite having a smaller user base than Google Play.\nCamera\nThe smartphone camera was a relatively new concept when the iPhone was released in 2007. Since then, Apple has used its expertise in tying hardware and software together to produce industry-leading mobile photography engines that fit in your pocket.\nApple releases new photography-focused features with each new hardware or OS release, as consumers have shown that to be a high priority for new-device purchases.\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and newer can shoot 48MP photos using the ProRAW format to capture large and detailed photos. It is also capable of recording ProRES video in 4K.\nComputational photography has only improved in recent generations. For iPhone 16, Apple now offers reversible Photographic Styles that basically enable the user to apply styles and reprocess a photo as if it were freshly captured.\nLive Photos\nThe iPhone will capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after the camera shutter is pressed. This produces a playable video with sound to show off the events surrounding the image capture. When editing Live photos, users can select which frame is shown as the still, and all edits made to the still photo are applied to the entire Live Photo.\nSwiping up on a live photo within the Photos app will let users change the still image into a looping GIF or a long exposure. These changes show up as live tiles within the day-view of the Photos app.\nPortrait Mode\nWhen using Portrait mode, the iPhone will utilize multiple cameras to determine the depth map of what is being photographed, then produce a simulated bokeh effect live on the screen. The iPhone SE has only one camera but still takes portrait mode photos using algorithms to determine the borders of objects, which can detect even fine hair for use in the image.\nQuick Take\nA feature introduced in iOS 13 called Quick Take lets users quickly start recording a video when using the Camera app. While in the camera section of the Camera app, holding down the shutter button will begin recording in 1080p video. This is much faster than switching to the video mode if you're already snapping photos.\nNight Mode\nApple's Neural Engine can capture multiple exposures of a single scene and stitch it together into a fully exposed image. This is called Night Mode, and it occurs exclusively from every other camera operation. Bright scenes use HDR, medium scenes use standard exposure, and darker scenes default to Night Mode.\nWhen Night Mode is active, users can adjust the exposure time to multiple seconds, and the available time extends if the iPhone is used on a tripod. Capturing nearly pitch-black scenes or night skies is now easily done without technical skill. The resulting image will be exposed, so it still appears to be a nighttime or dark photo, an alternate approach to Apple's competitors.\nThe iPhone 12 Pro series added Night Mode portraits, and the entire iPhone 12 series supported Night Mode selfies, which carries over into newer models.\nDeep Fusion\nThis enigmatic feature was announced as a part of the iPhone 11 release in 2019. The user couldn't control or select it, and there is no setting anywhere in the OS for enabling it. The feature does not work with \"capture outside the frame\" enabled.\nWhen the shutter is clicked, the Neural Engine observes a still subject in medium lighting and automatically switches to multiple exposures. The iPhone will capture nine different images when this happens, with the one on the shutter press acting as the anchor image.\nThe Neural Engine and machine learning algorithms break all nine images down pixel by pixel and \"decide\" which pixel will remain in the final composite image. This results in a photo created by machine learning rather than based on what was captured by the sensor.\nA Deep Fusion photo will contain a higher amount of detail, color and shadow accuracy, and exposure when compared to images captured without the process. The feature is designed to be completely invisible, and users will not know if it has occurred or not without specialized software that searches metadata within the photo.\nApple upgraded its Deep Fusion system on iPhone 14 by moving it to earlier in the process, so images could retain more color and texture.\nDisplay\nSuper Retina XDR with ProMotion\n- Used on the iPhone Pro models\n- All-Screen OLED\n- HDR-ready\n- 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio\n- 120Hz variable refresh\n- True Tone\n- P3 Color\n- 1000 nits of brightness\nSuper Retina XDR\n- Used on the standard iPhone models\n- All-Screen OLED\n- HDR-ready\n- 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio\n- True Tone\n- P3 Color\n- 800 nits of brightness\nThe iPhone 11 and iPhone XR use a Liquid Retina HD display that is a LED with lower pixel density (326 PPI) and contrast ratio (1,400:1). The iPhone SE and older Touch ID-based iPhones use a screen called the Retina HD display, and it has the same specs as the Liquid Retina HD display but is a wide-screen display.\nSecurity and Privacy\nAny iOS device you buy comes fully encrypted by default. When setting up the device for the first time, Apple prompts users to secure their iPhone with a passcode or passphrase, then locks it with biometrics.\nBiometric data is end-to-end encrypted and stored within the Secure Enclave on the device. The actual biometric information is discarded. Instead, a mathematical representation of the data is stored in the Secure Enclave for comparison at each prompt.\nApple says privacy is a fundamental human right, and it designs its products with that in mind.\nFace ID\nAt the top of the iPhone, the sensor array contains infrared scanning technology that will collect depth and image data of the face being scanned every time Face ID is used. Machine learning algorithms also look for a \"live\" subject with eyes open and looking at the camera to prevent 3D models from fooling the technology.\nThe infrared scanner sprays the target with 30,000 dots to gather the face data. The eyes, nose, and mouth must be visible for the system to recognize the face when using traditional Face ID.\nHowever, Apple has added a new version of Face ID that uses the unique features found around a person's eyes to identify them. This allows for Face ID use while wearing a mask but isn't as secure as the traditional version.\nApple stated that Face ID is much more secure than Touch ID, and there is a 1 million to 1 chance of a random stranger unlocking your phone. Identical twins are the only exception, and Apple is looking to eliminate this anomaly through more advanced scanning technology.\nTouch ID\nThe Home Button on the iPhone acted as an iconic part of the device for its first ten years of existence until the iPhone X removed it in favor of a full-screen display. The iPhone 5S introduced Touch ID to the Home Button, which would scan for a fingerprint by taking a high-resolution image of the finger presented to compare to what is stored on the Secure Enclave.\nThe steel ring surrounding the Touch ID button would complete an electrical circuit with the user's finger\u2014 a fake finger or deceased person could not unlock the phone. The introduction of Touch ID brought secure encryption to the masses and still exists on some iPads and MacBooks.\nThe iPhone SE was the last iPhone with Touch ID. It was discontinued in February, 2025.\nApple Silicon\nApple builds its custom processors for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and the Mac. By developing its chipsets, Apple can customize its software to work directly with the hardware in a way that competitors cannot imitate.\nThese chipsets are the brains behind Apple's software platforms, machine learning algorithms, graphics processing, and Apple Intelligence. The built-in Neural Engine makes many operations much more efficient, from taking photos to editing video.\nThe A16 was introduced with the iPhone 14 lineup but was only used in the Pro and Pro Max models. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus got the A15 instead, likely as a differentiator and cost-cutting decision.\nApple's A17 Pro is used in the iPhone 15 Pro models and is the first chipset built on the 3nm process. It has hardware-accelerated ray tracing to push video games even further.\nA18 is used in the iPhone 16 lineup including the entry iPhone 16e. It enables powerful graphics processing and Apple Intelligence.\nPorts\nThe iPhone has used the Lightning port and cable since it debuted in the iPhone 5. Apple had always shipped its iPhones with a single Lightning cable and 5W adapter until the iPhone 11 Pro, which shipped with an 18W adapter.\nThe iPhone 12 did not ship with any power adapter or headphones, a move beneficial to the environment and Apple due to lower costs. This means the box is much smaller, so plastic and rare metal use are reduced, and shipping weight and size are also reduced. This is the equivalent of removing 400,000 vehicles from the road.\nWhile the iPhone 13 was rumored to be \"portless,\" the actual release used a Lightning port as usual. Apple continued to ship the iPhone 13 without earphones or a charger.\nThe iPhone 14 was the last new product with a Lightning port as EU regulations helped spur Apple to USB-C. The first iPhone with USB-C was the iPhone 15 released in 2023, and the last with Lightning was the iPhone SE discontinued in 2025.\nGoing forward, all iPhones will use USB-C. Apple differentiates the port between standard and pro models by offering USB 2.0 on the former and USB 3.2 gen 2 on the latter.\nAccessories\nEntire industries exist to provide accessories to the iPhone user base of over 1.5 billion users. Apple offers a few first-party accessories built to offer unique experiences, but third-party manufacturers provide most of the accessories made.\nMade For iPhone Program (MFi)\nApple lets companies license proprietary hardware for their products to produce accessories that work directly with iPhone and Apple technologies. The program still exists despite the move from Lightning, but involves different products and chips for licensing.\nMFi Software:\n- AirPlay\n- CarPlay\n- HomeKit\n- GymKit\n- iPod Accessory Protocol (iAP)\n- MFi Lightning Game Controller\n- MFi Hearing Aid\n- Wi-Fi Accessory Configuration (WAC)\nMFi Hardware:\n- Authentication coprocessors\n- Headset Remote and Mic\n- Audio Module\n- Lightning Analog Headset Module\n- Lightning to Headset Jack Adapter Module\n- Lightning connectors and receptacles\n- Magnetic Charging Module\n- Smart Connector\n- MagSafe\nCases\nApple makes premium and silicone cases for the iPhone and changes out the options and colors available on a seasonal basis. Third-party companies exist by the dozen that build custom cases to personalize users' iPhones.\nApple eliminated leather from its lineup in 2023, shifting to a material called FineWoven.\nWhile cases usually exist to provide protection and add personality to a device, many features and technology that otherwise do not exist within the iPhone. For example, Lifeproof makes a case that can be fully submerged for underwater video or photography.\nThere are many specialized cases available that include infrared scanners, microphones, game controllers, and modular camera lens mounts. There was even a first-party Apple Smart Battery Case that added additional battery life with a unique design that was ultimately replaced by the MagSafe Battery Pack.\nThe iPhone 12 and later, including the phones themselves and official cases, have built-in magnets. Apple calls its magnet system MagSafe, recycling an old branding name from defunct MacBook chargers. The magnets will work with an ecosystem of accessories, including wireless-charging pads and docks, car mounts, wallets, and sleeves. Both Apple and hardware partners like Belkin are making official MagSafe accessories.\nAudio\nApple purchased Beats by Dre to absorb their music-streaming service and talent, but along with that came an entire hardware branch. The company still exists as a branch within Apple, and it sells Beats branded headphones with custom chipsets made by Apple.\nBeats By Dre with Apple Silicon:\n- Beats Studio\n- Beats Solo\n- Powerbeats\n- Powerbeats Pro 2\n- Beats X\nApple has its brand of earbuds as well. The AirPods came about as Apple removed the headphone jack from their devices and ushered in a new era of totally wireless audio. Since their release, third-party manufacturers have raced to mimic the all-wireless design, but very few have come close to capturing the same form factor, and battery life found within AirPods.\nApple first-party audio:\nMagSafe and charging\nThe iPhone can use wireless charging, fast charging over USB-C PD, and standard charging over USB. To take advantage of wireless charging or fast charging, users must purchase those accessories separately.\nApple announced but never released a proprietary wireless charging system called AirPower. The charging mat was meant to simplify charging devices wirelessly by enabling users to place their iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch anywhere on the mat. The charging mat was ultimately canceled when Apple allegedly could not solve overheating issues.\nApple has since released a new charging and accessory system called MagSafe, which charges the iPhone at 15W and connects via a circular magnet. It is assumed that MagSafe will ultimately replace the Lightning port and handle data and charging on future iPhones.\nWith the iPhone 13, Apple introduced a new MagSafe feature, adding Find My support to the MagSafe wallet. Rather than checking for a ping from a tracker, the system instead tells users when and where the wallet was detached from the back of the iPhone.\nThe MagSafe Battery Pack with a Lightning port is no longer for sale as of 2023. Apple could revive the product with a USB-C port, but there hasn't been any signs of it being announced.\nPhotography and Videography\nThe mobile phone camera is probably one of the most important things customers consider before purchasing. Since the iPhone became such a popular pocket camera, manufacturers have developed accessories and tools specifically to aid video and photo production.\nGimbles, mounts, flash sync systems, camera lenses, and iPhone-connected smart cameras have created a large market centered around the iPhone camera. When browsing the iPhone homepage on Apple's website, most of the page is dedicated to discussing photo and video capabilities.\nWhen paired with the right talent and equipment, the iPhone can produce competitive high-quality content. A few movies have been made with the iPhone, like \"Unsane.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple TV shows recorded episodes using the iPhone to observe proper quarantine and distancing.\nApple introduced ProRes support in its iPhone 13 Pro range to play into home movie making. Pro users can record 4K 60Hz ProRes directly to an external USB-C SSD with iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro.\nServices\nThe iPhone wouldn't be what it is today without the help of software and services. Apple has slowly built an entire software ecosystem surrounding its ever-popular pocket computer. Through each of these services, paid or not, Apple adds to the base value of every iPhone sold.\nAfter years of being told that Apple was too reliant on the iPhone as a single majority source of income, the company uses its services branch to build out and diversify its revenue. Services have become the size of a Fortune 500 company itself and continue to grow with each new effort from Apple.\nUsers can bundle Apple's paid services under a tiered subscription service called Apple One.\nSiri\nWhen the iPhone 4S was released with a virtual assistant, no one took it seriously. Initially, Siri could only act as a voice-controlled assistant that handled the most simple task or query.\nNow, Siri is a powerhouse piece of machine learning that exists on every Apple device sold. On the iPhone, Siri not only acts as a user-facing assistant with deep app connections and controls, and it also serves as the background intelligence that powers everyday operations.\nContacts, Calendar, Photos, and even the system keyboard rely on Siri Intelligence to manage information and surface what is most relevant to the user. Siri also acts as the brains behind Shortcuts, which can be activated via the assistant, through widgets, or in-app.\nApple does not directly monetize Siri, but it does use the assistant as a primary selling point for iPhone and accessories like HomePod mini and AirPods.\niMessage\nApple has often stated that the Messages app is the most used app on the iPhone. An iMessage is an Apple proprietary technology using end-to-end encryption to send messages via the web. Sending and receiving iMessages is exclusive to Apple products and has been cited as a significant source of consumer lock-in.\nWhen communicating via iMessage, a user sees \"blue-bubble\" messages, can share complex multi-media files, and use sticker packs and message effects. Apple also enhances iMessage group chats with unique features like message threads and custom group chat images.\nApple Music\nThe music streaming service that birthed Apple's push into services debuted in 2015. Apple Music is $10.99 a month and offers student and family plans. The service lives within the Music app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and on the web.\nUsers can purchase music from iTunes when it is not available on the service, and it will be populated into their Apple Music library. If a user adds a physical CD to their Music app on macOS, the music will be synced across their account as well.\nApple Arcade\nApple Arcade is a monthly subscription service to games across all Apple platforms. A $6.99 per month subscription gains customers access to the entire game catalog and any new releases or updates.\nThe service has games from multiple genres and can be played with touch, though most titles support third-party controllers. Apple's push into gaming has made them embrace controllers like the Playstation Dualshock 4 and the Xbox Elite controller.\nApple TV+\nApple Studios is a new media branch within Apple that purchases and manages content for the video streaming service Apple TV+. The subscription costs $9.99 a month and exists on every Apple platform and several competitor devices.\nThe Apple TV app is needed for viewing Apple TV+ and is available in the following places:\n- Apple TV (Set-top-box)\n- iPhone\n- iPad\n- Mac\n- Roku\n- FireTV\n- Samsung Smart TV\n- LG Smart TV\n- PC\nApple News+\nApple News is a news aggregation app, and the company offers a premium content tier called Apple News+. The subscription is $12.99 per month and gives customers access to premium articles from newspapers and magazines.\nApple News Audio stories are exclusive to the iPhone application. Users can listen to articles read out loud and manage an independent queue of audio stories.\nApple Fitness+\nApple Fitness+ is a streaming fitness service with several workout types. Designed for Apple Watch users, it combines regularly updated workout videos with Apple Watch live health stats. It costs $9.99/month.\nApple revealed a SharePlay feature update to the service in 2021, enabling group workouts to be conducted remotely on multiple devices. In 2022, Apple removed the requirement for users to have an Apple Watch to participate in the service.\niCloud Storage\nThe term \"iCloud\" is a catch-all for Apple's syncing and storage service across devices and apps. The service portion of iCloud is specifically iCloud Storage.\nApple charges a monthly fee for the following storage tiers:\n- 5GB is free\n- 50GB is $0.99\n- 200GB is $2.99\n- 2TB is $9.99\n- 6TB is $29.99\n- 12TB is $59.99\nApple Card\nThe Apple Card doesn't seem to be a big earner for Apple but does add to the halo effect of capturing more customers who buy more Apple products. The card works best when used to buy more Apple products from Apple Stores and even allows customers to make interest-free purchases of nearly all Apple devices.\nDepending on the customer's credit score and other variables, the interest rate can vary from 13.24% to 24.24%. Purchases made with the physical card get 1% cashback, the card in Apple Wallet will net 2% cashback, and when used with specific partners and Apple itself, customers will get 3% cashback. Cashback rewards are automatically deposited into the customer's Apple Pay Cash balance.\nApple Card holders can open an Apple Savings account that can earn at 4.50% APY.\niOS 18\nAnnounced at WWDC 2024, iOS 18 is set to arrive in the fall alongside the iPhone 16. Here are some of the features users can expect to see.\nApple Intelligence\nThe most notable upgrade to Apple's upcoming operating systems is the integration of what Apple calls \"Apple Intelligence.\" Apple Intelligence is a personal-context based artificial intelligence. It is designed to work primarily on-device and help streamline tasks in a personal way.\nSome new features coming to the iPhone include on-device image generation, AI-powered writing and editing tools, and improved notification management.\nIt's worth noting that Apple Intelligence is only supported on the iPhone 15 Pro, M-series iPads, and M-series Macs.\nPhotos update\nA new Collections feature in iOS 18 automatically organizes the library by topics like Recent Days, Trips, and People & Pets. If you have a few favorite collections, you can pin them for quick access to the collections or albums most important to you.\nMessages updates\nApple has expanded Tapback options, now allowing users to respond to messages with any emoji, rather than the initial six it provided.\nThe new Send Later feature allows users to schedule when to send a message, which is perfect for ensuring you don't send someone a message when they're sleeping or when you want to schedule a birthday message.\nApple has confirmed that RCS support will arrive in iOS 18. RCS will improve messaging with Android devices by supporting read receipts, typing indicators, sending over Wi-Fi, and higher-quality media.\nThose who have an iPhone 14 or later will be able to use Messages via satellite. This new feature will allow users to send messages over iMessage and SMS, even without cellular or Wi-Fi service.\nWhen using iMessage, users can still use key features like sending emoji and Tapbacks, and anything sent via iMessage is end-to-end encrypted.\nGame Mode\nIn 2023, Apple introduced Game Mode to Mac \u2014 and a year later Game Mode is coming to the iPhone.\nGame Mode minimizes background activity while gaming. This allows the iPhone to sustain high frame rates for long gaming sessions.\nLocked and Hidden apps\nUsers can lock apps and require Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode to unlock them, lessening the fear of handing off your iPhone to someone else. Locked apps will not appear in search and notifications, either.\nApps can also be hidden by dragging them to a hidden apps folder, requiring users to unlock the folder via biometrics or passcode before viewing the contents.\nHome Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center customization options\nNow, on the Lock Screen, you can replace the controls at the bottom with something else, such as taking a note or quickly capturing a moment for your social media. If you have an iPhone 15 Pro, you can access these controls using the Action button.\nAs part of the expanded customization features, app icons, and widgets can now be scaled up to appear larger.\nUsers are no longer restricted to the standard app icon layout anymore. The new iOS 18 adds the ability to arrange apps along the bottom for quicker access or along the side to frame a favorite wallpaper.\nEach page of the Home Screen can feature a unique layout.\nManufacturing iPhone in the United States\nThere has been a lot of talk around the possibility of building an iPhone in the United States. Simply put, it isn't possible \u2014 at least not without incredible changes to the workforce, material availability, factories, and more.\nEven if Apple could perform final assembly in the United States by maximizing automation, most of the parts and materials would be sourced from abroad. The iPhone is a global product and the United States simply doesn't have the resources to make iPhone farm to table.\nThe discussions around manufacturing iPhone in the United States peaked in 2025 when the Trump administration levied extreme tariffs on countries around the globe. Tariffs were particularly high on China, which affects Apple the most.\nLearn more about iPhone\nLatest iPhone models:\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\nPrevious iPhone models:\n- iPhone 15\n- iPhone 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 14\n- iPhone 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE\n- iPhone 12\n- iPhone 12 mini\n- iPhone 11\nRumored iPhones:"

      "text": "All of Apple's operating systems have received a redesigned user interface called \"Liquid Glass,\" featuring translucent elements with rounded corners, and an all-around new look.\nOn June 9, at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers' Conference, the iPhone maker unveiled a series of design changes that have been implemented across all software platforms.\nThe company's goal was the creation of a unified design language that would lead to a harmonious experience when moving between different Apple products. The new design is available on iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and even tvOS 26.\nThe operating systems now have a similar look across the board, with a glass-like aesthetic inspired by visionOS. Apple's new \"Liquid Glass\" material behaves like real-world glass, particularly in the way that it refracts light and reacts to movement dynamically with specular highlights. Apple says it uses real-time rendering to achieve these effects\nIt adjusts based on the content you're watching, making it somewhat reminiscent of the blur effects introduced with iOS 7. The new material extends to various user interface elements, including buttons, switches, and more.\nLiquid Glass is used across new dynamic operating system elements that adjust according to the user's needs, allowing for a more intuitive experience. This means that tab bars can shrink and expand as needed. User interface elements designed for rectangular displays have now now feature rounded corners, much like Apple's more recent hardware releases.\nThe new Liquid Glass design language extends to the entirety of Apple's operating systems, including the Control Center, Lock Screen, Notification Center, Lock Screen, and widgets. iOS 26 features new Home Screen icons that were made using multiple layers of Liquid Glass, and there's even a new Clear look, in addition to the existing Light and Dark modes.\nThe Clear look is available on macOS Tahoe as well, making it so that both the Dock, its apps, and the Menu Bar all become transparent. This makes the display appear larger, according to Apple. On iOS, the Lock Screen clock now uses the same Liquid Glass material and it adapts to the image chosen by the user. The clock shrinks and expands as needed.\nDevelopers will also have access to an updated set of APIs, which will allow them to use the new Liquid Glass design for their own applications.\nApple says the new design blurs the lines between hardware and software, and explains that Liquid Glass was made through the close collaboration of the company's hardware and software development teams. Apple called the new material its \"broadest design update ever.\"\nStill, the redesigned user interface looks and feels familiar, and is a far cry from the circular app icons that were rumored ahead of WWDC."

      "text": "With iOS 26, Apple unveiled a unified design language with translucent elements that mimic the look of real-world glass. Here's how it compares to iOS 18.\nOn June 9, at its annual Worldwide Developers' Conference, the iPhone maker finally unveiled the long-rumored visionOS-style redesign we were all waiting for. The company's latest operating systems all received a revamped user interface with a new material dubbed 'Liquid Glass.'\nApple says that Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering to imitate the way glass refracts light, and explains that the new material reacts to movement dynamically with specular highlights. It's used across various user interface elements, including buttons, switches, app icons, the Lock Screen, Control Center, and more.\nThe company called Liquid Glass its \"broadest design update ever,\" but the claim is a bit of an exaggeration. Apple compared the redesign to iOS 7, saying that it \"sets the stage for the next era\" of its products, even though the change is nowhere near as drastic as it was back in 2013.\niOS 26 vs iOS 18: 'Liquid Glass' feels like a derivative change rather than a fresh new look\nMore than a decade ago, with the release of iOS 7, Apple phased out its iconic skeuomorphic design language. Gone were the hyper-realistic icons and app designs that mimicked real-world objects, most notably in iBooks and Calendar. The company switched it all out in favor of a flat design with bright colors and dynamic blur effects.\nThat design language stuck with iOS for the next eleven years, but its influence still lingers even in iOS 26. The operating system has retained the distinct color palette introduced with iOS 7, though its app icons have received a few visual tweaks. Even the all-new Liquid Glass material bears some resemblance to the blur effect introduced in iOS 7 and used through iOS 18.\nThe cross-platform design aspect of iOS 26 isn't anything new either \u2014 Apple has tried to unify its operating system designs before. Years ago, iOS 7 and macOS 10.10 Yosemite were early incarnations of the company's design unification efforts.\nmacOS Big Sur is the most obvious example, as Apple's desktop operating system gained square app icons and a redesigned Dock, both reminiscent of iOS and iPadOS. Previous releases of macOS maintained a distinct set of icons and UI elements that set them apart from Apple's mobile OS releases.\nDespite all the hype, other operating systems have used arguably similar glass-like transparency effects in the past. Windows Vista and Windows 7, for instance, featured a visually distinct Aero theme, which some users have compared to the newly announced iOS 26.\nMicrosoft phased out its iconic Aero interface with Windows 8, though, meaning that it hasn't been in use for over a decade. Relative to the Aero theme, Apple's implementation is much better at emulating real glass, as the Liquid Glass effects are dynamic rather than static.\nOverall, Apple's latest Liquid Glass material arguably represents consistency rather than true innovation, given Apple's previous design unification efforts. It's in line with what Apple and other manufacturers have done in the past, rather than something that has never been done before. It may not be up to everyone's liking.\nThough iOS 26 leaves a lot to be desired, the operating system does have a few areas where it truly stands out.\niOS 26 vs iOS 18: Where Apple's latest OS truly shines\niOS 26 introduces an entirely new \"Clear\" look that makes Home Screen apps fully transparent. It's an interesting choice, but not exactly groundbreaking either.\nIt builds upon the customization options introduced with prior iOS versions, such as the Light, Dark, and Tinted options that were already available in iOS 18. One benefit of the new Clear look is that users no longer have to rely on jailbreak tweaks to achieve transparent Home Screen icons, as they once did with Cydia tweaks such as WinterBoard and similar tools.\nAnother key change with iOS 26 is the introduction of dynamic elements that can increase or decrease depending on the user's needs. These upgraded context menus and tab bars utilize Apple's new Liquid Glass look, replacing the rectangular and often white UI elements found in previous iOS releases.\nYou'll notice the new UI elements across various system applications, including the App Store and Apple News. In the News app, for instance, the tab bar moves out of the way when you're scrolling, providing an almost full-screen experience that prioritizes the content you're trying to read. It's a neat change, overall.\nThe dynamic user interface elements allow for greater consistency across system applications and make navigation easier. Still, it's unlikely that the average user will notice the difference, given that iOS has been a mix of blur effects and rounded corners for years.\nThe Liquid Glass material is also noticeable in the Safari app. The new material is used for the URL bar and back buttons.\nThe Camera app now has a simplified user interface, and its buttons feature rounded corners as well. It makes for a useful change, unlike most of the redesign-related alterations in iOS 26.\nEven so, the new user interface elements wouldn't have looked out of place, even if they were added years ago. As for why this type of design wasn't implemented earlier, hardware limitations are a possible explanation.\nApple says that its Liquid Glass material was created through the close cooperation of its hardware and software teams. The software takes advantage of the improved hardware available in Apple's latest A18 and A18 Pro chips, which have the necessary processing power to achieve these glass-like effects.\nOlder hardware would likely struggle with Liquid Glass, so it's not much of a surprise that iOS 26 dropped support for the 2018 iPhone XR and iPhone XS. Years ago, when the iPhone 4 received iOS 7, the device never got any of its impressive blur effects.\nEnabling the blur effects through jailbreak tweaks revealed just how poorly the device performed, and a similar scenario likely would have affected 2018 iPhone models with iOS 26.\niOS 26 vs iOS 18: Why Apple may have opted for a redesign\nThough rumors of an operating system redesign have been floating around for at least a year, Apple may have chosen 2025 for a specific reason. The redesign is little more than a fresh coat of paint, but the company may have used it to hide imperfections, so to speak.\nTo be more specific, Apple's iOS 26 redesign serves as the perfect distraction from its Apple Intelligence debacle. Siri still lacks the personal context and in-app awareness features that were promised a year ago at WWDC 2024, and this very issue is the subject of two separate lawsuits filed against the company.\nIn short, Apple over-promised and failed to deliver, and the company was reportedly embarrassed about it, behind closed doors. With that in mind, it's not much of a surprise that WWDC 2025 was relatively light in terms of Apple Intelligence features. Sure, there's a new Foundation Models framework and an improved Shortcuts app, but not much else.\nApple may have wanted users to focus on the new glass-like design more than anything else, which is why it was featured at the beginning of the WWDC 2025 keynote. The company even went so far as to show off some of the tools presumably used during development \u2014 physical lenses and magnifying glasses in the shape of iOS user interface elements.\nThe distraction aspect alone, however, wouldn't have been enough to justify the redesign. During the keynote on June 9, Apple said that Liquid Glass would set the stage for future products, and the company may have had a specific device in mind. There have been rumors of an all-glass iPhone, with no display bezels, a curved frame, and no camera cutout.\nIt's been rumored that iOS 26 would serve as an indicator of what future products strive toward, that the operating system will influence the look of new hardware.\nSpecifically, the 20th anniversary iPhone is said to have the codename \"Glasswing,\" referring to a type of butterfly with translucent wings. It's set to debut in 2027, so we'll know soon enough if Apple's software influenced its hardware, and to what extent."

      "text": "The second developer beta of iOS 26 is finally here, and with it, an all-new ringtone, along with a few visual tweaks and enhancements. Here's what's new.\nOn Monday, two weeks after the debut of the first developer beta, Apple released iOS 26 developer beta 2. The update increases the build number to 23A5276f, up from the previous 23A5260u.\nWhile its predecessor, the iOS 18 update, focused largely on Apple Intelligence features, iOS 26 introduced a new \"Liquid Glass\" design language used across all Apple platforms. The software features dynamic user interface elements that mimic the look of real-world glass, replacing the flat aesthetic used from iOS 7 through iOS 18.\nThere's also a dedicated Games app, along with improvements to Image Playground, Shortcuts, and new features for the Messages and Phone apps. Additionally, Apple released a Foundation Models framework that lets developers use Apple Intelligence tools for third-party apps, while Visual Intelligence now works with screenshots.\niOS 26 developer beta 2 builds upon the design changes introduced at WWDC 2025 through minor improvements and visual tweaks.\nVisual changes in iOS 26 beta 2\nWith the second developer beta of iOS 26, Apple tweaked the appearance of the Control Center. It's somewhat darker than it was in the first developer beta, and the Control Center now uses a stronger blur effect.\nThere's also a new type of alert badge within iOS 26. Messages from unknown senders now use a blue badge, as opposed to the red app badge we've all seen in iOS for years.\nSimilarly, the Safari web browser received a minor layout change. Specifically, the \"More\" button with an ellipsis icon now lists all the available options within one column, enabling the same functionality through a more user-friendly interface layout. The tab view has been changed as well, but the core experience remains the same.\nApple has also brought back the stock iPhone wallpapers that were previously not available with iOS 26 developer beta 1. These model-specific iPhone wallpapers were present in earlier releases of iOS, meaning that their brief absence in beta 1 was an oversight. The default \"Glass\" wallpaper has been changed so that it now responds to device movement, much like the parallax effect of iOS 7.\niOS 26 developer beta 2 also addresses a Lock Screen issue where certain widgets would overlap with the text displayed by Focus Mode. Certain buttons and UI elements were updated with a glass-like look as well.\nNew ringtone and Apple Music widget\nAlthough the second developer beta of iOS 26 doesn't appear to have any major functional changes, it does contain a new variant of Apple's \"Reflection\" ringtone.\nBy opening the Settings app and navigating to Sounds & Haptics > Ringtone, you'll see a new option under the \"Reflection\" ringtone. Labeled \"Alt 1,\" the melody is a fresh take on the existing Reflection ringtone, meaning that it's no less recognizable than the original \u2014 which is still the default iPhone ringtone.\nAs a whole, the iOS 26 update also makes it much easier to add custom iPhone ringtones. The company's decision to include a new ringtone variant goes well with its improved customization options.\nAnother audio-related enhancement in iOS 26 beta 2 is the addition of an Apple Music widget for live radio broadcasts.\nBug fixes, Recovery Assistant, other changes\niOS 26 developer beta 2 addresses quite a few issues with new and existing iPhone software features. Notably, the update resolves an issue where AutoMix wouldn't work with AirPlay, and addresses some legibility issues in the Apple TV app.\nThe existing ChatGPT integration within iOS also received an improvement. Requests have now been split into two different types: Images and Other, though this particular change won't allow for a noticeably different user experience. The Mail app has a new order tracking feature.\nAdditionally, the release notes of iOS 26 developer beta 2 reference the new Recovery Assistant feature, introduced with the first developer beta of iOS 26.\nIt's a significant upgrade, as Recovery Mode now displays a lot more than just a static image on your iPhone. Instead, the new Recovery Assistant offers attempts to diagnose and resolve issues if your device encounters problems while booting up, and the on-screen text makes sure that you're aware of this functionality.\nThere's even a button at the top right of the screen, which allows you to restore your iPhone using another iOS device or an iPad, reducing the need for a PC or Mac to reinstall iOS.\nOverall, the second developer beta of iOS 26 is relatively light in terms of meaningful changes. While it does deliver a new ringtone and a couple of user interface enhancements, it doesn't contain any new features. Apple deploys new developer betas of iOS nearly every week or two, meaning that we'll likely see additional features and changes with subsequent software releases."

The fourth landed on July 22, the third appeared on July 7 for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, and visionOS 26, but tvOS 26, arrived one day later on July 8.\n- iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 beta 5 is build 23A5318c, replacing 23A5308g\n- watchOS 26 beta 5 is build 23R5340a, replacing 23R5328g\n- macOS Tahoe 26 beta 5 is build 25A5338b, replacing 25A5327h\n- visionOS 26 beta 5 is build 23M5322b, replacing 23M5311g\n- tvOS 26 beta 5 is build 23J5339a, replacing 23J5327g\nAlong these betas, Apple also introduced second release candidate builds for macOS 15.7 (24G210) and macOS 14.8 (23J10), and a sixth beta for HomePod Software 256, build 23J5339a.\nThe main fall release includes big changes, including the new cross-platform Liquid Glass aesthetic. It consists of a largely glass-based interface with transparent elements throughout the operating system and Apple's first-party apps.\nOther changes in iOS 26 include a new battery management system, an overhauled camera app, ChatGPT integration tweaks, and AirPods feature updates.\nFor iPadOS 26, it is more productivity focused with an updated Files app, Preview, and window management changes. The macOS Tahoe changes include the Phone app, Clipboard History, and a reworking of Spotlight.\nThe fifth iOS 26 developer beta added a new mode switching toggle to the Camera app, new splash screens for Apple's apps, more bouncy animations, and more app icon tweaks. There was also an alleged image-based leak indicating a change in resolution and screen size for teh Apple Watch Ultra 3.\nThe '26 betas aren't the only ones Apple is currently testing. It has been running a second track for current-gen operating system betas.\nAppleInsider and Apple strongly insist against users installing test operating systems or beta software onto primary or \"mission-critical\" hardware. Due to the increased risk of data loss and other issues, beta participants should use secondary or non-essential hardware and ensure they have sufficient backups of their critical data at all times.\nMembers of the public wanting to try out the features of the inbound generation should really use the public betas instead.\nFind any changes in the new builds?

      "text": "Apple is making it easier for iPhone owners to add their own custom ringtones, but the change in iOS 26 is only a slight improvement versus iOS 18.\nAdding ringtones to the iPhone is almost always an investment in time or money. Apple really wants its users to buy new tones via the Tone Store, charging for brief snatches of music from popular musical artists.\nThe alternative is to spend time and effort creating your own custom ringtones. We have written guides about it before, with it requiring the user to make an audio file that lasts up to 30 seconds in Garageband, exporting as a ringtone, then adding it to their iPhone's ringtone list.\nThis is a lot of effort for the average user to undertake. However, in iOS 26, it seems that Apple's taken a step to make it a little bit easier.\nA very small step.\nSimple-ish\nThe first developer beta includes a reasonably simple way to add a custom ringtone. The key is to select the file in an app and use the Share option.\nWithin the list should be an entry for \"Use as Ringtone.\" If it's not immediately visible, it may also appear under the More button as an extra option.\nOnce selected, the ringtone will appear under the main ringtone list under Settings. It appears at the top, just like other custom ringtones.\nWhile it is theoretically possible for the option to appear in the Share sheet whenever it is being used with a compatible audio file, it seems to be a little bit hit and miss.\nFor testing purposes, AppleInsider's created a custom sub-30-second MP3 file on a Mac using Audacity, AirDropping it to the iPhone, then using the Share option within Files. That worked, however using the same file in other locations, such as an attachment in Notes for example, didn't work.\nThis Sharing option also doesn't automatically turn Apple Music tracks into ringtones, either. You'll have to find a way to make custom files, or pay Apple for the official tones.\nCould be worse\nThough the discovery is a relatively small improvement for Apple when it comes to using custom ringtones, it's still a bit of a step forward for the company.\nFor a start, you no longer have to use GarageBand to export a ringtone, since other audio files will work fine. You can use other audio tools to make the MP3 file, or even find a file online if you want, and it should still work.\nMore importantly, it's an option within the Share sheet, which should mean it could be accessed throughout the iOS environment, so long as you are using an acceptable file.\nIt may not be as easy as buying a ringtone from Apple directly, but it's a tiny bit better than what users had before."
