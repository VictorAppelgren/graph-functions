  "title": "Trump hints at marijuana policy shift. What to know about THC",
  "description": "No judgment here \u2014 we're answering your burning questions about THC.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\nYes, though 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug. In 2023, Health and Human Services recommended that marijuana be moved to Schedule III. In 2024, DEA proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III. That rule change has been on hold since March 2025.\n\nIf all things marijuana sound confusing, it's not just you. No judgments here. But we'll help you out: We're answering your burning questions about THC.\n\nTetrahydrocannabinol, known colloquially as THC, isn't new. But more medical researchers are diving into learning more about how the drug affects the human body.\n\nAmong health experts, the jury is still out on THC, CBD and the use of marijuana in general, as those in medical and research fields (and in politics) weigh the benefits and risks.\n\n\"This is the big challenge with cannabis: How do we facilitate the beneficial medical applications, allow for what society has determined is acceptable recreational use and also guard against the very real harms?\" Gregory Tung, an associate professor at the Colorado School of Public Health who holds a doctorate in health policy, previously told USA TODAY. \"This is difficult and will likely require a mix of policy, rules, regulations and education.\"\n\nHere's what experts want you to know about THC.\n\nIn plain terms, THC is the part of cannabis that gets you high.\n\n\"People take and justify the use of cannabis medicinally for a wide range of reasons and ailments,\" he adds. \"What is supported in the scientific literature is much more limited. One of the areas that has the strongest scientific evidence is pain control and management. Recreationally, some people 'enjoy' the high.\"\n\nA 2023 meta-analysis of studies on cannabis's impact on health concluded that it can be beneficial in managing pain for people with several health conditions, but not without side effects. Experts as a whole say more research needs to be conducted to give a conclusive answer about benefits and risks.\n\nWhat is the safest THC product to buy?\n\nHealth experts including Tracy Smith, an associate professor at Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center who holds a doctorate in biological and health psychology, hesitated to label one THC product as the \"safest,\" in a previous conversation with USA TODA, because there still isn't much research on its health effects \u2013 especially long-term health effects.\n\nSticking to products with a lower concentration of THC, or consuming smaller amounts of THC in general is \"relatively less risky,\" Tung says.\n\nEach form of marijuana consumption offers pros and cons when it comes to dosing versus exposure to dangerous compounds, he adds.\n\nSmoking a joint may allow someone to pace themselves more effectively, because the high comes along faster than other forms. But, Tung notes, the act of inhaling combusted marijuana is \"very damaging.\"\n\nEdibles, by comparison, eliminate the dangers of inhaling combustion by-products. But the fact that they're metabolized much more slowly makes it more difficult to self-regulate dosage, Tung says.\n\nConcentrates, which are typically consumed via vaping, are \"likely the most dangerous\" option, Tung says, because they contain very high levels of THC. The National Institute on Drug Abuse notes that more research is needed, but that it appears high concentrations of THC can increase the likelihood of developing addiction, as well as experiencing side effects such as anxiety, agitation, paranoia and psychosis.\n\nSeveral experts \u2013 including those at the Colorado School of Public Health's Cannabis Research and Policy Project and the authors of the 2023 meta-analysis \u2013 say research supports the idea that young people and those who are pregnant are among the populations who should avoid cannabis as a whole because of high risks and harms.",

      "text": "Highlights\n- Cannabis refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant. The plant has many different chemical compounds, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which has intoxicating\u2014mind altering\u2014effects.\n- Cannabis products with THC can cause changes in mood, thoughts, and perceptions of reality. These products can also cause harmful health effects on the brain and other parts of the body. In recent years, there have been big increases in the variety of cannabis products and how much THC they have, as well as a greater variety of ways people can consume them. Unless mentioned otherwise, the information on this webpage is about cannabis products with THC.\n- NIDA funds research on the health effects of cannabis products, including impacts on the developing brain and on mental health. The institute also supports research on prevention and treatments for cannabis use disorder, the potential therapeutic uses of cannabis, and the public health impacts of cannabis policies.\nCannabis, which some people call marijuana, refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds of the Cannabis sativa L plant. The plant contains at least 125 different cannabinoids,1 including delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Delta-9 THC is the most abundant form of THC in the cannabis plant. It has intoxicating effects, meaning it can temporarily alter a person\u2019s mood, thoughts, and perceptions.\nThe Cannabis sativa L plant also contains non-intoxicating cannabinoid compounds like cannabidiol (CBD). CBD products are marketed for a variety of uses. Cannabis sativa L plants containing very small, non-intoxicating amounts of delta-9 THC, which are also called hemp, are mainly used for textile fiber and for their edible seed oils. Unless mentioned otherwise, the information on this webpage is only about cannabis products containing intoxicating amounts of delta-9 THC.\nPeople commonly use cannabis by smoking dried plant material (\u201cbuds\u201d or \u201cherb\u201d) in joints like a cigarette, in blunts\u2014cigars or cigar wrappers that have been partly or completely refilled with cannabis\u2014or in pipes or bongs (water pipes). Dried cannabis can also be vaped using electronic vaporizing devices such as dry herb vaporizers and vape pens.\nHowever, along with the cannabis plant flower, there are many products made from the cannabis plant and new ones are constantly being developed and sold. These include:\n- Oils and concentrates. Compounds in cannabis can also be extracted to make oils and concentrates that can be vaped or inhaled with devices that are like e-cigarettes. Smoking or vaporizing highly concentrated oils or extracts, also called wax or shatter, from the cannabis plant is known as dabbing. Dabbing can rapidly deliver large amounts of THC to the body, which increases the risk of negative side effects.\n- Edibles. Cannabis can also be mixed or added to foods like baked goods, candies, gummies, and drinks. Edibles typically take longer to show effects. People may use more of a product as a result, increasing the likelihood of serious negative health effects.\n- Tinctures. Tinctures are cannabis-infused alcohol or oils consumed in small amounts under the tongue or by adding to foods or drinks. This form of cannabis can also deliver large amounts of THC to the body.\n- Lotions and balms. These are products applied directly to the skin.2\nYes. Between 1995 and 2022 the delta-9 THC potency (strength) in illegal cannabis products seized by law enforcement quadrupled from 3.96% to 16.14%. Cannabis flower and concentrates in dispensaries can have THC concentrations of more than 40%.3 Higher THC concentrations have been associated with a greater likelihood of cannabis use progressing to cannabis use disorder, among other health concerns.4\nDelta-8 THC is another intoxicating cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant. Delta-8 THC products have not been FDA-approved for safe use. Eating large amounts of products containing delta-8-THC has led to medical emergencies, including breathing problems5,6. There is limited research on the health effects delta-8-THC and other intoxicating cannabinoids and related compounds, including delta-10-THC, THC-O-acetate, THCV, THCP, HHC, HHC-O-acetate, HHCP, and CBN.\nCannabidiol (CBD) is a compound found in the cannabis plant. CBD is marketed as an ingredient in many consumer products, including supplements, foods, oils, and lotions. CBD is not intoxicating like THC.7 However, it may have side effects including drowsiness, decreased appetite, vomiting and diarrhea.8 Products have been found to contain different amounts of CBD than their labels show, and some products marketed as CBD have been found to contain THC.9 Read more about CBD on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.\nSynthetic cannabinoids, which are lab-made substances that are chemically similar to compounds found in the cannabis plant, can produce serious negative health effects.10 These products, which are also known as Spice or K2, may have a much higher concentration of THC and can be much more powerful. Use of synthetic cannabinoids is associated with severe, potentially life-threatening health effects.11,12\nCannabis may affect people differently depending on: 13,14,15,16\n- The amount taken.\n- Potency (concentration of THC).\n- A product\u2019s ingredients.\n- The way it is ingested.\n- Other drugs a person may have taken.\n- A person\u2019s underlying medical conditions.\n- Age, sex, and genetic differences.\n- A person\u2019s experience with cannabis use.\nIntoxication\nMany people use cannabis to feel intoxicated or \u201chigh\u201d.17 Cannabis can make people feel more happy or relaxed. Cannabis can cause altered time perception, and impaired thinking, memory, and body movement. It can also it can also make people feel more irritable or restless.18\nAnxiety, Fear, Distrust, Panic, or Hallucinations\nThese effects are more common when a person takes a large amount, the cannabis product is strong (has a high level of THC), or the person has little experience with using cannabis.19,20,21\nPhysical Side Effects\nCommonly reported symptoms of cannabis use include increased appetite.22 Research shows that cannabis use may help manage symptoms of nausea or vomiting, common side effects of chemotherapy.23 However, other side effects may include an elevated heart rate and respiratory problems.20,24\nChildren eating cannabis edibles, such as gummies, is a growing health concern. This usually happens by accident and can result in hospitalization and serious illness.25,26 Eating large amounts of products containing delta-8-THC has led to medical emergencies, including among children.27,28\nHarms to Lung Health\nThe smoke from cannabis products contains many of the same toxins, irritants, and carcinogens as tobacco smoke, and smoking cannabis can also harm lung tissue.29,30 Long-term cannabis smoking is associated with respiratory issues such as large airway inflammation, increased airway resistance, lung hyperinflation, and chronic bronchitis.31,32,33 However, more research is needed, as high rates of tobacco use among people who also use cannabis make it hard to distinguish the effects of cannabis alone.34,33\nMental Health Effects\nCannabis use has been linked to certain mental health conditions. Read more about cannabis use and mental health.\nCardiovascular Effects\nCannabis can increase heart rate and blood pressure right after use. Some research shows an association between long-term cannabis use and an increased risk of stroke, heart attack, and arrythmias.35,36 However, more research is needed to determine if there is a direct connection between cannabis use and cardiovascular disease, or if other factors are involved.37\nGastrointestinal Problems\nThese include cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), which is when a person has nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain after long-term, heavy cannabis use.38 Other potential gastrointestinal issues include acid reflux, pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer disease.39\nIncreased Cancer Risk\nResearch has linked the use of cannabis products with an increased likelihood of developing head, neck, or throat cancer,40 particularly in people who smoke cannabis.41\nFrequent or heavy cannabis use has been linked to problems in cognitive functions like learning and memory, attention, processing speed, perceptual motor function, and language.42,43,44,45\nSome evidence has linked cannabis use to earlier onset of psychosis in people with genetic risk factors for psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, as well as worse symptoms in people who already have these conditions. The association between heavy cannabis use and schizophrenia has been found to be especially strong in young males compared to females. Cannabis intoxication can also induce a temporary psychotic episode in some people, especially at high doses. Experiencing such an episode may be linked with developing a psychotic disorder later in life.46\nSome research has also shown an increased risk of depression in people who use cannabis during adolescence.47 Research has also linked cannabis use with suicidal thoughts and behaviors among teens48 and military veterans in the United States.49,50\nWhile people with mental health disorders and related symptoms are more likely to use cannabis,51 many factors that influence mental health\u2014such as genes, trauma, and stress\u2014also influence how likely someone is to use drugs, including cannabis. Given these related genetic and environmental vulnerabilities, additional data from prospective, longitudinal research (studies that measure participants\u2019 health over long periods of time) are needed to determine whether, to what extent, and for whom cannabis may cause or contribute to poor mental health outcomes.\nCannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is when a person has nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain after long-term, heavy cannabis use.40 It can recur and often requires medical attention. People sometimes try to temporarily relieve their symptoms by taking hot showers or baths. However, CHS only resolves when a person stops using cannabis completely.52,53\nSecondhand smoke from cannabis products has many of the same toxins, irritants, and carcinogens as secondhand tobacco smoke.54 In some environments, secondhand cannabis smoke can produce positive cannabis drug test results.55 One study in a well-ventilated coffee shop found low levels of THC in the blood of non-smoking bystanders.56\nSecondhand exposure can also produce positive urine tests.57,58 This is also true for children. Positive urine tests have been reported in children exposed to secondhand cannabis in their homes or in attached homes,59 which can lead to respiratory infections.60\nThe use of cannabis during pregnancy may have harmful effects on a baby\u2019s health after birth. Research has linked it with lower birth weight, preterm birth, hospitalization, death within one year of birth, and other negative outcomes.61,62 Given the potential of cannabis to negatively impact the developing brain, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that obstetrician-gynecologists counsel women against using cannabis while trying to get pregnant, during pregnancy, and while they are breastfeeding.\nNIDA supports the HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study, which will follow a large population of mothers and their infants from the prenatal period through age 10. This study aims to better understand healthy development and shed light on how early exposure to cannabis and other substances, stressors, and trauma affect brain development and mental health, and how to reduce adverse outcomes.\nChronic, heavy\u2014every day or almost\u2014use of cannabis products with THC is associated with developing cannabis use disorder, a type of substance use disorder. Studies have estimated that 22% to 30% of people who use cannabis have the disorder.63,64 The strongest predictor of cannabis use disorder is how often someone uses it, but other factors, like a family history of drug use and how long a person has been using cannabis, can also play a role.65\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)\u2014a reference text published by the American Psychiatric Association that health professionals use to diagnose substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders\u2014defines cannabis use disorder as a pattern of use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress. This means a person has had two or more of the following symptoms in a 12-month period:\n- Using cannabis in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.\n- Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control cannabis use.\n- Spending a lot of time getting, using, or recovering from the effects of cannabis.\n- Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis.\n- Using cannabis even though it causes problems at work, school, or home.\n- Continuing to use cannabis despite social or relationship problems.\n- Giving up important hobbies, or activities with friends and family, or in the workplace to use cannabis.\n- Using cannabis in situations with risk of injury.\n- Continued use despite knowing that ongoing physical or psychological problems have been caused or worsened by cannabis use.\n- Cannabis tolerance, which is a need for increased amounts of cannabis to achieve the desired effect.\n- Withdrawal symptoms after stopping cannabis use.\nCannabis use disorder can be diagnosed as mild (when a person has two or three of these symptoms), moderate (four or five of these symptoms), or severe (six or more of these symptoms).\nA person may have withdrawal symptoms after stopping or significantly decreasing heavy or long-term cannabis use, even if they don\u2019t have cannabis use disorder. One study estimated that 12.1% of people who frequently use cannabis experience cannabis withdrawal.66 Withdrawal symptoms may include anger, irritability, aggression, feeling nervous or anxious, restlessness, decreased appetite or weight, depression, insomnia, experiencing strange or unsettling dreams, headaches, sweating, abdominal pain, and tremor. 65,67\nResearch shows that behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and contingency management can be effective in treating cannabis use disorder.68 Read more about behavioral treatments for substance use disorders on the National Institute of Mental Health website. There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of cannabis use disorder or for medically assisted withdrawal,69 but research is ongoing.\nCannabis products are among the first substances along with alcohol and tobacco that a person will likely encounter in their life (MTF, 2023), and people who use substances commonly use these before trying others. Still, most people who use or have used cannabis do not go on to use other substances later in life.71\nHowever, risk factors for cannabis use are similar to risk factors for use of other drugs with addiction potential,72 and studies have associated use of cannabis with developing cannabis use disorder. Using these products at a younger age in particular increases the likelihood of developing a cannabis use disorder later in life.73,74 In addition, using cannabis may cause brain changes that can make a person more likely to develop an addiction to other drugs.75\nStudies have found that using cannabis may affect a person\u2019s ability to drive.76 It is the drug most frequently found in the blood of drivers involved in motor vehicle crashes, including fatal ones.77 A number of research analyses have found that the risk of being involved in a crash increased after cannabis use.76,78,79 However, a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found no significant increased crash risk attributable to cannabis use.80\nAdolescence is an important period of brain development, and cannabis use may influence the brain in ways that could lead to long-term harmful effects.81,82 Studies show that regular, heavy cannabis use in adolescence is associated with negative effects on working memory, processing speed,83 verbal memory,84 and academic functioning.85 It is also associated with negative effects on educational attainment, employment, and income in young adulthood.86\nCannabis use at a young age has also been linked to other mental health conditions, including the likelihood of developing psychosis87 and to developing cannabis use disorder later in life.\nThe NIDA-funded Monitoring the Future survey measures drug and alcohol use and related attitudes among adolescent students nationwide. Find recent survey data related to cannabis use here. NIDA supports the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (ABCD Study\u00ae), which follows nearly 12,000 children ages 9 and 10\u2014before substance use typically begins\u2014into young adulthood.\nThe ABCD Study\u00ae explores the effects of environmental, social, genetic, and other biological factors on the developing adolescent brain. This study will provide critical insights into risk and resilience factors for cannabis and other substance use to inform future prevention interventions. See ABCD Study\u00ae results on cannabis exposure for more information.\nIn recent years, adults aged 50 years or older have had the largest increase in cannabis use compared to any other age group, with the greatest increase among those 65 years or older.88,89 Studies suggest that older adults mainly use cannabis to self-treat chronic conditions such as pain and musculoskeletal disorders, sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression, cancer, glaucoma, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and HIV/AIDS.90,91,92\nSome research suggests that cannabis use may have different effects on the brain in older adults compared to adolescents or young adults who use cannabis.93,94 Cannabis may also interact with other medicines older adults may be taking such as warfarin, opioids, and benzodiazepines.95,96\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of any product containing whole cannabis plant material for any purpose, even though cannabis and cannabinoid products are marketed for various therapeutic uses and are available in many states from medical cannabis dispensaries.\nHowever, the FDA has approved synthetic THC-based medications (dronabinol and nabilone) to treat nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Dronabinol is also approved to treat anorexia and weight loss associated with HIV/AIDS. The FDA has also approved a plant derived cannabidiol-based medication to treat seizures associated with rare forms of epilepsy.\nThere is evidence that cannabis can be effective in treating some forms of pain, and there is emerging evidence that it may have additional therapeutic uses. Research will continue to explore potential therapeutic effects of cannabis to help inform individual and public health decisions, including strategies to minimize potential harms associated with cannabis use.\nIt is important to consult with a doctor before consuming cannabis and cannabinoid products to treat medical conditions. Although research shows that people in the United States increasingly view cannabis use as low risk, it may cause negative health effects and can interact with other drugs a person is taking.97\n- NIDA funds research on the endocannabinoid system, cannabinoid compounds, and health effects of cannabis to support individual and public health.\n- The Institute\u2019s research supports development of new treatments for cannabis use disorder. It also includes research on the factors underlying substance use and substance use disorders, and on developing new ways to prevent substance use disorders.\n- NIDA supports epidemiology, policy research and public health outcomes research related to cannabis use, including the Monitoring the Future survey and a medicinal cannabis use registry.\n- NIDA also helps support the HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study, the largest long-term study of early brain and child development in the United States. The study will collect information about participants during pregnancy, at birth, and through early childhood. A subset of participants will include babies that were exposed during pregnancy or infancy to cannabis.\n- The Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (ABCD Study\u00ae) researches the impacts of cannabis exposure across the lifespan, from the prenatal period through adolescence and young adulthood, and later adulthood.\n- NIDA also funds research on potential therapeutic uses of cannabis and cannabinoids to reduce use of other substances, including opioids.\nLatest from NIDA\nCommercial interests contribute to drug use and addiction\nDelta-8-THC use reported by 11% of 12th graders in 2023\nReported drug use among adolescents continued to hold below pre-pandemic levels in 2023\nRead More About Cannabis\n- Read more about cannabis on the CDC web site.\n- Learn more about the regulation of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds from the FDA.\n- Find information and statistics on drug-impaired driving from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n- Find basic cannabis information from MedlinePlus, a service of the National Library of Medicine.\n- Radwan MM, Chandra S, Gul S, ElSohly MA.

      "text": "How long does marijuana stay in your system? What weed-users should know\nThe nationwide push to legalize marijuana got a major boost when the Biden administration announced a plan to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug in April 2024.\nWhile it's still illegal under federal law, marijuana is legal in some capacity in 38 states, plus Washington, D.C. Many use it recreationally, but there is also scientific evidence cannabis can be used for pain control and management.\nWhether you're a new or veteran user, here's what you need to know about how the drug affects your body.\nHow long does weed stay in your system?\nAfter weed enters your system, it can take between one to three hours to feel the complete effects and another one to three hours for those effects to wear off, according to Healthline. The effects of edibles last much longer than smoking, according to the American Addiction Centers.\nWeed can be detected in your body for far longer after its effects wear off.\nHow long do tests detect weed?\nCannabis can be detected in first-time smokers for about three days after smoking, but it may show up five to seven days after smoking in more consistent smokers (three to four times per week), according to Medical News Today. Daily smokers can expect tests to detect weed for at least 30 days.\nThere are several kinds of tests. Here's how long after smoking they can detect cannabis in your body, according to Medical News Today:\n- Urine tests: One to 30 days after use\n- Saliva tests: Usually within 24 hours but could detect up to 44 hours after use\n- Hair tests: Up to 90 days but may give false positives if you were recently in contact with another user\n- Sweat tests: Seven to 14 days\n- Blood tests: Only a few hours\nWhat is THC?: Answering the questions you were too embarrassed to ask\nWhat influences how long tests detect weed?\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the chemical in weed that gives users that high feeling. Every person metabolizes weed differently, which impacts how long it'll show up on a test.\nInfluential factors include the THC dose, the person\u2019s body fat, sex, how hydrated they are, recent exercise and their metabolism rate, according to Medical News Today. The strength and quantity of the THC consumed can be the difference between a positive and negative test, as drug tests are searching for THC, not cannabis.\nThose with higher body fat will metabolize weed slower than those with less fat, according to Medical News Today. Hydrating more than normal won\u2019t necessarily affect the results of a drug test, but dehydration may increase THC concentration. Regular exercise won\u2019t change a drug test\u2019s results, but exercising right before a drug test may increase the chance of a positive test.\nThose with faster metabolism rates will remove THC from the body quicker than those with slower metabolisms.\nHow to get weed out of your system\nThere aren't many options to get the weed out of your system faster. Time is your best bet, according to Healthline. Exercising regularly (although not right before a test), healthy eating and hydration can all help, but they won\u2019t substantially change your THC levels.\nDog got into your weed?: What to do, when to be concerned\nJust curious for more? We've got you covered\nUSA TODAY is exploring the questions you and others ask every day. From \"How long does alcohol stay in your system?\" to \"What is Delta-8?\" to \"Where is weed legal?\" \u2013 we're striving to find answers to the most common questions you ask every day.

      "text": "Biden administration plans to drastically change federal rules on marijuana\nThe Biden administration is poised to make a landmark change to the federal government's position on marijuana with a proposed plan that would no longer consider marijuana among the most dangerous and addictive substances.\nIn what would be the biggest change in marijuana policy the federal government has taken since pot was first outlawed, the Drug Enforcement Administration will take public comments on a plan to recategorize marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act, according to a source familiar with the process. The news was first reported by The Associated Press.\nThe Department of Justice will send its recommendation to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug to the White House Office of Management and Budget, according to the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Justice Department is expected to transmit the recommendation today, the source said.\nMore: Trucker failed drug test after taking CBD supplement. Supreme Court to decide if he can sue\nThe plan wouldn't legalize marijuana at the federal level outright, but it would reclassify it from a Schedule I drug \u2013 believed highly dangerous, addictive and without medical use \u2013 to a Schedule III drug that can be lawfully prescribed as medication. Marijuana has been a Schedule I drug since the Controlled Substances Act was signed in 1970.\n\u201cIt is significant for these federal agencies, and the DEA and FDA in particular, to acknowledge publicly for the first time what many patients and advocates have known for decades: that cannabis is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for tens of millions of Americans,\" said Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, which advocates for cannabis to be removed altogether from the list of controlled substances.\nThis bureaucratic move is only a small step toward what advocates hope will be full legalization of the drug. However, the new proposed classification does not fully address the inconsistencies between federal restrictions and the laws in a growing number of states that have authorized medical and recreational use of pot.\nTwenty-four states and Washington, D.C., have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and 14 other states authorize it for medical use, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\u201cRescheduling the cannabis plant to Schedule III fails to adequately address this conflict, as existing state legalization laws \u2013 both adult use and medical \u2013 will continue to be in conflict with federal regulations, thereby perpetuating the existing divide between state and federal marijuana policies,\" Armentano said in a statement.\nThe federal proposal to reschedule marijuana would have broad support among voters. A nationwide survey last fall commissioned by the Coalition for Cannabis Scheduling Reform found nearly 60% of likely voters supported rescheduling, with 65% of younger voters 18 to 25 favoring it, the highest of any demographic group polled. Overall, the number of Americans who think marijuana should be legal reached a record high at 70%, according to a Gallup poll in the fall.\nFor decades, marijuana has been listed under the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin, LSD and ecstasy. The act categorizes drugs based on their potential for abuse, addiction and medical use. Schedule I drugs are outlawed under federal law level and deemed to be without accepted medical use.\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a review of how marijuana is classified; and last year HHS recommended it be rescheduled to Schedule III, alongside drugs like Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids. The Justice Department did its own analysis and reached the same conclusion, the source said.\nThe proposal will undergo a public review period; the source did not say when the proposed rule would be open to public comment.\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Md., has previously criticized federal efforts to change Marijuana's classification. Harris was a physician at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, according to his online biography.\n\"Removing restrictions on an addictive gateway drug like Marijuana is a dangerous mistake. Numerous studies, including a recent and reputable study published by JAMA, points to the negative impact recreational marijuana has on the body and brain,\" Harris said in a Tuesday social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nExperts previously told USA TODAY that marijuana\u2019s placement on Schedule I was not based on credible scientific evidence of its perils, but once it was listed, researchers and advocates faced a heavy burden trying to prove it shouldn\u2019t face such stiff restrictions.\nWhat exactly does rescheduling cannabis mean?\nPlacing marijuana in Schedule III puts it on par with drugs, such as ketamine, testosterone, anabolic steroids or Tylenol with codeine, that have \u201cmoderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,\u201d according to the DEA.\nSchedule III drugs can be legally prescribed by licensed health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies. Rescheduling could also help resolve a massive federal tax burden that has been placed on cannabis companies \u2013 which were effectively seen as drug traffickers for tax purposes.\nBut rescheduling marijuana doesn\u2019t make it legal to use recreationally, and it doesn\u2019t change much about current state cannabis programs, said Jay Wexler, who teaches a seminar about marijuana laws at Boston University. It would still a controlled substance even with the new announcement\nWexler and other policy experts and advocates say rescheduling is not a solution, but it could be a sign the federal government is catching up with public opinion and consensus in the medical field that there are therapeutic benefits to marijuana, along with some risks.\n\"Rescheduling is a step forward, but it is not nearly enough. And there's no reason to keep cannabis in the Controlled Substances Act,\u201d Wexler previously told USA TODAY.\nWhat are the possible risks of marijuana?\nBecause of its classification, marijuana has been hard to study. But the move to reschedule marijuana is due in large part to its lower public health risk, federal scientists have said.\nIn a leaked HHS document, officials wrote to the DEA to support lowering its classification to Schedule III. Its risk for addiction was lower than other drugs and it had medical benefits, unlike Schedule I and II drugs, HHS researchers said.\nStill, scientists said, users develop moderate to low physical dependence on it, and there is some risk of psychological dependence. However, they noted, the withdrawal symptoms are \u201crelatively mild\u201d compared with alcohol. Marijuana is more comparable to tobacco, they said.\nThere are no known deaths from a marijuana overdose, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA. But it does affect physical and mental health.\nMarijuana can cause permanent IQ loss for people who begin using it at a young age, the institute said. Additionally, long-term use has been associated with temporary paranoia and hallucinations, and it can exacerbate symptoms with disorders such as schizophrenia, NIDA said.\nMarijuana smoke has a similar health impact to tobacco smoke. NIDA found people who smoke marijuana frequently develop issues with breathing, akin to tobacco smokers.\nSmoking cannabis, the most common way to consume the drug, may have additional risks because of particulate matter a person inhales, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Researchers noted cannabis smoke isn\u2019t all that different than tobacco smoke, the only difference being the added effect of the psychoactive drug THC in marijuana rather than nicotine in tobacco.\nRespiratory issues include daily cough, phlegm and a higher risk of lung infections, however, the institute said it\u2019s unclear if marijuana causes a greater risk of lung cancer.\nSmoking marijuana also increases heart rate, which can increase the chance of heart attack, especially among older people and people with heart conditions. The Heart Association journal study linked increased cannabis use with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\u201cDespite common use, little is known about the risks of cannabis use and, in particular, the cardiovascular disease risks,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Abra Jeffers, a data analyst at Boston\u2019s Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a statement. \u201cThe perceptions of the harmfulness of smoking cannabis are decreasing, and people have not considered cannabis use dangerous to their health. However, previous research suggested that cannabis could be associated with cardiovascular disease.\u201d She noted that smoking cannabis, which is the predominant way it is used, could pose other risks because it involves inhaling particulate matter.\nIn the study published in late February, researchers examined Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data of over 400,000 adults from 2016 to 2020, looking at self-reported cannabis use with cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart disease, heart attacks and strokes.\nPeople who used marijuana daily had a 25% higher chance of having a heart attack and a 42% higher chance of stroke than those who didn\u2019t use it at all.\nProposal reflects potential for health benefits\nThe cannabis plant has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries if not millennia. It appears to help with treating pain, insomnia, anxiety, and glaucoma, among other health conditions. Still, evidence is mixed and more research into its health benefits is needed, researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said in August.\nWhile the FDA hasn\u2019t approved the cannabis plant for any medical use, federal regulators have approved several drugs containing cannabinoids, or substances such as THC or CBD found in the cannabis plant, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nThese include Epidiolex, a purified form of CBD ingested orally, that is FDA-approved to treat seizures associated with two severe forms of epilepsy. Marinol and Syndros both contain synthetic THC and are used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Nabilone, another synthetic similar to THC, is approved as the brand name drug Cesamet for people with HIV/AIDS who experiencing weight loss and appetite loss.\nA 2017 federal report found cannabis or cannabinoids were more likely to reduce pain symptoms for patients with chronic pain. Additionally, there is some evidence that cannabis is effective in treating symptoms of multiple sclerosis, particularly addressing the stiff or rigid muscles caused by the disease. One cannabinoid drug, nabiximol, a mouth spray that has both THC and CBD, has been approved in several countries but not in the U.S. Under the brand name Sativex, it has shown pain relief for people with cancer or multiple sclerosis.\nOther research has examined cannabis\u2019 uses to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, but the NIH said the evidence is mixed."

      "text": "Justin Bieber, Martha Stewart and more promote cannabis use: Experts weigh in on THC vs. CBD\nWhat do Martha Stewart, Jaleel White (aka Steve Urkel) and Justin Bieber have in common? They're all in the cannabis business.\nIn October, Bieber partnered with Palms, a Los Angeles-based cannabis company, to create \"Peaches\" pre-rolled joints, a nod to his hit single from \"Justice.\" In the track, featuring Daniel Caesar and Giveon, Bieber sings about cannabis in the chorus: \"I got my peaches out in Georgia\u2026 I get my weed from California.\"\n\"Palms is excited to introduce a high-end line of indoor pre-rolls celebrating Justin\u2019s song, Peaches,\" reads a statement on the company's website. \"With this limited edition pre-roll collaboration, Justin & palms are proud to be supporting the Last Prisoner Project and Veterans Walk and Talk.\"\n\"Weed was something that I felt people tried to make me feel bad for enjoying,\" Bieber told Vogue about the collaboration. \"But I\u2019ve now found a place in my life for weed products that have been beneficial in my human experience.\"\nHe joins the many celebrities, including Snoop Dogg, Stewart, Jay-Z and Seth Rogen, who have joined the industry in recent years and are making bold statements with their products. Stewart's self-named brand of CBD gummies claims to \"make wellness an easier choice, every day,\" and Rogen's Houseplant strain of THC promises to give a \"smooth, warm and calming experience.\"\nThese lofty product claims may be seen as marketing ploys in an increasingly competitive industry, but experts say there can be wellness benefits to some of these products.\nHere's what they told us about marijuana and CBD in its various forms ahead of 4/20, an unofficial day that celebrates cannabis culture.\nWhat's the difference between THC and CBD?\nTHC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (Cannabidiol) are both chemicals known as cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant, but the two have differing effects and legal restrictions in the U.S.\n\"THC is (a cannabinoid) that has psychoactive properties, not that it's not healthy for you but it does get you high, unlike CBD,\" says Craig Henderson, CEO of Extract Labs, a Colorado-based company that specializes in extracting CBD from hemp plants for products.\nCBD's chemical compound doesn't alter a person's mental state and can be harvested from the same place as THC, but it is mostly taken from the hemp cannabis plant.\nMore: CBD products are popping up in stores near you. Here's what you need to know about them\nTHC is what's typically known as weed or pot and is legal recreationally in 15 states. Some states allow it to be used medicinally under a doctor's supervision.\nWhy are celebs getting involved?\nAs more states legalize marijuana, more eyes are turning toward the industry. Willie Nelson, Gwyneth Paltrow and most recently \"Crazy Rich Asians\" actor Jimmy O. Yang have lent their names to cannabis products.\nEach of their brands promise different results. Kristen Bell's Happy Dance CBD skincare says the products provide \"a little more calm,\" while \"Family Matters\" actor Jaleel White says his \"Purple Urkel\" brand is dedicated to celebrating the \"many medical breakthroughs\" of cannabis.\nBut those who have been in the industry a little longer than these big-name endorsers say it's a different type of green catalyzing interest.\nMore: Celebrities high on marijuana businesses\nMore: Martha Stewart partners with marijuana producer Canopy Growth to create hemp-derived goods\n\"Money is why they're getting involved,\" says Henderson. \"If you're a new CBD company, you haven't been around for four or five years, or just a cannabis company in general, how do you start off strong? You come in with a bunch of money, you bring on a spokesperson that already has a big name for themselves.\"\nWhere is recreational marijuana legal?\nIn March, New York became the 15th state to legalize marijuana in the United States. Other states include:\n- Alaska\n- Arizona\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Illinois\n- Maine\n- Massachusetts\n- Michigan\n- Montana\n- Nevada\n- New Jersey\n- Oregon\n- Vermont\n- Washington\nAre there wellness benefits to CBD, THC?\nDr. Patricia Frye, who works with patients in the D.C. area who are interested in cannabis treatments, recommends CBD for those who live in states where marijuana is not legal.\nFrye says both CBD and THC can help with sleep, anxiety, metabolism, stress and appetite.\n\"These cannabinoids are so helpful, (because) people are starting to move away from a lot of pharmaceuticals,\" she says.\nThere are still plenty of unknowns when it comes to CBD.\nThe FDA has approved the use of the drug Epidiolex, which contains CBD, for specific cases of seizures and epilepsy. The FDA-approved drug was placed in the \"least restrictive\" category of controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Agency, meaning it's in the same category as cough medicine Robitussin AC.\n\u201cBut overall, it\u2019s a lot safer than anything else you\u2019d be using if you\u2019re using it instead of opioids for pain or Ambien to help you sleep or instead of benzodiazepine for anxiety,\" said Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a Harvard Medical School professor and a primary care doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital.\nDoes CBD have side effects?\nDr. Leeta Jussila, a practitioner who specializes in cannabis, says that everyone's system is different, so the way people absorb CBD differs. She recommends new users consult with health care providers and closely track how small doses of the chemical effect them.\n\"They could get a headache. Sometimes people say, 'I feel funny,' but you\u2019ll never overdose on cannabis. You'll just start to detox,\" she said. \"CBD is an oil, fat, lipid. Some people might get diarrhea. I\u2019ve had one person get nausea, dry mouth or dizziness. But it depends on the quality of the product.\"\nFrye and Grinspoon both caution those looking to try CBD to do their research about the products they are purchasing.\n\"You have to be careful with purchasing CBD because like the nutritional supplement industry, it's not well regulated,\" Frye says. \"There are some very fine products out there and then there's a lot of junk out there. So people have to be careful.\"\n\u201cI\u2019ve had patients have what seems like a pretty dramatic effect beneficially, and I\u2019ve had other people say, \u2018Why did I just waste $60 on this? It didn\u2019t do anything,\u2019\u201d Grinspoon said. \u201cIt\u2019s very variable. It\u2019s complicated by the fact that it\u2019s not that regulated, so you have to be a savvy shopper to even be sure that you get the right amount of CBD that you\u2019re ordering.\u201d\nGrinspoon said it is important to look for a certificate of assurance when shopping for products.\n\u201cDon\u2019t just take their word for it. You know, if you go into a gas station, you\u2019re not necessarily going to get good CBD,\" he said.\nMore: Why is CBD on the rise for wellness products?\nMore: What is CBD oil?

      "text": "Buying delta-8 THC on 4/20? Maybe know these facts about 'diet weed' first\nDelta-8 THC has exploded in popularity across the United States as an alternate, legal form of marijuana.\nYou can find products containing delta-8 in gas stations, vape shops and online stores just about everywhere in states where it's not prohibited. But the substance is raising red flags with health experts and regulators, and for good reason.\nHospitals and poison control centers have seen a spike in cases where thousands of people have reported getting sick from exposure to delta-8 THC. Lackluster regulation of the industry is partly to blame, say experts.\nIf you plan on buying delta-8 for 4/20, which is widely celebrated by the cannabis community, here are some facts you should know.\nWhat is delta-8?\nDelta-8 THC is a chemical compound produced from hemp, a species of plant in the cannabis family. The compound is psychoactive, meaning it can get you \"high,\" though users have described delta-8 as a sort of \"diet weed.\" Its effects are weaker than delta-9 THC, the intoxicating component found in marijuana.\nThat's a key difference between delta-8 and delta-9. While marijuana is still illegal both in Indiana and roughly half the rest of the country, hemp \u2014 at the federal level \u2014 is not. It has no more than 0.3% of THC. The problem, experts say, is what manufacturers are doing when extracting that THC to create their product.\nIs delta-8 safe?\nWhile advocates claim delta-8 can help people manage joint pain and aid their sleep, the FDA strongly discourages people from using it. These products are not evaluated or approved by the federal agency.\nBetween Dec. 1, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2022, the agency received 104 reports of adverse reactions to delta-8 THC including hallucinations, vomiting, tremors, anxiety, dizziness, confusion and loss of consciousness, and regulators have found cases like these are continuing to rise.\nMore than 8,000 delta-8 related calls were logged at America\u2019s Poison Centers, which represents 55 poison control centers around the U.S., from 2021 to 2023, according to an investigation by the USA TODAY Network.\nHow is delta-8 legal?\nDelta-8 products would be illegal if not for a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill, which created a distinction between marijuana and hemp. Any cannabinoid derived from hemp, according to the bill, is legal so long as the final product has less than 0.3% THC.\nThe bill effectively transferred hemp from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act to the Department of Agriculture. Growers across the country seized on the opportunity and the \"diet weed\" industry boomed.\nIn May 2022, a federal appeals court upheld that delta-8 products were legal under the Farm Bill. If an unintended loophole was created, the court said, \"then it is for Congress to fix its mistake.\" In the years since, states have banned or restricted delta-8, while others are working to regulate the industry.\nTwo years ago during the 2022 growing season, Indiana issued 87 hemp licenses to 38 growers, 30 handlers and 19 grower/handlers.\nMap of where hemp is grown in Indiana\nIs delta-8 good for anxiety?\nSome people think so. Others have reported it makes their anxiety worse.\nWhat are the benefits of delta-8 THC?\nThe benefits of delta-8 THC are being investigated by medical experts. Some studies have suggested delta-8 can potentially treat a range of health and medical conditions, including anxiety, stress, depression and chronic pain, but experts caution considerable research still needs to be done to verify how effective such treatments are and the risks they pose.\nPeople have described having different reactions to delta-8 THC \u2014 some good, some bad. Those wanting to try it should talk with their doctor first, and be prepared to ask a lot of questions about how it could impact their health.\nWhat about advertising promising delta-8 is 'all natural'?\nDon't swallow advertising claims hoping you conflate \"all natural\" with \"all good.\" Just because something is \"all natural\" doesn't mean it's benign or safe to consume. Poison Ivy is \"all natural.\" So too is belladonna, nightshade, arsenic and lead. What matters, say experts, is how much of these foreign substances enter a person's body.\nBecause the amount of delta-8 THC in hemp is very low, manufacturers use additional chemicals when creating their products. The FDA, on releasing its guidelines for delta-8, said the process is unregulated and fraught with potential harm to consumers.\nManufacturing delta-8 can take place in unsanitary working conditions, says the FDA. It can involve unsafe household chemicals at dangerous amounts that can leave people feeling sick.\nThe bottom line is that consumers are putting their safety on the line because they don't always know they're getting with delta-8 THC.\nOthers are reading: Ohio voted to legalize recreational marijuana.
