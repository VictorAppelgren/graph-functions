  "content": "Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife Penny Knight have pledged to donate $2 billion to Oregon Health & Science University\u2019s Knight Cancer Institute, the school announced Thursday, describing it as the largest single gift to a U.S. university.\n\n\u201cThis gift is an unprecedented investment in the millions of lives burdened with cancer, especially patients and families here in Oregon,\u201d OHSU President Shereef Elnahal said in a statement.\n\nThe donation will help ensure patients have access to various resources, including psychological, genetic and financial counseling, symptom management, nutritional support and survivorship care, the university statement said.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited about the transformational potential of this work for humanity,\u201d the Knights said in the statement.\n\nThe university described it as the \u201clargest single donation ever made to a U.S. university, college or academic health center.\u201d\n\nIt surpasses the $1.8 billion given by Michael Bloomberg to Johns Hopkins in 2018, described by that university at the time as the largest single contribution to a U.S. university.\n\nBloomberg also donated an additional $1 billion to Johns Hopkins last year, covering tuition, living expenses and fees for students from families under certain income levels.\n\nThe magnitude of the donation will allow the Knight Cancer Institute to become a self-governed entity with its own board of directors within OHSU, the university said.\n\nKnight is Oregon\u2019s richest man. He and his wife previously donated $500 million to the cancer institute in 2013 on the condition the gift be matched within two years.\n\nUniversities across the country are struggling with moves from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to cancel or freeze research grants at universities.",

      "text": "Mike Bloomberg endorses Andrew Cuomo in NYC mayoral race\nFormer Mayor Mike Bloomberg is endorsing Andrew Cuomo\u2019s comeback bid for City Hall, saying the ex-governor is best equipped to run the Big Apple.\nBloomberg is backing Cuomo not only in the June 24 Democratic primary, but also in the general election, The Post confirmed \u2014 a blow to incumbent Mayor Eric Adams.\n\u201cI care deeply about the future of our city, and since leaving office, it has been difficult to watch its struggles, especially since the pandemic,\u201d the former-three-term mayor said Tuesday.\n\u201cIn sizing up the field in the race for mayor, there is one candidate whose management experience and government know-how stand above the others: Andrew Cuomo.\u201d\nThe billionaire business mogul will likely donate to Cuomo\u2019s campaign, a source in the Bloomberg camp said. But it was unclear whether he would give a massive donation to the pro-Cuomo Fix the City super PAC, which has no limit on the size of contributions.\nBloomberg, in his statement, said he had differences with Cuomo when the two served as mayor and governor, respectively.\n\u201cBut I also know his strengths as a leader and manager. Of all the candidates, Andrew has the skills our city needs to lead us forward,\u201d Bloomberg said.\nBloomberg did not mention any of Cuomo\u2019s rivals, particularly Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani.\nBut sources close to Bloomberg said he doesn\u2019t want an anti-capitalist tax hiker and foe of Israel running City Hall.\nCuomo appeared on Bloomberg TV Monday and he met with the owner of the namesake company afterwards, a source confirmed, and he must have won him over.\nThe endorsement is a big deal because Bloomberg has rarely weighed in on competitive local New York races since leaving office, particularly in party primaries, sources noted.\nBloomberg did not endorse in the 2021 Democratic mayoral primary, but he did back Adams in the general election that year against Republican Curtis Sliwa.\nThe scandal-scarred Adams is running for re-election on an independent line, meaning he will only appear on the November general election ballot.\nCampaign strategists and politicians said Bloomberg\u2019s backing could shore up Cuomo\u2019s support with moderate and Jewish Democrats, as well as voters on the fence who care about city management.\n\u201cIt will give Cuomo a boost with voters who care about the management of the city and issues related to the quality of life. Voters who thought Bloomberg was a good manager,\u201d said Basil Smikle, former executive director of the state Democratic Party and Columbia University lecturer on politics.\nBloomberg in his endorsement credited Cuomo with getting \u201cbig things done,\u201d citing the redevelopment of LaGuardia Airport, the opening of the 2nd Avenue Subway and creation of Moynihan Station \u2014 \u201cAll long-stalled projects that he jump-started and completed.\u201d\n\u201cHe has decades of experience navigating state and federal governments. He has governed as a pragmatist, focused on solving problems rather than engaging in ideological or partisan warfare,\u201d Bloomberg said of Cuomo.\n\u201cThe question before New Yorkers is not: Who is the perfect choice? No mayor is perfect. The question is: Who is the best choice? To me, that choice is clear: Andrew Cuomo.\u201d\nCuomo and Bloomberg had a complicated relationship during their time serving together.\nBloomberg had endorsed Cuomo\u2019s run for governor in 2010, and the thrice-elected Democrat was in the Executive Mansion for the businessman\u2019s final three years as mayor from 2011 to 2013.\nBut the two grappled over several issues, including a housing rental assistance program called Advantage and credit for passing New York\u2019s law legalizing same-sex marriage in 2011.\nStill, their disagreements were tame compared to Cuomo\u2019s nasty battles with Bloomberg\u2019s successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio.\nThe endorsement comes after Bloomberg\u2019s top allies have poured money into Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nEd Skyler, a former deputy mayor to Bloomberg who is now a top executive at Citigroup, recently donated $400 \u2014 the maximum allowed under restrictions for employees of a firm that does business with city government.\nHe told a former colleague that he would have stayed out of the race, if not for polls showing Mamdani closing in on Cuomo in the June 24 Democratic primary.\nA recent poll conducted for pro-Mamdani groups by the left-wing think tank Data for Progress showed the gap between the rivals narrowing to 51% to 49% for Cuomo, within the margin\u2019s 3 point margin of error.\nThis as an internal Cuomo campaign survey released Monday had him beating Mamdani by 12 points in the ranked choice voting contest.\n\u201cUltimately elections are about choices and there is no question New York City will be stronger and safer with a competent leader like Andrew instead of someone with a far-left agenda and no experience governing,\u201d Skyler told the pal.\nSkyler, a former Republican turned independent, previously eyed running for mayor himself. But he declined after Cuomo entered the race.\nA former deputy mayor of operations in the Bloomberg administration, Skyler is concerned about bolstering public safety and boosting economic development.\nHe was floored, a source close to him said, after reading in The Post that Mamdani targeted the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island for a boycott because of the Ivy League university\u2019s partnership with a leading Israeli tech school, Technion University. Bloomberg approved the high-tech campus to help diversify the Big Apple\u2019s economy.\nA pro-Palestinian activist, Mamdani, a state Assembly member from Queens, is a staunch foe of Israel and backs the boycott, divestment and sanctions, or BDS, movement against the Jewish state.\nSkyler is just the latest associate of Bloomberg to come off the sidelines to back Cuomo.\nLast month, the former three-term mayor\u2019s daughter, Emma Bloomberg, gave the $2,100 maximum contribution to the ex-governor\u2019s political comeback bid.\nBloomberg\u2019s right hand adviser Kevin Sheekey, who ran the billionaire\u2019s 2020 presidential bid and is a top executive at his namesake media company, also donated to the Cuomo campaign\u2019s kitty.\nThomas Secunda \u2014 the billionaire co-founder of Bloomberg LP \u2014 gave $40,000 to the pro-Cuomo super PAC Fix the City.\nSmikle, the political analyst, said the Bloomberg endorsement will help voters on the fence who are wavering between Cuomo, city Comptroller Brad Lander, former Comptroller Scott Stringer and Council Speaker Adrienne Adams over who\u2019s best equipped to manage the city.\nConversely, Bloomberg taking center stage in the race could rile up more progressive Democrats to back Mamdani, who worry that the rich are trying to influence the election.\nThat\u2019s certainly what Mamdani is hoping for.\n\u201cThe billionaires are consolidating around Andrew Cuomo because they know he will preserve the broken status quo,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement.\n\u201cNew Yorkers are rallying behind Zohran Mamdani because they are ready for a new generation of leadership that puts working people first. On June 24, we will shock the political establishment and win a city we can all actually afford.\u201d\nBut Cuomo was thrilled with having Bloomberg on his side, calling the former mayor a \u201cpreeminent statesman.\u201d\n\u201cAfter 9/11 when New York City was in crisis, torn apart and broken, under Mike Bloomberg\u2019s leadership our city was rebuilt \u2013 both our buildings and our soul. As Mayor, Mike turned a budget deficit into a surplus and fought for affordable housing and environmental justice, while championing public health initiatives and gun safety,\u201d Cuomo said.\nHe said under Bloomberg \u201cNew York City was the best run city in the country, and his leadership has been sorely missed every day since.\u201d\n\u201cToday, in this critical moment as New York City faces another crisis, I appreciate Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s support and faith in my vision for a stronger, safer, more affordable New York City for all,\u201d Cuomo said."

Our hearts go out to Chief Nate Hill, his wife and family for the loss of their little girl, who was victim of a dog attack,\u201d Burlington Police Department said.\nEmergency medical personnel rushed the child to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\nThe German shepherd was taken to the Burlington dog pound and euthanized, police said.\nDraco had been a single-purpose narcotics detection K-9 for the Cheyenne County Sheriff\u2019s Office, but was non-active at the time of the deadly attack, Kit Carson Sheriff Travis Beldon said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trained for detection.

      "text": "DC sandwich slinger ID\u2019d as DOJ employee, fired from position after hurling sub at federal agent\nWASHINGTON \u2014 His career is toast.\nA DC dimwit who slung a Subway sandwich at a federal agent on the streets of the capital earlier this week has been identified as a now-former Justice Department worker.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday that Sean Charles Dunn, 37, who is facing a felony assault charge for the sandwich strike, has been fired from his DOJ role.\n\u201cIf you touch any law enforcement officer, we will come after you,\u201d Bondi declared. \u201cI just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice \u2014 NO LONGER. Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d she added. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nDunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u2014 which handles cases of fugitives abroad and helps foreign countries on extradition matters with their own fugitives, according to the DOJ.\nDunn appeared to have been similar to a paralegal \u2014 assisting attorneys in handling a \u201clarge volume of cases, including the litigation of those matters,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s job listing for the position.\nHe does not appear to be an attorney as his name isn\u2019t listed on the DC bar\u2019s website.\nAn attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to requests for comment and attempts to contact Dunn directly were unsuccessful.\nDunn was allegedly caught on camera berating a group of federal officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before lobbing his deli sandwich and hitting a US Customs and Border Protection agent in the chest.\n\u201cF\u2014 you! You f\u2014ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d Dunn allegedly fumed within inches of an officer\u2019s face, per a criminal complaint.\nAccording to the complaint, Dunn successfully attempted to flee on foot, telling a local cop while he was being processed: \u201cI did it. I threw a sandwich.\u201d\nFootage of the incident went viral against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s deployment of hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel to assist DC police in cracking down on crime.\nDunn faces one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer and faces up to one year in prison if convicted.\n\u201cThe police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro declared in announcing the case against Dunn. \u201cHe thought it was funny. Well, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer.\u201d\n\u201cSo there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and activated the National Guard to patrol the District\u2019s streets.\nSince then, hundreds of federal officials have arrested more than 100 suspects, with 23 collared on Monday, 43 nabbed on Tuesday and 45 apprehended on Wednesday, according to data from the Trump administration.\nTrump\u2019s crackdown comes after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Edward Coristine \u2014 aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was beaten up while intervening to prevent a carjacking last week."

And he\u2019s getting a helluva woman.\u201d\nKrein also served on the Biden Cancer Initiative\u2019s board of directors between 2017 and 2019, and advised his 2020 presidential campaign on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an unofficial capacity.\nAt last year\u2019s DNC in Chicago, Ashley Biden recounted her wedding day and discussed her father\u2019s words to her before she tied the knot.\n\u201cBefore he walked me down the aisle, he turned to me and said he would always be my best friend.

      "text": "Nike founder Phil Knight donates millions in bid to keep Democrat from winning Oregon gov race\nNike co-founder Phil Knight has thrown his largess behind the Republican candidate in Oregon\u2019s race for governor because he\u2019s fed up with his state\u2019s left-leaning policies, the reticent billionaire said.\nIn a rare interview, the richest resident in the liberal Pacific Northwest bastion panned Oregon\u2019s lenient drug laws \u2014 which decriminalized the possession for personal use of small amounts of all drugs, including cocaine, heroin, LSD \u2014 and its misguided priorities such as the 2019 ban on plastic straws.\n\u201cOne of the political cartoons after our legislative session had a person snorting cocaine out of a mountain of white,\u201d Knight told The New York Times over the weekend. \u201cIt said, \u2018Which of these is illegal in Oregon?\u2019 And the answer was the plastic straw.\u201d\nWith current Democratic Oregon Gov. Kate Brown unable to run because of term limits, Knight has donated $1 million to Republican candidate Christine Drazan this month. He had also given $3.75 million to Independent candidate Betsy Johnson.\nKnight\u2019s donations \u2014 which represent the single largest financial support for both Johnson and Drazan \u2014 are an attempt to make sure Democratic candidate Tina Kotek does not win the statehouse, where a Democrat has held power since 1987.\n\u201c[I\u2019m an] anti-Tina person,\u201d he said, according to the Times.\nThe 84-year-old sneaker mogul switched his allegiance to Drazan because Johnson was lagging in recent polls, Knight told the outlet.\nKnight\u2019s infusion of cash has helped even the race. Kotek went from being the frontrunner to the Nov. 6 contest being declared a tossup, with Drazan pulling even or ahead in some polls.\nBut Knight\u2019s support of Drazan could get Nike into hot water because of the Republican\u2019s pro-life views in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s striking down Roe v. Wade. Nike has vowed to cover the abortion expenses of its employees who live in states with restrictive abortion laws.\nDrazan has said the state\u2019s initiative to support women who travel to Oregon for abortions is \u201coutside the mainstream.\u201d\nKnight is chairman Emeritus of Nike\u2019s board and he attends its meetings as a non-voting observer, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\u201cNike has good leadership. They make choices, whatever they want, but I think I\u2019m more conservative than Nike,\u201d he told the Times when asked about the company\u2019s policy in aiding employees seeking an abortion.\nIt\u2019s not the first time, Knight has backed a Republican in his state. In 2018, the billionaire Knight donated $2.5 million to the campaign of Oregon Republican gubernatorial candidate Knute Buehler in his bid to unseat Brown. Buehler ended up losing 50.0% to 43.9%.\nKnight also gave $1 million to the Republican Governors\u2019 Association, which supported Buehler\u2019s campaign."
