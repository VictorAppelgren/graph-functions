  "description": "In today\u2019s issue:   Trump puts FBI crime fighters on D.C. streets  Ukraine fights for spot at Trump-Putin summit Netanyahu on defensive with Gaza takeover Experts go to school on elementa\u2026",
  "content": "\u2022 Experts go to school on elementary students\n\nPresident Trump today will explain what he sees as a role for FBI law enforcers on Washington, D.C., streets as part of his crackdown against violent crime.\n\nThe FBI began over the weekend to dispatch about 120 agents to work overnight shifts to help local law enforcement prevent carjackings and violence as Trump scheduled a news conference for this morning.\n\nHe said he wants to \u201cstop violent crime\u201d and tackle homeless encampments in the nation\u2019s capital after signing an order last month making it easier to arrest homeless people.\n\n\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d the president wrote on Truth Social on Sunday. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d\n\nLast week the president began wielding crime statistics to make his case, including data that Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) disputed on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf the priority is to show force in an American city, we know he can do that here,\u201d Bowser, who initially offered no public comments as the president vowed to federalize the city, told MSNBC on Sunday. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be because there\u2019s a spike in crime.\u201d\n\nDescribing himself as \u201cno \u2018MR. NICE GUY,\u2019\u201d Trump said on social media over the weekend that federal action will \u201cimmediately clear out the city\u2019s homeless population and take swift action against crime.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s aggressive approach echoes his focus on border security and migrant criminals, themes during his campaign and in the first six months of his second term.\n\nIn Los Angeles in June, Trump deployed active-duty troops to bolster federal arrests of migrants while rejecting the opposition of Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). FBI agents also were used during that operation before Trump withdrew the troops in mid-July. His presidential action in California will be scrutinized during a federal trial that begins today as part of a challenge brought by the governor.\n\nViolent crime rates in Washington dropped 35 percent from 2023 to 2024, marking the lowest rates recorded in more than 30 years, according to a January report by the Justice Department.\n\nBut Trump reacted last week to social media and news accounts of car jackings and melees involving teenage attackers while continuing to describe the nation\u2019s capital as unsafe, unsightly and poorly managed by Democratic politicians. He and advisers say D.C. police and prosecutors are too lenient. He called for juvenile suspects to be charged in the adult justice system.\n\nTrump has long been critical of conditions in Washington and in other major U.S. cities governed by Democrats, including New York, his hometown.\n\n\u201cWe want our Capital BACK,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThe deployment of FBI agents to deal with local crime puts federal agents from the bureau\u2019s counterintelligence, public corruption and other divisions with minimal training in traffic stops out on the streets, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, suspects as young as 15 can be charged as adults.\n\n\u201cYoung people are coddled, and they don\u2019t need to be coddled anymore,\u201d U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the city\u2019s new prosecutor appointed by Trump, said last week. \u201cThey need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nSmart Take with Blake Burman will return on Wednesday.\n\n\u25aa The share of moms with young children in the workforce fell this year, as return-to-office measures and government layoffs take an outsize toll on women.\n\n\u25aa Trump hasn\u2019t applied to the National Capital Planning Commission for approval of his planned 90,000 square foot White House ballroom. It\u2019s a statutory requirement and a review can take years.\n\n\u25aa U.S. companies are repurchasing their stock shares at a record pace. It\u2019s boosting their balance sheets and fueling a rally in financial markets.\n\nALASKA SUMMIT: As the war in Ukraine rages on, Trump will meet Friday in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It will mark the first meeting between a U.S. president and the Russian leader since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nAs of Monday, major logistical components, including a venue, remained up in the air, as White House officials raced to lock down details.\n\nIn his first few months back in office, Trump and his administration have pushed for an end to the war in Ukraine, with no luck. Trump said last week he is going to meet with Putin in Alaska to speak about an end to the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has not been invited to the summit, raising concern among Kyiv\u2019s allies across the globe. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Sunday that he hopes Zelensky will be involved in the summit.\n\nVice President Vance, interviewed Sunday on \u201cFox News,\u201d said the U.S. is working to set up a separate meeting that also includesZelensky. Vance said he did not think it would be a good idea for Putin and Zelensky to meet before Trump\u2019s meeting on Friday with the Russian president.\n\nVance said he wants peace and to stop funding the Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re done with the funding of the Ukraine war business,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cWe want to bring about a peaceful settlement to this thing.\u201d\n\nLAND DISPUTE: Putin\u2019s reported proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine, which would require Kyiv to cede regions in the east, sparked a firm response from European leaders on Saturday. They welcomed Trump\u2019s efforts to negotiate a ceasefire as part of an effort to permanently end the nearly three-and-a-half-year war but argued that \u201conly\u201d an approach that mixes support for Ukraine, \u201cactive\u201d diplomacy and additional pressure on Moscow can lead to peace on the front lines.\n\nZelensky said Sunday that his country will not let Russia \u201cdeceive\u201d the U.S.\n\n\u201cOf course, our team is working with the United States \u2014 not a single day goes by without communication on how to ensure real peace,\u201d Zelensky said in an address, according to a translation released by his office. \u201cWe understand Russia\u2019s intention to try to deceive America \u2014 we will not allow this. I greatly value the determination with which President Trump is committed to bringing an end to the killings in this war.\u201d\n\n\u25aaThe Hill: NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the alliance is \u201cmaking sure that Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight\u201d ahead of the summit.\n\n\u25aaThe New York Times: Washington\u2019s push to negotiate an end to the war has raised concerns the Trump administration will make concessions to Moscow that Kyiv finds unacceptable.\n\nNO CONCESSIONS: Russian officials and commentators crowed about landing a summit between Putin and Trump, which apparently came without the Kremlin having made any clear concessions over its war in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s special economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev said the decision to hold the summit in Alaska was symbolically important for the U.S.-Russian partnership. The U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre.\n\n\u201cTrump has chosen to host Putin in a part of the former Russian Empire,\u201d Michael McFaul, an Obama-era U.S. ambassador to Russia, wrote on the social platform X. \u201cWonder if he knows that Russian nationalists claim that losing Alaska, like Ukraine, was a raw deal for Moscow that needs to be corrected.\u201d\n\n\u25aaThe Hill: Trump critic John Bolton, a former national security adviser during Trump\u2019s first term, criticized the upcoming U.S.-Russia meeting in Alaska, arguing Trump\u2019s actions have not changed foreign policy. Bolton asserted Trump is motivated by a desire to capture a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\u25aaThe Hill: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says that peace negotiations in Alaska could be \u201ca positive step forward\u201d if \u201can agreement can be negotiated which does not compromise what the Ukrainians feel that they need.\u201d\n\nGAZA: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended his plans to take over additional areas of Gaza, despite widespread international criticism. Netanyahu said Israeli forces would \u201cquickly\u201d evacuate and then seize Gaza City, as well as a cluster of refugee camps in the enclave\u2019s middle region.\n\nBut critics said the proposed new military offensive is likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and further endanger the hostages still being held by Hamas. Thousands protested across Israel over the weekend, renewing calls for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres criticized Israel\u2019s plan, saying in a statement that the plan \u201cmarks a dangerous escalation\u201d and \u201crisks deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians.\u201d\n\nTrump is giving a tacit green light for Netanyahu\u2019s military push, framing the move as an Israeli-owned decision amid a global outcry. A defiant Netanyahu on Sunday insisted there is no starvation in Gaza. Netanyahu only conceded there was \u201cdeprivation\u201d in the enclave, but he said \u201cno one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war\u201d if Israel was implementing a \u201cstarvation policy.\u201d\n\n\u25aa CNN analysis: Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza takeover plan satisfies no one but himself.\n\n\u25aa The New York Times: How European leaders tried to halt the war in Gaza.\n\n\u25aa Politico: The \u201cday after\u201d plan for Gaza that Netanyahu doesn\u2019t want to talk about.\n\nWHERE AND WHEN\n\u2022 The president will hold a news conference at 10 a.m. in the press briefing room.\n\u2022 The House will hold a pro forma session on Tuesday at 9 a.m. and will return to work in Washington on Sept. 2.\n\u2022 The Senate will hold a pro forma session at 8 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\nCOURTING ENDORSEMENTS: Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) is leaning heavily into the Texas redistricting battle as he seeks to fend off an uphill, conservative primary challenge from state Attorney General Ken Paxton (R).\n\nLast Tuesday, Cornyn publicly called for FBI Director Kash Patel to assist in tracking down Texas state Legislature Democrats who fled the state in protest of the GOP\u2019s proposed congressional maps, which could net them five seats in Congress.\n\nTwo days later, the senator and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) separately confirmed that the FBI was assisting in the effort. The move to get out in front of the redistricting battle allows Cornyn to ingratiate himself with the state\u2019s deeply conservative base, writes The Hill\u2019s Julia Manchester, as they have distanced themselves from the incumbent senator in his uphill primary battle against Paxton.\n\n\u201cI think this is a good opportunity for Cornyn to show that he\u2019s a fighter and that\u2019s willing to take on an issue that\u2019s a red meat issue that resonates with the base,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, Cornyn\u2019s former campaign manager and a Texas-based GOP strategist. \u201cWhen you see those opportunities, you have to take them.\u201d\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday the FBI does not have jurisdiction to return Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking the FBI to get involved, to find these legislators who are in the process of trying to defend democracy in Texas,\u201d Holder said on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cAnd they\u2019re not hard to find, but the question after that is, \u2018Well, what\u2019s the federal jurisdiction? What federal statute has potentially been violated? What\u2019s the basis for any federal government interaction?\u2019 And I would say that there is none.\u201d\n\n\u25aa NBC News: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) slammed Trump as a \u201ccheater\u201d and Abbott as a \u201cjoke\u201d days after welcoming Texas Democrats who fled their state.\n\nLONE STAR EXAMPLE: States across the country are looking to follow Texas\u2019s lead in redrawing their congressional district lines ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nMultiple Democratic and Republican governors are seeking to add as many seats as they can for their parties and increase the chances that their party can win control of the House next year. The Hill\u2019s Jared Gans breaks down which states are most likely to make the next redistricting moves.\n\n\u25aa The Hill: These are the top House Democrats at risk from GOP redistricting.\n\n\u25aa The New York Times: The independent body that redraws California\u2019s political maps isn\u2019t perfect, many Republicans say. But they prefer it to the gerrymander Newsom is proposing to offset the one in Texas.\n\nFLORIDA: When Miami-Dade County turned red in November, after nearly three decades of being solidly blue, Democratic political operatives in Florida had their worst fears realized: The Sunshine State was in fact red. The signs of a flip from purple had been there for several cycles and further cemented by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s 2022 win, when he won the metropolitan county for the GOP for the first time in 20 years. But Florida Democrats say they haven\u2019t given up on trying to move their state back into purple-state-territory. In fact, they say, they\u2019re doubling down on their efforts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still rebuilding, but we\u2019ve had a lot of success,\u201d Nikki Fried, the chair of the Florida Democratic Party, told The Hill\u2019s Amie Parnes, although she acknowledged there is \u201ca lot of work to be done and resources we\u2019ve brought into the state to do that work.\u201d\n\n\u25aa The Hill: Republicans are waging a multipronged campaign against abortion shield laws in blue states, hoping to force the federal government to ultimately ban them. Legal experts say the effort will be difficult \u2014 as some states have already learned.\n\nINFLATION: The rising costs of goods and inflation are a growing political problem for Republicans as Trump\u2019s latest round of tariffs are scheduled to kick in. Democrats see high costs as their best issue heading into the midterm election. But Republicans have yet to come up with a clearly defined strategy to address the problem of high prices, which they highlighted repeatedly in the 2024 election ahead of their sweeping victories in the presidential, Senate and House races.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Trump\u2019s beating that Fed rate cut like a dead horse,\u201d one Republican strategist told The Hill\u2019s Alexander Bolton, referring to the immense pressure the president has put on the Federal Reserve to cut rates.\n\nLOCKDOWNS AND LEARNING: Children attending preschool and kindergarten this fall may prove to be tiny teachers among researchers who plan to study whether babies born during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic differ from their predecessors as new classroom learners, possibly because of factors that include school and societal adaptations amid the nation\u2019s first brush with lockdowns and a new virus. Educators say they worry about cognitive and social delays, such as difficulties sharing and following directions, among 4- and 5-year-olds who entered the world beginning in 2020.\n\n\u25aa CBS News: Meanwhile, the COVID-19 virus is on the rise again, especially in the West, according to state and government data.\n\nCOMPUTER CHIPS: Companies Nvidia and AMD are expected to kick 15 percent of what they make in China sales of artificial-intelligence chips to the U.S. government in a highly unusual arrangement crafted by Trump. The agreement follows Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s meeting with Trump last week.\n\nFEDERAL DATA: The Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics will soon get a new leader after Trump fired the last commissioner following the release this month of a weak jobs report. E.J. Antoni, the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, is among those under consideration and has been a longtime critic of the agency\u2019s approach to collecting jobs data, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.\n\n\u25aa The Hill: Some advocates for higher education fear potential repercussions of Trump\u2019s order to colleges and universities to turn over more college admissions data.\n\n\u25aa The Hill: Trump could be the \u201cwild card\u201d in a deal between the NFL and ESPN. Here are five things to know.\n\n\u25a0 A risky peace gamble in Alaska, by The Washington Post editorial board.\n\n\u25a0 Dangerous nostalgia: Trump wants to turn back time, by A. Scott Bolden, opinion contributor, The Hill.\n\nAnd finally \u2026 What are Labubu dolls and why did they land in national headlines last week when thieves stole a store\u2019s inventory of the pricey collectibles?\n\nAnswer: The haul near Los Angeles of toothy little monsters created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung was valued at $7,000.\n\n\u201cWe are still in shock,\u201d One Stop Sales, the store that was robbed, said in a social media post while urging people to help locate the burglars.\n\nThe current craze for the colorful adornments, which have been described as \u201ccreepy but cute,\u201d is being driven by social media, natch.\n\nLabubus, which are manufactured by Pop Mart, a Chinese toy company based in Beijing, are hard to come by and are subject to U.S. tariffs. The popularity of the petite gremlins has spawned fakes.\n\nWe want to hear from you! Email: Alexis Simendinger (ASimendinger@TheHill.com) and Kristina Karisch (KKarisch@TheHill.com).

  "summary": "President Trump is set to hold a news conference to explain the role he sees in Washington, D.C., for FBI law enforcement in a crackdown against violent crime. The president plans to use this initiative to \u201cstop violent crime\u201d and address homeless encampments in the city. The FBI has dispatched about 120 agents to work overnight shifts to help local law enforcement prevent carjackings and violence. This follows his focus on border security and migrant criminals in his second term. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser disputed these claims, calling for juvenile suspects to be charged in the adult justice system. The deployment of FBI agents puts federal agents from the bureau\u2019s counterintelligence, public corruption and other divisions out on the streets.",

      "text": "Nearly two years into the war in Gaza, the Israeli security cabinet voted for yet another military expansion: the proposed takeover of Gaza City. The plan, which was initiated and pushed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself, arguably reveals more about his domestic political maneuvering than evidence of any well-thought-out military strategy.\nThe plan was adopted despite the Israeli military leadership\u2019s fierce objection and grave warnings it could both deepen the humanitarian crisis and endanger the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza., The major expansion of the war also comes against the backdrop of a fundamental erosion of support for Israel around the world, and a decline in internal public backing for the continuation of the war.\nAnd yet, Netanyahu pushed his plan forward, as it has at least one unstated benefit: it gives him time to fight for his political survival. And with his current far-right coalition partners, that means prolonging the war. Time and again, Netanyahu\u2019s allies, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, have thwarted and aborted progress in ceasefire negotiations by threatening to collapse his government if the war were to end.\nNetanyahu\u2019s plan to besiege Gaza City actually falls short of what his coalition partners demand: Ben Gvir and Smotrich are pushing for a full occupation of the embattled enclave as a first step for rebuilding the Jewish settlements in Gaza and ultimately annexing the territory. It is also less than what Netanyahu himself had been selling ahead of the meeting.\nIn an interview on Thursday, Netanyahu told Fox News that Israel intends to take control of all of Gaza, as if he had made up his mind to fully occupy the territory.\nInstead, the Israeli leader chose to promote a phased plan, focusing only on Gaza City for the time being, without taking over other camps nearby, where many of the 20 remaining Israeli hostages are believed to be held captive. Netanyahu also intentionally set a relatively loose deadline for the beginning of the operation - in two months - leaving the door open for another diplomatic push for a ceasefire hostage deal to reemerge and call the whole thing off.\nNow, his right-wing partners are fuming at the decision, charging that the plan isn\u2019t enough and that only escalating the war will suffice\nA source close to Smotrich said, \u201cThe proposal led by Netanyahu and approved by the cabinet may sound good, but it is actually just more of the same. This decision is neither moral, nor ethical, nor Zionist.\u201d\nNetanyahu\u2019s latest plan pleases neither his coalition partners nor Israel\u2019s military leadership. During the marathon 10-hour cabinet meeting, Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir presented the army\u2019s stark opposition to the government\u2019s reoccupation plans. Israel\u2019s top general warned that a renewed military excursion would endanger both the remaining hostages and Israeli soldiers, cautioning that Gaza would become a trap that would further exhaust IDF forces already worn down by almost two years of continuous fighting, and deepen the Palestinian humanitarian crisis.\nThe military concerns echo the broad public Israeli sentiment: according to repeated opinion polls, a majority of Israelis support a ceasefire deal that would bring back the hostages and end the war. But Netanyahu\u2019s current decision-making is disconnected from both military advice and popular will, driven instead, analysts and political opponents say, by the narrow imperative of his political survival.\nThe Gaza takeover plan also places Netanyahu and Israel in unprecedented international isolation. Despite the unwavering free hand that President Trump\u2019s White House has given him in the Gaza war, the growing famine and starvation crisis has already diminished global legitimacy for Israel\u2019s war, and the additional fallout from the latest cabinet\u2019s decision was swift and unambiguous: Germany \u2013 Israel\u2019s second most important strategic ally after the United States \u2013 announced it was suspending some of its military exports to Israel, setting the stage for other EU countries to further downgrade relations.\nNetanyahu is pushing forward with a plan that satisfies no one: Israel\u2019s allies abroad, its own military leadership, a public that wants the war to end on the one hand, and on the other, his hardline partners who are unhappy and think it does not go far enough.\nThe constituency it does serve is primarily Netanyahu himself: buying him more time to avoid the inevitable choice between a genuine ceasefire that could save the hostages or a full military escalation that satisfies his coalition. More than a strategic move, it represents yet another classical Netanyahu maneuver to prolong the war, while perpetuating harm and suffering for Gaza residents and Israeli hostages alike. All for his own political survival."

      "text": "President Donald Trump framed his Friday summit with Vladimir Putin as a moment to feel out the Russian leader\u2019s parameters for ending the war in Ukraine and acknowledged it would take further meetings to strike a final peace deal.\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. \u201cBut it might be bad.\u201d\nIt was the clearest picture yet of what Trump hopes to accomplish Friday in Alaska, where urgent preparations are now underway for the first US-Russia leaders summit in more than four years. Trump, who once promised to end the war in Ukraine within a day of taking office, said he would know within two minutes during Friday\u2019s meeting whether such a resolution is even possible.\n\u201cI may leave and say, \u2018good luck,\u2019 and that\u2019ll be the end. I may say this is not going to be settled,\u201d he said.\nTrump signaled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would not participate in Friday\u2019s summit, though the US president previewed his plans to phone Zelensky immediately after the meeting, along with other European leaders, to brief them on the session with Putin.\nTrump said his goal is ultimately to get Putin and Zelensky in the same room to hash out their differences, and surmised only they would be able to find a way to end the war \u2013 almost certainly, he said, with some \u201cland swapping\u201d between them.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to make a deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both.\u201d\nTrump was speaking as American officials rush to finalize details ahead of Friday\u2019s summit, with both logistical and geopolitical issues still unsettled four days ahead of the momentous sit-down.\nAs of Monday, no venue for the summit had been announced. Administration officials were making their way to Alaska \u2014 selected for its centrality to Washington and Moscow \u2014 to scope out where, exactly, the US and Russian presidents would meet.\nOfficials were also working to clarify the contours of the two men\u2019s expected discussion, which Trump hopes can yield significant progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.\nAfter US officials spent the weekend briefing European leaders about their expectations for the summit, it was Trump himself who offered the most illuminating perspective in his appearance on Monday.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to meet with President Putin and we\u2019re going to see what he has in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s a fair deal, I\u2019ll reveal it to the European Union leaders and to the NATO leaders, and also to President Zelensky.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s comments underscored the extraordinary moment he finds himself in seven months into his second term. After entering office hoping to leverage his relationship with Putin to end the Ukraine war, only to become disillusioned by the Russian leader\u2019s duplicity, Trump is now embarking on the biggest test yet of his long-held faith in face-to-face diplomacy.\n\u201cNext Friday will be important, because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,\u201d NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who has forged a close partnership with Trump, said Sunday on ABC.\nTrump has told advisers in private that any attempt to end the war is worth the effort, even if it isn\u2019t ultimately successful. He pressed his team to organize this week\u2019s meeting with extraordinary speed; typically, high-profile summits, particularly with adversaries like Russia, take weeks or months to plan.\nAs the week opened, a number of questions were hanging over the preparations.\nOne was whether Zelensky would be invited. The White House hasn\u2019t ruled out including him in Alaska, but officials said their priority was organizing the Trump-Putin one-on-one.\nTrump affirmed Monday that Zelensky likely wouldn\u2019t be present in Alaska.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a part of it. I would say he could go, but he\u2019s been to a lot of meetings. You know, he\u2019s been there for three and a half years. Nothing happened,\u201d Trump said.\nZelensky warned Monday that making concessions to Moscow will not persuade it to stop fighting in Ukraine, urging \u201cstronger global pressure\u201d on Russia. He stressed that Moscow is showing little sign of winding down its campaign.\n\u201cAnother week has ended without any attempt by Russia to agree to the numerous demands of the world and stop the killings,\u201d Zelensky said on X.\n\u201cRussia is dragging out the war, and therefore it deserves stronger global pressure. Russia refuses to stop the killings, and therefore must not receive any rewards or benefits. And this is not just a moral position \u2013 it is a rational one. Concessions do not persuade a killer. But truly strong protection of life stops the killers,\u201d he added.\nUkrainian officials made clear Zelensky was prepared to travel to Alaska if invited by Trump. But they also acknowledged much would hinge on how the Trump-Putin meeting unfolds.\n\u201cWe have shown that he is ready to be anywhere to advance the agenda of peace. So, if needed, President Zelensky, of course, will be present at the meetings. We have been very open about it, but let\u2019s see how this will go,\u201d the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, said on CBS.\nAnother question was what, precisely, Putin put on the table during his meeting with Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff last week to convince the US the time was right for a meeting between the leaders. While exact details of his proposal remained hazy, it was clear that major land concessions on the part of the Ukrainians would be central to his plan.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be some land swapping going on,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s very complex, because you have lines that are very uneven, and there\u2019ll be some swapping, there\u2019ll be some changes in land.\u201d\nOn both fronts, European leaders have been anxiously awaiting more details from the United States. The way they understand it, the plan put forward by Putin would give Moscow control of Ukraine\u2019s entire eastern Donbas region, which Russia partially occupies. The fate of the two other regions that have been in Putin\u2019s sights, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, remained unclear, as did the status of US security guarantees going forward.\nTrump\u2019s aides believe it\u2019s important to have buy-in from European nations on the president\u2019s peace efforts, and spent much of the weekend explaining Trump\u2019s objectives while hearing out concerns about how Putin might approach the session.\nAt a meeting in the English countryside on Saturday, Vice President JD Vance listened as several national security advisers from major European nations spelled out the parameters they believed must be upheld in peace talks with Putin.\nAtop their list was the importance of implanting a ceasefire before any further ideas are discussed \u2014 a mandate Putin has repeatedly rejected in the past.\nThe Europeans have also pressed for reciprocity in any land concessions, positing that if Ukraine cedes territory in the eastern Donbas region, Russia must also pull back its occupation in other parts of Ukraine.\nPerhaps most urgently, however, the leaders said Ukraine itself must be involved in discussions about its future.\nA US official said the meeting, held at the stately home of the British foreign secretary, yielded \u201csignificant progress.\u201d Two European officials said they felt Vance was receptive to their viewpoints and actively engaged their ideas.\nAnd Zelensky said afterward he believed the US was listening.\n\u201cOur arguments are being heard,\u201d he said during his nightly address.\nTrump, meanwhile, spent much of the weekend hearing from allies about the importance of including Ukraine in any discussions about its future.\nAfter playing a round of golf with Trump on Saturday, Sen. Lindsey Graham said he, too, wanted Ukraine to be a part of the peace talks.\n\u201cI do hope that Zelensky can be part of the process. I\u2019ll leave that up to the White House,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said on NBC. \u201cBut I have every confidence in the world that the president is going to go to meet Putin from a position of strength, that he\u2019s going to look out for Europe and Ukrainian needs to end this war honorably.\u201d\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said he planned to speak with Trump on Sunday, reiterated the European position that any discussions on Ukrainian territory must involve Ukraine and Europe.\n\u201cWe hope and assume that the government of Ukraine, that President Zelensky, will be involved in this meeting,\u201d Merz said in an interview with German public broadcaster ARD, adding later: \u201cWe cannot accept that territorial issues between Russia and America are discussed or even decided over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Daria Tarasova-Markina and Christian Edwards contributed to this report.\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments."

      "text": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker slammed President Donald Trump as a \"cheater\" and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as a \"joke\" days after welcoming Texas Democrats who fled their state in protest of GOP-led redistricting efforts.\n\"Governor Abbott is the joke,\" Pritzker, a Democrat, told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview that aired Sunday in response to Abbott calling Illinois\u2019 congressional map a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\"He's the one who is attempting mid-decade here \u2014 at a time when, frankly, all of us are concerned about the future of democracy. He's literally helping whittle it away and licking the boots of his leader, Donald Trump,\" Pritzker added.\nPritzker also defended himself against allegations that Illinois' congressional map is gerrymandered. Trump won 44% of the statewide vote in 2024 but Republicans hold only three of the state's 17 House districts.\n\"We held public hearings, legislative hearings. People attended them. They spoke out. There was a map that was put out. There were actually changes made to the map. And a map was passed, and it was done at the end of the census, the decennial census. So that's how it's done in this country,\" Pritzker said.\nHe went on to say, \"This is \u2014 it's cheating. Donald Trump is a cheater. He cheats on his wives, he cheats at golf, and now he's trying to cheat the American people out of their votes.\"\nDemocratic state legislators from Texas have been huddling in Illinois and other blue states after leaving the state to deny GOP leaders a quorum in the state House. Republicans have repeatedly attempted to move forward with their legislative plans, but have fallen short of the 100 people necessary for a quorum.\nAbbott and his Republican allies late last month unveiled plans to draw new congressional district lines in the state that could guarantee their party up to five additional safe Republican seats in Congress. The process of redrawing district lines traditionally happens only once a decade, after the decennial census is conducted.\nAbbott has clashed with Democrats in the Legislature in the past and GOP leaders in Texas have threatened the Democratic legislators with suspension of pay and civil arrests if they don\u2019t return to the statehouse.\n\u201cDemocrats act like they\u2019re not going to come back as long as this is an issue. That means they\u2019re not going to come back until like 2027 or 2028, because I\u2019m going to call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there,\u201d Abbott told NBC News in an interview Thursday.\nOn Sunday, Abbott reiterated that point, telling \"Fox News Sunday,\" \"This could literally last years, because in Texas, I\u2019m authorized to call a special session every 30 days. It lasts 30 days. And as soon as this one is over, I\u2019m going to call another one, then another one, then another one, then another one.\"\nAbbott also warned Democrats that they would be arrested if they came back to Texas.\n\"If they show back up in the state of Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the Capitol,\" he said. \"If they want to evade that arrest, they\u2019re going to just stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years.\"\nTrump has defended Abbott and Texas Republicans' efforts to draw new maps that favor the GOP, telling CNBC's Squawk Box last week, \"We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats. We have a really good governor, and we have good people in Texas. And I won Texas.\"\n\u201cI got the highest vote in the history of Texas, as you probably know, and we are entitled to five more seats,\" he added.\nOn Sunday, former Attorney General Eric Holder, who has fought gerrymandered state congressional maps as the head of National Democratic Redistricting Committee, also spoke to \"Meet the Press\" about Texas' redistricting plan and California Gov. Gavin Newsom's proposal for his state to respond in kind.\n\"What I've said is that we have to protect our democracy now if we ultimately want to be able to save it,\" Holder said Sunday. \"And so taking the reasonable steps that have been proposed in in California, I think it makes a great deal of sense in this moment, a temporary way in which to respond to that which is happening in Texas, with the thought that after this crisis has passed, we get back to the fight against gerrymandering by anybody.\"\nHolder stressed his opinion that any forthcoming Democratic gerrymandering should be a response to Texas, not a permanent way to draw district lines.\n\"If Texas had not moved in the way that they appear to be doing, California would would not be doing what they're doing,\" Holder said. \"What Democrats are doing is is responsive and is temporary.\"\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, also addressed her party's effort to redraw the state's congressional map in response to Texas' move in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\"These times call for fighting fire with fire,\" Hochul said. \"We didn\u2019t ask for this fight. I\u2019m busy governing the state of New York focusing on public safety and affordability. Why are we here today? Because Donald Trump looked at the polls for next year.\"\nHochul said state Democrats would put forth an amendment to New York's constitution in order to redraw the state congressional map before the next U.S. census is completed, which would need approval from voters.\n\"We can put it to the people,\" Hochul said. \"But I think the people of this state, after what they\u2019re seeing when there\u2019s one party domination in Washington, and how our costs are going up, we\u2019re losing jobs and people are suffering, they\u2019re going to want us to use every tool in the arsenal to fight back, and that\u2019s what I intend to do.\"\nVice President JD Vance, who visited Indiana last week to discuss redistricting, blamed Democrats for the GOP push to redraw state congressional maps in an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News. Vance said gerrymandering in blue states like New York, California and Illinois \"actually suppresses the will of the people in states like Indiana.\"\nVance also argued that the large number of undocumented immigrants in California have given the state a disproportionately high number of congressional seats, noting that, although such immigrants are not allowed to vote, they are still counted in the census.\n\"California has way more House seats than it should because they have such a high population of illegal aliens,\" Vance said. \"So, they get rewarded for welcoming illegal aliens into their state, giving them federal benefits, actually asking the taxpayers of states like Ohio to subsidize them. And then those same taxpayers in Ohio and Indiana and elsewhere, they have fewer congressional representatives because of what California has allowed to happen. That's ridiculously unfair,\" Vance said.\nHe added, \"The only real way to fight back against it is for us to redistrict in some ways, as aggressively as these hard blue states have done.\"\nTrump last week floated the idea of excluding undocumented immigrants from the next census, even though the Constitution says that all people in the U.S., regardless of citizenship, should be counted in it.\nIn his \"Meet the Press\" interview, Pritzker also responded to reports that the FBI granted a request from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who is running for re-election in 2026, to help track down the Democratic state legislators who fled Texas.\n\"There's no federal law that would allow the FBI to arrest anybody that's here visiting our state,\" Pritzker said. \"So it's a lot of grandstanding. That's what this is all about.\"\nPritzger was also asked about the war in Gaza and a Senate resolution this week to block arms sales to Israel amid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\"I think that the resolution that was put up in the United States Senate was an effort to send a message. And it\u2019s the right kind of a message, which is that Israel needs to make sure that the food assistance that ought to go to innocent Palestinians should arrive there,\" he said. \"And they should do everything in their power to prevent the starvation that I think we\u2019ve all seen.\""

      "text": "Press Release\nViolent Crime in D.C. Hits 30 Year Low\nFor Immediate Release\nU.S. Attorney's Office, District of Columbia\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc\nContact\nUpdated January 3, 2025\nTopic\nViolent Crime\nComponent"

      "text": "Trump demands homeless people 'immediately' move out of Washington DC\nUS President Donald Trump has said homeless people must \"move out\" of Washington DC as he vowed to tackle crime in the city, but the mayor pushed back against the White House likening the American capital to Baghdad in Iraq.\nThe Republican president has also trailed a news conference for Monday about his plan to make the city \"safer and more beautiful than it ever was before\".\nMayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said: \"We are not experiencing a crime spike.\"\nTrump signed an order last month making it easier to arrest homeless people, and he last week ordered federal law enforcement into the streets of Washington DC.\n\"The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social on Sunday. \"We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.\"\nAlongside photos of tents and rubbish, he added: \"There will be no 'MR. NICE GUY.' We want our Capital BACK. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\nThe specifics of the president's plan are not yet clear, but in a 2022 speech he proposed moving homeless people to \"high quality\" tents on inexpensive land outside cities, while providing access to bathrooms and medical professionals.\nOn Friday, Trump ordered federal agents - including from US Park Police, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and the US Marshals Service - into Washington DC to curb what he called \"totally out of control\" levels of crime.\nA White House official told NPR that up to 450 federal officers were deployed on Saturday night.\nThe administration is also considering deploying National Guard members, although Trump has not yet made a final decision, according to reports by Reuters and ABC News.\nTrump's moves come after a 19-year-old former employee of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) was assaulted in an alleged attempted carjacking in Washington DC.\nTrump vented about that incident on social media, posting a photo of the bloodied victim.\nMayor Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday: \"It is true that we had a terrible spike in crime in 2023, but this is not 2023.\n\"We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low.\"\nShe criticised White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller for dubbing the US capital \"more violent than Baghdad\".\n\"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,\" Bowser said.\nWashington DC's homicide rate remains relatively high per capita compared to other US cities, with a total of 98 such killings recorded so far this year. Homicides have been trending higher in the US capital from a decade ago.\nBut federal data from January suggests that Washington DC last year recorded its lowest overall violent crime figures - once carjacking, assault and robberies are incorporated - in 30 years.\nTrump has promised a news conference at the White House on Monday to outline his plans to stop violent crime in the US capital.\nIn another post on Sunday, he said the event at 10:00 EDT (14:00 GMT) would address ending \"crime, murder and death\" in the city, as well as its \"physical renovation\".\nHe described Bowser as \"a good person who has tried\", adding that despite the mayor's efforts, crime continued to get \"worse\" and the city was becoming \"dirtier and less attractive\".\nCommunity Partnership, an organisation that works to reduce homelessness in Washington DC, told Reuters that the city of 700,000 residents had about 3,782 people homeless on any given night.\nMost were in public housing or emergency shelters, but about 800 were considered to be \"on the street\".\nAs a district, rather than a state, Washington DC is overseen by the federal government, which has the power to override some local laws.\nThe president controls federal land and buildings in the city, although he would need Congress to assume federal control of the district.\nIn recent days, he has threatened to take over the Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department, which Bowser argued was not possible.\n\"There are very specific things in our law that would allow the president to have more control over our police department,\" Bowser said. \"None of those conditions exist in our city right now.\"\nTrump has been critical of various Democratic-run city administrations during his two presidential terms.\nIn recent months, he has notably clashed with the Los Angeles leadership after ordering thousands of National Guard members to deal with unrest over raids on undocumented migrants.\nThat deployment became the subject of a legal battle which will reach a federal court in California on Monday.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

      "text": "It's already tough enough to get a Labubu, but now they're going to get even more expensive.\nIn case you didn't know, President Donald Trump's tariff plan went into effect on Thursday after midnight. While the specifics are a bit complicated (there's a baseline 10% tariff on most products imported to the U.S., with most seeing an average of 17%), just know that this is the highest import taxes have been since the Great Depression, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab think tank.\nThat said, there are lot of products that are going to be impacted by this, especially toys being imported from China. This includes Labubus, which are manufactured by Pop Mart, a Chinese toy company based in Beijing.\nLabubus are already difficult to come by. It's practically impossible to get them from Pop Mart itself unless you somehow beat out everyone visiting the online storefront, or manage to make it to the front of the line at any of Pop Mart's physical stores. To increase your chances, you'll likely have to source your Labubu from a certified reseller like StockX (but beware of fake Lafufus).\nRight now, the average Labubu costs around $30 on Pop Mart (not including special edition ones), and resell for anywhere between $34\u2013$70 on StockX depending on the series. Shipping, taxes, and other fees will bring that price up some more, too.\nIt's unclear if StockX will reflect the impact from tariffs on their resell prices, but we will update this article when we have more information. It's also worth noting that you can find an official Pop Mart storefront on Amazon, which does sell Labubus.

This marks a dangerous escalation & risks deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians. It could further endanger more lives, including of the remaining hostages. I reiterate my urgent appeal for a permanent ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access across Gaza & the immediate & unconditional release of all hostages.\nIt follows the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, saying earlier today that \u201cthe Israeli government\u2019s plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza Strip must be immediately halted\u201d.\nIn a statement, T\u00fcrk said:\nIt runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the realisation of the agreed two-state solution and to the right of Palestinians to self-determination.\nThe plan triggered global condemnation, with China, Turkey, Britain and numerous Arab governments issuing statements of concern.\nIsrael\u2019s plan to take control of Gaza City marks \u201ca dangerous escalation\u201d that risks \u201cdeepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians\u201d, the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said.

The move is hugely significant from Germany, which believes it has a special responsibility towards Israel and is its second-largest arms supplier after the US.\nFrancejoined the chorus of countries including among others the UK, China, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, condemning the Israeli plan, saying it would \u201cworsen an already catastrophic situation without enabling the release of Hamas hostages, its disarmament, or its surrender\u201d. France\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a press release, condemning the plan \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d. It reads: \u201cThese actions would constitute further serious violations of international law and lead to an absolute stalemate. They would undermine the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to live in peace in a viable, sovereign, and contiguous state, and pose a threat to regional stability.\u201d The ministry added that Israel\u2019s plans would \u201cin no way\u201d contribute to the security of Israelis, including the remaining hostages in Gaza.

He told CNN today that an expanded military operation \u201cis not going to save the hostages, is going to cost the lives of many soldiers, and is going to cost the lives of many non-involved Palestinians\u201d.

There is no question about it.\nLast month, Olmerttold my colleague Emma Graham-Harrison that the so-called \u201chumanitarian city\u201d Israel\u2019s defence minister has proposed building on the ruins of Rafah would be a concentration camp, and forcing Palestinians inside would be ethnic cleansing.\nWe now have confirmation of AFP\u2019s report that the United Nations Security Council will indeed meet on Saturday, according to its schedule released today, after Israel\u2019s security cabinet approved a widely condemned plan to take control of Gaza City.\nAmbassador Riyad Mansour, permanent observer of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, had earlier said a number of countries would be requesting a meeting of the UN Security Council on Israel\u2019s plans.\nThe meeting will take place at 7pm GMT on Saturday, the schedule says.\n\u201cSo Israel is expected to surrender to Hamas & feed them even though Israeli hostages are being starved?\u201d Huckabee wrote on social media (repeating the un-evidenced Israeli government talking point that Hamas is stealing aid meant for civilians). He was responding to a post by Starmer calling for an immediate ceasefire and lamenting the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as well as the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages being held by Hamas.\nDid UK surrender to Nazis and drop food to them? Ever heard of Dresden, PM Starmer? That wasn\u2019t food you dropped. If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German!\nThe bombing of Dresden by the RAF and US air force in February 1945 is believed to have killed tens of thousands of civilians. It remains one of the most controversial allied acts of the second world war, amid questions marks over its strategic necessity and the widespread destruction in civilian areas.\nThese actions would constitute further serious violations of international law and lead to an absolute stalemate. They would undermine the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to live in peace in a viable, sovereign, and contiguous state, and pose a threat to regional stability.\nThe ministry added that Israel\u2019s plans would \u201cin no way\u201d contribute to the security of Israelis, including the remaining hostages in Gaza.\nThe future of Gaza should be through a \u201cframework of a future Palestinian state led by the Palestinian Authority\u201d, it said.\nIsrael occupying Gaza City would 'worsen an already catastrophic situation', says French foreign minister\nFrance has joined the chorus of countries strongly condemning Israel\u2019s plan to occupy Gaza City, saying it would \u201cworsen an already catastrophic situation without enabling the release of Hamas hostages, its disarmament, or its surrender\u201d.\nIn a post on X, the French foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, wrote:\nFrance strongly condemns the Israeli government\u2019s plan aimed at preparing for the complete occupation of Gaza. Such an operation would worsen an already catastrophic situation without enabling the release of Hamas hostages, its disarmament, or its surrender.\nUN Security Council meeting on Saturday over Israel\u2019s Gaza plan - report\nThe United Nations Security Council will meet in a rare weekend session on Saturday to discuss Israel\u2019s plan to take control of Gaza City, three diplomatic sources have told Agence France-Presse.\nThe meeting at 7pm GMT had been requested by several members of the security council, a member of the council told AFP, as global concern mounts over Israel\u2019s plan.\nUN chief calls Israeli plan to take control of Gaza City a 'dangerous escalation'\nUnited Nations secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has criticized Israel\u2019splan to take control of Gaza City, with the UN chief\u2019s spokesperson saying the decision marked \u201ca dangerous escalation\u201d that risks \u201cdeepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians\u201d.\nThat decision \u201cwill result in additional forced displacement, killings and massive destruction, compounding the unimaginable suffering of the Palestinian population in Gaza,\u201d the statement added.\nI\u2019m gravely alarmed by the decision of the Israeli Government to \u201ctake control of Gaza City\u201d. This marks a dangerous escalation & risks deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians. It could further endanger more lives, including of the remaining hostages. I reiterate my urgent appeal for a permanent ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access across Gaza & the immediate & unconditional release of all hostages.\nIt follows the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, saying earlier today that \u201cthe Israeli government\u2019s plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza Strip must be immediately halted\u201d.\nIn a statement, T\u00fcrk said:\nIt runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the realisation of the agreed two-state solution and to the right of Palestinians to self-determination.\nThe plan triggered global condemnation, with China, Turkey, Britain and numerous Arab governments issuing statements of concern.\nDisplaced repeatedly. Forced to live in tent camps or amid the ruins of their homes. Stricken by hunger and deprived of medical supplies.\nNow, 22 months into the war, around a million Palestinians are bracing for another catastrophe after the Israeli security cabinet\u2019s decision to take control of the entire Gaza Strip. Such an offensive would force them toward the south of the enclave, and an uncertain future.\n\u201cSince this morning, after hearing the news of evacuation of Gaza City, I have been been feeling anxious and afraid,\u2019\u2019 said Umm Ibrahim Banat, a 55-year-old mother, originally from northern Gaza, who has already been displaced four times. \u2018\u2018Where will we go with the children and the elderly? I swear we are exhausted from displacement, starvation, and being driven from one place to another.\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cWe are the walking dead.\u2019\u2019\nFollowing a 10-hour overnight meeting, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office announced on Friday that his security cabinet had approved a plan to take over Gaza City, marking another escalation of Israel\u2019s offensive that has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians.\nAccording to Israel\u2019s Channel 12 the plan, which would mean sending ground troops into the territory, could displace tens of thousands of people and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the territory and force approximately 1 million Palestinians in Gaza City and other areas into evacuation areas in the southern part of the enclave.\n\u201cGaza has been completely destroyed \u2013 what more can they do?\u201d, said Banat, whose daughter Maryam was killed with her husband and children. \u201cWe have lost the best of our youth; our territory is a huge prison besieged by land, sea, and air; the destruction has become unbearable; diseases are spreading, tents stretch as far as the eye can see, water is contaminated, prices are insane, hospitals are in ruins, our lives are utterly tragic! What more do they want?\u201d\nThe US and UK have \u201cdisagreements\u201d on Gaza including over whether to recognise a Palestinian state, JD Vance has suggested as he arrived in England for his summer holiday.\nThe US vice-president was speaking ahead of a bilateral meeting with David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, at his 17th-century grace-and-favour country house, Chevening.\nHis remarks on Gaza marked a note of discord in what otherwise appeared to be a convivial meeting between the two politicians, who have struck up an unlikely friendship. The pair have bonded over their Christian faith and difficult childhoods.\nBefore speaking to reporters on Friday afternoon, Lammy and Vance were filmed fishing for carp together in a pond near Chevening House. Expressing his love for the UK and describing Lammy as a \u201cgood friend\u201d and \u201cgracious host\u201d, Vance joked that their varying degrees of success in the carp pond was the \u201cone strain on the special relationship\u201d.\n\u201cAll of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not,\u201d he said."

      "text": "Why are Trump and Putin meeting in Alaska and when will it happen?\nThe US and Russia have agreed to hold a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin next Friday, to discuss ways forward to end the war in Ukraine.\nTrump announced the meeting last Friday, the same day of his self-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or else face more US sanctions.\nThree rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine held at Trump's behest this summer have yet to bring the two sides any closer to peace.\nHere is what we know about the meeting between the two leaders, taking place in Alaska - a former Russian territory which only became a US state in 1959.\nWhy are Putin and Trump meeting?\nTrump has been pushing hard - without much success - to end the war in Ukraine.\nAs a candidate, Trump pledged that he could end the war within 24 hours after taking office. He has also repeatedly claimed that the war \"never would have happened\" if he had been president at the time of Russia's invasion.\nLast month, Trump told the BBC that he was \"disappointed\" by Putin.\nFrustrations grew and Trump set a 8 August deadline for Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire or face more severe US sanctions.\nAs the deadline hit, Trump instead announced he and Putin would meet in person on 15 August.\nThe meeting comes after US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff held \"highly productive\" talks with Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, according to Trump.\nIs Ukraine attending the meeting?\nA White House official has said that Trump is willing to hold a trilateral meeting which would also include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nBut, for now, it remains a Trump-Putin summit, as initially requested by the Russian leader.\nIn response to the news of the Alaska summit, Zelensky has said any agreements without input from Kyiv will amount to \"dead decisions\".\nAnd on Friday, after Trump said there would need to \"be some swapping of territories\" in order for Moscow and Kyiv to reach an agreement, Zelensky spoke out on Telegram.\n\"We will not reward Russia for what it has perpetrated,\" Zelensky wrote. \"Any decisions against us, any decisions without Ukraine, are also decisions against peace.\"\nSpeaking to Fox New on Sunday, US Vice-President JD Vance suggested that Zelensky could join Putin and Trump for talks at a later date.\nBut for now, he said it would not be \"productive\" for Zelensky to meet Putin ahead of Trump's meeting with the Russian leader in Alaska.\n\"Fundamentally, the president of the United States has to be the one to bring these two together,\" he said.\nWhat do both sides hope to get out of it?\nThe US president claimed on Friday that a deal \"to stop the killing\" is \"very close\". He also has reportedly floated some thoughts on what may be necessary for both sides to agree to stop the fighting.\nWhile both Russia and Ukraine say they, too, want the war to end, both appear to want things that the other harshly opposes.\nUkraine has been adamant that it won't accept Russian control of regions it seized, most notably Crimea.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed the idea outright. \"There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution,\" he said.\nSo far, Putin has not budged from his territorial demands, Ukraine's neutrality and the future size of its army.\nRussia invaded the country, in part, over Putin's belief that Ukraine was becoming westernised and accused the Western defensive alliance, Nato, of using the country to gain a foothold to bring its troops closer to Russia's borders.\nThe Trump administration has been attempting to sway European leaders on a ceasefire deal that would hand over swathes of Ukrainian territory to Russia, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports.\nThe deal would allow Russia to keep control of the Crimean peninsula, and take the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk, according to sources familiar with the talks.\nRussia illegally occupied Crimea in 2014 and its forces control the majority of the Donbas region.\nUnder the deal, Russia would have to give up the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where it currently has some military control.\n\"There'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.\nVance, in his Fox interview, said any future deal is \"not going to make anybody super happy\".\n\"You've got to make peace here\u2026 you can't finger point,\" he said. \"The way to peace is to have a decisive leader to sit down and force people to come together.\"\nWhere will Trump and Putin meet?\nOn Friday evening, Trump posted on his social media site Truth Social that a \"highly anticipated meeting\" between him and Putin would take place on 15 August in the \"great state of Alaska\".\n\"Further details to follow,\" he said.\nTrump had said the meeting location would be \"a very popular one for a number of reasons\".\nThe exact location of their meeting in Alaska has not been released.\nWhy did they choose a US site?\nThe US purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, giving a historical significance to the meeting.\nRussian presidential assistant Yuri Ushakov said the location is \"quite logical\" and that both countries are neighbours, with the Bering Strait dividing them.\n\"It seems quite logical for our delegation simply to fly over the Bering Strait and for such an important and anticipated summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska.\"\nThe last time Alaska took centre stage in an American diplomatic event was in March 2021, when Joe Biden's newly minted diplomatic and national security team met their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage.\nThe sit-down turned acrimonious, with the Chinese accusing the Americans of \"condescension and hypocrisy\".\n- ANALYSIS: Why Trump-Putin relationship has soured\n- EXPLAINER: Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?\n- VISUALS: Tracking the war in maps\n- GLOBAL FALLOUT: How the global economy could be impacted\n- VERIFY: Russian attacks on Ukraine double since Trump inauguration\n- GROUND REPORT: On Ukraine's front line, twisted wreckage shows sanctions haven't yet stopped Russia"

      "text": "Israel rejects international criticism of Gaza City takeover plan\nIsrael has strongly rejected criticism from world leaders after its security cabinet approved a plan to take control of Gaza City.\nDefence Minister Israel Katz said countries that condemned Israel and threatened sanctions would \"not weaken our resolve\".\n\"Our enemies will find us as one strong, united fist that will strike them with great force,\" he added.\nIsrael's decision to expand its war in Gaza sparked condemnation from the UN and several countries including the UK, France and Canada, and prompted Germany to halt military exports to Israel.\nThe plan, approved by the Israeli security cabinet, lists five \"principles\" for ending the war: disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarising the Gaza Strip, taking security control of the territory, and establishing \"an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority\".\nReports in Israeli media say the plan initially focuses on taking full control of Gaza City, relocating its estimated one million residents further south. Forces would also take control of refugee camps in central Gaza and areas where hostages are thought to be held.\nA second offensive would follow weeks later in parallel with a boost in humanitarian aid, media say.\nThe move to escalate the conflict has drawn fierce opposition from some within Israel, including from military officials and the families of hostages being held in Gaza.\nHamas has said the plan to occupy Gaza City \"constitutes a new war crime\" and will \"cost [Israel] dearly\".\nOn Friday, foreign ministers from the UK, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Australia released a joint statement rejecting the plan, saying it would \"aggravate\" the already \"catastrophic\" situation in Gaza.\n\"Any attempts at annexation or of settlement extension violate international law,\" they added.\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk warned that further escalation would \"result in more massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction and atrocity crimes\".\nIn other reaction:\n- UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the move \"wrong\", saying it would \"only bring more bloodshed\"\n- Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged Israel \"not to go down this path\", saying it would \"only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza\"\n- Turkey's foreign ministry urged the world community to prevent Israel's plan which aimed to \"forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land\"\n- In China, a foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP news agency: \"Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory\".\nNetanyahu told German Chancellor Friedrich Merz he was disappointed with Berlin's decision to suspend arms exports to Israel, saying it was \"rewarding Hamas terrorism\".\nIn Israel itself, families of the remaining hostages in Gaza have warned that the lives of the 20 believed to have survived will be put in peril.\nThe Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said the decision was leading \"toward a colossal catastrophe for both the hostages and our soldiers\".\nThe US has been less critical. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said it was \"pretty much up to Israel\" whether to fully occupy the Gaza Strip.\nThe IDF currently controls about three-quarters of Gaza, and almost all of its 2.1 million citizens are situated in the quarter of the territory that the military does not control.\nThe UN estimates some 87% of Gaza is either in militarised zones or under evacuation orders.\nThere are areas in central Gaza and along the Mediterranean coast that Israel does not occupy, according to the UN.\nThese include refugee camps, where much of Gaza's population is now living after their homes were destroyed by Israel's military action.\nThe vast majority of Gaza's population has already been displaced by the war, many people several times over.\nThe war has created a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, most of which UN-backed experts say is at the point of famine.\nThe territory is also experiencing mass deprivation as a result of heavy restrictions imposed by Israel on what is allowed in - something it says is aimed at weakening Hamas.\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said July was the worst month for cases of acute malnutrition in children in Gaza, affecting nearly 12,000 under the age of five.\nThe war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed at least 61,158 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry."

Police updated their earlier totals and said 522 people were arrested for supporting a proscribed organization in violation of anti-terror laws. Another 10 people were arrested on a variety of charges, including assaulting and obstructing police officers.\nBackers of Palestine Action staged the protest to underscore their belief that the government is illegally restricting freedom of expression by banning a direct action organization that has challenged its policies.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper, who oversees law enforcement in Britain, rejected that characterization, saying Palestine Action was banned after committing serious attacks involving violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage.\n\u201cThe right to protest is one we protect fiercely but this is very different from displaying support for this one specific and narrow, proscribed organization,\u201d Cooper said in a statement. \u201cMany people may not yet know the reality of this organization, but the assessments are very clear, this is not a nonviolent organization,\u201d she added.\nPolice released updated information on the Palestine Action protest after the front pages of Sunday newspapers featured photos of elderly protesters being carted off by officers.\nOne of those was La Pethick, an 89-year-old retired psychotherapist, who told the Times of London that she had the support of her five grandchildren. \u201cWe are having our right to peaceful protest being taken away,\u201d she said.\nAlmost half of those arrested were over the age of 60, according to figures released by the Met.\nPolice said the process of deciding whether to file charges against those arrested is likely to take weeks as officers from the Met\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command put together case files and seek approval from prosecutors, and in some cases the attorney general.\nParliament voted to ban Palestine Action after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and damaged two tanker planes to protest British support for the war in Gaza.

      "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came under pressure from all sides Sunday as his controversial plan for a new offensive in the Gaza Strip drew backlash at home and internationally, while malnutrition deaths in the Palestinian enclave continued to climb.\nThe proposed military offensive, which the Israeli government announced Friday, has been widely condemned by critics who say it is likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and further endanger the hostages still being held by Hamas.\nAt a news conference, a defiant Netanyahu continued to deny there is starvation in Gaza and claimed the situation is being exaggerated. He conceded there was \u201cdeprivation\u201d in Gaza, but said \u201cno one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war\u201d if Israel was implementing a \u201cstarvation policy.\u201d\nHe went on to defend the proposed Gaza takeover, saying Israel had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfinish the job\u201d and \u201cdefeat Hamas,\u201d while claiming that \u201chundreds of aid trucks have gone into Gaza.\u201d\nNetanyahu said his goal was to rescue the remaining hostages and recover the remains of those who had died. Of the 50 hostages still being held by Hamas, Israel believes about 20 are alive.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, we are not going to get them out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe move I\u2019m talking about has the possibility of getting them out.\u201d\nNetanyahu\u2019s remarks came as the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss Israel\u2019s proposed offensive. The United States said at the meeting that Israel had the right to defend itself and to decide what is necessary for its security.\nThe plan was condemned by other Western governments, as well as U.N. officials who said it would only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been limited since Israel lifted a 2\u00bd-month blockade in May.\n\u201cThis is no longer a looming hunger crisis \u2014 this is starvation, pure and simple,\u201d a U.N. humanitarian coordination official, Ramesh Rajasingham, told the council.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that five more people, including two children, had died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 217, including 100 children.\nThe U.N. and other international organizations say the humanitarian aid arriving in Gaza through airdrops and on a small number of trucks is far from sufficient to feed the enclave\u2019s population of 2 million people.\nOn Saturday, a 14-year-old boy named Muhannad Eid died after being struck by an aid package that was airdropped over Gaza, his brother, Muhammad Eid, said.\n\u201cThis is an aerial humiliation, not aid,\u201d Muhammad Eid said. \u201cWe need protection. We want international protection.\u201d\nWith the latest death, 23 people have now been killed during aid drops since the Israel-Hamas war began 22 months ago, according to the Gaza government media office.\n\u201cWe have repeatedly warned of the danger of these inhumane methods and have repeatedly called for the safe and adequate entry of aid through land crossings,\u201d it said in a statement.\nAccording to local health officials, more than 61,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, have been killed since Israel began its military campaign Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel. During that attack, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.\nThere is strong opposition in Israel to the expansion of Gaza military operations, with thousands of people calling for an immediate ceasefire at protests Saturday night in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities.\nBut for some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government, the plan isn\u2019t tough enough.\nForeign Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has pushed for Israel to impose sovereignty over Gaza, called it a \u201cfoolish\u201d half-measure, saying in a video message Saturday night that he did not support it.\nSmotrich said the proposed offensive was intended to pressure Hamas into agreeing to a temporary ceasefire, and that instead Israel needed a \u201csharp, clear path\u201d to victory over Hamas.\nThe dissatisfaction expressed by Smotrich, who said he had \u201clost faith\u201d in the prime minister, threatens to destabilize Netanyahu\u2019s fragile coalition.\nIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid seized on the opportunity, calling on Smotrich to join him in advancing a bill to dissolve parliament and hold new elections.\n\u201cIn your own words, you admitted that the prime minister\u2019s policy is not leading to a decisive outcome in Gaza, is not returning our hostages, and is not winning the war,\u201d Lapid said in a statement, according to the Times of Israel. \u201cYou also added that you can no longer stand behind the prime minister and back him up.\u201d\nThe plan outlines five goals for ending the war: Disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing Gaza, taking security control of the area, and establishing \u201can alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\u201d\nThose preparations are expected to take weeks or months, a delay that hard-liners in the Israeli government fear could leave room for a diplomatic solution that would undermine their objectives.\nExperts have questioned whether the plan would protect Israelis, or work at all.\nMichael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University\u2019s Dayan Center, said it was full of \u201chollow slogans.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a very common slogan: \u2018We will release the hostages and defeat Hamas at the same time,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do both simultaneously. Hamas will execute them, or the IDF itself could in the bombing.\u201d\nThere are also questions as to who would run Gaza long term. Netanyahu said he intends to hand control of the territory to \u201cArab forces,\u201d adding Sunday that \u201cseveral candidates\u201d are being looked at for the establishment of a new \u201ctransitional authority.\u201d\nHe has not specified who that could be, aside from saying it would not be Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.\n\u201cThat leaves nobody,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cNo Arab country is going to be Israel\u2019s enforcer on the ground.\u201d"
