  "title": "Nvidia dominates AMD with 94% of desktop GPU market",
  "description": "AMD's already-small share of the market shrinks further, down from 12% to 6% in just one year, according to analysis.",
  "content": "Things are looking grim in the graphics card market, unless your name is Nvidia. Already a dominant force, and riding high on industrial sales through both the crypto craze and the AI boom, a research firm now says Nvidia has 94 percent of the add-in-board market as of the close of the second quarter 2025. AMD has just six percent, and Intel comes in with effectively zero presence.\n\nAccording to Jon Peddie Research, AMD is continuing a slide downwards, going from 12 percent of discrete desktop GPUs at the end of Q2 2024, to eight percent in Q1 of this year, to six today. Nvidia\u2019s monopoly on graphics cards is no longer theoretical, it\u2019s inarguable. And it doesn\u2019t look like the trends will be reversing anytime soon, as all of this has happened while AMD was releasing new consumer and pro-level cards at competitive prices to counter Nvidia\u2019s moves.\n\nKeep in mind that these numbers are specifically for desktop PCs with add-in boards, not counting those relying on integrated graphics (which is a big chunk of them, and basically all smaller designs like \u201cmini PCs\u201d). The only good news if you\u2019re trying to get one of those highly in-demand RTX 50-series cards is that at least some of them seem to be available at retail prices after half a year of waiting.\n\nAMD is doing better on the CPU side of things, as PC Gamer notes. Jon Peddie also reported that AMD gained ground against Intel, with big blue dropping from 76 percent of the market in Q2 2024 to 67 percent at the end of Q2 2025. Strong performance from Ryzen chips, both with laptops that take advantage of its powerful integrated graphics and on the desktop with the cache-boosted X3D series, is helping out a lot.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not all doom and gloom, as AMD reports strong demand for its newest Radeon cards. It could be simply from the rising graphics card market (up 27 percent just this quarter, according to the same reports). But without a pretty major shift \u2014 say, expanding ROCm support to Windows? \u2014 it seems like AMD is destined to remain a secondary player in graphics cards for the time being.",

      "text": "You might not have heard about AMD\u2019s ROCm. It (unofficially) stands for Radeon Open Compute PlatforM\u2014a pretty terrible acronym\u2014and it\u2019s pronounced \u201crock \u2019em.\u201d This is a way for programs to take advantage of the computing power in a graphics card instead of a CPU. Think of it as a software accelerator, sort of like AMD\u2019s version of Nvidia CUDA. And it\u2019s about to become a lot more relevant.\nPCWorld contributor Will Smith got to speak with Andrej Zdravkovic, Senior Vice President of GPU Technologies at AMD. While ROCm is mostly relevant for large-scale \u201cbig iron\u201d enterprise applications right now, the latest changes are making it more relevant for regular Windows users.\nHow so? Well, the new HIP (Heterogeneous Interface for Portability) SDK. It\u2019s a bit of special sauce that lets programs designed to use CUDA and similar systems tap into ROCm\u2019s power to leverage Radeon graphics cards. And it has the potential to be a huge game-changer. Basically, any local program that needs extra power\u2014from AI applications to rendering to file processing and beyond\u2014can benefit from this, with only small tweaks needed to get existing code up and running in most cases.\nCheck out the full video interview above for the technical ins and outs.

      "text": "AMD's PC graphics card market share falls to a worrying 6% according to the latest analyst data putting Nvidia at 94% and probably an all-time high\nBut AMD has taken a big chunk out of Intel in CPUs.\nAMD is barely manufacturing any RDNA 4-based graphics cards. It's hard to avoid that conclusion if the latest data from long-time PC market data analyst JPR is correct. JPR reckons that AMD's share of the add-in graphics card market has fallen to a miserable 6%, leaving Nvidia with the remaining 94% of the market.\nThere's much better news for AMD when it comes to CPUs. But let's deal with the GPU disaster first. According to JPR, AMD had 12% of the PC graphics card market a year ago. That share has been sliced in half to just 6% for the second quarter of 2025. And that despite AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs going on sale in March and thus being available throughout the entirety of the quarter.\nNvidia is really the only other player in PC graphics cards right now, with sales of Intel's Arc GPUs seemingly nearly non-existent. So, the remaining 94%, yes fully 94%, of the market is owned by Nvidia. Scary, and very likely an all-time record for Nvidia.\nOh, and just for completeness, JPR says AMD's graphics card share fell from 8% to 6% from the first to second quarter this year. So, the first full quarter of RDNA 4 being available saw AMD's market share actually fall. Help!\nSo, is there any spin you can put on these numbers than pure doom for AMD ? Just possibly. While RDNA 4 has indeed been available throughout the quarter, that only applies to the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT. These are quite expensive GPUs even at their respective $549 and $599 MSRPs. But they've actually been selling for well above those prices.\nIn short, the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT aren't outright mainstream GPUs that you'd expect to sell in really big numbers. Those would be the RX 9060 and RX 9060 XT, and they've only gone on sale much more recently and haven't had a chance to show up in the data for the most recent quarter.\nIn the meantime, sales of AMD's previous-gen mainstream GPUs might have fallen off in Q2 in preparation for the arrival of cheaper RDNA 4 GPUs. Ultimately, then, we'll have to wait for Q3's figures for an idea of how well those more affordable RDNA GPUs are doing. At that point, it will be pretty much impossible to make excuses if the numbers are bad.\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nAll that said, AMD itself has said that demand for RDNA 4 has been unprecedented and it's certainly true that both the 9070 and 9070 XT remain above MSRP. So, as we mentioned when noting RDNA 4's absence from the latest Steam PC hardware survey, that implies AMD really hasn't made many 9070 and 9070 XT GPUs at all. Demand is clearly outstripping supply, but the cards just aren't showing up in third-party data, be that Steam or JPR's analysis.\nWhat we're getting at here, to be clear, is that there's no way AMD can make a dent in Nvidia's market share if it's only producing a very small number of GPUs. Anyway, if that all sounds catastrophic, AMD is going gang busters in CPUs and all at the expense of Intel.\nFor the second quarter of 2025, JPR reckons that Intel's client CPU market share in PCs and laptops, not servers and data centers, has fallen to 67% from 71% in the previous quarter and 76% in the second quarter of 2024. So, Intel is nearly 10% down in just one year. Ouch.\nJPR doesn't explicitly say so, but its numbers appear to be purely for x86-based CPUs, as AMD is the only other player and the likes of Qualcomm with its Arm CPUs do not figure. Thus AMD's market share in Q2 2024 was 24%, rising to 33% in the most recent quarter.\nOverall, that makes for the usual mixed picture from AMD. Killing it in CPUs, being killed in GPUs. In the end, all we can say for sure is that AMD's GPU market share can't really get much worse. It's already teetering on the edge of oblivion. Here's hoping this is one heck of a lull before a storm of RX 9060 and 9060 XT sales data arrives next quarter.\n\ud83d\udc49Check out our list of guides\ud83d\udc48\n1.

      "text": "TIBURON, CA (September 2, 2025)\u2014According to a new research report from the analyst firm Jon Peddie Research, the growth of the global PC-based graphics add-in board market reached 11.6 million units in Q2\u201925 and desktop PC CPU shipments increased to 21.7 million units.\nOverall, AIBs will have a compound annual growth rate of -5.4% from 2024 to 2028 and will reach an installed base of 163 million units by the end of the forecast period. Over the next five years, the penetration of AIBs in desktop PCs will be 87%.\nFigure 1. AIB shipments for the quarter increased by 27.0% and increased by 22.2% yr-yr.\nAs indicated in the following chart, AMD\u2019s overall AIB market share decreased by -2.1% from last quarter, Intel\u2019s market share stayed at 0.0%, and Nvidia\u2019s market share increased by 2.1%.\nFigure 2. Quarterly AIB market share percentages.\n\u201cAIB prices dropped for midrange and entry-level, while high-end AIB prices increased, and most retail suppliers ran out of stock. This is very unusual for the second quarter,\u201d said Dr. Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research. \u201cWe think it is a continuation of higher prices expected due to the tariffs and buyers trying to get ahead of that.\u201d\n\u2022 The AIB overall attach rate in desktop PCs for the quarter increased to 154%, up 2.3% from last quarter.\n\u2022 The desktop PC CPU market decreased -4.4% year to year, and increased 21.6% quarter to quarter.\nFigure 3. Attach rate.\nThe second quarter is traditionally down from the previous quarter. This quarter\u2019s GPU shipments were up from the 10-year average of 5.7%.\nAMD\u2019s RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 represent AMD\u2019s new RDNA 4 architecture, competing with Nvidia\u2019s midrange offerings. Nvidia introduced two new Blackwell-series AIBs: the GeForce RTX 5080 Super and the RTX 5070. The company also announced the RTX 500 workstation AIB. Rumors have persisted about two new AIBs from Intel, including a dual-GPU model.\nPricing and availability\nJon Peddie Research\u2019s AIB report is now available and sells for $3,000.

      "text": "It\u2019s been seven months since Nvidia launched its flagship RTX 5090 card to a hungry audience of PC gamers\u2026 and people building AI data centers\u2026 and a bunch of scalpers trying to bilk them all. In that time, I\u2019ve yet to see one actually available to purchase at the alleged base price of two thousand dollarydoos. Until now! As of just before 11 AM Eastern US time, Newegg has one for the base price.\nSpecifically this one, the Zotac Gaming Solid model, a basic triple-fan design which apparently has the reference PCB with no overclock. As the good Lord intended. It comes with a free copy of the upcoming Borderlands 4, all the better to show off your PC\u2019s upgraded gaming prowess, which is the latest promotional tie-in via Nvidia.\nThe presence of an elusive RTX 50-series card with no markups from AIB partners or retailers was spotted by posters on SlickDeals, who also found a $1,000 Asus RTX 5080 on Amazon. That one\u2019s a \u201climited time deal\u201d that\u2019s reserved for Prime members (and I\u2019m seeing it pop in and out with another price at $1,117, so don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s gone by the time you\u2019re reading this).\nIs the drought of availability for these in-demand graphics cards\u2014or at least the availability of cards at the price Nvidia announced for them\u2014finally coming to a close? It seems possible. Eight months could be enough time for Nvidia to get its act together in terms of producing these things with its fabrication partners. Nvidia recently lowered the price of some RTX 50-series cards in Europe, though that appears to be a correction for the rising value of the Euro versus the US dollar as the American economy gets pummeled by tariffs. But conventional wisdom and basic supply and demand say it\u2019s not something Nvidia would do if it was selling every single card it could make.\nJust on a whim, I decided to find the lowest price I could on the highly desirable Nvidia Founder\u2019s Edition cards for the RTX 5090 (unattainable for me). It was going for $2,350 on StockX and $2,500 on eBay, still a 17-25 percent markup, both on secondary markets. Cheaper cards (relative term here) like the 5070 and 5070 Ti seem to be in much higher demand, and still have markups at higher percentages.\nStill, it seems like the situation is improving from the near hopeless pursuits of these graphics cards earlier in the year, and a bit faster than I was expecting. Happy hunting, PC gamers\u2026 and [extended censored BLEEP] to you, scalpers."

      "text": "When it comes to desktop graphics cards, Nvidia rules the roost even while gamers complain of rising prices and lowering value. According to a research firm, Big Green has more than 90 percent of the market captured after a precipitous fall from rival AMD, as of the first quarter of 2025. By many definitions, Nvidia is now approaching (or has even surpassed) monopoly status for desktop GPUs.\nThe new data comes from Jon Peddie Research, which gives Nvidia 92 percent of the desktop graphics market share for the quarter ending in March. Despite making gains in Q4 2024, AMD dropped from 15 percent down to 8 percent, finishing even lower than its Q1 representation from last year. Things are just as grim for Intel, who\u2019s fighting for any kind of market space with its Arc discrete cards as they now sit at zero percent (or at least below the 0.1 percent shown in Q1 2024).\nGiving context to the numbers hardly makes things better. Tom\u2019s Hardware notes that Nvidia and AMD introduced new consumer graphics card designs in the first quarter of 2025, but it appears that demand for Nvidia\u2019s cards far outstripped supply, with prices still elevated well beyond retail prices. The bigger story might be the boom in the \u201cAI\u201d market, as established corporate entities and startups scramble to fill data centers with GPUs to extend their capacity for generative AI services.\nJon Peddie Research notes that desktop PC CPU sales decreased in the same timeframe, almost 15 percent year-to-year and over 20 percent quarter-to-quarter. That\u2019s raining on AMD\u2019s parade a bit, as they\u2019ve been making big gains with new CPU products, especially in the gaming space with its much-loved X3D line designed for gamers and media producers.\nExtending the outlook beyond desktop PCs makes things a little less bleak for AMD. The latest Steam hardware survey shows AMD making slow but steady progress versus Nvidia in terms of graphics representation, up to 17.6 percent as of May. But a couple of caveats. As a survey of PC gamers, Steam tends to skew towards consumers and power users, and the broad \u201cvideo card\u201d category includes desktops and laptops plus integrated graphics, so AMD\u2019s APU systems (like the chip inside the Steam Deck and many other PC gaming handhelds) get more representation from this set of data.\nIt\u2019s possible that AMD could see progress in the second quarter, which closes out at the end of June. The Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT plus RX 9060 XT all represent superior value versus their Nvidia counterparts, and they seem to be far more readily available to actually buy (though still pretty difficult if you want to find one at retail price). And AMD continues to dominate for enthusiast CPUs on the desktop and low-power, efficient graphics on laptops and handhelds. But it doesn\u2019t look like Nvidia\u2019s dominance is set to change anytime soon."
