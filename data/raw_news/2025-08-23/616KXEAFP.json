  "description": "Assembling economic data is a continuous process, dependent on information that\u2019s sometimes incomplete or late in arriving, which can lead to dramatic corrections as happened in the US a few weeks ago. Another such shift happened in Nigeria last month when it was announced that the nation\u2019s gross domestic product was suddenly more than 30% bigger.",
  "content": "Assembling economic data is a continuous process, dependent on information that\u2019s sometimes incomplete or late in arriving, which can lead to dramatic corrections as happened in the US a few weeks ago. Another such shift happened in Nigeria last month when it was announced that the nation\u2019s gross domestic product was suddenly more than 30% bigger.\n\nGathering figures for an emerging or frontier market isn\u2019t straightforward \u2014 particularly given how much activity occurs outside the formal part of the economy that features salaried workers. Arguably, the revised look at Nigeria offers a more accurate picture. It remains the fourth-largest economy on the African continent, having lost its status as No. 1 two years ago, when President Bola Tinubu endorsed a more realistic exchange rate by letting the naira float more freely.",
