  "title": "10 Things Your Smartphone Camera Can Do\u2014Completely Unrelated to Photography",
  "description": "Your phone\u2019s camera can moonlight as your personal assistant, if you allow it.",
  "content": "Your smartphone camera is good for far more than snapping yet another overly flattering shot of your lunch. It's a surprisingly powerful tool that can make your day-to-day life easier, more efficient, and occasionally even safer.\n\nScan Documents and Convert Them to PDFs\n\nGone are the days when scanning meant hunting down a bulky office machine. Your phone's camera can turn any piece of paper into a neatly cropped, shareable digital file in seconds\u2014and the app you need for the job is already built in.\n\niPhones have this functionality tucked into the Notes app, while Android users can use Google Drive or other preloaded tools. Good dedicated mobile scanner apps like Adobe Scan and CamScanner go even further, allowing you to enhance the text, straighten pages, and more.\n\nThis is particularly handy when you need to send a signed form, digitize a receipt for expense claims, or archive important documents without worrying about them getting lost or damaged.\n\nIf you're in a foreign country and staring at a menu you can't read, or you've just unboxed something with instructions written in a language you don't speak, your camera can step in as a pocket translator.\n\nWith tools like Google Lens (also accessible through the Google app, Google Photos, or Chrome), Apple's Live Text, and a growing cast of similar apps for live text translation, you can point your camera at just about anything. Try aiming at menus, street signs, or even someone's messy handwriting, and watch the translated words appear right on your screen as if they were always there.\n\nYour measuring tape might be buried in a drawer somewhere and not always within reach, but your smartphone camera can measure distances using augmented reality. Apple's Measure app and Android equivalent apps, like AR Ruler, can estimate lengths, heights, and even room dimensions by scanning the environment.\n\nIt's perfect for quick home improvement tasks, like checking if a couch will fit through the doorway, measuring a wall before buying paint, or estimating the height of a plant. The results may not always be accurate to the millimeter, but they're often close enough for everyday purposes.\n\nIf you're curious about the flower growing in your backyard or the bird that landed on your balcony, your camera can help you find out.\n\nApps like Seek by iNaturalist, Google Lens, and iOS's built-in Visual Look Up feature can identify plants, animals, insects, and even landmarks. To use them, just snap a photo or point your camera at them in real time. Interestingly, a few of these free apps can even help you sharpen your nature photography game while you\u2019re at it.\n\nBeyond satisfying curiosity, this can be practical. Try using it to identify potentially harmful plants, figure out which vegetables are safe to eat, or learn more about the history of a monument you stumble upon while exploring.\n\nScanning QR codes has become second nature for many of us, letting you do everything from pulling up a restaurant menu to connecting to Wi-Fi to making a quick payment. Your smartphone camera can handle it without any special app by opening the camera, pointing, and tapping the link that pops up.\n\nMany shopping apps also let you scan product barcodes right from your camera to compare prices, read reviews, or check stock availability. If you want extra features, dedicated QR code and barcode scanner apps can save codes for later, keep a history of scans, or even generate your own QR codes for sharing contact details or event links.\n\nHelp With Math and Homework\n\nStruggling with a math problem? Your camera can turn into an on-demand tutor. Apps like Photomath let you scan equations\u2014handwritten or printed\u2014and then walk you through the steps to solve them.\n\nThis can be a lifesaver if you are a student working through tricky homework (or an adult trying to help without having to dust off long-forgotten algebra skills). It's also useful for quick calculations in everyday life, like figuring out percentages on a sale item or converting measurements for a recipe.\n\nYou can turn your smartphone camera into a mini health monitor. By placing your fingertip over the rear camera, apps for tracking your health metrics, like Instant Heart Rate or Cardiio, can detect your pulse through changes in skin color caused by blood flow.\n\nWhile these shouldn't replace professional medical devices, they can provide quick check-ins for fitness tracking, stress monitoring, or general wellness.\n\nYour camera can breathe new life into old photo albums. Instead of taking a plain snapshot of a printed picture, apps like Google PhotoScan and Photomyne use multiple captures and smart processing to remove glare, enhance colors, and straighten images.\n\nDigitizing old family photos protects them from fading, water damage, or accidental loss. Plus, they're easier to share with relatives or back up to the cloud.\n\nSmartphone cameras can be vital accessibility tools for people with visual impairments. Apps like Be My Eyes, Sullivan+, and Lookout use the camera to describe surroundings, read text aloud, and even recognize currency.\n\nBe My Eyes, for example, connects its users to volunteers who can describe what the camera sees in real time. This can help with everything from reading labels at the supermarket to navigating unfamiliar environments. It's one of the most powerful examples of how camera technology can improve everyday life beyond entertainment.\n\nDownload: Be My Eyes for Android | iOS (Free)\n\nAugmented reality (AR) overlays digital objects onto your real surroundings, and your phone's camera is the window that makes it happen. Games like Pok\u00e9mon GO blend virtual creatures with your actual environment, while AR filters on social apps let you try on sunglasses, swap your hair color, or drop yourself into a fantasy backdrop\u2014all in real time.\n\nWith AR-enabled apps like IKEA or Wayfair (with its View in Room 3D feature), you can also preview how new furniture will look in your living room before buying it.\n\nTo get the most out of AR, check if your phone supports ARCore (Android) or ARKit (iOS), as these determine which experiences will work smoothly. Keep your camera lens clean, make sure there's decent lighting, and give the app some space to scan your surroundings. AR works best when it understands the environment.\n\nThe more you explore these features, the more you realize this part of your smartphone is less of a camera and more of a pocket-sized problem solver. It's often much faster than typing or even using your voice.",

If you feel generous or have a couple of minutes, please leave a review. It makes a huge difference to us. Thank you in advance.\nRatings and Reviews\nEditors\u2019 Choice\nThere\u2019s a special place in the App Store\u2019s heart for altruistic apps, and Be My Eyes is an instantly effective example of one. It connects people who are blind or who have low vision with sighted volunteers who can help with day-to-day tasks. You\u2019ll choose whether you\u2019d like to join the thousands of people receiving assistance or the millions of volunteers providing it. Both parties will select their preferred language(s), and video calls can be initiated with a tap.\nI am a volunteer and it brightens up my day!\nI love answering calls because it humbles me that low vision or blind people go through a lot of extra work just to get through daily life. And to be able to make it easier for them means the world to me. It ALWAYS makes me smile even if I\u2019m having a bad day by helping. Everyone is so grateful and wonderful to work with. I even helped out a man with narrowed vision who voluntarily goes out and helps homeless people and needed help reading a SUPER small print sheet that had all the resources for people in need. He just needed to find the one for housing to help people get back on their feet. Not only are they giving back and volunteering, but I felt a part of it at the same time because I was able to help him find the resources he needed so he could give out to those he helps who are homeless. Someone with a disability giving back in the way they receive help themselves is the definition of giving forward. And I just think this is Suh an amazing app, with amazing people all over the world. I can\u2019t want until my next call to help out someone new. Now if I could also meet them, that would just mean the world to me to meet these incredible people. They inspire me.\nInconsistently handles personal information\nI would love to give this app, a higher rating and I would have except that it\u2019s recent behavior is frustrating. I use the app mainly for reading mail. Occasionally, it will tell me that it can\u2019t read the recipients name or address, because it is not supposed to disclose information from an image. To me, that kind of defeats, the purpose of using the app for reading mail as a blind person. yet, other times, it will read the mail, including giving me the name and recipients address. So the inconsistent application of this rule is confusing. But ultimately, the real frustration is that it applies this rule in the first place, meaning that I can\u2019t always use this app, because I have to switch to another app to read the image. In other respects, though, Be My Eyes is wonderful at describing images and scenes. when I sent a message about being frustrated, with the fact that it wouldn\u2019t disclose this information, it responded that I could cover the personal information with the piece of paper and that way it wouldn\u2019t reveal such information. This implied then that it would reveal all the information if I didn\u2019t cover the page, but that wasn\u2019t the case. since this behavior just started in the last month, I\u2019m presuming that it might be a response related to how the European Union wants Apple to handle images. So, this is why I\u2019ve rated the app reluctantly as a three star rating.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, Be My Eyes, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

      "text": "Look around the room you're in. You will find at least a dozen products with a barcode on them. Every product sold comes with a unique identifier. You can scan these codes using a barcode scanner app and find the associated product on the web.\nYou can also use it to make online payments and check menus since many bars and restaurants today are switching to QR codes. Many businesses use QR codes so people can quickly go to their site without having to type the URL. Knowing this, here's a curated list of the best barcode scanner apps for Android and iOS.\n1. Google Lens\nDid you know you scan barcodes in the Google Lens app? Just point the search frame to a barcode or a QR code, and let the app do its thing. The upside of using Google Lens is that there are a lot of interesting things you can do with Google Lens.\nYou can copy or translate text, identify plants, find similar products, and a lot more. Lens is part of the Google app on iPhones, so you won't need a separate app for scanning QR codes. Overall, Google Lens is one of the best barcode scanner apps for Android and iOS.\nDownload: Google Lens for Android (Free)\nDownload: Google for iOS (Free)\n2. Orca Scan\nOrca Scan isn't a run-of-the-mill barcode scanner; you can use it as an alternative to hardware scanners. Orca Scan can track an entire inventory without any specialized software.\nThe app won't redirect you to the web when scanning a barcode. Instead, it will ask you to fill in details about the product for asset tracking. The app has a web-based spreadsheet where all the data gets synced.\nOf course, you can export the database in the form of a spreadsheet or a JSON file. If you want a free alternative to expensive barcode scanning solutions, Orca Scan is the best barcode scanner for you.\nDownload: Orca Scan for Android | iOS (Free)\n3. SecScanQR\nIf you are looking for a privacy-focused option, then you need to take a look at SecScanQR.\nIt's an open-source app only available for Android via the F-Droid store. It allows scanning multiple types of barcodes and QR codes, and you can decide which search engine should open the link. Choose DuckDuckGo if you want to steer clear of web tracking.\nOn top of barcode scanning, SecScanQR can generate different types of barcodes or QR codes. You can create a location QR code, a contact QR code, or even a simple text QR code. It even has a night mode; a pretty sweet deal for an open-source app.\nDownload: SecScanQR for Android (Free)\n4. Goodreads\nGoodreads is an excellent book-tracking app that can organize your out-of-control reading list, and give you book recommendations. An underlying feature of Goodreads is that you can use its barcode scanner to add books to your reading list.\nLet's say you are at a bookstore or a library. You can scan the book cover with the app, add it to your read-later section, or check its reviews online. With the Goodreads scanner, you can quickly add a bunch of books and decide whether to keep them on your reading list later on.\nGoodreads is only for avid readers. If you are looking for a proper QR scanner app then check out other apps on this list.\nDownload: Goodreads for Android | iOS (Free)\n5. QRbot\nQRbot can scan all the common barcode formats and QR codes and supports barcode scanning from photos. You can use the search shortcuts such as \"Search it on Amazon\" which will redirect you to the product's listing on the Amazon app or website.\nThe barcode scanner app allows creating codes, but the best part is you can design QR codes. For instance, you can change the design or add your own image in your QR code, although this feature is only available on the iOS app. Moreover, most of the design templates are exclusive to paid users.\nDownload: QRbot for Android | iOS (Free, in-app purchases available)\n6. Open Food Facts\nReading food labels is a good idea if you are conscious of what you consume. But they can be tricky to read and sometimes difficult to make sense of. That's where you can take the help of Open Food Facts (OFF), a food database where you can get a nutritional score of the food that you are planning to eat.\nYou can use the barcode scanner in the Open Food Facts app to find nutritional facts about food items. If the information is not available, feel free to add it to the database yourself.

      "text": "Switch color mode\nHome Community News Introducing Be My AI (formerly Virtual Volunteer) for People who are Blind or Have Low Vision, Powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4\nMarch 14, 2023\nOur mission is to make the world more accessible for people who are blind or have low vision. Since our founding in 2015, Be My Eyes has worked to connect our 6.3 million volunteers to users to assist them with everyday tasks. Our new Virtual Volunteer tool, currently in beta testing, will push us further toward achieving our goal to improve accessibility, usability, and access to information globally, and aligns us with OpenAI\u2019s stated principles on developing safe and responsible AI.\nThis technology will be transformative in providing people who are blind or have low vision with powerful new resources to better navigate physical environments, address everyday needs, and gain more independence.\nThe Virtual Volunteer feature from Be My Eyes will be integrated into the existing app and is powered by OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4 language model, which contains a dynamic new image-to-text generator. Users can send images via the app to an AI-powered Virtual Volunteer, which will answer any question about that image and provide instantaneous visual assistance for a wide variety of tasks.\nWhat sets the Virtual Volunteer tool apart from other image-to-text technology available today is context, with a deeper level of understanding and conversational ability not yet seen in the digital assistant field. For example, if a user sends a picture of the inside of their refrigerator, the Virtual Volunteer will not only be able to correctly identify what\u2019s in it, but also extrapolate and analyze what can be prepared with those ingredients. The tool can also then offer a number of recipes for those ingredients and send a step-by-step guide on how to make them.\nIf and when the tool is unable to answer a question, it will automatically offer users the option to be connected via the app to a sighted volunteer for assistance \u2013 our volunteer experience isn\u2019t going anywhere.\nThis new feature promises to not only better support the blind and low-vision community through our app, but we also believe it will offer a way for businesses to better serve their customers by prioritizing accessibility. We plan to begin beta testing this with our corporate customers in the coming weeks, and to make it broadly available later this year as part of our Specialized Help offering.\nThis feature is currently in a closed beta and is being tested for feedback among a small subset of our users. We will expand the group of beta testers over the next few weeks and we hope to make the Virtual Volunteer broadly available in the coming months. Just like our existing volunteer service, this tool is free for all blind and low-vision community members using the Be My Eyes app.\nWe\u2019re going to listen hard to our community and continuously work to improve the technology and experience. It\u2019s deeply important to us that our community has a significant role in helping us further develop this tool by providing critical, valuable feedback that will influence the future of this technology and what it\u2019s able to provide. From developing additional use cases to shaping the interface, we want our community to shape this technology to best serve their needs. Our team at Be My Eyes is incredibly grateful to our users for their input, and we\u2019ll continue to welcome feedback as we fine tune this new tool. We\u2019re committed to moving thoughtfully and listening intently, while prioritizing safety above all else.\nEventually, we hope to apply this technology to provide people with powerful tools and capabilities to enrich their virtual assistant experience in amazing and complex ways we never thought would be possible.\nImagine navigating a train system in an unfamiliar place, traveling in a foreign country where you don\u2019t speak the language, browsing websites and social media platforms, online shopping, and a host of other ways we know our community will help us identify \u2013 the possibilities are limitless, and we\u2019re just getting started.\nIf you or someone you know is blind and wants to be put on a waiting list to test-drive the Virtual Volunteer tool, you can register here to the waitlist.\nLearn more at bemyeyes.com and join us on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok."

This version has more performance improvements and bug fixes than ever before!\nRatings and Reviews\nBest resource for EVERYTHING!\nWayfair has everything. In the last year, I\u2019ve bought two desks, four area rugs, dining room chairs, a new upholstered platform bed, curtains, and a 12\u201d pillow-top memory foam mattress (at a fraction of the cost charged by the new trendy online mattress companies). Then after making sure my husband & I were comfortable, I bought some cat \u201cshelves\u201d(stylish ramps to attach to your walls so that your cats can look down on you literally and figuratively). And once I decide which will be the best for our spoiled felines, I\u2019m also ordering a cat tree in grey to match the tufted velvet grey sofa I got from Wayfair. Only Wayfair makes sure that everything you order is not only safe, fun, and ultra comfy, but also stylish. I love that I can buy furniture, bedding, curtains, cat condos & carriers (have you ever checked out their pet items?), decorative items, and so much more all in one place. Because I live in a very small town, shopping options are minimal. Wayfair is like having all the glories of L.A. (where we used to live) without the freeways and two-hour drives to a store 7 miles away. So, the selections are phenomenal, the prices are great (I do wait for sales \u2014 they send me nifty email), and our new home is coming together wonderfully. Wayfair is my one stop shop for everything for our home and its two- and four-legged occupants.\nDeveloper Response ,\nThis review is AMAZING! Thank you for shopping with us and for sharing this. We hope your cats love what you pick out for them \ud83d\ude3b\nA complete letdown and disappointment!!!\nI ordered a trampoline on April 3, it said estimated delivery may 15th. I waited patiently and NEVER received any email stating the status of my order. I called a couple of times (ever time waiting for a minimum of 30 minutes) just to check on it and was never told there was any problem. It was expected to ship to me on time! On may 11, I called again since the status online still said preparing to ship, I spoke with Bernard and he informed me I would receive an email because it would be on a truck for delivery that day. On Tuesday the status still said preparing to ship so I called again and this time the customer support representative actually looked into the supplier and found out there were no trampolines in stock! Why did Bernard lie???? Why didn\u2019t the manufacturer inform Wayfair that there were no in stock trampolines (I could wait until mid July for one....ya right!!!), and most importantly why does Wayfair not send any confirmation emails letting you know what\u2019s going on???? I\u2019m so disappointed and had to inform my daughter who has been waiting for over a month, that our trampoline is not coming!!! This was my first and LAST time shopping with Wayfair!!!! Thank you for being nothing but a disappointment!!!!\nI CANT BELIEVE I DIDN\u2019T FIND THEM SOONER\nAs I have worked in customer service my entire career, I have always had extremely high expectations for any company and their employees for going above and beyond with Customer Service. Until I started shopping at Wayfair, I have never seen a company who consistently has the best customer service that goes above and beyond the call of duty on every single issue they encounter. I love to shop, but it is an absolute joy to purchase from them because you know if there\u2019s ever an issue they will do any and everything they can to correct the problem at their expense and make it as easy for you as possible. In my opinion they are the best company with the best customer service standards that are currently in business. If I have a chance to buy something at Wayfair, I would buy it at Wayfair , even if it was more expensive, which it never is, but even hypothetically if it was, I would still buy at Wayfair because I know I would be covered and guaranteed wonderful customer service every single time.

      "text": "Emmish J\nThere are too many ready combinations, a bit hard to just find the original, for example PAX, METOD, PLATSA. There should be an easy way to just find the barebone product. Also it would be nice if there was a possibility to search by measurements, in case you have a space you need to fill out want something that is the same size as something you already have. That also goes for things that are made to fit into certain pieces of furniture, like boxes and such, they should have a category too.\n21 people found this review helpful\nTien Pham\nYour app doesn't have full information about size (a shelf unit is 50x50cm, but how deep is it?) I want to see the manuals or related items, but it doesn't have it.

When the assistant is frazzled and has no way to manually enter the code, then you get to pay full price and waste time asking to have the reward reinstated elsewhere in the store (unless you can find the mystical option of 'unselect reward' in the customer support section of the app).

I recently decided it was time to rethink my home\u2019s organizational condition! Unfortunately, most of my day was spent desperately trying to navigate the swamp that is The Container Store\u2019s internet presence. It took me hours to find anything I was remotely looking for (in part due to load times and overall glitchiness). Finally, after a simple Google search, I was pointed in the direction of IKEA\u2019s site. I promptly found exactly what I was looking for, was delighted to see they deliver to my area, AND happened to stop by on the right day because I got everything 20% off! Needless to say, I downloaded their very well-built app, joined the \u201cIKEA Family,\u201d and I now have a KNORVA and two FRAKTA\u2019s heading my way (in addition to the items that originally led me to them). \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea l\u00e4nge leve sverige!\ndon\u2019t order from here unless\u2014\nI\u2019ve ordered furniture from here almost A MONTH AGO, set my delivery date, and haven\u2019t heard anything since I bought & ordered my furniture. it\u2019s been a week since my expected delivery date & i have heard NOTHING and everytime I call, I\u2019m either wasting 40+ mins listening to the same three sentences on HOLD waiting for someone to even answer the phone or i hear \u201cwell it looks like you order hasn\u2019t been sent out yet,\u201d well yeah.. I KNOW that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling YOU. I was told I would hear from IKEA in 2-3 days and again, HAVE HEARD NOTHING. In the amount of time it took to read this, I\u2019ve read and edited this review(10 mins on hold as of rn). they finally transferred me to a resolutions department THREE calls ago and after 20 mins of me waiting for someone to answer the phone, when they finally did, they said \u201cHello\u201d and before i can even say anything, THEY HUNG UP ON ME. I really loved their furniture and couldn\u2019t wait to receive my order, considering i\u2019ve spent $200+ on just a DELIVERY FEE, you would THINK I would have even heard something back, but boy was I wrong. beautiful furniture.. but i wouldn\u2019t know seeing as though, I\u2019ve only seen pictures from the app, NOT worth wasting time to even get an answer back, for the to tell you the most OBVIOUS reason you called. unless you have all day LITERALLY and want to listen to the same, three sentence automated hold tone, then THIS IS FOR YOU!!! not happy at all (15 mins now on hold)\nProbably the LEAST Customer Friendly APP in Retail\nSo in one world to describe this app it would be \u2018why\u2019. Why can\u2019t you search for key words and find something (note to IKEA, but not everyone or even some people know what crafty names you associate with your products). You took away the ability to even search a receipt or locate a receipt which means I couldn\u2019t not return something because EVEN WITH the credit card that I used your associate still said they couldn\u2019t return it. Why not take it back? I mean it says IKEA right on the front of the unopened package\u2026.does anyone ELSE sell IKEA brand? Finally the searching for a receipt even in the old system entirely SUCKED. So using a crystal ball, you have to try to remember when you purchased what and then one by one go thru a receipt. If you want to see a PERFECT customer experience, go to the REI site and become a customer. Search receipts by date, with pictures, with EASY search.\nNot sure if this is new, but the upgraded website is a tremendous downgrade for customers.\nLastly- you make the app so NOT intuitive, that I simply stop trying to buy stuff. I have found items I want, not in stock in my store, but somewhere else in the country. Can you easily order it? Not at all. Could never figure it out. Simply put, you lost a number of sales from me because of this.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, Inter IKEA Systems B.V., indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

      "text": "It's not the camera that will make you a better nature photographer and set your photos apart. Neither is it the lens, nor even Photoshop. It is knowledge that makes the difference, and these nature apps will give you a huge step up in that area.\n5 Seek\nWith Seek, you can identify almost any animal or plant. All you have to do is take a picture and upload it; the app will give you information about what's in the photo. While it may not seem like a big deal with Google Lens and Visual Look Up available on our phones, Seek is focused on giving you comprehensive information about plants and animals.\nFor example, the app provides complete taxonomy information, including the scientific name, class, family, and so on. Although I don't have to know these details, I appreciate that I can use the opportunity to learn about the natural world. Then when I see a similar species, I can connect the dots with its similarities.\nThe app also shows the range, seasonality, availability nearby, and any similar species. As a macro and bird photographer, I find this very handy since I can get all the relevant details in one place. There's no need to go back to Google to look for further information, which saves time and lets me focus more on my photography.\nThe challenges and badges also encourage you to get out and learn more about the creatures around you. I'm impressed with how Seek feeds my love for learning.\nDownload: Seek for iOS | Android (Free)\n4 Merlin Bird ID\nIf I had to credit one factor that considerably improved my bird photography, it'd be Merlin. It's mind-blowing, because I always thought my 120-frames-per-second camera and the 1.4x teleconverter would make the difference. Not to mention that Merlin is completely free, while I've spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars on my gear.\nMerlin is a super-simple app that the whole family can enjoy; it uses sound recognition to help you identify nearby birds. Just start recording audio once you're in a park, natural area, or trail. The app will listen to the sounds and list all the birds nearby. When you hear a particular bird, the app will flash its name. So you can learn to identify bird sounds in real time.\nIf you go to the same location multiple times, you're sure to become an expert birder as the bird sounds become instantly familiar. Before using the app, I was shooting without any cues. Even with a guidebook in hand, it was a frustrating experience. But Merlin makes birding and bird photography accessible and enjoyable.\nAlong with identification, you can also explore the birds in your area by learning their range, seasonality, and rarity. It would have taken years for me to learn all this on my own through research and experience. So if you're a newbie bird photographer, get this app first before buying any other camera gear.\nDownload: Merlin Bird ID iOS | Android (Free)\n3 AllTrails\nUnlike the above two apps, AllTrails didn't give me groundbreaking new information. Instead, it helps me avoid getting lost on the trail. Before it, I\u2019d often get caught up photographing something while my group moved ahead. It'd be a nerve-wracking few minutes until I found them or saw a trail marker.\nWith AllTrails, I like to check the trail beforehand and start it on the app right before hiking the trail. Now, I'm no longer worried about going alone on a trail or losing my way. I know exactly where I am all the time. That peace of mind allows me to pause and focus on the gorgeous nature around me.\nWhat's more, the app lets you explore additional trails, or join another trail and take a different route. I can also specifically search for wildflowers or animal-specific trails. The app's community aspect is helpful, letting you check reviews and photos.\nGoing to a remote location without a mobile network? No worries. The premium version, AllTrails+, lets you download the trail map for offline use. I don't have the plus version, but it's nice to have the option if you need the upgrade.\nDownload: AllTrails for iOS | Android (Free, subscription available)\n2 eBird\neBird is a citizen science app where all users add their bird sightings to a database. Scientists then use this information for research. You can create checklists and keep track of all the birds you've seen. In addition to making lists, I use it to find birding hotspots nearby.\nAfter using Merlin, I didn't feel the need for another birding app. But I was puzzled by the bird photographers I met on the trails, who would often be rushing to see a rare bird someone spotted in the area. The birding community may be small, but I was still curious how they always seemed to know the latest sightings. Enter eBird's rare bird alert.\nAs soon as someone adds a rare bird in a particular location to their checklist, you'll get an alert. Then, you drop everything you're doing, rush to the spot, and hunt\u2014figuratively speaking\u2014 for that elusive bird.\nBird photography is a slow and mindful process for me, and I like to keep it that way. So I don't want to get caught up in the competition to find the rare bird, but I like the interest and conversation eBird brings. Even though I've happily turned off the notification now, I still check the rare birds page to be aware of what's happening in the community.\nDownload: eBird for iOS | Android (Free)\n1 iNaturalist\niNaturalist is the mother of all nature apps and needs no introduction. As someone living in a new country, I relied heavily on iNaturalist to understand the creatures in my new home. Without the app, I would've been completely lost\u2014or lost interest altogether. (This was way before the introduction of the Seek app.)\nThe latest version features AI-powered tools to make your learning even more enjoyable. Along with identifying species, the new iNaturalist gives a confidence percentage. It identified my Baltimore Oriole photo with a confidence rating of 79%. I'm sure of the species, but iNaturalist probably gave that value because of the foliage in front.\nThe app also has a community discussion section where others can add their expertise. Someone once gave a mini-lesson on the difference between a muskrat and a beaver, right in the comments.\nThis particular feature, with multiple layers of checks, is invaluable to me because the apps are not always right. I once added the wrong name to an organism that an app misidentified. Somebody pointed that out during an exhibition in an art gallery, which was embarrassing.\nAll your observations are saved on iNaturalist; you can refer to them anytime. Also, you can search for animals and plants in any geographic location on the map. There are also challenges you can participate in.\nIf you want a no-frills, reliable app to learn about the natural world, nothing can beat iNaturalist.\nDownload: iNaturalist for iOS | Android (Free)\nAs a new photographer, it's easy to believe that you need a million different pieces of equipment to get great results. There are many skills to learn, from cameras and lenses to lighting and composition. All these are essential, but intimate knowledge of your subjects is the key to portraying them well.\nSo go ahead and download one (or more!) of these apps to learn more about nature and improve your photography at the same time."

      "text": "Most people can't imagine traveling without a smartphone. We use our smartphones as a GPS, camera, and way to contact our friends. In foreign countries, you can whip out your smartphone to translate signs, local people, and even yourself.\nWith just a simple app, your phone can become your personal translator. These best language translation apps for Android and iOS will have you covered on your next adventure.\n1. iTranslate Translator\nEnjoyed by nearly half a million users, iTranslate Translator is one of the best translation apps available. With its augmented reality translation feature, you can translate text, voice, images, and even your surroundings. However, some features are only available for paid users.\nStill, you can access its handy Phrasebook even if you're a free user. The Phrasebook consolidates common things you'll likely need to ask or request at different locations, thus making it an app every traveler should download.\nThe phrases are sorted into categories such as While Traveling, Help/Medical, At the Restaurant, and more. In each category, the phrases are also organized into subsections. For example, in the While Traveling category, there are phrases for buying tickets and finding information about public transportation.\nDownload: iTranslate Translator for Android | iOS (Free, subscription available)\n2. Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the best translation apps due to its versatility and simplicity. And you can access even more features in Google Translate's mobile app. The service supports over 100 languages for translations of typed or handwritten text.\nWhen you have to communicate with someone who speaks another language, forget awkward hand gestures and pointing\u2014the Google Translate app does the work for you. As you talk into the app, it repeats what you say in the language of your choice. When your conversation partner responds, the app translates it back to you.\nGoogle Translate also comes in handy at foreign restaurants. Snap a picture of the menu, and it will provide a translation. Google Translate supports more than 50 languages for camera translation and conversation mode.\nDon't forget about the offline mode in case you're in an area without internet. You can still translate most languages when you're away from Wi-Fi.\nDownload: Google Translate for Android | iOS (Free)\n3. Microsoft Translator\nMicrosoft Translator is another big name in translation apps and offers an even simpler interface than Google Translate. To start, four big bubbles float on the app's home screen. Their functions are pretty self-explanatory: voice translation, conversation translation, photo translation, and text translation.\nWhat makes Microsoft Translator so innovative is its ability to translate your message for a wider audience who speak different languages, making it perfect for a presentation. Just make sure that you don't speak too fast so that the app can accurately capture the words you're saying.\nHere's a quick rundown of how to give a speech through Microsoft Translator: After you start up conversation mode, you'll receive a code. Give this code to your listeners, and they can join your conversation. As you talk or type into the app, your listeners will see a translation of your speech in their own language.\nAlthough Microsoft Translator supports fewer languages than Google Translate, it's still just as powerful.\nDownload: Microsoft Translator for Android | iOS (Free)\n4. Reverso Translate and Learn\nReverso is definitely limited when it comes to supported languages (it only works with 16), but it provides more detailed information than other translation apps. If you're concerned about not having internet access, the app also lets you download offline dictionaries as a backup.\nChoose a language and type a word into the search bar. On the results page, the app presents alternatives to that word in whichever language you choose. Besides providing several definitions that show how to use the word in different contexts, it also gives you synonyms and antonyms.\nReverso is also a really neat language-learning app. With its Word to Discover feature, the app can also serve as a dictionary app to expand your vocabulary because it offers a new word for you to learn each time you open the app.\nDownload: Reverso Translate and Learn for Android | iOS (Free, in-app purchases available)\n5. Naver Papago\nWhen you open Papago, you'll notice an area to type the text you want to translate, along with four colorful bars that represent your translation options. It supports 13 languages you can translate via text, voice, photo, or scanning.\nSelect Papago Mini, and you can access the translator while you surf the web. A dark grey box will appear at the top of your browser. You can choose to move it to the bottom of your screen as well. To receive a complete translation, simply highlight the chunk of text, tap Copy, and choose Allow Paste.\nIn addition to all these features, Papago also stores your frequently used phrases, gives you access to a dictionary, and translates entire websites.\nDownload: Naver Papago for Android | iOS (Free)\n6. SayHi Translate\nSayHi is made specifically for translating speech and text, which means it's a bit limited in other features. However, it does support a variety of languages and a large number of Spanish dialects.\nThis app makes it easy to have a conversation in another language. Tap the microphone icon to speak into your phone, or hold the icon to open the keyboard. Your speech or text gets translated instantly and appears on the screen as two bubbles\u2014the speaker's words are on top, while the translation is on the bottom.\nIf you want to move your conversation elsewhere, copy it or share it with people via Twitter, Facebook, or SMS.\nDownload: SayHi Translate for Android | iOS (Free)\n7. Dictionary Linguee\nYou probably used Dictionary Linguee in your high school language class. It's a reliable translation tool that puts foreign words into context. The app supports several languages and allows you to conduct bidirectional searches. This means you can search for translations in both English to Chinese and Chinese to English (for example).\nAs soon as you type a word into the search bar, Dictionary Linguee presents you with a definition. This comes from its editorial dictionary assembled by a team of lexicographers, so you know you can trust it.\nYou'll find the results from the translation search engine below the editorial definition. These examples show you how the word is used in online translations.\nDownload: Dictionary Linguee for Android | iOS (Free)\n8. TheaterEars\nIt's not fun to watch a movie entirely in English while still learning the language. TheaterEars is for native Spanish speakers who want to experience the thrill of watching a movie in theaters. However, it can also help those who are trying to brush up on their Spanish skills. Streaming audio during a movie is a creative way to learn a new language, and it's actually quite beneficial.\nThe app finds movies playing in theaters near your location. Currently, it's only available for users in the United States and Puerto Rico. Simply select your movie time and hit Get Track. The movie's audio track will download, and you can gain access to it one hour before showtime.\nMake sure to download TheaterEars when you're ready to see your next flick. Kick back, pop some headphones in, and enjoy the movie in your native language (or a foreign one).\nDownload: TheaterEars for Android | iOS (Free, in-app purchases available)\nUse These Translation Apps So You'll Never Feel Lost in Translation Again\nAfter covering some of the best translator apps out there, we hope you have found one that suits your language translation needs!\nTranslations apps are your lifeline when you struggle to communicate in a foreign country. The next time you're at a loss for words, don't forget that you have a translator right in your pocket."

My son\u2018s fianc\u00e9 asked for baby pictures of my son and his growing up years. I have had a lot of them stored in plastic bins in random order. They are precious to me, however, I haven\u2019t really enjoyed them for quite some time. Time is of the essence and I selected some very special photos to send to her. I am sending the physical photos. I was concerned that I did not have some of the originals and didn\u2019t feel like I had time to scan them. I was just about re-signed to sending them off without digital copies. Then I found this app! My concern was I had quite a few photos and I was not sure I would be able to capture them in the best light. I just started scanning them and saving them into a shared album! This thrills me to no end! It has been hard for me to part with physical photos and I do believe it\u2019s great to have digital ones. That way if they get damaged or lost, I will still have a copy! At the moment, I am working on photos of my son. However, I\u2019m excited about scanning other family photos for genealogical purposes! Again, it is unusual for me to rate an app only moments after using it, but this is truly a godsend, and I will be spreading the word with my friends who struggle with maintaining and sharing their photos! Thank You!!!\nAwesome Digital Photo Scanner with iPhone\nI love how intuitive the app was to digitally scan old photos of family members. I was turned onto this app when my father-in-law recently passed away. I was assisting my wife scan the numerous photos of her father throughout his life. We were using an Epson scanner and found it very tedious and time-,consuming despite the obvious grief we were experiencing for his recent passing. Nonetheless, I thought to myself with all the recent advances in technology isn\u2019t their an easier way to scan these photos for posterity as well as use for a slideshow tribute? Yes, indeed there was and it was free of charge from Google. Works pretty darn well and am impressed how true to the actual pictures the digital copy chame out. I would highly recommend everyone use this app to scan old photos of family members, pets, or anything you cherish and want kept for posterity. Only issue of mine is the lack of real seamless syncing with my MacBook Pro. I find that the Google Photos app doesn\u2019t want to work well with my MacBook Pro. It was getting stuck in the export of the data from my iPhone. Not sure if it is user error but recommend Google tech developers get on that!\nI would give it 10 Stars if I could!!!\nThis app is straight up AWESOME. There are other good scanner apps out there, but this is by far the best photo scanner app I have ever used. In fact, it might even be better than actual photo scanner machines. The quality of scans is great. I scanned several old family photos and they came out clear and accurate.\nIt has to take a picture in the dead center of the picture, then it primos you to move to the four corners of the picture. It similar to when you take panoramic photos with your phone. By taking pictures of the center and each corner, it allows the software of the app to automatically get out any glare, but also maintain the integrity of the photo. Once you're finished with a batch you can save the photos to your Google Photos app.\nI highly recommend it to anyone, but especially those who have been wanting to scan old photos, but have been afraid of the amount of time it would take as well as the money to spend on a photo scanner.

      "text": "Gone are the days of taking documents to the library to scan or spending a bunch of money on a scanner for your home. You can find many applications for Android and iOS that put scanning at your fingertips no matter where you are.\nThese seven options are some of the best scanner apps for Android and iOS, with other handy functionalities besides scanning. They are smart enough to adjust and correct items for you and let you save them where you need to, making them perfect for both business and personal use.\n1. Microsoft Lens\nMicrosoft Lens is a flexible, portable scanner with a nice set of features. You can scan documents, receipts, business cards, notes, and even whiteboards or blackboards with it. The app then uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to recognize handwritten or printed text, allowing you to search, copy, or edit easily.\nIn addition to the versatile scanning abilities, Microsoft Lens provides a Whiteboard Mode with trimming and glare adjustments. The Document Mode also trims and adjusts colors accordingly. For quickly adding contacts from business cards you scan, the app extracts the details and saves them to your address book.\nYou have different saving options in Microsoft Lens. First, you can save the images to OneNote or OneDrive and convert them to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF files. You can also save them directly to your gallery as images or, even better, in PDF format. It also gives you a choice to save the scanned document in more than one format in different places.\nBefore saving, you have the option to convert your document to a different quality (high, medium, or low) and even access a number of easy editing features and annotation. Microsoft Lens is totally free, with no ads and no in-app purchases, making it the best free scanner app for Android and iOS.\nDownload: Microsoft Lens for Android | iOS (Free)\n2. CamScanner\nAnother terrific app available across mobile platforms is CamScanner. This app lets you capture your receipts, notes, business cards, and other documents, including whiteboard discussions. Like Microsoft Lens, CamScanner uses OCR to extract the text from your scans. The app also has smart cropping and automatic enhancement features to clean up your text and images for a sharper appearance.\nMore features include sharing options via email or social media as a PDF, Word, JPEG, or TXT file, advanced editing for annotations, passcode protection, cross-platform syncing, and a keyword search. It also offers a host of built-in tools like a PDF to Word converter, PDF to Excel converter, a QR code scanner, among others.\nSome features are locked behind a subscription, but you will do just fine with the free version. These include electronic signatures, higher resolutions, 10GB cloud storage, an advanced PDF editor, and automatic uploads to Google Drive, Evernote, and other cloud services.\nDownload: CamScanner for Android | iOS (Free, subscription available)\n3. Adobe Scan\nAdobe Scan is also one of the best scanner apps on the market. You can capture pictures, documents, notes, receipts, business cards, and whiteboards, and then the app automatically sharpens them for clarity. With OCR, you can create a PDF that works with Adobe Acrobat Reader and similar products.\nYou can use the enhancement features to crop, rotate, and adjust the colors. Plus, your scans are saved to the Adobe Document Cloud, where you can access, share, highlight, add notes, and perform a search. The app saves files in multiple formats, including JPG and PDF.\nIf you want to do even more with your scans, you can subscribe to a monthly Adobe PDF Pack via an in-app purchase. This allows you to combine files, rearrange documents, export PDF scans to Microsoft Word or PowerPoint files, secure files with passwords, and fill and sign forms. You also get more cloud storage (20GB).\nDownload: Adobe Scan for Android | iOS (Free, subscription available)\n4. Genius Scan\nGenius Scan is another great scanning option for Android and iOS users. There\u2019s no need to tap anything to capture; the app does this for you automatically, which enables you to easily scan documents on Android and iOS. Once you scan your document, contract, or note, you can export it as a JPEG or multiple-page PDF file. The app uses a smart page detection feature to correct the perspective and enhance the images for you.\nWhen you need to scan lengthy documents with many pages, you can use the bulk scanning function. Other awesome features include batch importing of photos, sharing via email and other social apps, password protection, document organization, and helpful search functionality.\nYou can upgrade to a paid version of the app called Genius Scan+ to integrate with cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive OneDrive, and Box.\nDownload: Genius Scan for Android | iOS (Free)\nDownload: Genius Scan+ for Android | iOS ($9.99)\n5. SwiftScan\nFor a document scanner with a built-in QR code and barcode scanner, SwiftScan is a wonderful choice. Like the other applications listed here, you can scan almost anything from documents to notes to whiteboards to business cards. Save scans as either a JPG or PDF and perform a search using the OCR ability.\nSwiftScan lets you scan multiple-page documents, edit and annotate items, and enhance images with color and filters. You can connect with a variety of cloud services, including iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box, as well as Evernote, Slack, and Todoist.\nThe premium version includes unlimited scans, electronic signatures, watermark removal, automatic uploads, multi-page upload, OCR, and more.\nDownload: SwiftScan for Android | iOS (Free, subscription available)\n6. Scanner Pro\nFor iOS users, Scanner Pro is an exceptional, full-featured document scanner. It lets you scan items with your iPhone or iPad and then email, export, save, or upload the images to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneNote, iCloud Drive, and other WebDAV-enabled online storage services.\nThe app uses advanced image processing for automatic corrections, offers color stamps and signatures, recognizes over 25 languages using OCR, and lets you print or fax documents.\nYou can use iCloud sync to access items on all your Apple devices, add password protection to PDFs, edit, save, and undo edits if needed, and share your scans easily. It features automatic uploads to connected cloud storage services, and it\u2019s very easy to use.\nScanner Pro offers in-app purchases for you to access additional features like the ability to remove watermarks, perform full-text searches, and enable password protection.\nDownload: Scanner Pro for iOS (Free, subscription available)\n7. Evernote Scannable\nIf you are a die-hard Evernote fan, then Evernote Scannable might be the perfect app for you. Designed for both iPhone and iPad, you can turn business cards into contacts and scan multiple-page documents with ease.\nWith its fast scanning ability, just point your camera at the document or whiteboard, and Evernote Scannable captures it quickly. Then the app automatically crops and adjusts the image for easier reading. Share or send your scans as JPG or PDF files, or simply save them to Evernote.\nIf you use Evernote and want a simple scanner to save your items without worries of upgrades, check out Evernote Scannable. The app is free and has no in-app purchases.\nDownload: Evernote Scannable for iOS (Free)\nUse the Best Scanner Apps for Android and iOS\nThe seven apps mentioned above are some of the best scanner apps available on mobile devices for scanning documents. Pick whichever one you like the sound of, since most of them are available across both platforms. They have all feature intuitive interfaces, so it won\u2019t take you long before learning how to navigate your app of choice."
