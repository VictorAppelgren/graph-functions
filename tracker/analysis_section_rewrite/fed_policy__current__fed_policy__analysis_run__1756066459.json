      "feedback": "Strengths: you rightly link tariff shocks and Fed policy to near‑term dynamics and you anchor the view with concrete numbers (tariffs near 10% of imports in a 3‑month window; trade deficit around $692.15B; exports ~37% of trade; YTD trade up ~9.6% to $2.71T) and with policy cues (Powell relative to a possible next‑month rate cut; Lagarde on central‑bank independence). Gaps: the analysis lacks a crisp 0–3 week horizon, lacks a testable transmission mechanism from news/data/policy to markets, and does not deploy a structured scenario framework or explicit levels/invalidations that would make it actionable in the target window. It also threads in several non‑core sources (e.g., Skiathos/Express) that don’t inform the macro narrative, and it would benefit from a tighter causal chain that links the external shock to specific asset/credit channels and to housing/consumption in the weeks ahead. Actionable edits (compact, doc‑ready): 1) reframe into a strict 0–3 week timeline with weekly catalysts (week 0: tariff data and Powell/market pricing; week 1–2: CPI/jobs prints and tariff updates; week 3: policy communications/investor positioning), tying each to a measurable market reaction. 2) build a three‑path transmission (base, hawkish, dovish) with assigned probabilities and show how each path would move a few key assets (equities, rates, FX, autos credit) in the next 1–3 weeks. 3) codify key thresholds and invalidations using sourced figures: tariff shock around 10% as a trigger for growth/inflation risks; trade deficit at $692.15B and export ratio ~37% as a drag signal; Fed cut timing contingent on data, not certainty; if CPI/job data beat or tariff policy escalates past a defined threshold (e.g., another tariff step or legal ruling/appeal), invalidate the base case. 4) sharpen the causal chain: tariffs and external demand compression feed into consumer credit dynamics (CDBMWIUTB’s auto‑financing mechanics; negative equity risks) and then into household spending; link to housing/credit frictions exemplified by Bethel’s 8‑30g risk, noting Bethel’s ~$583k median price and $115k median income as a micro‑barometer for local demand and construction financing. 5) quantify more points from sources (cite: 0J41Q7KTX for rate‑cut timing and tariff shock; U6HXAJR4J for central‑bank independence framing; CDBMWIUTB for auto‑financing/negative equity mechanics; F8GF45MEU for Bethel policy/affordability context) and prune non‑essential sources; 6) explicitly state what to monitor next (incoming CPI, payrolls, tariff announcements, any 8‑30g developments in Bethel, lender‑level payoff quotes) and what would constitute a material inflection; 7) tighten prose to avoid hedges and ensure every claim is tied to a source ID; 8) rewrite for horizon focus and remove tangential travel content. Overall, implement a crisp, testable 0–3 week roadmap with explicit catalysts, thresholds, and invalidation rules, anchored entirely in the cited sources (0J41Q7KTX, U6HXAJR4J, CDBMWIUTB, F8GF45MEU), and de‑weight or drop unrelated sources.",
