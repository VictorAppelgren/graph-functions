  "title": "Hideo Kojima is making his Metal Gear spiritual successor Physint \"all by myself\" while Kojima Productions is busy on OD",
  "description": "Physint is still \"another five or six years\" away according to Kojima",
  "content": "Hideo Kojima claims he's working on Physint by himself, while Kojima Productions is now all in on OD following Death Stranding 2's release.\n\nNow that Death Stranding 2 is out (and won't be getting much in the way of DLC by the sounds of things), the list of upcoming Kojima games is down to two (that we know of), OD and his Solid spiritual successor, Physint. But other than some leaks from and a a couple of years back, and pretty much an \"it exists\" for Physint, there hasn't been much on either. That is, unless the song Kojima posted a few weeks ago on Instagram was connected to either.\n\nHowever, in an interview with Kojima gave an update on what he's up to now that Death Stranding has been out for a month. \"I also am starting to work with the team on 'OD' because that\u2019s a new project,\" which makes it very strange to start showing trailers years before starting work on it if you ask me. As for Physint, Kojima said he is \"doing 'Physint' all by myself because that\u2019s at the conceptual stage. So I\u2019m doing that.\"\n\nKojma said a few months ago that Physint is still \"another five or six years\" off, with both it and OD being so it's not exactly a big shocker. But at the very least Konami is bringing Metal Gear back with later this month, so we'll have some tactical espionage action to tide us over in the meantime.",

      "text": "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater \u2013 Everything we know about the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake\nA complete guide to all the latest news and details about the upcoming Metal Gear Solid 3 remake\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a modern Metal Gear Solid 3 remake that will bring the classic action-adventure stealth game from 2004 back to life on Unreal Engine 5, complete with visual enhancements and 3D audio, which promises to make it more immersive than ever.\nConsidered to be one of the best PS2 games of all-time, early impressions paint the picture of a remake that captures the experience of the original, and it'll undoubtedly be a great way for newcomers to experience this iconic Metal Gear game.\nYes, it's certainly one of the most exciting new games for 2025, and we won't have to watch much longer for it to arrive now that August is underway. From recent trailers, to the reveal of a new online multiplayer mode known as Fox Hunt, there's plenty to get excited about, and we've brought together a helpful overview of everything we know so far about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater just below so you can get ready for the game's release.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake release date\nThe Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater release date is August 28, 2025. That means we only have a few months left of waiting, folks.\nThis Metal Gear Solid 3 remake has been a long time coming, as well. The title was initially announced in 2023 with a 2024 launch window. However, the upcoming game was pushed back, leaving fans wondering about the new Metal Gear remake for a few months. With the wait almost over, now is the perfect time to check out our list of the best stealth games of all time to get you back into the sneaking mood.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake platforms\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be launching on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC when August 28 comes around this year. Like most big game releases, console fans can also expect to see a physical release of the title on launch day. However, PC players will only have a digital copy of the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake available to them.\nThe game will also be available for PS5 Pro players as it's officially on the list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games over at Sony. So, yeah, there are plenty of choices for you platform-wise. If you're looking for more details on Sony's latest console before picking up this game, you can check out our PS5 Pro review for more details!\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake pre-orders\nThe good news is that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater pre-orders are now live on Steam and both PlayStation and Microsoft's storefronts. Pre-ordering the standard edition of the game will cost you $69.99/ \u00a369.99, while pre-ordering the deluxe edition will run you $79.99/\u00a379.99.\nThe deluxe edition will give you access to the game two days ahead of the base release date, meaning you can start playing on August 26. It also comes with the \"Sneaking DLC pack\" which includes a handful of cosmetic items such as new uniforms and equipment for Snake.\nBelow is a list of everything included in the Sneaking DLC pack:\n- Battle Dress - Uniform\n- Sneaking Suit - Uniform\n- Crocodile Suit - Uniform\n- Naked (Woodland) - Uniform\n- Naked (Ammunition Belt) - Uniform\n- Gold - Uniform\n- Face: Glasses - Face\n- Face: Sunglasses -Face\n- Kerotan Mask - Equipment\n- GA-KO Mask - Equipment\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake trailer\nThere have been several Metal Gear Solid 3 remake trailers, but the latest showing came during the PlayStation State of Play June 2025 showcase during Summer Game Fest. In it, we get to see some gameplay in action, with Snake sneaking in various ways up above and low to the ground - we even see him the water (complete with a crocodile disguise). Of course, the signature box makes an appearance, too.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake gameplay\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a stealth action game that will primarily stick to the gameplay of the original PlayStation 2 game. You'll be sneaking through forests and bases, taking down guards, and trying to fight off the subordinates of the Boss.\nIn the trailer shown during the February 2025 PlayStation State of Play showcase, we also saw Snake using some martial arts to overpower a guard. This indicates that \"close-quarters combat\" or \"CQC\" - aka the hand-to-hand combat system from the original game- is making a comeback in this remake as well.\nIn terms of new features in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the big difference is visuals. The remake looks stunning, and cut scenes feel dynamic as they allow you to zoom in and out of each 4K scene with ease. The PlayStation 2's original control scheme, which, let's be honest, was far from perfect, has had an overhaul in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater as well, along with animations getting a fresh coat of paint as well.\nAs our hands-on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater preview (which you can watch in video form above) of the game points out, in terms of remakes, it takes more of a purist approach. It makes quality-of-life improvements and upgrades the visuals, however, the original's gameplay and core story are largely untouched.\nAnother fun gameplay feature that's returning in the remake is that PS5 players will have an Ape Escape mode where Snake has to chase and catch cartoonish monkeys with a habit of mocking you across the map. This mode is, of course, from the Metal Gear cross-over with the Ape Escape games. However, Xbox players won't be getting to experience this since Ape Escape is a Sony Property.\nInstead, Xbox players will be getting a mode with a Bomberman crossover. We're still waiting on news regarding what PC players will be getting here, so stay tuned as more details head our way.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake online multiplayer\nDuring the Konami Press Start showcase, a Metal Gear Sold Delta Snake Eater online multiplayer mode was revealed. Called Fox Hunt, the new, original mode is said to broaden \"the franchises core stealth element where players must utilize their environments to camouflage and evade opposing players\".\nFox Hunt producer Yu Sahara spoke on the online multiplayer mode for Snake Eater, and put emphasis on the fact that while many will think of Metal Gear Online, this is very much it's own an original experience, saying that \"the landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot since MGO\".\nWhile the Metal Solid Delta: Snake Eater base game is set to launch in August, the Konami website shows that the \"thrilling hide-and-seek based, completely original online multiplayer\" mode is expected to arrive in \"Fall 2025\". So, it looks like Fox Hunt will follow the game's launch and come sometime later on. We'll be watching out for a concrete release date.\nMetal Gear Solid 3 remake development\nThe big question on everyone's mind about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater's development is whether Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima was involved in the project after he publicly split with Konami. Well, we're here to set the record straight. Kojima Productions is not involved with the new Metal Gear remake.\nThe title is instead being handled by Konami's internal developer, Konami Digital Entertainment, and Virtuos (who has co-developed titles such as the Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster and Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered). Despite the fact that neither Kojima nor original artist Yoji Shinkawa is involved in the new game, Konami has made sure to stick to a faithful adaptation of the original game. The Metal Gear official Twitter account reaffirmed this point in a post, explaining how it led to the game's name \"Metal Gear Solid Delta\".\n\"The Delta symbol (\u0394) was chosen because its meaning fits the concept of the remake project,\" the official Metal Gear account clarified. \"Delta means 'change' or 'difference' without changing structure.\"\nThe Delta symbol (\u0394) was chosen because its meaning fits the concept of the remake project. Delta means \"change\" or \"difference\" without changing structure.#MetalGearSolid#MGSDelta pic.twitter.com/LRWrNzg3heMay 25, 2023\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is also the first Metal Gear game not to use Fox Engine - which was a proprietary game engine by Konami. Instead, the game uses Unreal Engine 5. It's an end of an era, folks!\nFor more future titles, check out our guides on all the upcoming Hideo Kojima games and all the new PS5 games heading our way.\nAfter reviewing films throughout University and being a cosy game expert for years, I realised that entertainment journalism was my true calling in 2019.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nThe chance to speak with Hideo Kojima is not totally unlike meeting a world leader. Alternately \u2014 extending this metaphor another way \u2014 talking to him while activity at Kojima Productions buzzes in the background over a video interview suggests having a peek inside a spy agency.\nThe video game auteur, whose Tokyo studio is visited by everybody from Conan O\u2019Brien to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, has just released \u201cDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach,\u201d the sequel to 2019\u2019s \u201cDeath Stranding\u201d and his second consecutive work that does more to break from the medium\u2019s confines than anything I could name. \u201cOn the Beach\u201d is an especially bold step towards the cinematic, with a cast (Norman Reedus, L\u00e9a Seydoux, George Miller, Guillermo del Toro, Luca Marinelli, Nicolas Winding Refn, Elle Fanning, and Fatih Akin) far closer to a major festival lineup than animated characters in a video game.\nEven if IndieWire\u2019s own David Ehrlich hadn\u2019t claimed \u201cDeath Stranding 2\u201d was a \u201cmega-bizarre masterpiece,\u201d Kojima is a figure who deserves time and attention. Speaking as someone who\u2019d write out the absurdly convoluted \u201cMetal Gear Solid\u201d chronology while bored in middle-school math, the opportunity was not to be taken lightly. When I called into Kojima Productions last week, the director was taking a break from his next projects: \u201cOD,\u201d a horror game co-written with Jordan Peele and starring Hunter Schafer, Sophia Lillis, and Udo Kier; and \u201cPhysint,\u201d a stealth action game that has already kicked up rumors of a lead role for Robert Pattinson. Questions about those were \u2014 surprise \u2014 immediately deflected, but \u201cDeath Stranding 2\u201d offered sufficient fodder for discussion.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nIndiewire: It\u2019s Tuesday in Tokyo, and \u201cDeath Stranding 2\u201d has been out for exactly a month. What are you working on today?\nHideo Kojima: Well, I\u2019m checking the data of the players all over the world \u2014 what kind of weapons they\u2019re using, the routes they\u2019re taking, all this data. And I also see these small bugs here and there, so I\u2019m deciding where to fix and what to fix. I also am starting to work with the team on \u201cOD\u201d because that\u2019s a new project, and also doing \u201cPhysint\u201d all by myself because that\u2019s at the conceptual stage. So I\u2019m doing that. And also I have all these interviews every day, and also promotional \u2014 photo-shootings, things like that \u2014 so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve finished the title, to be frank.\nNo work of art is ever truly flawless or perfect. I wonder how you feel about having this after-the-fact ability to improve your own work. That\u2019s a unique opportunity compared with filmmakers who can\u2019t necessarily go back to fix flaws in their films. Do you feel a game ever is emboldened because of its flaws?\nThere are some things that you shouldn\u2019t change. Like the story, for example, because there is a certain era that that story was born. You shouldn\u2019t change those kinds of parts. Or, you know, like [George] Lucas changed [\u2018Star Wars\u2019] to all CG, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a new era, right? So I don\u2019t want to change anything that would affect the era that it first came out. The things that I said that I\u2019m changing are, you know, all the things basically related to gameplay. Like: This item was not very easy to use, so I\u2019ll make it a little bit more accessible, or, like, make the UI bigger. These small parts are the ones that I\u2019m changing. I know that DLC [downloadable content] is not a trendy space because if you start doing that, you\u2019ll never finish the project.\n\u201cDeath Stranding 2\u201d is maybe your most confidently directed work, and I\u2019m fascinated by how your style has reached a kind of minimalism since the later \u201cMetal Gear Solid\u201d games. The cutscenes tend to be shorter, the shots longer, the visual style more fluid.\n\u201cDS1,\u201d there were a lot of long cutscenes, yes, because it was supposed to start slow, right, and to explain everything \u2014 it was slow \u2014 but I see a lot of people discontinuing watching the cutscenes from \u201cDS1\u201d by stats. Because, for me, cutscenes are part of the game. Some people don\u2019t even think about that, but I believe cutscenes are part of the game. So what I do is: I have these bunches of cutscenes, games, and events, and I lay them out and really change through the play-through \u2014 like, I change the length of the cutscene if the cutscene, I feel, is too long. The rhythm is very important. I check the rhythm of the game, and I kind of change everything. So maybe, you know, that\u2019s one reason. I even change it after taking the motion after sessions with the actors, and I kind of adjust the balance of that rhythm, as I said, and I think it\u2019s becoming better because of that.\nWhat tech advancements affected your directorial style in recent years \u2014 is it the reliability of A-list acting talent, smaller cameras that allow for more movement and set-ups, or something else altogether?\nDuring the pandemic, we held performance-capture sessions at the Sony studio in L.A. We had the actors arrive on set in L.A, but our staff was restricted from traveling abroad. I had to direct from Tokyo. Those were the rules by Sony at the time. Reluctantly, I was forced to direct from afar. We used smartphones, Zoom, iPads, and multiple cameras for the remote session. I protested and said it was impossible, but I was told that all other studios were also doing it remotely and that I would need to follow the same rules. To test out the remote session, we tried out two scenes that didn\u2019t require the main characters. The results were quite disastrous. I couldn\u2019t grasp the spatial dynamics of the set, like the positioning of the virtual cameras, the actors\u2019 movements, and directing their performance; it felt hopeless. I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to shoot.\nThat\u2019s when I reached out to the development team about a system called \u201cMado\u201d [\u201cWindow\u201d in English] at Sony headquarters. I borrowed two of them and set them up \u2014 one in Tokyo, the other in L.A. It\u2019s like a giant smartphone the size of a door. The two were synced and allowed for two-way communication of both footage and sound. On the other side of the screen, we could see life-sized actors. Though it was through a screen, we were able to communicate with each other as if we were standing outside each other\u2019s window. We were able to overcome that period by fully utilizing that technology.\nCan you talk a bit about what that remote work looked like, and how you feel your direction benefits from being in person with your actors?\nWell, even though I have, like, 20 cameras on this side and that side as well, it was really difficult to describe the stage and the set in its direction. Like, for instance, me directly saying, \u201cOK, you act from here to there. You walk from here to there.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to just say \u201chere to there.\u201d They won\u2019t know where from where. For instance, if I were talking to the actor on the spot in the scene \u2014 like Norman [Reedus] \u2014 I had to say, \u201cHey, Norman, you walk from here all the way up to L\u00e9a and you say this line,\u201d and things like that, it\u2019s so difficult to explain that if you\u2019re not there. Although I could see, because we set up so many cameras, it\u2019s so difficult to explain the position physically at just one point. [Laughs] I couldn\u2019t wrap it up as though I was in the scene \u2014 I was just through the camera, and that was so difficult.\nYou talked about how the quality of an actor\u2019s facial scan between \u201cDeath Stranding\u201d and \u201cOn the Beach\u201d improved significantly \u2014 specifically how L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s face is now more lifelike, more vivid. Did seeing stronger face work engender anything in a rewriting process? If you watch these scenes and understand you can actually gather more emotion from L\u00e9a or Elle Fanning or Norman Reedus, than you had understood while you were initially writing a scene.\nYes, I do that a lot. I even did during shooting as well. Like, for instance, L\u00e9a\u2019s smoking scene \u2014 that was not initially in it, and I had it added. [Laughs] As you know, we\u2019ve been working with 3Lateral, and the rigs of the facial have really upgraded, and we could do a lot of facial expressions \u2014 very subtle ones as well \u2014 so I kind of even changed the scenes where I take out some lines because facial expressions could be covered, and I kind of make that decision on the spot. Even the lighting: I kind of asked a lighting technician, a professional lighting technician, to come to teach the staff about lighting in general, so we took, like, a healthy two years to learn all of this about all of this \u2014 about all the lights and things like that. So that could have an influence, too. [Laughs]\nYou\u2019ve often talked about blurring boundaries between cinema and video games. What is the greatest struggle in doing so? Outside the obvious matter of interactivity, where are the media most incompatible?\nIn film, the creator controls the timeline. They can choose exactly what images to show, what performances to present, and what sounds to let the audience hear. Everything is delivered the way the creator wants. But with games, that\u2019s not possible except in cutscenes. The creator has no control over the timeline \u2014 the player decides everything. Sometimes, players might even skip important scenes. The creator has no say in that. That\u2019s where games differ from films. And from theater, too \u2014 in theater, you\u2019re free to look wherever you want, but the timeline remains controlled. In games, you can view the stage from any angle and even walk away midway. In other words, creators can\u2019t calculate or plan everything because it all depends on the player\u2019s actions. Films are about showing a series of carefully curated images, but you can\u2019t approach games with the same mindset. I think that\u2019s where it creates a sense of uncertainty for both the performers and the director.\nThere\u2019s also the issue of recording time. Unlike films, where you can concentrate on the shoot over a period of three to six months, that kind of intensive schedule is difficult for games. Game development involves filming little by little as you go \u2014 maybe like a week each month, sometimes with long gaps in between. For \u201cDS2,\u201d the entire process took about three years. That makes it a very challenging environment for the actors. Scheduling is difficult, too. Sometimes there\u2019s been a long gap since the last session, and the actor must recall the emotional tone from the previous performance.\n\u201cOn the Beach\u201d continues the narrative arcs and themes of \u201cDeath Stranding\u201d very fluidly. That\u2019s surprising because you\u2019ve been very honest that a lot of the game was rewritten amid COVID-19. But you\u2019ve never revealed the original plot. Now that we\u2019re some time away from \u201cDeath Stranding 2\u201d and people like myself have actually been able to play it, are you at any liberty or desire or comfort to say how the original version of the game would have differed?\n[Laughs] Well, I found the initial concept sheet, actually. I have to say a big theme of \u201cDS2,\u201d or the direction, hasn\u2019t really changed, but the story \u2014 or the ending \u2014 has changed after the pandemic, yes. The first half seems quite similar to the original one, but from the middle point onwards, I kind of rewrote a lot. You know, all these lines that were newly created are actually spoken by the President [Alastair Duncan] at the end \u2014 or what Die-Hardman [Tommie Earl Jenkins] says at the end. This is what I was thinking during the pandemic, and I put that in there. So that\u2019s a big change.\nDo you expressly prefer keeping something like a concept sheet tucked away and letting the game exist as it does? One of your favorite films is \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and part of its mythology is the question of whether or not Deckard is a replicant, right? But that\u2019s something that only came about because Ridley Scott, decades later, would admit it. I wonder if you have a similar interest in sharing alternate versions of your work.\n[Laughs] No, I don\u2019t feel like I should say those things. I have my conclusion. I have my, you know, things that I thought about, but if I confess that, it won\u2019t probably be art anymore. For instance, if I drew a drawing of an apple and I put that in a museum and I say \u201cthis is an apple,\u201d but all the people who saw it, it doesn\u2019t matter if they think it\u2019s an apple or a banana. But if I say, \u201cNo, no, no, what are you saying? I drew an apple,\u201d I shouldn\u2019t say that. Well, Ridley Scott is an exception. He\u2019s a Sir, right? He could say whatever he wants.\nIs there something that you look for or see in an actor, in a live-action context, that tells you they could convincingly deliver a motion-capture performance? If it\u2019s something in their face, their voice, their body language. Because I think you might be the only person who\u2019s ever watched Luca Marinelli and said, \u201cHe should be in a video game.\u201d Or is it as simple as one form of acting translating to another?\nWell, I don\u2019t really regard them as being \u201cin the game.\u201d I just look for actors who are good \u2014 like, they\u2019re good in terms of the looks or the emotion, their expression, their acting. And when I think of a character in my game, I think of, \u201cOK, who should I cast?\u201d And those people come up. At the same time, we take one step of changing them to CG, so they have to really be individualistic. You see what I mean? We take one cushion, as a CG, until we put them in their performance. Then what I do is: I talk to them directly. And if it matches, I talk to their agents. So I think it\u2019s the same as, you know, casting in the movies. Every time I talk with Guillermo del Toro or Nicholas Winding Refn, we always talk about, \u201cOh, who\u2019s coming? Oh, did you see that movie? Did you see his acting? Did you see her acting?\u201d It\u2019s kind of the same with even these movie directors. So I regard myself as no different than how I cast in other people as well.\nAre there any deceased actors who you think might have fit your worlds and sensibility?\nThat would be my childhood hero, Steve McQueen. If it were possible, even with CG, I would love for him to be in one of my games someday. In my games, I\u2019ve featured film directors whom I know personally or greatly respect. In fact, I had always hoped to cast David Lynch, a director I\u2019ve admired for so long. However, he passed away not long ago, and I\u2019m devastated.\nSome have compared your games to the work of Thomas Pynchon, who even went so far as to mention you in \u201cBleeding Edge.\u201d Are you familiar with Pynchon\u2019s work, and has it served as any kind of influence on you as a writer?\nYes, I know Thomas Pynchon and read, and acknowledge that I was in one of his writings. Yes. But I don\u2019t really get the point where I\u2019m \u201cinfluenced\u201d; I don\u2019t really think about it, actually.\nWell, that answers the question. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule; it\u2019s very appreciated.\nAlso, I want to add that I do admire Thomas Pynchon as well. [Laughs] I like his writing, so don\u2019t, you know\u2026 don\u2019t get confused about that. Don\u2019t say that I\u2019m not influenced by him or anything like that! Because I do admire him.\n\u201cDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach\u201d is now available on PlayStation 5.\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

      "text": "Kojima's mystery game Overdose leaks in bizarre gameplay video recorded in the worst way imaginable\nBehold: a glare- and nipple-heavy phone recording of a laptop playing a video file\nKojima's next game, the enigmatic OD, has gone from vague teasers to full-blown leaks thanks to the haphazard efforts of a topless man.\nAfter months of varyingly cryptic images, a little over two minutes of Overdose gameplay recently leaked online through a Streamable embed (viewable on ResetEra), and it's about as comically ugly as leaked footage can get.\nWhat we have here is a phone recording of a video file played on a laptop (seemingly via YouTube's video suite, which could suggest an impending trailer release), and in a room lit just poorly enough to repeatedly flash the shirtless torso and extremely visible face of the dude who made and presumably shared this recording. If it was shared by someone else, you've gotta wonder how this guy feels about his nipples being broadcast to the world. Leakers usually try to avoid including so much as an identifiable username or file path in videos like this, let alone their entire face and also their bare chest, so you've also gotta wonder how much forethought went into this.\nIf you squint your eyes and can parse the horrible quality, there is indeed a game buried in here, and it does loosely line up with what little we know about Overdose. If this is a fake, it's a convincing fake, right down to the \"A Hideo Kojima game\" title card at the end.\nA female lead seemingly modeled after Margaret Qualley, who's been tied to several Overdose teasers and previously worked with Kojima Productions on Death Stranding, wanders dark hallways as some sort of humanoid monster approaches in the backdrop. The video is labeled \"Camera Player 1,\" though it's unclear if that's actually an in-game detail or a consequence of this being a non-final presentation of some kind. It's worth remembering that even if this footage is real, it may not accurately reflect the game we'll eventually play.\nPressing on, red points of interest appear on-screen at various points, and it seems the player can interact with them to reveal additional details or have the playable character move to investigate. Things look quite passive otherwise; the only other visible mechanic is a flashlight battery meter in the top-right corner, which steadily ticks down.\nThis really is just two minutes of meandering around before a scream-backed fade to black, complete with an old-school \"Game Over\" message. This is arguably par for the course for Kojima's esoteric narrative experiments, but it does make for a confusing, if hilarious video. Here's hoping our next look at Overdose is more official and informative \u2013 and less naked.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nWhatever this is, it's unclear whether Overdose is the subject of Kojima's partnership with Xbox.\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree.

      "text": "Hideo Kojima and director Jordan Peele announce new horror game for Xbox: it's \"unlike any other game\"\nOD will star Euphoria actress Hunter Schafer\nMetal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima announced OD, a new horror game for Xbox, alongside Us director Jordan Peele at The Game Awards. Finally, he's cashing in on the years of goodwill he built up with horror fans after making the unreleased Silent Hill P.T. nearly a decade ago.\nAnd those who remember the game leaking with the title Overdose in 2022 can finally rest easy or, rather, satisfyingly uneasy. The world premiere trailer is bewitchingly bizarre, showing a gray-haired man (celebrated German character actor Udo Kier), and two young women (It actress Sophia Lillis and The Hunger Games starlet Hunter Schafer) against a black background, under harsh light with strange, overlapping stars reflected in their dark eyes.\n\"The hungry purple dinosaur ate the kind, zingy fox, the jabbering crab, and the mad whale and started vending and quacking,\" the actors repeat arcanely in the trailer, increasing their urgency with every recitation. Finally, a door creaks open offscreen, making Lillis shiver and deliver a hair-raising shriek.\n\u201cI really like to always challenge new things,\" Kojima said on stage through a translator, \"groundbreaking things, and that's my rule. But this one, with Xbox Game Studios' [...] cloud gaming technology [...]\" is something \"no one has ever seen before.\"\n\"It is a game,\" Kojima said, \"don\u2019t get me wrong, but it\u2019s at the same time a movie.\"\nFamed horror movie director Jordan Peele, who Kojima said is one of many \"genius\" collaborators (he calls them his \"Avengers\"), added that \"what this man is building is unlike any other game.\"\n\"What he's cooking up here is completely immersive, utterly terrifying, and I'm absolutely honored to be collaborating with the GOAT,\" Peele said.

At its heart is a bizarre song about having sex with a refrigerator - yup.\n\"While I was in London, I met this strange man who said he was a 'multidisciplinary artist' from Estonia,\" Kojima says in a new Instagram post. \"He said he wanted to eat sushi and after I treated him to some, he gave me a USB key with a link to this very bizarre song as a thank you, which I'd like to share with you here.\"\nAttached is a song called PretzHell, attributed to an artist credited as \"ZXY - The Gyslexic Die.\" It opens with the line \"Shot! She shit me in the head!\" and goes on with banger lines like \"Fix! Coz I didn't fuck the fridge.\" It's honestly kind of a fun listen - aside, you know, from the apparent implications of it being about a dyslexic man getting shot by his partner after forgetting to fix the fridge.\nA post shared by Hideo Kojima (@hideo_kojima)\nA photo posted by on\nInternet sleuths quickly tracked down reference to this PretzHell track on a website for a Paris museum, where the music video for the song was presented in late June. The site identifies the artist as \"Olav Kikkas,\" who \"goes under different pseudonyms (one of which is more well-known than the others).\"\nWhat does this have to do with OD? Who knows! The early fandom conspiracies are latching onto that line about a \"well-known\" pseudonym, suggesting that Olav Kikkas might, in fact, be OD cast member Udo Kier. That seems to be mostly down to the fact that Kier's accent is similar to that of the song's vocalist.\nPersonally? I'm not buying it. Yes, we had the infamous bait-and-switch with Metal Gear Solid 2's protagonist back in the day, and (somewhat) more recently the developer fakeout with Moby Dick Studio on Metal Gear Solid 5. But remember when the world seemed convinced that Abandoned was a Kojima marketing ploy? Remember when a group of fans were certain that there was something akin to a whole 'nother game hidden deep within The Phantom Pain?\nI believe Kojima genuinely met an odd musician in London trying to promote his latest track in the streets, and treated him to a sushi dinner, and I think that's a lot more endearing than an oddball marketing beat for OD. Maybe Olav Kikkas will sneak in a cameo in Kojima's next game.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nNeed a rundown of upcoming Hideo Kojima games?

So it's a bit surreal that after a decade of pachinko, Metal Gear Survive, and weird Bomberman cameos, we are actually back. Sure, it's not quite the Silent Hill treatment with those fans getting a remake and a new game a year apart, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the first bit of hope Metal Gear has had in a decade.\nAnd, it having its own adaptation of Metal Gear Online's best mode in the form of Fox Hunt is a promising sign that the best game ever made is getting treated right. However, one detail we didn't know about Fox Hunt was that it won't be in the game at launch.\nAlthough it was probably obvious as it was a bit peculiar to confirm a multiplayer mode a couple months ahead of launch out of the blue, we never actually had word of when it would arrive. But now Konami's website has quietly given the Online expansion a \"Fall 2025\" release date.\nGranted, this isn't completely unprecedented. Metal Gear Solid 5's MGO expansion released over a month later on consoles and four months later on PC, so it wouldn't be the first time a Metal Gear received its multiplayer post-launch. Hell, the original Metal Gear Online featured in Metal Gear Solid 3 wasn't included until the Subsistence release a year and change later \u2013 and you had to buy the game again, so a few months max doesn't seem too bad in comparison.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nScott has been freelancing for over three years across a number of different gaming publications, first appearing on GamesRadar+ in 2024.

      "text": "Hideo Kojima recently provided an update on the development of two Kojima Production games, OD and Physint, saying work on both projects was held up in 2024 due to the Screen Actors Guild\u2019s strike. Although the strike has ended for Hollywood actors, video game performers are still striking.\n\u201cFor OD, we developed the game and had actor and environment scanning,\u201d Kojima said via X (formerly Twitter). \u201cIn the second half of the year, scanning and filming were suspended due to the SAG strike. Casting was also suspended for Physint due to the strike. We hope to resume next year.\u201d\nWhile we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of Kojima Productions\u2019 next game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, its other projects remain shrouded in mystery.\nEarly gameplay footage of OD \u2014 known at the time as Overdose \u2014 appeared online in Nov. 2022 before the Xbox exclusive was officially revealed a year later at The Game Awards. Kojima teased the project alongside director and collaborator Jordan Peele with a video showcasing actors Sophia Lillis (It, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria, Cuckoo), and Udo Kier (Hunters, Bacurau) reciting a pangram in what appears to be the famous Kojima Productions 3D model-scanning machine.\nEven less is known about Physint, which itself is a working title. The game, exclusive to PlayStation, is apparently meant as Kojima\u2019s return to the film-like action-espionage style he established with the Metal Gear series.\n\u201cI cannot tell you so much now,\u201d Kojima said while announcing the project during a State of Play broadcast in Jan. 2024, \u201cbut we plan to bring together cutting-edge technology and talent from around the world to create [Physint]. Of course, it is an interactive game, but it is also a movie at the same time, in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound. With this title, we hope to transcend the barrier between films and video games.\u201d\nKojima further explained his motivations for making Physint in Feb. 2024, saying he was inspired to return to his roots after a health scare.\nThe strike currently affecting OD and Physint development as well as other parts of the video game industry formally kicked off in July 2024. Organized by the Screen Actors Guild after negotiations between the union and several major video game studios broke down, the strike\u2019s major concern is AI protections for actors who are in danger of having their performances recycled through generative technology without payment or approval.\n\u201cThe bottom line is if you have performers working for you, helping create the content that\u2019s in your game, whether it\u2019s voice content, whether it\u2019s stunt work, whether it\u2019s motion work\u2026 all of those performers deserve to have their right to have informed consent and fair compensation for the use of their image, their likeness or voice, their performance,\u201d SAG-AFTRA executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201d"

While the director says it's still another five or six years away, the game is set to be an \"action-espionage game\" \u2013 so basically a new Metal Gear Solid game sans the actual brand.\nWhile Kojima strayed away from the genre with Death Stranding and is taking a wild step with OD \u2013 an upcoming horror game that's being made with director Jordan Peele for Xbox Game Studios \u2013 Physint marks a return to the style that put Kojima on the map.

The original Death Stranding serves as a good example of this alterable nature of games, with its Director's Cut and various updates coming to mind.\nNot everything that can be changed should be changed, however, as Kojima puts it. \"There are some things that you shouldn't change,\" explains the lead. \"Like the story, for example, because there is a certain era that that story was born. You shouldn't change those kinds of parts. Or, you know, like [George] Lucas changed [Star Wars] to all CG, but that's because it's a new era, right?\" The director wouldn't want to compromise the \"era\" of his work.\n\"I don't want to change anything that would affect the era that it first came out,\" as Kojima states. That's why, when he does plan changes or patches for any of his projects, he carefully considers what developers will alter, ensuring it's all minor or gameplay-related: \"The things that I said that I'm changing are, you know, all the things basically related to gameplay.\" For instance, he might opt to add new accessibility features to a game.\n\"Like: This item was not very easy to use, so I'll make it a little bit more accessible, or, like, make the UI bigger,\" describes Kojima. \"These small parts are the ones that I'm changing.\" As for DLC, the Metal Gear mastermind is less certain about taking it on as the possibilities are often endless.\n\"I know that DLC is not a trendy space because if you start doing that,\" says Kojima, \"you'll never finish the project.\" It's an understandable position to hold \u2013 after all, plenty of games like The Sims 4 fall into an endless loop of DLC releases with no new launches in sight\u2026 a less than ideal route for story-focused directors like Kojima.\nOf course, there are plenty of exciting projects in the works from Kojima now that the Death Stranding sequel is out. His upcoming title OD, which he describes as \"a bit risky\" and \"a game like no other,\" is being produced in collaboration with comedian and filmmaker Jordan Peele, and the Death Stranding movie, which Kojima states is \"not just a direct translation of the game,\" is also underway, presenting a \"universe that has never been seen before.\"\nWhy not read through our Death Stranding 2 review to learn what we think of Kojima's latest gem?

      "text": "The ultimate Death Stranding 2 guide to the post-apocalypse\nLife doesn't have to be a Beach with our Death Stranding 2 guides hub\nOur Death Stranding 2 guide hub has everything you need to know if you're ready to start becoming the perfect post-apocalyptic postman and occasional seaside holidaymaker. Now that it's out, we can confirm that Death Stranding 2 takes the energy of the first game and dials it up, with a greater emphasis on combat, feeling more powerful and increased travel by powerful vehicles and built-up infrastructure rather than stumbling over rocks. That being said, the spirit of the game remains much the same, wandering the world to connect and deliver between isolated settlements while an\u2026 eccentric narrative holds the experience together.\nBelow we've got a full hub of all the most essential guides for Death Stranding 2, explaining everything from the best guns to hidden secrets and guides to challenges missions, as well as info about the cast, story and more besides!\nOur Death Stranding 2 hub was last updated on June 26, 2025 to include the latest guides and reflect the game's release to the world!\nDeath Stranding 2 review\nYou can read our full Death Stranding 2 review to see what we thought about Hideo Kojima's second go at a cargo delivery epic. This game takes a lot more cues from Metal Gear Solid compared to the first Death Stranding \"for better and worse\", but our reviewer really enjoyed the expanded worldbuilding, exploration, and sense of community that comes from online play and the Magellan crew.\nDeath Stranding 2 platforms and engine\nDeath Stranding 2 is a PS5-exclusive so you can currently only play the game on Sony's console. However, given the track record of the first game and its Director's Cut, we reckon that the chances of seeing Death Stranding 2 on PC and Xbox aren't as low as you might think, but be prepared to wait a long time.\nThe game is also powered by Decima, the proprietary game engine created by Guerrilla Games. Previously used for Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West, and the original Death Stranding, this engine helps these games run smoothly and look fantastic, provably across a range of hardware too. And if you're wondering how all the characters look so life-like, that's thanks to Epic Games' MetaHuman technology.\nDeath Stranding 2 story, cast, and ending\nDeath Stranding 2 carries on the story of the first game dragging Sam Porter Bridges into yet another continent-spanning, network-expanding, cargo-delivering journey. Do you need to play Death Stranding 1 before 2? It'll obviously help but it's not essential.\nSet 11 months after the Death Stranding 1 ending, Sam lives a reclusive life in Mexico with Lou, no longer ferrying cargo as a porter partly due to the rise of the Automated Porter Assistance System.\nFragile then finds Sam and persuades him to join her new reconnection outfit, Drawbridge, convincing him to help her connect Mexico to the UCA's Chiral Network. However, after learning more about Drawbridge and the existence of a plate gate linking Mexico to Australia, it's clear that Sam's simple hike through Mexico is really a small part of a much larger effort, and there are plenty of threats to face down under with plenty of new and returning characters - we've explained who plays who in the Death Stranding 2 cast here.\nIt's a twisting and intriguing story that is also incredibly bizarre and confusing at times, particularly the closer you get to the end. If you need help understanding the conclusion or just want to know how this game wraps up, check out our Death Stranding 2 ending explained guide.\nDeath Stranding 2 basics, tips and gameplay essentials\nIf you want to start with the basics of DS2, we've got the fundamentals covered below to help you get off to a good start, including how essential mechanics work and what secret pieces of advice we wish we'd known before going in.\n- How long is Death Stranding 2? If you want to know what's ahead of you in terms of time investment and commitment, we've explained how long it'll take for you to complete the game, including the difference in time between those who are just in it for the story, and those who are committed completionists.\n- Death Stranding 2 tips: This is all the advice we wish we'd known before we started playing, not just reiterations of tutorials, but helpful tricks learned through experience and time in the game.\n- Death Stranding 2 birthday: One of the first things you'll do in the game is enter your birthday, but what does that do? What's the point? And what happens when you log into the game during your birthday? We'll explain all that here.\n- Death Stranding 2 Likes: Social media is alive and well in this post-apocalyptic world, but what are all these Likes actually doing for you, and what happens when you like somebody else's sign or buildings?\nDeath Stranding 2 combat and weapons\nNow that you know the basics of playing Death Stranding 2, it's time to get yourself set up and equipped accordingly with the best weapons to take on all manner of foes, but notably the horrifying Beached Things:\n- Best Death Stranding 2 weapons: Firearms are how you turn the tide against your foes in DS2, and we've got the best weapons and guns listed here, how you get them, as well as the best armaments for fighting BTs, humans and mechs alike!\n- Death Stranding 2 BTs: The ghostly horrors of Death Stranding 2 are called BTs, or \"Beached Things\", and there are several different types, all posing different risks and perils. We've explained how to beat them all in the linked article to make you into a bonafide ghostbuster.\n- How to kill the first Death Stranding 2 BT boss: The first boss of the game found in Mexico is a huge step up in challenge compared to your first BT encounter, so we'll show you how to beat it and what you need to know.\n- Death Stranding 2 pizza martial arts: Yes, you read that right. Make the right choices and find the right locations, and you can unlock a hidden series of acrobatic karate moves themed around making pizza\u2026 and also around beating people up. If you want to know how, our guide will show you.\nDeath Stranding 2 exploration and vehicles\nDeath Stranding 2 unsurpsingly features a lot of walking, taking in the wilderness vistas as you deliver cargo to various people and places. However, wandering can be a real chore sometimes, particularly if you're hauling a lot in one go, but there are several forms of transport and travel that make deliveries much easier:\n- Death Stranding 2 vehicles: There are a few options for vehicles that players can use in On the Beach, including a speedy bike, a robust truck, and a complex monorail system. We've got them all listed here!\n- How to fast travel in Death Stranding 2: There are actually several fast travel systems in DS2, including Beach Jumps, moving your hub base, and using hot springs\u2026? We'll explain them all and what the benefits and costs of each are here.\nDeath Stranding 2 settlements, delivery points, and key locations\nThe biggest challenges in Death Stranding 2 tend to be based around finding optional Prepper bunkers and delivery points, which we've got listed below!\n- Death Stranding 2 Bokka: Found in Mexico, this optional character can provide all kinds of new gear towards exploration and package delivery.\n- Death Stranding 2 Artist: Further up in the Mexican mountains, the Artist helps you learn new ways to customize your gear and appearance, if you can get your climbing boots ready.\n- Death Stranding 2 Lone Commander: Having made it to Australia, the Lone Commander is hidden behind a minefield of BTs, but if you can reach them, there's some powerful weapons ready and waiting.\n- Death Stranding 2 Inventor: A recluse living on an island in the sea, the Inventor provides all kinds of fun tech \u2013 though they're not easy to reach or to unlock.\n- Death Stranding 2 mine locations: You won't be delivering things to these mines, but you should certainly visit and spend resources to get them rebuilt. Doing so means you can extract and farm materials of all types granting you huge amounts of materials for building\u2026 well, whatever you want. We'll show you where to find all the mines here, as it's by far the quickest way to farm resources.\nDeath Stranding 2 choices and puzzles\nDeath Stranding 2 has numerous puzzles and divergent choices, though ultimately this isn't a story that's going to split and change drastically depending on what you choose to do like it's an old Telltale game. Still, it's worth understanding what's being put in front of you, with them all laid out in chronological order below.\n- Death Stranding 2 I won't do it choice: When first meeting Fragile, you're offered a job \u2013 but what happens if you say no? We'll explain the consequences of either accepting or declining that offer at the attached page.\n- Death Stranding 2 Charlie's face choice: Charlie serves as a kind of representative avatar for a character who calls in from time to time, and when first met, you'll be able to choose a face and voice for them. Which is the right one?\n- Death Stranding 2 Motherhood passcode: When first reaching The Motherhood bunker, a passcode is required to enter \u2013 but don't worry, it's actually one you have all the info to find out on you. We'll explain the solution to figuring out this puzzle so you can get inside.\n- Rainy and Tomorrow's puzzles and questions: These two characters offer you various challenges, puzzles and tests throughout your time in the hub area, coming up with periodic challenges and choices for you. We've laid them all out below in the order you encounter them.\nDeath Stranding 2 is one of the biggest new games for 2025, but Kojima Productions also has even more in the oven, so look out for more on these upcoming Hideo Kojima games over the next few years.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nJoel Franey is a writer, journalist, podcaster and raconteur with a Masters from Sussex University, none of which has actually equipped him for anything in real life. As a result he chooses to spend most of his time playing video games, reading old books and ingesting chemically-risky levels of caffeine.

      "text": "Hideo Kojima says Metal Gear spiritual successor Physint is still \"another five or six years\" away, and that he may finally direct a movie after\nNo mention of OD though\nHideo Kojima has told a French magazine that his upcoming Metal Gear spiritual successor, Physint, is still \"another five or six years\" away.\nHideo Kojima is weeks away from launching his studio's next game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, but from the looks of things, he's already planned out the next 10-or-so years of his life (and planned out ideas to leave behind after he's gone). After the Death Stranding sequel, there are two more upcoming Hideo Kojima games currently announced: OD, an upcoming horror game that's being made in partnership with director Jordan Peele for Xbox Game Studios, and Physint, a new entry in the \"action-espionage\" genre (so basically, a Metal Gear spiritual successor).\nPhysint was confirmed at the end of a State of Play last January, but there hasn't been any news on it since then. With Death Stranding 2 and OD in the way, many assumed it would be a while away yet, and now Kojima has given a rough idea of when we can expect it.\nIn an interview with French magazine Le Film Francais posted by Kojima's assistant @kaizerkunkun on Twitter (and translated by ResetEra user Red Kong XIX), Kojima dropped some info about Physint when asked if he would like to direct a film. \"Besides Death Stranding 2, there's also Physint in development.\" Kojima said, adding, \"That will take me another five or six years. But maybe after that, I could finally decide to take on a film.\"\nSo, unfortunately it looks like we'll be playing Physint in 2031 at the earliest. What's interesting is that Kojima didn't mention OD. Kojima mentioned that both it and Physint faced delays due to the 2024 SAG strike, but he hasn't given any indication as to when OD will be released. If I had to guess, OD will likely release before Physint, and he will probably start revealing more about it once Death Stranding 2 has released.\nDeath Stranding 2 isn't weird enough: Hideo Kojima has an idea for a game where your character forgets everything if you stop playing.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nScott has been freelancing for over three years across a number of different gaming publications, first appearing on GamesRadar+ in 2024. He has also written for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, VG247, Play, TechRadar, and others. He's typically rambling about Metal Gear Solid, God Hand, or any other PS2-era titles that rarely (if ever) get sequels.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Hideo Kojima's OD: Everything we know so far\nThe latest OD news and updates from Hideo Kojima as we await more on the upcoming horror \"experience\"\nOD is one of the most mysterious and intriguing projects in the works from Hideo Kojima. Described as a new \"one-of-a-kind experience\" that's being made with Xbox Game Studios, OD - which is also known as Overdoes - was first revealed in 2023 with a teaser trailer that caused a lot of speculation in its wake, including some theories surrounding a possible nod to Silent Hill.\nFollowing the release of the long awaited sequel, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, OD is one of a few upcoming Hideo Kojima games confirmed to be on the way. There's still quite a lot of mystery surrounding what this new game, but we do know it promises to \"explore the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to overdoes on fear\", which certainly sounds like one very unsettling concept for an upcoming horror game.\nSet to make use of Microsoft's Cloud gaming technology, with some big names said to be attached, we've brought together everything we know so far about this big upcoming Xbox Series X game. From the gameplay experience, to the teaser, and more, read on below for a full overview of OD from Hideo Kojima.\nOD (Overdose) gameplay experience\nAt least when creative director Hideo Kojima was working on Metal Gear Solid games, you sort of knew what you were getting \u2013 cinematic stealth action. But as soon as he started to stretch into other franchises and new IP, his work became more difficult to anticipate. P.T. was a masterclass in looping psychological horror, Death Stranding, an oddly esoteric game about hiking through an apocalypse, and then there's OD.\nKojima himself has said that he is \"creating a very unique, immersive, and totally new style of game \u2013 or rather, a new form of media.\" The first teaser trailer ends with a sting claiming that Overdose will be \"for all the players and screamers.\" There's a lot to unravel here, so let's start with genre, as that's easier to figure out: OD will be a horror. Kojima Productions says that \"OD explores the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to OD on fear.\"\nOkay, so that's a start. The studio also says that it will do this \"while blurring the boundaries of gaming and film\", which is where things start getting a little more complicated. At The Game Awards, Kojima reaffirmed that OD \"is a game, don't get me wrong\" but then went on to note that \"at the same time, it's a movie; and at the same time, it's a new form of media.\"\nIt does sound a tad confusing, which is likely why Academy Award winning filmmaker Jordan Peele (Get Out, Us, Nope) has come on board to collaborate. In fact, Kojima later revealed Peele is just one of \"several talented storytellers involved in the project\", with a host of big names said to be attached in a group he refers to as 'The Avengers'. We don't yet know any more names involved in the project (beyond the actors mentioned below), but Kojima teases that whenever he shows the list of people who are a part of OD to his agents and managers \"they can hardly believe it's true\". How curious.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nA very bizarre leak in 2022 wasn't all that helpful in figuring out what style of play we should anticipate here, but it could blend some degree of active and passive play \u2013 owing to the fact that Overdrive development is being driven through a partnership with Microsoft Gaming, leveraging the power of Xbox Cloud Gaming for development.\nThe speculation game is actually quite important to these sort of weird creative endeavors - which is something we touch in our article exploring just why The Xbox Game Studios and Kojima Productions partnership is important. Kojima says he wants to \"make something nobody has seen before\" \u2013 we know that it'll be a horror, and that it'll blur the line between games and film, but exactly what shape that will take remains to be seen. And we likely won't see anything more for a while yet.\nOD cast\nHideo Kojima has unveiled the actors who will take starring roles in OD, although he is yet to confirm the names of the characters that they will eventually play. It's likely to be a little while before we learn more about the OD cast, but you can find the current list of will star in the project here:\n- Sophia Lillis (Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves)\n- Hunter Schaffer (Euphoria)\n- Udo Kier (Flesh for Frankenstein)\nOD teaser trailer\nThe first OD trailer was unveiled at The Game Awards 2023. The short teaser shows three of the core cast in what appears to effectively be motion-capture screen tests \u2013 floating heads on a black background, rendered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and MetaHuman technologies, as the eyes illuminate the lights and camera in front of them. You can watch the first teaser trailer for Hideo Kojima's OD above.\nOD expected release date and platforms\nThe OD release date is still likely to be years away at this point. Creative director Hideo Kojima is certainly focused on development of Death Stranding 2 right now, with this upcoming Xbox Series X game expected to follow after. Kojima Productions and Xbox Game Studios announced their collaboration in 2022, explaining that the two development houses were working to utilize the power of the cloud. What that means for platforms is anybody's guess, but I'd suspect that it will land on Xbox Series X, PC, and mobile devices via Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Game Pass.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

      "text": "All upcoming Hideo Kojima games: Everything in development at Kojima Productions\nFrom OD to Physint, there's no shortage of upcoming Hideo Kojima games heading to PS5 and Xbox Series X\nThere are currently two upcoming Hideo Kojima games in the works, with confirmation that we'll have some intriguing projects to look forward to. This is great news, as one of the biggest PS5 exclusives has now been released, with Death Stranding 2. Yes, although the sequel to Death Stranding has only just launched, there's already some other exciting new games that we know Kojima is cooking up - even if they'll be a little ways off as of right now.\nAs one of the most established developers, Kojima is best known as the creator and director of the Metal Gear series, but he also has credits working on a plethora of games over the years, from directing classics like Snatcher and the Policenauts, to producing Konami's Zone of the Enders and MercurySteam's Castevania reboot. Not to mention, Kojima also got game design credits under his belt for Boktai: The Sun, and who could forget the horror direction he may have gone in P.T. and Silent Hills. His most recent release was also fantastic, which our Death Stranding 2 review can attest to, so anything he touches is worth your attention.\nAlongside a mysterious upcoming PS5 game, we also have a very curious upcoming Xbox Series X game in development from Kojima Productions. With plenty to keep track of, read on below to find a full recap of everything you need to know about all of the upcoming Hideo Kojima games that have been revealed.\nOD\nDeveloper: Kojima Productions\nPlatform(s): Xbox Series X\nRelease date: TBC\nWhile Death Stranding would eventually land on PC and Xbox Series X, Hideo Kojima has been primarily working in collaboration with publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment ever since his splinter with Konami in 2019. That's all set to change with OD, an upcoming horror game that's being made in partnership with Xbox Game Studios. We know that Hideo Kojima will serve as writer, director, and producer of this new creative endeavor as he explores \"what it means to overdose on fear.\"\nGet Out and Us director Jordan Peel has also contributed as a writer on the project, and more big names are said to be attached to the game that haven't been revealed just yet. OD remains something of a mystery, but we know that Kojima is leveraging Xbox's Cloud Gaming technology to \"take on the challenge of creating a very unique, immersive, and totally new style of game\" that he has tapped actors Sophia Lillis Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier to star in.\nPhysint\nDeveloper: Kojima Productions\nPlatform(s): PS5\nRelease date: TBC\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOnce Hideo Kojima is clear of his commitments with Death Stranding 2 and OD, the famed creator will be making his \"return to the action-espionage genre\" with Physint. Announced in January 2024, there is very little known about this new action-espionage game \u2013 you know, the genre that Kojima helped pioneer through his Metal Gear series \u2013 although it will be a PS5 exclusive.\nThe collaboration was announced by Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, with Kojima going on to note that this will be a brand new IP and that it will be the \"culmination\" of his work in the industry thus far, blending \"cutting-edge technology and talent from around the world to create it.\" In fact, Kojima said it will \"transcend the barrier between films and video games\", and later teased you could be mistaken for watching a movie while playing it. It's intriguing stuff, but we'll likely be in for quite a wait for it to arrive, with the director stating it's still another five or six years away.\nDeath Stranding: Director's Cut is considered to be one of the best PS5 games to play right now. Go check it out, or go back to our original Death Stranding review to learn more about the game before diving into the newly released sequel.\nJosh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.
