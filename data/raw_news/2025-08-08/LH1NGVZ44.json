  "title": "GOP Texas map has Austin residents sharing district with rural Texans 300 miles away",
  "description": "It would \"suppress the votes of Black and brown Austinites,\" one Democrat said.",
  "content": "As Texas Republicans try to muscle a rare mid-decade redistricting bill through the Legislature to help Republicans gain seats in Congress -- at President Donald Trump's request -- residents in Austin, the state capital, could find themselves sharing a district with rural Texans more than 300 miles away.\n\nThe proposed map chops up Central Texas' 37th Congressional District, which is currently represented by Democrat Rep. Lloyd Doggett, will be consumed by four neighboring districts, three of which Republicans now hold.\n\nOne of those portions of the Austin-area district was drawn to be part of the 11th District that Republican Rep. August Pfluger represents, which stretches into rural Ector County, about 20 miles away from the New Mexico border.\n\nRural congressional districts, where people often live further apart, tend to be larger because districts are intended to have roughly the same number of residents so one American\u2019s vote is not more diluted than another\u2019s. Further, fellow rural voters are likelier to share demographic similarities with each other than with urban voters.\n\nThat would mean people in that area would share a congressman with people who live more than 311 miles away, a distance that is about 15 times more than that between them and those who currently live the farthest away.\n\n\"If you look at many of these districts, whether they're here or elsewhere in the nation, you do not necessarily see a community of interest,\" Sherri Greenberg, the assistant dean for the LBJ School of Public Affairs at UT Austin told ABC News. \"You don't see the following, for instance, county lines or city lines. You see perhaps along skinny districts, or districts that look like a piece of pie where you are not keeping communities together or interests together.\"\n\nGreenberg, asked what the new map means for the 37th district, said, \"you're spreading thin across many, many miles, with different cities, counties, communities, different interests, different topography, geography, culture, potentially.\"\n\nGreenberg served in the Texas House as a Democrat in the 1990s.\n\nRedistricting is an exercise that state legislatures participate in after the decennial census, accounting for population shifts across the country, and doing so in the years between a census is rare. But the White House in June approached Texas Republicans about redrawing the map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, to protect their fragile majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington.\n\nLast month, President Trump said he was looking for \"a very simple redrawing; we pick up five seats.\"\n\nDavid Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report, told ABC News that the proposed map could lead Democrats on a \"collision course,\" finding themselves competing for the remaining Democratic-leaning district in their area. One such showdown could happen in Austin between Doggett and Rep. Greg Casar.\n\nDemocrats have slammed the draft map as being \"rigged,\" a \"power grab,\" and \"racist\" and Texas House legislators have fled the state to preclude Republicans of the quorum needed to pass it.\n\n\"They're trying to suppress the votes of Black and brown Austinites right now under this map,\" Casar said Monday at a protest outside the Texas governor's residence. \"We won't let that happen, because if they're able to suppress the votes of Austinites under Trump's plan, soon enough, they'll try to suppress the votes of all Americans.\"\n\nWasserman said he estimates the proposed map would help Republicans pick up three to five additional seats in Texas by spreading out minority voters.\n\n\"This map would clearly impair the voting strength of Texas' minority voters,\" Wasserman said. \"It dilutes or eliminates districts where minority voters have elected Democrats in recent years.\"\n\nBut Greenberg and Wasserman said Democrats may face an uphill battle in court because of voting trends that show Latinos shifting toward conservatives, making it harder to argue that drawing them out of Democratic districts prevent them from voting for who they want.\n\n\"Republicans will make the case in court that Hispanic voters no longer constitute a cohesive political group because they've migrated so much towards Donald Trump, and that could really weaken Democrats' argument in court that those performing districts deserve protection,\" Wasserman said.\n\n\"These new districts reflect the population and the voting trends of Texas,\" Tepper said. \"We are a vast and very heavily Republican state, conservative state, and we deserve some more consideration sending our delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSeveral of the protesting Texas state lawmakers' Democratic allies in blue states have vowed to pursue redrawing congressional lines in their own states, including California, to shore up Democrats' numbers and counter what is happening in Texas.\n\nIf Texas changes its maps mid-decade, and other states follow suit over the next few years, Greenberg says the constant changes could lead to chaos.\n\n\"If you're having constant redistricting, it would be chaos. I mean, for people to run, they have to have -- know their districts. For, you know constituents who are voting, they need to know who they're voting for. If you are having all over the nation this constant redistricting every year, I don't know how that works.\"",

      "text": "Texas governor orders police to find and arrest Democrats who fled over redistricting\nIt's unclear if Texas could coordinate with law enforcement in other states.\nTexas House Republicans on Monday voted 85-6 to authorize the House sergeant-at-arms and related officers to track down and civilly arrest Democrats who fled the state in protest of GOP redistricting efforts.\n\"The sergeant-at-arms and any officers appointed by her are directed to send for all absentees whose attendance is not excused for the purposes of securing and maintaining their attendance under warrant of arrest, if necessary, until further order of the House,\" said Republican Rep. Dustin Burrows, the speaker of the Texas House of Representatives.\nShortly after the vote, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to find and arrest the Democrats who fled the state, an order which will remain in effect until they are \"accounted for and brought back\" to Austin.\nThe warrants, however, have no power outside state lines and it's unclear to what extent, if at all, Texas law enforcement may and could coordinate with their counterparts in the relevant states.\nLater Monday, Abbott said he had asked the Texas Rangers to investigate the Democrats who left the state for potential law violations \u2014 including bribery for soliciting funds to support their effort.\n\"Reports indicate that many absentee Texas House Democrats have solicited or received funds to evade conducting legislative business and casting votes. Under the Texas Penal Code, any of those Democrats who solicit, accept, or agree to accept such funds to assist in the violation of legislative duties or for purposes of skipping a vote may have violated bribery laws. Also, it could be a bribery violation for any other person who offers, provides, or agrees to provide such funds to fleeing Democrat House members,\" the governor said in a statement.\nThe move comes amid a showdown over a Republican-led effort, backed by President Donald Trump, to create a new congressional map with control of the U.S. House potentially at stake.\nAbbott had given Texas House Democrats a deadline of 3 p.m. local time on Monday to return to the statehouse for the special session or risk losing their jobs. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton suggested Democrats who left should be arrested and forcibly brought back, though he later admitted that would be a \"challenge.\"\nPaxton said in a statement late Monday afternoon that he is \"prepared to do everything in my power\" to hold the Democrats accountable for abdicating their duties in the House and for having \"sacrificed their constituents for a publicity stunt.\"\nThe response from the Texas House Democratic Caucus to Abbott's threat was, \"Come and take it.\"\nTexas House members who left the state were slated to hold various events throughout the day Monday in Democrat-led states.\nThe proposed congressional map could create up to five new Republican seats and help the party keep control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections. Consideration of the bill had been set for Monday, but couldn't proceed as the missing Democrats denied a quorum.\nDemocrats hold events in New York, Massachusetts and Illinois\nThe first news conference with Texas Democrats on Monday was with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in Albany. Hochul's message for Texas House Democrats was, \"You are on the right side of history. And you're not alone.\"\n\"As I said, history will judge us and how we respond to this moment. But here in New York, we will not stand on the sidelines with the timid souls on the sidelines who don't care and will not invest their heart and soul into this battle. This is a war,\" Hochul continued. \"We are at war and that's why the gloves are off. And I say, bring it on.\"\nHochul said that she would seek to disband or change New York's independent redistricting commission through a constitutional amendment in response to Texas -- but admitted that doing so would not be possible before the 2028 election. Under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Yorkers passed a constitutional amendment in 2014 prohibiting partisan redistricting.\nTexas House Democrats who have gone to Massachusetts for the National Conference of State Legislators summit will hold a press conference in Boston on Monday afternoon. Then, Texas House Democrats who have gathered in Illinois will hold a press conference with Democratic members of Congress in Chicago on Monday night.\nDuring a press conference at the IBEW union hall in Warrenville, Illinois, Texas Democratic lawmakers said they're prepared to \"fight,\" and asked blue states to back their effort.\n\"We've got our sleeves rolled up, and we're ready to take this fight wherever it's going to take us, because our communities, our state and our nation -- is definitely worth fighting for it,\" state Rep. Jessica Ramos said.\nState Rep. John Bucy III said they left the state because they would not \"play along\" with Republicans' redistricting plans.\n\"Look, I didn't run for office to walk out of the Capitol, but I also didn't run for office to stand by while democracy is stolen in broad daylight,\" Bucy said. \"Texas Democrats broke quorum because sometimes the only way to uphold your oath is to refuse to play along with a rigged game.\"\nAnd the lawmakers were adamant they weren't running away.\n\"We're not running from anything. We're trying to make sure that when democracy is in Texas, it is going to be of the people, by the people and for the people,\" state Rep. Harold V. Dutton, Jr. said.\nTexas State Rep. James Talarico, a Democrat, spoke with ABC News from Illinois and confirmed he plans to stay out of the state for the remaining two weeks of the special session.\n\"To be gone from my family, from my state, is not a happy thing for me. But why I am doing this is because the Republicans are trying to change the rules of the game midway through the decade,\" Talarico told ABC News Correspondent Jay O'Brien.\nTalarico also characterized the Republican redistricting effort as a ploy by Trump to rig the election.\n\"It is rock bottom for people like Greg Abbott and Donald Trump. Sadly, I've come to expect nothing less from them, but it is still immoral and disgusting and outrageous, and we should all reject it regardless of our political party,\" Talarico added.\nAbbott, Paxton threaten action against Democrats\nAbbott, in his warning to Texas House Democrats, said leaving the state in protest amounted to \"abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office.\"\nThe governor said if they didn't return by 3 p.m. local time on Monday, he would invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House. He further went on to claim the lawmakers who left \"may also have committed felonies\" by fundraising in order to pay the $500 fine they risk accruing each day they are absent.\n\"Our fellow Texans are being let down and not getting the flood relief they need, because these Democrats have absconded from the responsibility, and I believe they have forfeited their seats in the state legislature because they're not doing the job they were elected to do,\" Abbott said during an interview with Fox News on Monday.\nPaxton, in a social media post, wrote that \"Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately. We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.\"\nWhat's at stake\nThe new congressional map was proposed by Texas Republicans following a push by Trump for maps more favorable to Republicans to help the party keep the majority in the House in 2026. Currently, House Republicans are operating with a narrow majority.\nTrump has said he wants Republicans to pick up five new seats in Texas and others around the country. Democrats have slammed the move and said it risks hurting minority voters.\nAsked by Fox News why he is pushing for new districts, Abbott said it is partly to dismantle \"coalition districts\" (where racial minority groups together make up most of the population) and to redraw districts based on political considerations.\n\"Gerrymandering can be done or drawing lines can be done on the basis of political makeup, as in Republican versus Democrat, and there's nothing illegal about that,\" Abbott said. \"And then when you look at the outcome of the most recent presidential election, all these districts that are being added are districts that were won by Trump.\"\nTexas' redistricting effort has prompted some Democrat-led states to investigate similar moves to \"fight fire with fire,\" as California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has said. Newsom is considering calling a special session on redistricting in November to make the state's congressional map more Democrat-friendly. Newsom said Monday that California Democrats have or are nearly done with a draft of a new map.\n\"Whatever they are doing [in Texas] will be neutered here in the state of California, and they will pay that price,\" Newsom said.\nAs the redistricting battle heats up, a House Republican will introduce legislation to ban mid-decade redrawing of congressional maps nationwide.\nCalifornia GOP Rep. Kevin Kiley will formally introduce the bill on Tuesday which will \"nullify new maps adopted by states before the 2030 census, including any that are adopted this year.\" The bill's future remains uncertain, however, as it's unlikely to be backed by House Republican leadership.\nABC News' Lauren Peller contributed to this report."
