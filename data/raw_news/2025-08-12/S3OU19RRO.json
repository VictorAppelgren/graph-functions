  "content": "A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after positive inflation data fueled hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation rose by a modest 0.2% in July and 2.7% over the last year. This cooler-than-expected data prompted a significant market rally, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all climbing as investors grew more optimistic. The prevailing view is that easing inflation gives the central bank room to lower interest rates. Lower rates typically reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds, contributing to widespread gains across sectors like healthcare.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\u2022 Medical Devices & Supplies - Specialty company Inspire Medical Systems (NYSE:INSP) jumped 3%.

Is now the time to buy Dentsply Sirona? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nUFP Technologies\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 11.9% on the news that the company posted record second-quarter results and beat analyst profit expectations. The medical products company reported a 37.2% surge in sales to $151.2 million compared to the same period last year. Its adjusted earnings per share reached $2.50, which surpassed Wall Street's consensus estimate of $2.25. This strong performance was primarily driven by a 46% jump in its MedTech business, fueled by demand in areas like robotic-assisted surgery. However, the results included a 20% decline in its Advanced Components division, and the company noted increased labor costs pressured margins.",

      "text": "Inspire Medical Systems (INSP)\nInspire Medical Systems is an exciting business. The explosive demand for its goods has resulted in sales volumes that competitors can only dream of.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Like Inspire Medical Systems\nOffering an alternative for the millions who struggle with traditional CPAP machines, Inspire Medical Systems (NYSE:INSP) develops and sells an implantable neurostimulation device that treats obstructive sleep apnea by stimulating nerves to keep airways open during sleep.\n- Annual revenue growth of 60.3% over the last five years was superb and indicates its market share increased during this cycle\n- Earnings per share grew by 22.5% annually over the last five years, massively outpacing its peers\n- Sales outlook for the upcoming 12 months implies the business will stay on its desirable two-year growth trajectory\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Inspire Medical Systems?\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy Is Now The Time To Buy Inspire Medical Systems?\nInspire Medical Systems is trading at $79.49 per share, or 26.8x forward P/E. Many healthcare names may carry a lower valuation multiple, but Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s price is fair given its business quality.\nOur analysis and backtests show it\u2019s often prudent to pay up for high-quality businesses because they routinely outperform the market over a multi-year period almost regardless of the entry price.\n3. Inspire Medical Systems (INSP) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nMedical technology company Inspire Medical Systems (NYSE:INSP) announced better-than-expected revenue in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 10.8% year on year to $217.1 million. On the other hand, the company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $905 million at the midpoint came in 4.6% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.12 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nInspire Medical Systems (INSP) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $217.1 million vs analyst estimates of $214.4 million (10.8% year-on-year growth, 1.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $44.11 million vs analyst estimates of $36.38 million (20.3% margin, 21.2% beat)\n- The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year to $905 million at the midpoint from $947.5 million, a 4.5% decrease because the \"U.S. commercial launch [of Inspire V] is progressing slower than expected, and the timeline to complete the full transition to Inspire V has been pushed forward, which will impact financial results for the year\"\n- EPS (GAAP) guidance for the full year is $0.45 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 80.1%\n- Operating Margin: -1.5%, down from 2.6% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $3.72 billion\nCompany Overview\nOffering an alternative for the millions who struggle with traditional CPAP machines, Inspire Medical Systems (NYSE:INSP) develops and sells an implantable neurostimulation device that treats obstructive sleep apnea by stimulating nerves to keep airways open during sleep.\nThe company's flagship product, the Inspire system, consists of three implantable components: a pressure sensing lead that detects breathing attempts, a neurostimulator containing electronics and battery, and a stimulation lead that delivers electrical pulses to the hypoglossal nerve. This stimulation causes a slight forward movement of the tongue, preventing airway collapse during sleep.\nInspire therapy targets patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who have failed or cannot tolerate positive airway pressure (PAP) treatments like CPAP machines. For these patients, the Inspire system offers a significant alternative to traditional treatments. A typical patient might be someone who has tried using a CPAP machine but found it uncomfortable or impractical for nightly use, leaving their sleep apnea untreated and putting them at risk for serious health complications.\nThe implantation procedure is typically performed by ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians or occasionally neurosurgeons as an outpatient procedure. Once implanted, patients use a remote control to activate the device before sleep and turn it off upon waking.\nInspire Medical Systems generates revenue by selling its systems to hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. The company has built a substantial sales organization focused on educating ENT physicians, sleep centers, and patients about its therapy. It also maintains a dedicated reimbursement team that helps patients navigate insurance coverage and prior authorization processes.\nThe company has secured coverage from most major U.S. commercial insurers and Medicare, representing a significant milestone in making the therapy accessible to patients. Internationally, Inspire has expanded beyond the U.S. into European markets, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, using a combination of direct sales forces and distributors.\n4. Medical Devices & Supplies - Specialty\nThe medical devices industry operates a business model that balances steady demand with significant investments in innovation and regulatory compliance. The industry benefits from recurring revenue streams tied to consumables, maintenance services, and incremental upgrades to the latest technologies, although specialty devices are more niche. The capital-intensive nature of product development, coupled with lengthy regulatory pathways and the need for clinical validation, can weigh on profitability and timelines. In addition, there are constant pricing pressures from healthcare systems and insurers maximizing cost efficiency. Over the next several years, one tailwind is demographic\u2013aging populations means rising chronic disease rates that drive greater demand for medical interventions and monitoring solutions. Advances in digital health, such as remote patient monitoring and smart devices, are also expected to unlock new demand by shortening upgrade cycles. On the other hand, the industry faces headwinds from pricing and reimbursement pressures as healthcare providers increasingly adopt value-based care models. Additionally, the integration of cybersecurity for connected devices adds further risk and complexity for device manufacturers.\nInspire Medical Systems competes with traditional sleep apnea treatment providers like ResMed (NYSE:RMD) and Philips Respironics (NYSE:PHG) that manufacture CPAP machines, as well as companies offering alternative surgical interventions for sleep apnea such as Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and LivaNova (NASDAQ:LIVN).\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $861.3 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Inspire Medical Systems is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive. On the bright side, Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s smaller revenue base allows it to grow faster if it can execute well.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Luckily, Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s sales grew at an incredible 60.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth surpassed the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 28% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nThis quarter, Inspire Medical Systems reported year-on-year revenue growth of 10.8%, and its $217.1 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 20.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is noteworthy and suggests the market is forecasting success for its products and services.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nInspire Medical Systems\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average operating margin of negative 4.4% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out.\nOn the plus side, Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s operating margin rose by 30.6 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Zooming in on its more recent performance, we can see the company\u2019s trajectory is intact as its margin has also increased by 15 percentage points on a two-year basis. These data points are very encouraging and show momentum is on its side.\nInspire Medical Systems\u2019s operating margin was negative 1.5% this quarter.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nInspire Medical Systems\u2019s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is a good sign and shows it\u2019s at an inflection point.\nIn Q2, Inspire Medical Systems reported EPS at negative $0.12, down from $0.32 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates, but we care more about long-term EPS growth than short-term movements. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.73 to grow 71.2%.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nInspire Medical Systems has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.7%, subpar for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s margin expanded by 35.9 percentage points during that time. The company\u2019s improvement shows it\u2019s heading in the right direction, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nCompanies with more cash than debt have lower bankruptcy risk.\nInspire Medical Systems is a well-capitalized company with $300.9 million of cash and $30.91 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $270 million net cash position is 7.3% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n11. Key Takeaways from Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was good to see Inspire Medical Systems narrowly top analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. The company also beat EBITDA expectations. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance was lowered and missed Wall Street's estimates. Additionally, full-year EPS guidance fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. This was due to a slower-than-expected launch and scaling of the new Inspire V product family. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 12.5% immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Inspire Medical Systems?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:12 AM EDT\nA common mistake we notice when investors are deciding whether to buy a stock or not is that they simply look at the latest earnings results. Business quality and valuation matter more, so we urge you to understand these dynamics as well.\nThere are several reasons why we think Inspire Medical Systems is a great business. For starters, its revenue growth was exceptional over the last five years. And while its operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other healthcare companies, its growth in domestic medical centers was surging. Additionally, Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s rising cash profitability gives it more optionality.\nInspire Medical Systems\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 26.8x. Looking across the spectrum of healthcare companies today, Inspire Medical Systems\u2019s fundamentals shine bright. We like the stock at this price.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $145.50 on the company (compared to the current share price of $79.49), implying they see 83% upside in buying Inspire Medical Systems in the short term."

Globus Medical (GMED) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nMedical device company Globus Medical (NYSE:GMED) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 18.4% year on year to $745.3 million. The company expects the full year\u2019s revenue to be around $2.85 billion, close to analysts\u2019 estimates.

The Musculoskeletal Solutions segment comprises implantable devices, biologics, surgical instruments, and neuromonitoring services used in spinal, orthopedic, and neurosurgical procedures. These products address conditions ranging from degenerative disorders to deformities, tumors, and traumatic injuries.\nThe company's spine products include traditional fusion implants like pedicle screw systems and plating systems, as well as innovative expandable solutions that can be customized during surgery. For orthopedic trauma, Globus offers solutions for fracture patterns in upper and lower extremities, including plates, screws, nails, and external fixation devices. The company also provides hip and knee replacement implants for degenerative conditions.\nA distinctive offering is Globus Medical's neuromonitoring service, which uses proprietary software to provide real-time feedback about nerve proximity during surgery. This technology translates complex neurophysiological data into simple information that helps surgeons navigate safely around nerves.\nThe Enabling Technologies category features advanced imaging, navigation, and robotics systems designed to enhance surgical precision. The ExcelsiusGPS platform, a robotic guidance and navigation system, supports minimally invasive procedures with applications for screw and interbody spacer placement. The company also offers Surgimap, a surgical planning software platform with predictive algorithms, and Excelsius3D, an imaging platform that provides three imaging modalities and can be integrated with the robotic navigation system.\nGlobus Medical sells its products primarily through an exclusive global sales force, with representatives often present in operating rooms during surgeries. The company invests significantly in surgeon education and training programs to demonstrate the benefits of its products and procedures, offering courses globally through both in-person and virtual formats.\nIn 2023, Globus Medical acquired NuVasive, a spine technology company, expanding its global reach and enhancing its product offerings. While the United States remains the primary market for Globus Medical's products, international sales accounted for approximately 18.4% of total sales in 2023.\n4. Medical Devices & Supplies - Specialty\nThe medical devices industry operates a business model that balances steady demand with significant investments in innovation and regulatory compliance. The industry benefits from recurring revenue streams tied to consumables, maintenance services, and incremental upgrades to the latest technologies, although specialty devices are more niche. The capital-intensive nature of product development, coupled with lengthy regulatory pathways and the need for clinical validation, can weigh on profitability and timelines. In addition, there are constant pricing pressures from healthcare systems and insurers maximizing cost efficiency. Over the next several years, one tailwind is demographic\u2013aging populations means rising chronic disease rates that drive greater demand for medical interventions and monitoring solutions. Advances in digital health, such as remote patient monitoring and smart devices, are also expected to unlock new demand by shortening upgrade cycles. On the other hand, the industry faces headwinds from pricing and reimbursement pressures as healthcare providers increasingly adopt value-based care models. Additionally, the integration of cybersecurity for connected devices adds further risk and complexity for device manufacturers.\nGlobus Medical's main competitors include Alphatec Holdings, Orthofix, Integra LifeSciences, and ZimVie, as well as larger medical device companies that operate in the musculoskeletal space such as Medtronic, Stryker, and Johnson & Johnson's DePuy Synthes.\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $2.63 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Globus Medical has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Luckily, Globus Medical\u2019s sales grew at an exceptional 28.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Globus Medical\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 54.7% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s sales dynamics by analyzing its constant currency revenue, which excludes currency movements that are outside their control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales averaged 62.3% year-on-year growth. Because this number is better than its normal revenue growth, we can see that foreign exchange rates have been a headwind for Globus Medical.\nThis quarter, Globus Medical reported year-on-year revenue growth of 18.4%, and its $745.3 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 0.7%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 14.8% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is healthy and suggests the market is baking in success for its products and services.\n7. Adjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. It also removes various one-time costs to paint a better picture of normalized profits.\nGlobus Medical has been an efficient company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the healthcare sector, boasting an average adjusted operating margin of 23.2%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Globus Medical\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 3.3 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 1.2 percentage points. We still like Globus Medical but would like to see some improvement in the future.\nIn Q2, Globus Medical generated an adjusted operating margin profit margin of 21.3%, down 3.2 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nGlobus Medical\u2019s EPS grew at an astounding 20.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Despite its adjusted operating margin improvement during that time, this performance was lower than its 28.6% annualized revenue growth, telling us that non-fundamental factors such as interest and taxes affected its ultimate earnings.\nWe can take a deeper look into Globus Medical\u2019s earnings quality to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Globus Medical\u2019s adjusted operating margin declined by 3.3 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 40%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\nIn Q2, Globus Medical reported adjusted EPS at $0.86, up from $0.75 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Globus Medical\u2019s full-year EPS of $3.21 to grow 6.5%.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nGlobus Medical has shown impressive cash profitability, giving it the option to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 14.9% over the last five years, better than the broader healthcare sector.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Globus Medical\u2019s margin dropped by 1.8 percentage points during that time. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle. We\u2019ll give the company the benefit of the doubt for now as its overall financial profile is still healthy.\nGlobus Medical\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $31.3 million in Q2, equivalent to a 4.2% margin. This cash profitability was in line with the comparable period last year but below its five-year average. We wouldn\u2019t read too much into it because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to short-term swings. Long-term trends are more important.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nGlobus Medical\u2019s management team makes decent investment decisions and generates value for shareholders. Its five-year average ROIC was 8.1%, slightly better than typical healthcare business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Globus Medical\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased significantly. Only time will tell if its new bets can bear fruit and potentially reverse the trend.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nGlobus Medical is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $229.4 million of cash and $105 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $124.5 million net cash position gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from Globus Medical\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Globus Medical beat analysts\u2019 constant currency revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance was in line. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock traded up 3.6% to $56.05 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Globus Medical?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:02 AM EDT\nWe think that the latest earnings result is only one piece of the bigger puzzle. If you\u2019re deciding whether to own Globus Medical, you should also grasp the company\u2019s longer-term business quality and valuation.\nGlobus Medical is a fine business. First off, its revenue growth was exceptional over the last five years. And while its diminishing returns show management's recent bets still have yet to bear fruit, its constant currency growth has been marvelous. On top of that, its astounding EPS growth over the last five years shows its profits are trickling down to shareholders.\nGlobus Medical\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 17.4x. Looking at the healthcare space right now, Globus Medical trades at a compelling valuation. For those confident in the business and its management team, this is a good time to invest.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $82.36 on the company (compared to the current share price of $59.50), implying they see 38.4% upside in buying Globus Medical in the short term."

      "text": "Neogen (NEOG)\nWe wouldn\u2019t recommend Neogen. Its weak sales growth and low returns on capital show it struggled to generate demand and profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Neogen Will Underperform\nFounded in 1981 and operating at the intersection of food safety and animal health, Neogen (NASDAQ:NEOG) develops and manufactures diagnostic tests and related products to detect dangerous substances in food and pharmaceuticals for animal health.\n- Performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were much less profitable, as its earnings per share fell by 10.2% annually\n- Suboptimal cost structure is highlighted by its history of adjusted operating margin losses\n- Short cash runway increases the probability of a capital raise that dilutes existing shareholders\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Neogen\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Neogen\nAt $5 per share, Neogen trades at 14x forward P/E. This multiple is lower than most healthcare companies, but for good reason.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with higher long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Neogen (NEOG) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nLife sciences company Neogen (NASDAQ:NEOG) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales fell by 4.8% year on year to $225.5 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $830 million at the midpoint came in 3.4% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.05 per share was 44.4% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nNeogen (NEOG) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $225.5 million vs analyst estimates of $222.5 million (4.8% year-on-year decline, 1.3% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.05 vs analyst expectations of $0.09 (miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $40.62 million vs analyst estimates of $40.8 million (18% margin, in line)\n- EBITDA guidance for the upcoming financial year 2026 is $170 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $162.8 million\n- Operating Margin: -271%, down from 5.5% in the same quarter last year due largely to ~$600 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related primarily to the acquisition of the former 3M Food Safety Division\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 0.2%, similar to the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.18 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1981 and operating at the intersection of food safety and animal health, Neogen (NASDAQ:NEOG) develops and manufactures diagnostic tests and related products to detect dangerous substances in food and pharmaceuticals for animal health.\nNeogen's business is divided into two main segments. The Food Safety segment provides diagnostic test kits that detect contaminants like foodborne pathogens, mycotoxins, allergens, and spoilage organisms in human food and animal feed. These tests help food producers ensure their products are safe for consumption. For example, a cookie manufacturer might use Neogen's allergen tests to verify that a production line is free from peanut residue before making a peanut-free product.\nThe Animal Safety segment offers a diverse range of products including veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, rodenticides, insecticides, cleaners, and disinfectants. This segment also provides genomic testing services that help livestock producers improve breeding decisions. A cattle rancher might use Neogen's genomic testing to identify animals with superior genetic traits for breeding purposes.\nNeogen's products are primarily consumable in nature \u2013 single-use test kits, culture media, and reagents that customers need to purchase repeatedly. The company sells directly to end users through specialized sales teams and also works with distributors to reach customers in over 100 countries.\nThe company generates revenue through the sale of its diagnostic kits, instruments, pharmaceuticals, and services. Its customers include food processors of all sizes (from small local grain elevators to multinational food corporations), regulatory agencies, veterinarians, livestock producers, and commercial laboratories.\nNeogen has expanded its global footprint through strategic acquisitions and now maintains operations in 24 countries outside the United States, with manufacturing facilities in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, and Brazil, and genomics laboratories across six countries.\n4. Medical Devices & Supplies - Diversified\nThe medical devices industry operates a business model that balances steady demand with significant investments in innovation and regulatory compliance. The industry benefits from recurring revenue streams tied to consumables, maintenance services, and incremental upgrades to the latest technologies. However, the capital-intensive nature of product development, coupled with lengthy regulatory pathways and the need for clinical validation, can weigh on profitability and timelines. In addition, there are constant pricing pressures from healthcare systems and insurers maximizing cost efficiency. Over the next several years, one tailwind is demographic\u2013aging populations means rising chronic disease rates that drive greater demand for medical interventions and monitoring solutions. Advances in digital health, such as remote patient monitoring and smart devices, are also expected to unlock new demand by shortening upgrade cycles. On the other hand, the industry faces headwinds from pricing and reimbursement pressures as healthcare providers increasingly adopt value-based care models. Additionally, the integration of cybersecurity for connected devices adds further risk and complexity for device manufacturers.\nNeogen's competitors in the food safety testing market include bioM\u00e9rieux (EPA:BIM), Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), and PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI). In the animal safety segment, the company competes with Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS), Elanco Animal Health (NYSE:ELAN), and Merck Animal Health, a division of Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK).\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $894.7 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Neogen is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Neogen grew its sales at a solid 16.4% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Neogen\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 4.3% over the last two years was below its five-year trend.\nThis quarter, Neogen\u2019s revenue fell by 4.8% year on year to $225.5 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.3%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 10.2% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds.\n7. Operating Margin\nNeogen\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average operating margin of negative 22.9% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Neogen\u2019s operating margin decreased significantly over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 123.2 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nIn Q2, Neogen generated a negative 271% operating margin due largely to ~$600 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related primarily to the acquisition of the former 3M Food Safety Division.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for Neogen, its EPS declined by 10.2% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 16.4%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nDiving into the nuances of Neogen\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Neogen\u2019s operating margin declined by 134.4 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 104%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\nIn Q2, Neogen reported EPS at $0.05, down from $0.10 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Neogen to perform poorly. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of $0.33 will hit $0.37.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nWhile Neogen\u2019s free cash flow broke even this quarter, the broader story hasn\u2019t been so clean. Neogen\u2019s demanding reinvestments have consumed many resources over the last five years, contributing to an average free cash flow margin of negative 1.4%. This means it lit $1.35 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Neogen\u2019s margin dropped by 16.8 percentage points during that time. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because it\u2019s already burning cash. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\nNeogen broke even from a free cash flow perspective in Q2. This cash profitability was in line with the comparable period last year and above its five-year average.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nNeogen\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 0.7%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Investors are likely hoping for a change soon.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Neogen\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\nThis quarter's drop is due largely to ~$600 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related primarily to the acquisition of the former 3M Food Safety Division.\n11. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nNeogen burned through $46.35 million of cash over the last year, and its $894.1 million of debt exceeds the $129 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nUnless the Neogen\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns.\nWe remain cautious of Neogen until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet.\n12. Key Takeaways from Neogen\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by Neogen\u2019s optimistic full-year revenue guidance, which exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations. On the other hand, its adjusted EPS missed. Overall, this print was mixed. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 2.7% to $5.28 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Neogen?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 11:22 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Neogen or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nNeogen falls short of our quality standards. Although its revenue growth was solid over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out. On top of that, the company\u2019s declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nNeogen\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 14x. This valuation tells us it\u2019s a bit of a market darling with a lot of good news priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $6.50 on the company (compared to the current share price of $5).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Dentsply Sirona\u2019s valuation may seem like a great deal, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s so cheap.\nCheap stocks can look like a great deal at first glance, but they can be value traps. They often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Dentsply Sirona (XRAY) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nDental products company Dentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 4.9% year on year to $936 million. The company\u2019s outlook for the full year was close to analysts\u2019 estimates with revenue guided to $3.65 billion at the midpoint. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.52 per share was 3.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nDentsply Sirona (XRAY) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $936 million vs analyst estimates of $932.9 million (4.9% year-on-year decline, in line)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.52 vs analyst estimates of $0.50 (3.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $197 million vs analyst estimates of $180.6 million (21% margin, 9.1% beat)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $3.65 billion at the midpoint\n- Management reiterated its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance of $1.90 at the midpoint\n- Operating Margin: -13.7%, down from 5.1% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 1.7%, down from 15.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Constant Currency Revenue fell 6.7% year on year (-2.4% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $2.73 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith roots dating back to 1877 when it introduced the first dental electric drill, Dentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY) manufactures and sells professional dental equipment, technologies, and consumable products used by dentists and specialists worldwide.\nDentsply Sirona operates through four main business segments that together form a comprehensive dental solutions ecosystem. The Connected Technology Solutions segment provides the digital backbone of modern dentistry, offering imaging equipment, treatment centers, and CAD/CAM technologies that enable same-day dental restorations. Their cloud-based platform, DS Core, connects these technologies to streamline workflows for dental practices.\nThe Essential Dental Solutions segment focuses on consumable products and small equipment used in everyday dental procedures. This includes endodontic tools for root canal treatments, restorative materials for prosthetic work, and preventive products like curing lights and ultrasonic scalers.\nThrough its Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment, the company offers dental implant systems, digital dentures, and clear aligner solutions. This includes both professional-directed aligners (SureSmile) and direct-to-consumer aligners (Byte), giving dentists and patients multiple treatment options.\nThe Wellspect Healthcare segment extends beyond dentistry, providing continence care solutions for urinary and bowel management, primarily through catheters and related products.\nDentsply Sirona maintains a global presence, distributing products in over 150 countries through a combination of third-party distributors and direct sales. Major dental supply distributors Henry Schein and Patterson Companies represent significant distribution channels for the company.\nThe company invests heavily in clinical education, operating 57 academies and education centers across 35 countries. These facilities provide training for dental professionals on new techniques and technologies, helping to drive adoption of the company's products while building relationships with practitioners.\nResearch and development remains a priority, with recent innovations including the DS Core cloud platform, 3D printing solutions, and enhanced implant systems. The company's products must comply with strict medical device regulations in all markets where they operate, including FDA requirements in the US and MDR standards in Europe.\n4. Dental Equipment & Technology\nThe dental equipment and technology industry encompasses companies that manufacture orthodontic products, dental implants, imaging systems, and digital tools for dental professionals. These companies benefit from recurring revenue streams tied to consumables, ongoing maintenance, and growing demand for aesthetic and restorative dentistry. However, high R&D costs, significant capital investment requirements, and reliance on discretionary spending make them vulnerable to economic cycles. Over the next few years, tailwinds for the sector include innovation in digital workflows, such as 3D printing and AI-driven diagnostics, which enhance the efficiency and precision of dental care. However, headwinds include economic uncertainty, which could reduce patient spending on elective procedures, regulatory challenges, and potential pricing pressures from consolidated dental service organizations (DSOs).\nDentsply Sirona's competitors include Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) in the clear aligner space, Envista Holdings (NYSE:NVST) for dental equipment and consumables, and Straumann Holding (SWX:STMN) in the dental implant market. The company also competes with 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Henry Schein's (NASDAQ:HSIC) private label products in various dental categories.\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $3.67 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Dentsply Sirona has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Unfortunately, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s 1.2% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was tepid. This was below our standards and is a tough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 3.4% annually.\nWe can better understand the company\u2019s sales dynamics by analyzing its constant currency revenue, which excludes currency movements that are outside their control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales averaged 2.9% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its normal revenue growth, we can see that Dentsply Sirona has properly hedged its foreign currency exposure.\nThis quarter, Dentsply Sirona reported a rather uninspiring 4.9% year-on-year revenue decline to $936 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months. Although this projection suggests its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n7. Operating Margin\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average operating margin of negative 5.8% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operating margin decreased by 41 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nIn Q2, Dentsply Sirona generated a negative 13.7% operating margin. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s unimpressive 1.4% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. On the bright side, this tells us its incremental sales were profitable.\nIn Q2, Dentsply Sirona reported adjusted EPS at $0.52, up from $0.49 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 3.2%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Dentsply Sirona\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.71 to grow 13.6%.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nDentsply Sirona has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 9.3% over the last five years, slightly better than the broader healthcare sector.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Dentsply Sirona\u2019s margin dropped by 11.9 percentage points during that time. Continued declines could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $16 million in Q2, equivalent to a 1.7% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 14.1 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 8.1%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased significantly. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nDentsply Sirona reported $359 million of cash and $2.49 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $663 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Dentsply Sirona\u2019s 3.2\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $29 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Dentsply Sirona\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was good to see Dentsply Sirona narrowly top analysts\u2019 full-year EPS guidance expectations this quarter. We were also happy its EPS outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its constant currency revenue missed. Zooming out, we think this was a mixed quarter. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 4.6% to $13.04 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Dentsply Sirona?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 11:53 PM EDT\nBefore investing in or passing on Dentsply Sirona, we urge you to understand the company\u2019s business quality (or lack thereof), valuation, and the latest quarterly results - in that order.\nDentsply Sirona falls short of our quality standards. First off, its revenue growth was uninspiring over the last five years, and analysts don\u2019t see anything changing over the next 12 months. And while its sturdy operating margins show it has disciplined cost controls, the downside is its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out. On top of that, its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 6.4x. While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is huge given its shaky fundamentals. There are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $16.93 on the company (compared to the current share price of $12.62).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

      "text": "UFP Technologies (UFPT)\nUFP Technologies doesn\u2019t excite us. It\u2019s recently struggled to grow its revenue, a worrying sign for investors seeking high-quality stocks.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy UFP Technologies Is Not Exciting\nWith expertise dating back to 1963 in specialized materials and precision manufacturing, UFP Technologies (NASDAQ:UFPT) designs and manufactures custom solutions for medical devices, sterile packaging, and other highly engineered products for healthcare and industrial applications.\n- Revenue base of $588.6 million puts it at a disadvantage compared to larger competitors exhibiting economies of scale\n- The good news is that its performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were extremely profitable, as its annual earnings per share growth of 32.8% outpaced its revenue gains\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than UFP Technologies\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than UFP Technologies\nAt $218.99 per share, UFP Technologies trades at 21.5x forward P/E. Not only does UFP Technologies trade at a premium to companies in the healthcare space, but this multiple is also high for its fundamentals.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. UFP Technologies (UFPT) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nMedical products company UFP Technologies (NASDAQ:UFPT) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 37.2% year on year to $151.2 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.50 per share was 11.1% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nUFP Technologies (UFPT) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $151.2 million vs analyst estimates of $151.6 million (37.2% year-on-year growth, in line)\n- Adjusted EPS: $2.50 vs analyst estimates of $2.25 (11.1% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $31.84 million vs analyst estimates of $30.35 million (21.1% margin, 4.9% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 16.1%, down from 17.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.75 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith expertise dating back to 1963 in specialized materials and precision manufacturing, UFP Technologies (NASDAQ:UFPT) designs and manufactures custom solutions for medical devices, sterile packaging, and other highly engineered products for healthcare and industrial applications.\nUFP Technologies primarily serves the medical technology sector, creating components that are critical to surgical procedures, patient care, and medical device functionality. The company specializes in converting specialty materials into custom-engineered solutions that meet specific performance requirements. For example, a hospital might use UFP's protective drapes during robotic surgery procedures to maintain sterile fields and prevent infections.\nThe company's medical product portfolio includes disposables for surgical procedures, infection prevention materials, advanced wound care solutions, and packaging for medical devices and orthopedic implants. A surgeon performing minimally invasive procedures might rely on UFP's single-use components designed specifically for their surgical instruments, while a medical device manufacturer might partner with UFP to create specialized packaging that maintains product sterility.\nBeyond healthcare, UFP Technologies leverages its materials expertise in automotive, aerospace, defense, and industrial markets. In automotive applications, the company produces components that reduce vehicle weight for better fuel efficiency and improve acoustic insulation. For defense clients, UFP creates protective gear components and custom cases for transporting sensitive equipment.\nUFP generates revenue through direct sales of its custom-engineered solutions to original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers. The company maintains FDA-registered facilities with ISO 13485 certification for medical device manufacturing, allowing it to meet the stringent quality requirements of healthcare clients.\nThe company's engineering teams collaborate with customers from concept through production, using specialized knowledge of materials and manufacturing processes to solve complex design challenges. UFP operates multiple manufacturing locations across the United States, giving it proximity to major customers and the ability to scale production as needed.\n4. Drug Development Inputs & Services\nCompanies specializing in drug development inputs and services play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology value chain. Essential support for drug discovery, preclinical testing, and manufacturing means stable demand, as pharmaceutical companies often outsource non-core functions with medium to long-term contracts. However, the business model faces high capital requirements, customer concentration, and vulnerability to shifts in biopharma R&D budgets or regulatory frameworks. Looking ahead, the industry will likely enjoy tailwinds such as increasing investment in biologics, cell and gene therapies, and advancements in precision medicine, which drive demand for sophisticated tools and services. There is a growing trend of outsourcing in drug development for nimbleness and cost efficiency, which benefits the industry. On the flip side, potential headwinds include pricing pressures as efforts to contain healthcare costs are always top of mind. An evolving regulatory backdrop could also slow innovation or client activity.\nUFP Technologies competes with diversified medical component manufacturers like Integer Holdings (NYSE:ITGR), Nordson Medical (part of Nordson Corporation, NASDAQ:NDSN), and privately-held companies such as Viant Medical and Medbio in the medical device solutions space.\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $588.6 million in revenue over the past 12 months, UFP Technologies is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, UFP Technologies\u2019s 25.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was excellent. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. UFP Technologies\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 23.5% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nThis quarter, UFP Technologies\u2019s year-on-year revenue growth of 37.2% was wonderful, and its $151.2 million of revenue was in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.5% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above average for the sector and indicates the market is baking in some success for its newer products and services.\n7. Operating Margin\nUFP Technologies has done a decent job managing its cost base over the last five years. The company has produced an average operating margin of 14.5%, higher than the broader healthcare sector.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, UFP Technologies\u2019s operating margin rose by 5.6 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Zooming in on its more recent performance, we can see the company\u2019s trajectory is intact as its margin has also increased by 1.4 percentage points on a two-year basis.\nIn Q2, UFP Technologies generated an operating margin profit margin of 16.1%, down 1.3 percentage points year on year. This reduction is quite minuscule and indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nUFP Technologies\u2019s EPS grew at an astounding 32.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 25.3% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nDiving into the nuances of UFP Technologies\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, UFP Technologies\u2019s operating margin declined this quarter but expanded by 5.6 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its higher earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, UFP Technologies reported adjusted EPS at $2.50, up from $1.86 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects UFP Technologies\u2019s full-year EPS of $9.82 to grow 1.6%.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nUFP Technologies has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 7.3% over the last five years, slightly better than the broader healthcare sector.\nTaking a step back, we can see that UFP Technologies\u2019s margin expanded by 1.3 percentage points during that time. This is encouraging because it gives the company more optionality.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough UFP Technologies hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately, it historically found a few growth initiatives that worked. Its five-year average ROIC was 13.2%, higher than most healthcare businesses.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, UFP Technologies\u2019s ROIC has increased. This is a good sign, and if its returns keep rising, there\u2019s a chance it could evolve into an investable business.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nUFP Technologies reported $14.89 million of cash and $163.6 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $123.7 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view UFP Technologies\u2019s 1.2\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $6.99 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from UFP Technologies\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was encouraging to see UFP Technologies beat analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue was in line. Overall, this print had some key positives. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 2.5% to $220.50 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy UFP Technologies?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:23 AM EDT\nBefore investing in or passing on UFP Technologies, we urge you to understand the company\u2019s business quality (or lack thereof), valuation, and the latest quarterly results - in that order.\nUFP Technologies isn\u2019t a bad business, but we have other favorites. First off, its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years. And while UFP Technologies\u2019s subscale operations give it fewer distribution channels than its larger rivals, its astounding EPS growth over the last five years shows its profits are trickling down to shareholders.\nUFP Technologies\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 21.5x. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're fairly confident there are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $329.50 on the company (compared to the current share price of $218.99)."
