In the games, the lead Kane was voiced by Brian Bloom and the hot-headed Lynch by Jarion Monroe.\nA sequel, Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days, was released in 2010 \u2013 and the series has remained a cult favorite since, even if both titles currently hover around the mid-60s on game aggregator site Metacritic.\nTimo Tjahjanto, who made his name with Indonesian horror May the Devil Take You, is next helming Nobody 2, a holiday-themed caper that sees Bob Odenkirk's ex-assassin Hutch attempt a getaway with his family. The key word: attempt. Things quickly go awry when he stumbles upon a bootlegging operation and a criminal conspiracy.\nFrom there, Hutch deals with the family-endangering situation with his own inimitable (and heavy-handed) approach.\nFor more, be sure to see what's making the jump from consoles to cinemas in our guide to upcoming video game movies.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nI'm the Senior Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, focusing on news, features, and interviews with some of the biggest names in film and TV.

What awaits the Straw Hat Crew there?\"\nOne Piece remake\nRelease date: TBA\nWhere to watch the One Piece remake: Netflix\nOver 1,000 episodes later, One Piece has become one of the most daunting marathons in television history.

The hype surrounding the show had died down a little but an incredible new trailer increased our expectations for the continued adaptation of the Monster Association arc.\nOshi no Ko season 3\nRelease date: 2026\nWhere to watch Oshi No Ko season 3: TBC\nTo spoil Oshi No Ko's premise would do a disservice to what was one of the most mindblowing twists in recent years. Needless to say, we'll keep it brief: the anime focuses on two twins who find themselves embroiled in the world of pop idols, all deliciously wrapped up in a murder mystery. The second season arrived in 2024, but we'll now have to wait until 2026 for a return to the stage.\nPokemon Concierge Part 2\nRelease date: September 4, 2025\nWhere to watch Pokemon Concierge: Netflix\nIt's time to head back to the idyllic, sun-kissed Pokemon Resort as Haru and her colleagues help solve a summer's worth of Poke-problems in a second helping of this adorable stop-motion series.\nPokemon Horizons: The Series Part 2\nRelease date: Out now\nWhere to watch Pokemon Horizons: The Series: Netflix/BBC\nSo long, Ash! The winding road that saw Pallet Town's favorite son finally become a Pokemon Master came to an end last year.

The second part is titled The Search for Laqua and follows Liko and Roy's journey to track down the remaining Hero 'mon as they travel to Laqua. It's out now on Netflix in the US, and there's even a sequel series (Mega Voltage) in the works.\nIf you want to know how the new series fits into the story so far, check out our guide on how to watch Pokemon in order.\nRanma 1/2 season 2\nRelease date: TBC\nWhere to watch Ranma 1/2: Netflix\nThe remake of beloved '90s anime Ranma 1/2 was released on Netflix in 2024. As the synopsis suggested, we went for typically madcap ride from one of the medium's zaniest setups: \"After training, Ranma acquires a mysterious constitution that allows him to turn back into a woman when poured with water, and a man when poured with hot water.\"\nConfusing matters further, Ranma then falls for a young female martial artist called Akane and the two are betrothed. A second season of the unique romcom was announced, but there's no news yet on when it's dropping.\nRe: Zero season 3\nRelease date: February 5, 2025\nWhere to watch Re:Zero season 3: Crunchyroll\nRe:Zero returned for the second part of its third season in February.

      "text": "Live-action Akira movie finally dies after Warner Bros. give up rights to beloved anime\nIt was too difficult for Tetsuo and the studio, apparently.\nTrying to bring what is widely regarded as one of the greatest animes ever made into the real world is no easy task, so much so that after more than 20 years, Warner Bros. has finally given up on their hopes for an Akira movie, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\nThe history of the studio's struggle to get the project off the ground now feels as epic as the source material. Based on the 1982 manga series by Katsuhiro Otomo, Akira was adapted into the now-iconic anime in 1988 and follows Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda as he attempts to rescue his best friend and fellow biker gang member, Tetsuo Shima, who has been captured by the government and experimented on to awaken his psychic abilities. The transformation eventually leads to a battle that tears the futuristic world of Neo Tokyo apart.\nWarner Bros. acquired the rights to adapt the story in 2002. Since then, a handful of directors and writers have either been approached or taken on the project only to abandon what feels like a borderline unfilmable endeavor. Blade director Stephen Norrington was the first to accept the gig, immediately making changes by depicting Kaneda and Tetsuo as brothers. Unfortunately, he didn't get very far and left the project, likely due to the fallout from the box-office failure he helmed before it \u2013 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\nFrom there, writers like Rogue One's Gary Whitta, followed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Black Adam, The Shallows, Carry On), stepped in and out, trying to bring Akira to life. Nevertheless, by 2012, the studio continued to move forward, even forming a cast that included Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Stewart, Ken Watanabe, and Helena Bonham Carter, before plans collapsed once again.\nBy 2017, more potential directors were rumored to be in discussions or approached about taking on what was quickly becoming a cursed project. George Miller, Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele (who pays homage to the anime in Nope with that now-iconic bike skid), David Sandberg, and Daniel Espinosa were all reportedly on the list before Warner Bros. finally made a deal with Taika Waititi.\nThe daring filmmaker made considerable progress with it, even attempting to secure an all-Japanese cast. Sadly, however, development began to slow down again, with Waititi focusing on other projects, including his Oscar-winning Jojo Rabbit. In 2020, the director effectively confirmed it was off the table, saying, \u201cI think eventually it will happen, I\u2019m just not sure if I\u2019ll be doing it.\u201d Now, with the rights out in the wild once more, whatever Waititi had planned, we're certainly never going to see it.\nSo what now? Well, with the rights available for competing studios to get a hold of, someone else could try to take on what Warner Bros. couldn't accomplish in over two decades. We'll be sure to keep an eye out for whether someone dares and, if so, how long before they end up screaming \"Tetsuo!\" to the heavens for a story that might be best staying as is.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nNever mind, though. At least there are plenty more anime to watch. In fact, here's a list of essential viewing from 2025 you should watch right now.\nNick is a freelancer whose work can be found at Screen Rant, The Digital Fix, and Looper.

      "text": "Live-action adaptation of Your Name director's underappreciated anime classic gets a trailer that might break your heart all over again\n5 Centimeters per Second hits Japanese cinemas this October\nA live-action adaptation of Makoto Shinkai's criminally underappreciated movie 5 Centimeters per Second is in the works \u2013 and its new trailer might break your heart all over again.\nCharting the story of the life, lost loves, and missed connections of protagonist Takaki, the 2007 anime movie is an anthology, split into three sections in 1991, 1998, and 2008.\nSadly, the new trailer is all in Japanese but, if you're familiar with Shinkai's work, you'll know the rich imagery, often with a focus on the contrast between tranquil countrysides and urban chaos, will tide you over. Watch it for yourself below.\n5 Centimeters per Second, starring J-Pop idol Hokuto Matsumura, hits Japanese cinemas on October 10, but there's no word yet on a Western release. Given the recent trend of new anime movies coming to these shores months after their debut in Japan, we wouldn't completely rule out watching it in a cinema near you soon, however.\nShinkai's best-known work, Your Name, has also been mooted as a possible future live-action adaptation \u2013 but has since stalled.\nSpeaking to Empire, Twisters director Lee Isaac Chung, who was once attached to the project, ultimately felt there were cultural barriers getting in the way of an adaptation, which was reportedly going to be set in America.\n\u201cI like the animated film, but what I didn't realize is how hard it is to adapt a Japanese animated movie and to try to do that for America. That was the goal that Toho had put before us. But it's really hard to do.\u201d\nFor more, check out our picks for the best anime movies and best Crunchyroll anime you should be watching right now.\nI'm the Senior Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, focusing on news, features, and interviews with some of the biggest names in film and TV.
