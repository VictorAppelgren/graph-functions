  "content": "\u2022 President Trump has frequently vowed not to cut Social Security benefits, while also promising to make the retirement program more productive and cost efficient.\n\u2022 Despite efforts to reduce unnecessary spending, the Social Security Trust Fund that pays retired-worker benefits is still on pace to be depleted by 2033.\n\u2022 President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" created new deductions that mean 88% of seniors on Social Security will not owe taxes on benefits, but it will also accelerate trust fund depletion. President Donald Trump has frequently promised not to cut Social Security benefits. \"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,\" he said during an interview with Fox News earlier this year. The president has also vowed to rid the program of fraud, waste, and abuse and pursued that goal tenaciously. Trump is now 200 days into his second term. While none of the Social Security changes made by his administration have overtly reduced benefits, recent changes to tax law could still have negative consequences for retired workers and other beneficiaries. Read on to learn more. The Social Security Administration is taking action to improve productivity and reduce unnecessary spending The Social Security Administration (SSA) has worked with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to increase productivity, reduce unnecessary spending, and eliminate fraud. The most consequential changes to date are listed below:\n\u2022 Cost savings: The SSA has identified over $1 billion in cost savings through \"common-sense approaches in areas such as payroll, information technology, contract and grants, real property, printing, travel, and purchase card policies.\" That represents about 15% of the estimated administrative expenses in fiscal 2025.\n\u2022 Workforce reductions: In February, the SSA cut its staffing target to 50,000 workers, down from 57,000. The agency has made progress on rightsizing its headcount, processing 350 deferred resignations and 3,000 voluntary separations through April. Those efforts will eventually lead to cost savings, but deferred resignations and voluntary separations involve incentive payments that will increase spending in the near term.\n\u2022 Overpayment recovery: The SSA increased the overpayment recovery rate to 50%, up from 10% under the Biden administration. That means retired workers who are overpaid by the SSA will have half of their benefits withheld until the balance is zero. The first notices were mailed in late April, and garnishments began in late July. The SSA estimates it will save $7 billion over the next decade.\n\u2022 Fraud prevention: In April, the SSA introduced new fraud prevention technology that lets beneficiaries complete all claims by telephone. The agency previously planned to require in-person or online identity proofing. But new anti-fraud capabilities will instead analyze patterns to identify anomalies within accounts, such that in-person identity proofing will only be required when irregularities are detected with phone claims.\n\u2022 Improved customer service: In July, the SSA provided an update regarding the ongoing push to improve customer service. A new telecommunications platform introduced earlier this year has been rolled out to 70% of field offices, reducing the average speed to answer by 50%, compared to the annual average last year. Also, upgrades to my Social Security will ensure the online portal provides uninterrupted, 24/7 access starting in mid-July.\n\nWhile changes detailed above are a step in the right direction, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund -- the financial account that pays benefits to retirees, spouses, and survivors -- is projected to run a $3.7 trillion deficit during the next decade. Changes to Social Security under the Trump administration won't come close to solving that problem. Moreover, the Board of Trustees recently estimated the OASI Trust Fund would be depleted by 2033, at which point benefits would automatically be cut 23% without congressional intervention. But recent changes to tax law could accelerate the time to depletion and deepen the necessary benefit cuts. A new deduction means nearly 90% of seniors on Social Security will not owe taxes on benefits On July 4, President Trump's megabill was signed into law. The legislation didn't directly eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, but it did add a new deduction for seniors aged 65 and older. That deduction is in addition to the existing senior deduction and standard deduction, as detailed below:\n\u2022 Single seniors with up to $75,000 in income can now deduct $23,750 when completing federal tax returns.\n\u2022 Married seniors filing jointly with up to $150,000 in income can now deduct $46,700 when completing federal tax returns. The White House says 88% of seniors on Social Security will not pay taxes on benefit income with the new deductions in place. But the new tax laws come with a downside: Social Security is partially funded by taxes collected on benefits, and some of that revenue will now disappear. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) estimates that President Trump's megabill will cut funding by about $30 billion annually. As mentioned, the OASI Trust Fund was already on pace to be exhausted in 2033. But the CRFB says the \"big, beautiful bill\" will pull the depletion date forward to 2032, leaving Congress with even less time to find a solution for the funding shortfall that could now exceed $4 trillion in the next decade. If lawmakers fail to find a fix before the OASI Trust Fund is exhausted, Social Security benefits will automatically be reduced by 24%, according to the CRFB. That's up from the 23% benefit cut anticipated before President Trump signed the \"big, beautiful bill\" into law. If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. One easy trick could pay you as much as $23,760 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after. Join Stock Advisor to learn more about these strategies.

      "text": "Social Security forms an important part of most people's retirement plans, but the program itself does much more than just that. In a nutshell, Social Security is designed to support disabled and retired workers and their families by providing a guaranteed source of lifetime income for those who meet certain criteria.\nHere's a closer look at how the program works, the different types of Social Security benefits available, and what you can expect when you're ready to claim benefits.\nHow Social Security works\nHow Social Security works\nSocial Security is a government program that collects taxes from working Americans and distributes these funds to qualifying disabled workers, retirees, and their families to help them remain financially secure.\nA worker typically must earn 40 credits to qualify for Social Security, though if they die or are disabled young, they may qualify with fewer credits. A credit is defined as $1,730 of earned income in 2024 and $1,810 of earned income in 2025. You can earn up to four credits per year.\nYou may claim Social Security based on your own work record, if you've earned enough credits, or you may be eligible to claim spousal benefits based on your current or ex-spouse's work record if this amount is larger than what you're entitled to on your own. Dependent children and other family members may also qualify for family benefits in certain circumstances.\nWhen you're ready to apply for Social Security, you must fill out an application online or at your local Social Security Administration office. A government representative will verify the information in your application to determine if you qualify and then you'll begin receiving monthly checks.\nTypes of Social Security benefits\nTypes of Social Security benefits\nThere are three main types of Social Security benefits:\n- Retirement benefits\n- Disability benefits\n- Survivors benefits\nRetirement benefits\nRetirement benefits\nSocial Security retirement benefits are for workers 62 and older who have earned at least 40 credits. The size of your benefit checks depends on your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) over your 35 highest-earning years, and the age at which you begin benefits.\nYou must wait until your full retirement age (FRA) to claim your standard benefit based on your AIME. Your FRA is 66 if you were born between 1943 and 1954. For those born between 1955 and 1959, FRA rose by two months every year thereafter. For anyone born in 1960 or later, full retirement age is 67.\nClaiming benefits before your full retirement age (FRA) reduces your checks.\nIf you begin claiming at 62, you'll get only 70% of your standard benefit if your FRA is 67 or 75% if your FRA is 66. Every month you delay benefits increases your checks slightly until you reach the maximum benefit at 70. This is 124% of your standard benefit if your FRA is 67 or 132% if your FRA is 66.\nReceiving Social Security benefits under your FRA could cause you to lose some of that money back to the government if your income is high enough. The Social Security Earnings Test withholds:\n- $1 from your checks for every $2 you earn above $22,320 per year if you will be under your full retirement age all year in 2024.\n- $1 from your checks for every $2 you earn above $23,400 per year if you will be under your full retirement age all year in 2025.\n- $1 for every $3 you earn over $59,520 if you will reach full retirement age in 2024.\n- $1 for every $3 you earn over $62,160 if you will reach your full retirement age in 2025.\nOnce you're past your FRA, the government recalculates your benefit to include the amount it withheld.\nCertain family members can claim benefits on your work record if doing so would give them more money than they're eligible for on their own work record.\nEligible family members include:\nEligible family members include:\n- Spouses\n- Ex-spouses, if the marriage lasted for at least 10 years and they have not remarried\n- Children under 18, or up to 19 if still enrolled in high school\n- Children of any age who were disabled before 22 and are not earning more than $1,550 per month in 2024 or $1,620 per month in 2025. Social Security defines disability as a medical condition that results in severe functional limitations and that is expected to last 12 months or longer or result in death\nSpouses and ex-spouses must be at least 62 in order to claim benefits, and spouses and children must wait for the worker to begin claiming benefits themselves before they can claim family benefits on their record.\nDisability benefits\nDisability benefits\nSocial Security disability benefits are available to adults 18 or older who are unable to work due to a physical or mental disability that is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death. You may still be eligible even if you haven't earned 40 credits, depending upon your age at the time of your disability. Your benefit is determined by your average lifetime earnings, so individuals who earned more while they were working will receive larger disability checks.\nYou must provide the government with information about your work history and your medical condition, including relevant supporting documents, when you apply. The Social Security Administration will review your case to decide if you are eligible. If it rules in your favor, you'll receive disability checks for as long as your disability lasts or the rest of your life, depending on the condition. If it rules against you, you may request a reconsideration or appeal to an administrative law judge.\nFamily members may be able to claim benefits on a disabled worker\u2019s work record if they are:\n- A spouse 62 or older or of any age if caring for a disabled worker\u2019s disabled child or child 16 or younger\n- Ex-spouses who were married to the disabled worker for at least 10 years and have not remarried if they meet the same criteria as spouses\n- Unmarried children up to 18, or 19 if still attending high school\n- Children of any age who were disabled before 22\nSurvivors benefits\nSurvivors benefits\nSurvivors benefits are benefits for the family members of deceased workers who qualified for Social Security.\nThe amount of the survivors benefit depends on the deceased worker's average income, adjusted for inflation, and their relationship to the deceased.\nSurviving spouses who are 60 or older (50 or older if disabled) may claim survivors benefits, as can surviving spouses of any age if they are caring for the deceased worker's child who is under 16 or disabled. The same rules apply for ex-spouses as long as they were married to the deceased worker for at least 10 years and have not remarried.\nThe deceased worker's children under 18, or up to 19 if still enrolled in high school, are eligible for benefits, as are disabled children of any age if they were disabled before 22. Parents of the deceased worker may also qualify for benefits if the deceased was providing 50% or more of their financial support before they died.\nIn addition to these benefits, the surviving spouse or children may be eligible for a one-time death benefit of $255.\nRelated Retirement Topics\nBrief history of Social Security\nBrief history of Social Security\nThe Social Security program was created by the Social Security Act that President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law in 1935. The first checks went out in 1940. Originally it paid benefits only to workers 65 and older, but in the 1970s the government altered it to allow workers to claim benefits as early as 62. It also instituted annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to help Social Security keep pace with inflation.\nThe program has worked fairly well so far, but many people fear for the future, when there will be fewer workers to support a greater number of Social Security recipients.\nThe latest Social Security Trustees' Report indicates that the program's retirement trust fund could be depleted by 2033, after which it would be able to pay out only about 79% of benefits to retirees. Though previous reports estimated that Social Security's disability trust fund would run dry by 2057, the latest trustee's report projects that the disability trust fund will not be depleted in the next 75 years.\nThe government has proposed several possible solutions for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the program, but at present no plans have been set. There's no risk of the program disappearing in the next decade or two, but it's possible future benefits may not go as far as they do today. That's why today's workers need to prioritize their personal retirement savings, so they can cover most of their expenses on their own."

Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "For most retirees, their Social Security check is more than just income. It's a financial foundation that many would struggle to make do without.\nWhen the Social Security Act was signed into law nearly 90 years ago, its purpose was to provide for aging workers who could no longer do so for themselves. In 2023, the program was responsible for lifting an estimated 22 million people above the federal poverty line, 16.3 million of which were adults aged 65 and over, according to an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In other words, Social Security is doing exactly what it was intended to do.\nThere's pretty much nothing of greater importance for beneficiaries than knowing how much they'll take home each month from America's leading retirement program.\nBut beginning later this month, a Social Security policy adjustment instituted under President Donald Trump can vastly change the monthly payout for more than 1,000,000 beneficiaries.\nDonald Trump's first five months in office have been marked by multiple Social Security changes\nSince President Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, there have been numerous changes to Social Security:\n- Trump signed an executive order that'll eliminate the use of paper checks by Sept. 30, 2025.\n- Personal identification methods were improved to reduce fraudulent activity. For instance, updating direct deposit information will need to be done in-person or online via a \"my Social Security\" account with two-factor authentication.\n- Former Fiserv CEO Frank Bisignano was confirmed as the new head of the Social Security Administration (SSA).\n- Based on suggestions by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was created by the executive order of President Trump, the SSA is cutting 7,000 jobs and shuttering some of its offices to lower its administrative expenses.\nBut arguably the two biggest adjustments have to do with garnishments of Social Security payouts to select beneficiaries.\nFor instance, by \"sometime this summer,\" according to a Trump administration official, a 15% garnishment is set to be reinstated on an estimated 452,000 retired-worker beneficiaries who are delinquent on their federal student loans.\nThe other eye-popping change was the reinstatement of higher clawbacks on Social Security overpayments. In March, the SSA announced plans to reinstate a 100% clawback rate in instances where beneficiaries were overpaid, which would have been a sizable increase from the 10% clawback rate instituted during Joe Biden's presidency.\nHowever, backlash over the 100% garnishment rate coerced the SSA to lower its recovery rate to 50% of monthly benefits in an April announcement.\nDonald Trump's administration is targeting Social Security overpayments\nBased on data from KFF and Cox Media group, nearly 2 million beneficiaries closed out fiscal year 2023 (the federal government's fiscal year ends on Sept. 30) owing money to the SSA via overpayment.\nFurthermore, the SSA's Office of the Inspector General reported a whopping $23 billion in uncollected overpayments at the end of September 2023. Collecting these overpayments fits with the Trump administration's theme of making federal programs more efficient and cutting down on perceived fraud.\nYou might be wondering how these overpayments occur in the first place. Sometimes it's entirely the fault of the SSA due to various miscalculations, which results in beneficiaries receiving more than they're entitled.\nOther times it's the result of the recipient themselves not updating their information. For instance, non-blind disabled workers have the ability to earn up to $1,620 per month in wages and salary in 2025 without having their Social Security disability benefit halted. But if a disabled worker begins earning more than $1,620 per month and fails to update their income with the SSA, it can result in an overpayment (i.e., funds they shouldn't have received due to their income being above the threshold).\nThough it's been known since April 25 that the SSA, under the Trump administration, would more aggressively seek clawbacks of overpayments, there hadn't been a definitive timeline on when these garnishments would begin... until now.\nNew communication from the SSA states:\nWhen we determine an individual receiving Title II benefits is overpaid, we send them a notice requesting a full and immediate refund and inform them of their right to request reconsideration or a waiver of recovery. We usually provide 90 days for the individual to request a lower rate of withholding, a reconsideration, or waiver.\nWith an effective date of April 25 on the SSA's communication, it means the 90-day grace period is up as of July 24. The north of 1,000,000 beneficiaries who still owe the SSA following an overpayment can have up to half of their monthly check garnished starting on or shortly after July 24 until the overpayment is settled.\nThere are multiple ways to legally avoid or reduce a Social Security garnishment due to overpayment\nBased on the latest national survey of retirees by Gallup, a combined 86% rely on Social Security as a \"major\" or \"minor\" income source. Though clawbacks apply to all forms of beneficiaries (retirees, survivors of deceased workers, and workers with disabilities), garnishing up to 50% of monthly benefits could spell financial trouble for those who've been overpaid.\nThe silver lining, if there is one to be found among beefed-up clawback rates, is that the SSA offers beneficiaries three ways to completely remove or potentially reduce how much they have to pay back -- and they're all completely legal.\nThe ideal outcome for beneficiaries who've received too much from Social Security would be an overpayment waiver. Form SSA-632BK (\"Request for Waiver of Overpayment Recovery\") is a request to forgive the overpayment. If the overpayment wasn't your fault (this part tends to be important) and it would create a financial hardship to repay the added benefits you received, the SSA may approve your request and waive any liability. Just keep in mind you'll likely need to supply documentation demonstrating that repayment would, indeed, create a financial hardship.\nOverpaid beneficiaries can file Form SSA-561 (\"Request for Reconsideration\"), as well. This approach can work two different ways. For some, it's a way to appeal the claim they've been overpaid. You'll need to present evidence to the SSA that you haven't been overpaid, and if you reconsideration is successful, the SSA will waive any liability.\nSSA-561 can also be used by individuals who admit they've been overpaid, but disagree with the amount they'll need to pay back. If the SSA agrees, the amount you'll owe can be reduced.\nThe third legal option available to beneficiaries is to file Form SSA-634 (\"Request for Change in Overpayment Recovery Rate\"). This is the preferred option for individuals who admit they've been overpaid, but who believe a 50% garnishment rate would create a financial hardship.\nSimilar to the first option (SSA-632BK), it would require you to provide documentation of your income and qualified expenses to demonstrate your financial hardship. The SSA will aim to work with you on a reduced garnishment rate that settles your overpayment within 12 months, but the agency has been known to extend payment plans out to 60 months.\nWith less than three weeks left before garnishments can begin, don't miss your opportunity to legally avoid or reduce what you'll owe if you're one of the more than 1,000,000 recipients who were overpaid."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump has promised not to cut Social Security benefits, yet recent tax law changes may accelerate the depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund, projected to be exhausted by 2033. The Social Security Administration has implemented measures to improve efficiency and recover overpayments, increasing the recovery rate to 50%. While 88% of seniors may not owe taxes on their benefits due to new deductions, this could lead to a funding shortfall of approximately $30 billion annually, potentially resulting in deeper benefit cuts for retirees.",
