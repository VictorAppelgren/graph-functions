  "title": "Squirrels won't go near bird feeders if you put 1 unusual item in your garden",
  "description": "One ingenious solution will deter squirrels from stealing bird food, according to a former royal gardener.",
  "content": "Keep bird feeders just for birds can be a real challenge. Squirrels are notoriously successful at stealing bird food, jumping and climbing their way to access feeders. The relentless creatures they are, squirrels are a real menace to bird feeders, leaving little food \u2013 if any \u2013 for the animals for which they're intended. Even if the animals manage to reach your feeder, a gardening expert has shared an ingenious deterrent that will ward them off. While you may have heard coffee grounds recommended for the task, former royal gardener Jack Stooks has shared 'breading ground for disease' \u2013 and one children's toy works better.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Coffee Friend, the former royal gardener said: \"Coffee grounds can be sprinkled around the base of bird feeders. The idea is that the smell might deter squirrels. People say that this method can help.\" However, Jack noted can become a hazard to birds: \"If you put instant coffee on a bird feeder, the moment it rains, it\u2019s going to turn into a sticky, mucky mess. \"Birds will walk through it, and that mess can then turn into a breeding ground for disease, which could spread among the bird population. So it\u2019s not just ineffective - it\u2019s potentially harmful as sludgy grounds could lead to the spread of disease.\" Instead, Jack has put forth an unusual suggestion he says is more effective anyway \u2014 a Slinky.\n\n\"If you are looking to deter squirrels from the garden, you should use something more practical, like a child's Slinky,\" he advised. \"You can simply thread it down the pole of your bird feeder, and when a squirrel tries to climb it, they simply can\u2019t. It's a much cleaner and safer solution than spreading coffee grounds everywhere, just in case they get wet.\" From deterring animals to fertilising soil, coffee grounds has many uses around the garden. Generally speaking, the kitchen scrap is beneficial to soil, but it can damage certain plants as it's acidic. He warned: \"Specifically, you want to use it around ericaceous plants - things like rhododendrons, azaleas, and hydrangeas. These types of plants prefer acidic soil, so they\u2019ll tolerate the coffee grounds well.\n\n\"But for the rest of the plants in your garden? Not ideal. You don\u2019t really want to go overboard using coffee grounds on plants that don\u2019t like acidic conditions. Coffee grounds is safe for soil in moderation, according to the gardener, but the safest way to reuse them is with your compost. \"Most garden soil can handle small amounts just fine, but if you're applying large quantities, definitely stick to acid-loving plants. Otherwise, you\u2019re better off disposing of the grounds in the compost. \"In short, if you are unsure about the plant, the safest way to use it in the garden is in compost. It\u2019s reliable, it helps the composting process, and you don\u2019t have to worry about it affecting plant health in unintended ways.\"",
