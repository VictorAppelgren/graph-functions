  "content": "Shares of fintech mortgage provider Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) jumped 6.8% in the afternoon session after a favorable U.S. inflation report bolstered expectations for an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, a positive development for the mortgage industry. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July was largely in line with market expectations, a development that increased the chances of a Federal Reserve rate cut at its September meeting to 95%. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for the housing sector as they typically translate into lower mortgage rates. This makes homeownership more accessible and stimulates demand, directly benefiting mortgage lenders like Rocket. The positive sentiment was widespread across the market, lifting major U.S. stock indexes.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $18.27, up 6.8% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Rocket Companies? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nRocket Companies\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 36 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% on the news that markets rebounded following a sharp sell-off in the previous trading session as investor optimism grew around a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut following a weak U.S. jobs report. The softer-than-expected employment data for July fueled bets that the Fed could lower rates as soon as September to support the economy. This sentiment was reflected in the bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield fell to a three-month low. Adding to the positive momentum, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) indicated it may support raising regulatory thresholds for banks, a move that could reduce compliance costs and further boost profitability for financial institutions.\n\nRocket Companies is up 68.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $18.28 per share, it is still trading 12.2% below its 52-week high of $20.81 from August 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Rocket Companies\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $914.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.",

      "text": "Rocket Companies (RKT)\nRocket Companies is interesting. Its sales and EPS are anticipated to grow nicely over the next 12 months, a welcome sign for investors.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Rocket Companies Is Interesting\nBorn in Detroit during the 1980s and evolving into a tech-driven financial powerhouse, Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) is a fintech company that provides digital mortgage lending, real estate services, and personal finance solutions through its technology platform.\n- Notable projected net interest income growth of 47.8% for the next 12 months hints at market share gains\n- Industry-leading 34.1% return on equity demonstrates management\u2019s skill in finding high-return investments\n- On the other hand, its products and services are facing significant end-market challenges during this cycle as sales have declined by 12.3% annually over the last five years\nWhy Should You Watch Rocket Companies\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy Should You Watch Rocket Companies\nRocket Companies is trading at $17.05 per share, or 3.2x forward P/B. The lofty valuation multiple means there\u2019s plenty of good news priced into shares; short-term volatility could result if anything (e.g. a mediocre quarter) rains on that parade.\nRocket Companies can improve its fundamentals over time by putting up good numbers quarter after quarter, year after year. Once that happens, we\u2019ll be happy to recommend the stock.\n3. Rocket Companies (RKT) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nFintech mortgage provider Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 4.6% year on year to $1.36 billion. On top of that, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance ($1.68 billion at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 6.9% above what analysts were expecting. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.04 per share was $0.01 above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nRocket Companies (RKT) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Net Interest Income: $32.62 million vs analyst estimates of $33.37 million (2.2% miss)\n- Revenue: $1.36 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.29 billion (4.6% year-on-year growth, 5.8% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.04 vs analyst estimates of $0.03 ($0.01 beat)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $1.68 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.57 billion\n- Market Capitalization: $30.84 billion\nCompany Overview\nBorn in Detroit during the 1980s and evolving into a tech-driven financial powerhouse, Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) is a fintech company that provides digital mortgage lending, real estate services, and personal finance solutions through its technology platform.\nThe company operates through several interconnected businesses centered around homeownership and financial services. Its flagship business, Rocket Mortgage, offers a digital mortgage application and approval process that allows clients to apply, upload documents, e-sign, and manage their loans through a mobile app or website. Rocket Mortgage functions both as a loan originator and servicer, maintaining relationships with clients throughout the life of their loans.\nRocket's ecosystem extends beyond mortgages to include Rocket Homes, a real estate search platform with agent referral services; Rocket Money, a personal finance app for budget management and subscription tracking; Rocket Loans, which provides personal loans; and Amrock, which handles title insurance, property valuation, and settlement services. This integrated approach allows clients to navigate the entire homebuying process within the Rocket platform.\nThe company generates revenue primarily by originating mortgage loans that it sells to government-backed entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or other investors in the secondary mortgage market. Rocket operates through both direct-to-consumer channels and partner networks, including relationships with mortgage brokers and financial institutions.\nRocket has heavily invested in artificial intelligence and data analytics, leveraging its vast data assets (10 petabytes) to automate processes and enhance client experiences. For instance, a homebuyer might use Rocket Homes to find a property, connect with a real estate agent, secure mortgage pre-approval through Rocket Mortgage, and close the transaction with Amrock's services\u2014all within the same technology ecosystem.\n4. Thrifts & Mortgage Finance\nThrifts & Mortgage Finance institutions operate by accepting deposits and extending loans primarily for residential mortgages, earning revenue through interest rate spreads (difference between lending rates and borrowing costs) and origination fees. The industry benefits from demographic tailwinds as millennials enter prime homebuying age, technological advancements streamlining the loan approval process, and potential interest rate stabilization improving affordability. However, significant headwinds include net interest margin compression during rate volatility, increased competition from fintech disruptors offering digital-first experiences, mounting regulatory compliance costs, and potential housing market corrections that could impact loan portfolios and default rates.\nRocket Companies competes with traditional mortgage lenders like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), as well as digital-first mortgage providers such as UWM Holdings (NYSE:UWMC), loanDepot (NYSE:LDI), and PennyMac Financial Services (NYSE:PFSI).\n5. Sales Growth\nNet interest income and and fee-based revenue are the two pillars supporting bank earnings. The former captures profit from the gap between lending rates and deposit costs, while the latter encompasses charges for banking services, credit products, wealth management, and trading activities.\nOver the last five years, Rocket Companies\u2019s demand was weak and its revenue declined by 13.4% per year. This wasn\u2019t a great result, but there are still things to like about Rocket Companies.\nNote: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business.Long-term growth is the most important, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes and market returns. Rocket Companies\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 14.4% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand recently accelerated. Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business.\nThis quarter, Rocket Companies reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 4.6% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 5.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 159% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\n6. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nRocket Companies\u2019s full-year EPS dropped significantly over the last four years. We\u2019ll keep a close eye on the company as diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\nFor Rocket Companies, its two-year annual EPS growth of 66.4% was higher than its four-year trend. This acceleration made it one of the faster-growing bank companies in recent history.\nIn Q2, Rocket Companies reported adjusted EPS at $0.04, down from $0.06 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Rocket Companies\u2019s full-year EPS of $0.20 to grow 170%.\n7. Return on Equity\nReturn on equity (ROE) reveals the profit generated per dollar of shareholder equity, which represents a key source of bank funding. Banks maintaining elevated ROE levels tend to accelerate wealth creation for shareholders via earnings retention, buybacks, and distributions.\nOver the last five years, Rocket Companies has averaged an ROE of 35.8%, exceptional for a company operating in a sector where the average shakes out around 7.5% and those putting up 15%+ are greatly admired. This is a bright spot for Rocket Companies.\n8. Key Takeaways from Rocket Companies\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Rocket Companies blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its net interest income missed. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 5.8% to $15.62 immediately after reporting.\n9. Is Now The Time To Buy Rocket Companies?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:33 AM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Rocket Companies or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nRocket Companies is a fine business. Although its revenue has declined over the last five years, its growth over the next 12 months is expected to be higher. And while Rocket Companies\u2019s TBVPS has declined over the last five years, its estimated net interest income growth for the next 12 months is great. On top of that, its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve.\nRocket Companies\u2019s P/B ratio based on the next 12 months is 3.2x. This valuation tells us that a lot of optimism is priced in. This is a good one to add to your watchlist - there are better opportunities elsewhere at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $16.20 on the company (compared to the current share price of $17.05)."
