  "description": "Official figures released on Thursday showed that UK state borrowing slowed to \u00a31.1 billion in July, providing some relief for the Chancellor.",
  "content": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will still need to raise taxes in the autumn budget despite lower-than-expected Government borrowing last month, economists have warned.\n\nOfficial figures released on Thursday showed that UK state borrowing slowed to \u00a31.1 billion in July, providing some relief for the Chancellor.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said the figure, which was \u00a32.3 billion less than the same month a year earlier, is the lowest July borrowing figure for three years.\n\nIt came after a rise in self-assessed income tax and national insurance payments helped increase tax receipts for the month.\n\nJuly borrowing was lower than the \u00a32 billion figure predicted by a consensus of economists.\n\nBorrowing for the first four months of the financial year stood at \u00a360 billion, \u00a36.7 billion more than during the same period last year.\n\nThe figures come amid warnings the Chancellor may need to raise taxes again in the budget in order to plug a black hole of up to \u00a351 billion in the public finances.\n\nIt has been reported that the Government is looking at hitting owners of high-value houses with capital gains tax (CGT) when they sell their family home.\n\nThe Guardian also reported that the Government is considering an overhaul of the current system on stamp duty on property purchases.\n\nNevertheless, the Labour Government has ruled out increasing income tax, employees\u2019 national insurance contributions and VAT, restricting Ms Reeves\u2019 options when it comes to raising money.\n\nOn Thursday, economists said that the latest data was positive for the Chancellor but does not halt the need for potential tax increases or spending cuts.\n\nElliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe Chancellor will still have to raise taxes in October despite borrowing matching official forecasts.\n\n\u201cThe big picture remains that the public finances are in chronically weak condition.\n\n\u201cWe think the Chancellor will need to resort to sin and stealth tax hikes, duty increases, and a pensions tax raid in order to meet her fiscal rules if she wants to meet her pledge of keeping headline tax rates unchanged.\u201d\n\nMatt Swannell, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cUltimately, it will be the OBR\u2019s (Office for Budget Responsibility) projection for borrowing over the coming years, not solely this year, that will determine whether the Government meets its fiscal target, and doing so will very likely require tax rises at the autumn budget.\n\n\u201cThe little fiscal headroom left at the spring statement has likely been more than used up by rising bond yields, market expectations for the bank rate, and reversals in plans to cut spending in some areas, such as welfare reform.\u201d\n\nThe figures showed that central government receipts \u2013 the amount of money brought in, typically through taxes \u2013 was \u00a3100.1 billion for the month, up \u00a38.8 billion against the same month last year.\n\nThis came as compulsory social contributions, which include national insurance payments, increased by \u00a32.6 billion to \u00a316.3 billion after recent changes to national insurance contributions (Nics) paid by employers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Government also saw a \u00a32.7 billion rise in self-assessed income tax receipts to \u00a315.5 billion.\n\nThe ONS also reported that state spending rose by \u00a35.3 billion to \u00a392.1 billion in July, partly linked to increases to pay and benefits, as well as cost inflation within departments.\n\nONS deputy director for public sector finances Rob Doody said: \u201cBorrowing this July was \u00a32.3 billion down on the same month last year and was the lowest July figure for three years.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the first four months of the financial year as a whole, borrowing was over \u00a36 billion higher than in the same period in 2024.\u201d\n\nChief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: \u201cWe\u2019re investing in our public services and modernising the state, to improve outcomes and reduce costs in the medium term.\n\n\u201cFar too much taxpayer money is spent on interest payments for the longstanding national debt.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re driving down government borrowing over the course of the parliament \u2013 so working people don\u2019t have to foot the bill and we can invest in better schools, hospitals and services for working families.\u201d",

  "summary": "UK state borrowing slowed to \u00a31.1 billion in July, the lowest July borrowing figure for three years, according to the Office for National Statistics. This comes amid warnings that Chancellor Rachel Reeves may need to raise taxes in the budget to offset a deficit of up to \u00a351 billion in the public finances. The Government is reportedly considering hitting owners of high-value houses with capital gains tax (CGT) when they sell their family home, and considering overhauling the current system on stamp duty on property purchases. However, the Labour Government has ruled out increasing income tax, employees\u2019 national insurance contributions and VAT, limiting Reeves' options when it comes to raising money. Despite this, economists believe that the data does not eliminate the need for potential tax increases or spending cuts.",

The Labour government has ruled out hikes to income tax, national insurance and VAT, leaving it to consider measures such as capital gains tax on high\u2011value homes and a stamp duty overhaul.
