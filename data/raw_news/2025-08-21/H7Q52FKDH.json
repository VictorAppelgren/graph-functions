  "content": "Okay, for market movers, we're going to focus on the big big box retailers now that we've heard from the three biggest this week, Walmart, Home Depot, and Target. Well, let's recap what we heard from Walmart, the world's largest retailer just a few moments ago and see how its shares are doing in the pre-market. As you can see, shares are down around 1% in the pre-market. Now, as I said earlier, revenues beat on expectations, but earnings per share missed at 68 cents. The market was expecting 74 cents. The share price though ticking closer to the flat line there, though. Now, Walmart, it actually raised its full-year sales guidance, and it has an optic and gave sort of an optimistic signal about what they thought how the consumers feeling about purchasing, and that's despite rising concerns over inflation and possibly some some weaker economic data that we've seen recently as well. In fact, over the year, shares are up over 13% for Walmart. The S&P as a whole is just up 9%. But since Liberation Day back in April, the stock is up over 25%, as you can see there. Now, the retailer has paid a lot of attention to its low price strategy in order to offset any uncertainty that's come about as a result of tariffs, and also as households have become more cautious when it comes to their budgets. Okay, let's move on to Home Depot. Now, earlier in the week, it kept its annual forecast intact, despite posting muted quarterly results on Tuesday. Both revenue and earnings per share just missed the mark. On Results Day, its shares actually gained 3%, as you can see there, but have paired back some of those gains since. But the retailer did say that some products may see small price hikes due to tariffs after previously suggesting they would generally not change. The top US home improvement chain is betting that customers will continue to spend on smaller scale maintenance projects, and that demand from professional contractors will stay strong in the second half of the year. Less clear is when the stalled US housing market and major home renovations that require financing will start to pick up. Now, Home Depot, which sources more than 50% of its products from the US, said there would be modest price hikes in some imported goods that currently face higher tariff rates than what it had anticipated back in May, when the company said it would generally maintain pricing, but that some items could disappear from shelves. Finally, let's move on to Target, and the story here wasn't really about their poor results, but the change at the top. Its shares fell over 6% yesterday after the company also named Michael Fidelki as its next CEO. Now, Fidelki was the retailer's CFO. So no chain, he's an internal higher. Okay, the results weren't as shockingly bad as the first quarter, but the retailer is still struggling to find its place in the new economic norm of more discerning shoppers. Now, Target's second quarter earnings narrowly topped consensus forecasts as it wrung out cost savings. The company also maintained the full its full-year outlook it slashed three months ago. But headwinds from a pressured US consumer and influx of tariffs from the Trump administration, market share loss to rival Walmart and operational challenges are clearly quite apparent. Okay, coming up, all eyes on Jackson Hole, and what investors need to know about the Federal Reserve's annual gathering. That's next on Morning Brief Market Sunrise.\n\nWelcome back to Morning Brief Market Sunrise. Now, the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole Economic Symposium officially kicks off today with Fed Chair Jerome Powell expected to speak tomorrow. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickre breaks down everything investors need to know about the conference in today's Stocks in Translation.\n\nIt's late August in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where a media frenzy converges around top finance and economic officials. A fly fishing invitation in the early 1980s turned into the world's most watched macro meetup. What Fed Chair Jay Powell says here can set the tone for US economic policy into year end. That's right. We're talking about the Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium on today's Stocks in Translation. First, what is it? It's the Kansas City Fed's invitation-only economic policy get-together. Each August, central bankers, academics, financial ministers, and select investors gather to debate economic policy. There's no formal vote, just signals. The symposium got its start in 1978 as a regional Fed gathering. By 1982, the Kansas City Fed, they moved it to Wyoming and Jackson Hole to lure the chair of the Fed, Paul Volcker, an avid fly fisherman, and he showed up. The rest is market folklore. And after the global financial crisis, these August remarks became a thing that investors watch and sometimes trade. So, let's highlight now what Jackson Hole is and what it is not. It's a policy symposium, a gathering to discuss big economic trends and ideas, its speeches, papers, and debates, but don't call it a Fed meeting. There are only eight official FOMC meetings each year, and Jackson Hole is not one of them. There's no formal action, no vote, no interest rate decision, and no economic projections. But the Jackson Hole symposium isn't just Fed officials, central bankers, finance ministers, and top economists. They're comparing notes, stress testing ideas, and sometimes they tip the next chapter of policy. The guest list is very small, but the echo is global. The conversation here sets the tone for the months ahead, and after the summer ends and everyone gets back to business, well, that's when the policymaking starts. Taking stock of some of the more notable years, we had to begin with that 1982 meeting that snagged the interest of Fed Chair Paul Volcker. That set an important precedent, but the meeting would not be closely watched by investors for decades. You're going to notice the next year on the list is 2010. With the global financial crisis still fresh in everyone's minds, Chair Ben Bernanke teased options for so-called QE2, lighting up the possibilities for a huge new round of monetary stimulus. Stocks rallied, and investors paid attention. And just a few years later, Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank in 2014, flagged weak inflation expectations. This set up a big central bank pivot in Europe once again, providing important market signals. Fast forward again to the pandemic year of 2020, and Chair Powell outlined a brand new policy, target inflation. It had been in the works for years, and it was an important shift in Fed policy. Now, here's what investors are going to be listening for this year. The Fed has two mandates from Congress to consider: maximum employment, meaning a solid job market, and stable prices, which means the Fed needs to pay close attention to inflation. So, if Powell sounds optimistic about employment, that it's tight or that wages are still growing at a firm pace, well, then that signals he's less inclined to cut rates to stimulate. That's what's called hawkish. And on the other hand, if Powell talks about the job market cooling, or that wage growth is losing a bit of steam, that suggests that more rate cuts are on the horizon, which is called dovish. And when it comes to inflation, any words like sticky or stalled progress signal hawkishness, and talk of a broader cooling of prices or any disinflation, that's dovish. This might be an oversimplification, but you get the picture. Bottom line, it's a small room that can provide big signals, and what officials say there can set and reset fall policy expectations across rates, stocks, and the dollar. Not every year is seismic, but the chance of a giant reveal keeps investors tuned in, and the media coverage adds to the frenzy.

That's next on Morning Brief Market Sunrise.\n\nWelcome back to Market Sunrise, and now it's time for today's trending tickers. We're watching Johnson & Johnson, WH Smith, and Disney. First up, Johnson & Johnson. It's announced plans to expand its manufacturing in the US. The drug maker is building a new facility in North Carolina as part of a $2 billion commitment to Fuji Film's new biopharmaceutical site over the next 10 years. The project is expected to create more than 100 new jobs in the state. The company says it will share plans for additional manufacturing facilities in the US in the coming months. Now, this comes as the pharmaceutical industry braces for potential drug import duties. Now, next up is British retailer WH Smith, and it's seen its shares nosedive this morning after an apparent accounting error saw a major overstatement in its profits in North America. The share price has dropped over 40% in the pre-market, and at the time markets, and it's, sorry, in the market at the moment, and it has led to slash its full-year profit forecast drastically from 55 million pounds to just 25 million pounds. The UK headquartered group has around 1,300 stores worldwide, including the travel, uh, travel stores in America in motion, and, and it's mainly, they're based in train stations, hospitals, and airports under various other brand names. Now, WH Smith has said in a statement that the error has been blamed on an accelerated recognition of supplier income. Okay, finally, Disney's new ESPN streaming service officially launches today. It lets subscribers access the full range of ESPN's programming outside of a cable bundle. This is the biggest shift in Disney's transition away from legacy networks to digital distribution. The service costs about $30 per month, and it will stream more than 47,000 live events each year. Well, that does it for trending tickers. You can track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance's Trending Tickers page. Okay, the Trump administration is considering taking a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for some of its Chips Act funding, and that could be just the beginning. Officials are reportedly eyeing stakes in other chip makers that have received funds, including Micron, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Samsung. That's according to reports from Reuters.",
