Cleveland made the pick even after trading down in the first round to select defensive tackle Mason Graham and already selecting Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel in the third round.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\"Tonight, Shedeur Sanders made the entire National Football League look like a whole bunch of petty fools and, in some cases, racist fools. In many cases, Deion (Sanders)-despising fools,\" Bayless said in a video. \"Tonight at Carolina, Shedeur Sanders made all those teams that had 143 chances to draft him before he went 144, he shamed all of them, including the Cleveland Browns, who finally took him in the fifth round.\"Bayless didn\u2019t elaborate on how Sanders\u2019 performance made the league look like \"racist fools.\" But he was adamant that he was behind the quarterback all along.BROWNS COACH ADDS TO QUARTERBACK INTRIGUE FOLLOWING SHEDEUR SANDERS' GREAT PRESEASON DEBUTSanders\u2019 free fall to the fifth round of the draft back in the spring, which sparked a massive debate during and after the event.\"It was the biggest disgrace in the history of the National Football League that somehow the sheep-think NFL wanted to teach Shedeur, and in turn Deion, a lesson for how he interviewed, how he carried himself, how he was the highest-paid NIL college player ever,\" Bayless continued.Sanders making the roster still isn\u2019t set in stone as there are four quarterbacks vying for a roster spot with Deshaun Watson on the injured reserve.But his performance against the Carolina Panthers got him off to a good start. He had two touchdown passes and 138 passing yards in the win.Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

He was asked whether he would make a decision on a Week 1 starter following the team\u2019s second preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles later this week.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\"I\u2019m not there yet,\" he told reporters, via ESPN.\nHe also declined to say whether Sanders would get the start against the Eagles.\n\"I'm not there on the game itself. By Wednesday, Thursday, I'll have a better feel for the game and how we're going to handle that and I'll update you guys, but not there yet,\" he added.\nFellow rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel returned to team drills as he looks to make a case for the active roster for the start of the season, according to Cleveland.com. Kenny Pickett was still limited as he recovers from a hamstring issue.\nGIANTS' JAXSON DART GOES VIRAL AS NEW JERSEY TOLL OPTIONS LEAVE ROOKIE CONFUSED\nPalace intrigue around the Browns\u2019 quarterback situation sparked up on Friday night as Sanders had 138 passing yards on 14 completions. He added two touchdown passes as well. Tyler Huntley also threw a touchdown pass. Cleveland defeated the Carolina Panthers, 30-10.\nVeteran Joe Flacco appears to have the inside track to the starting job, given his resume and his familiarity with Stefanski\u2019s offense. But Sanders, who has a lot of hype around him, definitely turned heads with his debut.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Browns are rostering five active quarterbacks in training camp. Deshaun Watson is the sixth but remains on the injured reserve due to a torn Achilles.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

      "text": "The Cleveland Browns surprised everyone when they drafted Oregon\u2019s Dillon Gabriel with their third-round pick, while Shedeur Sanders continued to fall down the NFL Draft board.\nPerhaps an even bigger surprise was when Sanders was taken by the franchise two rounds later, creating a packed quarterbacks room with Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett also vying for the starting job.\nWith Sanders garnering the national spotlight, Gabriel has been in his new teammate's shadow in terms of coverage.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nBut the Heisman Trophy finalist gave the perfect answer to Cleveland-area reporters at rookie minicamp when asked how it feels to have Sanders as a teammate.\n\"I love it,\" Gabriel replied on Saturday. \"You know, I love it because of who it is. I think just for us both, you can learn from one another. But also, it\u2019s not just us two in the room. At least for now [during rookie minicamp] it is, but, you know, going into the year, Kenny, Joe and even Deshaun [Watson], just a bunch of guys who played a bunch of ball that we can all learn from one another.\"\nSHEDEUR SANDERS \u2018TRULY THANKFUL\u2019 FOR DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORT DURING HISTORIC NFL DRAFT SLIDE\nWatson doesn\u2019t figure to be in the running to play at all this season after reinjuring his Achilles during rehab last season.\nGabriel was asked about NFL fans who are already comparing his reps at rookie minicamp to Sanders\u2019, and another proper team-first answer was the result.\n\"I think the more questions I get asked like that, it just divides the team,\" he said. \"For me, we\u2019re in a room full of not just us \u2013 Kenny, Joe and Deshaun. For us, we know how important a healthy QB room is. But also, a team that you want to be a part of.\n\"How do you create an environment every single day where everybody can be their best? That\u2019s just pushing one another, which talent naturally does. Naturally, it\u2019s healthy. For us, we all go do our thing and everyone wins.\"\nJust as Sanders acknowledged the quarterback competition that\u2019s surely to be a top NFL storyline this preseason, Gabriel knows he\u2019s going to have to be at his best if he wishes to get the starting job come Week 1.\n\"I only know one way to prepare,\" Gabriel said. \"I only know one way to work, and that is as the starter. You know, I\u2019ve played a bunch of ball and have a lot of experience, so I\u2019m going to use that to my advantage.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAs of now, it\u2019s likely Flacco\u2019s job to lose heading into training camp, given his history with head coach Kevin Stefanski\u2019s offense. Just two seasons ago, Flacco literally came off the couch and ran Stefanski\u2019s offense into the playoffs, a miraculous feat that won him Comeback Player of the Year. Stefanski was awarded Coach of the Year.\nBut the comparisons and criticism between Gabriel and Sanders only seems natural at this point because of how linked they are after this year\u2019s draft.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."
