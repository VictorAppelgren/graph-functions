      "feedback": "Your draft ambitiously piles a lot of theory, data points, and stock-level color into one document, but it needs a tighter, decision-ready structure to reach world‑class quality. Actionable edits: (1) Fix the regime taxonomy to a clean A/B/C framework (AI productivity with adaptable labor; labor-displacement/demand spillovers; tariff/inflation/pass-through shocks) and either remove Regime D or explicitly define it as an Alt/transition state; ensure every line ties to A/B/C. (2) Consolidate the causal chain into a single, first‑principles flow: p (AI impulse) → potential output vs. demand/sentiment frictions → policy/demand instruments π/T → asset pricing (equities/credit) and risk premia. Anchor every link to the cited evidence (NL5YYTLF2 for automation exposure; YVQU6QCY4 for tariffs; S15934PBQ for pass-through; WTNT85IPR and 22PL3Q360 for Ford/GM; ILYC1M41F for AI healthcare, etc.) and remove or clearly label any non‑anchored assertions. (3) Rebuild the Scenario structure around four crisp lines: exactly 2 Up and 2 Down, with horizons 0–3 months and 3–12 months (or 0–6 and 6–12 if you prefer symmetrical bins), each line containing: Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % (grounded to cited facts). Propose probabilities like Up 0–3m ≈ 65% (NL5YYTLF2); Up 3–12m ≈ 60% (37UZC9X8I ... NL5YYTLF2 ...); Down 0–6m ≈ 30% (NL5YYTLF2); Down 6–12m ≈ 35% (YVQU6QCY4 ... NL5YYTLF2 ... S15934PBQ). (4) For each line, pick a single, tensions-driven driver and a single, rule-based invalidation trigger (e.g., “Regime shift to B” or “tariff surprise”); avoid mixing multiple triggers unless clearly separated. (5) If you intend a Swing Trade, center the Outlook/Trade Plan on a tradable asset (e.g., MSFT) with a tight, actionable 1–2 line plan: Direction Up | Horizon 0–3 months | Entry near breakout | Stop ~5% below breakout | Target ~12% | R/R ~2.4x | Invalidation if Regime B/C shift | Trigger: break above prior highs | Probability ~65% | Confidence ~70%; otherwise, present a concise Outlook line with clear decision signals and explicit invalidation. (6) Compress the macro/narrative into a compact preface that directly maps to the four lines and the plan, trimming extraneous chapters, and ensure every factual claim has an in-text citation to one of the IDs. (7) Tighten the concluding synthesis so it reads as a decision sheet rather than a narrative essay, and ensure all sources are reconciled when they imply different outcomes (e.g., tariff impact vs. UBI effects) by presenting a bounded range rather than conflicting absolutes. (8) Double-check consistency: remove any residual Regime D mentions or clearly define them as alt-paths; ensure all numbers (automation %, tariff costs, vehicle/EV metrics, capex) have explicit source anchors; and ensure the final version is 4 Up/Down lines plus 1–2 Outlook lines, with no trailing citation lists. This will unlock a precise, testable Swing Trade/Outlook output aligned to the required format while preserving the material’s first-principles backbone.",
