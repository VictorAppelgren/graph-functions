  "description": "State Department offers $5 million reward for arrest of Haitian gang leader Jimmy 'Barbecue' Ch\u00e9rizier as he faces federal conspiracy charges.",
  "content": "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro on Tuesday announced an indictment in Washington, D.C., accusing Jimmy \"Barbecue\" Ch\u00e9rizier and Bazile Richardson, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of conspiring to send U.S. funds to finance Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s Haitian gang.The Department of Justice (DOJ) said Ch\u00e9rizier is a fugitive and is believed to be in Haiti.His co-defendant, Richardson, who also goes by \"Fredo,\" \"Fred Lion,\" \"Leo Danger,\" and \"Lepe Blode,\" was arrested in Pasadena, Texas on July 23. Pirro said Tuesday that Ch\u00e9rizier is a gang leader who orchestrated and committed various acts of violence against Haitians.DOJ CONSIDERS SEEKING DEATH PENALTY AGAINST DC SHOOTING SUSPECT CHARGED WITH HATE CRIMEIn 2020, the U.S. sanctioned Ch\u00e9rizier under the Magnitsky Act for his alleged human rights violations. His indictment makes it the first of its kind for an individual sanctioned under the international Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, Pirro added.Richardson and Ch\u00e9rizier grew up together in Haiti, though the former later became a naturalized U.S. citizen and was living in North Carolina.Richardson was indicted for allegedly sending money to Ch\u00e9rizier, knowing that he had been sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act.LEGAL IMMIGRANT'S STATUS REVOKED OVER \u2018CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE, GANG SUPPORT\u2019 IN HAITI: ICE\"I want to let the public know that anyone who was giving money to Ch\u00e9rizier, also known as Barbecue, because of his violent acts in his home country, cannot say \u2018I didn't know. I didn't know that he was sanctioned by the U.S government,\u2019\" Pirro said. \"They will be prosecuted, and we will find them because they are supporting an individual who was committing human rights abuses. And we will not look the other way.\"The State Department\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program announced Tuesday that it is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Ch\u00e9rizier. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is encouraged to contact the State Department.\"There\u2019s a good reason that there\u2019s a $5 million reward for information leading to Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s arrest. He\u2019s a gang leader responsible for heinous human rights abuses, including violence against American citizens in Haiti,\" Pirro said. \"The U.S. government sanctioned Ch\u00e9rizier in 2020 because he was responsible for an ongoing campaign of violence, including the 2018 La Saline massacre, in which 71 people were killed, more than 400 houses were destroyed, and at least seven women raped by armed gangs.\"Court documents show that Ch\u00e9rizier is a former officer in the Haitian National Police and leader of a gang known as the Revolutionary Forces of the G9 Family and Allies, which helped create a gang alliance called Viv Ansanm. The alliance united many of Haiti's criminal gangs in opposition to the legitimate government of Haiti.ALLEGED TREN DE ARAGUA BOSS ADDED TO FBI\u2019S MOST WANTED, SANCTIONED BY TREASURY: 'NO BORDER WILL SHIELD HIM'The indictment alleges Ch\u00e9rizier and Richardson, after Ch\u00e9rizier was sanctioned, led a wide-ranging conspiracy with people in the U.S., Haiti and other places to raise money for Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s gang activities, in violation of the sanctions.Specifically, the two men solicited money from members of the Haitian diaspora in the U.S.\"After sending funds to intermediaries in Haiti for Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s benefit, the U.S. and Haitian co-conspirators would send Ch\u00e9rizier images of receipts from money transfers,\" the DOJ said. \"Ch\u00e9rizier used these funds principally to pay salaries to the members of his gang and to acquire firearms from illicit firearms dealers in Haiti.\"The Trump administration, in May, designated Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif \u2013 two of Haiti\u2019s most powerful gang networks \u2013 as foreign terrorist organizations and specifically designated terrorists.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe move was aimed at disrupting the gangs\u2019 operations and supporting efforts to restore order in the troubled Caribbean nation.The designations brought serious legal consequences. Individuals or entities that provide material support to Viv Ansanm or Gran Grif could face criminal charges, loss of immigration benefits or removal from the U.S.",

Now, he is also being charged with two counts of first-degree murder under D.C.'s criminal code.\nANTI-ISRAEL GUNMAN FACES FEDERAL HATE CRIME CHARGES IN DEADLY DC EMBASSY STAFFERS SHOOTING\nThe DOJ said that multiple charges in the indictment carry the maximum penalty of death or life imprisonment. It will be up to Attorney General Pam Bondi to determine if the DOJ will seek the death penalty for Rodriguez.\n\"This office will leave no stone unturned in its effort to bring justice to the innocent victims of Elias Rodriguez,\" Pirro said in a DOJ press release.\nDuring a news conference on Thursday, Pirro said that Rodriguez's actions against Milgrim were particularly cruel, but declined to give details, noting they would be revealed during the trial. However, she did say that Milgrim was \"particularly vulnerable due to infirmity.\"\n\"The decision of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute the assassin of two embassy diplomats to the fullest extent of the law is a testament to the seriousness with which the administration relates to the upturn in anti-Israel hate speech and violence against Jews and Christian Zionists,\" a spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy in D.C. told Fox News Digital.\nCourt documents indicate that Milgrim was seen on video trying to crawl away from Rodriguez after being shot \"several\" times, at which point the suspect \"followed behind her and fired again.\" Then, Rodriguez appeared to reload his firearm as Milgrim sat up, at which point the suspect allegedly fired at her several times, documents say.\nPirro said there were two other victims, identifying them as C.S. and A.T.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOn May 22, Rodriguez allegedly fatally shot Milgrim and Lischinsky, two Israeli Embassy staffers who were attending an event at the Capital Jewish Museum that was hosted by the American Jewish Committee. Milgrim and Lischinsky were outside the venue when the shots were fired. The DOJ did not give details on how Rodriguez allegedly victimized C.S. and A.T.\nAfter the fatal shots were fired, Rodriguez allegedly went into the museum, pulled out a red keffiyeh \u2014 a Palestinian scarf \u2014 and said, \"I did it for Palestine. I did it for Gaza.\""

      "text": "Immigration: What to know about border security, US immigration policy and more\nImmigration in the United States has become a controversial topic in the political arena. There are several steps one must take to become a U.S. citizen, which are outlined on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. These steps include preparing an application for naturalization, paying fees, completing an interview and taking the oath of allegiance to the United States.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration prioritized securing the border and cracking down on the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the country. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws. Since beginning his second term in the White House, Trump has worked to initiate the deportation of undocumented immigrants.\nThousands of people gathered in downtown Los Angeles for protest demonstrations over immigration. The scene turned from peaceful to violent as rising unrest prompted police to deploy tear gas. The Los Angeles immigration protests were among other nationwide protests against federal immigration raids conducted by ICE agents. California Gov. has continued to blame Trump for the escalating protests, claiming that they were peaceful demonstrations before the National Guard and Trump's rhetoric intensified the conflict.\n\u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the nation's newest detention facility for undocumented immigrants, is located in the Florida Everglades and surrounded by swampland teeming with alligators and pythons. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized the construction of the detention center on a 30-square-mile property in the swamplands of Miami-Dade County under an emergency order in June 2025. The property, a former airport, has been outfitted with sturdy tent structures to house 5,000 undocumented immigrants amid the Trump administration's deportation blitz to remove the millions of migrants who entered the country during the Biden administration."
