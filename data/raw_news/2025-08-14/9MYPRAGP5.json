  "description": "A new spy thriller has just landed on Prime Video and viewers have been left in awe of the action-packed series.",
  "content": "Prime Video has stealthily unleashed a captivating thriller series that possesses all the ingredients of a colossal success. The complete six-episode run of this adrenaline-fuelled drama landed yesterday (Wednesday, 13th August) and has already garnered rave reviews from viewers who've dived in. Featuring The Good Doctor and Lost icon Daniel Dae Kim alongside Yellowstone's Piper Perabo, Butterfly represents essential viewing for enthusiasts of gripping espionage drama. The mayhem also contains surprising depth as Kim's operative David Jung reconnects with his killer daughter Rebecca (portrayed by Reina Hardesty) in a heart-stopping game of cat and mouse spanning South Korea. Perabo embodies Juno, the chief of clandestine intelligence organisation Caddis and Jung's former ally, who dispatches her most lethal assassins on a quest to eliminate him, reports the Mirror.\n\nWhilst the series hasn't yet soared up the rankings, it's merely a question of time and viewers have the opportunity to join the excitement before it potentially transforms into one of Prime Video's most discussed fresh offerings. Simply consider these delighted audiences who unanimously believe Butterfly merits binge-watching this week. Television critic Klepcx concurred: \"@PrimeVideo's live-action adaptation of the 2014 @boomstudios comic #Butterflyseries elevates its main characters by creating an original world of colorful villains and espionage.\n\n\"By taking its own liberties through a narrative slow burn, Butterfly still manages to entertain through its action sequences, high stakes, suspense, and a major plot-twisting ending!\" Another enthusiast chimed in: \"Butterfly is the best new show I have seen in a long time. Must watch. I do warn you, if you start it, have time to binge all 6 episodes.\" One glowing five-star review on Google stated: \"Butterfly is a phenomenal show IMHO! It has the soul of the Bourne series, but with its own unique identity.",
