  "content": "Kim Kardashian is coming under fire for North West 's new piercing.\n\nWhile the SKIMS founder and her 12-year-old daughter were recently vacationing in Rome , eagle-eyed fans spotted what appears to be a dermal piercing on North's middle finger. Also known as microdermal piercings or single-point piercings, dermal piercings lie flat against the skin and don't have a separate entry and exit point, per Byrdie .\n\nIn photos snapped on Aug. 23, Kardashian, 44, wore a black bodycon silk dress, while North wore a black corset, a skirt and knee-high boots. The tween's electric blue hair was styled in two ponytails that reached below her waist. In addition to her fresh piercing, she accessorized with a heart-shaped purse, glasses and lots of bracelets.\n\nIn a TikTok , posted on the mother-daughter duo's joint account, the pair showed off their outfits as they danced to Destroy Lonely's \"If Looks Could Kill.\"\n\nThe fashion moment is coming under fire, with many fans saying that North is too young for a dermal piercing, which some say can be more painful and prone to infection than other types of piercings. One user called out the piercing in a Keeping Up With the Kardashians  subreddit , prompting many to criticize Kardashian.\n\n\"She's 12. Wtf is Kim doing?!\" one user wrote.\n\n\"Who the f--- lets their 12 year old have piercings? And who the f--- pierces a 12 year old? My kid didn\u2019t even have her ears pierced at 12,\" said another.\n\nOthers expressed their concern about the healing process.\n\nOne user shared: \"That makes me wince just looking at it\ud83d\ude23\ud83e\udd22 It must be so irritating! And in the perfect place to be infected all the time.\"\n\nSaid another: \"That's going to be impossible to heal...\" \n\nKardashian, who is also mom to Psalm, 6, Chicago, 7, and Saint, 9, has spoken about her oldest daughter being a \"big critiquer\" of her fashion looks.\n\nWhile speaking with s correspondent Emma Chamberlain on the blue carpet at the 2025 Met Gala, Kardashian insinuated that her daughter was embodying the spirit of fashion icon Joan Rivers .\n\n\"She's a big critiquer, but it's pretty good, you know, her critiquing,\" she said when Chamberlain asked her what North has taught her about fashion. \"But you know just be yourself, right? She's ... also, I think, in a really positive place, like vibe, right now, where it's just like, 'Hey, even if that's not my style, I'm not going to critique that because just be you and if you like that then that's what you should be into.'\"\n\n\"So, I love that energy, and so she was such a positive force tonight, like it was great,\" Kardashian concluded.",

      "text": "Looking to up your body jewelry game? Dermal piercings are a popular option for areas traditionally too difficult to pierce. By anchoring into the skin, rather than through the skin, dermal piercing can be placed on almost any flat surface of the body.\n\"It's actually a single point piercing that is anchored to hold tight to the surface of the skin with a beautiful gemstone or flat piece of jewelry on top,\" says Jessie Darling, a professional body piercer at Taunton Tattoo Company in Ontario, Canada. \"Most commonly, dermals [sic] are placed under the eyes or [on the] collar bones, back dimples, arms, hips, or chest.\"\nMeet the Experts\n- Jessie Darling is a professional body piercer at Taunton Tattoo Company in Ontario, Canada\n- Deanne Mraz, MD, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist in Connecticut.\nWith these types of piercings, the possibilities feel endless. So, we tapped Darling and a board-certified dermatologist to break down everything there is to know about them. Read on for their insight to dermal piercings.\nDermal Piercing\nPlacement: Dermal piercings can be placed on any flat surface of the body, but are most commonly placed under the eyes, on the collar bones, back dimples, back of the neck, arms, hips, forearms, or chest.\nPricing: Between $70 and $100, though jewelry is an additional charge.\nPain level: 3/10\nHealing time: 1-3 months\nAftercare: Thoroughly clean the area once a day, pat dry with a clean piece of paper towel, then apply a fresh Band-Aid. Repeat for seven days.\nWhat Is a Dermal Piercing\nDermal piercings\u2014also known as microdermal piercings or single-point piercings\u2014are piercings that lie flat against the surface of the skin. The completely flat effect occurs because dermal piercings don\u2019t have a separate entry and exit point; instead, a dermal anchor is installed directly under the skin. This anchor is around six or seven millimeters long, and the top of it sits on the surface layer of the skin, making it look like there are beads directly underneath the dermis. The jewelry is then installed by being screwed into the top of the post.\nDermal Piercing vs. Surface Piercing\nWhile many people tend to interchange the two, dermal and surface piercings are very different. A dermal piercing can be placed underneath any flat surface of the body, though it sits on the surface of the skin. A surface piercing, which has a separate entry and exit point, is created by pinching the skin, sticking a needle through it to create a \u201cpassageway\u201d for the jewelry, and inserting a barbell into the flesh so both ends are visible while the middle sits below the surface of the skin.\nPain Level of Dermal Piercings\nJust like with any body modification, there is going to be some pain when it comes to dermal piercings. Unless your pain tolerance is extremely high, you will most likely feel some sort of discomfort\u2014whether a pinch or a more visceral feeling.\n\"Dermal piercings feel like pressure,\" notes Darling. \"Everyone is a little different, so pain levels may differ from others. Most of my clients say it wasn't as bad as they expected!\"\nIt\u2019s fairly dependent on where you choose to place your dermal piercing as well. Considering nerve placement, the different thicknesses of skin, and proximity to veins will be helpful when choosing a placement, as they\u2019re all elements that affect how much a piercing will hurt.\nCommon Placement for Dermal Piercings\nAs mentioned before, one of the best things about dermal piercings is their ability to be placed anywhere flat on the body. Some of the most popular areas to get a dermal piercing include: The chest, lower back, thighs, cheekbones, back of the neck, forearm, hand, and even dimples. The nature of dermal piercings is that if you can imagine piercing it, you most likely can. You can spruce up a tattoo with a dermal piercing, highlight a facial feature you love, or even pierce your neck or wrist for some permanent jewelry.\nProcess of Getting a Dermal Piercing\nThe process of a dermal piercing is much simpler than it may seem. First, your skin is cleaned by the piercer to ensure no bacteria gets into the fresh wound, and a small mark is drawn to indicate where the jewelry will go. The piercer will quickly puncture the skin with a needle or skin punch to create an empty space (or \u201cpocket\") where the metal will sit. Then, the anchor of the jewelry is inserted into the small opening by the piercer\u2014either by hand or with a small pair of forceps\u2014until it\u2019s completely under the skin\u2019s surface. Once set, the top is screwed or placed on, depending upon the type you\u2019ve chosen. The whole process only takes a matter of minutes; a good artist will probably spend more time sterilizing than actually piercing.\n\"The area is disinfected thoroughly, [then] marked with a marker to make sure you and I like the placement,\" says Darling. \"We then use a tool called a dermal punch to remove a little (1.5 to 2 millimeter) pocket of skin. We then use a taper tool that allows us to create room for the anchor base to fit snug. Lastly, we place an anchor base with decorative top into our pocket and gently make sure it's sitting properly. You now have a dermal!\"\nDermal Piercing Aftercare\n\"I suggest to my clients thoroughly cleaning the area once a day, pat dry with a clean piece of paper towel, then apply a fresh bandage,\" says Darling. \"This routine should be faithfully adhered to for seven days; beyond the seventh day, no bandage is required, but proper hygiene is key for a happy and healthy dermal.\"\nDuring the healing process, make sure that you keep the fresh piercing site covered for the recommended amount of time. Once you uncover it, it\u2019s important to clean it twice a day with a sea salt or saline solution, making sure to gently wipe any crusty build-up, and pat the piercing dry with a new paper towel each time to stop any potential spread of bacteria. Board-certified dermatologist, Deanne Mraz, MD says to also avoid swimming, hot tubs, and baths while the piercing is healing as \"those activities can submerge the open wound in an environment that contains bacteria and irritants.\"\nOn average, dermal piercings take between one to three months to heal; however, the length of time completely depends on how you care for it. \"Healing timeline can be impacted by your consistency with aftercare instructions, lifestyle habits, and the location on your body\u2014some areas of the body, such as the cheeks, can take closer to eight to 12 months to heal,\" explains Dr. Mraz. While you should keep an eye out for possible signs of infection, it\u2019s normal for a new piercing site to crust up and slightly swell.\nThe healing process can be hindered by elements you may not think of. Make sure not to let your hair get tangled in the jewelry if the piercing is near it; consider wearing it up during the healing process to ensure they don\u2019t get tangled up. In terms of clothing, don\u2019t wear anything tight around the piercing site so it can breathe and to decrease the risk of infection. Be careful of sports or high-energy exercise, as collisions are possible and extra sweat may mean a higher risk of infection. Keep hands off the piercing when not cleaning it, including not changing the jewelry until it has fully healed.\nCost of Dermal Piercing\nThe cost of a dermal piercing is completely up to the studio, but a well-done one by a reputable and experienced piercer will generally cost you between $70 and $100. It\u2019s important to note that many shops will also charge for jewelry on top of the actual piercing service, so be prepared to pay anywhere from $10 to $50 or more for good quality (and good looking) metal.\nOn top of the base and jewelry prices, there are a few more elements that need to be taken care of as well. Just like getting a tattoo, it\u2019s standard and expected that you tip your piercer for their hard work\u2014at least 20 percent, but more if you feel so inclined. There are also costs associated with aftercare, like saline solution and bandages.\nThe best way to get an accurate idea of how much a dermal piercing will actually cost is to call the shop ahead of your appointment and ask what they charge, as well as what they recommend for aftercare so you can be prepared before it\u2019s even scheduled.\nPotential Side Effects of a Dermal Piercing\n- Infection: If the healing process is not handled properly, your new piercing could become infected. If you have worsening pain at the site of piercing, your skin feels hot to the touch, or you notice swelling, rash, discharge, or a bad odor you should see your doctor immediately,\" says Dr. Mraz. It\u2019s not just the actual wound that shows symptoms; your jewelry may become displaced, hang or droop, or completely detach from its anchor.\n- Tissue damage: If a piercing infection isn\u2019t caught, there\u2019s a risk of something worse happening. The primary major risk is tissue damage, which happens when the piercing isn\u2019t installed properly. If it\u2019s too deep in the skin, a dermal piercing may embed and pull skin layers together. A shallow piercing, on the other hand, may move around.\n- Hypergranulation: Another possible issue is hypergranulation, which is a red bump that shows up around the piercing site due to too much pressure being placed on the site\u2014either by jewelry that is too tight, non-breathable clothing, or something else.\n- Scarring: Developing scars is also possible if you play with or remove your jewelry during the healing process. \"[Scarring] can happen in the form of a keloid (a raised scar) as well as hypergranulation, which will present as a raised, red bump that could even push your piercing out,\" says Dr. Mraz. \"If your dermal piercing is placed too deep in the skin and/or becomes infected, the body may reject it, physically pushing it out of the skin.\" The best way to ensure nothing goes wrong during healing is to follow all directions, keep the wound clean, and get pierced by a certified professional in the first place.\nHow to Change Dermal Piercing Jewelry\nOnce the piercing has healed, you\u2019re more than welcome to change the external jewelry. If you feel confident in this process, you can try it yourself. Make sure to wash your hands and piercing thoroughly\u2014with antibacterial soap and saline solution, respectively\u2014before drying it. Unscrew the jewelry top counterclockwise, but never force it. If there\u2019s any resistance, stop the process. Twist your new jewelry on in a clockwise direction and clean the site again. If your jewelry is stubborn or you\u2019re unsure whether you\u2019re doing it correctly, it\u2019s recommended that you have your piercer change the jewelry to be sure it\u2019s done safely and correctly.\nNo matter what it looks like, though, a dermal piercing isn\u2019t permanent; your skin will eventually grow in such a way that pushes the anchor up to the surface and out. Whether this happens right as it heals or years later is up to your body and how you care for it. However, if you don\u2019t want to wait for your body to naturally purge your dermal piercing, it is possible to have it removed by a professional piercer. Never take out a dermal piercing on your own.\n\"Dermals can last as long as you properly care for them,\" Darling says. \"I have clients who have had dermals for over eight years. If you treat them well, they could last a very long time. But don't fret; if you have a dermal you don't want anymore, it can also be removed by a skilled piercer or your family doctor.\"\nThere are two processes for taking out a dermal piercing. The first is done by having a piercer gently massage the piercing area to dislodge the anchor from its location under the skin. Once it\u2019s loose, the piercer will twist the anchor to break the skin and be able to pull it out. This process is generally reserved for newer piercings. For older or stubborn piercings, the piercer will make a small incision with a scalpel or tweezers (depending on the jewelry\u2019s size) and pull it out of the skin. While professionals may use anesthetics to dull the pain, you should expect a removed dermal piercing to leave a scar if the skin has to be cut open to remove it\nWhat Type of Jewelry Is Used for Dermal Piercings?\nDermal anchor: Although dermal piercings are small, they require a lot of different elements to be sure they\u2019re properly applied to the skin. The first major part is the dermal anchor, which comes in flat-footed and rounded-base varieties. These are both acceptable, but a flat-footed anchor is more common and more widely liked because the foot is at an angle, making it less likely to let go of your skin and pop out than a rounded-base type.\nDermal top: The next element is a dermal top, which is the actual jewelry that is screwed on to the top of the anchor and is completely removable and interchangeable. While possible to change, however, getting a dermal top switched out is generally done by a piercer, so you can also consider magnetic tops\u2014rather than screw-on ones\u2014if you\u2019d rather not have to go to a piercing shop every time you want to change up your piercing.\nDiver: In some cases, you may see a dermal piercing with a diver, a pointed-end base with preset jewelry. This is inserted by being punched under the surface of the skin, rather than by needle, and cannot be changed once inserted.\nWhat Jewelry Material Is Used for Dermal Piercings?\nRegardless of whether your jewelry can be switched up, the metals most used for dermal piercings are titanium (or anodized titanium), surgical-grade stainless steel, and niobium. The most common and most recommended metal for any body jewelry is surgical-grade stainless steel\u2014though it may cause irritation for those with more sensitive skin. Titanium (and anodized titanium) is the safest and best option for the latter, as it\u2019s the least likely metal to cause irritation of any kind. Niobium is less common, but is sometimes used for its lightweight and hypoallergenic properties.\nThe Final Takeaway\nWith proper care, dermal piercings offer countless styling options that not only look cool, but also make modifying body parts that would otherwise be difficult to pierce, possible. But do take heed of a final word of caution: Be careful when looking to get a dermal piercing, as some people actually mean surface piercings when they say dermal. The major difference here is that a surface piercing is a barbell that sits on the surface of the skin and has an entry and exit point."

Kardashian and West's divorce was finalized on Nov. 29, 2022, with the parents agreeing to joint physical and legal custody of their four children. \"Although Kim and Kanye share custody [of the kids], Kim is the primary caregiver,\" a source told PEOPLE. \"They agreed that Kanye needs to speak to Kim in private about any complaints and not go public with them. She wants the kids to be protected. Kim hopes the co-parenting will be a bit easier from now on.\" In a June 2023 episode of The Kardashians, the SKIMS founder talked to her mom, Kris Jenner, about not wanting more kids. \"I think I'm done,\" Kardashian remarked, adding that four kids is \"a lot.\" From welcoming their children to their sweet family moments, here's everything to know about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's kids.

I just want to learn how she learns in this world,\" Kanye said in 2016. \"I'm extremely protective.\" And North doesn't hold back her opinions \u2014 even when she's her mom's plus-one to Paris Fashion Week.

Who lives like this?' \" Kardashian explained in October 2021. \"She just thinks it, like, gets to me, and it is kind of mean because I like my house.\" In another interview, Kardashian joked, \"Who intimidates me? I was going to say politicians, but they don't. Maybe just my daughter, North.\" In May 2023, North joined her mom at the Met Gala, where she helped the SKIMS founder recover from a wardrobe malfunction.

Apparently, the rapper was \"going back and forth for a while\" before landing on Saint because he wanted the name to have \"spiritual significance.\" A friend of West told PEOPLE, \"It needed to mean something and he agonized over it, probably even more than Kim ... Kanye believes that a name is extremely important and that it's the first sense of identity that we have.\" Saint is a major sports fan.

While she often matched with her mom and big sister North as a toddler, she's since shown off her unique style, rocking a throwback Britney Spears T-shirt on one occasion and a bright pink jumpsuit with cowboy boots on another. Chicago is still taking a hint from her very stylish mom, however \u2014 Kardashian even once caught her trying to \"sneak off\" with a purse from her closet!

And he's such a blessing, so it's perfect.\" According to Kardashian, Psalm's arrival helped bring her family together. \"[North, Saint and Chicago] love him. He has helped everyone come together. So now everyone gets along,\" she told PEOPLE. \"Everyone loves each other. Everyone is helpful. And everyone loves him. Like, obsessed with him.\" Psalm West and Chicago West. Kim Kardashian Instagram Kardashian also called Psalm \"the sweetest baby ever\" on his 2nd birthday. \"He's my child that looks most Armenian to me like my grandpa and reminds me so much of my dad,\" the reality star wrote. When Psalm was a baby, Kardashian even thought he could be her father Robert Kardashian reincarnated because they share so many of the same characteristics. As the youngest of Kardashian and West's kids, Psalm spends plenty of time with his three siblings, whether they're playing in the sand on vacation or posing for silly photos before bedtime.
