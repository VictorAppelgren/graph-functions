      "summary": "VinFast, the electric‑vehicle arm of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup, began production in 2017 in Hai Phòng, Vietnam, and has recently entered the U.S. market with the VF8 crossover, though sales have been sluggish due to quality and performance issues. The company plans to shift entirely to EVs and is building a $4 billion plant in North Carolina, originally slated for 2025 but now expected to open in 2028. VinFast’s strategy includes a hybrid sales model and a focus on vertical integration, but its early U.S. experience highlights the challenges new EV entrants face in a mature market dominated by established players.",
