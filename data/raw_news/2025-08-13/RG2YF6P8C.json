  "description": "Upslope Capital Management, an investment management company, released its second-quarter investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The second quarter proved to be strong for the fund on both an absolute and relative basis due to strong performance backed by the market turbulence surrounding April\u2019s Tariff announcement.

  "content": "Upslope Capital Management, an investment management company, released its second-quarter investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The second quarter proved to be strong for the fund on both an absolute and relative basis due to strong performance backed by the market turbulence surrounding April\u2019s Tariff announcement. The fund returned +8.9% (net) in Q2 compared to +6.5% and +4.1% for the S&P Midcap 400 ETF (MDY) and HFRX Equity Hedge Index, respectively. In addition, you can check the fund\u2019s top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2025.\n\nIn its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, Upslope Capital Management highlighted stocks such as Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR). Headquartered in New York, New York, Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) is an investment banking company. The one-month return of Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) was 4.77%, and its shares gained 29.92% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On August 12, 2025, Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) stock closed at $307.88 per share, with a market capitalization of $11.884 billion.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\n\"FTI Consulting (FCN) and Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) \u2013 New Longs: Upslope has owned FTI Consulting (leader in restructuring and dispute advisory) and Evercore (top independent M&A advisor) in the past. The Fund recently re-initiated positions in each of these companies. While they are bets on polar opposite outcomes (Evercore is very pro-cyclical, while FTI is the most counter cyclical publicly traded company I follow), expectations for each appear modest. This was and remains especially true of FTI \u2013 although it\u2019s more understandable as the company is going through some turmoil (employee turnover/retention challenges) in one of its non-core segments. Nonetheless, the unique macro environment \u2013 on/off trade war, the very pro-cyclical \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d lingering inflation, massive regulatory and technological (e.g. AI) uncertainty and change \u2013 should ultimately provide significant opportunities for both businesses ahead.\"\n\nA close-up of a professional in a suit discussing financial transactions.\n\nEvercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 50 hedge fund portfolios held Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) at the end of the first quarter, which was 44 in the previous quarter. Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) reported adjusted net revenues of $834 million in Q2 2025 increased 21% from Q2 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.",

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes.

No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy?

      "text": "Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript July 30, 2025\nEvercore Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $2.59, expectations were $1.78.\nOperator: Good morning, and welcome to Evercore\u2019s Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Evercore management in the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Katy Haber, Managing Director of Investor Relations at Evercore. Please go ahead.\nKaty Haber: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Evercore\u2019s Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. I\u2019m Katy Haber, Evercore\u2019s Head of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today is John Weinberg, our Chairman and CEO; and Tim LaLonde, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for questions. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing Evercore\u2019s second quarter 2025 financial results. Our discussion of our results today is complementary to the press release, which is available on our website at evercore.com. This conference call is being webcast live in the For Investors section of our website, and an archive of it will be available for 30 days beginning approximately 1 hour after the conclusion of this call.\nDuring the course of this conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and there are important factors that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. These factors include but are not limited to, those discussed in Evercore\u2019s filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. I want to remind you that the company assumes no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In our presentation today, unless otherwise indicated, we will be discussing adjusted financial measures, which are non-GAAP measures that we believe are meaningful when evaluating the company\u2019s performance.\nFor detailed disclosures on these measures and the GAAP reconciliation, you should refer to the financial data contained within our press release, which is posted on our website. We continue to believe that it is important to evaluate Evercore\u2019s performance on an annual basis. As we have noted previously, our results for any particular quarter are influenced by the timing of transaction closing. I will now turn the call over to John.\nJohn S. Weinberg: Thank you, Katy. Before we review our second quarter financial results, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our announcement from earlier this morning. We\u2019ve entered into an agreement to acquire Robey Warshaw, a leading U.K.-based advisory firm with an extraordinary client franchise and relationships with some of the most prominent multinational companies in Europe. For 30 years, Evercore has been committed to delivering for clients by expanding our capabilities and talent each and every year, building a firm grounded in excellence and long-term high-quality growth. This acquisition continues that approach, enhancing our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders. Robey Warshaw\u2019s partners have advised on some of the largest and most complex transactions globally, including 7 of the 10 largest in U.K. history.\nThis year, Robey Warshaw advised Banco Santander on its $3.9 billion acquisition of TSB, Direct Line Insurance Group on its $4.5 billion acquisition by Aviva, and Johnson Matthey on its $2.4 billion sale of a CT division to Honeywell International. In the U.K., Robey Warshaw has been a trusted adviser to over 1/4 of the FTSE 100 and has significant reach in the continent and globally. Robey Warshaw\u2019s business is highly complementary to Evercore\u2019s broad and growing EMEA platform. This acquisition is a significant step in our global expansion strategy by combining Robey Warshaw\u2019s long-standing trusted relationships with large cap clients and Evercore relationships, broad product capabilities, deep sector expertise and global reach, we are enhancing the value we can deliver to clients around the world.\nAs you have seen, we\u2019ve been accelerating our growth in EMEA in recent years, including key additions in France, Spain and most recently, Italy. This acquisition will further strengthen our presence in the U.K. and the broader region. It will also strengthen our global efforts as we continue to serve large multinational companies on their most important transactions, including cross-border. With the addition of the Robey Warshaw, Evercore will have more than 400 bankers across 9 countries in the region. We believe this transaction will unlock synergies, creating value for our shareholders and enhancing our ability to serve clients. Importantly, their values are an excellent match with ours as commitment to partnership and collaboration and to long-term client relationships, excellence, integrity and independence.\nWe are looking forward to welcoming the Robey Warshaw team to Evercore and to what we will achieve together on behalf of our clients. Now let me discuss our business and second quarter results. Despite the rapidly changing market conditions experienced throughout the second quarter, Evercore delivered strong results, generating adjusted net revenues of $839 million, up nearly 21% year-over-year. In the first half of 2025, Evercore generated over $1.5 billion in adjusted net revenue, a 20% increase compared to the same period a year ago. These results represent record revenues for both second quarter and first half. The strength and resilience we have demonstrated so far this year reflect the execution of our growth strategy and the versatility of our business model, which enable us to serve our clients and deliver results for our shareholders in various types of environments.\nSince the market disruption in late March and in early April, business conditions have improved with increasing CEO confidence levels, receptive debt and equity issuance markets and healthy engagement with both corporates and sponsors. Year-to-date, through the end of the second quarter, industry-wide global M&A volumes were 30% higher than a year ago, with volumes increasing steadily each month. Our backlogs continue to build throughout the quarter and our client dialogue activity remains robust. While uncertainties remain, we continue to be optimistic about the path forward. As we move through the year, we expect greater clarity and stability in the market, which should support continued improvement in the investment banking environment. Shifting to talent.\nWe continue to make progress on our recruitment goal. Since our last earnings call, 4 senior managing directors have joined our investment banking practice in private capital advisory, health care, industrial and in Italy. And 3 investment banking SMDs have committed to join our franchise, 2 focused on logistics and transportation and 1 focused on ratings advisory. So far for the year, 9 investment banking SMDs and 1 senior adviser have started at the firm or will be joining later in the year, and we continue to have a solid pipeline of external candidates. Attracting and developing the highest quality talent continues to be a core priority for us. The senior level talent we\u2019ve hired and promoted over the past several years is contributing meaningfully to our results.\nNow let me briefly discuss the quarter. As noted earlier, we delivered strong year-over-year growth across our diversified mix of businesses in both the second quarter and the first half. In fact, in the second quarter and over the last 12 months, approximately 50% of our total revenues were from non-M&A sources, reflecting the strength of our diversified platform. In M&A, we advised on a number of notable and complex transactions in the quarter, including Cox Communications merger with Charter Communications, valuing Cox Communications of $34.5 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery on its separation in 2 leading media companies, a transaction that leverages the expertise of multiple teams across the firm and the sale of Foot Locker to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods for $2.5 billion.\nWe\u2019ve continued to experience strong momentum in July, advising Becton, Dickinson on the combination of its Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters in a $17.5 billion Reverse Morris Trust transaction and advising Huntington Bancshares on its acquisition of Veritex Holdings for $1.9 billion. Year-to-date, we have advised on 4 of the 10 largest global transactions and remain active in a wide range of high-quality complex transactions spanning mid-cap, large-cap and mega cap deal sizes. Our European business saw growth in the quarter with an increase in activity across most sectors and products and momentum for deal activity in the region continues to build. Activity among financial sponsors continues to strengthen, and we are experiencing strong levels of sponsor dialogue.\nOur strategic defense and shareholder advisory group remained highly active as the number of activist campaigns in the U.S. reached new records in the first half of the year. The liability management and restructuring group continues to see strong activity levels. Private equity-led situations remain a key driver, and we expect the business to stay active in the near term as sponsors and corporates navigate upcoming maturity walls, elevated interest rates and broader market uncertainty. Our industry-leading Private Capital Advisory business delivered a record first half and second quarter, driven by unprecedented volumes in GP-led continuation funds LP secondaries and securitization. We advised on many of the most significant transactions across these products, including several high-profile secondary market deals for endowments and pension funds.\nTrends in our private funds group remain in line with the first quarter as fundraising conditions continue to be challenging. However, our team remains active and expect a pick up in activity towards the end of the year, consistent with seasonal patterns. After a slowdown in activity in April, the equity capital markets has seen signs of recovery with dollar issuance volumes in the second quarter, reaching the highest level since the first quarter of 2021, so the number of transactions is still down year-over-year. Our Underwriting business experienced an uptick in activity in May and June, and we expect these positive trends to continue as we enter the second half. Our Equity franchise had its strongest second quarter ever, driven by market volatility, increased trading volumes and strong client engagement.\nLastly, Wealth Management reached a record quarter end AUM of approximately $14.5 billion, driven by market appreciation and net inflows. Before I turn it over to Tim, I\u2019d like to make 1 final comment. We remain committed to executing on our growth strategy and on creating value for both our clients and our shareholders. This is evident in our year-to-date financial results and in our acquisition of Robey Warshaw. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTimothy Gilbert LaLonde: Thank you, John. We are excited to have the Robey Warshaw team joining and believe this will provide significant benefits to Evercore. Over the last 3 years, Robey Warshaw has produced average annual revenues of over GBP 60 million or more than $80 million. As you can see in the press release, the consideration we are paying is GBP 146 million or approximately $196 million, payable in 2 tranches with the first payment in Evercore stock at closing and the second payment at the 1-year anniversary in stock or cash to be mutually agreed by Evercore and Robey Warshaw. There is also potential additional consideration, which is based on defined performance criteria over a multiyear period of time. The transaction is expected to close around the beginning of the fourth quarter of this year.\nWe expect it to be accretive to Evercore\u2019s adjusted and GAAP EPS in our first full year together and thereafter. We will continue to maintain strong liquidity and conservative debt levels and are committed to building value for our shareholders. Now I will discuss our financial results for the second quarter. Evercore\u2019s second quarter reflected improving market conditions and strong results across our diversified mix of businesses. The second quarter of 2025, net revenues, operating income and EPS on a GAAP basis were $834 million, $150 million and $2.36 per share, respectively. My comments from here will focus on non-GAAP metrics, which we believe are useful when evaluating our results. Our standard GAAP reporting and a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results can be found in our press release, which is on our website.\nOur second quarter adjusted net revenues of $839 million increased 21% versus the second quarter of 2024, which was a record for the second quarter, and we also achieved record revenues for the first 6 months of the year. Second quarter adjusted operating income of $157 million increased 37% versus the second quarter of 2024. The adjusted earnings per share of $2.42, increased 34% versus the second quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating margin was 18.7% for the second quarter, up from 16.4% in the prior year period, an improvement of 230 basis points. Turning to the businesses. Second quarter adjusted Advisory fees of $698 million increased 23% year-over-year, which is a record for the second quarter. First half results also represented a record for the Advisory business.\nOur second quarter Underwriting revenues were $32 million, up 4% from a year ago. Commissions and related revenue of $58 million in the quarter increased 10% year-over-year. The strength in the quarter was primarily driven by heightened trading volumes in April resulting from increased levels of volatility. Second quarter adjusted Asset Management and Administration Fees of $21 million, rose 3% year-over-year driven by market appreciation and net inflows. Second quarter adjusted other revenue net was approximately $29 million, which compares to $22 million a year ago, slightly more than half of that is related to gains in our DCCP hedge portfolio, which is correlated to the performance of the broader equity market, and the balance of the other revenue is primarily related to interest income.\nTurning to expenses. The adjusted compensation ratio for the second quarter is 65.4%, down 60 basis points from the prior year period and down 30 basis points from last quarter. Our compensation ratio for the quarter reflects a gradual improvement in the investment banking environment and an improvement in our revenue. As you have seen from the recent announcements, we are continuing to invest and execute on our strategic growth plan, which may create a time lag for making meaningful improvement in our comp ratio in the near term. Adjusted noncompensation expenses in the quarter were $133 million, up 9% from a year ago. The increase year-over-year is primarily driven by 2 things: the first is technology and information services expense, which rose due to higher renewal costs for market data and licensing fees and those costs tend to rise faster than the rate of inflation.\nAnd the other is the implementation and development of new software applications, which are intended to create efficiencies and facilitate our client coverage and service efforts. The second is occupancy and equipment expense, which increased due to higher rents and costs associated with the addition of new floors in our New York headquarters and new offices related to our expansions in Chicago, Paris, Dubai and London. Our adjusted noncomp ratio for the quarter is at 15.9%, 170 basis points below the ratio for the prior year period and 180 basis points below last quarter\u2019s ratio, benefiting from our revenue increase. Over a significant period of time, there is a correlation between head count and noncomp expenses with some additional increase related to inflation.\nIf we look at our noncomp expense on a per head basis year-over-year, our second quarter adjusted noncomp expense would be up 2.4% per employee. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we are maintaining a disciplined focus on managing our noncompensation expenses while investing in areas that are necessary to support our growth. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30% compared to 26.9% in the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate was primarily related to an increase in nondeductible expenses and an increase in taxes related to state and local apportionment. Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash and investment securities totaled over $1.7 billion, and we continue to be cash flow positive. In the first 6 months of the year, we returned $532 million of capital to shareholders through the repurchase of shares and the payment of dividends.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased just under 200,000 shares at an average price of $236.05 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $258.5 per share. We fully offset the dilution associated with RSU grants from our 2024 bonus cycle and returned more capital to our shareholders in the first half of this year than in any other consecutive 2-quarter period in our history. Our second quarter adjusted diluted share count was 43.5 million shares, relatively in line with the prior year and down approximately 850,000 shares from the first quarter. The decline in the share count reflects a full quarter impact of repurchases during the first quarter and the accounting impact with respect to unvested RSUs as our weighted average share price declined in the second quarter.\nGiven the increase in our share price third quarter to date, we would expect to see our share count modestly increased in the third quarter due to the same accounting impact on RSUs from our share price that caused our share count to decrease this quarter. Additionally, in July, we issued 2 tranches of senior notes in the form of a private placement for a total of $250 million. We issued $125 million of 5.17% Series K Notes due in 2030 and $125 million of 5.47% Series L Notes due in 2032. The use of proceeds is to repay 2 tranches of notes that are maturing, one in August of 2025 and one in March of 2026 and totaling about $86 million, and the remainder is for general corporate purposes. We continue to maintain a strong cash position and take into consideration our regulatory requirements, the current economic and business environment, cash needs for the implementation of our strategic initiatives, including hiring plans and preserving a solid financial footing.\nAs we enter the second half of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver solid results as we have continued to demonstrate that our diversified business model performs well in all types of environments. With that, we will now open the line for questions.\nQ&A Session\nFollow Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR)\nFollow Evercore Inc. (NYSE:EVR)\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from James Yaro with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Edwin Yaro: I wanted to start with the Robey Warshaw transaction. Would you be able to provide any additional color around the business profile for Robey Warshaw, specifically, what aside from M&A advisory they offer today?\nJohn S. Weinberg: Thanks, James. They are primarily a top-level adviser, spend a great deal of their time in the C-suite and with Boards. They are very strategic, and they have based their business on giving strategic advice. They are knowledgeable about a full line of products but they really haven\u2019t been able to translate their knowledge and really the advisory position that they have into revenues. And one of the great synergies of this transaction, we believe, is that we have this very full product set, a very extensive industry sector group and analyzing. And what we are going to be able to do is really marry their extraordinary relationships with our capabilities, and we think that\u2019s going to be a real source of revenue and growth.\nSo I think that they \u2014 it\u2019s what they really have, which is absolutely extraordinary system, amazing client franchise, trusted relationships with so many very important companies. And I think that marrying that with our capabilities will actually be quite powerful.\nJames Edwin Yaro: That\u2019s great. For my second question, just around M&A, the backdrop, you sound constructive. But perhaps you could talk about whether in the boardroom, you\u2019re still seeing impacts from tariffs weighing on potential transactions.\nJohn S. Weinberg: Well, there\u2019s no question that there is not the full-on merger activity that you might have seen at the beginning of the year or that we anticipated. But having said that, I think that boards and management teams are getting more comfortable, and they believe they have more certainty, and so there is absolutely some building of activity in our backlog to build throughout our firm. And I think that we really believe that the activity levels could continue to grow, and the momentum could continue over the balance of this year. So the answer to your question really is that we see that people are becoming more comfortable there\u2019s more certainty. There is more clarity. Having said that, we don\u2019t think we have a full-on absolute roaring recovery at this moment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.\nRyan Michael Kenny: On the Robey Warshaw deal, so a very clear overview on how it aligns with your global expansion strategy and your culture. My question is when you think about Evercore\u2019s strategy for gaining global market share going forward, do you see yourself doing more acquisitions in the future to fuel growth? And is there any change in how you think about the mix of organic growth, hiring, M&A and supporting growth?\nJohn S. Weinberg: Our most important means of growth is going to continue to be hiring high-quality talent one by one. It\u2019s really the way we think it\u2019s the best way to do it and we\u2019re going to continue that. So if you think about how we\u2019re going to grow, we\u2019re going to continue it the way we have, which is on the basis of finding high-quality people and recruiting them. The reason we did Robey Warshaw is that we found an extraordinarily high-quality organization, which really had such a good match with us culturally and had some really interesting synergies from a business perspective. We would not be doing an acquisition if it hadn\u2019t been for Robey Warshaw. Having said that, we\u2019re not \u2014 not taking anything off the table. If something comes up, we\u2019ll evaluate it.\nBut I think if you think about us and how we\u2019re going to grow, we\u2019re going to aggressively grow one by one, we\u2019re going to continue to drive our pipeline. And I\u2019d say that this year, as you probably know, we really have 10 senior bank \u2014 10 senior people in and we have a really healthy pipeline and we\u2019re going to continue to grow that pipeline and execute on that pipeline. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with Citizens.\nDevin Patrick Ryan: Congrats on the deal. Question just on kind of the diversification of the business. So obviously, you highlighted again in the second quarter and actually last 12 months, approximately 50% of revenues were from non-M&A sources. So obviously a terrific job just kind of diversifying the business and seeing growth in some of those non-M&A businesses like private capital and restructuring and shareholder advisory but it\u2019s also been a tougher M&A market. So I\u2019m just curious if we should think about this as kind of a new baseline or kind of where you want to be from a mix perspective or is that simply as M&A kind of reaccelerate here these other businesses, maybe don\u2019t keep up until the mix goes back down to 40% or something less than that?\nJohn S. Weinberg: Well, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what the percentages are going to fall out to. But I would say that mergers is building. And our merger that \u2014 we are very leveraged on our merger business. And as our merger business builds, we believe it will, over time, build and really continue to be the loin \u2014 not the lion\u2019s share but a significant piece of really what we\u2019re able to do with clients. PCA restructuring, activism defense, those are very, very good businesses. I don\u2019t see them really slowing right now. I think that they all have really healthy activity levels, and we really don\u2019t see that there\u2019s going to be weakness there. But we do think the merger business will strengthen. And so then by definition, the merger business will probably pick up and do a higher percentage but we intend to continue to invest in our non-merger businesses.\nSo hopefully, over time, you\u2019ll see something that does approximate 40% or 50%. I don\u2019t know where it will fall in the middle of that. But clearly, we think that all of those businesses will grow and the merger business will probably grow faster as the market really does recover.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Bond with KBW.\nAlexander Scott Bond: So it looks like industry secondary volumes reached a new high in the first half of the year. And you also mentioned that PCA revenues reached new highs in both 2Q and the first half. So just wondering if you can go into a bit more detail on the outlook for industry volumes in this area in the back half of the year? And then also maybe how you think about the \u2014 how the competitive dynamics in the secondary space on the advisory side may evolve as broader momentum in this area continues.\nJohn S. Weinberg: Sure. Competitively, there\u2019s no question that there are many people who are talking about really ramping up their activity level here. And so I do believe the competition will heat up even more. We are very well positioned. We have an outstanding team. We have a lot of experience. We have a real track record of success. So we think we\u2019re going to compete very well in that. In terms of the second half, it was a very good first half, as we said. We continue to see a very strong activity level on really all fronts, both on the GP level, with continuity and the LP level, where we\u2019ve been involved in some of the most high profile of secondary sales. We think those \u2014 that we\u2019re going to continue. And I think that from our standpoint, I don\u2019t see a slowdown I do believe that we may not ramp as fast in the second half as we did but we feel very comfortable with the levels we\u2019re at right now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Brendan O\u2019Brien with Wolfe Research.\nBrendan James O\u2019Brien: Just a 2-parter here on expenses. I appreciate the potential top line synergies you mentioned earlier but I was hoping you can help us through the cost side of the equation and your ability to drive synergies by consolidating office space and tech infrastructure and the like. And then as we think about margins for the combined entity, Tim, I heard your comments on the comp ratio improvement but I just want to get a sense of your confidence in your ability to get your comp ratio back down to the sub-60% level once the cadence of hiring goes back to a more normal level?\nTimothy Gilbert LaLonde: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Brendan. Look, we \u2014 as I said on previous calls, both compensation and non-compensation expenses are a significant focus of the firm. On the compensation side, and I think I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re very focused on achieving optimal value for the shareholders by balancing our investing in people, which is how we grow our firm along with managing our expenses. As you mentioned, we did make some progress on the comp ratio this quarter. We made, what I would say, quite meaningful progress from where we were 2 years ago. And I\u2019m not satisfied with where we are. I think I\u2019d like to take it lower. I think the comp ratio you saw for this quarter is reflective of our best judgment in relation to an accrual that takes into consideration what happened during the quarter and also our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nSo as I sit here today, not seeing that in the next \u2014 the near term, which I would define as the next quarter or 2 quite significant changes because our accrual reflects what we currently see today. But we certainly are going to strive to make improvements looking beyond that. So that\u2019s on the compensation side. On the non-compensation side, as a percentage of revenues, you\u2019ll note that we made quite significant progress in this quarter, is the first point. Second is what I would say there is we do have some investments we\u2019re making. We \u2014 if you look at our noncomps, they were up about $11 million year-over-year, and that\u2019s really attributable to 2 primary areas and one is the occupancy, which is up, and that\u2019s simply a reflection of our growth in our expansion.\nAnd so we\u2019ve added office space in London. We\u2019ve added office space in Paris and Dubai in Italy and in Chicago as well as consolidating some of our corporate people into one location in Manhattan. So that\u2019s what would explain that. And I think that\u2019s just a natural part of the growth. And then the other is investment in technology. And we all know that we\u2019re at, I would say, historical inflection point in technology, and we\u2019re investing to make sure we take advantage of the improvements we\u2019re seeing and then hoping to realize productivity gains from that. Now one of the ways we look at our noncomps is we look at it on a per head basis because as I\u2019ve said historically, the \u2014 there\u2019s a correlation between head count growth and noncomp factoring a little bit for inflation.\nAnd if you look back to the pre- COVID year on a per head basis, our noncomps would be up about 13%. That\u2019s over 6 years. And so that\u2019s just a little over 2% per year, which I would attribute to inflationary pressures. And so that\u2019s kind of how we think about it and where we think we\u2019re headed.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next again to James Yaro with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Edwin Yaro: Follow up. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the Robey Warshaw financing, if there is any. Would you consider issuing stock either of the first 2 tranches. Could you talk a little bit about the consideration between for the second tranche stock versus cash? And then perhaps you could talk a little bit about the performance incentives to the extent you can associated with potentially increasing the consideration?\nTimothy Gilbert LaLonde: Sure, James. Happy to. Now during my prepared remarks, 1 thing I just want to make sure it didn\u2019t go unnoticed as we did do a private notes offering where we raised $250 million in the form of 2 notes, one a 5-year note at 5.17%, and the second is the 7-year note at 5.47%. And so just wanted to make sure we noted that. On the Robey Warshaw transaction, you saw that our total what we call upfront consideration was in dollars, about $196 million, and is payable in 2 tranches, one at closing, one a year from now. And so think about it as about 49% and the one at closing about 51% at the time of the 1-year anniversary. The first tranche was payable in \u2014 or will be payable in stock. And as you know, we\u2019ve been very disciplined about trying to manage our share count.\nAnd so no guarantees because we take a lot of factors into consideration, but we certainly are giving strong consideration to repurchasing shares that would be similar to the number issued in the upfront payment on this. And so in a way, you might think about it as net cash. We love the idea of issuing shares and making sure our new colleagues are invested in the future as we all are. But I think from a shareholder standpoint, you could think about it as maybe netting out as we proceed in time and are giving strong consideration to repurchasing those shares. And then if you look at the balance of payments too, you should think about it is it could be some combination of stock and/or cash. But to the extent of stock, we, again, at that point, would consider give strong consideration to repurchasing shares.\nSo from a shareholder standpoint, over time, this should be thought of as a largely net cash transaction. That\u2019s the first point. Second, as you asked about any additional consideration. So of course, we noted in our press release that there is the potential for future consideration. And I think I\u2019m very pleased with the structure of the transaction because that potential future consideration is only earned to the extent of 2 things. Number one, that the Robey Warshaw outperforms our base assumptions in the projections that we used and number two, in the event that significant synergies and aligned goals are achieved. And if that happens, and they earn additional potential consideration that is a win-win because it also is very value accretive for our shareholders the way it\u2019s structured.\nJohn S. Weinberg: The only thing I would like to add is that there are 2 actual aspects that I think are important in addition. One is that the add-on value that they can be able to generate is really something that will bind them to the firm. And so the good news is we think we\u2019re going to get them for a good long time and that\u2019s, I think, from our standpoint, very valuable. And the second is that obviously, by having something, which is kind of somewhat of an earn-out, it aligns their interests and the firm\u2019s interest. The fit between them culturally and us is extraordinary. But this kind of an arrangement will continue to carry forward the incentives that are very much aligned, and I think that\u2019s an important point.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s Evercore Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."

      "text": "Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!\nAI is eating the world\u2014and the machines behind it are ravenous.\nEach ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nAI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it\u2019s about to get worse.\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:\n\u201cThe future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nTrump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.\nAnd our company sits in the toll booth\u2014collecting fees on every drop exported.\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2026\nAs Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.\nAI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.\nWhile the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.\nAI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.\nAnd infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.\nThis company has its finger in every pie\u2014and Wall Street is just starting to notice.\nWall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds\u2014without the sky-high valuation.\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock.
