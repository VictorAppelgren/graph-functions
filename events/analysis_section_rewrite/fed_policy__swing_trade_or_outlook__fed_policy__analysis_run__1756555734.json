      "feedback": "Your draft mixes multiple assets (10‑yr yield, mortgage spread, DXY) and contains redundant “Up/Down” lines that do not map cleanly to a single canonical handle. Tighten the focus to the 10‑yr Treasury as the primary asset: collapse the two “Up” scenarios into one “Fed‑funds futures flat, 10‑yr near 4.25% resistance” line, and merge the two “Down” scenarios into a single “Fed cuts 25 bp, PCE < 2.5 % → 10‑yr falls to ~4.10 %” line. Remove the extraneous “Down” line that merely repeats the current 4.23 % level. Ensure every line contains a clear causal chain: e.g., “Fed cuts → 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening → 10‑yr yield decline” with an inline citation (U21K4ALYQ)(97MD1FHW8). Add a probability that reflects the 88 % cut probability and the 60–70 % confidence band for the cut (XTQIQRP5K)(FAN5RYW6T). Replace vague “Fed holds rates” with the specific “Fed‑funds futures flat, 10‑yr near 4.25% resistance” and cite (97MD1FHW8). Finally, keep the trade/outlook line concise: “Down | 0‑3 weeks | 10‑yr yield | 4.23% → 4.10% | 4.20% support | 4.25% resistance | 4.10% target | 3:1 R/R | Fed cut | 60% | 70”. This streamlines the output, eliminates duplication, and satisfies the handle‑mapping and catalyst‑window requirements.",
