  "content": "An Avenger, Capt. Kirk and Ivan Drago will be in downtown San Jose this weekend as GalaxyCon returns for its second year.\n\nThe \u201cfestival of fandom\u201d, which opens Friday afternoon and runs through Sunday at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center, is expected to draw more than 30,000 people over the weekend \u2014 including many cosplayers whose elaborate outfits will make for great people-watching.\n\nBut the real draws are the celebs, who encompass a wide range of pop culture including movies and TV, comics, gaming, pro wrestling, voice acting and podcasts.\n\nThe big names scheduled to attend include Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye from Marvel\u2019s Avengers movies), cult-movie fan favorite Danny Trejo, Dolph Lundgren from \u201cRocky IV,\u201d and William Shatner, who is the closest thing to a Patron Saint of Pop Culture that we have in Silicon Valley.\n\nThere are also some great treats for horror movie fans, with cast members from \u201cTerrifier\u201d (Elliott Fullam and Laura Lavera) and the 1998 \u201cScream\u201d (Matthew Lilliard, Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy and original Ghostface Lee Waddell) taking part in Q&A panels.\n\nBarry Bostwick, who played Brad in 1975\u2019s \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show,\u201d also will have a special meet-and-greet event Saturday night before the 10 p.m. showing of the cult classic film, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. This will be similar to one of the regular \u201cmidnight\u201d shows at theaters (including San Jose\u2019s 3Below): a \u201cshadowcast\u201d performance with the Barely Legal live cast. Could Bostwick be persuaded to take part in the Time Warp? We can only hope.\n\nBeyond those events, there are countless photo opportunities, panel discussions, late-night events and costume contests available to conventiongoers (some involve an extra charge). You can get the full schedule and tickets at www.galaxycon.com/sanjose.",

If you do want the chance to check out the Waymo vehicles up close, though, you\u2019d better act fast. Ticket sales for the barbecue, presented by Sutter Health and sponsored by a bevy of other companies (including Mountain View-based Waymo), wrap up this week.\nGo to www.sjchamber.com/chamber-bbq for more details."

      "text": "Now that Dead & Company\u2019s wildly successful shows have ended at Golden Gate Park, it\u2019s San Jose\u2019s turn to honor the 60th anniversary of the Grateful Dead in December.\nSan Jose Rocks, a nonprofit dedicated to highlighting Santa Clara County\u2019s role in music history, has put its celebration plans into high gear to commemorate the site of the band\u2019s first show as the Grateful Dead on Dec. 4, 1965. The performance happened at an \u201cacid test\u201d party at a house on South Fifth Street in downtown San Jose. The house is no longer there, but in fitting irony, the building that happens to be on that site today is San Jose City Hall.\nDan Orloff, founder and executive director of San Jose Rocks, said initial design work is completed on a bronze plaque to commemorate the historic event, which city officials agreed to earlier this year.\n\u201cSan Jose was ground zero for the Grateful Dead\u2019s cosmic launch, and it\u2019s high time we crank up the volume on that legacy. This plaque is more than just bronze on a wall \u2014 it\u2019s a shoutout to the night the music got weird, wild, and wonderfully historic right here in our city. San Jose Rocks is proud to mark the spot where the Dead were born and history got loud.\u201d\nOrloff says the goal is to dedicate the plaque on Dec. 4, 2025. As part of San Jose Rocks\u2019 deal with the city, the nonprofit will be raising all the money to pay for the 20-by-30-inch bronze plaque \u2014 featuring the band\u2019s iconic \u201cSteal Your Face\u201d logo \u2014 and the celebration around its installation. That\u2019s where Orloff hopes that Grateful Dead fans in Silicon Valley and beyond will come in.\nSan Jose Rocks has arranged for a pretty cool donor gift, too. Contributors at various levels starting at $125 will receive limited-edition handbills or commemorative posters designed for this cause by artist Stanley Mouse, who created posters for the Bill Graham-promoted shows as well as album covers for the Grateful Dead and Journey. You can find out more at sanjoserocks.org/article/the-grateful-dead-tribute.\nEven San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan \u2014 who was barely a teenager when Jerry Garcia died in 1995 \u2014 is backing the project, saying the Dead are an \u201cundeniable part of San Jose\u2019s rich musical history.\u201d\n\u201cOur city council meetings are clearly not as exciting as a Dead show, but we\u2019re proud to host a plaque for fans to honor the legendary band\u2019s legacy where it all began, right here in San Jose,\u201d Mahan said in a statement.\nCREATIVE WEEKEND IN LOS ALTOS: The Fine Art in the Park festival is returning to Lincoln Park in Los Altos this weekend for its 50th year. The juried show features the work of more than 150 artists from across the country, who produced original paintings, sculptures, photographs, textiles and ceramics. The weekend will include live music, along with a food court featuring nearby favorites including Chef Chu\u2019s, Aurum, Redwood Grill, Rustic House and Taco Al Vapor.\nPurchases made during the show support scholarships, international disaster relief, clean water projects and other causes supported by the Los Altos Rotary Club. The show is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday, and admission is free. Get more information at www.rotaryartshow.com.\nHISTORIC HUNT: Sarah Winchester is pretty well-known in these parts thanks to her sprawling mansion, the Winchester Mystery House, which attracts droves of people every year to explore its 160 rooms and architectural oddities. But the life of her sister, Isabel Merriman, is probably a real mystery to most people in the Bay Area. That\u2019s why the Los Altos History Museum is spotlighting Merriman \u2014 who lived in the area that became Los Altos \u2014 with its latest exhibit, \u201cBuilding El Sue\u00f1o: Isabel Merriman, Sarah Winchester, and the California Dream.\u201d\nOn Saturday, the museum is inviting the public to take part in \u201cIsabel\u2019s Scavenger Hunt,\u201d from noon to 4 p.m. in its garden (with a prize going to the first 50 people who complete it). Museum Curator and Director of Exhibits Amy Ellison said the event is centered around Merriman\u2019s deep love for plants and animals. She grew a variety of flowers at her home, El Sue\u00f1o, and sold them at a floral shop she ran in Mountain View. She also served on the board of the Palo Alto Humane Society and cared for neglected animals.\nAppropriately, visitors can hang out with friendly therapy dogs from the Palo Alto Humane Society\u2019s \u201cVisiting Pals\u201d program from noon to 2 p.m. during the scavenger hunt. The exhibit, which opened in late June, runs through Nov. 30. You can get more information at www.losaltoshistory.org."

      "text": "There are several eye-catching items on display at \u201cV is for Victory in the Valley: Stories from World War II,\u201d a new exhibition that opened last weekend at History Park in San Jose, but three really stood out to me.\nThe first is an olive-green blanket that serves as the centerpiece of the exhibition, which opened last weekend and runs through October in the Leonard McKay Gallery at the Pasetta House. It\u2019s covered with military patches \u2014 collected by a young Janice Paull \u2014 from soldiers coming through San Jose who stopped at the post office her father ran. Some \u2014 like the emblem of the 101st Airborne and the 1st Cavalry \u2014 are easily recognizable but others are more obscure.\nHistory San Jose CEO Bill Schroh said he and Collections Curator Katrina Anderson have been using Google Lens to identify some of them. Possibly the most interesting one is the blanket\u2019s center: a \u201cblood chit\u201d that was carried by airmen identifying them as Americans fighting to help China against the Japanese.\nThe other is the flight jacket and other items, including a Distinguished Flying Cross, Silver Star and Flying Medal earned by Capt. Samuel L. Washington, a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, an all Black air squadron. Washington was from Cleveland but eventually settled in San Jose after the war.\nThe third is a photograph taken on South First Street in downtown San Jose after the war\u2019s end was announced in August 1945. There\u2019s a lot of jubilation on display, but as Schroh points out, the people in the photo are more diverse \u2014 both in ethnicity and social status \u2014 than modern viewers might have expected from a smaller agricultural city 80 years ago. (The theater in the photo\u2019s background is the long-gone Mission, close to where Urban Putt is now.)\nOf course, this Saturday would be a perfect time to visit the exhibition as the Spirit of \u201945 Living History Day and Swing Dance will be taking place, starting at 2 p.m. The annual celebration includes a fashion show, a victory parade, vintage cars and military vehicles and lots of family-friendly activities that tie back to World War II. The Chinese Historical and Cultural Project\u2019s museum will be among the park\u2019s historic buildings open Saturday, and it also has a new exhibit on the contributions of Chinese Americans to the war effort.\nThe whole day culminates in an evening swing dance accompanied by the Big Band music of Swing Solution. Admission varies from $10-$25 depending on whether you want to just go to the daytime portion, the evening festivities or the whole thing. Get more details and tickets at www.historysanjose.org.\nART IN THE SKY: There was a lot to take in at last weekend\u2019s San Jose Jazz Summer Fest \u2014 from a rousing set by the Pacific Mambo Orchestra to a soulful finale on the main stage delivered by 86-year-old legend Mavis Staples \u2014 so it\u2019s almost hard to believe there was a drone show on Saturday night, too.\nThe 13-minute show featured over 250 drones creating colorful animations in the sky over Park Avenue in downtown San Jose. Half of it celebrated Summer Fest, depicting jazz legends who\u2019ve played the fest like Etta James and Herbie Hancock, while the second half brought the \u201cAlebrijes en San Jose\u201d Mexican art exhibition to life.\nUnfortunately, a lot of festival attendees missed the 9:15 p.m. show entirely because main stage headliner P.J. Morton\u2019s set was still going on. And the music from the stage mostly drowned out the drone show soundtrack, curated by local DJ The CME. But if you did miss it, you\u2019ve got another chance to catch the drone show on Sept. 6 during Ritmo y Colores, a cultural festival at Plaza de Cesar Chavez.\nPARTY WITH A PURPOSE: Bandleader Tito Puente Jr. will headline this Saturday\u2019s Tres Vinos fundraiser for the School of Arts and Culture at the Mexican Heritage Plaza in downtown San Jose. Tickets for the dinner event, which includes a wine tasting, are available at www.schoolofartsandculture.org."

      "text": "Alebrijes \u2014 the bright towering art sculptures \u2014 have brought a welcome splash of color to downtown San Jose.\nA touring exhibit of eight 20-foot-tall multicolored statues of \u201cmagical animals\u201d has been installed in and around Plaza de Cesar Chavez this week, as part of the celebration of the 35th annual San Jose Jazz Summer Fest, which opens Friday night and runs through Sunday.\nThe jazz may fade away after this weekend, but \u201cAlebrijes en San Jose\u201d will continue to brighten downtown through Sept. 28, with several free, public events over the next few weeks around the Oaxacan art pieces.\nSan Jose Jazz Board President Julie Ramirez said both Summer Fest and the exhibition celebrate the rhythms and resilience of San Jose through music and art. \u201cThese towering Alebrijes are more than sculptures \u2014 they visit us as guardians of artistic expression and cultural heritage,\u201d Ramirez said.\nSan Jose Jazz Executive Director Brendan Rawson has long wanted to extend the festival\u2019s timeline and hustled to assemble sponsors to bring the art exhibit to San Jose. Summer Fest will include a drone show Saturday night that will highlight the alebrijes and bring them to life in the sky, Rawson said.\nThe eight 1,200-pound fiberglass sculptures glow in different colors at night, courtesy of LEDs inside each one, which depict creatures like coyote with a serpent tail, a CatBird, a LionBull, a rabbit, a dog, an armadillo and an alien. The exhibit celebrates the work of Mexico City artist Pedro Linares, who first created the art style of surrealistic animals and coined the term \u201calebrije.\u201d One of the artists who created the Alebrijes is his son, Leonardo Linares, and the smaller, original statues on which the big versions are based also are on display inside San Jose City Hall.\nThe artistic celebration started Wednesday night with a packed-to-the-rafters gala at the San Jose Museum of Art, organized by Mezcal restaurant owner Adolfo Gomez, who is from Oaxaca, Mexico. He brought together several of the Mexican chefs at Silicon Valley restaurants to show off their culinary artistry, including Jo Lerma-Lopez and Julio Juarez from Luna Mexican Kitchen, Azari Cuenca Maitret from Copita, Sandra Murillo from Petiscos, Luis Cruz from the Pressroom and, from Mezcal, Miguel Rovera, Tavo Gomez (Adolfo\u2019s brother) and Libo Gomez (Adolfo\u2019s mom).\n\u201cAs someone born in Oaxaca, seeing these monumental alebrijes come to life in the heart of downtown San Jose feels deeply personal and powerful,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cIn a time when immigrant communities are often politicized or erased, it\u2019s more important than ever to uplift and honor the cultures that shape this city.\u201d\nCELEBRATING INDIA: Festive is going to be the word of the day Saturday afternoon in downtown San Jose. San Jose Jazz\u2019s Summer Fest will be in full swing at Plaza de Cesar Chavez and the surrounding area. But Discovery Meadow also is expected to be packed with crowds attending Swades: Celebrate India Festival, which will include Indian dance and music performances, booths selling Indian street food, a shopping bazaar and family-friendly activities.\nThe festival, sponsored by the Association of Indo-Americans, starts at 1 p.m., and will include a 3:30 p.m. parade that will proceed south from the intersection of Almaden Boulevard and San Fernando Street to the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. You can get tickets or more information at www.aiaevents.org.\nSINGING FOR THEIR SUPPER: It looked like it might be curtains for the Lyric Theatre earlier this year, but donations have managed to keep the light opera company afloat \u2014 for now. But audiences can help out, and have a good time doing it, when the Lyric presents a special original musical revue, \u201cThe Great Gilbert & Sullivan Sing-Off,\u201d at the Saratoga Civic Theater.\nThe show involves three different companies competing in a Gilbert & Sullivan Festival, performing selections by the Victorian-era creators of such shows as \u201cH.M.S. Pinafore,\u201d \u201cThe Pirates of Penzance\u201d and \u201cThe Mikado.\u201d Each company will provide a wildly different experience for the audience, which will be asked to vote for their favorite at the end.\nIt\u2019s directed and conceived by Doreen Finklestein, who also worked on the script and some new lyrics with Cordelia Willis and Ronan Beltracchi. There are only three performances \u2014 Saturday at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets are available for $35-$55 at lyrictheatre.org.\nHAVE YOUR SAY, SAN JOSE: The San Jose Downtown Association is hosting a Public Safety Town Hall 6 p.m. Friday at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan and Santa Clara County Supervisor Betty Duong will talk about public safety challenges downtown and answer questions from the public at the event, which will be moderated by Alan \u201cGumby\u201d Marques, the Downtown Association\u2019s interim CEO.\nThe town hall is scheduled for 90 minutes and will be held in Room 230 at the convention center. It is free and open to the public, and questions can be submitted in advance at sjdowntown.com/town-hall.\nBear in mind that this is happening the same time that San Jose Jazz Summer Fest will be kicking off nearby at Plaza de Cesar Chavez, so traffic and parking is going to be a challenge."

      "text": "There\u2019s no better pulse-pounding three days in downtown than San Jose Jazz Summer Fest weekend, and Friday\u2019s opening night was a perfect example of why. Music just flooded downtown all night \u2014 from the festival stages to the bars and restaurants on South First Street and San Pedro Square.\nThe good vibes started building when Grammy-nominated vocalist Jos\u00e9 James started things off on the Jay Paul Company Main Stage, getting the Plaza de Cesar Chavez crowd energized with his music and a few shoutouts about how much he appreciated being in San Jose. That energy continued through a set by Ghost-Note that followed and and all the way up through the climax of the night, a 90-minute performance by Grammy-winning rapper Common.\n\u201cWhere are my people from San Jose at right now?\u201d asked the multitalented actor and rapper, whose later reference to the intersection of King and Story roads, the heart of San Jose\u2019s lowrider culture, earned another huge response from the crowd. He was joined on stage for his final songs by Bilal, another Grammy-winning vocalist who collaborated with him on the groundbreaking album \u201cLike Water for Chocolate\u201d and who was between two of his own sets Friday night.\nIf there was nothing else happening at the 35th annual festival Friday night, that would have been enough. But there was so much more.\nThe Latin Tropical Stage on Park Avenue is often more quiet on Friday night, but not this year, with an opening set by Andre Cruz and Chris Lujan and a vibrant performance by La Marisoul and the Love Notes Orchestra building up to a crowd-pleasing end to the evening courtesy of Latin rock band Malo. The Malo performance happened the same time as Common was on the main stage, forcing some tough decisions and a lot of foot traffic between the two crowds.\nSan Jose Jazz Executive Director Brendan Rawson said there\u2019s an emphasis this year on the future of jazz, and Friday night\u2019s lineup leaned into the concept.\nStraight-ahead jazz fans packed the upstairs lobby of the California Theatre \u2014 rechristened the California Music Lounge for the weekend \u2014 to hear sets by the Bennett Roth Quartet and Summer Carmago, a 23-year-old trumpet phenom who is the youngest member of the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d band. The stage at the south end of Plaza de Cesar Chavez, which will be filled with blues and New Orleans-style music Saturday and Sunday, was on Friday night given over to artists who would appeal to younger crowds, like Kiefer and DJ Harrison.\nContinuing with that theme, Summer Fest also has its first artist-in-residence this year, trumpet player Theo Croker, who was on the schedule for a solo set Saturday at the intimate SJZ Break Room stage and Sunday at the California Theatre as well as guesting with other performers throughout the weekend.\n\u201cThe character of jazz, the nature of the art form is always striving, always seeking,\u201d Rawson said. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate with a lot of these young artists to be able to give them the format and let them create interesting stuff.\u201d\nThe festival\u2019s Saturday lineup included the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, the John Pizzarelli Trio, Lalah Hathaway, the Pacific Mambo Orchestra, P.J. Morton and a 9:15 p.m. drone show to celebrate the \u201cAlebrijes en San Jose\u201d Mexican art exhibit.\nSunday\u2019s closing day promised a strong finish, too, with acts including the Headhunters, the Mohini Day Quartet, Swing Solution, All Things Swamp, La Do\u00f1a and the legendary Mavis Staples, who will close out the main stage at 6 p.m. The full schedule and tickets are available at summerfest.sanjosejazz.org.\nGETTING PICKLED: Pickleball has found its way to downtown San Jose, as San Jose City Councilmember Michael Mulcahy \u2014 joined by San Jose Parks Director Jon Cicirelli and reps from the Guadalupe River Park Conservancy, the San Jose Sharks and Little Italy \u2014 cut the ribbon Wednesday on a quartet of pickleball courts in Arena Green between SAP Center and Little Italy. When Mulcahy was running for office last year, he and campaign manager Chris Roth saw the potential to turn the park\u2019s tired tennis courts into a venue for the trendy racquet sport.\nAn eight-team tournament followed the ribbon cutting to inaugurate the renovated courts, which are branded with 9-foot by 6-foot versions of the San Jose \u201cplacemark\u201d \u2014 the city\u2019s more dynamic, secondary logo \u2014 which could be visible from planes landing at San Jose Mineta airport. Let me know if you see them when you\u2019re flying in.\nGETTING SAUCED: Speaking of Little Italy, the Boss of the Sauce tomato sauce contest is coming back next weekend for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Aug. 17 tournament will pit eight Italian restaurants against each other, and having from the sound of it, they\u2019re all confident they\u2019ve got the goods.\nJohnny McGrew of Mio Vicino Pasta and Pizzeria says their marinara recipe belonged to the mother of original owner Tommy Caso, who was from Boston\u2019s north end, and was passed down to current head chef Elias Salvador, whose been with them for 33 years. Pino Spatole, owner and chef at Paesano Ristorante in Little Italy says his secret is to use fresh Roma tomatoes, never canned, which are cooked twice \u2014 with a trip through a passatutto (an Italian food mill) in between. Deanna Orkin of Sorelle Italian Bistro says their sauce is all about the family traditions of the mom and three sisters who opened the restaurant 12 years ago.\nThe other contestants include Poor House Bistro, Bibo\u2019s at Littlest Little Italy, Locanda Restaurants and Tony & Alba\u2019s Pizza and Pasta.\nThe splattering starts at noon in the piazza in front of the Little Italy Cultural Center and Museum, with the winner and the People\u2019s Choice Champion expected to be crowned around 4 p.m. You can enjoy the sauces \u2014 and freshly cooked pasta \u2014 for a $25 ticket available at www.littleitalysj.com/events.\nPOLICE REPORT: San Jose Police Chief Paul Joseph expressed a little trepidation speaking to the Rotary Club of San Jose on Wednesday, addressing a crowd that included some city councilmembers and Assistant City Manager Lee Wilcox. \u201cIn case this doesn\u2019t go well, I\u2019m really glad the mayor\u2019s \u2018pay-for-performance\u2019 plan wasn\u2019t enacted,\u201d joked Joseph, who did just fine talking about how the department is using both technology and non-sworn community service officers to help make up for its perpetual understaffing."
