  "description": "There is a catch to this promotion -- OnePlus will only give away 700 smartwatches before supplies run out.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET to learn more about smartphones: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nOnePlus is holding yet another Back to School sales event for its flagship phone, the OnePlus 13. Right now, if you purchase either the 256GB or the 512GB OnePlus 13, you'll receive a free OnePlus Watch 2 (normally $300) in either Radiant Steel (gray) or Black Steel -- your choice. If you don't want the wearable, you can instead receive a Wood Grain Magnetic Half-pack Case for free.\n\nBe aware that the OnePlus Watch 2 gift has a strict 700-unit limit. Once all 700 smartwatches are gone, the company won't be giving any more away during the current promotion. But you can still grab the case.\n\nAlso: As an Android user, this is the closest thing to AirTags for my wallet (and better in some ways)\n\nDon't worry if you miss out on the free smartwatch. A OnePlus representative told us that \"once supplies run out,\" shoppers can enter the code \"BACK2COLLEGE\" at checkout and receive a $100 discount on the OnePlus 13. Adding the code at the time of this writing will not lower the price.\n\nAlthough the code won't work, it is possible to discount the OnePlus 13 through the company's trade-in program. You can trade in any device, in any condition, and receive a nice $100 discount. I should also mention that the deal applies to every color option for the OnePlus 13: Black Eclipse, Midnight Ocean (blue), and Arctic Dawn (white).\n\nThe OnePlus 13 is the company's latest flagship smartphone, and it's a top-notch device -- earning ZDNET's coveted Editors' Choice Award for April 2025. We praised the model \"because it nails all the fundamentals of a great smartphone experience while leading the market in some regards,\" ZDNET's Kerry Wan wrote in his review.\n\nIt features the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a 6,000mAh Silicon NanoStack battery, 80W fast charging, and a high resistance rating of IP69. This means the phone is completely sealed against dust and can survive brief submersion underwater. At a glance, this seems excessive, but according to Wan, \"it's a benefit that users will appreciate when they least expect it\".\n\nPhotography is another area where the OnePlus 13 shines. Its triple-lens system captures bright, highly detailed images, although post-processing can create overly saturated pictures. I also can't forget to mention the stylish design, which flaunts a vegan leather backing that makes the phone visually striking and comfortable.\n\nAs per ZDNET's rating system, I give the base deal a score of 3/5. When I say \"base deal,\" I am only taking into account the free OnePlus Watch 2. Together, the phone and wearable cost $1,200, but this deal shaves off $300. However, if you take advantage of the \"trade in any device, any condition\" program, that score jumps up to a 4/5 since you'll be saving $400 in total.\n\nHow do we rate deals at ZDNET?

Our editors thoroughly review and fact-check every article to ensure that our content meets the highest standards.

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nThere's no doubt about it: the past year has been huge for laptops. But with all these awesome new models, finding the best laptop for you can be tricky. Luckily, our experts tested some of the best laptops of the year, like the latest Lenovo ThinkPad and the light-as-air Asus Zenbook A14. We reviewed spec sheets to evaluate memory and storage, build quality, portability, and value, in addition to testing some of the best affordable laptops.\nUsing industry-standard benchmarking programs, we test all laptops' performance, battery life, and display quality. After going hands-on with dozens of models, we found the best laptop to be the MacBook Pro M4 for its fantastic battery life, fast performance, and sleek, portable form factor.\nBest laptop deals of the week\n- $630 (save $170)\nWhat is the best laptop right now?\nOur pick for the overall best laptop is the M4 MacBook Pro. It has nearly everything you could want in a laptop: a long-lasting battery, top-tier performance, and a vibrant display. It checks off all the boxes and looks as good as it performs, but we're aware it's not for everyone. Our curated list includes a broad range of laptops we're confident will be useful to most everyone.\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)\nThe best laptops of 2025\nWhy we like it: The MacBook Pro M4 checks of all the boxes of what you want in a laptop: impressive performance, a banger display, sleek and portable form factor, and Apple's ever-improving ecosystem of features.\nThe M4 is the latest chipset in Apple's silicon line, with a 10-core central processing unit (CPU) and a 10-core graphics processing unit (GPU). As far as memory goes, you can go up to 32GB with up to 2TB of storage.\nReview: MacBook Pro (M4)\nWho it's for: The vast majority of users will find something to like about the MacBook Pro M4. Whether for photo editing, creative tasks, productivity workflows, or gaming, the M4 does it smoothly, even outperforming the old M1 Pro chip. That's the name of the game here, the M4 is not a massive leap forward from last year's M3; it's a refinement of what already works.\nThe MacBook Pro M4, then, is the culmination of Apple's MacBook device lineup: a joy to use with a brilliant, nano-texture display that supports two external monitors with the lid open, a fantastic video conferencing experience, and a sleek 3.4-pound form factor that set the standard for portability.\nAlso: Best Linux laptops of 2025\nWho should look elsewhere: If you're on a limited budget, the MacBook Pro M4 is going to be a hard sell, as prices start around $1,500 and only go up from there. This is a flagship laptop that can do a little bit of everything, so if you're just looking for something for simple, everyday tasks, you're better off shopping for something under the $1,000 mark.\nMacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) specs: Display size: 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR | Resolution: 3024 x 1964 pixels | RAM: Up to 24GB | Storage: 1TB | CPU: 10-core M4 | Battery life: 16 hours | Weight: 3.4 lbs.\nWhy we like it: The ThinkPad E14 is a dependable, lightweight laptop you can take with you to the office and rely on to handle business for a competitive price point. Armed with an Intel Core 5 125U or 7 155U processor and anywhere from 8GB to 32GB of RAM, you have a device ready for everyday workflows and multitasking across multiple programs and documents.\nWho it's for: If you're looking for a dependable laptop for work with a reliable legacy behind it, Lenovo's ThinkPad lineup is the best place to start. These devices come in a broad range of models and array of configurations, with the E14 being one of the best affordable laptops for work out there.\nStarting at $849, it brings many of the ThinkPad's unique features but keeps the hardware on the modest end, making it a solid workhorse for most workflows and a reliable laptop for teams that don't need high-powered, specialized devices.\nReview: Lenovo ThinkPad E14 (Gen 6)\nWho should look elsewhere: This is an affordable workhorse laptop, so it's not made for intensive visual tasks or gaming. Additionally, although the webcam is standard fare for laptop videoconferencing, the default 720p cam isn't going to win any awards for clarity, so I would elect for the 1080p camera upgrade if you want to look sharp on calls.\nLenovo ThinkPad E14 (Gen 6) specs: Display size: 14-inch | Display type: IPS | Resolution: 1920 x 1200 (WUXGA) | RAM: 8GB-32GB | Storage: Up to 1TB M.2 PCIe SSD | CPU: Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 | GPU: Integrated Intel | Battery life: Up to 10 hours | Weight: 3.17 lbs.\nWhy we like it: HP's EliteBook X G1s is a business laptop through and through, exuding a professional aesthetic while seeking to combine the connectivity of a ThinkPad, the sleek form factor of a MacBook, and HP's signature minimalist, if non-descript, design.\nThere are a few configurations of this laptop, the most premium featuring an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor -- one of the most cutting-edge chips on the market right now -- and an OLED display up to 120Hz refresh rate for a premium, crisp working experience.\nReview: HP EliteBook X G1a\nWho it's for: Anyone seeking a premium work laptop, with special attention to those seeking an ergonomic keyboard that's utterly silent and snappy. During my testing, I found this laptop really enjoyable to use for long days at work, and a big part of that was due to its well-designed ergonomics.\nBut it's not just satisfying to use, this is a powerhouse that's armed for serious multitasking and CPU-heavy workloads. In our testing, we got multi-core performance numbers that approach the MacBook Pro M4.\nWho should look elsewhere: This is an premium laptop with top-tier hardware. If you're just looking for a reliable device for checking emails and working out of a browser, you'll be better off with our previous pick, the Lenovo ThinkPad E14.\nHP EliteBook X G1a specs: Display size: 14-inch Touchscreen | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 2880 x 1800 (2.8K) | RAM: 32GB, 64GB | Storage: 1TB PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD | CPU: AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 | GPU: AMD Radeon 880M | Battery life: Up to 11 hours | Weight: 3.3 lbs.\nWhy we like it: When Asus officially announced the\nHands down, the best part of this laptop is the outstanding battery life, though. Asus advertises up to 32 hours on a single charge. Although that's the top end of the estimation, it's not far off from what you can expect with everyday use.\nReview: Asus Zenbook A14\nWho it's for: It's a sleek and lightweight laptop for the modern professional who lives in the cloud, works remotely, and values aesthetics. In addition, the Zenbook A14 boots quickly, loads apps swiftly, and navigates the web without lag. It runs silent and cool, generating almost no heat -- even with the slim form factor.\nMade of Asus' proprietary ceraluminum material, the Zenbook A14 is exceedingly light, weighing just 2.1 pounds. For reference, the 13-inch MacBook Air is 2.7 pounds. When you set it down, the device opens easily with the lift of a single finger, revealing the brilliant OLED display.\nWho should look elsewhere: This lightweight form and next-gen battery efficiency comes with a tradeoff in the form of raw power. If you need something with beefier hardware for more intensive workloads, check out the HP EliteBook X G1a or the MacBook Air M4.\nAsus Zenbook A14 specs: Display size: 14 inches | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 1920 x 1200 (Full HD+) | RAM: 16GB or 32GB | Storage: 1TB SSD | CPU: Snapdragon X or X Plus | GPU: Qualcomm Adreno | Battery life: Up to 32 hours of video playback | Weight: 2.1 lbs\nWhy we like it: Lenovo's Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 doesn't aim to dazzle you with flashy features. Instead, it focuses on what matters most for a work computer: delivering dependable performance with the flexibility that a 2-in-1 design provides.\nIn that sense, it's a fantastic 2-in-1 that's especially comfortable to use. It features an Intel Core Ultra 5 processor -- a standard midrange chip -- and 16GB of RAM for reliable performance that keeps costs competitive but has enough power for the majority of users.\nReview: Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16\nWho it's for: We recommend this device for anyone who wants to bring a 2-in-1 to the office. It's also a comfortable laptop to use, with a large trackpad and full-sized keyboard with a key travel distance of 1.5mm, enabling fast typing while also reducing hand fatigue. If you like using a stylus, the associated Yoga Pen pairs well with the device's large display, either in tent or tablet mode.\nWho should look elsewhere: Anyone looking for an ultraportable, as this 16-inch device isn't the lightest. Instead, its size and durability make for a stalwart and flexible device for the office.\nLenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 specs: Display size: 16 inches | Display type: IPS Touchscreen | Resolution: 1920 x 1200 (WUXGA) | RAM: 16GB | Storage: 1TB SSD | CPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 Series 2 | GPU: Integrated Intel Arc | Battery life: Up to 17 hours of video playback | Weight: 4.23 lbs\nWhy we like it: Acer's Aspire Go 15 is our pick for best budget laptop. For less than $300, you get a portable notebook built to cover the basics. What it lacks in fancy aesthetics or premium features, this device makes up for it by being a solid secondary computer for students or professionals.\nPowered by an Intel Core i3-N305 and 8GB of RAM, the device can handle lightweight productivity tasks well. Its 15-inch 1080p display provides decent viewing angles and sufficient contrast with a modest level of brightness.\nReview: Acer Aspire Go 15\nWho it's for: Anyone looking for an inexpensive laptop that can do the basics and appreciates the mid-size 15-inch screen. The Aspire Go 15's full-sized keyboard and well-placed trackpad emulate a more premium experience, and its battery life is quite good for the price, lasting over 10 hours during our video playback tests. What's more, the laptop can be versatile thanks to a standard selection of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, and HDMI.\nWho should look elsewhere: Anyone looking for a powerful main driver with future-proofed hardware. While the Aspire Go 15 is fantastic for the price, it's not going to compete with the performance found on the more powerful laptops on this list.\nAlso: Best free antivirus software of 2025\nAcer Aspire Go specs: Display size: 15 inches | Display type: LCD | Resolution: 1920 x 1080| RAM: 8GB | Storage: 128GB UFS | CPU: Intel Core i3-N305 | Battery life: Up to 11 hours | Weight: 3.86 lbs.\nWhy we like it: The Lenovo Legion Pro 7i is the latest gaming laptop in the Legion series, sticking to an accessible 16-inch size but putting all its stat points into the quality of the display and hardware.\nThe result is a sophisticated laptop with dramatic (but fully customizable) RGB lighting, a sleek form factor, and stacked set of hardware designed for high-end gaming. It starts out with 32GB of RAM, (upgradable to 96GB), 2TB of storage, a 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU.\nReview: Lenovo Legion Pro 7i\nWho it's for: The gamer aesthetic is in full effect here, with a dramatic single bar of light across the front of the clamshell that reflects onto the surface and looks absolutely awesome. The display is one of its best features, though. It is bright and vivid and absolutely pops at 500 nits and a 240Hz refresh rate.\nThe Legion Pro 7i is designed to shred through the most demanding titles out there right now, and it's our favorite gaming laptop of the year for its effortless gaming performance.\nWho should look elsewhere: This laptop would be overkill for anyone looking for a portable laptop for everyday tasks or work. The Legion Pro 7i is a large laptop designed for gamers and let's be honest, would look a little out of place in an office.\nLenovo Legion Pro 7i specs: Display size: 16 inches | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 2560 x 1600 (WQXGA) | RAM: 32GB-64GB | Storage: Up to 2TB SSD | CPU: Intel Core Ultra 9 | GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 | Battery life: 6 hours, but varies considerably\nWhy we like it: Asus' ProArt P16 is a highly customizable laptop with a full suite of hardware for creative tasks. It boasts good ergonomics and a sturdy hinge that prevents unnecessary movement, a premium haptic trackpad, and a DialPad that cycles through swatches, brush tools, or slider settings in industry-standard creative apps.\nWho it's for: This is a device for content creators who demand robust hardware to support their work. Powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU and an Nvidia GeForce 4060 GPU, it excels at handling tough workloads like video editing and graphic design. The hardware ensures seamless multitasking, while the 16-inch AMOLED touchscreen delivers vibrant visuals in crisp detail.\nArtists, in particular, will appreciate this display's glossy surface, which responds well to styluses. The Asus DialPad integrated into the trackpads allows users to create customized controls to streamline workflows.\nReview: Asus ProArt P16\nWho should look elsewhere: The ProArt P16 is a good alternative to either the M3 or M4 MacBook Pro, although getting the most out of it requires some optimization. If you're easily overwhelmed by customization options, you might find this laptop to be overkill.\nAlso: Best antivirus software for Windows\nAsus ProArt P16 specs: Display size: 14 inches | Display type: AMOLED Touchscreen | Resolution: 3840 x 2400 (4K) | RAM: 32GB | Storage: Up to 2TB SSD | CPU: AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 | GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 | Battery life: 10 hours, but varies considerably\nWhy we like it: Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 pushes the boundaries of what a Chromebook can do. Armed with up to 16GB of RAM, an OLED display, and a MediaTek Kompanio ARM-based processor (the first such Chromebook of its kind), it's a complete package for the everyday user at a very accessible starting price of $649.\nIt's not just the hardware, either. The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 comes with a few exclusive ChromeOS features not found in any other devices: Smart grouping, which automatically sorts your browser tabs for you, and the ability to edit photos with AI directly out of the Photos app.\nReview: Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14\nWho it's for: Anyone who wants to a premium Chromebook experience for work, play, or anything in between and appreciates a marathon battery. The power-efficient Kompanio processor combined with the lightweight demands of ChromeOS results in a battery that lasts up to 17 hours in our video playback test. In terms of daily use, this is a laptop that will easily last for the entire workday and then some.\nThe Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 earned our Editor's Choice award for its versatility, value, and performance, and set a new standard for what consumers can expect from a Chromebook Plus.\nWho should look elsewhere: Chromebooks come with their own learning curve, and anyone who isn't keen on utilizing the built-in AI-powered features in ChromeOS might be better off with an inexpensive ThinkPad.

First, we acquire data from benchmarking software to analyze a system's metrics under the hood and compare those to advertised numbers. Then, we spend an extended amount of time with the laptop -- usually a week or two -- using it the same way a normal consumer would, to assess its portability, form factor, and how well the battery actually holds up. For an extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive laptop testing methodology.\n- Benchmarking: First, we run a series of tests to put the computer's hardware through the wringer in order to see what it's capable of. Cinebench is one of the most commonly used hardware testing suites, which tests the laptop's rendering performance on single and multiple central processing unit (CPU) cores. PCMark 10 is another powerful program that covers a wide variety of tasks performed in the workplace, and there are many others that we use in tandem to gather as much data as we can. Some components we run tests on include:\n- Processor: The \"brain\" of the laptop and one of the most important factors that determines performance. The four biggest manufacturers that make most of the CPUs found in laptops today are Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple -- in Apple machines only. This is tested in benchmarking software.\n- The display: The size of the display -- measured diagonally from corner to corner -- is also what dictates the laptop's overall size and plays a big role in the device's cost. Brightness is measured in \"nits,\" and color spectrums are tested in benchmarking software.\n- The graphics processor (GPU): Whether it's integrated into the CPU or a dedicated graphics card, how well the machine handles graphics is a key factor when it comes to demanding tasks like video editing, rendering, and of course, gaming. We test the GPU with a combination of benchmarking software, gaming, and media playback.\n- Physical form factor: Finally, the laptop's overall appearance and physical form factor encompasses its weight, thickness, how the keyboard and trackpad feel, and whether it has a display that can be folded back to form a tablet. We carry the laptop around for at least a week and note how well it commutes.\n- Battery testing: We test a unit's battery in a few ways. A handful of benchmarking programs have their own battery testing components, but we also will just let the laptop run for as long as it can under a medium load. We ensure screensavers and hibernation mode are turned off, set the display's brightness and audio at 50%, load up a livestream on YouTube in Chrome, and wait 'til the end.\n- The human element: As we mentioned earlier, metrics and system data is important, but numbers alone don't give you the full picture. This is where we weave in our personal experience with the device and tap into the practical use cases that consumers actually care about.\nUltimately, our goal is to break down the capabilities of each and every laptop we test into digestible terms that real people find useful. There is a lot of noise and confusion when it comes to navigating the laptop and computer consumer market, so we hope to bring an intuitive element to the whole process by leveraging our team's decades of experience.\nWhat are some factors to consider when choosing the best laptops?\nMultiple factors influence the choice of laptops for this list. We look for machines with great designs, performance, and effective storage and RAM. We also considered the different purposes for which you may need or use your laptop and the overall value -- including the price point -- that the laptop promises.\n- Design: Whether your laptop is your ultimate workstation or source of entertainment, its design, display, and portability determine how you interact with the unit.\n- Performance: For many, laptops are essential for workflow and communication. The best laptops promise efficient speed and performance, powered by the greatest and latest chipsets -- like the Apple M4 Max.\n- Storage and RAM: It's likely you'll use a laptop to store key documents or memories, and the best models have plenty of room for you to do so.\n- Purpose: We strive to answer the question, \"What laptop should I get if ___\" as we know you have different workflow and entertainment needs and preferences, from graphic design to gaming.\n- Value: The best laptop can be a pricey investment, so we considered qualities that assure you'll get your money's worth.\nFAQs on laptops\nWhy should you buy a laptop, and not a desktop or a tablet?\nWhile the desktop form factor, especially in the form of all-in-one (AIO) devices, still exists, laptops come in various sizes and cover many use cases. They range from thin, light, and ultraportable to bulky, powerful, and deskbound. Because of how good laptops are nowadays, most people opt for sticking with a laptop to serve as their main computer. If a small laptop screen is an issue, an external monitor can be connected.\nAre refurbished laptops a viable option?\nDefinitely. Despite what the big brands think, not everyone has the budget for a brand new laptop every few years. Purchasing a refurbished laptop will save you some money while also giving life to a perfectly good machine.\nIf you're worried about its performance, don't be. There's a big difference between \"used\" and \"refurbished\", with the latter meaning the device has gone through a quality control check by experts to make sure everything is up to par.\nThat means the hardware has been verified to be in good shape (and replaced, if need be) and the software/operating system are in working order. Just keep in mind that refurbished laptops often come with the hardware they shipped with, so it's not going to be the newest, top-of-the-line components. You'll still get a device that will suit your needs, though, and saving hundreds of dollars in the process.\nOne of the main things to look out for with refurbished laptops is the warranty it comes with. You'll want to make sure you have at least a year of coverage, but preferably more, in case something breaks down or you need a repair.\nYou can purchase a refurbished laptop at reputable resellers like Backmarket and eBay, but the big brands like Dell and Lenovo also have their own refurbished sites, which we highly recommend, as they often put a little more care into their own products.\nWhat are the different kinds of laptops?\nLaptops come in a variety of different form factors these days, with manufacturers playing into the different categories to develop an intended use case. For example, lightweight laptops are made to be carried around, and trade in some raw power for portability. 2-in-1 laptops come with touchscreens that allow for use as a tablet. The best form factor for you reflects how you think you'll use the device.\nLightweight/ultraportable laptops\nMade for students, hybrid workers, and anyone who needs to commute with their laptop. These devices have seen a huge explosion in the past few years, becoming thinner and lighter than ever. Some good examples are the Asus Zenbook A14, the Apple MacBook Air M4, and the Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition -- all devices we've tested and love for their ultraportable forms relative to power and battery life.\nBusiness laptops\nDesigned for the office, these laptops often come with more RAM and local storage, but less powerful GPUs. Their physical designs are often sleek, neutral, and corporate, and they feature lots of ports for compatibility purposes. Premium work laptops may have extra touches like OLED screens (like the HP EliteBook X G1a) or haptic trackpads (Lenovo's ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition) to match the high-end hardware.\n2-in-1 laptops\nAlso called convertibles, these laptops allow for the screen to be folded all the way back so it can act as a tablet or be used in \"tent mode\" to display media. Some 2-in-1 laptops we're big fans of are the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 and the Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1.\nGaming Laptops\nAs the name suggests, these are laptops made to run games, and as such come with the hardware to support that. We're talking high-end GPUs, large, vivid displays, and often, RGB lighting and other physical design effects that set them apart from business laptops.\nWhile they're designed to run the latest titles, they also can double as good machines for creatives thanks to their high-end hardware, and as such, tend to be pricier. Some gaming laptops we love are the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i and the Alienware Area-51m 18.\nMacBooks\nApple's line of MacBooks are premium devices with a host of features that integrate into the Apple ecosystem. The hardware on MacBooks is arguably some of the best in the industry, with things like gorgeous Liquid Retina displays, crisp, clear webcams, and Apple's line of Silicon processors, which have some of the most impressive performance on the market. The trade-off is the cost, which start around the $1,000 mark and go upwards from there.\nChromebooks\nGoogle's Chromebook lineup uses its own operating system -- ChromeOS -- to power its lineup of light and affordable laptops. Putting a streamlined, limited OS onto a laptop with modest hardware means you forgo the sprawling memory demands of Windows, and run 8GB of RAM smoothly and efficiently.\nWe're big fans of Chromebooks at ZDNET, with some of our favorites being the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and the Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE.\nWhich operating system should you choose: Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, or Linux?\nWhile every computing platform has its loyal supporters, most people end up using a particular operating system because of key applications running on it, employer preferences, or budgetary constraints. Windows, which ranges from budget to premium, and Apple's MacOS, which is exclusive to premium devices, cover a broad spectrum. ChromeOS is mostly limited to mid-range devices.\nAlso: For anonymous browsing, these extensions are the next best thing to Tor\nAll Windows devices listed here meet the requirements for Windows 11. If you purchase a device with Windows 10 installed, you will be able to upgrade to Windows 11 if you choose to do so. Note that after October 14, 2025, Windows 10 support will end, and there will be no further security patches or feature updates.\nWhat brand of laptop is best?\nIn general, the leading PC vendors have the most extensive range of offerings and the best-documented track records for product development and customer relations. Therefore, if you do not have a specialized use case or budgetary constraints, you will typically consider vendors such as Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple, or Asus. These vendors currently lead the PC market in terms of shipments, along with several other well-known brands.\nWhat are the best laptops for gaming?\nThe good news is that you don't need to have the biggest, best, newest components to get a decent gaming laptop. To play most triple-A and indie titles, we recommend a rig with at least 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, a 120Hz refresh rate for the display, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card.\nAlso: The best budget gaming laptops you can buy\nAnd if you want to try your hand at content creation, something like the Corsair Voyager a1600 is a sure bet. You might also want to consider equipping with accessories. An Elgato Steam Deck integration, for example, can offer streamlined workflows when editing videos, livestreaming, and even setting up video calls with channel moderators or collaborators.\nWhat are the best laptops for students?\nIt really depends on the student, but there are some common factors to consider when shopping for a laptop for school. You'll want something small and lightweight for easier commutes to and from school and between classes.\nAlso: The best laptops for college: Expert tested\nYou'll also want something with at least eight hours of battery life to get through a typical school day without needing to plug in. This is excellent for younger kids who may be forgetful and leave their charging cable at home. Also, look for a laptop with at least 4GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and cloud-storage backup to create duplicate copies of important files and classwork. You'll also want to avoid laptops with dedicated graphics cards aimed toward gaming to help cut down misuse and procrastination.\nWhat are the best laptops for business?\nWhether you're looking for a single laptop for yourself or a fleet for your business, the best laptops for work offer great performance, multiple connectivity options, and durable builds.\nYou'll want to look for a model with at least 16GB of RAM, a 256GB storage drive, a quad-core CPU, and a display large enough to work on without being too bulky to travel with. You'll also want a model with at least eight hours of battery life to get through a typical day of work without needing to recharge constantly.\nWhat are the best laptops for video editing?\nWe strongly recommend getting an M4 MacBook and purchasing Final Cut Pro, an editing software exclusive to the Mac ecosystem. Buying the 2023 MacBook Pro is another good option. It sports an M2 Max chip and offers great performance for content creators. The machine can handle 4TB of footage with ease.\nReview: The best laptops for video editing: Expert tested\nIf you're looking for a Windows device, we recommend the Asus ProArt P16, our top pick for creators with its vivid display, impressive hardware, and features specifically for creatives like customizable DialPad.\nOther laptops we've tested\nZDNET writer Taylor Clemons also contributed to this list."

But when I tested the OnePlus 13 back in January, that's precisely what happened.\nWhether Google finally launches a Pixel Pro Fold with a flagship camera system this summer, or Apple releases a thinner iPhone in the fall, the OnePlus 13 will likely still be on my mind when the year-end nominations are due.\nAlso: Yes, an Android tablet finally made me reconsider my iPad Pro loyalty\nThere's a lot going for the latest flagship phone, from the more secure (and reliable) ultrasonic fingerprint sensor to the IP69 rating to the 6,000mAh Silicon NanoStack battery. It's also one of the first phones in North America to feature Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which promises improvements to performance, efficiency, and AI workloads.\nI tested the OnePlus 13 alongside my iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL to see exactly how the Android phone stacked up against one of the best phones so far in 2025. In a few ways, the OnePlus 13 falls short, but in many ways, it puts the iPhone and Pixel to shame.\nWhen I first unboxed the OnePlus 13 and held it in my hand, my reaction was audible. Allow me to geek out here: The slightly curved glass, the slimness of the phone, and the overall appearance made my then-four-month-old iPhone look and feel outdated. It's as if OnePlus made the iPhone 17 Air before Apple did.\nHowever, what sells the OnePlus 13 design for me is the new Midnight Ocean (blue) color, which flaunts a vegan-leather backing that makes the phone visually distinctive and more comfortable to hold than its glass-only predecessors.\nAlso: I replaced my Samsung S25 Ultra with the Edge model for three weeks - here's my verdict now\nThe texture isn't as rough and grippy as actual leather, though, so I'd be interested in seeing how it ages over the year. (April 2025 update: The textured backing is holding up well, save for a few dark spots on the corners, likely caused by the phone rubbing against my palms.)\nIf you were hoping the first major Android phone of 2025 would feature Qi2 wireless charging, I have good news and bad news. While the OnePlus 13 doesn't have an in-body Qi2 charging coil, meaning MagSafe (and similar) accessories won't attach directly to the back of the device, OnePlus has embedded magnetic guides within its protective covers, enabling users to take advantage of the accessories so long as the OnePlus 13 is encased. It's a burdenless workaround, but one that hopefully won't be necessary with the next model.\nFor what it's worth, since publishing this review, several other Android phones have been released, including the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Nothing Phone 3a Pro, and Motorola Razr Ultra -- none of which feature Qi2 wireless charging.\nFor years, one aspect that's held OnePlus phones back is the water and dust resistance rating, or lack thereof. With the OnePlus 13, the company is finally taking a stronger stance on the endurance standard, certifying the phone with an IP69 rating. It's a step above the IP68 ratings we commonly see on competing devices, and allows the OnePlus 13 to withstand high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and humidity changes.\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone's cache and make it feel like new\nIn practice, this means the OnePlus 13 can function properly even if you leave it in your washer and dryer, dishwasher, or a pot of boiling soup. The IP69 rating feels very much like a flex, but it's a benefit that users will appreciate when they least expect it.\nPowering the device is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip that, from my months of usage, has some noticeable strengths and weaknesses. For day-to-day usage, such as bouncing between productivity apps, definitely not scrolling through TikTok, and taking photos and videos, the processor handles tasks gracefully. It helps that OxygenOS 15, based on the latest version of Android, has some of the smoothest animations I've seen on a phone.\nAlso: Finally, Bluetooth trackers for Android users that work better than AirTags (and are cheaper)\nBut once you fire up graphics-intensive applications like Adobe Premiere Rush and Honkai Star Rail, you'll notice some stuttering as the higher heat development leads to throttling performance. This isn't a dealbreaker, per se, as the nerfs are only apparent when you're using the device for a prolonged time.\nI've actually been using the OnePlus 13 quite liberally, as the 6,000mAh Silicon NanoStack battery has kept my review unit running for at least a day and a half per charge. That's unseen with any other mainstream phone in the US market, and I fully expect more manufacturers to adopt silicon batteries for their greater energy density. If not that, copy the 80W fast charging or 50W wireless charging; they're quite the revelation.\nOn the camera front, the OnePlus 13, with its triple camera setup (50MP wide, ultrawide, and telephoto), has been a reliable shooter throughout most of my days. While the Sony LYT-808 sensor isn't on par with the one-inch sensors I've tested on international phones like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, it does an excellent job of capturing details and finishing the output vividly. If you're a fan of sharp, bright, and slightly oversaturated imagery (read: more colorful than how the actual subject appears), then the OnePlus 13 will serve you well.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nWhere the camera sensors fall short is in post-processing and AI-tuning features. For example, the phone leans heavily on computational photography to contextualize details when taking far-distance shots. This sometimes leads to images with an artificial, over-smoothing filter. But when the backend software works, it can reproduce details that you probably didn't think you'd capture in the first place.\nBest mobile deals of the week\n- $350 (save $50)\n- $525 (save $125)\n- $300 (save $100)\n- $338 (save $291)\nZDNET's buying advice\nFor a starting price of $999, the OnePlus 13 delivers some seriously good value -- possibly the best of all the major flagship phones I've tested so far this year. The company has improved the device in almost every way, from the design to the performance to its accessory ecosystem.\nI just wish OnePlus offered more extensive software support, as the OnePlus 13 will only receive four years of Android OS updates and six years of security updates. Samsung, Google, and Apple offer at least seven years of OS support. If you can shoulder the shorter promise of longevity, this is one of the easiest phones for me to recommend right now.\nWhy the OnePlus 13 gets an Editors' Choice award\nWe awarded the OnePlus 13 an Editors' Choice because it nails all the fundamentals of a great smartphone experience while leading the market in some regards, such as battery and charging, durability, and design. The specs this year are noticeably improved compared to its predecessor, the OnePlus 12, with a faster processor, lighter build, larger battery capacity, and a more capable camera system. Most importantly, the OnePlus 13 starts at $899, undercutting its closest competitors like the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nThis story was originally published on January 7, 2025, and was updated on July 15, 2025, adding information for a new Prime Day discount."

      "text": "How we rate deals at ZDNET in 2025\nEverything is expensive in 2025.\nWe get it. Tech is perhaps one of the most notoriously pricey categories to shop in, and the prices often climb yearly. That's why ZDNET remains committed to sourcing, contextualizing, and sharing the best deals we come across as experts who know the ins and outs of the industry: when new products drop, when old ones see their first discounts, when the best time arrives to buy the next iPhone, TV model, or laptop, or when your cash has the best ROI.\nTo help readers like you find the best deals on the most popular tech products on your wishlist, ZDNET's team of experts combines detailed testing, a keen eye for savings across trusted retailers, familiarity with product pricing, and over 30 years of authority in the tech space to curate deals on dozens of tech items \u2013 from small accessories to laptops to 98-inch TVs and beyond. We don't just bring the deal to you \u2013 we bring all the information you need to know to make an informed decision about how, when, and where to spend your cash (and, of course, what we think is worth spending it on, too).\nAlso: Google just expanded its shopping tools. Here's how to use them\nWhile we often stand to make a referral fee when you buy from one of our links (like most other tech sites ), we often include prices and offers from retailers where we make $0. That's right -- we want you to feel empowered that you're saving the most and getting all the information you need before you add to the cart (both literally and physically). Your trust means more to us than any affiliate link.\nIf you've ever wondered how we evaluate the discounts, deals, and promotional offers that flood the tech market and choose which ones to share with ZDNET readers like you, here's a breakdown of the various aspects we consider.\nHow we rate deals in 2025\nWhat makes a deal ZDNET recommended?\nWe carefully select the range of products we focus our coverage on, so we can be sure we're bringing you the best deals and the most information on products where we have expertise. ZDNET also only writes about deals we would want to buy (or already have) -- devices and products we desire, need or would recommend. Our experts look for deals that are primarily at least 20% off, hardly ever on sale, or unique for their timing (first-time price drop, lowest of the season offer, etc.) by using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.\nAlso: Google Shopping gets an AI-powered upgrade. Here's how to access it\nWe also read customer reviews to learn what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we recommend. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing, extensive research, and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.\nOur deals methodology\nWe use a percentage-off-based system to initially classify savings offered on top-tech products. This system assigns a predetermined set of savings to a corresponding number (1-5), with one being what we classify as a lower-quality savings offer and five being an excellent offer.\n- 1-9% off: 1 / 5 Editor's deal rating\n- 10-19% off: 2 / 5 Editor's deal rating\n- 20-29% off: 3 / 5 Editor's deal rating\n- 30-39% off: 4 / 5 Editor's deal rating\n- 40-50% (or more) off: 5 / 5 Editor's deal rating\nHowever, this system only provides a base ranking to categorize the offers we share on ZDNET. Our team of experts can choose to promote or demote a deal based on several unique factors, including frequency, brand or product recognition, and our expertise. Here's an example.\nApple products are some of the most coveted on the market, and they don't frequently see sales. Our experts know that the best Apple deals surface on select products during holidays or shopping events like Cyber Week or when newer products are introduced into Apple's repertoire. But you'll still be hard-pressed to find Apple products discounted by 30%, 40%, or more regularly. In these cases, we may choose to label a newly released Apple Watch for 15% off as a 4/5 Editor's deal rating instead of a 2/5 due to the context surrounding the offer.\nSimilarly, our experts may adjust deal ratings based on their curated expertise in the product category, the deal's timing, the availability of the product, and other factors. Our deal rating methodology is not a cut-and-dry approach because there's no easy way to classify savings. But it all comes down to being as helpful as possible to you when you spend your hard-earned money.\nSince deals are often available on a limited-time basis (and can expire at any time), we work hard to ensure we're consistently refreshing our content with the most accurate savings. ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best offers to help you maximize your savings so you can feel as confident in your purchases as we feel in our recommendations. Our experts constantly monitor the deals we feature to keep our stories up-to-date. If you missed out on a deal we've shared, don't worry -- we're always sourcing new savings opportunities at ZDNET.com."

After a few weeks, I returned the device due to its sheer lack of offering anything of value.\nThe original OnePlus Watch was powered by the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), which was perfectly fine, as many smartwatches run lean and mean. However, last year's OnePlus Watch 2 takes things to the next level by offering RTOS and Wear OS 4 on a single watch with a dual-engine architecture. With this unique approach, the device is one of the most efficient Wear OS watches available today, with longer battery life than any other Google Wear OS device or Apple Watch.\nAlso: I recommend OnePlus' lateset flagship phone over the S25 Ultra - here's why\nIn addition to a powerful operating system strategy, OnePlus has created one of the most elegant smartwatches available. The device incorporates stainless steel in the watch body, a 2.5D smooth sapphire crystal watch face, and a durable silicone watch band. The right-side buttons are stylishly incorporated into the bezel, with a round button on top and an oval one on the bottom.\nThe OnePlus Watch 2 is built to meet 5 ATM water resistance and has an IP68 rating, so you can wear it without worrying about swimming and other outdoor adventures. In addition, the device has been built to satisfy MIL-STD-810H standards, so it beats out even the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nOnePlus states the watch will last for 100 hours in Smart Mode, 48 hours with heavy use, and up to 12 days in power-saver mode. It has a 500mAh battery. In my two weeks of testing, I could wear the watch 24/7 and charge it up every three to four days. I wore the device for running and walking with GPS tracking turned on, indoor rowing for active heart-rate tracking, and more.\nThe battery will be consumed faster with the always-on display mode enabled. But as I found the lift-to-wake feature performed well, I kept the always-on display turned off when I first tested it.\nEven though the OnePlus Watch 2 has excellent battery life, it also supports 7.5W VOOC fast charging, so you can charge the device up to 100% in just an hour and get a day of use in a much shorter period. A long battery life with processor efficiency and fast charging are the best combos for a smartwatch.\nAlso: Your Samsung Galaxy Watch is about to get a big upgrade for free - try 4 cool new features now\nDual frequency, L5 and L1, satellite position is present, with support for Beidou, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and QZSS GNSS. The watch tracked me in almost the same way as my dedicated GPS sports watches. And with support for Wear OS, you can use your dedicated watch applications if you don't want to use OHealth. Heart-rate tracking on the watch was also accurate.\nOnePlus requires the use of the OHealth app on your Android phone, and the watch does not work with an Apple iPhone. The Wear OS app is not used, as the watch apps, settings, and health and wellness features are managed through said app.\nThe OHealth app offers a clean user interface, and I prefer using it over the Google and Fitbit apps found on Pixel Watches. At this time, the data collected by the OnePlus Watch 2 remains in OHealth, with OnePlus publicly stating it has future plans to support syncing to other services, such as Strava.\nThe OHealth app and OnePlus Watch 2 support tracking your heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, sleep, workouts, and more. The OHealth app is also used to manage your selected watch faces and the Wear OS tiles that appear when you swipe left and right on the watch face. The OHealth app contains many settings, and I find the software easier to navigate than the Wear OS app on a Pixel phone.\nAlso: Why I recommend this budget OnePlus over competing Android phones - especially at $70 off\nAlso, make sure to check out the extensive number of workout and health settings, which include heart-rate alerts, breathing assessments while you sleep, auto-workout detection, and even customization of the displays for your favorite workouts.\nWhile the OnePlus Watch 2 is a significantly better watch than the first-generation device, there is room for improvement. There is no option for cellular connectivity, the single 47mm diameter with 80 grams of weight isn't the best for people with smaller wrists, there is no support for fall detection, there is no capability to control a OnePlus phone camera from the watch (this is coming in a future update), women's health-tracking features are not present, the watch cannot capture ECG readings, and there is no skin-temperature sensor.\nHowever, I loved wearing this elegant watch and swiping across the face to access my favorite tiles. The Google Pixel Watch is too small for me, and the battery life is too short to enjoy its functionality. The OnePlus Watch 2 shows there is hope for better options at a reasonable price.\nZDNET's buying advice\nAfter testing the first OnePlus Watch, I had little confidence that OnePlus would impress me with another RTOS smartwatch. I was frankly blown away by the work that the company has done to make the OnePlus Watch 2 one of the best watches available for Android smartphone users, while still having room for improvement.\nAt around $230 right now, the device is a must-buy for OnePlus phone owners and a watch that all Android smartphone users should consider. You can also look forward to future software updates that will make this watch an even better investment.\nWhen will this deal expire?\nDeals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. It's possible that this discount will end on June 22 alongside other recent OnePlus deals, although there is a chance it'll continue after the date passes or receive a new offer.\nOur team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we constantly find new chances to save and share them with you on ZDNET.com.\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nCNET: Tariff Pricing Tracker: We're Watching 11 Products You Might Need to Buy\nHeadphones and wearable devices, which are predominantly manufactured in these regions, are now subject to tariffs as high as 54% on Chinese imports and 46% on Vietnamese goods. As a result, consumers may see price increases of approximately 20% on these items.\nManufacturers are exploring options like relocating production to countries with lower tariffs, but such shifts are complex and may not provide immediate relief. In the short term, shoppers should anticipate higher costs for headphones and wearables due to these trade policies.\nLooking for the next best product?

The OnePlus 13 set the tone early, followed by the Galaxy S25 series and, more recently, Apple released the public beta of iOS 26, which introduces a fresh software design. In just a few more weeks, we'll learn more about Google's Pixel 10 series, which is expected to feature a whopping five phone models, so stay tuned.\nFact of the matter is, there are tons of phones shouting for your attention. When you're picking one, really think about what you need day-to-day. The best options on the market feature displays that can beat the outdoor sun, cameras that capture great photos in the most difficult lighting environments, and software features that truly enhance your communication and productivity.\nWhat is the best smartphone right now?\nAfter extensive testing of dozens of devices, our pick for the best phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, thanks to its immersive and vibrant display, reliable battery life, and wealth of special features, some of which are powered by the company's latest generative artificial intelligence (AI) model.\nIt's not cheap at a starting price of $1,299, but our testing found it to be worth the money, especially if you can snag a carrier deal or trade-in promotion. Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max is a close second, with a thinner and larger design, a Camera Control key for precision capturing, and a suite of ever-improving Apple Intelligence features.\nOf course, our pick for the best phone overall may not be the best for you. No matter which option on this list you decide to invest in, expect it to be high-performing, have a display that is bright enough to use outdoors, and have a camera system that will fulfill your photography needs.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nBest phones of 2025\nWhy we like it: The Galaxy S25 Ultra stands out as the premier handset so far in 2025 with its sophisticated integration of Galaxy AI and arsenal of hardware features. The latest Galaxy AI suite brings practical and useful features like real-time call translation, voice commands that work across multiple apps, and photo editing capabilities. Real-world testing suggests these AI functions surpass those on competing Android devices in speed, dependability, and overall usefulness.\nBeyond the AI, the phone has impressed us with its large 6.9-inch, anti-reflective, AMOLED display and robust 5,000mAh battery. Performance is bolstered by the upgraded Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and 12GB of RAM, further enhanced by a larger cooling chamber ideal for multimedia and gaming. The smartphone also excels in durability with its lightweight titanium frame and new resilient Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass.\nFurthermore, the camera system is significantly upgraded with a 50MP ultrawide lens that captures landscape and macro shots with greater detail and vibrancy. We've run several camera tests between the S25 Ultra and competing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and found the Samsung model to deliver the sharpest and vibrant imagery.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nWho it's for: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is primarily targeted towards users who demand the best smartphone experience Samsung can provide and are keen to explore the latest consumer-facing AI features. It represents a particularly compelling upgrade for individuals holding onto three to four-year-old devices, offering significant advancements across the board.\nThe strong build makes it an excellent choice for those who prioritize device protection against everyday mishaps. Multimedia enthusiasts will appreciate the large, anti-reflective, 6.9-inch screen combined with enhanced cooling technology. Additionally, photography lovers looking for improved detail and color in wide-angle and close-up macro shots will find the new 50MP ultrawide camera valuable.\nWho should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's $1,300 price point makes it out of reach for budget-conscious consumers. In addition, users who frequently utilize the S Pen's Bluetooth gestures for actions like remotely triggering the camera may be disappointed, as the functionality has been removed.\nFurthermore, individuals who prefer a less angular or \"boxy\" phone design might find the standard Galaxy S25 or S25 Plus models more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. If you prefer a less bloated software experience, consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL or OnePlus 13, both of which also cost less than the Ultra.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom, 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $1,300\nWhy we like it: The iPhone 16 Pro Max cements its position as Apple's pinnacle smartphone offering over the last year, delivering a comprehensive package for the premium user. Its standout feature is arguably the expansive and brilliant 6.9-inch AMOLED display, ideal for immersive media consumption and mobile productivity alike.\nThe 2024 model introduce a noticeable design change with thinner bezels that enhance the larger screen feel, alongside the addition of the new Camera Control button. This physical switch allows for quick camera access and photo capturing without screen interaction, a feature ZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner suggested \"is going to be super handy for people who take a ton of photos with the iPhone.\"\nThe latest A18 Pro chip drives the phone's performance, which our testing found to yield significantly faster and more efficient on-device AI processing. This is a key capability setting the stage for the various Apple Intelligence tools. This AI suite promises advanced tools like image generation, a more capable Siri, and notification summaries, positioning the 16 Pro Max as Apple's most \"future-proof\" device for the AI era. Camera capabilities are also further enhanced with 4K video recording at 120fps, enabling high-detail slow-motion editing, and Audio Mix technology to isolate and clarify voices in recordings.\nAn improved battery life, rated by Apple for 33 hours of video playback -- up from 29 hours, and newly added support for 25W MagSafe wireless charging round out the significant hardware upgrades.\nReview: iPhone 16 Pro Max\nWho it's for: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is squarely aimed at users demanding the most advanced features and capabilities available within the Apple ecosystem. It represents a compelling choice for individuals eager to explore Apple Intelligence features, which require a more modernized and powerful chipset like the A18 Pro. Photography and videography enthusiasts will find significant value in the new Camera Control button for quick captures, the high-frame-rate 4K video for creative flexibility, and the Audio Mix feature for clearer sound.\nFurthermore, power users who rely heavily on their device throughout the day will appreciate the substantial battery life improvement. The large, high-quality 6.9-inch display makes it ideal for those who consume a lot of video content, play graphics-intensive games, or use their phone extensively for productivity tasks. It's also the go-to for users upgrading from older iPhone models -- particularly pre-Pro Max generations -- seeking the biggest leaps in screen size, performance, and camera tech.\nWho should look elsewhere: The iPhone 16 Pro Max's $1,200 starting price could deter budget-conscious consumers, who might find better value in the standard iPhone 16 models or competitive Android offerings. Users who aren't heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem or prefer the customization and file management flexibility of Android should consider alternatives like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra or Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nAdditionally, individuals who find large phones unwieldy might prefer a smaller device, even within Apple's own lineup.\nAlso: Best password manager for iPhone\niPhone 16 Pro Max tech specs: Processor: A18 Pro | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 48MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 12MP telephoto (2x), 12MP telephoto (5x) | Front camera: 12MP\nWhy we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable phone going into the rest of 2025, thanks to its ultra-thin form factor and market-leading camera system, which captures more lifelike images than competing models from OnePlus and Google, based on our tests.\nSamsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches.\nNaturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the \"inferior\" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nWho it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr.\nThis ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this.\nWho should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead.\nUsers shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 6.5-inch exterior and 8-inch interior | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto | Front cameras: 10MP front | Battery: 4,400mAh | Price: Starting at $1,999\nWhy we like it: The CMF Phone 2 Pro is a top contender for the best cheap phone available today, offering remarkable value at just $279. It distinguishes itself from competitors, even those costing significantly more, with unique design features focused on user control and customization. Among these is the ability to easily swap back covers, attach screw-in accessories like kickstands or wallets, and expand storage via a MicroSD card -- a feature increasingly rare in modern smartphones.\nImpressively, the Phone 2 Pro avoids major compromises on essential specifications often seen at this price point. Our testing found the 3,000-nit OLED display to be notably bright, ensuring comfortable outdoor visibility. This also represents a significant upgrade from the previous model with improved contrast and color reproduction ideal for media.\nThe large 5,000mAh battery delivers solid endurance for most users, enough to comfortably last our reviewers a day of usage. Furthermore, Nothing's streamlined interpretation of Android is a highlight, offering a thoughtful, bloatware-light experience enriched with unique widgets that enhance usability without unnecessary clutter.\nReview: CMF Phone 2 Pro\nWho it's for: This device primarily targets budget-conscious buyers seeking the best possible features and experience without breaking the bank. Its unique customization options, including the swappable backs and accessory system, make it perfect for users who enjoy personalizing their tech. The MicroSD card slot is a major draw for anyone needing ample, affordable storage expansion on top of the base 256GB configuration.\nThe CMF Phone 2 Pro is also an excellent choice for users who prioritize a clean software experience and appreciate the distinctive design elements of Nothing OS. For individuals whose primary phone usage involves browsing, social media, messaging, and media consumption, the bright display, reliable battery life, and adequate performance deliver a satisfying daily experience well beyond what its price tag might suggest.\nWho should look elsewhere: Users who engage in frequent, graphics-intensive gaming or heavy multitasking may find the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro processor underpowered. A device with a stronger chipset would be more suitable.\nWhile the camera system is competent for the price and includes a telephoto lens, its performance in low-light conditions lags behind competitors, making it less ideal for those prioritizing photography in challenging environments. The Google Pixel 9a might be a better fit here.\nMost importantly, potential buyers must be aware of its network limitations. The CMF Phone 2 Pro lacks the necessary band support for use on the Verizon network in the US.. For those needing Verizon compatibility, stronger performance, or better low-light camera capabilities within the budget segment, alternatives like the Motorola Moto G Power 2025 or the Google Pixel 9a should be considered.\nCMF Phone 2 Pro by Nothing tech specs: Display size: 6.77 inches | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 2780 x 1264 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Battery life: 5,000mAh | RAM: 8GB | Storage: 256GB | Rear camera: 50MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto | Front camera: 16MP | Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro | Price: Starting at $279\nWhy we like it: Deciding on the best flip-style foldable phone came down to the wire, with Motorola's Razr Ultra just scraping by Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7. I went hands-on with the new Razr Ultra model earlier this year, and was thoroughly impressed by the improved hinge system (read: the phone feels sturdier to flip open and close), as well as the performance, which is underpinned by an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM.\nMotorola's outer display still supports virtually any app you throw at it, meaning you can browse the web, play games, scroll TikTok, and do other mobile tasks without ever needing to flip open the device. Samsung's platform is more limited in this regard, which always felt like a missed opportunity when testing.\nIt also helps that the Razr Ultra has a textured backing, including new Alcantara and Wood finishes, which I've found to be easier to hold and grip than competing flip phones. Considering how fragile these foldable devices can be -- anything with so many moving parts typically are -- the enhanced grip is easy to appreciate.\nReview: Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)\nWho it's for: At $1,299, the Razr Ultra is not a cheap flip phone by any means. That's why its more affordable siblings, the Razr and Razr Plus exist. But if you want the most complete, durable, and visually-stimulating flip phone on the market right now, you'll have to pay to play with the Razr Ultra.\nI applauded Motorola for exploring new color and material finishes with this year's Razr, and that's something fashion-forward users will likely favor too. The battery on this year's model -- 4,700mAh, up from 4,000mAh -- is also much larger, which you can never really complain about.\nWho should look elsewhere: When buying the Razr Ultra, you should also consider aspects like Motorola's relatively short software update cadence, which ranges from 2 to 3 years, versus Google and Samsung's 7 years. If you're looking for a phone that's even more forgiving when dropped, I'd invest in a traditional slab handset instead, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series or iPhone 16 Pro series.\nMotorola Razr Ultra (2025) tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 4-inch exterior and 7-inch interior | Storage options: 512GB, 1TB | Cameras: 50MP wide, 50MP ultrawide, 32MP front | Battery: 4,700mAh | Price: $1,299\nWhy we like it: The Google Pixel 9 Pro series -- comprising the $800 Pixel 9 Pro and $900 Pro XL -- consistently sets the standard for computational photography in the smartphone market. While flagship cameras from Apple and Samsung are impressive, we've found Google's system frequently excels, particularly demonstrating superior shutter speed for capturing fast action, nuanced post-processing, and natural-looking color accuracy compared to rivals like the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max. This results in photos that are balanced in color and generally satisfying to view.\nBoth Pro models feature the same, highly capable and reliable triple-lens setup -- 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 48MP 5x telephoto -- adept at capturing everything from wide vistas to distant subjects like statues and buildings with clarity. I've taken the Pro XL with me to several product events across the country, and the camera system has been very reliable.\nThis hardware is further enhanced by clever software features like Google's Super Res Zoom --offering usable shots up to 30x, 8K video upscaling, and the more recent \"Add Me\" feature for merging two photos -- perfect for group shots without needing someone else to take the picture. The phones are powered by the latest Tensor G4 chip, which powers features like Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and Best Take, to allow users to effortlessly rescue or creatively enhance nearly any shot, making post-processing incredibly versatile.\nReview: Google Pixel 9 Pro XL\nWho it's for: The Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL are primarily designed for users who prioritize a best-in-class mobile photography experience, valuing reliable point-and-shoot results, accurate color representation, and the ability to cleanly capture challenging, fast-moving subjects. It's the ideal choice for individuals keen on utilizing cutting-edge AI tools to easily edit and perfect their photos after capture.\nValue-conscious buyers looking for flagship camera performance without the absolute top-tier pricing of Apple or Samsung's highest models will find the Pixel 9 Pro series particularly appealing. Furthermore, users who frequently utilize zoom capabilities for distant objects or appreciate the clean software experience and unique AI features synonymous with the Google ecosystem are prime candidates for these devices.\nWho should look elsewhere: Despite its photographic strengths, the Pixel 9 Pro series may not be the perfect fit for everyone. Users whose primary focus is videography, requiring the absolute best image stabilization and motion smoothing capabilities, should consider the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which I still fall back on for recording content. Those who desire the maximum hardware customization, extensive manual camera controls, or specific hardware features like integrated stylus support might find the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra more aligned with their needs.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro tech specs: Processor: Google Tensor G4 | Display size: 6.3 and 6.7 inches | Storage options: 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, and 48MP telephoto | Front camera: 42MP | Battery: 4,700mAh/5,060mAh | Price: Starting at $800 (Pro) and $900 (Pro XL)\nWhy we like it: The OnePlus 13 delivers exceptional performance, class-leading battery life, and remarkable durability, all while maintaining a highly competitive price point. Starting at $900, it offers outstanding value compared to rivals like the $1,000 Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus and $900 Google Pixel 9 Pro, with value further enhanced by potential trade-in offers.\nUnder the hood, it boasts the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, generous RAM configurations up to 16GB, and a stunning 6.82-inch QHD+ LTPO AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and incredible peak brightness up to 4,500 nits.\nIts massive 6,000mAh battery scored high ratings with ZDNET's endurance tests. It's complemented by market-leading 80W wired charging capable of a full charge in under 30-40 minutes and rapid 50W wireless charging.\nDurability is another strength, featuring an impressive IP69 rating for resistance against high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and humidity, along with Ceramic Guard screen protection.\nAdditions like an improved ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, unique design options including vegan leather backs, helpful screen features like Glove Mode, and the signature Alert Slider round out a compelling hardware package supporting a capable triple 50MP camera system.\nReview: OnePlus 13\nWho it's for: The OnePlus 13 is tailor-made for users seeking flagship-level performance, particularly in battery life and charging speeds, without the price tag. Its exceptional endurance and rapid charging make it ideal for heavy users and those always on the go. The robust IP69 rating appeals to individuals needing a phone that can withstand more demanding environments than typical IP68-rated devices.\nPerformance enthusiasts will appreciate the smooth operation driven by the Snapdragon 8 Elite and an ample 16GB of RAM. It's also a great fit for users who prefer a less AI-saturated software experience compared to some competitors, or those who appreciate OnePlus's distinct design philosophy and the tactile convenience of the Alert Slider, though that feature is reportedly being revamped soon.\nWho should look elsewhere: Despite its numerous strengths, the OnePlus 13 may not be the perfect choice for everyone. Users who prioritize purchasing through major U.S. carrier stores might find availability less convenient compared to Samsung or Google devices. While OnePlus offers a solid update policy of four years of OS updates up to Android 19 and six years of security, those seeking longer software support should try Google or Samsung flagships. These often promise seven years.\nAlthough the triple 50MP camera system is highly capable, users demanding the utmost consistency in computational photography, particularly in challenging zoom or low-light scenarios, might still prefer the specialized output from Google Pixel or high-end Samsung models. Additionally, users heavily reliant on MagSafe or Qi2 accessories should note that native magnetic attachment requires a specific OnePlus case.\nOnePlus 13 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display size: 6.8 inches | Storage options: 256GB/512GB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 50MP ultrawide, and 50MP telephoto | Front camera: 32MP | Battery: 6,000mAh | Price: Starting at $900\nTop smartphones compared\nOur pick for the best phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It features everything you could want from a smartphone, including a large display, four cameras that can shoot 200MP photos and 8K video, up to 1TB of storage, a built-in S Pen for writing and drawing, and a 5,000mAh battery powering the system. Here's how the S24 Ultra fares with the rest of our top picks.\nBest phone model | Price | Storage | Screen size | Battery size | Processor |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | $1,300 | Up to 1TB | 6.9 inches | 5,000mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy |\niPhone 16 Pro Max | $1,200 | Up to 1TB | 6.9 inches | 4,323mAh (est.) | A18 Pro Bionic |\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL | $900 | Up to 1TB | 6.7 inches | 5,060mAh | Google Tensor G4 |\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | $2,000 | Up to 1TB | 6.5 inches and 8 inches | 4,400mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite |\nMotorola Razr Ultra | $1,300 | Up to 512GB | 7 inches | 4,700mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite |\nCMF Phone 2 Pro | $279 | Up to 256GB | 6.77 inches | 5,000mAh | MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro 5G |\nOnePlus 13 | $900 | Up to 512GB | 6.8 inches | 6,000mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite |\n*MSRP at the time of writing\nWhich is the right phone for you?\nHaving a list of your must-have smartphone features can go a long way toward narrowing down your options. If you're a mobile professional or travel a lot for work, you'll want to choose a phone that can provide you with at least a full day of use on a full battery and both LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity.\nIf you're looking for your teen's first smartphone, a budget-friendly and less feature-heavy option may be better to prevent overspending and misuse.

The Pixel 9 Pro XL differentiates itself with a slew of AI-powered and the best selfie camera on the market. |\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | The best phone-to-tablet foldable that money can buy today. And if you're a power user, the multitasking and AI features will serve you especially well. |\nMotorola Razr Ultra | A flip-style foldable that's both compact and performant.

The OnePlus 13 is quietly good value, too, starting at $900. |\nAndroid vs iOS: How to decide\nAndroid:\nGoogle's operating system has always been about personalization, app freedom, and flexible use cases. For example, dozens of Android manufacturers launch phones annually, while iOS runs only on Apple's iPhone, which releases two models yearly. Naturally, there are more Android app developers, niche software and services, and form factors that go beyond the glass slab.\nPros:\n- Customization: While the latest iPhone software, iOS 26, is the most customizable version yet, Android is still ahead in modifying settings, looks and appearance, and more. You can adjust settings on a per-app basis, install third-party launchers, icon packs, and other services, and even tweak system animations to make the operating system faster.\n- App variety: According to AppExperts, there are over 3.5 million Android apps on the Google Play Store and more than 1.8 million apps on the iOS App Store. That's a big difference in volume that ultimately impacts users who desire more niche and specific apps for work and play. For example, while both platforms will carry services like WhatsApp and Instagram, Android usually has the upper hand with companion apps for consumer products, unreleased APKs, and more. There's also free access to sideload apps from third-party stores -- that process is exclusive to European users as far as iOS is concerned.\n- Price and availability: Both Android and iOS are offered across the mid-to-high price tiers, but the former goes a step further with options that cater to budget-oriented shoppers. If you're shopping for a smartphone for less than $300, unless you're willing to buy a second-hand iPhone that's already a few generations old, Android handsets are your best option. Android phones also come in foldable form factors, from clamshell-style devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 to book-style ones like the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nCons:\n- Security and privacy: The abundance of Android phones and app makers means there are more opportunities for cybercriminals to access your personal information and/or install malware. How these attacks are prevented and managed also varies across manufacturers, with some OEMs like Google doing a better job than others like Xiaomi.\n- Inconsistency with quality: Like security and privacy, you must always consider which Android maker you're buying a phone from and what it offers across different price ranges. Larger legacy brands like Samsung have a greater reputation for quality assurance and value. In contrast, smaller, newer brands like Nothing and OnePlus must prove themselves, sometimes taking risks that backfire in the process.\niOS:\nThe iPhone's operating system remains one of the most robust and closed in on the market, with unique features that only amplify the Apple hardware experience. Whether you're using an older or newer iPhone, iOS offers superior feature parity across generations than Android, with extended software support being one of its biggest benefits.\nPros:\n- Exclusive, ecosystem-based services: Strength in numbers is the name of the game for iOS, with the operating system notorious for its exclusive apps and services, such as iMessage and FaceTime, which make switching away from the iPhone more difficult than it should be. It helps that Apple has surrounded the iPhone with hardware and software that work harmoniously with iOS, including AirDropping files into a MacBook, pulling health data from an Apple Watch, and, just recently, supporting hearing aid tests via AirPods Pro 2.\n- Quality of apps: Beyond the first-party apps, US developers often spend more time creating and optimizing iOS apps than Android apps due to the percentage of users. Naturally, services like Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok function more fluidly on iOS than on Android.\n- Longevity: When you buy a new iPhone, expect upwards of seven years of software support. While Android makers like Google and Samsung have begun to match Apple's software update policy, the Cupertino tech giant remains the most consistent and reliable, regardless of the model. For reference, Samsung has a better track record of updating its flagship phones than its midrange phones.\nCons:\n- Restrictive experience: Apple has loosened its grip on customizability over the years, with last year's iOS 18 update finally allowing users to freely place apps and widgets anywhere on the home screen grid. However, compared to Android, the iPhone software still has a ways to go. For example, you still can't customize notification types at a per-app level, set navigation gestures beyond swiping from the left side to go back, or download third-party app icons.\n- Poor file management: If you've ever downloaded an image from the web on an iPhone, you'll know just how cumbersome it can be to locate that file later on. Sometimes, downloaded photos and videos will be directed into the file manager app first, requiring further action to fully migrate them into the Photos app.\nFactors to consider when choosing a phone\nThe process of making our phone selections includes real-world testing and researching about the phones for weeks, consulting with colleagues, industry experts, and analysts who also have hands-on experience with the smartphones, and then selecting the best from all of the available choices.\nUltimately, we weigh in the following aspects when curating this list:\n- Design: There's only so much you can do with a slab design, but size differences, material choices, color options, and even the ability to bend a screen in half give shoppers enough diversity to have a preference. That's why we have a recommendation for every form factor.\n- Performance: For many, smartphones are the center of our lives, which means the best ones are performant and can handle most, if not all, tasks you throw at them.\n- Camera: Arguably the most valuable feature of a smartphone; the consistency and reliability of a camera system can make or break the overall mobile experience. We test every device in broad daylight and in the darkest of nights when finalizing this list.\n- Battery: Every option in this guide should last you at least a day of moderate use. We also consider what devices support fast charging and/or wireless charging.\n- Value: Price points are noted, but the most important thing with buying a phone is getting your money's worth. With these picks, you can rest assured that you're getting the best bang for your buck.\nHow we test phones\nZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major phone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and special features. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:\n- Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.\n- Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.\n- Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.\n- Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it -- wired, wireless, or both.\n- Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.\n- Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.\nKerry Wan's smartphone advice\nI've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone right now:\nSpeeding up your smartphone\nSomething I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access, but rules were meant to be broken, right?\nTo turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From within, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from the 1x default setting to .5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.\nOptimizing your battery health\nTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn -- or degrade -- the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.\nWhen in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.\nHow to keep your phone clean\nUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Apple Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at one meter deep.\nOccasionally, take an alcohol pad and give your phone a wipe-down. If you think about it, your phone is just as likely to accumulate germs as your hands, so don't forget to clean it.\nFAQ on smartphones in 2025\nWhen do new phones come out?\nWhile the year just started, we can look at past industry trends to understand when new phones will be released. Below is a list of expected release dates/timeframe for major phones in 2025.\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 series: January\n- OnePlus 13 series: January\n- Apple iPhone 16e: February\n- Google Pixel 9a: March\n- Motorola Razr Ultra: May\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: May\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7: July\n- Google Pixel 10 series: August\n- Apple iPhone 17 series: September\nWhen is the Google Pixel 10 series expected to release?\nGoogle recently confirmed that its next \"Made by Google\" hardware event, which showcases the company's latest Pixel, Nest, and other products, will take place on August 20, 2025 in New York.\nAt this summer's product event, we're expecting the company to debut the new Pixel 10 Series, featuring the standard Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold, alongside new Pixel Watches and earbuds.\nWhat's new with iOS 26?\nIf you're an iPhone user, the upcoming software version, iOS 26, introduces a slew of new features and design changes to be excited about. In fact, if you're open to testing Apple's public beta version, you can sign up for that (with an eligible iPhone model) right now.\nAlso: The iOS 26 public beta is out now - how to install (and which iPhones support it)\nWith iOS 26, the biggest feature is arguably Apple's Liquid Glass design language, which applies a level of transparency and fluidness across buttons, settings menus, and other interfaces. Apple says the new UI is inspired by VisionOS, which powers the brand's XR headset and should invoke a sense of natural motion and smoothness.\nSome more practical iOS features include Hold Assist in the revamped Phone app, more customizations in Messages, a more functional CarPlay experience, and Live Translation across various popular apps.\nWhich phone is best for money?\nBesides the ones listed above, the OnePlus 13R is another great pick for the money. At $600, the device features a large 6.7-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate, a 50MP main camera system, a 6,000mAh battery that beats that of higher-cost devices, and 80W wired charging. The real kicker is OnePlus' aggressive trade-in offer, with the company discounting $100 when you turn in any phone in any condition, effectively bringing the 13R's price down to $500.\nWhich phone has the best camera?\nWhether the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Google Pixel 9 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are the best is debatable. For long-distance shots, Samsung's 200MP rear camera with 100x Space Zoom can capture subjects as far out as the moon. Google's Pixel phones have always been at the top for point-and-shoot pictures and a rather simplified, but effective, camera experience. If you're a videographer at heart, then the iPhone 16 Pro Max, with the ability to record 4K videos at 120 frames per second and a new Camera Control button, is an excellent tool to get the shots you need.\nHow long should a phone battery last?\nThe average phone battery lasts about 22 hours on a full charge, which is great for staying connected on commutes, work flights, and evenings at home. But that's just the average. Actual use time varies by phone model, battery capacity, the power efficiency of its processor, and what you're using your phone for.\nFor example, the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a 32-hour battery life. But you'll get less than that if you habitually scroll through social media or stream video and music.\nHow much storage should my phone have?\nMost smartphones have a base storage capacity of 128GB, which is plenty of space for average users to download apps and music, take photos, and shoot videos. However, if you're a mobile or creative professional, you'll need more space. Many smartphones have expanded storage options up to 512GB or even 1TB, and you can always sync your phone to your preferred cloud storage service to free up local storage space.\nLatest updates\n- In our July update, we replaced the Google Pixel 9 Pro with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 for \"Best foldable Android phone.\" More information has also been added regarding Google's upcoming Pixel hardware event.\n- In our June update, we added information regarding confirmed information regarding the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, as well as replaced the Z Flip 6 for the Motorola Razr Ultra for \"best flip-style foldable phone.\"\n- In our May update, we added information regarding what other phones users can expect later this year, including the Galaxy S25 Edge, Z Flip 7, and Z Fold 7. The CMF Phone 1 has also been replaced by the CMF Phone 2 Pro for \"best cheap phone.\"\n- In our April update, we added information regarding Mobile World Congress (MWC). The OnePlus Open was also replaced by the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for \"best foldable phone.\"\nOther phones we tested\nWhether you're looking to upgrade or get your first smartphone, Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus have great choices that ZDNET's tested and recommends."

Little did I know this would launch me into the world of testing the latest and greatest robot vacuums.\nThese machines have greatly evolved since, from dragging a soggy microfiber pad across your floors to self-washing rotating mop pads, mop rollers, and self-emptying dustbins. All the different options make picking the right product for your needs challenging, but we're here to help.\nWhat is the best robot vacuum mop right now?\nAt ZDNET, we have tested dozens of the best robot vacuum mops available and have seen firsthand that it is possible to sit back and relax while one of these machines takes care of all the hard work. Based on our testing, our pick for the best robot vacuum mop overall is the Roborock Saros 10R, thanks to its outstanding performance, self-empty and self-cleaning features, and oscillating mop pads with extendable capability. Check out the rest of our tested picks for the best robot vacuum mop combos below.\nAlso: Why I recommend this Roborock over competing robot vacuums (and I've tested dozens)\nThe best robot vacuum mops of 2025\nWhy we like it: The Roborock Saros 10R is the best two-in-one robot vacuum mop I've tested thus far. It features an industry-leading 22,000Pa of suction power and dusts the competition. It features a self-emptying dustbin, self-washing mop pads with customizable water temperature, a side-reaching sweeper brush, and an extendable mop pad to reach tight corners. The app has many settings and customizations, from thorough carpet vacuuming to AI-guided cleaning.\nReview: Roborock Saros 10R\nWho it's for: The Roborock Saros 10R is a fairly new robot vacuum and mop that's perfect for anyone looking for the best hands-free cleaning experience. You don't have to worry about manually washing mop pads or constantly refilling water after each cleaning. This robot also has very good obstacle avoidance, so you also don't have to worry about picking up every little cord from your floor before running it.\nWho should look elsewhere: One of its few downsides is that it's priced steeply at $1,600, so it's definitely not the most affordable robot vacuum available. As a premium robot with high-end features, this robot is priced to match.\nRoborock Saros 10R specs: Price: $1,600 | Battery life: 180 mins | Base station dimensions: 15 x 18.7 x 19.21 inches | Suction power: 22,000Pa | Dustbin volume: 270 ml | Water tank capacity: 69 ml\nWhy we like it: The iRobot Roomba Combo i5 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum and mops available right now. It's an older Roomba model, which is why its price has dropped considerably, but it is still available for purchase. This robot features iRobot's signature dual multi-surface rubber brushes, which perform really well on hard floors and carpet. It also has an edge sweeping brush to reach corners and along the edges of furniture and walls.\nWho it's for: This robot vacuum and mop comes with two separate dustbins: one for vacuuming only and another for vacuuming and mopping simultaneously. The dustbins can be easily swapped out, depending on the function you want the robot to operate in at any given time. The robot is one of the most affordable on the market, especially for the technology wrapped within it. It's a perfect choice if you're on a tight budget but don't want to sacrifice quality.\nAlso: iRobot's best Roomba just hit its lowest price ever at almost half off\nWho should look elsewhere: The Roomba Combo i5 requires manual intervention to switch the dustbins, empty them, and fill the mopping one with clean water. You also have to manually wash the mop pad before and after each cleaning. If you'd rather not have to intervene before and after a cleaning session or prefer a robot that can autonomously empty its dustbin and wash its mop pads, you should look elsewhere.\niRobot Roomba Combo i5 tech specs: Price: $199 | Battery life: 180 minutes | Wi-Fi: Yes | Dimensions: 13.4 x 13.5 x 3.6 inches | Suction power: Not specified | Dustbin volume: 360 ml | Water tank capacity: 210 ml\nWhy we like it: The Eufy S1 Pro is an outstanding mop because it uses a roller mop that is scrubbed clean inside the robot as it washes your floors. The robot does this to keep its mop clean and ensure that only clean water is used while mopping, so you never worry about dragging dirty mop pads all over your house.\nThis results in the cleanest floors a robot vacuum and mop has ever left behind in my home. It easily removes dirt and harder-to-clean spots. This mopping system is so advanced that it uses water ozonification to disinfect the clean water you put in the tank. Hence, it truly cleans with the cleanest water possible, though this feature can be turned off.\nReview: Eufy S1 Pro\nWho it's for: The S1 Pro is perfect for consumers with mostly hard floors at home and those who value having their floors freshly mopped. This robot's mopping performance is the closest thing you can get to a manual mopping experience, which is perfect between deeper cleaning sessions. The Eufy S1 Pro's self-washing mop roller is far superior to the traditional microfiber mop pads robot vacuum and mop combinations use.\nWho should look elsewhere: The only thing preventing the Eufy S1 Pro from taking the top spot as the best robot vacuum and mop overall is that the Roborock Saros 10R outperforms its vacuum feature. The Eufy S1 Pro features good obstacle avoidance but is less reliable than the Saros 10R. It can vacuum up larger pieces of paper and debris, and get its brush roller stuck, forcing you to rescue it or risk the cleaning task remaining incomplete. So if you don't want to pick up every cord or toy before each cleaning, you'd benefit from the Saros 10R's obstacle avoidance.\nHowever, the Eufy S1 Pro's obstacle avoidance feature outperforms the Yeedi M12 Pro+ and the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo Complete, other standout robot vacuums and mops on this list.\nEufy S1 Pro features: Price: $1,300 | Battery life: 216 minutes | Wi-Fi: Yes | Dimensions: 18.4 x 15 x 26.4 inches | Suction power: 8,000Pa | Dustbin volume: 250 ml | Water tank capacity: 240 ml\nWhy we like it: The Yeedi M12 Pro+ is a surprisingly affordable robot vacuum and mop. It combines some of the strongest suction power on the market, capable of tackling different floor types in one go, with its mop pads that lift 9mm when going over carpets. The M12 Pro+ has an extendable mop pad to clean areas often missed by robot vacuum and mop combos, like under the edge of cabinets.\nReview: Yeedi M12 Pro+\nAs a midrange robot vacuum and mop, the M12 Pro+ offers great standout features, including a self-emptying dustbin, self-washing mop pads, and a V-shaped roller brush to prevent hair tangles.\nWho it's for: In my testing, this is one of the best-value robot vacuum and mop combos on the market. It's perfect for those looking for a midrange price or to get into the market of self-emptying, self-washing robots without paying a fortune.\nWho should look elsewhere: Because the Yeedi M12 Pro+ costs a fraction of the price of our best pick overall, you'd have to compromise on some of the high-end features that other models offer. While you get autonomous cleaning capabilities, the M12 Pro+ requires you to ensure your floors are clear of debris and obstacles before running it, or it's likely to get stuck.\nYeedi M12 Pro+ tech specs: Price: $400 (limited time deal) | Battery life: 290 minutes | Wi-Fi: Yes | Dimensions: 16 x 19.3 x 18.9 inches | Suction power: 11,000Pa | Dustbin volume: 300 ml | Water tank capacity: 55 ml\nWhy we like it: Thanks to its 8,700Pa suction power, the Ecovacs Deebot X2 can vacuum up hair, dirt, and debris on every flooring type possible. That's not all, though. The Combo Complete variation also has a cordless vacuum that empties itself into the charging dock when you're done using it. Its strong suction and effective mopping kept my floors free of pet hair and muddy paw prints during testing.\nThis Ecovacs robot vacuum and mop is a self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-drying, and self-refilling two-in-one machine, removing all the dirty work from vacuuming and mopping.\nWho it's for: Thanks to the attached handheld vacuum, this robot is perfect for pet owners trying to tackle hair on their floors and furniture. Additionally, if you have furniture that sits lower or chairs that collect a lot of dirt underneath, or kids who are messy eaters, this robot will be for you. Its square design and smaller stature, 12.6 inches wide, mean this robot can fit in more spaces than many competitors.\nReview: Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo Complete\nWho should look elsewhere: Like the vast majority of robot vacuums on the market, this one isn't flawless. While it's fantastic against pet hair, its obstacle avoidance leaves something to be desired. The robot can get its roller brush stuck on random items on your floors, including some charging cords. This doesn't make it a great candidate for homes with younger kids that often leave messes behind, unless you don't mind picking up each one before a cleaning.\nEcovacs Deebot X2 Combo Complete tech specs: Price: $1,700 | Battery life: 161 minutes | Wi-Fi: Yes | Dimensions: 12.6 x 13.8 x 3.7 inches | Suction power: 8,700Pa | Dustbin volume: 300 ml | Water tank capacity: 80 ml| Extra features: Cordless stick vacuum\nWhat is the best robot vacuum mop?\nThe Roborock Saros 10R tops our list thanks to its incredible performance and hands-free technology. The dual oscillating mop heads scrub my floors clean of food, dirt, and paw prints. Coupled with the extendable mop pad technology, everything gets cleaned up when the Saros 10R cleans.\nThis table is a bird's eye view of the best robot vacuum mops to see how they compare:\n| Robot vacuum and mop | ZDNET's take | Price | Suction power | Self-emptying | Self-washing | Battery life |\n| Roborock Saros 10R | Best overall | $1,600 | 22,000Pa | Yes | Yes | 180 mins |\n| iRobot Roomba Combo i5 | Best on a budget | $199 | N/A | No | No | 180 mins |\n| Eufy S1 Pro | Best mop feature | $1,300 | 8,000Pa | Yes | Yes | 216 mins |\n| Yeedi M12 Pro+ | Best midrange | $400 | 11,000Pa | Yes | Yes | 290 mins |\n| Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo Complete | Best for pet owners | $1,700 | 8,700Pa | Yes | Yes | 161 mins |\nWhich is the best robot vacuum mop for you?\nIdentifying the best robot vacuum mop for your needs can be tough when so many options are vying for first place. To help you find the best one, we have included our expert recommendations based on hands-on testing and research.\n| Choose this robot vacuum mop... | If you want... |\n| Roborock Saros 10R | Unbeatable vacuuming and object avoidance, with 22,000Pa of suction and many customization options on the app. |\n| iRobot Roomba Combo i5 | The best performance for the lowest price on the market, especially if you don't mind manual intervention. |\n| Eufy S1 Pro | Truly clean floors that only compare to how well you would mop them if you had the time. |\n| Yeedi M12 Pro+ | To spend a bit less money but still get a hands-free cleaning experience, with a self-emptying dustbin and self-washing mop pads. |\n| Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo Complete | A three-in-one robot vacuum and mop without compromising on efficiency or capabilities plus a cordless stick vacuum. With up to 210 minutes of battery life and 8,700Pa suction power, this is a great option for a bigger home with carpet and hardwood floors. |\nFactors to consider when choosing a robot vacuum mop\nWhile trying to determine the best robot vacuum mops, I kept several factors at the forefront of my testing and research that can also aid in your search.\nFloor types: Some robot vacuum mops are equipped to work with certain floor types, like carpet or hardwood. Others may be able to accommodate other floor types, like stone or marble. Before you buy, consider the types of flooring in your home and which vacuum is most appropriate.\nMapping: For full automation, your robot vacuum mop must have a mapping feature to navigate each room. You also want to consider an obstacle avoidance feature that can avoid things like furniture, wires, and even pet waste. This feature is a must-have in my home with strewn about.\nBattery: A robot vacuum mop is hardly worth it if it doesn't have the battery to keep it going. Consider the battery time before choosing the best robot vacuum mop to ensure it has enough power to clean your home. If you select a robot vacuum with the technical capability to pause its job, return to the charging base to refill its battery, and then resume the job where it left off, this may not be as big of a factor as others on this list.\nConnectivity: Many of the best robot vacuum mops offer voice control, some even with Alexa. Others may feature an app that allows you to control your robot from afar, set schedules, track progress, and control the machine's efforts. If you're hoping for voice activation rather than using an app, check and see if the machine is compatible with the home assistant of your choice.\nHow we test robot vacuum mops\nZDNET has several robot vacuum reviewers that have tested over 50 units thus far. We conduct tests in real homes with real challenges and in a controlled lab environment for comparison.\nHere's what we consider when testing robot vacuums and mops at ZDNET:\n- Determine evaluation criteria: For our key evaluation criteria, we consider how robots perform by assessing their suction power, navigation, mapping, and battery life. We also assess the user experience, the robot's versatility, longevity, and whether it delivers on its specifications.\n- Unboxing: During this process, we assess the packaging and setup experience and note any accessories and unique features.\n- Testing environments: We test the robot vacuums on different floor types (like carpet and hardwood) and see how they navigate various obstacles to test performance.\n- Performance metrics: We test suction power with various debris types and assess obstacle navigation and mapping accuracy.\n- Extra features: When testing robot vacuum and mop combinations, we evaluate their effectiveness at removing stains and overall cleaning quality. We also check how unique features work, like obstacle avoidance and recognition, extendable mop pads, etc.\nTo top it all off, we gauge the device's longevity and long-term performance by using it over the course of a few months.

These services route traffic through their server network, assigning users new IP locations and preventing tracking, targeted advertising, and data theft. They're often useful in accessing geo-locked streaming libraries, can help protect you while you travel. In recent weeks, VPN downloads have surged in response to U.K. censorship laws that block websites without age verification checks.\nVPNs are not a silver bullet for security, but the best VPN services will protect your privacy without significantly impacting your speed or browser sessions. They may also offer additional privacy features, including ad-blocking, phishing domain detection, data breach scanners, and password managers.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nWhat is the best VPN service right now?\nMy pick for the best overall VPN is NordVPN. Based in Panama and subject to strict data protection laws, NordVPN is a top contender in the VPN space. NordVPN offers the full package -- fast speeds, stable connections, an expansive server network, and excellent streaming capabilities. It's not the cheapest VPN, starting at $3.09 per month, but if you want a solid, versatile VPN backed by solid customer support, NordVPN is for you.\nMy second choice is ExpressVPN, a secure and user-friendly VPN that offers some of the best speeds available. Expect to pay $5 month on a two-year plan, although you also receive four months of free service on signup.\nAlso: The best VPNs for streaming: Expert tested\nThe ZDNET team has decades of experience in the VPN arena. I've tested all the best VPNs on the market, rigorously evaluating them through frequent speed tests and ranking them based on the number of servers, security features, price, and more. If you're interested in signing up for a VPN, pick a trustworthy service that doesn't vastly impact your speed or internet connection. You should also consider the size and variety of its server network and how the VPN provider treats user data.\nRead on to find the best VPN for you in 2025.\nThe best VPNs of 2025\nNordVPN is one of the most widely used VPNs, and for most users, it ticks all the boxes. It's secure, fast, suitable for streaming, and has all the features you'll likely need.\nWhy we like it: NordVPN is fine for basic use but offers many features beyond a mere VPN tunnel, including support for peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and an optional second layer of encryption through Double VPN. This allows you to set up a dedicated IP address to run a VPN that also acts as a server.\nI've found it to be one of the fastest VPNs with the most consistent speed measurements and rapid initial server connectivity. It's still worth noting that rival ExpressVPN is slightly faster.\nIn my tests with Netflix, NordVPN emerged as a top VPN for streaming content with a high success rate in accessing geo-blocked content. When set up with the Privacy Hero 2 router, it also did exceptionally well in accessing streaming services worldwide.\nThis year, the company launched\nNordVPN also features a kill switch that activates if your connection suddenly drops, protecting your connection and data and a handy pause function. In its fifth independent\nReview: NordVPN: Consistent speed and performance\nWho it's for: Those who want the best overall VPN around. It's a solid, fast VPN to use across different devices, and for a relatively affordable price. NordVPN is compatible with all major platforms and provides a server network of 111 countries, and it allows you to connect 10 devices simultaneously under one account. It's also excellent for streaming.\nWho should look elsewhere: NordVPN will suit most users' needs, but if you want speed first, ExpressVPN might be the right alternative.\nYou can pick between three types of plans with two-year, one-year, or one-month contract terms, depending on whether you want advanced features such as a password manager, data breach scanner, cloud storage, or file encryption.\nPrices start at $3.09 per month on a two-year plan or $5 per month for a one-year subscription. Three months of free access are included with two-year contracts.\nAlternatively, you can try out NordVPN for a month and take advantage of the organization's 30-day money-back guarantee.\nNordVPN features: Simultaneous connections: 10 | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, tvOS, and routers | Countries: 111 | Kill switch: Yes | Logging: Email address and billing information only | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android | Trustpilot rating: 4.2 | Google Play rating: 4.6 | App Store rating: 4.7\nExpressVPN is my top choice for the fastest VPN service around.\nWhy we like it: Customers say it delivers a speedy and consistent connection, and I agree. NordVPN and ExpressVPN are well-matched in terms of speed, but ExpressVPN often outperforms its closest competitor in the speed tests I conduct every few months.\nIt's one of the most popular VPN providers, offering a wide range of platforms, and is well-regarded and trusted. The service also has an expansive network with servers in 105 countries and has recently\nIn total, eight simultaneous connections can be linked under a single account. I think this number of connections is restrictive, considering the higher price point of this VPN compared to many of its competitors.\nCompatible platforms include Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Fire OS, and tvOS. The service also works with Linux, which has been\nReview: ExpressVPN: Is it worth the price?\nThe company doesn't log your browsing history, IP address, or traffic destination and operates a no-logs policy. In ExpressVPN's latest transparency\nWhile customer service is friendly and polite, they persist in customer retention, so you'll need to set aside some time if you wish to cancel after the 30-day period.\nWho it's for: Individuals who see speed as king. This VPN has consistently secured the top spot in my speed tests over the past few years.\nExpressVPN is also the developer of Aircove, a router product line with ExpressVPN built in, saving you the legwork if you want blanket coverage for all your home devices. Alternatively, you can manually set up ExpressVPN to work with gaming consoles and TVs that do not natively support VPN apps, but you may need to install the VPN directly on your router.\nWho should look elsewhere: VPN customers who want a budget-friendly option should consider Surfshark or another of my recommended VPNs. Considering the high price point of the subscriptions, I would eventually like to see ExpressVPN support unlimited simultaneous connections instead of just eight.\nNew users can subscribe to ExpressVPN's two-year plans for $5 per month with four months of free service added to the length of the contract. Alternatively, if you opt for $6.67 per month, you will receive one year of access with three months free.\nThere is a 30-day money-back guarantee. ExpressVPN now also accepts Google Pay and Apple Pay.\nExpressVPN features: Simultaneous connections: 8 | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Linux, Fire TV, Android TV, tvOS, and routers | Countries: 105 | Logging: No browsing logs, some connection logs | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android and iOS | Trustpilot rating: 4.1 | Google Play rating: 4.7 | App Store rating: 4.7\nSurfshark should be on your radar if you are looking for an affordable, secure VPN.\nWhy we like it: In ZDNET's Surfshark VPN review and testing, we found that this VPN offers reasonable speeds and a decent server network. I've also found that it's not the fastest option or the quickest to initially connect, but the cheap price point provides excellent value for money.\nThere were also no data leaks, which is precisely what you want to see from a quality VPN.\nWith a server network spanning 100 countries, you have plenty of locations to choose from, making this VPN a good choice for streaming content at home or abroad.\nSurfshark prioritizes security with AES-256-GCM, Perfect Forward Secrecy, and RSA-2048 encryption. The organization also upholds a no-logs policy, although this was last audited in 2023.\nAlso: NordVPN vs Surfshark: Which is better?\nWe like its add-on features, such as anti-tracking, a search engine that doesn't log your information, and a scanner that searches data breach lists for your email. With Surfshark's multi-hop option, you can also connect through two VPN servers. Customers praise the support team for being excellent and quick to respond.\nWho it's for: Anyone on the hunt for a consistently affordable VPN without any unwelcome price hikes. The cheapest option, a two-year subscription called Surfshark Starter, costs only $2 per month.\nAlternatively, you can sign up for one year and pay $3.19 per month or $15.45 for just one month of access. One- and two-year contracts include three months of free access and a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nWho should look elsewhere: Surfshark provides excellent value for money, but it isn't the fastest or the most advanced VPN. If you want rapid speeds, a larger server network, or advanced customization, check out my other recommendations, including NordVPN and ExpressVPN.\nSurfshark features: Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Ad-blocker | Two-factor authentication | Kill switch: Yes | Countries: 100 | Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Fire TV, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, tvOS, and routers | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android, iOS, and macOS | Trustpilot rating: 4.5 | Google Play rating: 4.7 | App Store rating: 4.7\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA) is an open source VPN solution with a solid security background.\nWhy we like it: Private Internet Access is an excellent option if you need a VPN long-term and support for multiple devices. The service offers unlimited simultaneous connections, is compatible with various operating systems and devices, and also includes a free email breach monitor\nReview: Private Internet Access\nPIA's network isn't the largest, with only 91 country options available, but customers note that the VPN is quick to install and simple to use. However, my testing found that server upload speeds can be slow.\nOther features I like are the \"snooze\" button if you need to temporarily turn off the VPN, and a tab displaying security elements, including port connections, protocols, and data encryption standards in use. You can also opt for a dedicated IP address or an antivirus scanner as a part of your package.\nWho it's for: PIA offers excellent security, given that it's open source, and so security-conscious individuals should consider it. Much of the VPN's code can be examined and audited publicly, which is always desirable when trusting your security to a third-party vendor.\nA strict no-logs policy also exists, and PIA publishes frequent transparency reports. In its latest\nWho should look elsewhere: If streaming, speed, or a large server network are more important than open source technologies, consider another option.\nIf you would like to give it a try, Private Internet Access offers two plans, including a two-year subscription for $2.19 per month, making it a very affordable VPN. The best deal is the two-year subscription, as you also get two months of free access.\nIf you want to try out the VPN for a shorter period, you can sign up for $7.50 per month for six months.\nPrivate Internet Access VPN features: Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, tvOS, routers, Fire TV, and NAS | Countries: 91 | Logging: No-logs policy | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android and iOS | Trustpilot rating: 4.3 | Google Play rating: 4.5 | App Store rating: 4.7\nProton is a Swiss company that adheres to the country's strict privacy laws and also provides a free VPN service.\nWhy we like it: Under the slogan \"privacy by default,\" this organization is focused on developing services -- including encrypted email and a VPN -- to enhance the privacy of activists, journalists, and the public.\nProton VPN takes a solid approach to security, layering robust protocols on top of perfect forward secrecy and encryption. Not only does Proton VPN have a kill switch, but it also provides torrenting support, WireGuard, and an ad-blocker.\nAll of Proton's apps are open-source, there's a no-logs policy, and the company reports that it is independently audited. The firm has also created its own protocol,\nAmong its other services is the NetShield ad-blocker, which has been recently\nCustomers like Proton's attitude to security and privacy. I find it easy to use, and the speeds are reasonable. Although Trustpilot ratings are low, the feedback primarily relates to the firm's free plan limits and customer support system.\nThere are free and paid options available, and if you need a free solution, this is one of the few trusted VPNs I recommend.\nReview: Proton VPN\nWho it's for: Proton offers a free VPN service that is supported by paid users. It allows one machine to connect without bandwidth limits and provides access to servers across five countries.\nI don't typically recommend using free VPNs, but if you want a service for casual browsing, you should consider this one. Unlike many less reputable free VPN services, it will not sell your information -- but considering there are server and location restrictions for free accounts, you may not experience the true speeds of the overall network.\nWho should look elsewhere: Anyone who wants more than a restricted, albeit free, service should consider another option or check out Proton VPN's paid offerings.\nIf you want access to Proton VPN's full server network of 117 countries and over\nThe best deal is $3.59 per month on a two-year plan. A one-year plan is priced at $4 per month, or you can opt for one month of access for $10. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nProton VPN features: Open-source | Simultaneous connections: One to 10, depending on the plan | Countries: 117 | Logging: No-logs policy | Security audits | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, Kodi, and routers | VPN accelerator | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Free option | Trustpilot rating: 2.8 | Google Play rating: 4.8 | App Store rating: 4.6\nBest VPNs, compared\nBest VPN service | Price | Kill switch | Countries | Simultaneous connections |\nNordVPN | $3.09 per month on a two-year plan | Yes | 111 | 10 |\nExpressVPN | $5 per month on a two-year plan | Yes | 105 | 8 |\nSurfshark VPN | $2 per month on a two-year plan | Yes | 100 | Unlimited |\nPrivate Internet Access | $2.03 per month on a two-year plan | Yes | 91 | Unlimited |\nProton VPN | Free or $3.59 per month on a two-year contract | Yes | 117 | 1-10, varies by plan |\nHow do I test the best VPNs?\nI ran a series of speed and connectivity tests in July 2025 on each VPN's paid service to see how they compare.\nI performed the tests using a broadband connection in the U.K. with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of 59.3 Mbps download and 17.2 Mbps upload. (Yes, they are terrible, but they are the best the U.K. currently offers where I live.) I also tested for the presence of domain name service (DNS) leaks.\nPlease remember that results may differ for you and vary from country to country, so the below should be considered a snapshot. Your internet service provider (ISP) and broadband subscription may also impact your speeds. For example, the starting speed is a snail's pace compared to some U.S. offerings.\nThe below results are not the exact speeds you should expect. You can instead use these results to get a general idea of how your speeds could change with a VPN. Remember that the further away the VPN server, the more your speed may be impacted. Speeds will typically be quicker when you connect to a local server, compared to selecting Australia, for example, unless you're in Australia.\nWhich is the right VPN for you?\nChoose this top VPN service... | If you want... |\nNordVPN | The best VPN overall. NordVPN is one of the most consistently fast and stable VPN providers with a solid and large server network, giving you plenty of countries to connect to. It's great for streaming and travel, too, with a stylish user interface on PC and mobile. |\nExpressVPN | One of the fastest VPNs with a large server network. I've used ExpressVPN for years, and I consider it one of the fastest and least obtrusive services available. You can expect multi-platform support and relatively minor speed downgrades when you are streaming. However, it isn't cheap. |\nSurfshark VPN | The least expensive top VPN based on my testing. Surfshark is a consistent entrant in my top VPN lists, and for good reason. It might not always be the fastest, but for the price point, you can't argue against its value for money. It's also perfect for beginners. |\nPrivate Internet Access | Unlimited simultaneous connections. Private Internet Access is a great choice if you want a set-and-forget, affordable VPN, but the interface won't suit everyone. Still, this VPN will support and protect as many devices as you like under one account, including your PC, smartphone, and even your smart TV. |\nProton VPN | A variety of add-on features and the comfort of open-source security. Proton VPN is one of the most privacy-focused VPN services out there. It offers reasonable speeds and is one of the few trusted providers out there that also provides users with a free plan. |\nFactors to consider when choosing a VPN service\nThese are the most important factors to consider when selecting a new VPN service.\n- Speed: Every VPN performs differently, and every user experience differs. Your ISP will offer speeds that are not the same as someone in another location. Your favorite coffee shop has a different network connection than our local haunts. So, when you are testing a new VPN, keep your base speed in mind. Look out for VPN solutions with minimal speed loss.\n- Apps: VPN providers should offer compatibility for multiple platforms and operating systems. Take a look at the user interfaces, features, and compatibility offered by your chosen VPN provider before you commit.\n- Simultaneous connections: If you're paying for a VPN, you might want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC, smartphone, or smart TV. We recommend you sign up for a plan supporting at least six devices, and thankfully, most paid plans now offer at least this number.\n- Trial periods: Before committing to a VPN provider, test them out -- that's what money-back guarantees are for. Remember that most VPN providers will give you 30 days to cancel and secure a refund. Some even offer up to 45 days.\n- Free VPN providers: Running a VPN is expensive, and if the VPN provider doesn't make money from your service fees, they're going to make money from your data -- sometimes even by selling your personal information. Stick with the trusted commercial vendors we've tested or the handful of free plans we recommend. There are also cases where \"free\" VPNs undermine what the software is designed for -- data protection and security.\n- Contract terms: VPN providers constantly offer discounts, typically on longer-term plans, so you need to consider the fine print before you sign up. Remember to cancel before automatic renewal if you're no longer happy with the service or want to switch to a cheaper deal elsewhere.\n- Use cases: Your VPN selection should relate to how you want to use a VPN. For example, you may want one specifically for streaming geo-locked content, or you may need a VPN that is likely to work in restricted countries. Consider these points before making your final choice and test them out during your money-back-guarantee time period to ensure the VPN is right for you.\n- Advanced features: You might like the idea of bundling your new VPN with antivirus software, a data breach alert tool, or a password manager. Check out the advanced features offered under different plans to make the right choice.\nHow to use a VPN\nIf you're interested in using a VPN, setting up the service will depend on the VPN provider, your contract, and the devices you want to protect. To set up a VPN, you will first need to subscribe to a VPN service and download the VPN software. You can visit the VPN service's official website, or you may receive a download link through email. Alternatively, visit Google Play or the App Store for mobile app options.\nOpen the software, provide any associated permissions the VPN needs, and sign in using your credentials.\nChoose a server location and connect to the VPN. In this example, you can select ExpressVPN's \"...\" button to select a server from its list of countries. Most VPNs will give you a \"smart\" location set as default, typically close to home.\nAlso: Best VPNs for Smart TVs\nIt's that simple! Of course, you can check out your VPN's settings and tailor your experience to your liking. However, for many users, sticking to default options and having a few favorite servers will be enough.\nHow I test VPNs\nI tested and analyzed the best VPNs in 2025 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision:\n- Performance: My top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags. I frequently conduct speed tests to stay up to date and informed of any service changes.\n- Simultaneous connections: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV, and want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least six simultaneous connections.\n- Security: A VPN's security protocols and encryption levels must stay up to scratch. I want a recommended VPN's development team to prioritize security improvements over time and promptly address reported bugs, and I look for evidence of transparency around security updates.\n- Kill switch: A kill switch prevents you from using an unprotected connection. This is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop. All of my recommended VPNs provide this feature.\n- Geo-blocks and streaming: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. I ensured that our top recommendations perform well given these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming.\n- Platforms: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? My VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive desktop software for at least Windows and macOS, alongside mobile apps.\n- Countries and servers: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.\n- Trial length and price: Each VPN I recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days, and many will offer mobile users a seven-day trial.\nSupport: As with any subscription software, you may encounter problems installing apps, using the service, renewing, or canceling. I list VPNs with a support team available, although the communication channels on offer may vary.\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out ZDNET's comprehensive VPN testing methodology page.\nLatest news\n- A free VPN extension is reportedly taking screenshots of user activity, including the websites they visit.\n- The U.K.'s new and controversial Online Safety Act sparked a surge in VPN downloads.\n- BulletVPN closed its doors, leaving some lifetime subscribers out in the cold. Windscribe stepped in to offer some users a complimentary six-month subscription.\n- A free \"VPN\" hosted on GitHub was unmasked as information-stealing malware.\n- Roskomnadzor, Russia's federal media agency and regulator, sent a wave of VPN takedown requests to Google in an apparent effort to wage war against VPN use in the country.\n- VPNs were formally deemed a \"key challenge\" to investigative work and law enforcement agencies by the EU's HLG (High Level Group).\nIs VPN software impacted by tariffs?\nRecent tariff changes have not directly impacted Virtual Private Network software. Software is rarely considered in tariff alterations, and so subscription services should be safe, for now.\nHowever, this doesn't mean the industry as a whole will not be impacted, as associated hardware -- such as servers and networking equipment -- could be subject to higher costs, and this may be passed on to consumers.\nLatest updates\n- August 2025: In ZDNET's August update, we performed editorial changes, updated the latest news on VPNs, and added additional information on our top picks and alternatives.\n- July 2025: In ZDNET's July update, we performed new speed tests, updated our rankings and pricing information, and performed copy changes.\n- April 2025: In our April update, we retested every VPN we recommend and conducted new speed tests, alongside a series of streaming library access checks.\n- May 2025: In our May update, we performed copy improvements and refreshed pricing and deals.\nFAQs on VPNs\nWhat is a VPN?\nVPN, short for virtual private network, lets you browse the internet privately and connect securely to open or public Wi-Fi networks. A VPN allows you to change your virtual location by redirecting the connection through one of its servers worldwide. A VPN encrypts your traffic, hiding you from hackers, internet service providers, and governments.\nIf your online activities are being monitored at the internet service provider (ISP) level -- say, by a government -- they may recognize the signature of a VPN, even if exactly what you are doing is hidden.\nVPNs are useful in unblocking geo-restricted content and can be vital tools for accessing information in countries with repressive governments. They are important services for anyone who wants to maintain a high level of safety and privacy online. Because they are anonymous -- or at least should be -- they can also be used to hide illegal online activities, such as pirating content.\nHow can I tell if my VPN is working or not?\nA fully functional VPN should protect your privacy and mask your location and IP address. If you're unsure if your VPN is working correctly, there are tools that make checking your service's performance easy.\nYou can find out your IP address and location by using whatismyipaddress.com. Compare the IP address and location when you're connected with and without a VPN. If they are different, then your VPN is doing its job.\nIt's possible that your VPN is leaking your data and potentially exposing your online activity. You can run tests on a site like DNS Leak Test to ensure your VPN has no issues with domain name service (DNS) leaks or IP leaks. Plenty of tools allow you to test for leaks, but VPN providers own many, and it may not always be clear who developed the tool, which could be a conflict of interest. You may want to run tests using different sites and compare the results.\nDo I need a VPN if I'm traveling or using a Wi-Fi hotspot?\nNative VPN support on Mac\nIf you're connecting to an existing corporate virtual private network, you may not need an additional service. MacOS comes with built-in native VPN support, although most consumers won't need to adjust these settings.\nIf you do, head over to System Settings, then the Network tab, and either import the configuration file you were provided or hit the plus button and add a VPN interface. Here's a handy tip sheet from Apple that will walk you through the process.\nNative VPN support on Windows\nIf you're connecting to an established corporate VPN, all you need to do is add a new Windows VPN connection. Click the Start button, type settings, then select Settings, Network and Internet, VPN, and then Add VPN. Make sure you have the connection details provided by your work, and then click on \"Add a New VPN Connection.\" Fill in the form and you're good to go. Here's a tip sheet from Microsoft with more information.\nWindows also allows you to host a VPN server by creating a new incoming network connection, choosing the users who can connect, and telling Windows that the incoming connection is across the internet. You'll also have to configure your router to allow traffic to your computer.\nNative VPN support on ChromeOS\nIf you're using a Chromebook, all you need to do is open Settings, Network, Add Connection, and then choose between OpenVPN and L2TP over IPSec. Google has a handy cheat sheet to guide you through the process.\nSee also: The best VPN extensions for Chrome - expert tested\nLinux with WireGuard\nWireGuard is Linux's baked-in VPN capability. Its code is relatively simple and small, making it far easier to maintain, test, and debug.\nMost VPNs we spotlighted support WireGuard right out of the box. You can download it for Linux. You can also download a package for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and FreeBSD. It's like most open-source products in that you'll need to do some reading and thinking to make it work.\nCan I use a VPN with Apple TV?\nApple announced support for third-party VPNs on tvOS in 2023. Since then, many top VPN providers have developed native apps for tvOS. VPNs with native Apple TV support include ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and Surfshark.\nCheck out our guide below for the best tvOS-supporting VPN options in the market today.\nSee also: The best Apple TV VPNs: Expert tested\nDo I need a VPN for my smart TV?\nIt probably isn't worth it to invest in a VPN purely for use with your TV. You'll find that only some TV operating systems natively support VPN apps, whereas others -- such as Tizen -- do not, which means you will have to find a workaround, such as installing a VPN on your router or Amazon TV Firestick.\nThat said, if you want to use a VPN to access different streaming service libraries, a VPN provides the means to do so. This is a legally gray area, and you may only be able to access universally licensed content if VPN use is detected.\nWhat's the best free VPN service?\nI've highlighted paid services in this article, although some offer a free tier or a money-back guarantee during a trial period. For more, check out my picks for the best VPN free trials. In general, I don't recommend most entirely free VPN services because they may not be secure.\nOperating a good VPN service requires hundreds of servers worldwide and vast networking resources. If you're not paying to support that infrastructure, who is? Probably advertisers or data miners. If you use a free service, your data will probably be sold. You wouldn't want your data to go to some company to sift through, it completely defeats the purpose of a VPN.\nBefore you choose a VPN service, free or paid, know that no single tool can guarantee your privacy. Anything can be compromised. A VPN protects your data from your computer to the VPN service. It doesn't protect what you put on servers. It doesn't protect your data from the VPN provider's VPN servers to whatever site or cloud-based application you use. Privacy and security require you to be diligent throughout your digital journey, and VPNs, while helpful, are not a miracle cure.\nThat said, if you would like to explore free options, I have compiled a guide of the best free VPNs available.\nHow much does a VPN cost?\nA VPN's cost can vary depending on your needs. Basic plans often cost a few dollars per month, but pricing structures are often displayed as monthly equivalents, so you may have to pay upfront for the full contract at sign-up. Tax may also be added. If you need a specialized VPN, such as one able to circumvent blocks in countries like China, expect to pay more. Overall, expect to pay between $2 - $10 per month.\nWhy are month-to-month VPN plans so expensive?\nIn my opinion, VPN providers usually set extortionate pricing on one-month subscriptions to deter customers from opting for these plans.\nWhile most VPNs are available month-to-month, they are usually priced at over $10 per month and aren't great value compared to one-year and two-year plans. The exception is Mullvad, which operates on a set monthly price, no matter how long you want the VPN for.\nWe recommend that you choose a VPN for a longer term, as you will pay less. You can use a VPN's 30-day money-back guarantee to see if the VPN suits you, or cancel before this period ends to receive a full refund.\nShould you use a VPN on your phone or tablet?\nIf it's your data, and you want it to be secure, yes. The same choices are valid regardless of what kind of device you use to transmit and receive data over the internet.\nAlso: The best mobile VPNs\nIs it legal to use a VPN?\nYes, in most countries, including the U.S., the U.K., and the majority of Europe. In some countries, VPNs are illegal, or severely discouraged and limited to state-approved software.\nAt the moment, countries including North Korea, Iraq, and Belarus have reportedly banned the use of VPNs entirely. As noted in NordVPN's country guide, others -- like China, Russia, and Egypt -- discourage VPN use and try to stop new adoption by demonizing VPNs as software widely used for criminal activity.\nWorkarounds do exist, but they may come with risks.\nShould I leave a VPN on all of the time?\nWe recommend that you do because a VPN provides a blanket layer of protection for your online activities. If speed loss is problematic during some activities like gaming, at least use one during sensitive activities like accessing financial accounts. You should also always use a VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots.\nDo VPN providers limit usage?\nSome do, so check when you sign up. For non-free plans, none of the providers I recommended limit the amount of data you can use. Some will limit how many devices you can use at once, but for paid plans VPN providers tend to offer more connections than you will need.\nAs a general rule of thumb, free or trial offerings tend to restrict usage, speed, and/or the number of devices you can connect to the VPN, with access and speed increased for paying customers.\nWhat does logging mean with regards to VPN services?\nLogging is the recording of data about your usage, and it occurs everywhere. Every website, at minimum, records an IP address, time, and data accessed so they can track traffic. All VPN providers have to check credentials against recorded personal data to make sure you paid, but some let you sign up with Bitcoin, allowing you to hide your identity.\nWhen I say a VPN doesn't log data, I mean they don't track which sites you visit and for how long, but they may track how much of their infrastructure you use.\nWhat is a VPN kill switch?\nLet's say you're surfing online, and your VPN connection suddenly fails. Your phone or computer will likely immediately try to reconnect and do so directly without going through a VPN. All of a sudden, your data is unprotected.\nA kill switch is a feature in your device's VPN app that detects when a connection fails and immediately shuts down network access. It's not a 100% perfect solution, but we wouldn't recommend using a VPN that doesn't offer a kill switch.\nWhat are simultaneous connections, and why should I care?\nWhen you have multiple devices -- such as a tablet, a laptop, and a smartphone -- and you are using these devices for different tasks, you still want to keep your data and connections secure on each machine.\nWhen you have enabled the VPN on more than one device at the same time, you are using simultaneous connections. It's always best to have this feature in a VPN to ensure your privacy isn't accidentally compromised through one device or another.\nDoes a VPN slow down your connection?\nUsing a VPN can often slow down your connection because your data is encrypted, decrypted, and sent through intermediate servers. Game responsiveness might suffer, for example, or you may notice your streaming service doesn't load as fast as usual.\nWith many high-quality VPNs now available, however, the negative impact is often unnoticeable, unless there is a problem with the VPN server you connect to. To fix this, try a server in a different location and see if that improves your connection.\nWhat about protocol acronyms?\nIf you've been shopping for a VPN service, you've undoubtedly come across a bunch of names like SSL, OpenVPN, SSTP, L2TP/IPSec, PPP, PPTP, IKEv2/IPSec, and SOCKS5. These are all communication protocols. Essentially, they're the method's name by which your communication is encrypted and packaged for tunneling to the VPN provider.\nWhile VPN enthusiasts can argue over protocols for hours, it's probably good enough to use the default setup from your provider.\nWhat VPNs should I avoid?\nYou should avoid VPNs without a long-term customer base or strong customer feedback. Shady VPNs may offer you free services, but they may store or sell your information in return. You should also avoid VPN providers with known security problems and a lack of transparency around resolving them.\nWill my VPN increase in price?\nVPN providers often join in during sales events and offer holiday promotions, reducing the price of a subscription by a few dollars or more. The price will often jump after your promotional period ends, whether this is for an annual plan or a two-year contract. Remember to watch when your subscription ends to avoid costly renewal payments. It might be better to turn off auto-renewal and then sign back up.\nDo I pay for a VPN monthly or yearly?\nTypically, VPN providers model their pricing on a monthly basis, but you may have to pay for your contract upfront when you make your purchase. For example, a VPN available for $2 per month will likely equate to $24 upfront on a yearly contract, plus tax. One of the only exceptions in the market at the moment is Mullvad, which offers a month-by-month price.\nYou enjoy the best discounts when signing up for longer terms. Two years is usually the longest term you can sign up for, although some VPN providers offer five-year subscriptions.\nWhat does a VPN not hide?\nA VPN encrypts your traffic. This means the websites you visit and your online communication, as well as your original IP address. However, a VPN may not be able to hide that you are using a VPN, nor does it hide your device's physical details or information you may submit to a service, such as when you make a financial transaction.\nAlternative VPNs I've tested\nCyberGhost is an excellent option if you want to use a VPN with your favorite streaming service, having high rates of success in our testing over the past year. It also provides specialized servers for streaming optimization and gaming. Plans start at $2.19 per month plus two months free.\nStarting at $2.19 per month with free eSIM gifts, IPVanish is a highly customizable VPN with attractive mobile apps. IPVanish has stable connectivity, good speeds, and a strong server network.\nNote: IPVanish is owned by Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company. For more information, see our Editorial Guidelines.\nMullvad offers the simplest pricing model out there, with costs fixed at \u20ac5, or $5.82, per month, with no differences between monthly or yearly cost. This service is open-source, promoting transparency and security, and Mullvad is known for upholding user privacy.\nWindscribe is an alternative free VPN with up to 10GB of free data per month. Custom plans are also available if you only want access to particular countries, but as a downside, the firm's server network is quite limited.\nWhile very expensive at $12.50 per month, user reports suggest that Astrill VPN is a great option if you need a VPN that works in geo-restricted areas, including China. It's not the fastest or the most stable, according to reports, but something is better than nothing in these cases.\nIf you're looking for a VPN that specializes in particular areas, check out our guides on the best streaming VPNs, the best free VPN solutions, and the best VPNs that come with antivirus protection."

      "text": "How we rate deals at ZDNET in 2025\nEverything is expensive in 2025.\nWe get it. Tech is perhaps one of the most notoriously pricey categories to shop in, and the prices often climb yearly. That's why ZDNET remains committed to sourcing, contextualizing, and sharing the best deals we come across as experts who know the ins and outs of the industry: when new products drop, when old ones see their first discounts, when the best time arrives to buy the next iPhone, TV model, or laptop, or when your cash has the best ROI.\nTo help readers like you find the best deals on the most popular tech products on your wishlist, ZDNET's team of experts combines detailed testing, a keen eye for savings across trusted retailers, familiarity with product pricing, and over 30 years of authority in the tech space to curate deals on dozens of tech items \u2013 from small accessories to laptops to 98-inch TVs and beyond. We don't just bring the deal to you \u2013 we bring all the information you need to know to make an informed decision about how, when, and where to spend your cash (and, of course, what we think is worth spending it on, too).\nAlso: Google just expanded its shopping tools. Here's how to use them\nWhile we often stand to make a referral fee when you buy from one of our links (like most other tech sites ), we often include prices and offers from retailers where we make $0. That's right -- we want you to feel empowered that you're saving the most and getting all the information you need before you add to the cart (both literally and physically). Your trust means more to us than any affiliate link.\nIf you've ever wondered how we evaluate the discounts, deals, and promotional offers that flood the tech market and choose which ones to share with ZDNET readers like you, here's a breakdown of the various aspects we consider.\nHow we rate deals in 2025\nWhat makes a deal ZDNET recommended?\nWe carefully select the range of products we focus our coverage on, so we can be sure we're bringing you the best deals and the most information on products where we have expertise. ZDNET also only writes about deals we would want to buy (or already have) -- devices and products we desire, need or would recommend. Our experts look for deals that are primarily at least 20% off, hardly ever on sale, or unique for their timing (first-time price drop, lowest of the season offer, etc.) by using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.\nAlso: Google Shopping gets an AI-powered upgrade. Here's how to access it\nWe also read customer reviews to learn what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we recommend. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing, extensive research, and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.\nOur deals methodology\nWe use a percentage-off-based system to initially classify savings offered on top-tech products. This system assigns a predetermined set of savings to a corresponding number (1-5), with one being what we classify as a lower-quality savings offer and five being an excellent offer.\n- 1-9% off: 1 / 5 Editor's deal rating\n- 10-19% off: 2 / 5 Editor's deal rating\n- 20-29% off: 3 / 5 Editor's deal rating\n- 30-39% off: 4 / 5 Editor's deal rating\n- 40-50% (or more) off: 5 / 5 Editor's deal rating\nHowever, this system only provides a base ranking to categorize the offers we share on ZDNET. Our team of experts can choose to promote or demote a deal based on several unique factors, including frequency, brand or product recognition, and our expertise. Here's an example.\nApple products are some of the most coveted on the market, and they don't frequently see sales. Our experts know that the best Apple deals surface on select products during holidays or shopping events like Cyber Week or when newer products are introduced into Apple's repertoire. But you'll still be hard-pressed to find Apple products discounted by 30%, 40%, or more regularly. In these cases, we may choose to label a newly released Apple Watch for 15% off as a 4/5 Editor's deal rating instead of a 2/5 due to the context surrounding the offer.\nSimilarly, our experts may adjust deal ratings based on their curated expertise in the product category, the deal's timing, the availability of the product, and other factors. Our deal rating methodology is not a cut-and-dry approach because there's no easy way to classify savings. But it all comes down to being as helpful as possible to you when you spend your hard-earned money.\nSince deals are often available on a limited-time basis (and can expire at any time), we work hard to ensure we're consistently refreshing our content with the most accurate savings. ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best offers to help you maximize your savings so you can feel as confident in your purchases as we feel in our recommendations. Our experts constantly monitor the deals we feature to keep our stories up-to-date. If you missed out on a deal we've shared, don't worry -- we're always sourcing new savings opportunities at ZDNET.com."

It turns out that I'm not as tidy as he was, and I have a tendency to\u2026 misplace things. For me, Apple AirTags have been a total game-changer, and I have them attached to my keys, embedded in my bags and luggage, and even have one in my car and e-bike.\nAlso: He tracked his luggage with an AirTag - what he found was straight out of a movie\nThey're amazing bits of kit, but they do have one big drawback -- they just don't fit well into a purse or wallet. Even at only 0.31 inches (8.0 mm) they make their presence known. While you can get clips and adapters, I don't think they work.\nWhat's needed is a super-thin version of the AirTag -- like the LuLuLook AirCard Pro.\nDesigned to work with the Apple Find My network, at only 0.07-inch (1.8 mm) thick, it's no thicker than two credit cards, so it slips into a wallet, purse, or passport holder like it's been designed to be there. There's a slot cut in the card to accept a luggage tag strap, perfect for keeping an eye on your stuff when traveling. The card comes with a lanyard for you to attach it to, well, whatever you want to track.\nThe AirCard Pro is tough enough to survive the rigors of being bent and flexed in a wallet -- I don't normally go about my life with a leather wallet in my back pocket, but I suffered for this review to make sure it was up to the job.\nAlso: Want to cut your electric bill? Skip these scam 'power-saving' devices - and buy this instead\nThe tag is also IP68 rated, which means that it's completely dustproof and can survive immersion in up to 1.5 meters of water for half an hour, making splashes and rain no problem for it. I left mine out in the UK summer rainstorm, which subsequently turned into a sunny day in the high 80s before raining heavily again in the evening, and it survived.\nWhile regular AirTags are powered by CR2032 button cells, the AirCard Pro has a built-in rechargeable battery (yes, there's a battery in there) that can be recharged using any Qi/MagSafe wireless charger (yes, there's everything you need for wireless charging inside the card too!). The built-in battery lasts about four to five months between recharges, and your iPhone will give you a heads-up when it's time to pop it on the charging pad.\nAlso: I built a custom AirTag that Apple will hate me for (and how you can do it, too)\nThe card has a 150-foot Bluetooth detection range on the iOS Find My app, and it has a built-in speaker that's loud enough to find the tag even if it's buried with your luggage or your wallet is under a pile of sofa cushions.\nThe only feature that this -- and all other third-party finder tags for the Apple platform -- is missing is precision finding, the ability to get real-time distance and directional guidance to the lost item from your iPhone. Other than this, the performance is pretty much on par with that of the AirTag.\nI also tested this by sending it in the mail to myself, and I had no problems following it on its journey around North Wales (it's quite surprising just how fast mail moves once it's collected from the post office).\nZDNET's buying advice\nAt $19 per finder tag, or three for $54, this is a great way to prevent the frustration of misplacing things and a great gift for the absent-minded and easily distracted.\nIt's not the perfect location tracker on the market, as the lack of precision finding can be a shortcoming for some users, but it's hard to nitpick at its sub-$20 price."
