  "title": "Apple AI Plan Hinges on Robots, Cisco CEO Talks Tariffs",
  "description": "Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow discuss Apple\u2019s AI push, which relies on robots, a lifelike version of Siri, and home security devices. Plus, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins talks about AI sales and the impact of tariffs following the company\u2019s earnings report. And WHOOP CEO Will Ahmed defends his company\u2019s decision to keep its blood oxygen tracker operational despite a request from the FDA to disable it. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "BLOOMBERG TECH IS LIVE WITH CAROLINE HYDE IN NEW YORK AND ED LUDLOW IN SAN FRANCISCO. ED: THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. CAN APPLE BE THE AI COMEBACK KID? DETAILS ON THE COMPANY PUSH INTO ROBOTS AND A LIFELIKE SIRI. CAROLINE: WE TALKED TO THE CISCO CEO, CHUCK ROBBINS, FRESH OF EARNINGS. LOOKING UP, BUT PERHAPS CAUTIOUS ON ITS OUTLOOK. ED: AND BITCOIN RETREATS FROM RECORD HIGHS. THE DIGITAL ASSET REMAINS VOLATILE. CAROLINE: AT THE MOMENT, THE NASDAQ 100 HAVING REACHED 20 RECORD HIGHS SHOWING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TODAY. WE ARE FLAT. WE ARE LOWER ON BITCOIN. IT REACHED THAT RECORD HIGH. WE DID BACK DOWN. WE REASSESS WHERE THE FEDERAL RESERVE CAN GO IF INFLATION PRESSURE IS STILL THERE. THAT HAS AFFECTED STOCKS AND RISK ASSETS MORE BROADLY. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE MICRO? ED: I AM KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD TO CISCO. THE STOCK MADE EFFORTS TO GET INTO POSITIVE TERRITORY. A BILLION DOLLARS IN AI RELATED REVENUE IN FISCAL YEAR 2025, BUT THEY GAVE US A SALES OUTLOOK THAT HAS BEEN SEEN AS CAUTIOUS. REALLY, THE STORY WITH CISCO IS ABOUT SOFTWARE AND SECURITY. THE AI STUFF IS DOWN THE ROAD. WE WILL HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION WITH CHUCK ROBBINS, BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT TO ASK ON WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. CAROLINE: EXTRAORDINARY, THE WAY INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE STORY FOR THAT COMPANY. AS TECH GIANTS ARE REALLY TRYING TO PROP THEIR AI PROGRESS, A LOT CENTERS ON ROBOTICS AND HOME SECURITY. SHARES JUMPED AS INVESTORS BET THE MOVE COULD HELP APPLE GET ITS MOJO BACK. LET'S GO TO MARK BERMAN, WHO BROKE THE STORY YESTERDAY ON THE FUTURE OF AI. START WITH THE AI FOCUS. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT? MARK: APPLE IS A HARDWARE COMPANY. THEY HAVE ALL THESE AI FEATURES, BUT FROM A CONSUMER STANDPOINT, HOW DOES APPLE MONETIZE ITS PRODUCTS? BY SELLING HARDWARE, GETTING PEOPLE TO GO TO APPLE STORES AND TO BUY NEW STUFF EVERY YEAR OR TWO. THEY ARE GOING TO REPLAY THAT STRATEGY WHEN IT COMES TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THE WAY THEY CAI IS BY CREATING DEVICES AROUND THE SMART HOME, HOME CAMERAS, AND ROBOTICS. SEVERAL ITEMS WERE REPORTED YESTERDAY. THERE IS A TABLETOP ROBOT. THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A VIRTUAL COMPANION YOU WOULD HAVE IN YOUR BEDROOM, ON YOUR NIGHTSTAND, IN YOUR OFFICE, ON YOUR DESK, ON A KITCHEN COUNTER. IT USES A ROBOTIC ARM TO MOVE AROUND IN SPACE. IT IS LIKE AN IPAD THAT CAN MOVE THROUGH THIN AIR ON THAT ROBOTIC LIMB. YOU CAN HOLD CONVERSATIONS WITH IT. IF YOU ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, IT CAN INTERJECT AND JUMP IN, AS IF IT IS A THIRD PERSON IN THE ROOM. IT CAN USE VIDEO, FACETIME. IT WAS ALSO A SMART HOME HUB WITH A SCREEN, COMING OUT NEXT SPRING. THIS IS GOING TO HAVE SIMILAR FUNCTIONALITY TO THAT DEVICE WITHOUT THE CONVERSATIONAL ABILITIES, WITHOUT THE ROBOTIC ARM. AND THEY ARE DEVELOPING HOME SECURITY AND HOME AUTOMATION PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO RIVAL WHAT AMAZON HAS BEEN DOING WITH THE RING AND BLANK, AND WHAT GOOGLE HAS BEEN DOING WITH NEST. OTHER COMPANIES IN THE SPACE INCLUDE ADT AND ROKU. ED: THERE IS A SOFTWARE COMPONENT, AND THAT IS SIRI. YOU DESCRIBE A LIFELIKE SIRI. HOW HAVE SOURCES DESCRIBED IT TO YOU? MARK: IT CAN HOLD CONVERSATIONS, INTERJECT INTO CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS AS IF IT IS ANOTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM. SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON VOICE MODE FROM CHATGPT, GEMINI, AND SOME OF THESE OTHER LLM-BASED ASSISTANCE. THERE IS ALSO A REVAMP NEXT YEAR ON THE IPHONE, IPAD, AND THE MAC. IT IS AN UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURAL CHANGE, BUT THERE IS ALSO A VISUAL REDESIGN COMING TO THE IPHONE AND IPAD. ON THE HOME DEVICES SPECIFICALLY, THEY ARE GOING TO BE CREATING A VISUAL PERSONALITY FOR SIRI. OBVIOUSLY, YOU HEARD IT AND YOU SPOKE TO IT. NOW, YOUR GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT. IF YOU REMEMBER COULD BE FROM THE 1990'S AND THE EARLY 2000S'S IN THE MICROSOFT SUITE OF OFFICE APPS, SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT. IT POPS UP ON YOUR DISPLAY. YOU CAN INTERACT WITH IT AT ANY TIME. THEY ARE TRYING TO CREATE A VIRTUAL CHARACTER EITHER BASED ON AN EMOJI OR THE FILESYSTEM LOGO THAT APPLE HAS USED FOR YEARS ON THE MAC. CAROLINE: THE BLOOD OXYGEN, THE WORKAROUND WITH THE FLIGHT TO APPLE -- IS IT GOING TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT IN THE LONG-TERM? MARK: IT IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE IT IS A REAL WORKAROUND. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE BLOOD OXYGEN APP LIKE YOU DID BEFORE ON THE APPLE WATCH. THE SENSORS WILL BE USED, AND THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO READ THE DATA ON THE PHONE ITSELF, THROUGH THE HEALTH APP. IT TOOK THEM TWO YEARS. THE U.S. CUSTOMS AGENCY FINALLY ALLOWED THEM TO DO THIS WORKAROUND. IT COMES AT AN OPPORTUNE TIME. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MARKET IN THE U.S. AND BLOOD OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING IS PART OF THAT. ED: MARK GURMAN WILL DETAIL WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ON APPLE. FOR MORE, DAN IVES OF WEDBUSH JOINS US. MARK'S REPORTING MOVES THE NEEDLE. WE KNOW THIS TABLETOP ROBOT WILL BE THE CENTERPIECE ON THE HARDWARE SIDE. WE KNOW THAT SIRI WILL BE MADE MORE LIFELIKE. HAS THIS CHANGED WHAT YOU ARE MODELING FOR APPLE AND THE KIND OF COMEBACK THAT MANY THINK APPLE NEEDS TO HAVE IN THE AI DOMAIN? DAM: THEIR AI STRATEGY HAS BEEN A DISASTER. LOOK AT ANY OTHER BIG TECH COMPANY, APPLE IS MASSIVELY BEHIND. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS AS A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY, I THINK STREET HAS BASICALLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS. ROBOTICS, APPLE IS GOING TO COME OUT WITH ANOTHER DEVICE. LOOK AT OPENAI, MICROSOFT, META. RIGHT NOW, THERE IS AN F1 RACE, PASSING BY. AN APPLE AND COOK ARE WATCHING FROM A PARK BENCH, DRINKING A CAPPUCCINO. DAN: THAT IS MAYBE A VEILED REFERENCE TO THE BE WDC AND PUTS THE EMPHASIS BACK ON SIRI. IF IT IS TO BE A TOOL USED DAILY BY TECHNOLOGY USERS AROUND THE WORLD, IN THE SAME WAY THAT CHATGPT IS -- DOWN: LET'S CALL IT LIKE IT IS. SIRI, NOTHING COULD HAPPEN INTERNALLY. INTERNALLY, THIS HAS BEEN A DISASTER. YOU GO BACK TO WWDC AND IT FELT LIKE A MICHAEL J FOX \"BACK TO THE FUTURE\" MOMENT. THEY CONTINUE TO MISS WHAT IS NEXT. THEY HAVE TO DO AN ACQUISITION. IT IS THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION. IT IS NOT HAPPENING INTERNALLY. THERE IS NO ONE IN THE STREET THAT BELIEVES ANY INNOVATION IS COMING OUT OF APPLE WHEN IT COMES TO AI FOR THE IPHONE. CAROLINE: YOU STILL HAVE AN OUTPERFORM AND A 270 DOLLAR PRICE TARGET ON APPLE. YOU ARE SOUNDING MORE CAUTIOUS THAN YOUR MONEY PERSPECTIVE IS LEADING US. ED: TO GET TO 270 IS NO AI. YOU SAW THE TARIFFS, COOK PLAYING NICE IN THE SANDBOX WITH TRUMP. THAT WAS A HUGE RELIEF. I THINK THE STOCK COULD GO TO 270 OR 280 WITHOUT AI. FOR THIS TO BE 350, 4 AND $50 STOCK -- IT IS AI, AND IT IS NOT HAPPENING INTERNALLY. AND I THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM THE STREET HAS. THINGS LIKE ROBOTICS, NEXT GEN, IT IS ALL ABOUT SOFTWARE. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, WE CAN TALK ABOUT PERPLEXITY. OTHER ACQUISITIONS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. IT IS NOT HAPPENING INTERNALLY. THAT IS JUST THE REALITY. CAROLINE: THE NOTES YOU HAVE BEEN PUTTING OUT HAVE BEEN -- THERE WAS A RELIEF WHEN TIM COOK ALONGSIDE PRESIDENT TRUMP LAST WEEK. THIS WEEK, IT HAS BEEN ABOUT NVIDIA, AMD, AND PAY TO PLAY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE MOVES WE HAVE SEEN TO GAIN ACCESS IN CHINA? ED: IT SPEAKS TO A \"GODFATHER\" QUOTE. IT'S A DEAL YOU CANNOT REFUSE. BIG TECH CEO'S ARE LEARNING THE NEW RULES OF THE DAY. NVIDIA, THEY NEED TO DO IT. 15% IS BREADCRUMBS, RELATIVE TO GETTING INTO A CHINA MARKET. I VIEW IT AS BULLISH. IT IS GOING TO PUT MORE FUEL IN THE ENGINE OF AI. ED: SUPER QUICKLY, WE BROKE THE STORY THAT DOJO IS NO MORE AT TESLA, AND MUSK HAS COME OUT AND KIND OF EXPLAINED IT, THE FOCUS ON A I-5 AND AI SIX. HOW DID YOU REACT TO THAT? I DON'T THINK I SAW A NOTE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE STOPGAP BETWEEN CUSTOM SILICON GENERATIONS? DAN: XAI WILL HAVE A MASSIVE INVESTMENT. THAT WILL COME AT THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING. I THINK MORE AND MORE ARE RECOGNIZING THIS IS GOING TO BE A HOLISTIC STRATEGY. IT IS ALL ABOUT AUTONOMOUS AND ROBOTICS. I THINK IF YOU READ THROUGH THE TEA LEAVES, THAT WAS IT. CAROLINE: GREAT TO CATCH UP WITH YOU. MEANWHILE, THE CISCO CEO JOINING US TO DISCUSS THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS, AND THE STATE OF INFRASTRUCTURE DEMAND. \u266a ED: CISCO SHARES ARE DOWN ABOUT 1.2%, 1.3%. THEY KIND OF BOUNCED BACK. WE HAVE THIS FOR YOUR REVENUE OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL YEAR THE 26. SOME ANALYSTS THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE CAUTIOUS, BUT WE ARE SEEING ORDERS PICK UP. WE ARE JOINED BY THE CISCO CEO. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU SOMETHING THAT I FELT LIKE THE ANALYST COMMUNITY DID NOT REALLY GET TO. THAT IS THAT THERE IS THIS BIG PRODUCT REFRESH HAPPENING. NEAR TERM, OVERCOMING YEARS. I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TALK ABOUT CISCO AS A PLATFORM OFFERING FOR A WHILE. IF WE LOOK AT THAT OUTLOOK, IS THAT BAKED INTO THAT BY CISCO AS A PLATFORM OFFERING, AND YOU FOLDED SECURITY INTO IT? THAT IS KIND OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW. > > THANKS FOR HAVING ME, AND I WANT TO THANK THE TEAM FOR A GREAT YEAR. WE OBVIOUSLY HAD GOOD ORDER GROWTH IN Q4. WE HAD GREAT PERFORMANCE IN THE AI INFRASTRUCTURE ORDERS. WE ACTUALLY REPORTED THAT WE HAD TAKEN DOWN APPROXIMATELY A BILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE FROM THOSE ORDERS, WHICH WAS SOMETHING EVERYBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE HAD PROGRESS ON SECURITY. TO YOUR POINT, THIS PRODUCT REFRESH CYCLE WE ARE BEGINNING WILL HAPPEN OVER YEARS. HONESTLY, THE LARGE CUSTOMERS TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO EVALUATE, PUT THESE THINGS IN LABS BEFORE THEY PUT IT IN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT THE POINTS YOU MAKE ABOUT THE PLATFORM IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AS WE GET INTO AGENTIC AI, WITH THE LOW LATENCY, CONSTANT COMMUNICATION THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SECURITY IN THE NETWORK. THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. YOU CANNOT INTRODUCE LATENCY BY SENDING IT TO A SECURITY APPLIANCE. WE ARE THE ONLY COMPANY THAT HAS NETWORKING AND SECURITY TO FORM THAT PLATFORM EFFECT YOU ARE DESCRIBING. ED: AI IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD. IT IS MARGIN DILUTIVE. HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? CHUCK: WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD VARIOUS MARGIN PROFILES. WE HAD THE TELCO AND SERVICE PROVIDER WORLD BE PART OF OUR BUSINESS, AND THAT WAS A DIFFERENT MARGIN PROFILE THAN ENTERPRISE. I AM NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT IT. CAROLINE: THAT MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY WITH AI INFRASTRUCTURE, BRINGING IN A BILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE ALREADY, IS IT THE PLATFORM OFFERING THAT HELPS YOU PUSH OUT AND FEND AGAINST SOME OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS THAT WANT IN ON THAT? IS THAT HOW YOU SET YOURSELF APART? CHUCK: I THINK THE KEY TO REMEMBER IS IT IS NETWORK SYSTEMS AND OPTICS. AND THERE ARE REALLY ONLY THREE COMPANIES ON THE PLANET THAT CAN DELIVER THE NETWORKING SILICON THAT THESE CUSTOMERS REQUIRE, AND WE ARE ONE OF THEM. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR LOW POWER REQUIREMENTS, FOR MEETING THEIR DATES, SPEED, BANDWIDTH, DEPLOYMENT. AND WE ARE HITTING THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THEM. IF YOU GO BACK FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO, I HAD TO TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT WE WERE REBUILDING RELATIONSHIPS HERE. EVEN 12, 14 MONTHS AGO, WITH THE TARGET OF $12 BILLION IN ORDERS, THERE WERE A LOT OF SKEPTICS, AND THE TEAM DELIVERED REALLY WELL. WE HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS. CAROLINE: YOU BE THINGS THAT PREVIOUSLY OTHERS WERE CYNICAL OF, BUT THE MARKET MOVES WITH YOU. MANY WANT EVEN MORE IN TERMS OF YOUR FULL-YEAR YEAR REVENUE GUIDANCE. SOME EVEN GOING AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING A BIT OF A CAUTIOUS I T SPEND FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. DO YOU ABIDE BY THAT? CHUCK: WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY SORT OF SLOW DOWN AT ALL. THE ONLY PLACE WE HAVE SEEN THAT CHALLENGE WAS IN U.S. FEDERAL. OUR PRODUCT ORDER GROWTH WAS 7%. IF YOU TAKE AT U.S. FEDERAL, WE GREW 10%. SECURITIES, SAME THING. IF WE TAKE AT U.S. FEDERAL, WE GREW DOUBLE DIGITS IN SECURITY ON ORDERS. I ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE FISCAL YEAR WE JUST ENTERED, OUR U.S. FEDERAL TEAM IS ACTUALLY FORECASTING A RETURN TO GROWTH. THAT WILL BE A HEADWIND IN THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING MEANINGFUL, BUT WE ARE COGNIZANT WE ARE OPERATING IN A COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT. ED: WE LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THE BIG DATA CENTER PROJECTS. ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THAT YOU THINK ARE REALLY NEEDLE MOVING FOR CISCO? CHUCK: ALL THE CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE NEEDLE MOVING. WE THINK THAT WILL BE A BIG PART OF OUR BUSINESS. ALSO, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED IN SOVEREIGN CLOUDS. IF I HIT ON A FEW OF THOSE, THE SOVEREIGN AI DATA CENTERS WE TALKED ABOUT IN UAE, AS WELL AS IN SAUDI, ARE THE EARLY ONES. WE ARE HAVING DISCUSSIONS IN AFRICA, AND IN EUROPE, YOU HAVE THIS PUSH FOR ON PREMISE SOVEREIGN APPLICATIONS, SO FROM A GEOPOLITICAL PERSPECTIVE AND A RISK PERSPECTIVE, THEY WANT MORE CONTROL OVER THE TECH STACK IN THEIR COUNTRIES. THAT IS MORE OF A SOVEREIGN PLAY. WE ARE ONE OF THE UNIQUE COMPANIES THAT CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER THAT ON PRIM. AND THEN THE NEO-CLOUDS, WE COULD TALK ABOUT AS WELL. THAT IS ANOTHER EMERGING OPPORTUNITY FOR US. ED: I DON'T THINK MANY APPRECIATE THE SCALE OF CISCO SOMETIMES. YOU HAVE A LOT OF CREDIT ON THIS PROGRAM ABOUT THE WAY YOU HAVE COMMUNICATED THE TARIFF IMPACT. YOU ARE BASICALLY ONE OF THE LEADING NETWORK TO PRODUCERS GLOBALLY. AND THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT WANTS MORE U.S. MANUFACTURING. YOU HAVE THE VOLUME. YOU DESIGN YOUR OWN CHIPS. THE ECONOMICS KIND OF WORKS IN YOUR FAVOR. HAVE YOU MADE SOME COMMITMENT TO DO WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DO, WHICH IS TAKE THAT PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE MASTERED, BUT BRING IT TO THE STATES IN SOME FORM? CHUCK: I THINK THAT, MUCH LIKE NVIDIA, AMD, US, OTHERS, THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT RELY ON TSMC FOR THE FABRICATION OF THE SILICA AND. THEY HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS ON THEIR SIDE TO BUILD CAPACITY IN THE UNITED STATES, SO WE ARE HAPPY TO SEE THAT HAPPENING. THE THING THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY REALIZE IS THAT WE HAVE MAINTAINED A U.S. MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT ALL ALONG. WE HAVE A FOOTPRINT IN THE U.S. TODAY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT EXPANDING, BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US RIGHT NOW TO WAIT AND SEE EXACTLY WHERE ALL THIS STUFF LANDS. IF YOU GO BACK TO 2018, WHEN THE CHINA TARIFFS HIT, OUR TEAMS MADE MOVES AND MITIGATED ROUGHLY 80% OF THOSE. SO WE JUST CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS AS THEY COME OUT, FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST PLAN OF ACTION IS, AND WE ACT. CAROLINE: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PLANNING AHEAD AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY, AND YOU SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH AMD AND NVIDIA, AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EXPORTING MORE BROADLY, ARE YOU THINKING THAT MIGHT COME YOUR WAY, A PAY TO PLAY, IN THE FUTURE? CHUCK: I HAVE NO IDEA. WE WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TRANSPIRED AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD, AND HOW WE REACT TO IT. THE CURRENT CROP OF CEO'S IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BASICALLY BEEN OPERATING IN TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY OR CRISIS, OR CERTAINLY VERY DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS. WE ARE ALL USED TO JUST DEALING WITH WHATEVER CHANGES ARE COMING OUR WAY. THERE IS THE OLD SAYING THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH THE WORLD AS IT IS OR HOW YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. WE JUST WAKE UP AND WE DEAL WITH WHAT COMES AT US, AND TRY TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY, TRY TO DO SCENARIO PLANNING, AND THEN DEAL WITH IT AS IT IS. CAROLINE: AND WHEN YOU ARE CONTROLLING YOUR OWN DESTINY, YOU MENTIONED THIS OFFERING AND HOW IT HELPS YOU ACCESS EUROPE, FOR EXAMPLE. ANYMORE M & A ON THE HORIZON WHEN IT COMES TO AI? CHUCK: WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING. VALUATIONS ARE FROTHY IN THAT SPACE. IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HELPS US ADVANCE OUR STRATEGY MORE EFFECTIVELY, WE ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. I WOULD SAY M & A IS NOT THE STRATEGY. WE HAVE OUR PRODUCTS STRATEGY AND SOLUTION STRATEGY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. IF THERE IS AN ACQUISITION THAT HELPS US ACCELERATE THAT, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN. YOU THINK ABOUT AI INFRASTRUCTURE OR SECURITY OR OBSERVABILITY. THOSE AREAS ARE ALWAYS INTERESTING TO US. ED: HOW IS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH NVIDIA EVOLVING? CHUCK: IT IS GREAT. OUR TEAM AND THEIR TEAM'S EXECS HAD DINNER LAST NIGHT. WORKING ON ARCHITECTURES FOR NEO-CLOUD, ARCHITECTURES FOR ENTERPRISE, WORKING ON JOINT GO TO MARKET TOGETHER. I WOULD SAY IT JUST CONTINUES TO GET STRONGER. WE ARE BUILDING ON THE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATIONS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON, AND WE ARE ON THE FRONT-END OF THE REAL ENTERPRISE WAVE OF THIS AI. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT STARTED IN THE BACK AND NETWORKS OF THE CLOUD PROVIDERS. IT IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE FRONT AND NETWORKS, ON THE ENTERPRISE, AND EVEN THE TELCO BUSINESS WE SAW THIS QUARTER. WE HAD TELCO ORDERS UP 20%. A LOT OF THAT WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR PREPARATION FOR AA -- AI. CAROLINE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED. COMING UP, A NEW FEATURE IN HOPES IT WILL BOOST RESERVATIONS. \u266a CAROLINE: TIME NOW FOR TALKING TECH. AND NVIDIA PARTNER WAS EXPECTING SALES OF ITS SERVICE TO MORE THAN DOUBLE THIS QUARTER. THE COMPANY SEES A 170% RISE IN REVENUE. THE EXECUTIVES ARE WARNING THAT THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS BUSINESS COULD SHRINK THIS YEAR AS IT FACES U.S. TARIFFS. ORACLE IS CUTTING BACK JOBS, BECOMING THE LATEST COMPANY TO TAKE STEPS TO CONTROL COSTS AMID HEAVY SPENDING ON AI INFRASTRUCTURE. ACCORDING TO SOURCES, MORE THAN 150 JOBS WERE CUT IN THE SEATTLE AREA, TRADITIONALLY THE UNITS HUB. LAST YEAR, THEY SAID THEY WERE MOVING HEADQUARTERS TO NASHVILLE. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS MORE JOBS LISTED IN TENNESSEE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. AIRBNB WILL NOW ALLOW GUESTS TO RESERVE SOME U.S. TRIPS WITHOUT PAYING UPFRONT. IT LETS USERS BOOK IN ADVANCE WITHOUT THE NEED TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT UNTIL EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE CANCELLATION PERIOD. THE MOVE COMES AFTER LAST WEEK'S MODERATE GAINS. ED: COMING UP, CRISIS OF BITCOIN AND ETHER ARE DOWN FOLLOWING STRONGER THAN ANTICIPATED INFLATION. CRYPTO RELATED COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ON A BIT OF A TEAR RECENTLY. LET'S THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE NAMES WE WERE LOOKING AT. APPLE HAD A REALLY STRONG DAY YESTERDAY. A LITTLE SOFTER TODAY. CISCO, WE JUST HAD THE CONVERSATION WITH CHUCK ROBBINS. THE MARKET WILL DIGEST. COREWEAVE IS DOWN 11%. IT IS BASICALLY THE COST OF ITS BUILDOUT AND SCALING SPOOKING INVESTORS. CHECK OUT OUR INTERVIEW FROM YESTERDAY. IT WAS A BIG ONE. \u266a ED: WELCOME BACK. I'M LOOKING AT THE CRYPTO AND THE INDUSTRY AT LARGE. IT HAS BEEN A HEAVY NEWS FLOW BETWEEN FOUR HOURS. IT GOING AND ETHER WERE PUSHING FRESH RECORD HIGHS. LARGELY, THIS APPETITE FOR RISK ASSETS. YOU HAVE THIS PPI PRINT, THIS WHOLESALE INFLATION PRINT THAT WAS HIGH. IT IS NOT JUST STOCKS. YOU SEE THAT IN DIGITAL CURRENCIES AS WELL. BULLISH AFTER AN ASTONISHING DAY YESTERDAY. IT IS AN ADJACENT CRYPTO PLATFORM. THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IN THAT SINGLE NAME AT LEAST, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF BULLISH SENTIMENT OUT THERE. LET'S MOVE ON. CAROLINE: WE PARDON YOU THE PUN. FULLER SENTIMENT ACROSS THE BOARD. WE ARE JOINED BY A PARTNER AT A VENTURE FIRM BASED ON EARLY STAGE BLOCKCHAIN INNOVATION. IS IT HELPFUL OR NOT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF RISK ON ATTITUDE IN THE MARKET THAT IS PUSHING NEW IPO'S INTO THE CRYPTO SPHERE? IT IS DICTATED BY MACRO PERSPECTIVE OF WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE GOING. IS THAT HELPFUL FOR THE FORMATION OF NEW BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW? > > 100%. WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH DIGITAL ASSETS IN THE MARKET -- $500 FOR HYPER LIQUIDS. THAT IS COMING INTO THE MARKET DIRECTLY AT NASDAQ. IT IS CREATING A VERY INTERESTING PRESSURE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY, WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET TO BUY, BECAUSE WE HAVE OVER $4 BILLION TREASURIES COMING INTO THE MARKET. SO WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF CHANGES. CAROLINE: THIS IS THE MICROSTRATEGY, BEING ABLE TO HOLD BITCOIN, NOW MOVING TO OTHER ASSETS, ON BASICALLY YOUR BALANCE SHEET, USING IT AS A TREASURY. IT IS STARTING TO TRICKLE DOWN INTO SLIGHTLY RISKIER ASSETS. LOOK AT WHAT LISTED YESTERDAY. WE ARE SEEING THEY ARE GOING TO BE BUYING UP WORLD LIBERTY COIN, ONE THAT YOU CANNOT TRADE FREELY ANYWAY, AND NOW THEY ARE HAVING A PUBLICLY TRADED ENTITY THAT IS GOING TO BE THERE EVENTUALLY TO BUY UP A LOAD OF THAT ASSET. IT HAS THE TRUMPS INVOLVED, THE WITKOFF'S INVOLVED. IS IT GOOD TO SEE THAT HAPPEN? > > IT IS GOOD AND BAD. THE GOOD IS THAT IT IS AN APPETITE. SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A DEMAND FOR IT, WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE MARKET. THE DOWNSIDE IS, WHERE DOES THE BUCK STOP? WE ARE NOW SEEING ASSETS COMING IN AND RAISING $300 MILLION, $400 MILLION, AND COMPLETELY GOING CRAZY. CAROLINE: RETAIL INVESTORS? WHO ARE THEY RAISING FROM? > > A BUNCH OF CRYPTO FIRMS ARE DOING DIGITAL ASSET TREASURIES. A LOT OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ETF OF SOLANA -- WHERE DO THEY GET ACCESS TO THESE? THAT DOES RAISE A QUESTION -- IS IT ANOTHER BUMP ON WALL STREET? AND WHO IS GOING TO HAVE LIQUIDITY HERE? IS IT GOING TO BE INSIDERS, OR IS IT A NEW LANDSCAPE FOR THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF, THREE YEARS? ED: YOU INVEST AT THE EARLIEST STAGE, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CURVE, FOUNDED ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL UNDERPINNING OF EVERYTHING YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. I SEE ROBINHOOD AND STRIPE IN THE BANKS LOOKING AT STABLECOIN IN PARTICULAR, WANTING TO DO THEIR OWN THING. HOW DISRUPTIVE IS THAT TO YOU AT THAT SCALE THAT ACTIVITY IS HAPPENING? YOU HAVE FULLY FULLY ACCOMPANIES DOING SOMETHING AT A DIFFERENT SCALE. > > IT IS FASCINATING. NOW, AS AN INVESTMENT FIRM, WE ARE GOING INTO A SPACE WHERE WE HAVE DEMAND, SO MUCH BRAINPOWER DEMAND. SOME OF THE CEO'S WHICH FOR YEARS BACK WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE ME A SECOND IN THEIR SCHEDULE ARE NOW HOSTING US FOR DINNERS, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW ARE THESE CROSS CHAIN STABLECOINS GOING TO SETTLE, AND HOW ARE THE MONEY MARKETS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO THEIR OWN STABLECOIN PLATFORM, AND WANT TO ISSUE THEIR OWN STABLECOIN. I HAVE A FEELING THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE 20 IPO'S, WITH STRIKE, ROBINHOOD. I'M PRETTY SURE SQUARE IS GOING TO COME ON THE BLOCK. FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM WILL HAVE THEIR OWN STABLECOIN. WHO IS GOING TO HAVE A DISTRIBUTION? EVERYONE IS GOING TO HAVE THEIR STABLECOIN BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORM. CAROLINE: IF EVERYBODY IS GETTING INTO THE SPACE, IF WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE ACTIVITY IN THE SPACE, HOW DO YOU PROTECT ANY DOWNSIDE, OR IS IT JUST DOING YOUR DUE DILIGENCE IN SHOWING YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TRADABLE THE ASSET IS THAT YOU ARE GETTING INTO, IN THE FUTURE OF THE DIGITAL ASSET FROM A PROJECT PERSPECTIVE? > > I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL OF INVESTING IN DIGITAL ASSETS WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THE SAME -- TECHNOLOGY. IS IT SCALABLE? WE HAVE NEW ACQUISITIONS BY SOME OF THE.COM PEOPLE. IS IT AN INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION PRODUCT? CAN THE FOUNDERS TAKE IT TO A BANK AND SAY WE CAN SELL ALL YOUR REPOSE? THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS IF I JUST LOOK AT THE LIQUID FUND AND THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, JUST BECAUSE OF WHERE THE MARKET IS TODAY. I'M REALIZING THAT THE DIGITAL ASSET TREASURIES TREND IS NOT DONE YET. IT IS STILL NOT AT THE PEAK. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE IN THE U.K. MARKET, SMALLER EUROPEAN AND ASIAN MARKETS, ARE SUDDENLY WAKING UP TO IT. THAT IS THE DEMAND YOU ARE GETTING. ANYTHING UNDER A BILLION DOLLARS IS NOW GOING INTO THOSE ASIAN MARKETS AND RAISING ANOTHER LAYER OF INVESTMENTS. THAT EXCITES ME, BOTHERS ME, AND MAKES ME VERY CURIOUS AT THE SAME TIME. ED: GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE SHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMING UP, THE FORMER CEO OF TWITTER HAS SQUARED OFF AGAINST ELON MUSK. HE IS BACK. HE HAS A NEW AI START UP AND HE IS GOING TO JOIN US TO TALK ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE AND WHAT HE IS DOING NOW. \u266a THE FORMER CEO OF WHAT WAS THEN KNOWN AS TWITTER HAS MOVED ON FROM HIS DAYS SPARRING WITH ELON MUSK. HIS NEW COMPANY, PARALLEL WEB SYSTEMS, IS BUILDING A TOOL TO HELP AI AGENTS NAVIGATE THE WEB. IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK IN THE WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY, AT LEAST PUBLICLY BACK IN THE WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY. I WAS READING ABOUT PARALLEL WEB SYSTEMS, THE IDEA THAT THE CUSTOMER IS THE AI AGENT. TELL US ABOUT THE START UP AND WHAT YOU ARE DOING IT. > > FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. AT TWITTER, ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS DOING WAS TINKERING AROUND. I WAS ACTUALLY BUILDING THE AI AGENTS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT WERE MOSTLY COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM THE WEB, BRINGING IT BACK TO ME, SO THAT I COULD READ IT. I HAD A COUPLE OF REALIZATIONS, DOING SO. ONE, THAT THE AI AGENTS ARE GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY CUSTOMER OF THE WEB, GOING FORWARD. THEY WOULD USE THE WEB A LOT MORE THAN HUMANS EVER HAVE. THE WEB THAT EXISTS IS NOT GREAT FOR THEM. IT IS NOT READY FOR THEM. EVERYTHING THE WEB HAS DONE OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS HAS BEEN BUILT FOR HUMANS. FOR AI'S, IT IS DIFFERENT. THAT IS THE PROBLEM WE HAVE STARTED TO TACKLE AND THAT IS WHY WE DESCRIBE AI AGENTS AS OUR PRIMARY CUSTOMER. ED: THERE IS NEWS WE ARE BREAKING THAT YOU HAVE RAISED AROUND $30 MILLION FOR PARALLEL. THAT IS A LOT, OUT THE GATE. TELL US ABOUT HOW THAT WENT AROUND. > > WHEN WE STARTED WITH THIS VISION, OUR VISION IS A BIG VISION TRYING TO REALLY TRANSFORM WHAT THE OPEN WEB LOOKS LIKE. DOING SO, REIMAGINING FROM THE GROUND UP, EVERY PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN CRAWL THE INDEX, RANKING SYSTEMS, COMPLETELY NEW INTERFACES FOR AI SYSTEMS. WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE TO BUILD ALL OF THIS. THE TEAM WE HAVE IS ALSO THE ONE NEEDED TO TAKE ON THIS PROBLEM. THE TEAM AROUND ME IS THE TEAM THAT BUILT A LOT OF THE KEY PARTS OF THE HUMAN WEB, WHETHER IT BE TWITTER AND SNAP, MARKETPLACES. THE BEST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BUILT THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE WEB RECOGNIZING WAYS IN WHICH IT DOES NOT SERVE THE NEEDS. THIS FUTURE WEB. CAROLINE: ED STARTED OFF BY SAYING THE CUSTOMER IS THE AGENT, BUT WHO IS THE CUSTOMER? MORE BROADLY, WHOSE PROBLEMS ARE YOU SOLVING? ARE YOU BUSY BUILDING THE AGENTIC PLATFORMS? > > IF YOU THINK OF ANY PIECE OF SOFTWARE OR ANY WORKFLOW, BOTH OF THOSE ARE CHANGING. IT MIGHT BE INCORPORATING MODELS LIKE LOM'S INTO THEM. IT ALMOST FEELS SILLY TO NOT HAVE ACCESS FOR THE OPEN WEB IN ORDER TO SERVE YOUR CUSTOMERS OR DO YOUR WORKFLOWS. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. WE WORK WITH A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DO IS UNDERWRITING, WHEREIN THERE ARE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT SPEND 30 MINUTES, PERHAPS TWO HOURS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT? YOU UNDERSTAND THE SIGNALS ANYWHERE ON THE WEB. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR HUMAN OPERATIONS FOREVER. AS WE START WORKING WITH THEM AND THEY INCORPORATED OUR AA -- APIS, COMBINING ALL OF THE DATA FROM THE WEB WITH ALL OF THE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THEY HAVE COLLECTED, THEY WERE ABLE TO OUTPERFORM HUMANS MEANINGFULLY. IN TERMS OF QUALITY, IT TURNS OUT HUMANS HALLUCINATE TOO. CAROLINE: YOU BUILT PARALLEL WEB SYSTEMS ON THE HEELS OF YEARS LEADING TWITTER. YOU WERE KNOWN AS BUILDING MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS. WHAT LESSONS HAVE YOU LEARNED TO BRING TO THIS NEW COMPANY? > > ONE, PART OF THE LESSONS FROM THE PAST NO LONGER APPLY. WHEN WE THINK OF BUILDING MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS, THEY LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE SYSTEMS WE ARE NOW ABLE TO BUILD, COMPARING TO 2014, THE VELOCITY OF INFORMATION. WHAT REMAINS SIMILAR IS THE MINDSET OF SOLVING PROBLEMS AND TO AND, DEALING WITH STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS. THESE ARE THE LESSONS THAT INFORM US. ED: SUN VALLEY, 2022, I WAS THERE. I REMEMBER SEEING YOU THERE, AND EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWED. FOR THE FIRST TIME, REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT HAPPENED. PLEASE. > > WHAT HAPPENED WAS WE BUILT FOR 11 YEARS THAT I WAS AT TWITTER ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL PLATFORMS IN THE WORLD. IT ALLOWED EVERYONE TO SPEAK AND HEAR DIRECTLY FROM OTHERS. AND THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT. AND I AM VERY PROUD OF WHAT I WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR. OF COURSE, THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO BE DONE. IT REMAINS A PLATFORM THAT MATTERS TO THE WORLD, BUT MY NEW MISSION MOVES FROM THAT. HOW DO YOU KEEP THE WEB OPEN? IT IS THE SAME MISSION AROUND ALLOWING EVERYONE TO PUBLISH, ALLOWING EVERY AI TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS WHAT EVERYONE IS PUBLISHING, FREELY. WE MIGHT HAVE A BUNCH OF PAYWALL'S. ON AI MODEL ABLE TO ACCESS SOME PARTS OF THE WEB ON THE COMPUTER. IT IS NOT THE FUTURE I WANT. CAROLINE: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THE CEO OF PARALLEL WEB SYSTEMS AND PREVIOUSLY CEO OF TWITTER. ED: ESCALATING TENSIONS WITH THE FDA. I SPEAK TO WHOOP'S WILL AHMED. \u266a CAROLINE: FITNESS BAND MAKER WHOOP IS REFUSING TO DISABLE ITS BLOOD PRESSURE TRACKING TOOL, DESPITE COMPLAINTS BY THE FDA IT IS ACTING AS A MEDICAL DEVICE. WILL, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW THAT THE FDA DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY IN THIS MOMENT FOR THIS NOT MEDICAL DEVICE, THIS MEDICAL -- WILL: THIS WELLNESS DEVICE? WILL:WHOOP -- THIS WELLNESS DEVICE? WILL: WHOOP DEVELOPED A FEATURE THAT CALIBRATES THE CUFF AND ALLOWS THE WE ARE A BULL TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A DAILY ESTIMATE OF YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE. THIS GIVES YOU INSIGHTS ON HOW YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE MIGHT AFFECT OTHER THINGS IN YOUR WELLNESS. THIS COULD BE SLEEP, STRESS, NUTRITION. DIFFERENT WELLNESS FACTORS. THE FDA HAS COME FORWARD SAYING THEY BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE REGULATED. THE 21ST CENTURY CURES ACT MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT WELLNESS INTENDED FEATURES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REGULATED BY THE FDA, AND THE FDA'S INTENDED TO ACTUALLY JUST REGULATE MEDICAL DEVICES THAT ARE DIAGNOSING SOMETHING. SO THERE IS THIS KEY QUESTION OF INTENDED USE. YOU CAN SEE THIS WITH OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS LIKE HEART RATE MONITORING, FOR EXAMPLE. HEART RATE MONITORING HAS WELLNESS APPLICATIONS AND MEDICAL APPLICATIONS. WELLNESS APPLICATIONS MIGHT BE EXERCISE OR STRESS MONITORING OR SLEEP MONITORING. WE DO ALL THAT. ALTERNATIVELY, THAT COULD BE A DIAGNOSIS FOR AFIB. THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE WHERE THE FDA WOULD. ED: YOU ARE A SMART GUY AND YOU EMPLOY LOTS OF SMART PEOPLE. WHY NOT JUST GO THROUGH THE FDA PROCESS IN THE FIRST PLACE, FORESEEING THIS MIGHT COME UP? WILL: WELL, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE DIFFERENT USE CASES. ONE USE CASE FOR BLOOD PRESSURE IS AROUND WELLNESS. THERE ARE OTHER USE CASES THAT MIGHT BE FOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS. AND WE ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT CLEARED PRODUCTS AS WELL, ON THE LONGER TERM HORIZON. YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW. THE 20 CENTURY CURES ACT MAKES IT VERY CLEAR IF A PRODUCT IS INTENDED FOR A WELLNESS USE CASE, IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REGULATED BY THE FDA, SO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION BECOMES, DOES BLOOD PRESSURE HAVE WELLNESS INTENDED USE CASES? WE BELIEVE IT DOES. THERE IS AN AVALANCHE OF PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT BLOOD PRESSURE, NOT SURPRISINGLY, IS INFLUENCED AND INFLUENCES OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR WELLNESS. ED: -- CAROLINE: WHY CALL IT MEDICAL GRADE? WHY MARKETED THAT WAY? WILL: WE RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH THE DATA, AND A KEY DISTINGUISHING FACTOR IS THAT THE MG HAS A MEDICALLY CLEARED FEATURE ON IT. BOTH OF THOSE PRODUCTS HAVE A NUMBER OF WELLNESS FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH IT. ONE HAPPENS TO HAVE AN ECG MONITOR AS PART OF IT THAT CAN DETECT A FIB, AND BY THE WAY, WE SPENT TWO AND A HALF YEARS WORKING WITH THE FDA TO HAVE THAT BE A CLEAR FEATURE. THAT IS THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE BETWEEN THOSE TWO HARDWARE IS. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. IN THE APP, THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MEDICAL DISCLAIMERS EXPLAINING WHAT IS FOR WELLNESS AND WHAT IS FOR MEDICAL CAPABILITIES. ED: YOU HAVE SAID THIS IS A MISUNDERSTANDING. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? WILL YOU CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE FDA ON IT? IN THE BACKGROUND, ARE YOU TRYING TO REACH A SOLUTION? WILL: WE HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE FDA. WE HAVE ENGAGED THEM IN A LOT OF RECENT FEATURES OVER THE YEARS. WE WILL CONTINUE ENGAGING WITH THEM ON THAT. WE RESPONDED TO THE MORNING LETTER OUTLINING HOW WE FEEL ABOUT THIS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE. CAROLINE: THAT MUST CONTINUE TO TAKE UP HEADSPACE AND ULTIMATELY YOUR TIME. HOW DOES THAT IMPACT YOUR FUTURE PRODUCT ROADMAP? HOW DOES THIS AFFECT INNOVATION MORE BROADLY, DO YOU THINK? WILL: ULTIMATELY, I THINK INNOVATION HAS TO BE ABLE TO FLY IN THE UNITED STATES. WHOOP IS ONE OF THE FIRST WEARABLES IN THE WORLD THAT CAN MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE ACCURATELY FROM THE REST. THAT IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. IT IS ACCEPTED IN 50 OTHER MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT HERE IN THE U.S. THAT ALLOW COMPANIES TO INNOVATE AND TO OPERATE. WE HAVE PEOPLE USING THIS EVERY DAY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FEEDBACK OF MEMBERS, THEY LOVE THIS FEATURE. THEY TALK ABOUT HOW ACCURATE IT IS AND HOW IT IS HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND WELLNESS. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE EDUCATING THE FDA ON WHAT WE ARE DOING. ED: I'M VERY PRECIOUS THAT IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND OTHER FOOTBALL PLAYERS, IT IS VERY MUCH ON THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUS. IS THIS A GOOD MOVE FOR YOU TO FIGHT AMERICA'S REGULATOR? WILL: I THINK IN THE LONG RUN, WE WILL BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY, AND THAT COULD BE IN A VERY SHORT TIME. THE FIGHTING FOR AMERICANS ACCESS TO HEALTH DATA IS A GOOD THING TO DO. WHEN I FIRST STARTED, THE IDEA THAT I WOULD MEASURE SLEEP OR HEART RATE ACCURATELY FROM THE WRIST SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE. NOW WE ARE ABLE TO DO BLOOD PRESSURE ACCURATELY FROM THE WRIST. THAT IS A REALLY BIG DEAL AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE CELEBRATED. AS LONG AS THERE ARE THE RIGHT GUIDELINES AND EDUCATION IN PLACE FOR MEMBERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE IT -- THAT IS WHAT WE GET OUT OF IT. CAROLINE: GREAT CONVERSATION TO ROUND OUT WHAT IS THE END OF THIS EDITION OF BLOOMBERG TECH. PROGRAMMING NOTE. CHECK OUT THE NEXT EDITION OF BLOOMBERG TECH EUROPE. HOW A HAS CHANGED THE WAY WE WORK. ED: AND GIVEN 20 SECONDS I DID NOT EXPECT, WE HAVE A PROTEST -- A PODCAST YOU CAN FIND ON THE INTERNET AND THE BLOOMBERG PLATFORMS. YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO IT TO RECAP THE SHOW. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECH. \u266a",
