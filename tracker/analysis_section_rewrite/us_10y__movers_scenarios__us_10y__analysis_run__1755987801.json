      "feedback": "Your draft needs tighter causal logic, richer macro‑linkage, and sharper probability calibration. 1) Merge the Q3 earnings beat and Ultra C wb ramp into a single “Q3 earnings & product launch” driver, citing the 36 % share‑price surge and 49.4 % gross margin (SK994CBWR) to justify a 75 % upside probability. 2) Add a Fed‑rate‑cut upside trigger for Q3 (Fed policy meeting in October 2025) with a 60 % probability, citing Powell’s optimism (SK994CBWR). 3) Replace the generic “Fed rate hike” down‑side with a concrete “Fed hike in Q4 2025” risk, citing the CPI 2.7 % rise (LZG5YWQMC) and its impact on growth‑heavy equities (V7GV8YBQU), assigning a 55 % probability. 4) Expand the China export‑control risk to include the 2025 policy change (FOM34PUWA) and the potential 30 % cut in Chinese orders, assigning a 45 % probability. 5) Include UAS job‑growth data as a secondary upside catalyst (FOM34PUWA) with a 50 % probability. 6) Ensure each line is a single sentence, uses only in‑text IDs for specific facts, and avoids generic phrasing. 7) Re‑calculate the base‑case valuation to reflect the new upside/downside probabilities, citing the $34.76 share price (SK994CBWR). 8) Finally, verify that all critical sources are cited and reconcile any conflicting margin figures.",
