      "feedback": "The draft mixes equity‑centric and macro‑rate themes but fails to anchor each view to a canonical handle with a clear causal chain; revise each line to explicitly link the driver to a handle (e.g., “Fed September 25‑bp cut → 10‑yr/2‑yr spread → S&P 500” with (U21K4ALYQ)(LF0UUL917)(FAN5RYW6T)), and ensure the catalyst window is dated (25‑26 Sep for the cut, 15 Sep core PCE, 31 Sep NFP); remove the generic “Strong Q3 tech earnings season” line because it lacks a handle and catalyst, replacing it with a concrete trigger such as “Q3 tech earnings beat expectations → DXY decline → S&P 500 lift” citing (FAN5RYW6T)(B1KYJ1GPU); tighten probabilities to reflect evidence (e.g., 60% for the cut‑driven upside, 55% for the tech‑sector downside, 40% for the Fed‑delay risk) and add a brief invalidation scenario for each (e.g., “Fed cuts earlier than expected → upside invalidated”); finally, ensure each line is a single sentence, remove filler, and add inline (ID) citations for all factual claims.",
