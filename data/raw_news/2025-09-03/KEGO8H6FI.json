Launched in 2020, the platform lets investors place bets on a number of events, such as political phenomena, economic news, sports, entertainment, etc., using cryptocurrency.\nX, owned by the billionaire tycoon Elon Musk, is easily the most popular social media platform among the crypto community. While the community has hoped for years for X to directly integrate crypto payments into its social platform, it can certainly live with this step forward for now.\nMusk himself has often touted cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin as useful tools in the modern economy. His electric vehicle company Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) holds 11,509 BTC on its balance sheet that is worth $1.2 billion at the time of writing. The company even offered crypto payments for a while but abandoned the program after a while back in 2021.\nMusk, who successfully backed Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential election, had also hailed the prediction markets, in reference to Polymarket, for being \"more accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line.\"\nEven though the tycoon and the president are now having a public feud, the announcement sent the crypto community into a state of frenzy.\nU.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken was rather surprised: \"Ayo?!!!\"\nThe crypto payment service MoonPay reacted: \"POLYMARKET FOR THE WIN.\"\nPopular NFT series Pudgy Penguins wondered: \"So you\u2019re saying we\u2019ll be able to gamble on the Trump/Elon twitter fight?\""

Earlier in the year, \"Yes\" shares traded at significantly lower levels, with markets initially ranging between 30\u00a2 and 50\u00a2.\nMore news on Polymarket:\nBy entering before the announcement, \"romanticpaul\" was able to take advantage of the gap between the uncertain prices of their \"Yes\" contracts and the final payout of $1.\nWell-placed bet on engagement\nGiven that, after the announcement, every \"Yes\" contract pays $1 if it is correct, purchasing hundreds of contracts offers near-100% upside.\nThis very well-timed bet compensated \"romanticpaul\" once the market exploded towards certainty after the engagement was revealed.\nThe victory shows that prediction markets like Polymarket can reward traders who follow through with conviction or an initial signal, particularly within a rapid news cycle where prices can move quickly in response to mainstream confirmation.\nAll told, the Swift-Kelce market had more than $385,000 in traded volume with speculators and fans.\nFor \"romanticpaul\", the celebrity engagement was not merely gossip \u2014 it was a well-placed bet, raking in thousands in return.\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 27, 2025, where it first appeared in the MARKETS section.

      "text": "What is Crypto? Cryptocurrency explained originally appeared on TheStreet.\nYour paycheck already buys less than it did three years ago because the recent years inflation spike quietly eroded the real value of savings. Yet 1.4 billion adults still have no bank account at all, locking them out of the traditional system. Those who do send money abroad lose an average 6.62% in fees every time.\nCentral banks feel the pressure, too, 86% are now exploring their own digital currencies. Wall Street just moved in as well. After the SEC green-lit spot-Bitcoin ETFs on Jan 10. 2024, investors have funnelled more than $49 billion into them.\nIn short, crypto is no longer a niche experiment, it's leading the conversation on inflation hedging, financial inclusion, and institutional flows. But what is crypto exactly? Let\u2019s dive in.\nJoin the discussion with Scott Melker on Roundtable here.\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\nThink of cryptocurrency as internet-native money. Instead of paper bills or a bank database, every coin is simply an entry on a public record called a blockchain.\nEach time coins move, the transaction is bundled into a \u201cblock\u201d and chained, in order, to everything that came before, making the history permanent and tamper-resistant.\nBecause this ledger is copied to thousands of computers worldwide, no single company, government or hacker can change it unilaterally.\nWhy do people care?\nBut why should you care? There are three basic reasons:\nFirst, it\u2019s open all day, every day: The network never closes, so a transfer at two a.m. settles in minutes, not the two-day window common for bank wires.\nSecond, lower fees: Moving value directly between users often costs less than traditional wire or card rails.\nThird, it\u2019s borderless: A user in Brazil can send crypto to another user in Germany without currency conversion or correspondent banks.\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\nHow to get exposure?\nHow to get exposure you ask? You have three starting points:\nFirst is spot-Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs: Tickers like IBIT or ETHA sit in ordinary brokerage accounts and trade at stock-market hours.\nSecond is crypto exchanges: These are online platforms where you can buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Just make sure to choose firms that comply with U.S. or EU regulations.\nThird is hot and cold wallets: This is where the true ownership and self custody lies. Keep in mind that you are 100% responsible for your cryptocurrencies at this stage. It's the most advanced form of ownership and you must keep your private keys, which is the secret code that proves ownership, very safe."
