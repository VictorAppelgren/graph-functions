      "text": "When it comes to digital engagement, there\u2019s a lot at stake for credit unions. As detailed in \u201cHow Credit Union Innovation Can Drive Gen Z Engagement,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence report created in collaboration with Velera (formerly PSCU/Co-op Solutions), a growing percentage of Gen Z consumers are transitioning into higher-paying jobs and more rewarding career paths, meaning they will likely soon be spending more on big-ticket purchases, including automobiles and homes.\nTo reach them, a personal touch will be essential. Credit unions (CUs) have the advantage of personalization \u2014 and a receptive audience \u2014 to deepen their digital relationships with a broad range of members, Jeremiah Lotz, senior vice president, product and data experience at Velera, told PYMNTS.\nThe conversation took place as part of the continuing \u201cWhat\u2019s Next in Payments\u201d series focused on how companies have been reinventing their digital efforts to connect with consumers.\nWhen it comes to the digital engagement credit unions have with their end users, he said, it\u2019s not just about how often they\u2019re logging on, but how members are interacting with those CUs, and how effective the financial institution is in serving the needs of those digitally-minded consumers.\n\u201cOne of the biggest measurements we look at is: Was a consumer able to complete something that they expected, and then how did they feel about that experience as they went through that process?\u201d he said.\nWith analysis and digital insight that extends well beyond simply keeping tabs on logins and clicks of digital buttons, a holistic view begins to emerge as to how successful the credit union\u2019s outreach has been \u2014 and how things can be improved.\nIf the credit unions are able to serve the needs of their various markets quickly and intuitively, said Lotz, \u201cthat\u2019s how you\u2019re going to capture the long-term digital users.\u201d\nTaking Stock of Different Demographics\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to digital engagement, he said. The right digital experience means different things to different demographics, said Lotz, but there\u2019s growth across the board in all age groups.\nThe conventional wisdom might hold that younger generations may be naturally more digitally-savvy than older cohorts. The fact is, though, that even older credit union members, boomers among them, have found value in taking more of their daily financial lives online, having been primed by ordering food and groceries through various apps and platforms to get things done with digital devices.\nIn short, he said, \u201call generations have had higher demand, and higher expectations, of digital capabilities\u201d from their financial institutions. \u201cEvery generation is asking for new functions and new features, and even providing information through the digital channels that maybe we didn\u2019t expect a few years ago when it comes to applying for credit cards and loans, for example.\u201d\nImproving the Outreach\nThe stage is set, then, for credit unions to capitalize on the advantages they already have with their members \u2014 and those advantages lie with personalization and collaboration. With the credit union service organization (CUSO) model in place, through Velera, data sharing and a wholesale embrace of technology through a central point of contact can help all CUs, Lotz said.\n\u201cBy leveraging that consortium data and information across the credit union \u2014 we provide a best-in-class experience regardless of the FI [financial institution] they are with,\u201d he said. In the meantime, CUs can make decisions more quickly and can even streamline the credit approval process. Artificial intelligence (AI) is being leveraged to help CUs offer even more intuitive and advanced decision-making and innovations extended to their end users. The same transaction level and account-level data that\u2019s shared throughout the organization can be used to personalize experiences so that CUs can anticipate the next product or service that can be extended to the individual for consideration. A reminder that the member\u2019s car payment or mortgage payment is due can \u2014 based on the individual\u2019s background and data \u2014 help educate them that an extra $100 paydown on the loan can help save on interest and other fees down the line.\nIt\u2019s a proactive approach rather than a reactive one, said Lotz \u2014 one that results in the member logging on not just to get basic banking done, but to ask, as Lotz put it, \u201cWhat is my FI going to tell me today \u2014 and what is it going to direct me to in order to make my financial situation better?\u201d"

      "text": "Innovation has emerged as a key factor in determining whether credit unions can thrive in a competitive, rapidly evolving financial ecosystem. As expectations from consumers and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) shift toward digital convenience and tailored experiences, not-for-profit financial institutions face growing pressure to modernize, not just to compete with traditional banks, but to remain relevant.\nThe Innovation Readiness Index (IRI) \u2014 which measures the degree to which credit unions\u2019 current and future portfolios of financial products and features align with their members\u2019 preferences \u2014 reveals that top performers are surging ahead not just by offering more features, but by aligning closely with member expectations. These leaders have increased their consumer innovation readiness by 13% over the past two years. They are now 49% closer to delivering the complete suite of financial products and features their members want.\nBut it\u2019s not just about building more \u2014 it\u2019s about building smarter. Innovation must be targeted, data-informed and aligned with member expectations. For instance, Gen Z consumers rank digital onboarding 78% higher in importance than the average consumer. And even as more than 1 in 2 current members still prefer in-person interactions, nearly half of recent defectors say a lack of digital tools factored into their decision to leave. These contrasting signals underscore a critical truth: These institutions must balance their legacy strengths with future-facing capabilities.\nInside \u201cThe 2025 Credit Union Innovation Readiness Index: Closing Gaps, Winning Members\u201d\n- Discover how innovation and partnerships are redefining success for credit unions\n- Learn how digital expectations are shifting \u2014 and where credit unions must catch up\n- Explore why small businesses remain an overlooked growth opportunity\n- Gain insight into why Gen Z is the next frontier for growth\nTop-performing credit unions are not just keeping up \u2014 they\u2019re pulling ahead. With innovation readiness scores as high as 73 (compared to 34 for bottom-tier performers), the Innovation Readiness Index reveals how these institutions are outpacing expectations by embedding innovation into their strategy, not just checking boxes.\nAbout the Index\n\u201cThe 2025 Credit Union Innovation Readiness Index: Closing Gaps, Winning Members,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence and Velera collaboration, examines how credit unions can reap the benefits of digital innovation to gain members and reduce churn. The index is based on three surveys. First, a survey of 500 credit union executives was conducted from Feb. 6 to April 14, 2025, to learn about their current product and feature offerings as well as their plans for future innovation. A second, census-balanced survey of 15,758 U.S. consumers investigated the products and features consumers want and expect from credit unions, conducted from Feb. 28 to March 31, 2025. We also surveyed 1,996 SMBs from Feb. 26 to March 27, 2025, on the products and features they want and expect from credit unions."

      "text": "In the battle to keep customers and attract new ones, open banking is a key differentiator for credit unions, propelling top performers ahead while many others lag, potentially missing a pathway to member satisfaction.\n\u201cThe 2025 Credit Union Innovation Readiness Index: Closing Gaps, Winning Members,\u201d a June report produced in collaboration between Velera and PYMNTS Intelligence, underscores innovation as a defining factor for credit union success.\nFacing shifting expectations from both consumers and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) toward digital convenience and tailored experiences, credit unions must modernize not just to compete with traditional banks, but to remain relevant to their members. The report, based surveys of 500 credit union executives, 15,000 U.S. consumers, and nearly 2,000 SMBs, measures the degree to which credit unions\u2019 current and future product and feature portfolios align with their members\u2019 preferences.\nThe responses show that innovation must be targeted, data-informed and aligned with member expectations. That data, permissioned to banks to share with partners to develop apps and other features, can personalize everything from budgeting tools to loan offers. Open banking can also help CUs fine tune their cross-channel experiences. As more than 1 in 2 current members still prefer in-person interactions, nearly half of recent defectors say a lack of digital tools factored into their decision to leave. These contrasting signals underscore a critical truth: These institutions must balance their legacy strengths with future-facing capabilities.\nTop-performing credit unions are surging ahead not merely by offering more features. The leaders have significantly increased their consumer innovation readiness by 13% over the past two years, and the readiness includes open banking.\n- 85.6% of top-performing credit unions currently offer open banking, in stark contrast to just 12.9% of bottom performers. This represents a gap in foundational digital capabilities.\n- Gen Z consumers are 72% more likely than the average consumer to value open banking, signaling its importance for attracting younger demographics and future market relevance.\n- Small businesses that have recently switched away from a credit union are 168% more likely than average to desire open banking, indicating a significant role in member retention and avoiding churn among business clients.\nDespite a noticeable shift toward digital channels, traditional branch services remain valued, with 51% of both consumers and SMB credit union members still preferring in-person interactions. However, this preference is balanced by a strong gravitational pull toward digital solutions among key segments: 68% of SMBs who recently switched from a credit union to another financial institution express a clear preference for online onboarding when applying for new products, which in turn can be fashioned through permissioned data. The \u201cswitching sentiment\u201d is echoed by 48% of consumers and 52% of millennials who switched.\nOpen banking, of course, is tied to joint efforts between financial institutions and FinTechs. We found that success can hinge on the nature of external partnerships, with 79% of all credit unions citing them as instrumental for fostering faster and broader innovation.\nTop performers strategically leverage these collaborations to gain speed and scale, whereas less innovative credit unions often depend on partners to acquire fundamental digital capabilities they currently lack."

  "argos_summary": "Velera urges credit unions to prioritize digital tools, personalization, and authentic storytelling to attract Gen Z members, who value omnichannel engagement, AI-driven guidance, and open banking. The company cites a Velera-Mastercard study showing Gen Z is 78% more likely to seek digital onboarding and 72% more likely to value open banking. Velera argues that credit unions can leverage their trust and community strengths by adding new capabilities to meet Gen Z where they are, aiming to deepen digital relationships and capture long\u2011term digital users.",
