      "feedback": "This draft has a solid core: a plausible base-case link among macro regime, policy easing, AI-capex optics, and durable cash flows (Ford, Schlumberger, Intel signal, MSFT/Shopify, UNH/LULU), with plausible near‑term catalysts (Fed guidance in Sept, 10Y/yield path, tariff truce) and a coherent long-horizon framing. However, the causal chain is underdeveloped, several sources are misapplied or extraneous, and the piece lacks discipline in numbers, scenario structure, and cross‑topic synthesis. Actionable edits: 1) fix the topology into a concise base-case narrative that foregrounds first-principles discounting under Regime A—inflation normalization with higher discount rates compresses long-duration growth, but easing financial conditions lift AI capex and durable cash flows; tie each pillar to explicit market transmission (rates, FX/dollar, yields, equity multiples) and anchor claims to the four cited IDs after each sentence. 2) tighten numeric anchoring from sources: Ford—5% yield, forward P/E ~10x, Q2 EV losses ~$1.3B, F-Series leadership (22PL3Q360); policy—September cut 25–50bp, 10Y mid-4%, softer dollar (GX057ADL7); 2025 ACMR economics—revenue midpoint ~ $900m, gross margins ~ low single digits (22PL3Q360); oil—IEA 2025 non-OPEC supply growth ~2.5 mbpd vs softer demand (J99EM2TPZ); tariffs—90‑day tariff truce extension (RHXDOHQQX); Intel governance signal—10% stake with implied value ~$11B (GX057ADL7). 3) prune irrelevant strands (urban crime dynamics) unless you can tie them to a direct price/volatility channel; reframe or drop them. 4) develop a clean scenario tree with 2–3 paths and quantified implications: base-case with Fed easing and soft dollar; a policy-tightening impulse that lifts yields toward the upper end of the mid-4% band; a tariff-truce expiry or tariff shock that pressures margins—state triggers and invalidation criteria for each. 5) quantify sensitivities: translate the regime/FX/rate paths into expected P/E or ROIC shifts, margin trajectories for Ford and ACMR, and AI-capex spend growth under each path. 6) deliver a single, tight cross-topic synthesis sentence, then a crisp watch-list of decisive signals (Fed guidance in Sept; 10Y yield trajectory; dollar direction; tariff-truce expiry; Intel stake progress) with explicit timing windows; 7) ensure every factual claim is tied to one of GX057ADL7, 22PL3Q360, J99EM2TPZ, or RHXDOHQQX and place citations immediately after the related claim to avoid ambiguity; 8) rewrite for brevity and readability, breaking long sentences into 1–2 clauses and aligning with SECTION FOCUS by foregrounding macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals in a single, coherent chain.",
