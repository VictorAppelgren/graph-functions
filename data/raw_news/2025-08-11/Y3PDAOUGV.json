  "content": "Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in Central Harlem has grown to 90 cases, including three deaths.\n\nThe update comes days after New York City\u2019s health department proposed new regulations for the testing of cooling towers, which they suspect are linked to the outbreak.\n\nCooling towers are rooftop devices that release mist into the air as they cool large buildings. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn\u2019t properly disinfected, Legionella bacteria can grow and infect people who inhale the mist.\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson told CNN the proposed rules \u201cwere in development well before the Legionnaires\u2019 cluster in Central Harlem.\u201d\n\nUnder New York City law, building owners are responsible for registering and maintaining their cooling towers and they\u2019re routinely inspected for compliance. The proposal would set specific time periods for testing and require test sampling be conducted by state-certified labs. It also details monetary penalties for noncompliance, although the posted documents didn\u2019t specify amounts. Currently, building owners who fail to follow routine maintenance rules face fines of $500 to $2,000.\n\nThe proposed changes to testing and fines, however, may come with the challenge of enforcement \u2014 city data shows that the city conducted a record low number of inspections in 2024, with less than half the inspections of 2017, when inspection numbers were first recorded. The decline in inspections was first reported by Gothamist.\n\nThe current Legionnaires\u2019 cluster was first announced on July 25. Health officials say all operable cooling towers in the area have been tested, and those that tested positive for Legionella were ordered to be cleaned. The department said it confirmed that the required cleanings were carried out.\n\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.",

      "text": "Inspections for the Legionella bacteria in New York City\u2019s cooling towers sank to a record post-pandemic low in the months leading up to an outbreak of the disease in East Harlem that has so far killed three people, according to a Gothamist analysis of publicly available health data.\nA spokesperson for the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene blamed a staffing shortage for the decline.\nThe agency has the authority to test water in cooling towers and issue violations to owners who fail to comply with prevention measures. After a Legionnaires' outbreak that sickened 138 people and killed 16 a decade ago, city law requires building owners to test for Legionella bacteria every three months.\nIn 2017, the first year of inspections, the agency inspected 5,200 cooling towers and issued over 48,000 violations to building owners.\nThis year, the department is on track to complete less than half that number of inspections \u2013 just 1,167 as of June, according to data provided by the health department. It\u2019s a record low, not counting 2020 and 2021, when the pandemic disrupted city services. And the number of violations this year is set to hit an all-time low. As of April, the department only issued 269.\nThe data also shows year after year of declining enforcement. After rebounding to 4,400 inspections in 2022, the agency has conducted between 22% and 30% fewer inspections and issued fewer violations each year.\nChantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the decrease in inspections was due to a lack of inspectors at the agency. She did not respond to questions about the severity of the shortage.\nThe current outbreak that started in late July has sickened 73 people, three of them fatal.\nThe 2017 laws require building owners to register cooling towers and inspect for Legionella bacteria. The law, however, does not indicate how often the city must carry out its own inspections.\nCooling tower inspections, according to city experts, are a critical defense against outbreaks of the deadly disease.\nActing Health Commissioner Michelle Morse told WNYC on Wednesday that the ability to inspect cooling towers after the outbreak helped the city stop the disease's spread in Harlem. However, she did not elaborate on whether more regular inspections could have prevented the outbreak.\n\u201cFrom my perspective, there is of course always more that we can do to advance our prevention efforts, and this is why investing in public health is so important,\u201d she said.\nA review of cooling tower registration and inspection data shows that about 1,900 of the 4,928 registered towers in the city have not been inspected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene since 2023 and 85 have no record of inspection by the city.\nThose towers cool apartments and other large buildings by circulating water through air conditioning systems. The water returns to the cooling tower warm and is evaporated as vapor.\nWithout proper inspection and treatment, that warm water can become a hotbed for deadly Legionella bacteria. Inhaling infected vapor can lead to Legionnaires\u2019 disease, which causes cough, fever, chills, muscle aches and difficulty breathing."
