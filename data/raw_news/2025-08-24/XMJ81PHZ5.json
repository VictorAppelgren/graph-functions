  "description": "These products' love language is self-care.",
  "content": "A bottle of Being Frenshe scent mist that I swear by for fresh-smelling...everything. This works well for anyone who likes one-and-done products, as this can act as a body, hair, or even linen mist. Plus, all of Being Frenshe's products contain a mood-boosting scent technology, meaning it'll help you relax while you waft in your new fave scent.\n\nOr a reusable silk eye mask just in case a weighted eye mask feels like too much pressure for you. This helps to block out light while feeling super plush and soft against your delicate eye area.\n\nbefore shaving (like a shaving cream) to help create a smoother razor glide across the skin. Oh, and it smells just like the brand's beloved An Eos vanilla cashmere shave oil so that you can up the luxe vibes of your #EverythingShower! Apply this shave oilshaving (like a shaving cream) to help create a smoother razor glide across the skin. Oh, and it smells just like the brand's beloved vanilla cashmere body lotion \u2014 warm vanilla, soft musk, and cozy caramel galore!\n\nknow you had your eight hours of self-care beauty rest. This lightweight yet nourishing oil contains 1% Granactive Retinoid that helps to smooth and clear skin. And aside from its gorg blue color, it's also packed with antioxidant-rich blueberry extract! An E.l.f. Blue-ty sleep oil packed with ingredients that'll let peopleyou had your eight hours of self-care beauty rest. This lightweight yet nourishing oil contains 1% Granactive Retinoid that helps to smooth and clear skin. And aside from its gorg blue color, it's also packed with antioxidant-rich blueberry extract!\n\nA luxurious leave-on lip mask to say goodbye to chapped lips once and for all. This mask is like a blast of hydration, containing a trio of hyaluronic acid, castor seed oil, and squalene to create plump, pillowy puckers. This will help moisturize your lips while you snooze away or whenever you feel dryness coming on!\n\nA pair of exfoliating gloves because they are the easiest way to get rid of ingrown hairs or start your journey toward smoother, more radiant skin. Instead of awkwardly trying to loofah hard-to-reach areas, try these gloves that are as easy to use as gliding your hands across your skin.\n\nAn Eva NYC therapy session mask that will seriously help heal your hair health (like a therapy sesh for your hair, hence the name). Shiny strands rely on hair health, and hair health relies on a balance of moisture and protein. This mask has both argan oil to seal hydration into the hair and plant proteins to help heal broken bonds.\n\nA box of sleep earplugs since personal care means doing anything to ensure you get eight hours of sleep. If you share a bed with a loud snorer, or simply live on a bustling street, these earplugs will help block out noise so that you can sleep alllll throughout the night.\n\nAn ESW Beauty sheet mask duo set that comes with one matcha almond milk mask and one vanilla oat milk mask to help soothe dull, dry skin! This is a must if, despite your go-to hydrating skincare routine, you still need a little boost of glow in your week.\n\nAnd a micellar water for the first step in your nighttime skincare routine \u2014 removing your makeup. This micellar water is great because it removes ALL makeup, including waterproof mascara! And the best part? Micellar water only removes impurities, meaning it's nonstripping and generally great for those with dry skin.",

It\u2019s a good size to pack a few gym outfits, and I love how there is a separate pocket for my running shoes, so when I do outdoor workouts, it doesn\u2019t dirty the inside of my bag. The shoulder strap is really comfortable and stretchy on my shoulder.\" \u2014Kimm\nGet it from Lululemon for $158 (available in two colors).\n21. A reviewer-loved gym bag sporting (pun intended) over 8K 5-star reviews, a plastic-lined zipper area for wet clothes, outside pockets for your water bottle, and a bottom zip-out area for shoes. Simply, it has it all without bankrupting you from paying for the actual gym. \ud83d\ude09\nPromising review: \"This is my new go-to gym bag! I ordered the medium beige. I am a nurse and like to work out before my shift starts in the morning; this bag has a slot to hold everything I need to get ready for my shift at the gym. I love that there\u2019s a separate slot for your wet clothes, dry clothes, and shoes; that way, all stuff can still be organized and not be mixed together! The bag itself is easy to clean. I absolutely love the color, although deciding which one to go with was hard. Definitely worth it for the price !\" \u2014Lisa\nGet it from Amazon for $25.98+ (available in two sizes and 17 colors).\n22. A Stanley All Day Carry-All bag designed specifically to hold your emotional support 40-oz tumbler, your phone, and your license \u2014 aka everything you need if you're not quite a Gym Rat but like to pop in and out of a Zumba class from time to time. No need to even visit the locker room when you've got everything you need riiiiiiight here (picture me lovingly patting my crossbody bag, hehe).\nThis is what I take when heading to the gym! I'm not someone who needs all that much, just something to clip my keys to, some water, my phone, and my license (so I can drive there, duh). I toss my headphones around my neck, and I'm good to go, thanks to this handy-dandy crossbody!\nPromising review: \"Very convenient for carrying! It does exactly what it was designed to do. Love it! It actually fits 30- or 40-oz cups. It's just looser, but it still works. If there were a negative, it would be the cost, but it's quality and convenient, so I paid it.\" \u2014Miss CEECEE\nGet it from Amazon for $38+ (available in eight colors and two sizes).\n23. A Calpak Luka duffel bag that'll offer plenty of space for everything from your your fav workout outfit to your towel to shower off after getting sweaty. Plus, it's got a separate compartment for your stinky sneakers.\n24. Or a Calpak gym bag to hold your yoga mat, a large water bottle, and protein powder container. And it's stylish to boot!\n25. A waterproof drawstring gym backpack because it'll keep your hands free as you trek to and fro Zumba class.\n26. A Baggu nylon backpack that'll be perfect for holding your gym essentials or whatever you need for your next adventure. It's even got a laptop sleeve in case you want to also use it for school or work.\n27. A lightweight backpack that has allll the space and pockets you could possibly need despite its surprisingly small size. If a phone pocket, 20-liter capacity, laptop and iPad compartment, multiple storage pockets, and more aren't enough for your gym bag.... you may want to reevaluate what you're planning to work out.\n28. A packable hiking daypack available in a 24-L version that can ACTUALLY fit in your pocket when it's folded up. When unfolded, this will be your next lightweight travel BFF.\n29. An Osprey day pack that you'll be delighted by, on account of just how many knickknacks you can stuff in here and still feel like you're wearing nothing on your back.\n30. A Carhartt mini backpack you'll realize is almost too functional the moment you're digging around in it to find your keys.\nSome reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity."
