  "content": "Below is Validea's guru fundamental report for DOORDASH INC (DASH). Of the 22 guru strategies we follow, DASH rates highest using our P/B Growth Investor model based on the published strategy of Partha Mohanram. This growth model looks for low book-to-market stocks that exhibit characteristics associated with sustained future growth.\n\nDOORDASH INC (DASH) is a large-cap growth stock in the Business Services industry. The rating using this strategy is 77% based on the firm\u2019s underlying fundamentals and the stock\u2019s valuation. A score of 80% or above typically indicates that the strategy has some interest in the stock and a score above 90% typically indicates strong interest.\n\nThe following table summarizes whether the stock meets each of this strategy's tests. Not all criteria in the below table receive equal weighting or are independent, but the table provides a brief overview of the strong and weak points of the security in the context of the strategy's criteria.\n\nAbout Partha Mohanram: Sometimes the best investing strategies don't come from the world of investing. Sometimes research that changes the investing world can come from the halls of academia. Partha Mohanram is a great example of this. While academic research has shown that value investing works over time, it has found the opposite for growth investing. Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Growth firms, on average, do not beat the market over time, but Mohanram identified eight criteria that can be used to separate the winners from the losers. His criteria are split into three distinct groups. His model looks at profitability using criteria like return on assets and cash flow from operations, consistency using the variance of return on assets and sales, and a willingness to invest for the future using capital expenditures, advertising and research and development. He found that, when combined together, these criteria helped to identify growth firms that are likely to sustain that growth."

As a result, they do not incorporate any commissions or other trading costs or fees.

The back-tested performance results shown are hypothetical and are not the result of real-time management of actual accounts.
