  "content": "The all-new iPhone 17 Air will likely be the standout device at Apple's September \"Awe Dropping\" event, but the iPhone 17 Pro isn't exactly getting left behind. There are design updates and new features coming, and we've outlined everything we know so far below.\n\nThe \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c models will come in the same two sizes as the iPhone 16 Pro models: 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches. While the front will look similar with no visible changes to the display, the rear of the device will be redesigned.\n\nRather than a titanium frame for the \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c models, Apple is going back to aluminum, and also doing away with some of the glass. There will be a part-aluminum part-glass design, and the back of the iPhone won't have an all-glass look.\n\n\n\nRenders and dummy models suggest that there will be a glass area around the MagSafe charger and Apple logo, while the rest of the frame will be made from aluminum for enhanced durability.\n\nApple is also redesigning the camera bump and instead of a square-shaped bump at the left, there will be a rectangular camera bar. Camera lenses will still be arranged in a triangle shape at the left, but the flash and LiDAR sensor will be moved to the right, and the bump will take up most of the width of the \u200ciPhone\u200c. As part of the camera change, Apple could shift the Apple logo on the back of the \u200ciPhone\u200c further down.\n\nThere may also be some tweaks to the antenna system. The little antenna lines could wrap around the rear camera bump, improving 5G connectivity. Apple is designing its own Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip this year, so the updated antenna could be how Apple makes improvements to efficiency. There's also a chance there won't be antenna lines on the bottom of the \u200ciPhone\u200c, but this is a change most users won't notice.\n\nThe \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c models might be just a little thicker than the current models, coming in at 8.725mm thick instead of 8.25mm thick. The increased space could be used for a larger battery.\n\n\u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c colors could be a little unusual this year. There have been multiple rumors suggesting that Apple is going with an \"orange\" color, which may actually turn out to be more of a copper shade. It sounds like it will be more bold than Apple's traditional shades of gold. We're also expecting a dark blue and the standard black, white, and gray options.\n\nThe \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c models are expected to have the same OLED display as the \u200ciPhone 16 Pro\u200c models, but there could be a change to the protective glass. Apple has been developing a more durable anti-reflective display option.\n\nIt could cut down on reflections without notably impacting the visibility of the \u200ciPhone\u200c's screen, and it might also be more resistant to scratches and drops. It's supposedly not quite like the nano-texture display that Apple uses for Macs and iPads, because the \u200ciPhone\u200c's display will still have a glossy appearance.\n\nSupposedly the new display coating process is more scratch resistant than the Ceramic Shield that Apple uses for the \u200ciPhone 16 Pro\u200c models.\n\nApple designed a new A19 Pro chip for the \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c models, which is built using TSMC's latest 3-nanometer process. We're not expecting a huge jump in performance, but it'll be faster and more efficient than the A18 Pro.\n\nApple is going to use a metal-covered battery and a vapor chamber cooling system to improve heat dissipation in the \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c models, and that could provide further chip speed enhancements.\n\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to include 12GB RAM, up from 8GB in the \u200ciPhone 16 Pro\u200c models.\n\nThe \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c could be a bit thicker than the \u200ciPhone 16 Pro\u200c, providing more space for a bigger battery. Battery life could see an improvement, and Apple is rumored to be using a battery over 5,000mAh for the first time.\n\nQi 2.2 support is expected for all of the \u200ciPhone 17\u200c models, so the \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c and Pro Max will charge at 25W on compatible Qi 2.2 accessories. That's the same speed as \u200cMagSafe\u200c, but accessory manufacturers are still adjusting to Qi 2 and will now need to come out with a whole new line of Qi 2.2 chargers.\n\nThere's a major change to the camera design, and there's likely some reason behind it. The \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c models will have an updated 48-megapixel Telephoto lens, which means all three lenses will be 48 megapixels for the first time.\n\nSome rumors have suggested the new Telephoto lens will support up to 8x optical zoom (possibly only on the Pro Max), and the Main camera could possibly have an adjustable aperture. Apple is planning on a dual video recording feature that uses the front and rear camera simultaneously, and there will be an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nApple may also add 8K video recording for the first time.\n\nRumors about \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c pricing have been mixed due to tariff unknowns. Apple is paying out upwards of $1 billion on tariffs in its September quarter, and that cost could be passed to consumers.\n\nThere could be a price increase, though Apple might limit it to the \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c. If that's the case, the \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c could be $50 more expensive, but it might also come with 256GB of storage as a minimum, up from 128GB.\n\nYou can read more about what to expect from the \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c in our dedicated iPhone 17 Pro roundup.",

      "text": "MagSafe is now a universal name that Apple uses for both iPhone and Mac charging. There are MagSafe charging pucks for the iPhone, and MagSafe 3 charging ports and cables for Apple's Macs. The two MagSafe capabilities aren't related, but Apple is using the same MagSafe terminology for all of its latest charging technology.\nMagSafe for Mac\nApple reintroduced MagSafe for the Mac with the launch of the 2021 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, and we can expect to see MagSafe roll out across the Mac lineup.\nMagSafe for Mac is not a new technology, and it was previously used starting in 2012. MagSafe, as the name suggests, uses magnets to connect a charger to a charging port on the Mac, with the idea that if a MagSafe cable is pulled, it disconnects safely without pulling the MacBook down from wherever it might be resting.\nApple swapped from MagSafe to USB-C in 2016, but at this point, the Mac's power needs have exceeded what's possible with USB-C, so Apple needed another solution, and that solution was a return to MagSafe charging.\nHow MagSafe for Mac Works\nThe new iteration of MagSafe for Mac is officially known as MagSafe 3, and it works exactly like the previous MagSafe implementation. There's a small rectangular magnet-topped charging connector that fits into the five-pin charging slot, with the magnets securing the fit.\nThere's a USB-C port at the other end of the charging cable that is meant to plug into a power adapter to power the Mac.\nMaximum Charging Power\nApple transitioned to MagSafe largely for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which is now able to charge at up to 140W, a charging speed not supported by USB-C cables.\nWhen a MagSafe to USB-C cable is paired with the 140W USB-C Power Adapter that comes with the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the MacBook Pro can be charged at up to 140W, and it powers up quicker than it would with a USB-C based charging solution limited to 100W. 16-inch MacBook Pro models can still be charged with USB-C cables, but not at the full 140W.\nIt's only 16-inch MacBook Pro models that max out at 140W, but the 14-inch machines also use MagSafe charging for cohesiveness. The lower-end 14-inch machines ship with a 67W power adapter but can take advantage of a 96W power adapter, while the higher-end 14-inch machines ship with the 96W adapter.\nAvailability\nMagSafe 3 charging capabilities are available for the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models introduced in 2021 and the 2022 MacBook Air. The MagSafe 3 charging cables are not compatible with any other Macs, including older Macs that used MagSafe 2.\nMagSafe for iPhone\nApple also has MagSafe technology for the iPhone, but it works differently. Rather than magnets built into a specific charging area, Apple added a ring of magnets around the Qi-based wireless charging coils, which allows for a close fit and faster charging speeds. iPhone 12 and later models use the magnet ring to connect to accessories that also have magnets built inside, so it's not limited to just charging technology.\nCases are the same way, snapping onto the magnet ring built into the iPhone. The design of the magnet ring allows the iPhone 12 and later to be compatible with a whole range of accessories that rely on magnets, from chargers to mounts to cases.\nThe Magnet Ring in iPhones\niPhone 12, iPhone 13, and iPhone 14 models have a ring of 18 rectangular magnets arranged in a circular shape located underneath the wireless charging coil in each device, which is what allows the MagSafe magic to happen.\nOlder iPhones had the same wireless charging coil, but no magnets underneath to allow for magnetic connections.\nApple's MagSafe Charger\nThe MagSafe Charger looks something like a larger Apple Watch Charging Puck with an aluminum body and a soft white material at the top of the charger. The charger snaps onto an iPhone with magnets inside, perfectly aligning the charging coil in the MagSafe Charger with the charging coil in the iPhone.\nRepair site iFixit took apart a MagSafe Charger and did an x-ray to show us the charger\u2019s internal design. As with the iPhone, there are a series of magnets inside that are compatible with the magnets in the iPhone that surround an internal charging coil and a circuit board that manages the charging process.\nApple has also designed the MagSafe Duo Charger, which combines a MagSafe charger with an Apple Watch charging puck. The charger is foldable, making it ideal for travel, and costs $129.\nThe MagSafe Duo Charger is not able to charge a MagSafe iPhone at the full 15W. With Apple's 20W charger, the MagSafe Duo chargers at a maximum of 11W, and with a 27W or higher USB-C power adapter, it charges at up to 14W. The MagSafe Duo does not come with a power adapter and a charger must be purchased separately. Note that the 29W charger from Apple is not compatible, but the 30W version is.\n12W Charging iPhone 12 and 13 mini\nFor most of the iPhone 12 models, the MagSafe charger is able to charge at a maximum of 15W, but for the smallest iPhone, the iPhone 12 mini, charging maxes out at 12W. The same goes for the MagSafe Duo. Charging speeds can also be affected by the temperature of the iPhone.\nGetting 15W Charging Speeds\nAchieving 15W (or 12W on iPhone 12/13 mini) charging speeds requires Apple's 20W power adapter or another appropriate 20W+ PD 3.0 charger. Testing with Apple\u2019s prior-generation 18W iPad charger and a 96W MacBook Pro charger proved that those power adapters do not allow the MagSafe Charger to reach the full 15 watts.\nThe same goes for many existing third-party power adapters, which also do not have the proper charging profile. New chargers from third-party companies may, however, include support for the MagSafe Charger, and testing indicates that to provide the 15W charging speed, a MagSafe Charger needs to support Power Delivery 3.0 at 9V/2.22A or 9V/2.56A, according to Apple. The iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini can hit maximum charging speeds with a 9V/2.03A power adapter.\nYou're guaranteed to get 15W with Apple\u2019s $19 20W power adapter (this power adapter also comes with the 2020 iPad Air models), but you may also be able to use a third-party charger as long as it meets those specifications.\nMagSafe Charging vs. Traditional Charging\nWith the MagSafe Charger, it takes about an hour to charge an iPhone 12 from zero to 50 percent, which is double the time that it takes to charge using a USB-C to Lightning cable and a 20W+ USB-C power adapter.\nCharging with the MagSafe Charger is faster than charging with a Qi-based charger, which maxes out at 7.5W, but for the fastest charging you\u2019re still going to want to use a wired charging connection with a Lightning to USB-C cable.\nWhen the iPhone is warm, charging speeds can be throttled down, and Apple warns that if the iPhone gets too warm, charging will be limited above 80 percent. Apple recommends moving your iPhone and charger to a cooler location if it feels overly warm.\nCharging Speeds With Lightning Accessories\nWhen Lightning-based accessories like EarPods are connected to an iPhone 12 or later, charging with MagSafe is limited to 7.5W, which is something to be aware of.\nUsing the MagSafe Charger With Older iPhones\nUsing the MagSafe Charger with older iPhones is possible, but not recommended because charging is slower than with the 7.5W Qi-based chargers. Charging appears to be capped at right around 5W with the MagSafe Charger when paired with older devices, and in testing, the MagSafe charger has proven to be slower than using a plain old Qi charger.\nMagSafe vs. USB-C\nTesting suggests the MagSafe Charger charges a compatible iPhone less than half as fast than a wired 20W USB-C charger. With the 20W charger, a dead iPhone was able to charge to 50 percent in 28 minutes, and the same 50 percent charge took an hour over MagSafe.\nMagSafe Cases and Accessories\nApple has designed cases, wallet attachments, and a MagSafe Charger to use with the MagSafe iPhones, and third-party case and accessory makers are also creating MagSafe-compatible products. We have a guide highlighting some of the available MagSafe accessories that you can purchase.\nMagSafe Don'ts\n- Avoid putting single use cards like hotel cards against the magnet in the iPhone or the MagSafe Charger\n- Don\u2019t put credit cards, security badges, passports, or key fobs between the iPhone and MagSafe Charger because magnetic strips and RFID chips can be damaged\n- Don\u2019t charge with the MagSafe Wallet attachment on the iPhone (cases can remain on)\nMagSafe Charger Warnings\nWhen using the MagSafe Charger, Apple warns that it can leave an imprint on the Leather Cases designed for MagSafe iPhones, which is something to be aware of. It can also leave a mark on Silicone cases based on reports from MacRumors readers, and it\u2019s possible that this will affect third-party cases made from soft materials as well.\nApple recommends that those worried about the ring that can be caused by MagSafe choose Silicone or Clear cases instead of the Leather versions.\niPhone MagSafe and Pacemakers\nLike all iPhones, the iPhone 12 and 13 models with their MagSafe technology can cause interference with medical devices like pacemakers and defibrillators. Apple recommends keeping iPhone 12 models and all MagSafe accessories a safe distance away from implanted medical devices.\nA safe distance is considered more than 6 inches / 15 cm apart or more than 12 inches / 30 cm apart if wirelessly charging. Though there are more magnets in the iPhone 12/13/14 models, Apple says that they are \"not expected to pose a greater risk of magnetic interference to medical devices than prior iPhone models.\"\nGuide Feedback\nHave questions about MagSafe for iPhone and Mac or want to offer feedback on this guide?

      "text": "Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Models\nContents\nOn September 9, Apple will introduce the iPhone 17 Pro and the iPhone 17 Pro Max, two new high-end flagship devices that will be sold alongside the iPhone 17 and the all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 \"Air\" that's replacing the iPhone 17 Plus.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will get a refreshed design for the rear casing and the camera area. Rumors suggest Apple could go with a part glass, part aluminum build, which would increase durability. The glass would allow wireless charging to continue to be available, but a partial aluminum frame would be less prone to breakage.\nWe're also expecting an update to the rear camera, with some rumors suggesting Apple is working on a horizontal camera bump that would be a major deviation from the current square-shaped camera arrangement. With this setup, there would be a centered, horizontal camera bump at the back of the iPhone, with the three lenses arranged in either a horizontal orientation or the standard triangle orientation, just with a larger bump.\n120Hz ProMotion refresh rates are rumored for all models, so better refresh rates may no longer be a Pro iPhone exclusive Apple is also rumored to be adding a more resilient anti-reflective display that's able to better hold up against drops and scratches.\nThere won't be size changes, because Apple increased the size of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max last year, and there are no rumors of an updated size. The iPhone 17 Pro will continue to measure in at 6.3 inches, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be 6.9 inches.\nApple is developing new A-series chips for the iPhone 17 Pro models, built on the latest 3-nanometer node. We could see some improvements to efficiency and performance, with Apple set to use A19 Pro chips for the higher-end 2025 iPhones.\nThis roundup focuses on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. For an overview of all iPhone 17 models, we have a separate iPhone 17 roundup, and we also have specifics on the super thin iPhone 17 Air in that roundup.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\nThere will be two models, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Apple increased the size of the Pro lineup last year, and we're expecting those same screen sizes with no further changes in 2025. The iPhone 17 Pro will measure in at 6.3 inches, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max will measure in at 6.9 inches. Overall size isn't going to change, but rumors suggest we could see some \"significant\" design updates, specifically to the rear of the device.\nApple could eliminate the titanium frame that it's used for the last several years, instead transitioning back to using aluminum. The iPhone 17 Pro models might have an aluminum frame and a back that's half glass and half aluminum instead of all glass. The half-and-half design would improve durability at the top where there's aluminum, while still allowing for wireless charging with the glass at the bottom.\nWhile some rumors have said the iPhone 17 Pro will have a two-tone design with a camera bump that's a different color than the rest of the device, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says that the camera area will be the same color as the rest of the iPhone, the same as the iPhone 16 models are now.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could be thicker in order to accommodate a larger battery, with the thickness coming in at 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm.\nRumors suggest that Apple might redesign the camera bump. Rather than a square bump, Apple could adopt a larger \"rectangular\" camera bump that's made from aluminum instead of glass and that spans across the back of the device. A horizontal camera bump would be a major design change, and suggests that the lenses of the camera would be arranged horizontally.\nThere is said to be a \"glass section\" around the logo that's integrated into an \"overall metal chassis,\" which has previously been described as a half aluminum, half glass build. The glass section of the iPhone will accommodate wireless charging, while the rest could be made from aluminum to improve durability.\niPhone 17 Pro dummy models and CAD Renders have an outlined area on the back that ranges from the camera module to the bottom of the chassis, mirroring the rumored half aluminum, half glass design that we've heard about.\nA leaked iPhone 17 Pro aluminum chassis features an area for the camera bump, confirming that the next-generation iPhone will a sturdier build that won't break as readily as glass.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro cases provide a look at just how large the rear camera bump might be. There is an oversized rectangular cutout that spans the entire back of the case.\nA test version of the iPhone 17 Pro may have been spotted in the wild, with the device confirming the updated rear camera design.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could have a new antenna design that wraps around the rear camera bump, possibly providing improved 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity compared to prior-generation models. There may also be fewer antenna lines.\nColors\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro components suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro models could be available in a copper-like orange color, along with black, gray, silver, and a dark blue shade. If the parts are accurate, these could be the colors that Apple will offer.\nOne leaker has suggested that one of the iPhone 17 Pro colors could somehow reflect the Liquid Glass design language in the iOS 26 update. Instant Digital said that there is a \"special\" color that is \"connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design.\nThe leaker believes that the color that prior leaks refer to as white actually looks different depending on the light, perhaps with more of an iridescent look.\nMagSafe\nApple may relocate the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models, possibly because of the redesigned camera module. Rumors suggest that Apple will move the logo lower on the device, and it could be located inside a break in the MagSafe ring.\nTo accommodate the relocated logo, Apple may also tweak the MagSafe magnet layout compared to existing iPhone models. Leaked images of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro magnet array feature a design with an open bottom for the Apple logo.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nDisplay\nAll iPhone 17 models could get 120Hz ProMotion technology in 2025, which would mean ProMotion would no longer be a Pro-only feature.\nWhile multiple rumors have suggested ProMotion display capabilities will expand to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, a Chinese leaker believes that's partially inaccurate. The leaker says that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will get 120Hz displays, but that the displays will not support adaptive refresh rates down to 1Hz.\nA 120Hz panel would allow for smoother scrolling, animations, and UI transitions, but it would not allow for always-on display functionality.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models were going to be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating, but it sounds like that might not happen this year after all. Apple ran into issues scaling up its display coating process, and it was too slow when taking into account millions of devices, so the coating plan was scrapped.\nThere have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island across the iPhone 17 lineup, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size.\nA-Series Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will adopt Apple's next-generation A19 Pro chip. The A19 Pro will be built on an upgraded N3P 3-nanometer process that should bring modest efficiency and speed improvements compared to the A18 Pro.\nRAM\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have 12GB RAM, up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nThermal Improvements\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could use a vapor chamber cooling technology for improved thermal performance. Vapor chamber technology disperses heat across a larger surface area to prevent thermal throttling and to keep performance stable, and it could be a benefit for Apple's high-powered A19 chip.\nA copper thermal plate said to be for the vapor cooling system surfaced in June.\nCamera\nAll four 2025 iPhone models are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nApple is expected to upgrade the Telephoto lens to 48 megapixels, a major improvement over the current 12-megapixel Telephoto lens. The iPhone 17 Pro models will be the first iPhones with three 48-megapixel lenses, as the Wide and Ultra Wide lenses have already been upgraded to 48 megapixels.\nOne leaker has suggested the new 48-megapixel Telephoto lens will offer 3.5x optical zoom (85mm equivalent) instead of the 5x zoom (120mm equivalent) that is currently available. 3.5x optical zoom could be better suited for portraits, and the higher resolution allows for more cropping in, allowing Apple to also simulate 5x optical zoom. Apple already uses this method for the Fusion camera in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, as the Wide lens enables a 2x digital crop that is the only \"telephoto\" option for Apple's more affordable iPhones.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could support shooting 8K video, up from the current 4K recording maximum.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models might offer dual video recording, a feature that would allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously. Some apps already support this functionality, which is useful for content creators, but the built-in camera does not.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro's Wide camera could have a mechanical aperture that lets users adjust the size of the aperture to tweak the amount of light that reaches the lens. Current iPhones have fixed apertures, but a variable aperture will allow for more control over the depth of field.\nOne tipster claims that the iPhone 17 Pro will feature a Telephoto lens that supports up to 8x optical zoom, up from 5x optical zoom on the 16 Pro models. There may also be a second Camera Control button for accessing camera settings.\nIt's possible that some feature of the Telephoto lens will be exclusive to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. The Telephoto lens is supposed to get upgraded to 48 megapixels, and there are rumors that the lens might be able to switch from 5x zoom to 8x zoom.\nThe 5x to 8x zoom could possibly be limited to the iPhone 17 Pro Max because a moving lens like that requires more internal space.\nBattery and Charging\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max could have Apple's biggest iPhone battery to date, with a battery capacity of 5,000mAh. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 4,676mAh battery, so the 17 Pro Max could last longer than the 33 hour maximum that the 16 Pro Max features. The A19 Pro and new Qualcomm Snapdragon X80 modem could also increase battery life.\nWith the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, Apple introduced a new battery adhesive that can be loosened with a low-voltage electrical current, making the batteries easier to remove and replace. That same technology could be used in the iPhone 17 Pro models this year.\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models might have a reverse wireless charging feature that allows them to wirelessly charge the AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple supposedly tested reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but it's not yet clear if it will be in the final version of the device.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nAn image of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro battery suggests it will have a metal cover and a slight L-shape. Apple could also use the removable adhesive that it used for the standard iPhone 16 models, which would make repair simpler.\nConnectivity\nWhile the iPhone 17 Air will have Apple's C1 5G modem, the iPhone 17 Pro models will continue to use 5G modems from Qualcomm. Qualcomm modems support both 6GHz and mmWave 5G, while the C1 is limited to 6GHz 5G.\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\niPhone 17 Ultra?\nOne rumor has suggested the largest of Apple's iPhones in 2025 will be called the \"iPhone 17 Ultra\" instead of \"iPhone 17 Pro Max,\" but this is a rumor that we've heard twice before during the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, so there is a good chance that this information is not accurate.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and camera design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro could be $50 more expensive than the prior-generation iPhone 16 Pro, but it might start with 256GB of storage rather than 128GB of storage, which would raise the price.\nLaunch Date\nApple is holding an \"Awe Dropping\" iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The iPhone 17 Pro models will debut at the event. Pre-orders are likely to follow on Friday, September 12, and a launch could happen on Friday, September 19.\nWhat's Next for the iPhone Lineup\nStarting in 2026, Apple will split its iPhone lineup between fall and spring launches. The iPhone 18 Air, iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and a foldable iPhone will launch in the second half of 2026, while the standard iPhone 18 and the iPhone 18e won't launch until spring 2027.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models that are coming in 2026 could have under-display Face ID, which would cut down on the size of the Dynamic Island. There might just be a single camera hole for the front-facing camera, with the camera cutout located in the top left corner. Later, in 2027, Apple could release an iPhone with an all-screen design, featuring an edge-to-edge display with no cutouts. Apple is essentially planning iPhone design updates every year through 2027.\nApple's first foldable iPhone is expected in fall 2026, and rumors suggest it will launch alongside the iPhone 18 Air and iPhone 18 Pro models. It is expected to have a \"nearly invisible\" crease when it's folded, thanks to a high-quality hinge.\nMore on the iPhone 18 lineup with Apple's first foldable iPhone can be found in our dedicated iPhone 18 roundup."

      "text": "In 2007, Apple launched the original iPhone, kickstarting the modern smartphone era which is now dominated by iPhone and Android devices. We've had 18 generations of iPhones so far, with the latest models, the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, introduced in September 2024, and the iPhone 16e released in February 2025. Apple follows an annual update cycle, introducing new flagship models while discounting prior-year models and selling them at more affordable price points.\niPhone vs Android\nOver the years, Android and iPhone smartphones have evolved to the point where feature-wise, they're similar in function and capability. Android smartphones are made by multiple manufacturers, but the core operating system is provided by Google, which leads to a wider variety of phones and price points to choose from, but weaker integration between software and hardware.\nApple's control of both the iPhone and the operating system (iOS) provides a more consistent experience along with ongoing support. With iOS 18, Apple supports all iPhones that were introduced in the last four years, so the majority of active iPhone owners can and do upgrade to the newest version of iOS that Apple rolls out each year.\nAndroid updates are often more inconsistent and often don't make it to all Android-based smartphones because each manufacturer has to implement support on an individual basis. So while Google also does yearly Android updates, the reality is that a lot of older Android smartphones don't get the new software.\nWith Apple's control and curation of the iPhone experience, the iPhone is largely considered to be the more secure platform, and Apple has made it a point to focus heavily on privacy. Apple's iOS is less customizable than Android, though, so for individuals who prefer flexibility and customization options, the Android operating system may be worth looking at.\nHow Do iPhone Updates Work?\nHere are the basics you should know about how Apple updates the iPhone and the iOS operating system.\nEach fall, typically in September, Apple releases a new series of flagship smartphones. These often come at high prices and feature the latest technologies, with Apple offering high-end models and still high-end but more affordable models. Prior-year iPhones often stick around with lower price points as cheaper alternatives to the latest and greatest technology, and occasionally, Apple launches a lower-cost iPhone outside of the normal fall timeline.\nAt the current time, Apple's iPhone lineup includes the iPhone 15 (2023), iPhone 15 Plus (2023), iPhone 16 (2024), iPhone 16 Plus (2024), iPhone 16 Pro (2024), iPhone 16 Pro Max (2024), and iPhone 16e (2025).\nApple also debuts an updated version of iOS at the same time that new iPhones launch, but new versions of iOS are pre-introduced every year at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference to give developers time to incorporate new features and technologies into their apps ahead of when the software becomes available to the public. The current iPhones run iOS 18.\nIn this guide, we go over all of the iPhones that are in the current Apple lineup, offer up some buying suggestions, and provide tips and resources for both new and existing iPhone owners.\niPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max ($999+)\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are Apple's current high-end flagship devices with all of the top-of-the-line features and the most bells and whistles. The Pro models are for those who want to get the most out of their iPhones with the latest feature set.\nPricing on the iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999, while pricing on the iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199. The two iPhones are nearly identical when it comes to feature set, and it's only display size and battery capacity that set the two devices apart.\nApple introduced larger screen sizes and slimmed down bezels for the Pro lineup in 2024, so the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a larger 6.9-inch display (up from 6.7 inches), and the iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3 inch display (up from 6.1 inches). Both models feature the same design with a glass front and back, a lightweight but durable titanium frame, and squircle edges. Colors this year include natural titanium, white titanium, black titanium, and desert titanium, which is a shade of gold.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max feature edge-to-edge OLED displays with the slimmest bezels we've seen in an iPhone to date. There's a second-generation \"Ceramic Shield\" that offers superior scratch resistance, and a pill-shaped Dynamic Island continues to house the front-facing camera and hardware used for Face ID authentication.\nThe customizable Action button is still available, and it now does more thanks to Control Center integration. This year, Apple also added a Camera Control button that can be used to activate the camera with a press. Camera Control makes it quicker to capture photos and videos, and it is also pressure and touch sensitive so you can change controls and adjust settings without touching the screen.\nThe Dynamic Island has been incorporated into the iPhone's interface and it is able to show various notifications and app information for phone calls, timers, Face ID, Bluetooth connections, and more.\nApple added a new A18 Pro chip to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, with a 6-core CPU, a 6-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is up to 20 percent faster than the A17 Pro from the iPhone 15 Pro models, and it is the fastest iPhone for Apple Intelligence.\nThere continues to be a three-lens camera setup with a 48-megapixel Main camera that offers improved low-light performance, a 12-megapixel 5x Telephoto lens, and a new 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera. The 5x Telephoto is available for both Pro models, which is new this year, and the 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera takes improved wide-angle and macro shots when lighting is poor.\nCrash Detection is able to determine if you've been in a serious car accident, alerting emergency services, and there's also an Emergency SOS via satellite feature for getting help if you're out of range of Wi-Fi and cellular. With iOS 18, the satellite connectivity can be used to send messages too.\nBoth iPhone 16 Pro models offer improvements to battery life, and they have a USB-C port and support for up to 25W MagSafe charging.\nOther features include IP68 water resistance, 8GB RAM, ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate for the display, faster 5G, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, faster USB-C charging, and Wi-Fi 7.\nKey Features:\n- Highest end, highest price\n- Triple-lens camera: Main (Wide), Ultra Wide, and Telephoto (5x for the Max)\n- 48-megapixel Main lens with ProRAW support\n- 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens with macro capability\n- Camera Control button\n- A18 Pro chip\n- Action button\n- Always-On Display\n- Titanium frame\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are the iPhones to choose if you want the absolute best camera capabilities that you can get in an iPhone, with the Pro Max being the top-of-the-line model due to its increased display size, and longer battery life. In terms of performance, there isn't much of a difference between the iPhone 16 Pro models and the standard iPhone 16 models, with screen size, display quality, and chassis material differentiating the two iPhone lines.\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus ($799+)\nSold alongside the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are Apple's more affordable flagship devices. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus feature many of the same capabilities as the Pro models, but they are missing some of the higher-end features to keep the price lower. The 6.1-inch iPhone 16 is priced starting at $799, while the 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus is priced starting at $899.\nDespite the difference in screen size, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are essentially identical, featuring a flat-edged design with a glass body and an aluminum frame. They do not offer ProMotion display technology and thus do not support an always-on display, but they do have the same Dynamic Island, front-facing camera, and Face ID authentication functionality.\nApple brought the Action button to the iPhone 16 lineup this year, so that is no longer a Pro-only feature. The Action button replaces the Ring/Silent switch, and it is customizable, so you can set it to bring up whatever is most convenient for you. It can mute/unmute your iPhone, activate the flashlight, open a favorite app, activate a Control Center control, turn on a Focus mode, and more.\nLike the iPhone 16 Pro models, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus have a new Camera Control button below the power button. Pressing the button activates the camera, and a double press snaps a photo, so it makes it much quicker to get the shot that you want. The button is capacitive and pressure sensitive, so it can be used for changing various camera settings and swapping between tools. It works much like a DSLR shutter for autofocus with a half press, and you can adjust exposure, style, zoom, aperture, and more without ever touching the iPhone's display.\nWhile the iPhone 16 Pro models have an A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 models have an almost-as-capable A18 chip that also works with Apple Intelligence. The A18 has the same 6-core CPU and 16-core Neural Engine, but it has a 5-core GPU instead of a 6-core GPU. The chip is built using the same 3-nanometer technology, and it enables support for ray tracing and console-quality games, a feature that was previously limited to the Pro models. Battery life has improved compared to the prior iPhone 15 models thanks to the new chip technology.\nThere is a dual camera system that features 12-megapixel Ultra Wide and 48-megapixel Fusion (Wide) lenses with no Telephoto lens. The primary camera can be cropped in to a 2x zoom, so 0.5, 1x, and 2x options are supported. Some of the same photography and videography capabilities that are in the Pro models are also in the standard iPhone 16 models, including the new Photographic Styles for customizing your images and Audio Mix for adjusting the sound in your videos, plus support for shooting spatial videos and images.\nCapturing video in 4K at 120 frames per second is a Pro-only feature, as is support for shooting in ProRAW and ProRes, so if those are capabilities you need, you'll want to look at the Pro models.\nThe iPhone 16 models have support for mmWave (U.S. only) and Sub-6GHz 5G, and they also have a USB-C port and offer MagSafe charging at up to 25W, a new, faster speed this year. Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via satellite, and Messages via satellite are available as well. Compared to the Pro models, the standard models lack the titanium chassis, the Telephoto camera lens, and the A18 Pro chip.\nKey Features:\n- Dual-lens camera: Fusion (Wide), Ultra Wide\n- Crash Detection\n- USB-C port\n- Action button\n- Camera Control\n- A18 chip\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus offer many of the same features as the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max at a more affordable price, and these are the iPhones that we recommend for most people. The differences are limited primarily to the camera and the display, and may not be of interest for those who are not heavily invested in iPhone photography, making the $200+ savings worth it for most. Older iPhones are another option to save money, but be aware that only the four iPhone 16 models and the prior-generation iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max support Apple Intelligence.\niPhone 16e ($599+)\nPriced starting at $599, the iPhone 16e is similar in design to the iPhone 16, but it is actually modeled after the iPhone 14. It has an all-display design with Face ID, but it has an older-style notch rather than a Dynamic Island.\nThe iPhone 16e has a 6.1-inch OLED display like the iPhone 16, and it has the same 8GB RAM and A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence, though there is one less GPU core. It is the first iPhone with Apple's new C1 modem, which is more efficient than Qualcomm's comparable X71 modem in the iPhone 16. While there is no mmWave 5G support, there seems to be no compromise to the more widespread sub-6GHz Wi-Fi speeds.\nThere is a single-lens rear camera in the iPhone 16e, and it is the same as the 48-megapixel Wide camera in the iPhone 16. It can take 1x and 2x photos, but there is no 0.5x option and no 5x zoom as there is in the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nThe iPhone 16e has the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone, and the battery lasts for up to 26 hours when watching video. It charges via USB-C, but it does not support MagSafe and wireless charging is limited to 7.5W. Not being able to use MagSafe is one of the main downsides to the iPhone 16e.\nIt is also worth noting that there is no Ultra Wideband chip for Precision Finding in the Find My app, and it is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so it will not connect to the 6GHz networks available with Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers.\nOther features include Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via Satellite, and Messages via Satellite, but these are also features available with other iPhone 16 models.\nKey Features:\n- Face ID\n- A18 chip\n- Lower price\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16e is now Apple's lowest-price iPhone, and it is worthwhile if you can live without a dual-lens camera system, faster Wi-Fi connectivity, and MagSafe. It has many of the same features as the iPhone 16 at a $200 lower price point.\niPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus ($699+)\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are Apple's prior-generation flagship devices that are now being sold at a discount. They have older technology and are lacking some of the new features that Apple introduced with the iPhone 16 models, including the Camera Control button, the faster A-series chip, the Action button, and, most importantly, support for Apple Intelligence. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus cannot run the new Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18, so only consider Apple's prior-generation iPhones if that is not important to you.\nThe iPhone 15 models don't look notably different from the iPhone 16 models, except for the color options. Apple did not make major design changes, but the iPhone 15 models do not have a Camera Control button and they have a Ring/Silent switch instead of an Action button. There's also a diagonal rear camera setup that does not offer some of the newer camera capabilities like Photographic Styles for customizing the look of your images or Audio Mix for tweaking the sound in your videos.\nWhile the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus don't support some of the newer software-based camera features, the hardware is largely the same. There's a Main (Wide) lens that supports 1x and 2x zoom, and an Ultra Wide lens. There is no dedicated Telephoto lens.\nThe iPhone 15 measures in at 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 15 Plus is 6.7 inches. The two devices are essentially identical, with a Dynamic Island for Face ID, aluminum frames, and OLED screen technology. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have an older A16 chip that is two generations behind the newer chips in the current flagship models.\nThe iPhone 15 models have support for mmWave (U.S. only) and Sub-6GHz 5G and use the X70 Qualcomm chip, one generation behind the Qualcomm chip in the new iPhones. Battery life is a little shorter, but the iPhone 15 models do support MagSafe and USB-C. There is no support for the faster 25W MagSafe charging, though, with the iPhone 15 models limited to 15W MagSafe charging.\nBetween the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, the features are identical with the exception of screen size and battery, as the iPhone 15 Plus can accommodate a larger battery size.\nKey Features:\n- Diagonal dual-lens camera: Main (Wide), Ultra Wide\n- Crash Detection\n- USB-C port\n- Dynamic Island\n- 5G support\n- A16 chip\nBottom Line: The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are solid devices that will perform well at an affordable price, but keep in mind that the iPhone 16 is such a notable upgrade that it may be worth paying $100 more for the iPhone 16 this year. The iPhone 15 models do not have an Action button or a Camera Control button, and they cannot run the Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18, so you'd be missing out on the more capable Siri, customizable emoji, Writing Tools, and other Apple Intelligence functions. A prior-generation iPhone is usually a good way to save money, but this year, we don't recommend it.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThere's no one single iPhone that's best for everyone, and picking the right smartphone needs to take into account factors like budget, desired battery life, preferred feature set, and more.\nIf you want the absolute best photographic capabilities for example, you're going to want the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max, and if you want something that has a solid feature set at a great price, the iPhone 16e is what you'll want to look at.\nBelow, we've outlined some of the best iPhone choices based on different scenarios or features that you might be looking for.\nWhich iPhone Has the Best Battery Life?\nWith the efficient A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has the longest battery life for any iPhone to date at up to 33 hours when watching videos. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Plus are second and will last up to 27 hours when watching videos. The iPhone 16e lasts for up to 26 hours when watching videos, and it is the smallest of the bunch at 6.1 inches.\nWhich iPhone Has the Best Camera?\nWith their updated triple-lens camera systems, 48-megapixel Fusion lens, 5x Telephoto lens, 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and LiDAR Scanners, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max have the best iPhone cameras that you can get. Both of the new iPhones include a three-lens camera system with the same feature set. This year, the Ultra Wide lens has been upgraded to 48 megapixels, allowing for more detailed wide-angle and macro shots.\nThe Fusion lens supports 24-megapixel and 48-megapixel high-resolution photos through the Photonic Engine, and the Ultra Wide lens supports 12-megapixel images that have the detail from the combined pixels of the 48-megapixel resolution. Using computational photography, the Fusion camera can be set to 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths to better mirror what's possible with DSLRs.\nAll four iPhone 16 models have a new Camera Control button that makes it easier to capture a photo or a video with just a couple of button presses, and the Camera Control button is also capacitive and pressure sensitive so it can be used for changing photography modes and adjusting settings, which makes your iPhone feel more like a camera.\nWhich iPhone Has Touch ID?\nUnfortunately, none of Apple's iPhones have Touch ID. It has been phased out, and Face ID is the only option.\nWhich iPhone is Best For One-Handed Use?\nThe iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16e both measure in at 6.1 inches, and they are the smallest iPhones that Apple makes. They won't work for one-handed use for everyone, but they are a better option than the 16 Plus and 16 Pro Max.\nWhich iPhone is the Best Value?\nWith Apple Intelligence support, a 48-megapixel camera, OLED display, and 5G connectivity for $599, the iPhone 16e is the best deal that Apple offers. If you need faster mmWave 5G speeds, Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, MagSafe, and an Ultra Wide camera, the $799 iPhone 16 is the upgrade option.\nIf you don't need the latest bells and whistles like Apple Intelligence and don't mind losing out on a bit of performance and battery life, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, which are $100 cheaper than than their iPhone 16 counterparts, could be worth considering.\nFor many people, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16e are the iPhones to get this year with their lower price point and modern feature set.\nWhich iPhone Has the Most Features?\nIf you want the iPhone with the most bells and whistles, that's the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. These iPhones offer OLED displays, triple-lens cameras, glass bodies with titanium steel frames, larger maximum storage capacities, and longer battery life.\nCompared to the iPhone 16 models, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have better camera capabilities. The absolute best would be the iPhone 16 Pro Max because of its larger display and bigger battery.\nIn More Detail\nStill not sure?

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Air that's coming in just under two weeks will feature the biggest design update we've seen to the iPhone since the iPhone X back in 2017. It's the most exciting iPhone release in years, and it'll be the highlight of Apple's \"Awe Dropping\" event.\nHere's everything we know about the iPhone 17 Air.\nSize and Design\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, with a thicker pill-shaped horizontal bump for the camera. It will be the thinnest iPhone to date, and over 2mm thinner than the 7.80mm iPhone 16.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will measure in at 6.6 inches, so it'll have a slightly smaller display than the iPhone 16 Plus that it is replacing. Since it's so thin, the iPhone 17 Air will also be much lighter to hold than standard iPhones.\nApple is supposedly using a hybrid titanium-aluminum frame, and the weight could come in at around 145 grams. At 145 grams, the iPhone 17 Air would be just a little heavier than the iPhone 13 mini.\nLike the iPhone 17 Pro models, the iPhone 17 Air will supposedly have a frame that uses less glass than current models, so it could be able to better withstand damage from drops.\nThere are a few design compromises that Apple made for such a thin iPhone. The USB-C port isn't centered front to back at the bottom, and the speaker grilles have been simplified with fewer cutouts.\nAs for colors, the iPhone 17 Air will be available in black, white, light gold, and a light blue shade that's similar to the blue that Apple used for the MacBook Air.\nDisplay\nThe 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air display will use the same Samsung LTPO OLED panels as the iPhone 16 Pro models, offering 30 percent better brightness compared to the iPhone 16 display.\nThe updated panel supports 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, so that could be a feature coming to the iPhone 17 Air models. ProMotion refresh rates have always been a Pro iPhone feature in the past, but rumors suggest the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature the technology. LTPO also enables always-on display because it supports refresh rates as low as 1Hz in the iPhone 16 Pro models, but it's not yet clear if the iPhone 17 Air will offer an always-on display.\nOne rumor says that the LTPO displays for the iPhone 17 Air will support 120Hz, but not 1Hz, which would not allow for an always-on display.\nThere have been some mixed rumors about a slimmer Dynamic Island, so it's not known if there will be changes there.\nA-Series Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Air will feature either an A19 chip or an A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core than the A19 Pro chip used in the iPhone 17 Pro. Apple is planning to use vapor chamber heatsinks for the iPhone 17 lineup to improve thermal performance by spreading heat more evenly across a large area.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have 12GB RAM like the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nBattery\nSince the iPhone 17 Air is only expected to be 5.5mm thick, it's going to have less room for a battery. Apple is optimizing battery life with the C1 modem, processor improvements, and high-density battery technology, but the iPhone 17 Air could have notably worse battery life than the other iPhone 17 models.\nRumors suggest it will feature a 2,800mAh battery, which would be around the same size as the battery that Apple used in the iPhone 12. A leaked battery suggests that it's half as thick as the battery in the iPhone 17 Pro.\nWireless Charging\nThe iPhone 17 Air will support the Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, so it will be able to charge at up to 25W with compatible Qi 2.2 chargers. 25W matches MagSafe charging speeds.\nCamera\nThere is limited internal space in the iPhone 17 Air, so it will have a single-lens rear camera like the iPhone 16e. Apple plans to use the 48-megapixel Wide camera, and with just a single camera, the iPhone 17 Air may not support spatial videos or spatial photos.\nAll of the iPhone 17 models will have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera with better image quality than the 12-megapixel camera in the current iPhone 16 models.\nConnectivity\nThe iPhone 17 Air will use the same C1 modem chip that Apple debuted in the iPhone 16e, which means it won't support faster mmWave 5G speeds. All iPhone 17 models will use a new Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support, and Apple's own hardware could bring efficiency and connectivity improvements.\nOther iPhone 17 Air Features\n- Camera Control\n- MagSafe Charging\n- Action Button\n- No SIM tray in more countries\n- Launches with iOS 26\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be priced at $899, which is the same price as the current iPhone 16 Plus. There have been rumors of tariff-related price hikes, so it is possible that the price will be higher.\nRead More\nWe have additional information on the iPhone 17 Air in our dedicated iPhone 17 Air roundup."

      "text": "The 2025 iPhone 17\nContents\n2025 may bring one of the biggest updates to the iPhone's design that we've seen since the 2017 iPhone X, with Apple rumored to be planning for an all-new iPhone 17 \"Air\" that has a thinner design, a new display size, a different look for the camera, and more.\nWe are expecting four total models in 2025: the iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro, the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and the new iPhone 17 \"Air.\" There will be no iPhone 17 Plus, with Apple doing away with the \"Plus\" lineup because it has not proven popular with customers. The slimmed down iPhone 17 Air won't be a direct replacement for the iPhone 17 Plus, instead making a debut as a new device option in the lineup. Rumors suggest that the upcoming iPhone 17 Air will have a display that's around 6.6 inches, and a chassis that's 6mm thick or less.\nIf we compare the iPhone lineup to the Mac and iPad lineups, the iPhone 17 Air will be comparable to the MacBook Air or the iPad Air, while the iPhone 17 Pro is the equivalent of the MacBook Pro or the iPad Pro.\nBecause the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will have 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch display sizes like the current 16 Pro models, the iPhone 17 Air will be right in the middle of those two devices in terms of size. Apple is also expected to increase the overall size of the standard iPhone 17 to 6.3 inches to match the size of the iPhone 17 Pro.\nSome early rumors suggested the slimmer iPhone 17 Air could be a high-end device that's more expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but it's actually going to be a mid-tier device that's less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, but more expensive than the iPhone 17. In that way, it will replace the \"Plus\" iPhone in the lineup as a middle ground in price between the 17 and the 17 Pro.\nAll four iPhones released in 2025 are expected to get ProMotion display technology with a 120Hz maximum refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video playback, which means that ProMotion will no longer be a feature limited to the Pro iPhone models. The change will be enabled by LTPO OLED displays that Apple is rumored to be using for all of the iPhone 17 models. Always-on display technology is also enabled by LTPO display technology, but it's not yet clear if always-on will come to all models or remain exclusive to the Pro iPhone models.\nFor the Pro models, Apple could swap out titanium for aluminum, and part of the glass frame could transition to aluminum for better durability. We've heard rumors indicating that the iPhone 17 Pro models will have a half-glass half-aluminum exterior, with the glass portion still allowing for MagSafe charging. This update could come alongside a camera design change, with Apple perhaps opting for a horizontal pill-shaped camera bump rather than the traditional square camera bump. We've also heard that the iPhone 17 Air could have a horizontal camera bump, so this is likely to be a design change that we'll see for multiple iPhones in the lineup.\nAs for camera updates, Apple is said to be working on an updated 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max could include an upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto camera, which would be an improvement over the current 12-megapixel sensor. The iPhone 17 is expected to have the same Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, while the iPhone 17 Air is expected to get a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera.\nAt least one iPhone 17 model next year will get an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip rather than a chip manufactured by Broadcom, and it's likely to be the iPhone 17 Air. Apple is also expected to use its own modem chip in the device, testing it instead of a Qualcomm chip. The standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro models are likely to continue to use Qualcomm chips.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nDesign\niPhone 17\nThis year, Apple is planning for an iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Air, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max, but there will be no iPhone 17 Plus in the lineup. Apple is nixing the \"Plus\" iPhone due to subpar sales and limited customer interest in the device.\nThe standard iPhone 17 will look a lot like the current iPhone 16, with most rumors focusing on the iPhone 17 Air and the iPhone 17 Pro models. So far, we haven't heard a lot that's specific to the iPhone 17, and it will be the iPhone that gets the fewest new features in terms of design.\nWe are expecting a larger display size. Rumors suggest the iPhone 17 display will be 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches. At 6.3 inches, it'll be the same size as the iPhone 16 Pro, which is also the size that Apple plans to use for the iPhone 17 Pro. Apple is eliminating the Plus model entirely, so there's just going to be the one lower-priced standard iPhone 17. Display sizes across the lineup will be 6.3 inches for the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro, 6.6 inches for the iPhone 17 Air, and 6.9 inches for the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\nThe iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to have a new rectangular camera bar with rounded corners, with the bar spanning the back of the iPhone. The standard iPhone 17 model is not expected to feature the same design change, and it will continue to look like the iPhone 16 with two vertical rear cameras positioned in a pill-shaped camera bump.\nApple is said to be testing new green and purple shades for the upcoming iPhone 17 models. The iPhone 17 models could come in black, white, steel gray, light blue, green, and purple.\nBased on CAD renders, mockups, and dummy models, there is no change to the design of the iPhone 17 camera, while the iPhone 17 Air has a single lens rear camera with an elongated bump. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max feature a wide bump that houses three lenses in the same arrangement as the current design, but with a horizontal bump that adds more space between the lenses and the LiDAR and flash.\nAll of the iPhone 17 models coming in 2025 could feature slimmed down bezels, with the smaller bezels of the 16 Pro and Pro Max expanding to the iPhone 17.\nThere have been mixed rumors about the size of the Dynamic Island for the iPhone 17 models. Analyst Jeff Pu claims that Apple is using metalens technology for Face ID that will allow for a narrower Dynamic Island on all four models, but Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect notable changes to the Dynamic Island and he believes it will be the same size as the iPhone 16 Dynamic Island.\niPhone 17 'Air'\nMultiple rumors have suggested that Apple is working on an all-new version of the iPhone for 2025, with the device expected to have a \"significantly thinner\" design than current iPhone models. It won't be a direct replacement for the \"Plus\" iPhone that Apple has released for the last several years, but we aren't getting an iPhone 17 Plus this year in order to make room for the new iPhone 17 Air.\nWe've heard Apple's new super thin iPhone referred to as the \"iPhone 17 Slim\" or the \"iPhone 17 Air,\" but we don't know what Apple will actually call the new iPhone when it launches in 2025. iPhone 17 Air seems to make the most sense given that Apple already has a MacBook Air and an iPad Air and uses the name to distinguish those devices from higher-end Pro models.\nThe placeholder names reference the sleeker, thinner design of the device. Rumors have not exactly agreed on size, and we've heard everything from 5mm thick to a bit over 6mm thick. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes the iPhone 17 Air will be about two millimeters thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick, so an iPhone 17 that is 2mm thinner would come in at around 6.25mm. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, and his wording suggests that it would have a thicker rear camera bump area that exceeds the size of the 5.5mm chassis.\nAnalyst Jeff Pu has also suggested that the upcoming iPhone will be around 6mm thick, but The Information has said it will be between 5mm and 6mm thick. Dummy models are 5.5mm thick, so the iPhone 17 Air will be Apple's thinnest iPhone to date. The iPhone 6, which measured in at 6.9mm, is the thinnest iPhone Apple has released so far. iPhones actually got thicker with the iPhone X and beyond, as Apple needed more space for the battery, camera lenses, Face ID hardware, and more.\nAs for overall display size, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to fall somewhere between the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max in size. Separate rumors have targeted 6.55 inches, 6.6 inches, and 6.65 inches as the diagonal display size that Apple has settled on, which would make it smaller than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but larger than the 17 Pro.\nRumors suggest that the iPhone 17 Air will weigh in at 145 grams. That would make it similar in weight to the iPhone SE 2 or the iPhone 13 mini, which are 148 grams and 141 grams, respectively.\nThe Information claims the rear camera of the device will be relocated from the upper left side of the iPhone to the center of the device. The camera setup was described as a \"large, centered camera bump\" on the back of the device. Such a design has been seen in an alleged component leak and in dummy models, plus we've heard similar rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have some subtle design changes so that all of the internal components can fit despite the thinness of the chassis. Dummy models suggest that the USB-C port on the bottom edge won't be centered front to back, and will instead be shifted closer to the rear of the device. Colors could include black, silver, gold, and a very light blue.\nThe speaker grilles have also been simplified, with just two holes on either side of the port rather than the typical five. The device will include MagSafe charging, a Camera Control button, and an Action Button.\nA closer look at the thin design of the iPhone 17 Air can be seen in a video that shows off an iPhone 17 Air dummy model. Dummy models are often an accurate representation of what we can expect, as they are created for case makers based on leaked information from Apple's suppliers.\nFor more information on the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, we have a dedicated iPhone 17 Air roundup.\niPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are going to have some significant design changes. Apple is allegedly planning to eliminate the titanium frame, instead going back to aluminum. Apple has not used aluminum for a higher-end iPhone since the stainless steel iPhone X was introduced in 2017.\nAlong with an aluminum frame, the iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to include a half-aluminum half-glass backing rather than an all-glass back. The top half of the back could be made from aluminum, while the bottom half will continue to be made from glass to support wireless charging functionality. A partial aluminum back would potentially make the iPhone 17 Pro models more durable to drops.\nApple is planning for a larger \"rectangular\" horizontal camera bump that is made from aluminum rather than glass. Current camera bumps are square, so a rectangular camera bump would be a notable design change. Though the rear camera design is changing, the lenses themselves are expected to still be arranged in a triangle shape.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro cases provide a look at just how large the rear camera bump might be. There is an oversized rectangular cutout that spans the entire back of the case.\nApple may relocate the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models, possibly because of the redesigned camera module. Rumors suggest that Apple will move the logo lower on the device, and it could be located inside a break in the MagSafe ring.\nTo accommodate the relocated logo, Apple may also tweak the MagSafe magnet layout compared to existing iPhone models. Leaked images of the alleged iPhone 17 Pro magnet array feature a design with an open bottom for the Apple logo.\nLeaked iPhone 17 Pro components suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro models could be available in a copper-like orange color, along with black, gray, silver, and dark blue. If the parts are accurate, these could be the colors that Apple will offer.\nAdditional rumors about the iPhone 17 Pro can be found in the iPhone 17 Pro roundup.\nOne leaker has suggested that one of the iPhone 17 Pro colors could somehow reflect the Liquid Glass design language in the iOS 26 update. Instant Digital said that there is a \"special\" color that is \"connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design.\nThe leaker believes that the color that prior leaks refer to as white actually looks different depending on the light, perhaps with more of an iridescent look.\niPhone 17 Cases\nApple is rumored to be designing new \"TechWoven\" fabric-style cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. The cases are said to offer enhanced durability compared to the prior FineWoven cases that Apple used to sell.\nThe iPhone cases appear to have small holes at the bottom corners that would accommodate a lanyard or a crossbody strap. They are said to have metallic buttons with \"improved tactile feedback,\" a Camera Control button, and MagSafe compatibility.\nThe cases could come in colors that include black, green, blue, purple, and orange.\nApple is also supposedly going to offer a crossbody strap that features a unique magnetic attachment system.\nThermal Upgrades\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly use vapor chamber cooling technology for improved thermal performance. Vapor chamber technology disperses heat across a larger surface area to prevent thermal throttling and to keep performance stable, and it could be a benefit for Apple's high-powered A19 chip.\nWhile this could be a feature limited to the iPhone 17 Pro, there has been a rumor suggesting that Apple will use a vapor chamber heatsink to improve thermal performance across all iPhone 17 models.\nDisplay\nThere are a few enhancements coming to the iPhone 17's display, with Apple adding a new coating and planning to bring Pro features to standard models.\nThe iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air are expected to use the same OLED panel as the current iPhone 16 Pro models, which is sourced from Samsung. The panel has a 30 percent increase in brightness and improved longevity compared to the prior-generation iPhone 16 display.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models may be updated with a scratch resistant anti-reflective display coating that will cut down on glare while also preventing minor scratches and other screen damage. It is said to be more durable than the current Ceramic Shield coating.\nProMotion and Always-On\nThe 120Hz \"ProMotion\" refresh rate has been limited to the Pro versions of the iPhone for several years, but in 2025, it is expected to expand to the entire iPhone lineup. Multiple rumors suggest that the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air models will include ProMotion support in addition to the iPhone 17 Pro models. ProMotion refresh rates would potentially allow for always-on display functionality, but it is not clear if Apple plans to expand always-on to the entire lineup.\nApple will use low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels for all iPhone 17 models, which is what enables ProMotion thanks to better power efficiency. ProMotion enables refresh rates ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz, and at the high end, the 120Hz refresh rate provides smoother scrolling and video content.\nWith all four iPhones slated to get ProMotion displays in 2025, ProMotion refresh rates will no longer be a feature that sets the Pro iPhone models apart.\nA-Series Chip\nThe iPhone 17 series won't get TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer chips, but we are expecting A19 chip technology that's likely built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. Apple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip, while the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air could have the standard A19 chip. There's also a chance that the iPhone 17 Air will have an A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core than the A19 Pro used for the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nThe A19 chips will be built on TSMC's 3NP process. Compared to earlier versions of 3nm chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.\nRAM\nThe iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Air are expected to include 12GB RAM, an improvement over the 8GB RAM in the current high-end iPhone 16 models. Rumors suggest the standard iPhone 17 will only have 8GB RAM.\nApple-Designed 5G Modem Chip\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to be one of the first iPhones to get an Apple-designed 5G modem, with Apple continuing to use Qualcomm modems for the other iPhone 17 models.\nApple's modem chip will be capable of theoretical 5G download speeds of up to 4Gb/s, which is slower than Qualcomm's modems in current phones. The chip will not support the fastest mmWave 5G, and will instead be limited to sub-6GHz 5G.\nSIM Tray\nApple will remove the physical SIM slot on iPhones in more countries next year, though it is not yet clear which countries. Apple did away with the SIM card tray in the United States with the iPhone 14 models, but a physical SIM has so far been present on iPhones sold outside of the United States.\nThe iPhone 17 Air is expected to lack a SIM tray entirely because of how thin it is.\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi Chip\nAll four iPhone 17 models that are coming in 2025 will have Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Wi-Fi 7 is already used in the iPhone 16 models, but Apple's chip design could bring additional efficiency and connectivity improvements, and it paves the way for a future all-in-one SoC.\nApple is aiming to create a wireless setup where the components are tightly integrated and more energy efficient, which will let the company cut down on the battery use of cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies.\nWi-Fi 7 supports data transmission over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz band simultaneously for faster speeds and lower latency with a supported router. Wi-Fi 7 supports peak speeds of more than 40Gb/s. Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected.\nBattery and Charging\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have batteries that are easier to remove, adopting the same technology Apple introduced in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus use a type of adhesive that can be loosened with a low-voltage electrical current, but the 16 Pro and Pro Max have standard adhesive.\nNext year, all iPhone 17 models might have the new, easier to remove adhesive, which makes battery replacements simpler.\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support 25W wireless charging with third-party wireless chargers that support the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard. Right now, iPhones are limited to 15W wireless charging with third-party chargers, but the new Qi standard supports up to 25W charging.\nThe upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models might have a reverse wireless charging feature that allows them to wirelessly charge the AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple supposedly tested reverse wireless charging for the iPhone 17 Pro models, but it's not yet clear if it will be in the final version of the device.\nCamera Updates\nAll iPhone models coming in 2025 are rumored to have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which is an improvement over the 12-megapixel front-facing camera in the iPhone 16 models. The camera will notably improve image quality, and allow for more cropping in without a loss of quality.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to feature a 48-megapixel Wide camera, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and a 48-megapixel Tetraprism Telephoto camera, which will make it the first iPhone to feature three 48-megapixel cameras, and it is also expected to support 8K video recording for the first time.\nThe iPhone 17 Air will have a single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera, while the standard iPhone 17 will have a dual-lens camera system with a Wide camera and an Ultra Wide camera.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models could feature a mechanical aperture that will let users adjust the size of the camera aperture, changing the amount of light reaching the lens. Current iPhone models have fixed apertures, but a variable aperture will let images be captured with shallow depth-of-field.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro models might also support dual video recording, a feature that would allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously. Some apps already support this functionality, which is useful for content creators, but the built-in camera does not.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will continue to include a 5x Telephoto optical zoom lens, and it will still be a Pro-exclusive feature. The standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air will not have the 5x zoom option and will have no Telephoto lenses.\nPricing\nThe iPhone 17 Air could be priced at $899, which is the current price for the iPhone 16 Plus. At $899, the iPhone 17 Air would be more expensive than the iPhone 17, but less expensive than the iPhone 17 Pro.\nThe iPhone 17 models may see a price hike, as Apple's component costs are increasing due to tariffs. Apple will pair the potential price increase with new features and design changes to justify the price to consumers, rather than blaming tariffs.\nThe iPhone 17 models could see a $50 price increase compared to the iPhone 16 models, according to Jeffries analyst Edison Lee. The price increase would mean the base iPhone 17 would start at $850.\niPhone 17 Launch Date\nApple is holding an \"Awe Dropping\" iPhone-centric event on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The iPhone 17 models will debut at the event. Pre-orders are likely to follow on Friday, September 12, and a launch could happen on Friday, September 19.\nAfter the iPhone 17\nStarting in 2026, Apple will split its iPhone lineup between fall and spring launches. The iPhone 18 Air, iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and a foldable iPhone will launch in the second half of 2026, while the standard iPhone 18 and the iPhone 18e won't launch until spring 2027.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models that are coming in 2026 could have under-display Face ID, which would cut down on the size of the Dynamic Island. There might just be a single camera hole for the front-facing camera, with the camera cutout located in the top left corner. Later, in 2027, Apple could release an iPhone with an all-screen design, featuring an edge-to-edge display with no cutouts.\nApple's first foldable iPhone is expected in fall 2026, and it will launch alongside the iPhone 18 Air and iPhone 18 Pro models. It is expected to have a \"nearly invisible\" crease when it's folded, thanks to a high-quality hinge.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro expected in 2026 could have a main rear camera with a variable aperture. A variable aperture lens would allow the iPhone to perform more like a DSLR camera, providing users with more manual control over the amount of light entering the lens.\nA variable aperture lens would be able to better adjust to different lighting conditions, and it would also allow for more control over depth of field for sharper focus on subjects and smoother background blur.\nThe iPhone 18 Pro models may include the C2 chip, an upgraded version of Apple's C1 modem. The C2 is expected to feature improved power consumption and transmission speed, and it will include mmWave 5G support.\nApple's iPhone 18 models will use Apple's A20 chip, which could be manufactured on the next-generation 2-nanometer process. The 2nm process will ensure that the A19 has notable speed and performance improvements over the 3nm A19 chip that's coming in the iPhone 17 lineup.\nA future version of the iPhone could have a 200-megapixel camera, which would match technology that Samsung has made available in its Galaxy line. The 200-megapixel camera would likely be for the rear Main lens, and a higher megapixel option would allow the iPhone to shoot photos with more detail. Images would be higher resolution, and would able to be cropped in further without loss of image quality."

The iPhone 16 Pro models have a more extensive feature set not available in the standard iPhone 16 devices, including more advanced camera technology, a better display, a faster A18 Pro chip, and more.\nFor the first time in several years, Apple updated the size of the iPhone 16 Pro models. The iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch display, up from 6.1 inches, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch display, up from 6.7 inches. Due to the new display sizes, the iPhone 16 models are slightly taller, heavier, and wider than the iPhone 15 Pro models, but some of the change was implemented through a major reduction in bezels.\nAs with the iPhone 15 Pro models, the iPhone 16 Pro models have a titanium alloy frame with better scratch and drop resistance than stainless steel. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max come in black titanium, natural titanium, white titanium, and desert titanium, which is a gold color.\nAside from the larger screen sizes, there are no design changes to the iPhone 16 Pro models. The devices have the same contoured edges, and the front of the display is protected by second-generation Ceramic Shield material that Apple says is 50 percent tougher than the prior Ceramic Shield.\nApple is using the same Super Retina XDR Display from last year with Always-On display technology and a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate, but there's now support for 1 nit minimum brightness. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a resolution of 2868x1320, while the iPhone 16 Pro has a resolution of 2622x1206. Aside from the slimmed down bezels, and minimum brightness change, there are no display changes, and it also features the same Dynamic Island at the top.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models each have a USB-C port that offers the same USB 3 transfer speeds up to 10Gb/s as in the iPhone 15 Pro models. With the USB-C port, an iPhone can be used to charge AirPods or an Apple Watch directly. Upgraded 25W MagSafe charging has been added with a new MagSafe Charger. 15W Qi2 charging is also supported.\nThe customizable Action button introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro is also available on the 16 Pro models, and it can be set to one of multiple functions, such as launching the camera, turning on Flashlight, recording a Voice Memo, or activating a Shortcut. The Action button ties in with the Dynamic Island for visual feedback that accompanies haptic feedback.\nApple added an all-new Camera Control button that's like an Action button for the Camera. It is touch and pressure sensitive and can be used to launch the camera and take a photo, capture a video, and adjust all kinds of camera settings. Apple modeled it after the shutter button of a DSLR camera, and it works in much the same way. Third-party apps can also take advantage of the Camera Control button.\nAs of iOS 18.2, Camera Control can be used for visual intelligence a new AI feature that can tell users about objects and places. Point the camera at an object and click and hold on Camera Control to get more info about it. For a restaurant, visual intelligence shows information like hours and menu.\nThe 48-megapixel Fusion camera has a faster quad-pixel sensor. Like the prior iPhone 15 Pro camera, there's a 24-megapixel default image resolution that offers high-quality images at a practical file size. The Fusion camera can be adjusted to different focal lengths, including 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm, and there's an option to capture 48-megapixel HEIF images that take up less space than RAW images.\nThere's a new 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera that lets in more light for crisper photos in macro mode. Both iPhone 16 Pro models have the upgraded 5x Telephoto lens that uses a tetraprism design this year.\nThere are a range of next-generation Photographic Styles that let users adjust color, highlights, and shadows in real time. Adjustments can be applied to specific colors rather than the entire image, and Apple allows granular control over the intensity and tone of effects. Styles can be rendered during live preview or added after a photo is taken.\nThe quad-pixel sensor can read data 2x faster, enabling zero shutter lag for 48MP ProRAW or HEIF images. It also brings 4K 120 fps video recording in Dolby Vision, a first for a smartphone. 4K 120 fps video can be taken in video or Slo-mo mode, and playback speed can be adjusted after capture. Along with spatial videos, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max can also take spatial photos for the Vision Pro.\nVideos are captured with Spatial Audio for more immersive sound with AirPods or Vision Pro, and there's a new Audio Mix feature for adjusting sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like a video was recorded in a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in front and environmental noises in surround sound. A wind noise reduction tool cuts down on unwanted noise for improved audio quality, and the iPhone 16 Pro has studio quality microphones for more true-to-life audio.\nThe new A18 Pro chip is built on a second-generation 3-nanometer node with smaller transistors for better efficiency and performance. It has a 6-core CPU with two efficiency cores and four performance cores, along with an upgraded 6-core GPU. There's a 16-core Neural Engine optimized for machine learning tasks and Apple Intelligence features, and there's a 17 percent increase in total system memory bandwidth. Next-generation ML accelerators are optimized for Apple Intelligence and handle high-efficiency, high-throughput and low-latency computations on the CPU without engaging the Neural Engine.\nThe CPU is up to 15 percent faster than the A17 Pro CPU, and the GPU is up to 20 percent faster. The internal design was rearchitected with a new aluminum substructure and back glass optimization to improve heat dissipation and chip performance. With the new thermal design and the A18 Pro chip improvements, the A18 Pro supports up to 20 percent better sustained performance. Hardware-accelerated ray tracing is up to 2x faster.\nAs with the last several generations, the iPhone 16 models support 5G connectivity (both sub-6GHz and mmWave in the United States). In the United States, iPhone models again ship without a physical SIM card as carriers now use eSIM. Faster and more efficient Wi-Fi 7 connectivity is supported, as is Bluetooth 5.3.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback?

If you need more storage space, there are options to upgrade to higher storage capacities at an additional cost.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max can be ordered from the online Apple Store, Apple retail stores, carriers, and other authorized third-party retailers. The new iPhone 16 models launched on Friday, September 20.\nReviews\niPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max reviews have been mixed, with some reviewers describing the devices as iterative and others believing that features like larger displays and a Camera Control are solid upgrades.\nMost reviews do agree that the iPhone 16 Pro models are still a work in progress, as the first Apple Intelligence features are not available to the public until iOS 18.1 in October, and additional Camera Control capabilities will be enabled in a software update coming later this year.\nIf you have an iPhone 13 or older, upgrading to an iPhone 16 Pro is very worthwhile, as you will also get past changes such as a USB-C port, the Dynamic Island, and the Action button. With the full set of Apple Intelligence features not expected to be released until mid-2025, however, waiting for the iPhone 17 series is also understandable.\nRead our iPhone 16 Pro review roundup for more information.\nDesign\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max feature an updated design with larger display sizes and a reduction in bezel size. Apple says the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have the thinnest borders of any Apple product to date.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch display, up from 6.1 inches in the prior-generation model. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a larger 6.9-inch display, up from 6.7 inches.\nBoth models are slightly taller, wider, and heavier. The iPhone 16 Pro is 5.89 inches (149.6 mm) tall and 2.81 inches (71.5 mm) wide, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is 6.42 inches (160.9 mm) tall and 3.06 inches (77.6 mm) wide. Both models are 0.32 inches (8.25 mm) thick, with the iPhone 16 Pro weighing 7.03 ounces (199 grams) and the iPhone 16 Pro Max weighing 7.81 ounces (221 grams).\nLast year's iPhone 15 Pro was 5.77 inches (146.6 mm) tall, 2.78 inches (70.6 mm) wide, and 0.32 inches (8.25 mm) thick, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max was 6.29 inches (159.9 mm) tall, 3.02 inches (76.7 mm) wide, and 0.32 inches (8.25 mm) thick.\nOther than the size, the design has not changed much, with the devices having the same general design as the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Apple is still using a titanium frame to enclose the glass front and back. Titanium is a lightweight material that's resistant to scratches and dings, with Apple bonding the bands to an internal aluminum frame for strength and durability.\nA brushed, matte finish is obtained using precision machining, sanding, brushing, and blasting. The titanium iPhone models are available in four colors this year: white titanium, black titanium, natural titanium, and desert titanium, a shade of gold.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have an all-glass front protected by second-generation Ceramic Shield material, which is stronger than the prior-generation Ceramic Shield and 2x tougher than other smartphone glass. There continues to be a pill-shaped Dynamic Island at the top of the display that houses the TrueDepth camera equipment.\nA set of antenna bands is located at the top and sides of the phone, and there is a power button on the right side and volume buttons and a customizable Action button on the left. Below the power button, there's a new Camera Control button used for capturing photos and videos. Apple removed the distinct 5G mmWave antenna, and it is now built into the frame of the iPhone 16 Pro. Note that 5G mmWave is limited to U.S. iPhone 16 models.\nSpeaker holes, a microphone, and a USB-C charging port are located at the bottom of the iPhone 16 Pro models. In some countries, there is a SIM slot, but the physical SIM has not been included in U.S. iPhones for several years now.\nThe camera bump at the back of the iPhone 16 Pro is largely unchanged, and it features a triple-lens setup for the Fusion, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto cameras along with a True Tone flash, LiDAR Scanner, and microphone.\nUSB-C Port\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models have a USB-C port, allowing them to be charged with a USB-C cable. They charge at speeds up to 30W, and can fast charge, which is equivalent to 50 percent battery in 30 minutes with a 20W or better power adapter.\nUSB-C allows an iPhone to directly charge AirPods or an Apple Watch using a USB-C cable, and the iPhone is able to provide up to 4.5W.\nThe USB-C port supports USB3 data transfer speeds of 10Gb/s, and there has been no upgrade since last year. To get the 10Gb/s transfer speeds, you'll need an appropriate USB-C cable, and the one Apple includes is limited to USB 2 speeds.\nWater and Dust Resistance\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have an IP68 rating for resistance to water and dust intrusion. The smartphones are able to withstand a depth of up to six meters (19.7 feet) for up to 30 minutes.\nIn the IP68 number, the 6 refers to dust resistance (and means the iPhone 16 can hold up to dirt, dust, and other particulates), while the 8 pertains to water resistance. IP6x is the highest dust resistance rating that exists. With the IP68 rating, the iPhone 16 can withstand splashes, rain, and accidental water exposure, but intentional water exposure should be avoided.\nWater and dust resistance are not permanent conditions, according to Apple, and can deteriorate over time as a result of normal wear. Apple's standard warranty does not cover liquid damage, which means it's best to use caution when it comes to liquid exposure.\nAction Button\nThe Action button on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max debuted in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max in 2023, and it replaces the Ring/Silent switch above the volume buttons on the left side. Apple designed the Action button to be customizable, and it can be set to perform one of several different actions in the Settings app.\n- Focus: Activate or deactivate a Focus mode (Do Not Disturb is the default).\n- Camera: Take a photo (the default), a selfie, video, portrait, or portrait selfie.\n- Flashlight: Turn the flashlight on or off.\n- Voice Memos: Start or stop recording a voice memo with the Voice Memos app.\n- Magnifier: Activate the Magnifier app to use the iPhone's camera as a magnifying glass to zoom in on small text or objects.\n- Control Center: Choose a Control Center control like turning on Dark Mode or opening the Remote app for the Apple TV.\n- Shortcuts: Open your favorite app, or run a shortcut created in or downloaded from the Shortcuts app, such as sending a message, playing a playlist, or controlling smart home devices.\n- Silent Mode: Like the Ring/Silent switch on existing iPhone models, toggle silent mode on or off, which mutes or unmutes the ringer and alerts.\n- Translate: There is a Translate action that launches the Translate app and start a text or conversation translation.\n- Accessibility: Access to various Vision settings (Classic Invert, Color Filters, Detection Mode, Increase Contrast, Reduce Motion, Reduce Transparency, Reduce White Point, Smart Invert, VoiceOver, Zoom) Motor settings (Switch Control, Voice Control, Full Keyboard Access, AssistiveTouch, Apple Watch Mirroring, Control Nearby Devices) Hearing settings (Background Sounds, Left/Right Balance, Live Captions) and General settings (Guided Access, Live Speech).\n- No Action.\nActivating the Action button is done with a long press, which limits it from being hit accidentally.\nDisplay\nWith the exception of display size, Apple didn't make notable changes to the display quality and feature set. The displays are larger, and the bezels are slimmer for more available screen space.\nBoth models still feature a Super Retina XDR OLED display with Dynamic Island. The iPhone 16 Pro has a resolution of 2868 by 1230 with 460 pixels per inch, while the iPhone 16 Plus has a resolution of 2622 by 1206 with 460 pixels per inch.\nTypical maximum brightness is 1000 nits, while peak HDR brightness is 1600 nits. Apple also says that the iPhone 16 Pro models can reach 2000 nits peak brightness outdoors. New this year is a 1 nit minimum brightness, useful for the Always-On display.\nThere is a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio, and wide color support offers vivid, true-to-life colors, while True Tone matches the white balance of the display to the ambient lighting for a paper-like viewing experience that's easier on the eyes. There's also a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating and support for Haptic Touch, which provides haptic feedback when interacting with the display.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max support a 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate and have an Always-On display, features that are not available in the standard iPhone 16 models. 120Hz maximum refresh rates allow for smoother scrolling when viewing webpages and improvements for video, while the Always-On display leaves the time, notifications, and some widgets visible even when the iPhone is locked.\nThe display is protected by a next-generation Ceramic Shield material made by infusing nano-ceramic crystals into glass. The new Ceramic Shield is stronger than the prior version, and Apple says it is \"2x tougher\" than any other smartphone glass. Despite the new Ceramic Shield, the iPhone 16 models are still vulnerable to damage when dropped.\nDynamic Island\nThe Dynamic Island includes the TrueDepth camera sensor for Face ID and the front-facing camera. The display has a small circular cutout on the right side that's for the camera, and a pill-shaped cutout on the left side for the TrueDepth system for Face ID. Apple uses software to combine the two cutouts into one pill-shaped cutout that makes up the Dynamic Island.\nApple turned the Dynamic Island into part of the iPhone's interface, and it is used as a front-and-center information hub for notifications and other at-a-glance information from apps and services. When you make an Apple Pay payment, for example, Dynamic Island expands into a square shape to confirm your Face ID scan, and when on a phone call, it expands so you have phone controls at your fingertips.\nThe Dynamic Island can display everything from Maps directions to Apple Music, and it integrates with Live Activities. There are no changes to the Dynamic Island with the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nTrueDepth Camera and Face ID\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models continue to use Face ID, Apple's facial recognition system. Face ID is baked into the Dynamic Island.\nFace ID is used across iOS for unlocking the iPhone, allowing access to passcode-protected apps, confirming app purchases, authenticating Apple Pay payments, and more.\nFace ID works through a set of sensors and cameras. A Dot Projector projects tens of thousands of invisible infrared dots onto the surface of the skin to create a 3D facial scan that maps the curves and planes of each face, with the scan read by an infrared camera.\nThe facial depth map is relayed to the A18 Pro chip where it is transformed into a mathematical model that the iPhone uses to authenticate identity. Face ID works in low light and in the dark, and with hats, beards, glasses, sunglasses, scarves, masks, and other accessories that partially obscure the face.\nFront-Facing Camera\nThe Dynamic Island also houses the front-facing camera, and Apple is using the same 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an \u0192/1.9 aperture that's been in iPhones for the last several years.\nThe front-facing camera supports Night mode, Smart HDR 5 integration, Dolby Vision HDR recording, Deep Fusion to bring out fine details, a Photonic Engine that improves low-light performance, and a portrait feature that lets you take images and turn them into portrait shots later.\n4K video recording, QuickTake video, slo-mo video, Portrait mode, Portrait Lighting, and the Photographic Styles feature for selectively applying edits are also supported on the front-facing camera.\nA18 Pro Chip\nThe A18 Pro chip is built using a second-generation 3-nanometer process, so it is more efficient and faster than the A17 Pro Bionic chip used in the iPhone 15 Pro models. The A18 Pro chip is capable of handling Apple Intelligence tasks, and it runs the Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.\nThere's a 6-core CPU with four performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 6-core GPU and an upgraded 16-core Neural Engine optimized for running large generative models. Apple has also upgraded the memory subsystem with 17 percent more memory bandwidth.\nThe A18 Pro's CPU is up to 15 percent faster than the A17 Pro CPU, and it is able to deliver the same performance using 20 percent less power. It is the fastest CPU in any smartphone to date, according to Apple, and it features next-generation ML accelerometers that are directly programmable for high-efficiency, high throughput and low latency computations.\nThe GPU is up to 20 percent faster than the GPU in the A17 Pro, and hardware accelerated ray tracing is 2x faster for gaming improvements. The Neural Engine is also faster and more efficient, and Apple says that Apple Intelligence features run 15 percent faster on the A18 Pro than the A17 Pro.\nThe A18 Pro also features a new advanced display engine for ProMotion, a new video encoder, and a new image signal processor. Combined, they process twice the amount of data for fast video encoding and improved efficiency.\nNew Thermal Design\nApple introduced a new thermal design for the iPhone 16 Pro models. Apple says that the iPhone 16 Pro maximizes thermal capacity with a machined chassis that uses 100 percent recycled aluminum.\nThe chassis is bonded to the titanium frame using solid state diffusion, and it is combined with a new graphite clad aluminum substructure. The new thermal architecture brings a 20 percent improvement in sustained gaming performance compared to the A17 Pro.\nMemory\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have 8GB RAM, the minimum needed for Apple Intelligence.\nStorage Space\nThe iPhone 16 Pro starts with 128GB of storage, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max starts with 256GB. Both can be upgraded to a maximum of 1TB of storage.\nCamera Control\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models are equipped with a Camera Control button on the right side that's designed for capturing images and video, and it is modeled after the shutter button on DSLR cameras. The multi-function Camera Control button has a force sensor and a touch sensor for gesture support, and Apple designed it to work in either portrait or landscape mode.\nA sapphire crystal with a smooth texture covers the Camera Control button, and it is surrounded by stainless steel trim. It is inset into the iPhone's frame just a bit, and the force sensor has haptic feedback to provide gesture feedback.\nCamera Control can be used to take a photo with two quick clicks, but there are many more capabilities.\n- Single click - Open up the Camera app (or a third-party app).\n- Single click, Camera open - Take a photo.\n- Click and hold - Open Camera app, start a video recording.\n- Light press - Open up controls like zoom. This button also lock focus and exposure for reframing shots without losing focus.\n- Double light press - Bring up the camera preview menu to choose different controls like exposure or depth of field.\n- Swipe - Swap through available adjustment options, and also change parameters like zoom, exposure, or depth of field when a control is selected.\nThe button has deep software support, so you can also swap between Camera control functions without having to adjust settings in the Camera app.\n- Adjust zoom\n- Adjust exposure\n- Adjust depth of field\n- Swipe through different stylistic options\nThird-party developers can take advantage of the Camera Control for their apps for adjusting settings, and it works in social media apps like Snapchat.\nVisual Intelligence\nAs of iOS 18.2, Camera Control works with a new visual intelligence feature. Users can open the Camera app and point it at an object to get information about that object with a click and hold gesture. Pointing it at a restaurant, for example, brings up hours and ratings, while pointing it at a plant identifies the plant. Using visual intelligence with something that has a date, such as a flyer, adds the date to the Calendar app.\nCamera Control works as a gateway to third-party tools, such as when users want to search Google for an item to buy or use ChatGPT to solve a problem.\nTriple-Lens Rear Camera\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models have a 48-megapixel \"Fusion\" camera, a new name that Apple is using for the Main camera. There is no improvement to the \u0192/1.78 aperture or second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization, but Apple says there is a new second-generation quad-pixel sensor.\nThe lens supports 24-megapixel and 48-megapixel high-resolution images that can be saved in RAW format or HEIF. Like last year, the Fusion camera can be set to 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths, mirroring some of what's possible with a DSLR.\nThese different focal lengths can be tapped when taking a photo and are reflected as different zoom levels, with Apple using the Fusion camera for 2x zoom. Apple says that the triple-lens camera and the different Fusion camera options are the equivalent of having seven lenses in your pocket.\nThere's a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, up from 12 megapixels, and it has with an \u0192/2.2 aperture. Like the Fusion camera, Apple uses pixel binning to combine the data from four pixels into one pixel, allowing for images with more detail and a lens that performs better in low light. The Ultra Wide camera is also used for macro shots, so the improvement means you can get more detailed macro photos.\nBoth the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have a Telephoto lens that supports 5x zoom. Apple says the 5x zoom lens uses tetraprism technology that reflects the light four times over, allowing for a longer focal length. Apple is using 3D sensor-shift optical image stabilization for the Telephoto lens, and because it is able to move in three directions, it delivers twice as many microadjustments as before for crisp photos even when zoomed all the way in.\nNew Photographic Styles\nPhotographic Styles have been an option for some time, but Apple overhauled the feature this year. There are new, more subtle styles to choose from, and Apple is enabling far more control over the way the style is applied.\nPhotographic Styles can be previewed live before you make a change. You can shift the way a style looks with the control pad that lets you adjust tone and color. The intensity of specific colors and the tone can be changed, so you can make adjustments that don't affect the entire color scheme of an image.\nApple says that skin tone rendering is more advanced than before, so you can also create a style for dialing in your favorite look and then add it across all of the images that you take. You can also change the Photographic Style after an image is captured, which wasn't an option with prior models.\nVideo Capabilities\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max offer up to 4K video recording at 24, 25, 30, 120 frames per second. HDR recording, ProRes video, Cinematic mode, Action mode, slo-mo video, and time-lapse are all supported.\nThe option for 120 fps 4K Dolby Vision video recording is a new feature, and it is available in video mode or slo-mo. Playback speed can be adjusted after capture in iOS 18, so you can film in 120 fps and then drop it down to 24 fps for a more cinematic effect. There are several speed options to choose from.\nApple included four studio-quality microphones for higher-quality recording. Apple says there's a lower noise floor for more true-to-life sounds. Spatial Audio capture also makes videos sound more immersive when listening with AirPods.\nApple also added a new wind noise reduction feature to cut down on wind sounds when recording video.\nAudio Mix\nAudio Mix is a video feature that takes advantage of Spatial Audio capture. You can use it to adjust the way that voices sound in videos, and there are three different options.\n- In-frame - Only captures the voices of people on camera, even if people off camera are talking.\n- Studio - Makes voices sound like the recording was done in a professional studio with sound-dampening walls. A recording sounds like the mic was close to the subject's mouth.\n- Cinematic - Captures all voices and consolidates them to the front of the screen, which is how sound is formatted for movies.\n- Portrait Features - You don't need to choose Portrait mode before capturing an image to get a portrait shot. You can just snap a photo, and if there's a person or a pet, depth information is collected and Portrait mode is enabled automatically with a blurred background. This year, the feature works for Night mode shots and it supports Portrait Lighting.\n- Smart HDR 5 - Recognizes one or more people in a scene and optimizes contrast, lighting, and even skin tones for each person so everyone looks their best.\n- Photonic Engine - The Photonic Engine combines the best pixels from a high-resolution image and an image optimized for light capture, leading to a 24-megapixel image with detail drawn from an image twice the resolution.\n- Night mode - Takes a series of images over a few seconds and aggregates them to allow for photography in extreme low lighting situations.\n- Spatial Video and Photos - Videos and photos captured in spatial mode can be viewed in 3D on the Vision Pro.\n- Deep Fusion - Works in mid to low lighting conditions and brings out the texture and detail in the image.\n- Portrait Lighting - Changes the lighting of Portrait mode photos with effects that include Natural, Studio, Contour, Stage, Stage Mono, and High-Key Mono.\n- True Tone flash - True Tone flash is the built-in flash, and it is designed to match the ambient lighting so it doesn't throw off the white balance of the photo when used.\n- Cinematic mode - A video mode that keeps the focus on the main subject that you're filming even as you move.\n- Action mode - Enhances image stabilization to improve shaky handheld video.\n- Panorama - Captures panoramic shots up to 63 megapixels.\n- Burst mode - Allows a series of images to be captured all at once, which is good for high-action shots.\nOther Camera Features\nThere are several other camera bells and whistles that Apple has been adding to the iPhones over the years.\nBattery Life\nWith efficiency improvements brought by the A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max have notably longer battery life than the prior-generation models, with gains of several hours.\n- iPhone 16 Pro - Up to 27 hours video playback, 22 hours streaming video, 85 hours audio.\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max - Up to 33 hours video playback, 29 hours streaming video, 105 hours audio.\n- iPhone 15 Pro - 23 hours video playback, 20 hours streaming video, 75 hours audio.\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max - 29 hours video playback, 25 hours streaming video, 95 hours audio.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro has a 3,582 mAh battery, a 9.4 percent increase over the iPhone 15 Pro, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 4,685 mAh battery, up 6 percent compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nMagSafe Charging\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models support faster 25W MagSafe charging with one of Apple's new MagSafe chargers and a 30W power adapter or higher. It is the first time that fast charging has been available when charging wirelessly, and iPhone 16 Pro users can expect to see a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes.\nQi2 charging is also supported, but that is limited to 15W, the same as the prior-generation MagSafe charging.\n5G Connectivity\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models are equipped with Qualcomm's SDX71M modem, which is a custom version of the SDX70M that Apple used last year. Tests suggest that the iPhone 16 Pro models have up to 26 percent faster 5G speeds than the iPhone 15 Pro models.\nIn addition to speed improvements enabled by 5G carrier aggregation, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 chip supports 5G Advanced technology, plus it cuts down on power consumption.\nIn the United States, iPhone owners can connect to both mmWave and sub-6GHz networks, while other countries are limited to sub-6GHz. mmWave 5G networks are the fastest 5G networks, but mmWave is short-range and can be obscured by buildings, trees, and other obstacles, so its use is limited to major cities and urban areas along with venues like stadiums, airports, and other places where a lot of people congregate.\nSub-6GHz 5G is more widespread and available in urban, suburban, and rural areas across the United States and other countries. For the most part, when you use a 5G network, you'll be using sub-6GHz 5G. Sub-6GHz 5G is typically faster than LTE, especially when mid-band spectrum is used, but it isn't always the blazing fast 5G that you expect.\n5G Bands\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models in the United States support more than 20 5G bands. The following bands are supported:\n- Sub-6GHz 5G - High band FDD-5G NR (n1, n2, n3, n5, n7, n8, n12, n14, n20, n25, n26, n28, n29, n30, n66, n70, n71, n75, n76) and low band TDD-5G NR (n38, n40, n41, n48, n53, n77, n78, n79)\n- mmWave 5G - n258, n260, n261\nLTE Bands\nThe iPhone 16 models continue to offer Gigabit LTE with 4x4 MIMO for connecting to LTE networks when 5G is unavailable. The following bands are supported.\n- FDD-LTE - (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71)\n- TDD-LTE - (Bands 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, 53)\nEmergency SOS via Satellite\nAll iPhone 16 models can connect to satellites in emergency situations when cellular and Wi-Fi connections are not available. Apple has designed the new Emergency SOS via satellite feature to allow the iPhone's antennas to connect to satellites operated by Globalstar.\nSatellite communications are available in emergency situations where you can't connect to Wi-Fi or a cellular tower, and the feature is designed to be used in open spaces with few trees so the iPhone can connect to a satellite that's in the sky.\nApple has a walkthrough interface that instructs you how to hold the iPhone to connect to a satellite, and the company has developed a compressed messaging protocol because sending data via satellite can take minutes. In an area with no trees, a short message to emergency services can send in as little as 15 seconds.\nEmergency SOS via satellite provides a series of important questions that you answer when it is activated, with these questions aimed at getting necessary details to emergency personnel as quickly as possible. The answers that you provide are sent directly to emergency services if text communication is supported in your area, or sent to relay centers staffed by Apple-trained specialists who can call emergency services on the user's behalf.\nSatellite connectivity is mainly designed to allow users to contact emergency services in dire situations, but it can also be used to update your Find My location if you're camping or hiking off the grid, giving your family and friends peace of mind about where you are.\nEmergency SOS via satellite is free for all iPhone 16 users for two years, and Apple has not yet provided details on what it will cost in the future.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models also support Messages via satellite with iOS 18, and Roadside Assistance via satellite, which allows iPhone users to contact local service providers for help if they have car trouble in an area without cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity. There is no charge for the satellite usage with Roadside Assistance, there is a fee charged by the roadside service provider.\nCrash Detection\nThere's a high dynamic range gyroscope and a dual-core accelerometer capable of detecting G-force measurements of up to 256Gs in the iPhone 16 Pro models, and paired with other iPhone sensors like a barometer that can detect cabin pressure changes caused by deployed airbags, this hardware enables a Crash Detection feature.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services when the car's occupants are seriously injured or unable to reach their phones. The GPS in the iPhone is able to detect speed changes, and the microphone is able to recognize loud sounds associated with severe car crashes. Crash Detection is also available on the Apple Watch, and the iPhone and Apple Watch work together to contact emergency services when an accident occurs.\nBluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, GPS, and Ultra Wideband\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max support Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) with 2x2 MIMO, and Bluetooth 5.3. Wi-Fi 7 adds support for 6GHz bands on supported Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers. Compared to prior Wi-Fi standards, Wi-Fi 7 is faster and supports more connections.\nThere's an NFC chip with reader mode, and a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip.
