  "title": "Trump just handed Apple a huge fiscal Q4 gift",
  "description": "President Trump signed an executive order extending the pause on a planned tariff spike for Chinese imports by another 90 days.",
  "content": "Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before: just hours before a new wave of tariffs on Chinese goods was set to kick in, President Trump signed an executive order extending the pause by another 90 days. And this time, it\u2019s especially good news for Apple.\n\nToday\u2019s move pushes the 130% tariff deadline to mid-November, giving Apple just enough breathing room to get through its fiscal Q4 without a major new cost burden.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal because Apple\u2019s fiscal Q4 runs through the end of September, which will likely include the first weeks of iPhone 17 availability.\n\nAnd while Apple has been working to shift U.S.-bound iPhone production to India, this extension gives the company some extra flexibility to source units from China if needed to meet U.S. demand.\n\nDuring Apple\u2019s Q3 2025 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said the company had taken an $800 million hit from tariffs in the quarter, $100 million less than what Apple had projected in its previous earnings report. Still, he warned of a bigger impact ahead:\n\nAs always, there\u2019s some debate over what exactly Cook meant, given the layers of conditionals in his remarks. Was he referring to no new tariffs beyond the looming 130% spike slated for today? Or was he talking about no new tariffs beyond the current 30% rate (which, as it turns out, is what held)?\n\nInterestingly, Apple\u2019s stock barely moved following the announcement and even during after-hours trading, suggesting that the market had already accounted for that possibility. Still, it will be interesting to see how the news affects Apple\u2019s stock tomorrow, if at all.\n\nBe it as it may, the fact of the matter is that Apple was just handed 90 more days of flexibility during a few of the most important weeks of the year. And beyond that, it can even start eyeing a tariff-spike-free holiday season, in case the deadline gets pushed once more in mid-November, or dropped altogether between now and then.",

  "summary": "President Trump has extended the extension of the 130% tariff threshold on Chinese goods to mid-November, giving Apple enough time to make its fiscal Q4 without significant cost burdens. This extension allows Apple to have flexibility to source units from China to meet U.S. demand. The company's CEO, Tim Cook, stated that the company had taken an $800 million hit from tariffs in Q3 2025, but warned of a larger impact due to the larger impact of additional tariffs. The news of the extension led to little movement in Apple's stock following the announcement.",

      "text": "As part of the \ufffcongoing\ufffc Q3 2025 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an update on how the U.S. tariff war is affecting the company\u2019s business, and detailed what to expect during the next fiscal quarter if nothing changes.\nOn the conference call, Cook said:\n\u201cFor the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs. For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications the balance of the quarter, and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs.\u201d\nCook noted that with policy still in flux, the market shouldn\u2019t take these estimates as a basis to make projections for future quarters.\nLast quarter, Apple provided a $900 million outlook for the tariff impact, so the $800 million figure could be seen as good news, as it shows the company was able to quickly respond to the situation, mainly with the shift of U.S.-bound iPhone production from China to India.\nApple hasn\u2019t said which products or regions were most affected by the $800 million Q3 hit, or whether the $1.1 billion expected in Q4 might be passed on to consumers, though that could still come up later in the call.\nDespite the tariff drag, Apple still posted $94.04 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 10% year over year, with iPhone, Mac, and Services all showing solid growth.\nFor the full breakdown of Apple\u2019s results, click here.\nApple Watch deals on Amazon\n- 40mm Apple Watch SE 2: $169 (was $249)\n- 42mm Apple Watch Series 10: $299 (was $399)\n- 46mm Apple Watch Series 10: $359 (was $429)\n- 49mm Apple Watch Ultra 2: $649.99 (limited time deal)\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday delayed high U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from snapping back into place for another 90 days, a White House official told CNBC.\nThose tariffs were set to resume Tuesday. But Trump signed an executive order hours beforehand that extends the deadline until mid-November, according to the official.\nThe delay was the expected outcome from the latest round of talks between U.S. trade negotiators and their Chinese counterparts, which took place in Stockholm in late July.\nIf the deadline were not extended, then U.S. duties on China would have shot back up to where they stood in April, when the tariff war between the world's largest trading nations was at its peak.\nAt that time, Trump had cranked up blanket tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, and China had retaliated with 125% duties on U.S. goods.\nBut the two sides agreed to pause most of those tariffs in May, after negotiators met for the first time in Geneva. The U.S. pared its tariffs back to 30%, and China dropped its levies to 10%.\nMonday's extension is the latest example of how Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs have shifted with little prior notice, a dynamic that has made U.S. trade policy unpredictable for many businesses.\nTrump has previously announced steep tariffs on countries or specific sectors, only to scale them back, tweak them or pause them days or weeks later.\nThe \"reciprocal tariffs\" he initially rolled out in early April, for instance, were quickly paused and then delayed multiple times before taking effect in an altered form last week.\nOn Sunday, Trump said he wanted China to \"quickly quadruple\" its orders of U.S. soybeans.\n\"This is also a way of substantially reducing China's Trade Deficit with the USA,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\nChicago soybean prices rose Monday. It was not immediately clear if China has agreed to step up its soybean purchases in response to Trump's post."
