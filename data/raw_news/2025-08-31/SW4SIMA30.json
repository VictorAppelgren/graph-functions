  "title": "3 Standout Themes That Emerged From Earnings Season",
  "description": "Tariffs are beginning to take a toll, but can the economy hold up?",
  "content": "Tariffs are beginning to take a toll, but can the economy hold up?\n\nEarnings season can give investors a glimpse into what's currently driving the market. With the bulk of the second-quarter earnings season in the rearview mirror -- more than 90% of S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.64%) companies have already reported as of this writing -- three major themes should be on every investor's radar. Let's look at each.\n\nBig tech and AI are still driving the market\n\nThe first big takeaway is that the hype around artificial intelligence (AI) is not cooling off. Megacap tech companies are still spending huge on this technology with their investments only expected to rise.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter was a great example of this theme with the company seeing strength across its businesses, all driven by AI. Its cloud computing unit, Azure, led the way, but its enterprise software business also saw strong growth as adoption of its Microsoft 365 Copilot apps accelerated. Alphabet and Amazon's cloud businesses also saw robust growth, and and all three companies said demand outstripped capacity.\n\nMeta Platforms was able to harness the power of AI to help drive strong ad revenue growth. The same was also true for Google's search business and Amazon's ad business.\n\nBig tech companies continue to lean into AI infrastructure spending. Alphabet raised its yearly capital expenditure (capex) guidance by $10 billion to $85 billion, while Microsoft said it would spend heavily on servers and graphics processing units (GPUs) in its new fiscal year to try to meet growing demand.\n\nThis, not surprisingly, is leading to robust growth in the semiconductor space. Nvidia continues to be a standout, while Advanced Micro Devices also saw strong growth outside of China. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing saw a 44% increase in revenue as it remains the market leader in manufacturing advanced chips.\n\nRight now, the impact of AI is real, and the biggest beneficiaries are the biggest companies in the tech space.\n\nThere is an interesting dichotomy in the restaurant space right now. There was a clear pullback in quick-service dining in the U.S. during the second quarter, and it affected both fast-food and fast-casual chains.\n\nThe fast-food space was more of a mixed bag. Yum Brands saw its U.S. same-store sales (comps) sink 5% for the KFC and Pizza Hut brands, while its Taco Bell division saw a 4% increase. McDonald's U.S. comps were strong, rising 2.5%, as it leaned into value offerings.\n\nHowever, other brands were weaker with Wendy's seeing a 3.6% decline in U.S. comps and a 7.1% decrease for Jack in the Box. Both Wendy's and McDonald's called out breakfast as being weak spots.\n\nThe usually more resilient fast-casual category struggled in the second quarter too. Chipotle Mexican Grill saw a surprising 4.0% decline in comps, while Cava Group's results came up well short of expectations. Sweetgreen's comps plunged 7.6%.\n\nSurprisingly, though, casual restaurants were seeing robust results. Chili's, owned by Brinker International, led the way with comps up 23.7%, driven by strong traffic, positive mix, and price increases. Dine Equity reported 4.9% comps growth for its Applebee's chain, while Darden's Olive Garden saw comps increase 6.9%.\n\nRight now, the economy appears to be weighing on lower-income consumers, who are shifting to value options as a result. This is an environment in which McDonald's has typically been able to shine compared to the competition.\n\nMore interesting, though, is the shift being seen between fast-casual and casual dining. With prices for fast-casual chains up quite a bit over the past few years, specialists in casual dining, led by Chili's, have been able to lean into value promotions and viral marketing to draw in younger customers. It's working and taking market share away from fast-casual stalwarts. This is an interesting dynamic to keep an eye on.\n\nTariffs are starting to bite across industries\n\nThe last big theme this earnings season is the growing drag from tariffs. One of the hardest-hit sectors was the auto industry. Both General Motors and Ford Motor Company absorbed huge tariff bills, although both were confident in their strategies to mitigate the impact.\n\nConsumer staple companies are also feeling the effect. For example, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive both flagged tariffs and rising costs as pressure points. That means these companies need to actively manage prices and cut costs just to keep operating margins in line.\n\nRetailers added their own perspective. Walmart had a strong quarter, but management discussed how the impact of tariffs would start to flow through to consumers as it began replenishing more inventory.\n\nWhat stands out is how broad the impact is becoming. It's not just automakers or niche industries; tariffs are affecting nearly all of them. The big question is: How much will tariffs hurt the consumer down the line, and could they drag the economy into a downturn?",

      "text": "Operating margin measures the percentage of revenue a company keeps as operating profit. This is an important metric because it indicates to investors the profitability of a business and offers a convenient way to compare competing businesses or different industries.\nWhat is operating margin?\nWhat is operating margin?\nTo understand operating margin, sometimes called operating profit margin, first let's define operating profit. Operating profit equals revenue minus the cost of goods sold and operating expenses, which typically include selling, general, and administrative costs; sales and marketing; research and development; and depreciation and amortization. EBIT, or earnings before interest and taxes, is sometimes used as stand-in terminology for operating income.\nOperating margin differs from net profit margin, which is the bottom line figure, because net profit subtracts for expenses like interest and taxes in addition to non-core business activities like gains or losses on investments and revaluations of debt. Because operating margin is much more consistent across reporting periods than net profit margin, it's a better reflection of the strength of the underlying business.\nGross margin, also distinct from operating margin, is another important profitability ratio investors should know. Gross margin is the measure of gross profit divided by revenue, with gross profit equal to revenue minus the cost of goods sold.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate operating margin\nThe simple equation to calculate operating margin is:\nOperating Margin = (Operating Income / Net Sales) x 100\nLet's take a look at a real-world example from Apple's (AAPL -0.19%) financial statements to demonstrate how to easily compute the operating margin of any company. The chart below shows results from Apple's fiscal 2021 first quarter.\n| Revenue | $111.4 billion |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $67.1 billion |\n| Gross profit | $44.3 billion |\n| Gross margin | 39.8% |\n| Operating expenses | |\n| Research and development | $5.2 billion |\n| Selling, general, and administrative expenses | $5.6 billion |\n| Operating profit | $33.5 billion |\n| Operating margin | 30.2% |\nIn the example above, Apple's operating margin of 30.2% is found by dividing its operating profit of $33.5 billion by its revenue of $111.4 billion and multiplying that amount by 100. The company's operating margin is lower than its gross margin because operating margin accounts for fixed expenses like research and marketing that do not vary with manufacturing output.\nAs you can see, Apple's operating margin is phenomenal at more than 30% and just 9.6% below its gross margin. This operating margin shows the strength of the company's business and illustrates why it's one of the most valuable companies in the world.\nRelated investing topics\nWhat operating margin doesn't tell you\nWhat operating margin doesn't tell you\nEven though knowing a company's operating margin is helpful, it doesn't account for every expense the company bears. One-time restructurings, impairments, and other charges are also typically missing from operating income, as are income tax expenses. Interest cash flows and any impacts, positive or negative, from foreign currency exchange are also accounted for farther down the income statement.\nA company's operating margin also doesn't tell you anything about its growth rate. Fast-growing companies often have low or even negative operating margins because they are spending aggressively on initiatives like marketing and product development to expand the business and reinvesting any profits back into the company. Conversely, a low-growth business such as tobacco giant Altria (MO 1.17%) is likely to have a comparatively high operating margin since the company and industry are both mature. It's important to consider operating margin as just one metric among other considerations such as the industry and the company's growth.\nStill, calculating operating margin is the best way to get a sense of a company's or a core business unit's profitability. You can compare operating margins for the same company across multiple time periods and also compare operating margins for different companies in the same industry.\nOperating margins are a simple concept, but they convey a lot of information. By giving you a deeper understanding of an income statement, operating margins serve a valuable purpose for all stock investors."

      "text": "Understanding financial terms is essential to being a successful investor, and that includes understanding the three financial statements: the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.\nOn the cash flow statement, one of the most important components is capital expenditures.\nWhat does capital expenditures mean?\nWhat does capital expenditures mean?\nCapital expenditures, often called capex, are often listed on the cash flow statement as payments for property and equipment under cash flows from investing activities.\nAs the name implies, this is spending on capital goods and projects, as opposed to operating expenses.\nWhat qualifies as a capital expenditure?\nWhat qualifies as a capital expenditure?\nCapital expenditures often refers to spending on buildings and maintenance that are essential parts of most businesses. For example, a retailer like Walmart (WMT 0.88%) spends billions on capex to ensure that its stores are clean and up to date. A tech company like Meta Platforms (META -1.69%) or Amazon (AMZN -1.16%) might spend billions on capex, building out new data centers or filling existing ones.\nA capital expenditure is typically depreciated or amortized, as opposed to an operating expense, which is expensed.\nThat's an important distinction that you should be aware of when evaluating a business. Operating expenses typically refer to the direct spending needed to run a business. For example, at a restaurant, operating expenses would refer to labor costs, food costs, and occupancy costs like rent and utilities, as well as things like marketing expenses and even research and development. Capex would refer to spending on items such as building maintenance, new store buildouts, and other infrastructure.\nCapital expenditures don't affect the income statement directly, but they affect the cash flow statement -- the free cash flow statement, in particular, which is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.\nFree Cash Flow (FCF)\nHow to use capital expenditures\nHow to use capital expenditures\nBecause capital spending isn't \"required\" in the way that operating expenses are, businesses have more flexibility on the timing of capex, so it's worth paying attention to see if businesses are cutting back on spending to conserve cash.\nCapital expenditures also give a sense of how aggressively a business is investing in growth. Comparing capital spending between companies can offer information on which one is spending more on growth. It's worth looking at the percentage of revenue going to capital expenditures, for example. A company that's spending more than its competitors could be preparing to outgrow them, although it could also be spending on capital inefficiently. Still, it's worth investigating why a company is increasing capex since it could be paving the way to a growth opportunity for the company.\nWall Street often punishes stocks for increasing spending on capex since they see it as eating into profits. As long as the money is spent wisely, however, it generally pays off in long-term profits and growth. It's a good idea to look for unloved stocks that are raising capital expenditures.\nRelated investing topics\nWhat's an example of a capital expenditure?\nWhat's an example of a capital expenditure?\nTo explore what capital expenditures look like in a real business, let's take a look at capital expenditures for Walmart in its most recent fiscal year.\nIn fiscal 2023, which ended on Jan. 31, 2023, Walmart spent $16.9 billion on capital expenditures. The company allocated $9.2 billion to the supply chain, including customer-facing initiatives and technology, with another $5 billion for store and club remodels and $2.6 billion for Walmart International. Only $33 million was allocated to new stores; Walmart has essentially stopped opening new stores.\nWalmart said its capex strategy includes improving customer-facing initiatives, creating a seamless omnichannel experience, and improving the supply chain.\nThe retailer has stepped up capex from $10.2 billion in fiscal 2021 to $13.1 billion in fiscal 2022 and $16.9 billion in fiscal 2023 as a result of company goals to become more competitive with Amazon on the e-commerce front and improve its tech capabilities.\nWalmart is able to fund that capex out of its operating cash flow with $28.8 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal 2023, giving it almost $12 billion in free cash flow last year. Walmart spent the remainder on dividends and share buybacks.\nUnderstanding the cash flow statement can give you key insights into a business, and capital expenditures are one of the most important components of the cash flow. It's essential to follow if you want to know how a business is spending its cash."

      "text": "Cloud computing boomed during the 2010s, but growth in this next-gen IT industry is still in the early innings. For years, organizations around the globe have been migrating their operations to the cloud -- digital data and services stored within a remote data center and accessed via the internet. However, the rise of remote work during the pandemic accelerated the trend. Now, generative AI has kicked off the next wave of cloud expansion.\nBusiness research provider Grand View Research projects that spending on global cloud computing (including data center infrastructure and edge computing) will increase at a 21.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from an estimated $752.4 billion in 2024 to $2.4 trillion in 2030.\nCloud computing is also closely tied to other tech developments such as mobile 5G networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). Clearly, cloud computing stocks are a top investment theme for 2025 and the decade ahead.\nCloud computing stocks for 2025\nInvesting in the best cloud computing stocks of 2025\nTo get started, the best cloud stocks to invest in are the five largest public cloud giants: Amazon (AMZN -1.16%) Web Services (AWS); Microsoft (MSFT -0.65%) Azure; Alphabet (GOOGL 0.63%) (GOOG 0.56%) Google Cloud; Oracle (ORCL -5.97%) Cloud; and IBM (IBM -0.88%) Cloud. Although these companies aren\u2019t pure plays in the cloud industry, all five provide infrastructure and services for organizations undertaking a digital transformation (a phrase that encompasses the migration to cloud-based operations). They have the most complete ecosystems of software and partnerships with third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.\nCloud Computing\nBeyond those big five, here are seven more focused companies that provide portfolio exposure to the development of the cloud:\n| Name and ticker | Current price | Market cap |\n|---|---|---|\n| Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) | $256.36 | $245 billion |\n| Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) | $356.32 | $151 billion |\n| Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) | $238.69 | $80 billion |\n| Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) | $81.32 | $24 billion |\n| ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) | $918.44 | $191 billion |\n| The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) | $54.68 | $27 billion |\n| DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) | $32.59 | $3 billion |\n1 - 2\n1. Salesforce\nWhen talking about cloud computing, Salesforce (CRM 0.72%) needs to be part of the conversation. The customer relationship management (CRM) specialist was a pioneer of software that used cloud technology, which started in the late 1990s. Salesforce has since branched out to other areas of enterprise software via organic growth and a steady stream of acquisitions.\nSalesforce\u2019s takeover of remote work and collaboration tool Slack put it on a collision course with Microsoft\u2019s Teams collaboration suite. Today, Salesforce offers a complete suite of software aimed at helping business teams manage data and get work done efficiently.\nDue to its success in becoming a full-blown tech platform for businesses of all types and sizes, Salesforce is also a top way to play smaller cloud upstarts. It regularly invests in or acquires stakes in smaller cloud peers -- such as when it invested in Snowflake (SNOW -0.96%) before its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020 (and sold it for a profit in 2021). It also acquired a stake in hot IPO Monday.com (MNDY 1.88%).\nSalesforce fell on hard times in 2022 and faced activist investor pressure to boost profit margins. Founder and CEO Marc Benioff and the top team have made progress, though, and hope to become the world\u2019s largest and most profitable enterprise software company within the next few years. It seems to be on the right track. Salesforce reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.21 for fiscal 2023 but booked diluted EPS of $4.20 in fiscal 2024, and management projects fiscal 2025 to be even higher: $6.15 to $6.20.\n2. Adobe\nSoftware company Adobe (ADBE 0.67%) got its start in an IT era that predates both the cloud and the internet. But it has transformed itself into a leader in cloud services by adapting its large and expanding platform to the cloud era. Adobe\u2019s core competencies in providing creativity software and document editing have made it a staple of digital transformation.\nAlthough it isn\u2019t a serial acquirer like Salesforce, Adobe has made some big moves to round out its software suite. In 2018, it acquired small firms Marketo and Magento to bolster its position as a partner for e-commerce companies. In late 2020, it purchased Workfront to add workflow and project management solutions to its arsenal.\nAs a creative software specialist, Adobe is also well suited to tackle the new generative AI era. Its work with top chip designer Nvidia (NVDA -3.38%) helped it quickly release its Firefly suite of apps aimed at helping creatives increase their image and video creation, as well as expanding editing capabilities.\nPaired with the organic growth that Adobe\u2019s legacy offerings still generate, this firm is a top free cash flow generator in the cloud industry. It deserves consideration as a core portfolio holding.\n3 - 4\n3. Snowflake\nThe cloud increases a company's flexibility, often unlocks cost savings, and helps them get more done with the data they have on their operations and customers. However, with the adoption of the cloud comes an explosion of digital data and new security risk considerations. Managing that data is a complex task.\nThat's where Snowflake comes in. It hit the public markets in 2020 with incredible fanfare due to its triple-digit-percentage revenue growth. The stock has fallen since then, and revenue growth has moderated a bit, but Snowflake is now much more reasonably valued.\nSnowflake is an important business that has pioneered new ways for businesses to store, migrate, and process massive amounts of digital information. It continued to expand at a rapid pace even during the bear market of 2022 and despite fears of a recession in 2023. It also began turning a healthy profit, as measured by free cash flow. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, for example, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $496.5 million and $778.9 million, respectively. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, moreover, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $468.6 million.\nSnowflake is a young company, though, and the stock will likely be highly volatile for some time. It's all about growth for this business right now, and even small changes in management's expectations can cause some wild fluctuations in share price. Snowflake could, nevertheless, be a very promising investment for the long term.\n4. Zoom Video Communications\nFew companies have skyrocketed out of obscurity and into household name status as quickly as Zoom (ZM 0.61%). The videoconferencing service became a staple during the COVID-19 pandemic by helping family members and business teams stay in touch from afar (as it turns out, many pre-pandemic in-person meetings weren't all that necessary after all). Zoom is poised to continue as a basic necessity of corporate communications services for a long time.\nZoom is eyeing a bigger piece of the massive global telecom industry by going after large business communications accounts. Zoom Phone accounts, a service for transferring calls across different devices, has steadily grown for years. Zoom's contact center services to manage inbound calls and customer contact have also remained a key growth initiative.\nWhile Zoom struggled with many individual and small business subscribers canceling their service in the wake of the pandemic, it has succeeded in improving its financials over the past couple of years. Growing free cash flow from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024, Zoom projects free cash flow of $1.44 billion to $1.48 billion for fiscal 2025. The company is still benefiting from changes in communications, but it's no longer a growth company. Zoom's top priority now is managing modest revenue expansion while figuring out how to steadily increase earnings for shareholders.\nArtificial Intelligence\n5 - 7\n5. ServiceNow\nThere are greater complexities involved in managing big cloud computing infrastructure, but the cloud also offers the ability to continuously streamline and automate operations. That's ServiceNow's (NOW -1.09%) software specialty.\nBe it digital customer experiences, employee workflow management, or software development, ServiceNow helps about 8,400 companies around the world find chokepoints in their operations. Once these pain points are found, ServiceNow can help suggest and automate fixes.\nIn a new era of AI, ServiceNow could be a big winner, building on its recent success. After growing subscription revenue by 23% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, ServiceNow projects a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of about 19% for fiscal 2025.\nThe company is using Nvidia hardware to make automation even better and even landed Nvidia as a bigger customer using automation software that Nvidia is helping ServiceNow to create. With challenges like labor shortages persisting in the wake of the pandemic, ServiceNow is primed to keep growing.\nIn addition to steady growth, ServiceNow also recently turned profitable by all metrics. This could be a great stock holding for the next decade and beyond as the cloud infiltrates more of the world's corporate operations.\n6. The Trade Desk\nNetflix (NFLX -1.87%) made streaming TV from the cloud an everyday staple. Lots of new internet-based services have come to market in the past couple of years. This has been a boon for digital advertising technologists such as The Trade Desk (TTD -1.23%), a cloud-based offering that helps marketers automate the purchase of digital advertising (known as programmatic advertising).\nDigital ads are dominated by the likes of Google and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), but The Trade Desk\u2019s cloud-based marketing management tools have won over lots of users. It now ranks as the largest independent digital ad management software company. And its rapidly-escalating top-line growth further reflects the massive success it has achieved. From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2023, for example, The Trade Desk has grown revenue at a massive 52% CAGR.\nDespite massive internet growth in the past decade, just over half of marketing spending takes place in a digital format. Digital ads will continue to be a fast-growing industry in the next decade -- especially in at-home entertainment as TV and movies move to an on-demand internet streaming format.\nIn the coming years, streaming services will pick up millions of new household subscribers and account for billions of additional hours spent viewing content. That creates a huge opportunity for The Trade Desk as it manages connected TV advertising activity. Still a small company in a global marketing industry approaching $1 trillion annually and growing, the sky\u2019s the limit for The Trade Desk.\n7. DigitalOcean\nDigitalOcean (NASDAQ:DOCN) is a fresh face in the cloud computing space. It completed its public offering of stock in early 2021. It\u2019s a public cloud infrastructure and software provider similar to Amazon\u2019s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. While the big three focus their attention on large enterprises, DigitalOcean aims at the massive but underserved community of small businesses and start-ups.\nThis is a lucrative niche. Most IT innovations are developed for and funded by large organizations. Yet small businesses still make up about half of the global economy\u2019s production. Most are far behind the curve in making needed digital transformation. That\u2019s where DigitalOcean comes in, providing a full range of affordable services to help small companies find their way in the new cloud era.\nBesides offering cloud infrastructure for small businesses to test and host web-based services and apps, it also offers services for the non-tech-savvy outfit. It acquired a company called Cloudways that offers website building and hosting.\nDespite its tiny size, DigitalOcean is an efficient operation. It generates healthy and growing free cash flow, and while it has generated gross profits for years, it booked positive net income for the first time in 2023, reporting diluted EPS of $0.20. Through the first three quarters of 2024, DigitalOcean has generated diluted EPS of $0.70. This could be a quality small- to mid-cap stock worth investing in for the long haul.\nInvesting in cloud ETFs\nInvesting in cloud ETFs\nFor investors not interested in attempting to pick the best cloud stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also an option. The First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY -1.11%) is the largest cloud ETF around, with about $3.9 billion in assets under management. The fund is a basket of 61 cloud infrastructure and software stocks. It has an ETF expense ratio of 0.6%, meaning it costs $6 per year for every $1,000 invested.\nA more recent arrival is the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU 0.09%). Since the fund launched in early 2019, GlobalX\u2019s cloud ETF has narrowly outperformed First Trust\u2019s offering due to its focus on just 37 stocks, most of which are software companies. The fund is smaller, with about $376 million in assets under management. It has a slightly higher annual expense ratio of 0.68%.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nCloud computing is a long-term growth trend\nCloud computing picked up steam during the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained an enduring growth story even during the bear market. More efficient than legacy IT, it enhances technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and gaming. It gives organizations and their employees more flexibility with important functions such as remote work. The cloud is quickly becoming the basic infrastructure of the future.\nAs is the case with all high-growth stocks, though, investing in cloud companies will have bumps in the road. Investors should stay focused on the long-term potential, not just stock price performance over the course of a year or two. This long-term secular growth trend is poised to remain intact for the next decade and beyond. Cloud stocks should be a top investment priority in 2025."

      "text": "Same-store sales is a metric used by retail companies that measures the growth in revenue from store locations that have been in operation for at least one year. Sometimes called comparable-store sales, or \"comps\" for short, it\u2019s an important metric to gauge organic growth from existing stores versus growth through store expansion. Investors ideally want to see improvements in both.\nInvestors in retail stocks should know how a company reports same-store sales, what it means for shareholders, and why analysts pay close attention to the metric. Read on to learn more.\nUnderstanding same-store sales\nUnderstanding same-store sales\nSame-store sales can tell us how much of a retailer\u2019s sales growth is organic and driven by factors at the store level. That growth could be due to increased foot traffic, increased average basket price, or a combination of those.\nSame-store sales growth is a simple number for a retailer to calculate. Revenue is taken for a given period, usually a quarter or a year, and sales are subtracted from stores operating for fewer than 12 months. Sales are then taken from the prior-year period and revenue generated by stores it no longer operates is subtracted. Dividing the first number by the second gives the same-store sales growth.\nThe number is expressed as a percentage growth rate. So if a retailer\u2019s stores generated $1 billion in sales last year, and those same stores generated $1.05 billion this year, same-store sales growth was 5%.\nWhy same-store sales are important\nWhy same-store sales are important\nStrong same-store sales are a sign of a healthy business. If a business is expanding to new locations, but its same-store sales are declining, it may be operating inefficiently. New locations could be cannibalizing old ones. The money spent on new locations may be better spent on improving operations in existing stores.\nIf same-store sales are consistently declining, it tells investors that the business has limited growth potential. You can only open so many new locations before the market is saturated. If each store can keep increasing sales year after year, the potential for revenue is unlimited.\nUltimately, strong same-store sales growth is an indicator of strong operational performance. It indicates management\u2019s ability to generate strong return on assets by using existing store properties to sell more inventory.\nManagement can use same-store sales to identify underperforming locations. It can then make decisions about how to improve sales at those stores or if it needs to close those stores.\nManagement can also use same-store sales to identify the impact of competitors opening locations near its existing stores. If a store goes from expanding sales at above-average rates to below-average levels after a competitor moves in down the street, it\u2019s an indication that it\u2019s seeing a significant impact. Likewise, management may also be able to tell if its new stores are cannibalizing older stores.\nSame-store sales may also be analyzed in the context of overall consumer spending. If consumers are spending more across both consumer staples and discretionary purchases, investors should expect to see same-store sales keep pace with the rest of the industry a retailer operates in.\nE-commerce\nExample of same-store sales\nExample of same-store sales\nTarget (TGT -0.85%) provides its investors with a breakdown of its same-store sales in each earnings report, including the impact of its growing e-commerce operations on the metric.\nHere\u2019s what the company wrote in its full-year 2021 earnings release: \u201cFull-year sales increased 13.2 percent to $104.6 billion from $92.4 billion last year, reflecting a 12.7 percent increase in comparable sales combined with sales from non-mature stores.\u201d\nAs you can see, the bulk of Target\u2019s revenue growth came from improving sales at its existing stores. New stores, or \u201cnon-mature stores,\u201d produced a 0.5% uplift in sales for the year.\nFor reference, Target opened 29 net new stores in 2021, an increase of about 1.5%. Not all of those stores were at full operations for the entire year, so their contribution to sales growth ought to be less than 1.5%.\nTarget further breaks down how it increased same-store sales. The company saw a 12.3% increase in total transactions and a 0.4% increase in the amount shoppers spent per transaction. Target drove revenue by getting more people to shop at its stores in 2021 than in 2020.\nHowever, considering the rate of inflation, it appears shoppers spent less in real dollars per trip than they did in 2020. Should investors be concerned about that? 2020 was an interesting year, to say the least, and most shoppers tried to make as few trips to the store as possible. Therefore, fewer trips with larger baskets made sense for 2020, and that trend reversed in 2021. Target\u2019s same-store sales growth still handily beat the rate of inflation.\nTarget also breaks out the impact of digital sales on its comparable-store sales metric. When removing the impact of 20.8% growth in digital sales, same-store sales increased 11% in 2021. That\u2019s another great insight into how well the physical stores are performing.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on same-store sales\nUnderstanding same-store sales and how this metric is impacted by various factors is important when analyzing any retail company. If a retailer is expanding to new locations while same-store sales growth is declining, a prospective investor needs to do some deeper analysis. It may be a short-term blip, or it may be a warning sign to stay away from the investment.\nA company producing consistently strong same-store sales growth has much more potential for long-term growth and improved profitability than a store that\u2019s only able to grow by expanding to new locations. Investors will want to find the former and avoid the latter as they research retail stocks."

      "text": "Earnings season is the time each quarter when most publicly traded companies report their quarterly or annual earnings. It is generally when most volatility happens at the individual stock level.\nLet's go over the timing of earnings season and how it can affect your investment.\nWhen is earnings season?\nWhen is earnings season?\nIn the U.S., earnings season happens quarterly, or once every three months, for public companies. In some foreign markets, it happens semiannually, or once every six months. Earnings season generally begins a few weeks after the end of the prior fiscal quarter and lasts for about six weeks.\nSome companies get their earnings together and report right away in those first few weeks, but others wait as long as two months after the quarter to release earnings. It's a lot of work to close accounts, get an audit done if it's required, and have a lawyer put together the filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If you own a wide range of stocks, it's possible that you would be in earnings season more often than not.\nHere are the general date ranges for earnings season for each quarter (note that companies with an unusual fiscal quarter may report on a different schedule):\n- First quarter (ends March 31): April 15 to May 31\n- Second quarter (ends June 30): July 15 to Aug. 31\n- Third quarter (ends Sept. 30): Oct. 15 to Nov. 30\n- Fourth quarter (ends Dec. 31): Jan. 15 to Feb. 28\nWhy is earnings season important?\nWhy is earnings season important?\nEarnings season is certainly more important for smaller, growth-oriented companies. Stodgy old stalwarts in the Dow that your grandparents have owned for 60 years probably won't see much of a bump.\nFor growth companies, the reason earnings season is so important is that the companies are still in the process of proving out a business model and potentially even a product. Quarterly earnings reporting is one of the few times during the year when the company is required to report on its progress. Analysts, investors, and the media alike await the report with bated breath to see how the progress is going.\nIt's all about expectations. Small companies can see 20% moves (in either direction) when they report quarterly earnings. At times, a small company will have a blowout quarter, and the stock will plateau or go down because the market's expectations are too high.\nPay attention to what day the company reports earnings. Some companies with poor results will do a late Friday filing and announcement to try to keep the results out of the news.\nLet's look at a few recent examples:\nNetflix (NFLX -1.87%) reported results on a Tuesday in July. You'd think Netflix would qualify as a stodgy old stalwart that your grandparents have owned for, well, 16 years by this point. But the stock market reacted strongly to the report, sending the shares down from $531 per share to $513 in one day.\nDocuSign (DOCU 1.37%) is one of the companies with a weird fiscal quarter end; its second quarter ends on July 31. DocuSign reported 50% growth in revenue, and its stock responded with a 5% jump.\nThese aren't the types of big moves many traders and investors are used to. Netflix had a meh earnings report and fell just 3%; DocuSign blew out revenue growth and jumped 5%. Both of these reports happened following years of strong upward movement for both stocks. It's possible the market is fatigued by this trend, and there just wasn't enough volume for a strong move either way.\nRelated investing topics\nHow to benefit from earnings season\nHow to benefit from earnings season\nAs long-term investors, we look at earnings season a lot differently than many traders. Quarterly earnings analysis is imperative for good fundamental investing, but trying to guess and trade around big moves on earnings day is a fool's game.\nUse earnings season to make sure your investment thesis is still valid. Read closely what a company's management says and compare it to what they do. Don't get freaked out by one or two bad quarters. If anything, use a few bad quarters by an otherwise good company as a buying opportunity if the market overreacts.\nUnderstanding earnings season is just another useful item in your toolkit as you learn to be a better investor."

      "text": "Computers excel at crunching numbers but not at tasks that many people do with ease, like language processing, visual perception, object manipulation, reasoning, planning, and learning. Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language generation and facial recognition.\nAI stocks are shares of companies that are developing or employing AI technology as part of their business. AI stocks span sectors like semiconductors, software, and even beyond tech, representing companies that are using AI in ways that set them apart from their peers.\nHow AI is used\nHow do companies use artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is created through machine learning, which involves training a system on vast amounts of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about data it's never seen.\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.\nCompanies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants.\nFor instance, AI is used by Alphabet (GOOGL 0.63%) (GOOG 0.56%) subsidiary Google to filter spam in Gmail, by Amazon (AMZN -1.16%) to recommend products to customers, and by Netflix (NFLX -1.87%) to guide content creation and recommendations.\nMore recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far generative AI -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams.\nIt has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic's Claude, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta Platforms' (META -1.69%) Meta AI. The potential is enormous.\nThe next frontier for generative AI is AI agents or agentic AI. This technology allows AI to perform and complete whole tasks without being prompted. For instance, an automated customer service agent that could handle a request without needing human assistance would be agentic AI. Salesforce's (CRM 0.72%) AgentForce is one example of a new agentic AI tool.\nSome companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.\n5 top AI stocks\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | AI Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Data center GPUs and superchips |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Generative AI and self-driving cars |\n| Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Memory chips for data centers and generative AI tools |\n| CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) | Generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure platform |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | AI chatbots, LLMs, and wearable devices |\n1. Nvidia\nLeading graphics processing unit (GPU) company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI's training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, typically requires less.\nGPU chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia's ambitions have gone beyond GPUs, as the company now aims to build AI factories or data centers full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.\nNvidia's data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company's revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI.\nRevenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well. It's been the most valuable company in the world on several occasions and was No. 1 in July 2025. It also became the first company to reach a market cap of $4 trillion. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand, and growth is expected to be strong in 2025 as well.\nNvidia's chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like large language models (LLMs) require. The pure-play chip stock is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.\nSelf-driving cars and \"physical AI\" are other areas of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company's revenue, but that could change.\nWith Tesla (TSLA -3.45%) having launched its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.\nA self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia's platform delivers.\nIts professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has potential in AI. Nvidia's chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It's also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities such as San Francisco and Phoenix.\nAlphabet launched Gemini -- its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT -- which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown, as Alphabet's ad revenue continues to grow steadily.\nThe company said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\" New features, like AI assistant and AI mode, have helped Google Search defend its market share against AI-based challenges.\nWith information at the heart of its business, it's unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It's rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.\nAI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it. Finally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures, with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft has gotten lots of buzz lately, thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.\nMicrosoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.\nCEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform. The reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of the company's conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind, as it did with mobile.\nMore recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI. It has been adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including DeepSeek's R1.\nThe long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it's wise to hedge its bets in the AI race. The relationship continues to evolve, but Microsoft sees the start-up's technology as critical for its AI strategy.\nMicrosoft is harnessing the power of AI in other ways, too, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It's also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools. It launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, enabling its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.\n4. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave, which had its initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it launched the first major AI IPO. Its cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base. Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.\nCoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost no revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. Between 2022 and 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.\nCoreWeave's business is risky since Microsoft accounts for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft were to pull back on spending with the platform. In its first-quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.\nThe company announced plans for a $6 billion data center in July. It's also acquiring Core Scientific, which will bulk up its AI infrastructure with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) in power capacity.\nIf you're looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by demand for computing power to run generative AI programs. However, the stock is risky, as CoreWeave has a high debt burden, large capital expenditures, and is deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP).\n5. Meta Platforms\nUnlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn't have a cloud computing business, but it's investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet. Meta AI, the company's chatbot, is available on its apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) and had 1 billion monthly active users as of May. Meta continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.\nIt's also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is involved in ad targeting as well, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through the devices.\nIn June, it acquired 49% of data-labeling specialist Scale AI for $14.8 billion and brought Scale CEO Alexandr Wang on to run an AI research lab at Meta. The tech giant has also made a number of smaller acquisitions in AI. Management sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas such as advertising, experiences, and devices.\nMachine learning\nMachine learning stocks\nAll the stocks above use machine learning technologies. However, if you're looking for even more options, here are two others worth considering:\nPalantir\nPalantir (PLTR -0.92%) has been one of the top-performing AI stocks. The company provides cloud software and specializes in data fusion that helps its customers make important insights by connecting disparate pieces of information hidden in data.\nIt also launched its AI Platform (AIP) in 2023, which has helped accelerate its growth. Palantir deploys machine learning models on top of data foundations and continuously improves them to ensure they become more useful.\nTesla\nTesla is best known for its electric vehicles (EVs). CEO Elon Musk sees AI as the future of the company, and machine learning and neural networks are very much at the center of the company's autonomous vehicle and Optimus autonomous robot projects.\nTesla introduced its driverless Cybercab in October 2024, and the company hopes to begin producing the vehicles by 2026. It launched its robotaxi network in June, though with just a handful of vehicles, and Musk envisions the company expanding to other cities in the near future. Musk has said Tesla's automation technology could make it the most valuable company in the world.\nDeep learning\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It's the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn't require human input.\nNvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.\nAlphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\nRelated investing topics\nA growth business\nAI is a growth business\nAccording to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028. While the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.\nFAQ\nArtificial intelligence stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best AI stock to buy?\nArtificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.\nIs it good to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The semiconductor sector can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly.\nAdditionally, there's the potential for unexpected surprises, such as the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.\nWhat is the biggest AI company?\nCurrently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a market cap that has soared past $4 trillion. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution, with components that are fueling AI applications and in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.\nIs AI good for investing?\nArtificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.\nWhat company is No. 1 in AI?\nCurrently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn't guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.\nWill AI start-ups challenge tech giants?\nTech giants aren't feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.\nThe tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth."

      "text": "It's time to peer into the heart of computer hardware to understand an essential component: the GPU. Don't worry; this won't get too technical, but understanding this term could be instrumental for your tech investments.\nWhat is a GPU?\nWhat is a GPU?\nGPU stands for \"graphics processing unit.\" This computer chip is the brain behind every visual element that your computer displays. From the colorful graphs in your stock analysis software to the latest blockbuster movie streaming on your 4k screen, the GPU is hard at work turning digital data into visible pixels.\nYou'll occasionally see the terms GPU and graphics card used as metonyms for one another. That's a useful shorthand, but not exactly right. The two pieces of hardware are closely related, and you can't make a graphics card without a GPU. So when the two terms are conflated into a single concept, it sort of makes sense. Still, they are not the same thing, technically speaking.\nThe GPU is the most important chip on a fully realized graphics card. Besides the GPU, this card also contains memory chips, a cooler, and other components. You'll also typically find them equipped with a few HDMI or DisplayPort connectors, from which the right cable can transfer the generated graphics data to a monitor (or three). Think of the graphics card as a fully functional car with the GPU being the engine powering it.\nWhy should you care about the GPU?\nWhy should you care about the GPU?\nNow, you might wonder why an investor needs to know about GPUs. Well, consider this: The same number-crunching horsepower that makes these chips so good at generating high-quality graphics in real time is also the best solution for many other high-performance computing tasks. The leading GPU designers, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -3.52%) and Nvidia (NVDA -3.38%), have moved beyond the basic market for graphics cards to explore a wider range of heavy-duty computing opportunities.\nThe hardware used in these applications is usually not consumer-grade graphics cards but specialized computing products with lots of memory and one or more GPU chips but no ports for display output. In this form, GPUs are crucially important in several high-growth technology sectors, from video games and virtual reality to artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency mining.\nGPUs have become especially essential in the AI market. Unlike CPUs (central processing units) that are great at doing a few things at once, GPUs excel at doing many things simultaneously, making them ideal for training AI models that need to process vast amounts of data quickly.\nTime to take action\nTime to take action\nKnowing about GPUs and their role in driving key technology sectors can be a real game-changer for investors. Pay attention to tech companies that design and manufacture GPUs (like Nvidia and AMD), but also to firms that rely on GPUs in their technology. For example, the GPU is of central importance to AI startups, gaming companies, and some cryptocurrency platforms.\nCrypto mining on GPUs isn't as popular as it once was. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) miners are better off using special-purpose mining chips instead, and most GPU-based mining moved to Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) many years ago.\nBut Ethereum's platform upgrade, completed in the spring of 2023, took mining out of the equation entirely. After that game-changing shift, GPU-powered crypto mining has to work with altcoins such as Ethereum Classic (ETC 1.21%), Ravencoin (RVN 0.14%), Monero (XMR -0.93%), and Zcash (ZEC 1.51%).\nThese alternatives are not as robust as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it can be difficult to trade the not-so-popular coins you're mining. So mining crypto with a GPU isn't the name of the game anymore, but crypto usage could make a comeback, and you should be aware of this sub-market's interesting history.\nUnderstanding the GPU also empowers you when assessing the effects of market events. For instance, a global chip shortage could affect GPU manufacturers, potentially driving up prices, which would ripple through sectors that rely on GPUs.\nRelated investing topics\nThe GPU in action: Training the ChatGPT system\nThe GPU in action: Training the ChatGPT system\nTo truly illustrate the importance of GPUs, let's turn to the realm of artificial intelligence. In particular, we'll look at OpenAI's large language models, GPT-3 and GPT-4. Both are powered by a large-scale machine learning model trained on a wealth of internet text, and the resulting large language models (LLMs) power the popular ChatGPT application.\nBut what does this have to do with GPUs?\nIt's simple. The training of these colossal models involves processing an astronomical amount of data, a task for which GPUs are uniquely qualified. The right chips can perform thousands of calculations simultaneously, making them crucial in creating these language models in a reasonable timeframe.\nOne of the key players in the GPU market, Nvidia, has been particularly instrumental in this development. The Nvidia A100, V100, and H100 Tensor Core GPUs, for instance, offer incredible acceleration at every scale for AI training and inference. Thanks to the AI training performed on these high-powered GPUs, the GPT-4 AI system can analyze and understand text on a near-human level.\nAMD has its Radeon Instinct accelerators designed specifically for machine learning and AI workloads. Their GPUs are also widely used across the tech industry, powering advancements in AI and machine learning. With just a handful of exceptions to the rule, almost all of the world's most powerful supercomputers were built around either Nvidia or AMD AI-oriented GPUs.\nThe deployment of these GPUs isn't limited to a shadowy server farm either. They are hard at work in everyday applications like ChatGPT, where users interact with the AI models in real time. This practical application of GPU technology shows how integral they are to advancements in AI, affecting both businesses and consumers.\nSo understanding the role of GPUs isn't just a tech concern. This understanding directly relates to evaluating companies that manufacture GPUs, like Nvidia and AMD, and businesses that heavily use them, such as OpenAI. Knowing the basic facts about GPUs will help you make more informed predictions about these companies' performance and their impact on the tech industry."

      "text": "The Trump administration has announced a variety of trade actions including tariffs and other measures that could impact U.S. imports and exports. The table below tracks the status of major trade and tariff actions and proposals, including a full list of reciprocal tariffs.\nFull August 7 reciprocal tariff list and other trade actions\nImportant trade actions investors should watch\nWhile the Trump administration has put in motion a large number of trade actions, some are more imminent and impactful than others.\nCourt of International Trade decision\nCourt of International Trade decision on reciprocal tariffs\nOn May 28, the Court of International Trade issued a decision enjoining the Trump administration's tariffs imposed via the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. That ruling was then paused by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The court case affects tariffs including the 25% duties imposed on Canada and Mexico, 30% duties imposed on China, and the 10% global \"reciprocal\" tariff as well as the higher, delayed rates announced on April 2. The decision does not affect tariffs imposed via other statutes, such as the steel, aluminum, and automobile tariffs imposed via Section 232 or other tariffs on China imposed via Section 301.\nThe case may ultimately appear before the Supreme Court.\nReciprocal tariffs\nReciprocal tariffs\nThe Trump administration has made multiple modifications to its reciprocal tariffs since they were announced on April 2. New duties are set to come into effect on August 7, a full list of which are in the table above.\nThe United States has ordered an additional 40% tariff on top of country-specific reciprocal tariffs to be placed on goods it determines to have been transshipped to avoid duties. It has not defined how it would conclude if a product has been transshipped.\nA separate deal with China was announced on May 12, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 55%, and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%.\nCertain goods will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs, including energy and certain minerals not available in the United States. An exemption for computers, smartphones, and consumer electronics has been announced but the administration has suggested separate tariffs on those products and semiconductors are forthcoming.\nProducts already subject to other tariffs, like steel, aluminum, and vehicles and parts, will not be subject to the reciprocal tariffs. Products under investigation for potential tariffs are also exempt, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber.\nChina\nChina tariffs and trade agreements\nThe U.S. and China announced a trade framework on June 11. China confirmed the agreement on June 27. Details are scarce, however reporting suggests that tariffs on Chinese goods will drop to 55% (a 10% baseline \"reciprocal\" rate, 20% fentanyl tariff via IEEPA, and 25% rate from the previous Trump administration's Section 301 investigation) and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods will drop to 10%. China will resume exports of rare earth minerals, including magnets, to the U.S., and the U.S. will loosen export controls on ethane, semiconductor software, and jet engines, and not block Chinese students from attending U.S. colleges.\nChina will not be exempt from other U.S. trade measures, such as the sector and product-specific Section 232 tariffs.\nPrior to that, the Trump administration had imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese products. That's the sum of an initial 34% reciprocal tariff rate plus additional duty hikes tariff in response to China's pledged retaliation, and a separate 20% tariff on all Chinese products.\nChina had imposed a 125% retaliatory duty on U.S. products and restricted trade with the U.S. in other ways, including by restricting the export of certain rare earth minerals and magnets. China also suspended imports of logs and soybeans from certain U.S. companies as well. China placed export controls on 15 U.S. companies, placed 10 on its Unreliable Entity list, and prohibited imports of gene sequencers from Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) in addition to other nontariff measures.\nOn April 17, the administration announced fees to be charged on Chinese-owned, operated, and built vessels that dock at U.S. ports, beginning on October 14, 2025. Chinese-owned or operated ships will pay fees starting at $50 per net ton of the arriving vessel and will rise to $140 over three years. Chinese-built ships face separate fees based on tonnage or container count, whichever is higher. There are exemptions for U.S.-majority-owned vessels, small ships, and specialized vessels. Fee remissions are available for operators that replace foreign vessels with U.S.-built ships. Foreign car-carrying ships face a $150 per car unit fee. Restrictions on shipping LNG with foreign vessels will begin to phase in three years from now.\nOn May 28, the Trump administration restricted the sale of electronic design automation software used to design semiconductors to China. A lifting of at least some of those restrictions appears to be part of the June framework agreement.\nNew trade deals\nNew trade deals\nThe Trump administration has announced trade agreements with the United Kingdom and Vietnam, alongside China, that enable these countries to avoid the steepest reciprocal tariffs introduced in April.\nThe U.S.-UK trade deal\nThe United States and United Kingdom announced on June 16 a trade agreement and framework for further negotiations. Under the agreement, the United States will maintain a 10% tariff on most imports from the UK, will lower tariffs on aircraft parts and engines from the UK to zero, and provide for an annual quota of 100,000 automobiles made in the UK to face a 10% tariff versus a 27.5% duty. The UK also secured an exemption from the 50% U.S. tariff on steel and aluminum, although those measures remain subject to further negotiation.\nThe U.S.-Vietnam trade deal\nThe United States and Vietnam announced on July 2 a trade agreement that subjects Vietnamese products to a 20% tariff and products transshipped from China through Vietnam to the U.S. to a 40% tariff. Vietnam was threatened with a 46% reciprocal tariff rate. There are no details on how the United States will determine whether a product from Vietnam has been transshipped through China. The Trump administration has voiced concern about China using third countries as platforms for product assembly and export to the United States in order to avoid duties.\nPresident Trump claimed that Vietnam has agreed to lower its tariffs on U.S. products to zero as part of the agreement.\nThe U.S.-Indonesia trade deal\nThe United States and Indonesia confirmed on July 16 the outlines of a trade agreement in which the United States would apply a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods and U.S. exports to Indonesia would be tariff free. Indonesia has agreed to purchase $19 billion worth of U.S. goods, including 50 Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft, $15 billion in energy, and over $4 billion in agricultural products.\nThe Trump administration had threatened Indonesia with a 32% tariff starting on August 1. Indonesia had an $18 billion trade surplus with the United States in 2024.\nThe U.S.-Philippines trade deal\nThe United States announced a trade agreement with the Philippines on July 22 that imposes a 19% tariff on goods from that country. U.S. exports to the Philippines will face no tariffs under the agreement. Further details have not been released. The Trump administration had threatened the Philippines with a 20% tariff rate starting on August 1.\nThe U.S.-Japan trade deal\nOn July 22, the United States reached a trade agreement with Japan under which Japanese goods, including automobiles and auto parts, will face a 15% tariff when entering the United States. Japan will establish a $550 billion fund for investments in the United States in which the United States will receive 90% of the profits. Additional details on how the investment fund would operate have not been released.\nSeparate from the investment fund, Japan agreed to purchase 100 aircraft from Boeing, buy 75% more rice, increase agricultural and defense spending with U.S. companies, and engage in a liquified natural gas pipeline project in Alaska.\nJapan also agreed to approve U.S. automotive standards and lift unspecified restrictions on U.S. auto and truck imports.\nJapan secured a commitment from the United States that it would receive the lowest tariff rate on sectoral tariffs.\nThe U.S.-EU trade deal\nThe U.S. and European Union (EU) announced a trade agreement and framework for further negotiations on July 27 under which most EU goods will face a 15% tariff when entering the United States while U.S. industrial goods exported to the EU will face no tariffs and seafood and agricultural products will receive preferential tariff rates.\nThe United States will apply the lower of its Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rate or a 15% tariff to the following products from the EU: unavailable natural resources, aircraft and aircraft parts, and generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors.\nThe U.S. has also agreed to cap its applied tariffs on EU-origin pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber at 15%.\nOnce the EU introduces legislation for tariff reductions, the U,S. will cut Section 232 tariffs on EU autos and auto parts as follows:\n- No Section 232 tariffs if MFN tariff is less than or equal to 15%.\n- If MFN tariff is greater than 15%, total tariff (MFN + Section 232) will be set at 15%.\nThe U.S, and EU will explore cooperation on steel, aluminum, and derivatives to prevent overcapacity and secure supply chains, possibly through tariff-rate quotas.\nThe EU also agreed to buy $750 worth of U.S. energy, invest $600 billion in the United States, and procure additional military equipment from the U.S.\nThe two economies agreed to discuss reducing non-tariff barriers, including those that relate to auto safety standards and agricultural trade.\nThe U.S.-South Korea trade deal\nOn July 30, President Trump announced a trade agreement with South Korea that would subject South Korean goods to a 15% tariff, which would not stack with existing automobile and parts duties. The deal includes a commitment from South Korea to buy $100 billion worth of liquified natural gas from the United States and to invest $350 billion in the United States.\nSectoral tariffs, product-specific tariffs, and other tariffs\nSteel and aluminum\nSteel and aluminum tariffs\nA 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and derivatives was imposed on March 12 and will be doubled to 50% on June 4. There are no product exclusions, and agreements previously struck between the U.S. and major exporting countries for exemptions will be terminated.\nAutomobiles\nAuto tariffs\nOn March 26, President Trump announced that a 25% tariff would be imposed on imports of automobiles and automobile parts starting on April 2, 2025. The auto tariffs will be added on top of existing duties. Tariffs on USMCA-compliant vehicles will apply only to non-U.S. content. Tariffs will not apply to USMCA-compliant auto parts until a process is determined to assess non-U.S. content.\nOn April 29, President Trump signed a pair of executive order to lessen the impact of the automobile and parts tariffs. One order exempts imported automobiles and parts from the separate 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. The other order allows automakers that assemble vehicles in the U.S. which have 85% U.S. or USMCA-compliant content to apply to offset 3.75% of the auto parts tariffs for the next year and 2.5% in the year after, after which the offset will no longer be available.\nCopper tariffs\nCopper tariffs\nEffective August 1, a 50% tariff will be imposed on imports of semi-finished copper and and copper-intensive derivative products.\nSemiconductor tariffs\nSemiconductor tariffs\nOn August 6, President Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports except on those from companies that are moving production to the United States.\nA Section 232 national security investigation into semiconductor imports was launched on April 1.\niPhone & smartphone tariffs\niPhone and other smartphone tariffs\nPresident Trump threatened on May 23 to impose a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones and other smartphones built outside of the United States. There was no implementation date attached to the threat.\nPresident Trump had previously criticized Apple [NASDAQ:AAPL] for not building the iPhone in the U.S. despite the company committing to a $500 billion investment in the U.S., some of which will go towards expanding manufacturing and its relationships with U.S. suppliers.\nThe complex iPhone supply chain stretches throughout Asia, as do supply chains for most smartphones. Apple plans to move most U.S.-bound iPhone production from China to India by 2026 to reduce tariff and geopolitical risks. Moving iPhone production to the U.S. would take a massive effort.\nApple CEO Tim Cook had successfully lobbied President Trump in his first term for tariff carveouts and has continued to cultivate his personal relationship with the president.\nVenezuelan oil and gas\nVenezuelan oil and gas\nPresident Trump has stated that starting on April 2, goods from countries which purchase Venezuelan oil and gas will be subject to a 25% tariff. China, the United States, and Cuba are major purchasers of crude oil from Venezuela.\nBrazil\nBrazil\nThe United States has threatened Brazil with a 50% tariff on its exports to the United States, with many exemptions including for orange juice and aircraft parts, which would come into force on August 6. The tariffs are meant to penalize Brazil for its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of participating in an attempted coup.\nIndia\nIndia\nThe United States imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, half of which is the reciprocal tariff rate and the other half as a penalty for India purchasing Russian oil."
