      "summary": "Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Narendra Modi’s rare gathering signals a potential shift in global power dynamics, especially in energy cooperation such as the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline and increased Russian gas imports to China. The alliance may provide a counterweight to U.S. sanctions and tariffs, while also opening avenues for alternative trade routes and reduced dollar dependence. However, the partnership faces hurdles—price negotiations, India’s cautious stance, and U.S. political pressure—making its long‑term economic impact uncertain.",
