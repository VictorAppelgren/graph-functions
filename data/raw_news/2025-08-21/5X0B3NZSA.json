  "title": "Honor's Magic V5 Boasts On-Device Live AI Call Translation for Guaranteed Privacy",
  "description": "In an exclusive interview with CNET, Honor's President of Product Fei Fang reveals how the V5's AI model will allow for better speed, accuracy and privacy.",
  "content": "\"Hola! \u00bfHablas ingl\u00e9s?\" I asked the woman who answered the phone in the Barcelona restaurant.\n\nI was calling in a futile attempt to make a reservation for the CNET team dinner during Mobile World Congress this year. Unfortunately, I don't know Spanish (I learned French and German at school). And as it turned out, she didn't speak English either.\n\n\"No!\" she said, and brusquely hung up.\n\nWhat I needed in that moment was the kind of AI call translation feature that's becoming increasingly prevalent on phones \u2013 including Samsung and Google devices, and, from next week, Honor.\n\nWhen Honor unveils its Magic V5 foldable at a launch event on Aug. 28 in London, it will come with what the company is calling \"the industry's first on-device large speech model,\" which will allow live AI call translation to take place on device, with no cloud processing.\n\nCurrently the phone supports six languages \u2013 English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish. For the aforementioned reasons, I can't test all of these, but I've already had a play around with the feature and can confirm it did a very effective job of translating my garbled messages into French. I only wish I'd had it available to me in Spain when I needed it.\n\nThe model Honor has deployed was designed by the company in collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, based on the open-source Whisper model, said Fei Fang, president of product at Honor in an interview. It's been optimized for streaming speech recognition, automatic language detection and translation inference acceleration (that's speed and efficiency, to you and I).\n\nAccording to Fang, Honor's user experience studies have shown that as long as translation occurs within 1.5 seconds, it doesn't \"induce waiting anxiety,\" in anyone attempting to use AI call translation. As such, it's made sure to keep the latency to within these parameters so you won't get anxious waiting for the translation to kick in.\n\n\"We also work together with industry language experts to consistently and comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of our output,\" she added. \"The assessment is primarily based on five metrics: accuracy, logical coherence, readability, grammatical correctness and conciseness.\"\n\nIn addition to Honor's AI model, live translation is being powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. The 8 Elite's NPU allows multimodal generative AI applications to be integrated onto the device, allowing. Honor's algorithms work together with the NPU to keep power consumption as low as possible while maintaining the required accuracy of the translations, said Christopher Patrick, SVP of mobile handsets at Qualcomm.\n\nThere are a number of benefits to having the AI model embedded on the Magic V5, but perhaps the most compelling is the privacy it guarantees. It means that everything is processed locally and your calls will therefore remain completely confidential. The fact that the model lives on device and you don't need to download voice packages also reduces its storage needs.\n\nAnother benefit of running the model on the phone itself is \"offline usability,\" said Patrick. \"All conversation information is stored directly on-device and users can access it anytime, anywhere, without network restrictions.\"\n\nThe work Honor has done on AI call translation is set to be recognized at the upcoming Interspeech conference on speech science and tech. But already, Honor is thinking about how this use of AI can be used to enable other new and exciting features for the people who buy its phones.\n\n\"Beyond the essential user scenario of call translation, Honor's on-device large speech\n\nmodel will also be deployed in scenarios such as face-to-face translation [and] AI subtitles,\" said Fang. The process of developing the speech model has allowed Honor's AI team to gain extensive experience of model optimization, which it will use to develop other AI applications, she added.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we will continue to expand capabilities in areas such as emotion recognition and health monitoring, further empowering voice interactions with your on-device AI assistant,\" she said.",

      "text": "Next year's top Android phones should have even better AI capabilities and low-light camera performance and will be able to last longer when playing games. At its Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, Qualcomm revealed the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the next generation of chips that will power the best phones from Samsung, Motorola, OnePlus and more manufacturers.\nThe new chip will enable even more generative AI capabilities, which became the showcase feature that tech companies scrambled to integrate into their products this year. The smartphone industry had its own competitive race toward generative AI starting with the Galaxy AI-equipped Samsung Galaxy S24 in January, while the iPhone 16 series is set to get parts of Apple Intelligence in a future update. While nascent with only a few standout features thus far, Qualcomm's next chip aims to support more features that will give users even more reason to buy Snapdragon 8 Elite-equipped phones.\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite builds on the foundation laid by Qualcomm's previous chip, last year's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which was the company's first chip capable of generative AI capabilities. The new chip includes even more AI expertise, such as support for an AI assistant to use the camera to recognize objects in real time, and a new trick that generates lighting so that your artificially well-lit face shows up in videos with bright backgrounds. That's in addition to features that were available on the previous-generation chip, like image generation through Stable Diffusion and expanding photos beyond their original boundaries.\nThe chip has an improved neural processing unit, with more cores resulting, in what Qualcomm claims, is up to 45% faster AI performance and better power efficiency. The NPU now integrates multimodal generative AI applications on the device, meaning it can handle inputs from multiple sensors and data sources (audio, video, personal info and more) to answer queries.\nThe 8 Elite can support more than 70 tokens per second, a metric for how many inputs (text, photos and so on) can be considered when answering queries.\nWhile the previous three years of Qualcomm top-tier chips were Snapdragon Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3, the Snapdragon 8 Elite breaks from its naming convention to signify it's the best of the best, Qualcomm says. That's because the 8 Elite is the first of the company's mobile chips to use the new Qualcomm-designed Oryon CPU. To wit, the company introduced its Snapdragon X Elite PC chips a year ago, which were the first to pack Oryon CPUs.\nThe 8 Elite uses a second-generation Oryon CPU with a 3-nanometer process (smaller than the 4nm of last year's Kryo CPU), which helps enable the chip's 45% greater efficiency. Upgrades in chip architecture have led to 45% better overall performance, but the more interesting benefit is a 62% improvement in web browsing performance -- meaning consumers should see websites and web-based apps load faster.\n\"I think we've all experienced one time or another that a website, even though your phone is great, slows down and is labored. So [the Oryon CPU] is going to provide a [browsing] experience that rivals any kind of desktop,\" Chris Patrick, a Qualcomm senior vice president and general manager of the mobile handset division, said in a briefing.\nThis won't just make it faster to load websites. Many modern apps and software rely on web browsing, so having a CPU designed to speed that up will have knock-on improvements to services consumers use every day.\nThat improved efficiency applies to high-intensity activities like gaming, and Qualcomm says its new chip enables up to 2.5 hours of additional playtime.\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite also improves camera performance, mainly through a new ISP with better AI touches on autofocus, white balance and exposure, all of which happens behind the scenes and should result in better photos. The NPU can also now directly access the camera sensors themselves for real-time enhancements, including for video. Phonemakers can plug their camera algorithms directly into this pipeline.\nThe 8 Elite also has a round of connectivity improvements mainly due to -- you guessed it -- AI. The X80 5G Modem uses AI on multiantenna management to better juggle signals for clearer connections, while the FastConnect 7900 integrates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to reduce latency. This makes it possible for calls leaving Bluetooth range to hand off the connection to Wi-Fi to keep the call going.\nWe'll have to wait until new phones with the Snapdragon 8 Elite actually launch to see how much of a difference the new chip makes. But based on Qualcomm's claims, it sounds like the chip should bring a mix of general and AI-fueled upgrades to the next generation of Android phones."

      "text": "Made by Google 2025 Live: Pixel 10, Pixel Watch 4, Gemini News and Android 16\nGoogle's newest Pixel phones were revealed Wednesday in Brooklyn and CNET was there.\nGoogle has revealed its next phone lineup, the Pixel 10 series. After the usual raft of leaks and even teasers by the tech giant itself, it's finally unveiled its new lineup of devices.\nThe Made by Google event kicked off at 10 a.m. PT (12 p.m. ET, 5 p.m. BST) Wednesday, though news came in fast ahead of it. A series of new Pixel 10 phones, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold foldable, the Pixel Buds 2A and the Pixel Watch 4 have all been revealed. Here are all the details as they were revealed during the event -- which was a surprisingly fun affair with host Jimmy Fallon leading viewers on a celebrity-filled tour of all the new perks coming to Google's devices.\nHere are our first looks at Google's lineup:\nAnd that's a wrap on Made by Google\nWith a screening of the Jonas Brothers' shot-on-a-Pixel-10 music video, the Made By Google event comes to a somewhat abrupt close for us online viewers -- no send-off goodbye from Fallon, just the memories of one of the stranger product launches we've had in years. But perhaps it cracks open the door for more human chats in an era of slick presentations and more AI.\nThat's not the end of our coverage, though -- head to CNET.com for all our reviews of Google's new lineup of phones, foldables, smartwatches and earbuds. And you can keep watching the video above for Bridget and Iyaz's takes on everything that was announced.\nNick Jonas joins Jimmy Fallon\nNick Jonas joined the end of the Pixel 10 event to debut his band's music video, which was purportedly filmed on the Pixel 10.\nInside the venue, the audio for this song is so overblown, but this is the latest in a line of music videos filmed on phones. Prior Pixel phones (and the iPhone) have had similar demos.\nSubwayTakes roasts wired headphones\nKareem Rahma from the internet talk show SubwayTakes hopped out of the crowd at Made by Google to roll a tape. The TikTok-style video takes digs at the resurgence of wired headphones.\nPeloton's Cody Rigsby joins for the Fitbit sketch, er, segment\nThe Pixel Watch 4 and its Fitbit features take the spotlight for this bit, featuring Peloton coach Cody Rigsby and Google Product Manager Noah Presler. While the earlier segments have a more informercial vibe, this one feels more like a comedy sketch. Peloton content does appear in the Fitbit app, which would explain why he's a guest.\nThe Pixel 10 translation live demo went over swimmingly\nDuring a surprise demo of the Pixel 10's live call translation feature, Fallon sat down for a chat on the phone with YouTube star Karen Polinesia -- who spoke only Spanish for the demonstration.\nFallon's English was translated to Spanish for Polinesia to engage with, in a voice that sounded kind of like his own with the addition of a robotic accent. Polinesia responded in turn, and her own voice was translated into English with very little downtime between the speech and the live translation.\nThis was a tight demo, and it seemed successful overall. The Pixel 10 phone call translations shown off at Made by Google follow on the heels of the Google Meet translations, which were shown off at Google I/O earlier this year.\nThe Jonas Brothers showed off Pixel Phones being used to shoot music videos\nMusical sensation The Jonas Brothers showed how they tried to make a music video in a day with a few hundred dollars and a Pixel smartphone. The brothers shot a video for their song I Can't Lose entirely on the Pixel 10 Pro, in New York City. Their behind-the-scenes look was amusing, with entertaining bits like a leaf blower being used to simulate wind in the hair.\nThe resulting show actually looked pretty good. There was a shot with one of the brothers looking forlorn at a table in a restaurant with \"rain\" on the window -- which was water being poured out of a watering can. The demo highlighted the handset's ability to shoot in 8K and take wide-angle shots, zoom in from afar, take video at night in low-light conditions and more.\nFrom Camera Coach to shots by real photographers using the Pixel 10\nAfter the Alex Cooper chat and using Camera Coach, now we turn to a true photographer -- Brooklyn's own Andre D. Wagner, whose much-lauded photos of Black Americans have been featured in galleries and the Smithsonian. Wagner shared photos he took around New York City using a Pixel 10 phone; Google has spent years working on its True Tone to more accurately capture darker skin tones.\nCNET Editor at Large Andrew Lanxon took the Pixel 10 Pro XL on a photo safari on the streets of Paris -- check out his photos here.\nGoogle's Pixel phones can use Camera Coach to improve photos\nPodcaster Alex Cooper helped demonstrate various features of Google's Pixel phones, specifically Camera Coach. The concept is to use Camera Coach to get a great first photograph or edit photos without being a professional -- or even amateur -- photographer. Cooper showcased Camera Coach providing real-time suggestions for lighting, framing and even poses for the subjects.\nThe Made by Google set\nWhile the show changes segments, here's a wide view of the entire Made by Google set.\nGoogle doesn't want it to be scary to transition to Pixel phones\nOne of the points hammered home by Fallon's pseudo-infomercial with Lofton is that Google wants to make it easy for people to transition from other phones to the Pixel 10.\nIf you're wondering why Google would want to quell fears about that transition, it's because Pixel phones are already making up a lot of ground in terms of US market share: According to 9to5Google, the Google Pixel phone lineup has settled into a top 4 spot in the market, and makes up 3% of all US phone sales.\nGoogle seems to be pushing a general sentiment of unifying phone ecosystems -- one of the examples is the imminent death of \"blue and green\" text bubbles for messages sent between iPhone and Android phones, as Mike posted below. If the experiential divide lessens between these phones, swapping over might not be something to fear.\nGoogle's done with green and blue bubbles\nAfter almost a year of Apple's iOS supporting the RCS texting standard, Lofton declared the company is \"done\" with the green and blue bubble conversation, referring to Apple's iMessage.\nSince both iPhones and Android phones support the RCS texting standard, most texting features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing are now available, as long as RCS is turned on in the respective phone's settings. Lofton provided a brief summarization of the texting standard, mainly to argue that while the Pixel itself doesn't support Apple's iMessage, Google is otherwise done with arguing that the messaging parity isn't there.\nWe'll see if that is indeed the case in the future, as Apple and Google will likely continue to develop exclusive texting features to continue to compete with each other. And RCS doesn't yet support encryption when texting between the iPhone and Android, but that feature has been in development and is expected to eventually arrive.\nFallon demonstrates Magic Cue feature\nFallon demo'd Magic Cue, a new AI feature that will contextually surface information from other apps. Fallon's phone found the name of a restaurant from a booking email to send to Google's Osterloh and a specific photo of a dog to send to podcaster Alex Cooper.\nPixelSnap is Google's way of saying MagSafe\nGoogle's PixelSnap is following Apple's MagSafe in providing a branded way of describing magnetic attachments that work with the Pixel 10 line. But even though Google is using this marketing term, most MagSafe accessories should work with the Pixel 10 as both are based on the Qi2 magnetic wireless charging standard.\nIn short, that means even if Google makes it sound like it's special to the Pixel, it's actually much more open then that. The Pixel 10 line should work with Qi2 accessories, MagSafe accessories and these new \"PixelSnap\" accessories just fine.\nPixel 10 lineup keeps getting hyped with every other word\nEach of the Pixel devices are being run through by Fallon and Lofton. As it's a talk show, the audience is being prompted to cheer loudly every time a new device comes out.\nWhile it's starting to hurt my ears, it is on-brand. It's much like when people in Rachael Ray's talk show audience would cheer for her mashed potatoes.\nPixel 10 meets QVC -- we've gone full infomercial\nAfter a brief video with F1's Lando Norris, Fallon shifts over to a table full of Google's new devices as the company's VP of Global Marketing, Adrienne Lofton, walks him through everything announced today. The infomercial vibes are off the charts.\nFallon is bringing the energy for each and every product Lofton presents, which is another shift away from the slick commercial spots we get at Apple and Samsung shows.\nYou can get a year of Google AI Pro with purchase of a Pixel 10 Pro or Pro Fold\nGoogle revealed at its Made by Google event that if you buy a Pixel 10 Pro or Pro Fold, you'll get a year of the company's Google AI Pro artificial intelligence suite. AI Pro includes the Gemini AI assistant, Flow (a filmmaking tool), Whisk (for image-to-video creation), 1,000 monthly AI credits to use in Flow and Whisk, NotebookLM (research and writing assistant), Jules (coding agent for developers), 2TB of storage for Drive/Photos/Gmail and Gemini in Google suite (Docs, Sheets, Gmail, etc.).\nOsterloh showed how he used his Pixel phone as a sort of creative studio by leveraging the Veo text-to-video AI model to animate a video of his adorable dog, Dakota, talking into microphones like a podcast host.\nTalk show BTS\nMuch like a talk show, the crew is setting up on a second stage while a pretaped segment airs.\nAnd while conversations may appear off the cuff in this talk show format, there is definitely a teleprompter too like other TV shows.\nIs the future of tech events... talk shows?\nWatching Jimmy Fallon do a sit-down interview with Google's Rick Osterloh feels more relaxed and human than the slick, high-production events we've seen from Apple and Samsung. Perhaps the dude chatter is going on a little long when viewers are waiting for big, flashy product announcements, but at least we're spared the breathless train of commercial spots we're used to from these events. It's a little low-tech charming to see Jimmy Fallon read out printed social media posts.\nShots fired at Apple's iPhone during Fallon's Reddit read out\nWhile sitting down with Google's senior vice president of devices and services, Jimmy Fallon pulled out a compilation of the \"greatest hits\" from the Google Pixel subreddit. In the posts he showed off, different users lauded the Circle to Search feature and credited Pixel's crash detection feature with potentially saving their life.\nThings got spicy when Fallon showed off a post written by a user who said his Pixel phone photos put his friends' iPhones to shame. Shots fired -- and Osterloh shared a bashful grin with the audience during the segment.\nGoogle's Rick Osterloh is first guest\nJimmy Fallon is speaking with Rick Osterloh to kick off the event, with some reminiscing of the first Pixel launch.\nJimmy Fallon gives a Google monologue\nIn a very Tonight Show-like fashion, Fallon began with a monologue before bringing out Google's Rick Osterloh.\nTalk show host Jimmy Fallon kicks off Made by Google\nJimmy Fallon got the Made by Google event going, saying \"we're going to party as hard as we possibly can on a Wednesday at 1 p.m.\"\nPixel 10 phones get satellite-powered apps\nThe Pixel 10 lineup gets another perk: satellite-enhanced apps, thanks to T-Mobile. The phones will use the carrier's T-Satellite service to expand connectivity for three apps to start -- Google Maps, Google Messages and Find Hub -- to get functionality in areas where conventional mobile data can't reach.\nT-Mobile officially launched T-Satellite in June, which runs on SpaceX's Starlink network of microsatellites. After promising tests connecting subscribers beyond terrestrial cell networks, the carrier announced that it would be expanding this capability to apps starting Oct. 1 -- though it seems Google got an exception to launch early. Read the whole story by CNET Senior Writer Jeff Carlson.\nCNET's lead photographer captured gorgeous pictures with the Pixel 10 Pro XL\nCNET's Andrew Lanxon got hands-on time with the Pixel 10 Pro XL while taking an exclusive photo walk in Paris, during which he snapped hundreds of pictures of people, places and cats.\nWhat were his conclusions about the Pixel 10 Pro XL's cameras? Not much about the hardware has changed, but the new phone takes beautiful pictures nonetheless.\nHe wasn't big on the Camera Coach feature, but the new AI tool probably isn't designed to make any earth-shattering revelations to folks that have been in the professional photography game for over a decade. Check out Lanxon's favorite Pixel 10 Pro photos here.\nGoogle merch\nEvent swag is being handed out in the crowd of the event, such as this charming Google mug.\nWarmup guy as we wait for the event to start\nThe Made by Google event is being hosted by talk show host Jimmy Fallon. Like a broadcast show, we have a warmup guy cracking jokes to get the crowd to cheer more once the event starts.\nThe Pixel Watch 4's upgrades help it go toe-to-toe with Apple Watches\nThe Google Pixel Watch 4 had been announced, and its improvements posit it as one of -- if not the --- best Android Watch on the market. You'll find an artificial intelligence-powered health coach, satellite SOS connectivity, better battery life and simpler repairs. Starting at $349, the Pixel Watch 4 packs a lot of value. In Vanessa Hand Orellana's hands-on look, the Pixel Watch 4 felt like a solid upgrade from the Pixel Watch 3.\nWhile the Pixel Watch 4 might look similar to its predecessor, there's more screen real estate thanks to smaller bezels -- in all, you get 10% more usable screen area than before, which is 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3 to make it easier to see in broad daylight. The new watch packs an enhanced battery that Google claims will be 25% better than the Pixel Watch 3, theoretically putting it at 30 hours for the 41mm model, and 40 hours for the 45mm version -- or up to three days in low-power mode.\nIn a refreshing move, the battery and display are replaceable, so select providers can repair Google's latest smartwatch. Swappable parts are nice to see -- hopefully your watch will be OK, but if you need a fix, it might not be as much of a hassle or as expensive.\n$130 Pixel Buds 2A revealed\nGoogle has introduced the Pixel Buds 2A, which cost $130, are up for preorder now and ship Oct. 9. The earbuds come in the colors hazel or iris and look similar to the $229 Pixel Buds Pro 2. While they are a more affordable option, they don't provide the same performance or feature set.\nWe can expect to hear about the earbuds at today's Made by Google event, which starts at 1 p.m. ET. To see all the ways the Pixel Buds 2A differ from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, check out David Carnoy's comparison.\nThe Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are evolutions, not overhauls\nThe Made by Google event is our first look at the new Pixel 10 phone, which builds on the design of its predecessor by adding new tools like a Gemini AI-powered Camera Coach and refining existing features such as a higher maximum screen brightness. For the first time, instead of being a scaled-down version of the Pixel Pro series, the Pixel 10 is more of a hybrid model that has a similar design and model as the Pixel 10 Pro but with the same main and ultrawide cameras that you'd find in the Pixel 9A.\nSpeaking of the Pixel 10 Pro, we got a chance to see that upcoming phone, too. The new phone, which CNET's Andrew Lanxon described as an \"evolution of its predecessor\" rather than an overhaul, includes the Tensor G5 processor and an increasing amount of AI tools -- especially for photography. The Pixel 10 Pro also integrates Qi2 wireless charging technology, which should help it charge faster when you don't have a wired charger on hand.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold may be the most durable foldable\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is here, and it achieves a surprising feat: a foldable that's been certified with an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, which is the level of durability seen in most conventional flat smartphones released today. That means you won't have to worry about small dust particles and sand, making the Pixel 10 Pro Fold the first beach-ready foldable, as CNET Senior Technology Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti noted in her review.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold packs plenty of other upgrades, like a Tensor G5 chip, a larger 5,015-mAh battery than last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold (5,650 mAh), Qi2 wireless charging with magnetic functionality to snap on chargers and more. Check out CNET's full Pixel 10 Pro Fold review here.\nThe breakfast spread at Made by Google\nNow that we're inside the Made by Google event, we're filling up on snacks and coffee ahead of the show. Reporters need carbs and caffeine, too! OK, maybe not this many carbs.\nBadges in hand for Made by Google\nWe've arrived at Made by Google\nWe're here at the Made by Google event in Brooklyn about an hour before the event starts, and I -- along with CNET Associate Social Producer Tara Brown -- will be adding our live updates from the event. See you inside!\nYou can probably expect Pixel 9 pricing for the new phones -- at least for now\nIt's rumored that the Pixel 10 phone line will retail at the same prices as their Pixel 9 predecessors. That means you might expect to get your hands on the base 128GB storage Pixel 10 for $799, and the 256GB model for $899. Following this trend, the base storage Pixel 10 Pro would retail for $999 and the base 256GB Pixel 10 Pro XL would retail for $1,199.\nSupposedly, the Pixel 10 phone line won't be affected by tariff pricing at launch, though this could change at a later date. CNET will continue coverage of pricing fluctuations for all of the newest technology.\nGoogle's own teaser showed the standard Pixel 10's big upgrade\nLast month, Google itself dropped an official tease of the Pixel 10 -- a short animation showing the back of the phone, which looks roughly like last year's Pixel 9 phones with a bit more metal framing around the camera bump. But the big addition is what's inside the camera bump: a third camera.\nThe Pixel 9 had a 50-megapixel main camera and 48-megapixel ultrawide shooter, so presumably the third camera would be a telephoto for distance photography, much like with the Pro versions of Google's phones. Apple retains twin cameras on its standard iPhone 16 to differentiate its regular and Pro models, so Google could get an edge by adding that zoom camera to its base Pixel 10 -- and would put in on par with the Samsung Galaxy S25, which also has three rear cameras.\nWhere is the Pixel 10 Flip?\nGoogle launched its first foldable phone, the Pixel Fold, in 2023. Last year, it followed-up with a top-to-bottom upgrade of the phone called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Looking at rumors and teases by Google, it's safe to say that the company will be launching a Pixel 10 Pro Fold during its Made by Google event on Wednesday. But where is the Pixel 10 Flip?\nGoogle is one of the only phone-makers with a single foldable model. Samsung has its Galaxy Z Fold line and its Galaxy Z Flip series. When is Google going to launch a flip phone? Or is the company going the Motorola route and sticking to just one kind of foldable? While I don't think Google will launch a Pixel Flip, it will be curious how much the company leans into foldables for its Pixel line.\nI'm here for the Pixel 10's rumored summer splash of color\nThe Made by Google event is about to reveal the Pixel 10, and if the rumors are true, the new phone will be uncharacteristically colorful. The lineup for the base phone will supposedly include obsidian, indigo, frost and lemonade colors. That zesty yellow phone is the refreshing change of pace that I want to see, and it'll totally add summery vibes to anyone's pocket.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro has a similarly fun set of rumored colors, though none of them sound quite as eye-catching as the mellow yellow Pixel 10. Android Headlines reported on rumored renders that display obsidian, porcelain, moonstone and jade (aka black, white, gray and green) models for the Pro. Jade is a cool tone that might turn a few heads, but it's no lemonade.\nNoted leaker Evan Blass posted additional Pixel 10 photos, lending more credence to the rumors about these Pixel 10 colors. Let's cross our fingers that the light yellow adds some flair to the phone without looking too gaudy.\nWill the Pixel 10 lineup support the Qi2 wireless standard?\nA rumored change to the Pixel 10 lineup could make the phones more attractive -- literally and figuratively. The Pixel 10 series could come with built-in magnets as part of a shift to fully supporting Qi2 wireless charging. If the rumors are true, you could use magnetic accessories (potentially including Apple's MagSafe chargers) interchangeably with the iPhone and the Pixel.\nThe shift could be significant for the Qi2 wireless standard, as the HMD Skyline is the other Android phone currently supporting Qi2. (There are examples of Qi2 charging with phone cases, but magnets built into Android devices aren't common.) In addition to magnetic compatibility, the Qi2 version also brings a faster wireless charging speed than the earlier version, Qi.\nRight now, whether the Pixel 10 lineup will support the Qi2 wireless standard is unclear. An image posted by leaker Evan Blass seems to show a phone with a circular charger attached via magnets. According to a report from Android Authority, the near future could see us shopping for magnetic \"Pixelsnap\" accessories from Google.\nJimmy Fallon hosting Made by Google 2025 and already he's dropping spoilers\nLate-night host Jimmy Fallon is taking on a daytime side gig as the emcee of the Made by Google event tomorrow. In a TikTok video released by the Google Pixel account, Fallon appears excited to introduce new features such as [bleep], [bleep] and of course [bleep] \"which I'm not allowed to talk about.\" It's a light-hearted jab, given that so many rumored details of the Pixel 10 and other products have leaked ahead of the event.\n@googlepixel @Jimmy Fallon is officially hosting #MadeByGoogle and he wants to tell you all about it (a little too much if you ask us). #GooglePixel \u266c original sound - Google Pixel\nWe may see Google's Tensor G5 chip in the Pixel 10 Android phone lineup\nGoogle's Pixel 10 handsets may use the Tensor G5 chip. The Tensor G4 was at the core of last year's Pixel 9 series, so it logically follows that the company will feature the Tensor G5 as its predecessor -- unless there's a name change. Rumors by Android Authority suggest the new chip might be made by chip fabricator TSMC. Moreover, the G5 system on a chip reportedly uses a 3nm process node, meaning that it could be both more powerful and more efficient than the G4, which uses 4nm, but real-world differences in battery life and CPU or GPU performance may be marginal at best.\nIn our Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review, we found its benchmarked performance unimpressive. The G4 was only marginally better than the Pixel 8 Pro's G3 processor and fell short of competitors like the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, although performance was solid in everyday usage. Whether playing a demanding game of Genshin Impact or generating AI images, the Pixel Pro 9 XL never felt slow, even if it could have packed more oomph. We're hoping -- and expecting -- that even if the G5 doesn't win any benchmarking competitions, that it's similarly snappy in daily use.\nHow to watch the Made by Google Pixel 10 Event\nOn Aug. 20, Google is slated to unveil its latest Pixel devices, including phones, earbuds, wearables and more, at its Made by Google event. The event kicks off at 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Aug. 20. You can stream the Made by Google event on YouTube.\nI hope the Pixel 10 has better AI, instead of just more AI\nThe Made by Google event is tomorrow and we will officially see the Pixel 10 line unveiled. Last year's Pixel 9 series showed Google integrating Gemini into its line of phones. One of the most impactful moments I had with the Pixel 9 Pro was using Gemini Live. Nearly everything about it wowed me from being able to talk to it like a person, to the interface. I did get some less than reliable answers (also very much like a person) but could see the possibilities.\nFor the Pixel 10 series, I'd like Google to really elevate the quality of the AI integrated on the Pixel. Focus on quality over quantity and aim at using AI to solve common problems instead of more niche ones."

      "text": "The Galaxy S24 series, Samsung's latest flagship devices, comes equipped with exclusive AI features for photo editing, real-time translations, automatically generated summaries for webpages and more.\nAnd thanks to the One UI 6.1 update in March, the Galaxy S23 series now has these same Galaxy AI features and settings.\nDon't miss: Welcome to AI Atlas, CNET's Guide to Today's Artificial Intelligence\nHowever, not all of these features are on by default. If you own the Galaxy S24 or the Galaxy S23, and you're still unsure about everything your phone can do, here are five AI settings that you need to enable right now.\nFor more, check out our review of the Galaxy S24 Ultra and why the Galaxy S24 Ultra could be doing so much more with AI.\nGet real-time translations during phone calls\nThe first setting you'll definitely want to enable is Live Translate, which features near-real-time voice translations between you and whoever you're speaking with on the phone. Before we get into how the translation tool works, let's turn it on first.\nIn Settings, go to Advanced features > Advanced intelligence > Phone and toggle on Live translate. Before you start using Live Translate, choose your language, the language of the person you're speaking with and the translation voices. (There are 13 languages, including simplified Chinese and Mexico, Spain and US Spanish, with more on the way, the company said.) You also have the option to mute your voice and the other person's voice so that you hear only the translation voice.\nTo use Live Translate, make your phone call, hit the Call assist button and then choose Live translate to start real-time translation. A screen showing your conversation, with both original and translated text, will appear in real time as you speak. After you speak, the translation tool will translate what you say into the other participant's language. If you have your voices muted, participants will only hear the translation voices speak.\nUse generative AI to edit your photos\nOne of the biggest AI tools on the Galaxy S24 is Generative Edit, which allows you to erase, recompose and remaster the photos you take on your phone, using generative AI. For example, if you want to resize an object or remove a person in a photo, Generative Edit can generate a new background to fill in any missing pieces.\nLike the rest of the features and settings in this guide, Generative Edit is not on by default, so you'll need to turn it on in your settings. Go to Settings > Advanced features > Advanced intelligence > Photo Editor and toggle on Generative edit.\nIn the Gallery app, hit Edit and then tap the AI button, with three stars, to use generative AI. You can then straighten the photo out, and generative AI will help generate more background, or you can draw on the image to move, remove or resize any object in the photo, with generative AI once again creating a background to fill the image in.\nAutomatically create a summary of your voice recording\nThe Voice Recorder on your Galaxy S24 doesn't just record audio. It's also capable of transcribing the audio into text and then using AI to summarize the text, which is useful if you're recording a lecture at school or a presentation at work. However, before you can summarize your transcriptions, you have to enable the feature in your settings.\nGo to Settings > Advanced features > Advanced intelligence > Voice Recorder > Summaries and toggle it on. Turning Summaries on will automatically create a summary of your audio recordings using artificial intelligence.\nIf you want to check out the transcription tool at work, tap on an audio recording in the Voice Recorder application, create a transcript and then go into the Summary tab. At the top of the summary you'll see keywords you can tap to check out specific sections in the summary, and underneath that is where the summary lives, full of AI-generated headers and bullet points.\nGet summaries of any site you visit in your web browser\nAnother AI tool that you need to enable before you can use it allows you to summarize pretty much any webpage you visit in your browser. For this to work, however, you'll need to be in Samsung's default web browser, which is simply called Internet. The AI summary tool doesn't work in Chrome or any other third-party web browser.\nIn Settings > Advanced features > Advanced intelligence > Samsung Internet > Summarize, toggle the tool on. Now you can get summaries for webpages.\nGo to the Samsung web browser, visit a site you want to summarize and press the AI icon (three stars) that appears in the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. Hit Summarize and you'll get an AI-generated summary of the webpage. Below you can see a summary of David Lumb's CNET story on the Samsung Galaxy Ring.\nProcess data only on your device when using AI\nThe final AI setting you should consider enabling is for your own privacy. In Settings > Advanced features > Advanced intelligence, you can toggle on Process data only on device so that any data processed via artificial intelligence is done only on your device, instead of online.\nUsually, your data is sent to a third party only to generate a response for whatever feature you're using. It's not used for machine learning or advertisements, and your data is immediately deleted from third-party servers as soon as your generation is complete. But if you feel safer with your data staying on your device, you should enable this setting.\nSamsung does warn that toggling this feature on will provide worse results and certain AI features may not work.\nWhile you're here, check out the best phone to buy in 2024."

      "text": "The best phones in 2025 have a battery life that lasts a day or more, cameras that take stunning photos and vibrant displays, perfect for TikTok or watching The Gilded Age. 2025 has been an incredible year for smartphones. We test dozens of phones each year, but only consider a few to be truly great. From Google's Pixel 9 series and Apple's iPhone 16 family to Samsung's Galaxy S25 series and foldable phones including the Motorola Razr Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 7, these are the best phones you can buy. If you're looking for a new Pixel phone or iPhone, we recommend waiting a few weeks as both Google and Apple will likely be unveiling their newest phones soon.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat is the best phone for most people?\nThe best phone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and doing summaries of messages and webpages. There's also adds a ChatGPT integration to Siri.\nThe phones also have an Action button that can be programed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at, a bit like Google Lens. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years.\nBest phones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life\n- More AI features feel practical\nCons\n- Several gimmicky AI features\n- Not many changes over the S24\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nWhy we like it\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\nPros\n- Robust design\n- Bright high resolution inner screen\n- Battery life should last you a day or more\n- It's so damn fun to use\nCons\n- Cameras take decent photos but suffer from motion blur\n- Only three years of major OS updates\n- Gets warm playing games and using the camera frequently\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's Razr Plus, which won a CNET Editor's Choice Award. It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed.\nBut in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.\nWhy we like it\nThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.\nWho's it best for\nSomeone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit. If you find yourself in places with sand, dirt and other fine particles, the Razr Ultra (like all foldable phones) isn't worth the risk. The Razr Ultra has the same class-leading IP-rating for dust and water resistance, but the dust resistance is only for particles 1-mm or larger.\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho's it best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- The screen is delightfully bright\n- Cameras are good for $499\n- Gemini Live Video AI has potential to be useful\n- Solid build\n- The under-$500 price\nCons\n- Battery life is just OK, will get through a day\n- Processor is serviceable (curious about longevity)\n- Lacks emergency SOS satellite texting\nFor $499, Google's Pixel 9A truly feels like you're getting more bang for your buck. It comes with several significant upgrades from last year's Pixel 8A: a fresh design, new display, larger battery, slightly more powerful chip, increased durability and upgraded software features.\nBut don't get me wrong -- it's not a perfect phone. There are places where Google had to compromise to keep the price under $500, like the lack of satellite connectivity for emergencies available on the $799 Pixel 9. Overall, though, I think the compromises Google made were smart and that the Pixel 9A is worth every penny. Read our Google Pixel 9A review.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9A is proof that you don't need to spend more than $500 to get a great phone. It can handle all you daily tasks from scrolling social media and news feeds and swiping through TikTok videos to taking a beautiful photo and lasting a day on a single charge.\nWho's it best for?\nIn theory: anybody. The Pixel 9A is for anyone who wants 95% of what a $1,000 phone can do at half the price.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone who wants the absolute fastest processor or the most cutting edge cameras.\nPros\n- USB-C port is more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.\nThe iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.\nWho it's best for\nThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.\nWho shouldn't get it\nApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.\nPros\n- Genuinely fun new AI skills\n- Sleek new design\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Cameras can take great daytime shots\nCons\n- Camera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro\n- Gemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.\nThe phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.\nWhy we like it\nGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999.\nPros\n- The 6.9-inch screen is immersive, with lovely colors and contrast\n- The 4.1-inch screen looks incredible\n- It's durable and survived a drop onto concrete\n- One UI 8 (Android 16) runs wonderfully\n- $1,100 is still a lot, but Samsung gives the phone more value than the Flip 6\nCons\n- Gets warm when recording videos and playing games\n- Battery life is the same as the Flip 6 despite a bigger battery\n- Cover screen software has room to grow\nWhen I first got my hands on Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip 7, I was delighted to discover that it has a smaller crease, larger cover screen, thinner design and bigger battery compared to last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6. But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.\nThe Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.\nEvery time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.\nThe Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.\nWhy we like it\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.\nWho is it best for\nIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance with games, movies and animations\nCons\n- Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price\n- Rival phones at the same price have better cameras\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity \u2013 without upgrading all the way to the Ultra \u2013 the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.\nThat said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.\nWhy we like it\nWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.\nWho it's best for\nIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses\nPros\n- Beautiful design that feels durable\n- Fun and somewhat useful AI features\n- New ultrawide camera takes good photos\n- 7 years of software updates for longevity\nCons\n- More expensive that previous Pixels and competitors\n- Doesn't feel that different from Pixel 8\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google\u2019s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren\u2019t must-haves, and they\u2019re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro.\nBest phones compared\n| Product | Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Apple iPhone 15 | Google Pixel 9 | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Moto G Power 5G (2024) | Motorola Razr Plus (2024) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556 x 1,179 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.3-inch LTPO OLED; 2,856x1,280 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.8-inch LTPO OLED; 2,992x1,344 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.8-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch LCD; 2,400 x 1,080 pixels, 60-120Hz refresh rate | 4-inch pOLED; 1,272 x 1,080 pixels; 1-165Hz variable refresh rate; 6.9-inch pOLED; 2,640 x 1,080 pixels, 1-165Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 422 ppi | 495 ppi | 486 ppi | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 501 ppi | 391 ppi | Cover: 417 ppi; Internal: 413 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 2.82x5.81x0.31 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6.4x3x0.3 inches | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. | 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in. | 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in. | 6.6 x 3 x 0.3 in. | Open: 6.75 x 2.91 x 0.28 in Closed: 3.47 x 2.91 x 0.6 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 71.6x147.6x7.8 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 162.8x76.6x8.5 mm | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm | 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm | 167.2 x 76.4 x 8.5mm | Open: 171.42 x 74 x 7.09mm Closed: 88.09 x 74 x 15.32mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 170 g (6 oz.) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 171g (6.02 oz.) | 198g (7 oz.) | 199g (7 oz.) | 221g (7.8 oz) | 162g (5.71 oz.) | 190g (6.70 oz.) | 218g (7.69 oz.) | 201g (7.09 oz.) | 189g (6.67 oz) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 17 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 14 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto), 50-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 8-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide) 50-megapixel (2x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 16-megapixel | 32-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 8K | 8K | 8K | 1,080p | 4K |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A16 Bionic | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Mediatek Dimensity 7020 | Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 |\n| RAM + storage | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 8GB RAM + 128GB | 12GB + 256GB |\n| Expandable storage | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None | None | None | None | None | None | Up to 1TB | None |\n| Battery | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

The Fold 7 replaces last year's Fold 6 and comes with a completely new design that makes it thinner, lighter and feel more like a \"regular phone.\" The Flip 7 is the best-built foldable flip phone we tested from Samsung. The thinner design and bigger displays are the headline features.\nFactors to consider when buying a new phone\nPick the most important feature: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? This will help narrow down your choices. Phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy S25 Ultra cost well over $1,000, for example, but pack large batteries that will last most people a day and a half to two days on a single charge.\nDon't dismiss $500 to $800 phones: You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a more expensive flagship model can do for a fraction of the price. Google's Pixel 9 (which starts at $799) packs a great camera, a bright screen and unique AI features, but the $499 Pixel 8A has most of the same key specs and comes at a lower price.\nShop Cyber Monday: Look for sales and deals close to holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday.\nConsider last year's models: When a new phone gets launched, stores and carriers discount their older phones to sell off existing stock.\nSee the phone in person: It's worth going to a store and trying out a potential phone. You may love or hate the way it looks and feels.\nDecide on Android or iPhone: Do you have a lot of iPhone apps and Apple subscriptions? Stick with an iPhone. If you've invested in loads of Android apps, you may want to stay on that side of the fence. Otherwise, it's simple enough to switch platforms.\nBudget for a case and screen protector: Phones sold today are more durable than phones from even a few years ago, but it still might be a good idea to protect your phone with a case to keep it in tip-top shape.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios, focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates, or to compare it against new phones from competitors such as Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K slow motion video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, or the new Magic Editor photo tools that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, as a simple, replicable measure of pure battery life, which isn't always included in the initial review but sometimes added later in an update.\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure each phone's performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Most noteworthy is how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations, and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nPerformance measuring\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther phones we tested\nWhile Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review.\nPhone FAQs\nWhat is the best time to buy a phone?\nHow long should a phone battery last?\nHow much storage should I get on a phone?\nWhat are the best phone brands currently?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nGoogle is expected to launch the Pixel 10 series in August. There's also buzz for the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models. We've rounded up rumors, leaks and analysis on the iPhone 17 Air (one of several nicknames for Apple's next iPhone). Read CNET's iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more info."
