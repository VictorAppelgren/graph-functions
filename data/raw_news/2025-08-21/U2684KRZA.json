  "content": "Formula Fixed founder James Grady wants to put cyclists on the moon. He\u2019ll settle for packed arenas.\n\nThe co-founder of Formula Fixed, a first-of-its-kind cycling league that proudly boasts its intentions to bring the sport into \u201cthe TikTok era,\u201d has brought his startup racing venture to go-kart tracks and small events throughout the country, including stops in the District of Columbia, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nThe qualifying events are a baby step before pivoting to larger venues such as the District\u2019s Capital One Arena.\n\n\u201cEvery kid in America grows up riding a bike. We really think there\u2019s an opportunity here to provide an entertaining sports product,\u201d said Mr. Grady, who founded the venture with his wife, Claire. \u201cWe, as Americans, are hardwired to like cycling, but there\u2019s no aspirational professional league to keep people\u2019s interest beyond childhood.\u201d\n\nThe American people need a cycling league, he said, one that offers races he says are more dynamic and relatable to U.S. fans than road events like the Tour de France.\n\nFixed-gear racing is the right format, according to Mr. Grady, who spent more than a decade setting up cycling events for Red Bull.\n\nUnlike the high-end bikes used by road race riders on mountain courses, fixed-gear bikes offer the simplest form of cycling. There are no fancy chain systems to control top speed through different gears. They don\u2019t have brakes, either. Cyclists have to pedal backwards or skid when they need to slow down.\n\nThe results? Highly technical races that often result in high-speed crashes, perfect for drama-hungry spectators. An elite athlete can easily hit the pavement or a barricade, boxed out by a fearless amateur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only version of a bike that still scares me s\u2014-less,\u201d said Lucas Bourgoyne, the 2025 U.S. Pro Criterium champion.\n\nCriterium racing is the more common discipline for cyclists in the U.S. In those events, racers perform laps on closed circuits ranging in size from 400 meters to 10 kilometers, often on closed-off city streets.\n\n\u201cFixed gears are just so simple,\u201d said Luke Fetzer, another criterium racer who has started competing with Formula Fixed. \u201cThere\u2019s no brakes, no gears, frames can be pretty cheap. It\u2019s a much more welcoming aspect of the sport than, say, road cycling, where bikes cost upwards of $15,000.\u201d\n\nMr. Fetzer and Mr. Bourgoyne joined Formula Fixed qualifiers last year after racking up podium finishes in criterium races around the country. A strong performance in the first fixed-gear heat left them feeling confident. They proceeded to finish near the bottom of the pack in the rest of the qualifiers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so scary. These guys \u2014 and girls \u2014 have balls of steel,\u201d Mr. Fetzer said of fixed-gear racing. \u201cThey\u2019re just fearless and made me and [Mr. Bourgoyne] look like rookies.\u201d\n\nThe fixed-gear culture is \u201cgrungier\u201d than your typical cycling scene, Mr. Bourgoyne said. Its roots call back to bike couriers, fearless speedsters known for flying around urban settings with little regard for their own safety.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really plugged into the culture. It\u2019s a lot closer to skateboarding than it is to cycling like, old White guys on bikes, right? And that\u2019s probably what a lot of people think of when they think of cycling in America,\u201d Mr. Grady said.\n\nThe Tour de France, he argues, is an event best served by newspapers or traditional TV broadcasts for older viewers. Formula Fixed is designed for social media and the young generation of potential fans who are often glued to their phones.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing really appeals to young people, from the fixed-gear bike itself. There\u2019s a little bit of danger associated with it, because it doesn\u2019t have any brakes and it only has one gear,\u201d Mr. Grady said. \u201cSo, we get that much younger audience.\u201d\n\nThat danger appeals to the riders, too. Mr. Fetzer and Mr. Bourgoyne aren\u2019t fixed-gear experts yet, but they are self-proclaimed adrenaline junkies. Nothing strikes fear into their hearts like racing without brakes.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Mr. Fetzer said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been scared on my bike in a long time, so it\u2019s perfect for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love the fact that if you make a mistake, you\u2019re going to lose all your skin,\u201d Mr. Bourgoyne agreed.\n\nThe Gradys also play into that daredevil culture more than other cycling events typically do. The founders depicted their vision for the league as closer to the professional wrestling world than something like the buttoned-up PGA Tour.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, wrestling is just two people in a ring grabbing each other\u2019s butts,\u201d Mr. Grady said. \u201cBut what WWE does really well is create these larger-than-life characters.\u201d\n\nFormula Fixed athletes receive customized introductions, giving viewers storylines to follow and racers to root for. Even at the qualifiers, a proof of concept for the league, the Gradys are shining spotlights on individual riders.\n\nThe events come with a social media blitz, often including a countdown of \u201criders to watch.\u201d\n\nThe Gradys brought that flair to the District last weekend with events outside the crumbling RFK Stadium and the K1 Speed go-kart track in Jessup, Maryland.\n\nAn accompanying livestream of the qualifying races was broadcast on YouTube, complete with trivia about the riders\u2019 accolades and insight into their techniques.\n\n\u201cI was not a person in the sport last year,\u201d said Mr. Fetzer. \u201cThey made me feel like a rock star. It gave each rider this persona, so each race is captivating.\u201d\n\nThe setup of the events might be the biggest shift from traditional cycling. A Formula Fixed race day begins with heats of eight riders competing in laps, inspired by the Olympic velodrome races.\n\nBut each lap, the last-place rider is eliminated. This continues until only one rider from the heat remains.\n\nUnlike the high-speed velodrome, these races are more technical, with several hairpin turns that test riders\u2019 abilities. It\u2019s the difference between NASCAR\u2019s circular tracks and a Formula One road course.\n\n\u201cIt really emphasizes skill and risk-taking,\u201d Mr. Grady said, calling the competitions a \u201cMario Kart-style\u201d event. \u201cWe\u2019re built for virality. The five-minute heats, they\u2019re just like, bam, bam, bam. They\u2019re very fast. It\u2019s more of a spectacle.\u201d\n\nThe elimination style, with short laps and a do-or-die intensity, is designed for what Mr. Bourgoyne called \u201cthe American attention span.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not this five-hour event. You think of the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong with a five-hour jaunt through the mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cFormula Fixed is the Americanized version of that, where it\u2019s a short format.\u201d\n\nThe indoor venues are unique in the American cycling world. After years of organizing outdoor races for Red Bull, Mr. Grady saw an opportunity. He couldn\u2019t charge tickets for those criterium races.\n\nAfter shutting down roads, spectators could only see a fraction of the events at a time. Different portions of the track would be blocked by buildings or turns.\n\n\u201cYou only see a bit of the race, a bit of the story,\u201d Mr. Grady said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would pay for that.\u201d\n\nHe quickly learned that people would pay to see Formula Fixed. One seat can view all the action. They\u2019ve sold out of tickets for multiple qualifier events. That bodes well for the large-scale launch next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based off the premise of every other great American sport. Under the lights, where you can get a beer and a hot dog with your dad,\u201d Mr. Bourgoyne said. \u201cIt pulls all the best parts, I think, of sports together. And it puts them into one place.\u201d\n\nThe indoor venues have an added benefit.\n\nPutting uber-competitive cyclists on brakeless bikes on go-kart tracks is similar to a NASCAR event. People love to see a crash.\n\n\u201cAnd, oh, hey, you know, that guy might smack into a barrier at 35 miles per hour and he\u2019s going to get up and have a broken bone and be cut to shreds,\u201d Mr. Bourgoyne said. \u201cEveryone loves some good gore at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nNiche sporting ventures are having their day across the U.S., a point in Formula Fixed\u2019s favor.\n\nThe Savannah Bananas are selling out NFL stadiums with their Globetrotter-esque brand of baseball. The Unrivaled three-on-three women\u2019s basketball league smashed viewership projections ahead of the WNBA season. Professional pickleball teams are racking up multimillion-dollar valuations.\n\nRepresentatives from Formula Fixed believe there\u2019s room for cycling, too.\n\n\u201cThey really have a unique opportunity to blow it up, unlike anything before,\u201d Mr. Bourgoyne said. \u201cWith James and Claire, you\u2019ve got some damn good captains. So, if anyone\u2019s going to champion the charge, I think they\u2019re a pretty damn good dynamic duo at doing it.\u201d\n\nGo-kart tracks are just the start. The next step up would be arenas, similar to the ones that host monster truck events on a yearly basis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll stair-step up to the stadiums. You know the Savannah Bananas weren\u2019t playing in Camden Yards for the very first season,\u201d Mr. Grady said. \u201cThey had to really work to get there.\u201d\n\nThe Formula Fixed co-founder isn\u2019t a stranger to bold ideas. He brought his most out-of-this-world pitch to Red Bull about two years ago.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to send a couple of riders to the moon to race bikes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that I like to think about.\u201d\n\nThe cycling fanatic was met with a resounding \u201cmaybe one day.\u201d\n\nIt might not be as difficult as space travel, but the Gradys say they\u2019re still operating at a disadvantage on their new venture.\n\n\u201cWe are neither famous nor wealthy,\u201d Mr. Grady said. \u201cThat\u2019s two strikes against us when we\u2019re trying to launch a professional sports league.\u201d\n\nThe Savannah Bananas had the benefit of being an MLB affiliate before branching out full-time into \u201cBanana Ball.\u201d Unrivaled had an array of WNBA stars backing it. Even Major League Pickleball boasted big-name backers such as actress Eva Longoria, Olympian Michael Phelps and NBA star Kevin Durant.\n\nWithout that support, Formula Fixed is starting at go-kart tracks before moving to NBA-size arenas.\n\n\u201cSomebody with a lot of money could just put on bike races in stadiums, but right now, the market isn\u2019t ready for it,\u201d Mr. Grady said. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing the market, because if we start small, we can get a good fan base. Then we\u2019ll grow that fan base. The goal is to just start that flywheel.\u201d",
